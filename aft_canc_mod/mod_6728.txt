He does not have pain in his leg although this leg has felt heavy for the past 2 months which prompted his initial CT scan which diagnosed his brain metastases.
He does have left sided leg weakness but this has been stable.
He was referred to the emergency room directly from oncology clinic for evaluation of potential DVT.
He had a left lower extremity ultrasound which was positive for DVT.
He had a CTA which was preliminarily negative for pulmonary embolism.
He had a non-contrast CT of the head which showed three hemorrhagic metastases (unclear how these compare in size post-radiation).
On arrival to the ICU he has no specific complaints.
Left lower extremity weakness is unchanged.
No blurry vision.
Gait has been unstable since diagnosis of metastatic lesions.

Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 97.1 BP: 117/79 P: 82 R: 15 O2: 99% on RA General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses.
Erythema over left leg with non-pitting edema.
No calf tednerness.
No clubbing or cyanosis.
Strength 4/5 in the left lower extremity, [**6-4**] in the right lower extremity, sensation intact throughout, reflexes 2+ in the upper extremities, 1+ in left lower extremity, 2+ right lower extremity, decreased tone in left lower extremity.
Small right subsegmental pulmonary embolism in the right posterior lower lobe pulmonary artery, no dissection or aortic aneurysm.
Large left upper lobe soft tissue mass with pulmonary nodules in the right upper lobe and left lower lobe as described.
Probable metastasis in the spleen.
HEAD CT W/O CONTRAST ([**2126-9-11**]) Multifocal high-attenuation foci with the perilesional vasogenic edema, in setting of known metastases suspicious for hemorrhagic intracranial metastases.
No prior comparisons available to assess for change.
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT ([**2126-9-11**]) Extensive DVT in the left lower extremity extending from common femoral vein to posterior tibial veins.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 year old male with a history of metastatic melanoma to brain, lung and liver who presents with a left lower extremity DVT.
# LLE DVT and small PE: DVT found in LLE with small subsegmental PE, but patient also has hemorrhagic brain metastases shown on head CT preventing anticoagulation.
Patient has an extensive clot burden in the LLE, but anticoagulation was held in light of the hemorrhagic potential of the brain metastasis.
Pt tolerated procedure well without complications.
# Metastatic Melanoma: Hemorrhagic brain metastasis with surrounding vasogenic edema demonstrated on CT head.
On admission to ICU neurologic exam was notable for left lower extremity weakness and decreased reflexes.
# Hypercalcemia: Likely related to malignancy.
# Thrombocytopenia: Latest platelet count 93K.
No evidence of bleeding.
# Hypertension:  Patient was continued on home dose of lisinopril .
# Hyperlipidemia:  Patient was continued on home dose of simvastatin .
Deep venous thrombosis and small PE with IVC filter placement.
Metastatic Melanoma to brain, lung, liver s/p 10 cycles XRT in [**Month (only) 205**] .
Hypertension , Hyperlipidemia, Steroid induced hyperglycemia   Discharge Condition: Stable, ambulatory, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for Left leg swelling.
It was determined that you have a deep venous clot in your leg.
Imaging also showed you have a very small clot in your lungs.
Due to the melanoma in your brain, the risks of anti-coagulation outweigh the benefits.
You tolerated the procedure well without any problems.
Please call your PCP or return to the emergency room if you develop fevers, chills, shortness of breath, pain with breathing, palpitations, worsening leg swelling, , or abdominal pain.
