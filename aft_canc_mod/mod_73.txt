Admission Date:  [**2115-11-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2115-11-26**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4282**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: CyberKnife mapping   History of Present Illness: Dr. [**Known lastname 5459**] is an 85 year old gentleman with history of COPD on 6L home O2 (FEV1 28% predicted), recurrent DVT on coumadin, and recently diagnosed LUL NSCLC who is admitted with hypotension.
Today he was scheduled for LUL fiducial electrode placement and was noted to have relative hypotension with [**Name (NI) 5462**] in the 90's.
His primary oncologist noted L > R weakness on examination and neurology was consulted out of concern for potential stroke.
The patient dates the onset of worsening generalized weakness and gait instability for the last 2 months, similar to around the time he was diagnosed with LUL mass.
The patient complains of decreased PO intake and DOE, unchanged from recent baseline.
He may have had one episode of dysuria today but denies urinary frequency.
Of note, the patient was on a prednisone taper for COPD that ended the day prior to admission.
Past Medical History: - Non Small Cell Lung Cancer - diagnosed [**2115-10-22**] via CT guided biopsy, without known metastases - Thyroid Papillary (Hurthle Cell) Carcinoma - Diagnosed by FNA [**2115-10-30**] - COPD - FEV1 28% predicted; rising home O2 requirements in recent weeks, 4L normally, now on 6L - Recurrent DVT - started about four years ago, not in setting of travel, currently anticoagulated on coumadin.
- Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Spinal stenosis .
Family History: No family history of stroke or neurological disease.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, dry MM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: Supple, no JVD or carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Scattered crackles, more prominent at bases b/l Cardiac: Distant sounds, RRR, nl S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: Soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Pertinent Results: CXR [**11-6**]: Since prior exam, there has been no significant interval change.
Persistent opacification at the left lung base may represent pneumonia or atelectasis.
There is no pneumothorax.
CT Head w/o contrast [**11-7**]: No acute intracranial pathology.
MRI/MRA head No evidence of metatstasis, masses, mass effect, or hemorrhage.
[**2115-11-7**] TTE The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-10-21**], there is worsening in right ventricular function with more right ventricular dilation, increased severity of tricuspid regurgitation, and increased estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
[**2115-11-15**] UGI Series Free passage of the thin barium into the stomach without evidence of obstruction or severe stricture or gross mass.
[**2115-11-23**] CTA No central or segmental pulmonary embolism, however, subsegmental pulmonary emboli cannot be excluded given the extent of atelectasis/collapse of the lower lobes.
Interval increase in the size of the cavitating left upper lobe neoplasm with new bilateral lung lesions consistent with disease progression.
There is no appreciable change since the prior study.
There are multifocal opacities in left upper lobe as well as bilateral lower lobes.
The left upper lobe lesion is a known cavitary malignancy.
IMPRESSION:  No appreciable change since prior study.
INR: 2.8   Brief Hospital Course: 85 y/o male with a h/o COPD on 6L home O2 (FEV1 28% predicted), recurrent DVT on coumadin, and recently diagnosed LUL NSCLC who was admitted with hypotension, new AF, and ARF.
The patient was initially admitted to the intensive care unit for hypotension, which was thought due to a combination of dehydration and adrenal insufficiency (patient had finished a steroid taper the day before).
He then developed hypoxia worsening about [**11-16**] and had another brief few days in the intensive care unit on stress dose steroids for respiratory monitoring before he was transferred back to the oncology floor.
He has remained afebrile and feeling well on the floor except for two episodes of obtundation due to the combination of steroids, trazodone and ambien.
Dysphagia Pt had issues with pain on swallowing and a "feeling of food getting stuck in chest/epigastrium" ongoing for several weeks which seemed to worsene over the admission.
A barium swallow was performed and there was no evidence of stricture or obstruction.
He had evidence of thrush in his mouth and he was empirically treated with a course of fluconazole for presumed [**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis, especially in view of his recent intake of high dose steroids.
Speech and swallow evaluated the patient and he had no issues with swallowing and was deemed not an aspiration risk.
Newly diagnosed NSCLC The patient was diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer on [**9-/2115**] per cytology.
He wlll follow up after discharge for his CyberKnife therapy.
CTA performed on [**11-23**] to assess for pulmonary embolism showed some questionably new lesions on the R lung.
Atrial fibrillation During the patient's admission for hypotension, he was also found to be in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate.
He is also anticoagulated for his h/o recurrent DVT and atrial fibrillation.
Thrush The patient was treated for thrush and presumed [**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis with a course of fluconazole x 7 days, course completed.
Neurology followed the patient from the beginning for a history of left sided weakness and found no acute issues.
His weakness was thought due to neuropathy, deconditioning and poor PO intake.
COPD/hypoxia The patient has a h/o severe COPD with FEV1 28% predicted and on home O2 (6 liters).
He did have episodes of hypoxia which was attributed to his NSCLC and severe COPD.
He was treated with high dose steroids during this admission for COPD exacerbation and he will be maintained on 10 mg of prednisone daily upon discharge, according to the recommendations of pulmonary consult.
A CTA was performed which showed no pulmonary embolism.
He has had two ICU stays, one for hypoxia and one for hypotension.
DVT The patient has a known h/o DVT on coumadin prior to admission.
Hypotension, resolved This was likely due to volume depletion and atrial fibrillation resulting in loss of atrial kick.
Relative adrenal insufficiency is also high on the differential given recent discontinuation of prednisone.
Sepsis less likely; patient was afebrile, leukocytosis was at baseline (patient on steroids).
PE less likely given absence of tachycardia, change in oxygen requirement, or pleuritic chest pain, although patient has history of DVT.
ACS less likely given lack of acute ST-T changes on EKG and negative CE.
The patient became acutely obtunded and agitated when sleeping pills were used.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for electrode placement and you were found to have low blood pressure and left-sided weakness.
Neurology saw you and did not think that you had a stroke.
You also had some shortness of breath.
While on the floor, you can another episode of difficulty breathing and were transferred again to the intensive care unit.
