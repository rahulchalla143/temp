A large amount of ascites in the abdomen and pelvis, as before.
There is increased enhancement of the margins of fluid in both flanks with areas of loculation.
New area of enhancing perihepatic fluid adjacent to the lateral margin of the right hepatic lobe, which may represent a biloma following prior cholecystostomy.
The cholecystostomy tube now lies in the right anterior abdominal wall, with a small portion in the subcapsular portion of the right hepatic lobe.
No PE is seen.
Large bilateral pleural effusions have slightly increased in size.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 27 yo male who was admitted from outside hospital ICU initially admitted on [**4-22**] and transferred to our [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] MICU on [**2162-4-29**] with alcoholic necrotizing pancreatitis and ARDS.
He was extubated twice once in outside hospital and once in the our ICU he became tachypenic and was unable to protect his airway, so he was reintubated.
#Pancreatitis: He developed necrotizing pancreatitis complicated with ARDS.
He had diffuse abdominal inflammation and ascites thought to be due to his pancreatitis.
# Pulmomary Embolus: Pt was diagnosed with PE on CT scan which showed probable PE versus motion artifact:  LENIs were negative.
# Bacteremia:  Pt had Vanco Resistent Eneteroccocus from [**5-12**] culture, antibiotic switched from Vanco to linezolid started on [**5-13**] with a 14 day course (to be completed by [**5-27**].).
He had fevers much of his stay which eventually trended down with antibiotics.
On discharge, he was asymptommatic, afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
#C. Diff: pt had positive C. diff toxin from outside hospital.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Pt likely developed ARDS in the setting of pancreatitis.
Pt was treated with 14 day course of [**Last Name (un) 2830**] and Vanco and 8 day course of levo for aspiration/HAP pna.
#Delerium and sedation: Pt experienced delerium thought to be secondary to his high doses of narcotics and benzos for sedation while intubated for 30 days.
We ultimately put him on beta blockers Carvedilol 6.25 [**Hospital1 **] to rate control him and prevent tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy.
Warfarin 5 mg Tablet [**Year (4 digits) **]: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily):   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Necrotizing pancreatitis ARDS - Acute Respiritary Failure Pneumonia Vancomycin resistent enterococcus bacteremia Pulmonary embolism Clostridium Difficile diarrhea Tachycardia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You will go to a rehab center to continue your care for alcoholic pancreatitis and respiratory failure.
You were admitted to the hospital for over a month for treatment of alcoholic pancreatitis and respiratory failure.
We gave you antibiotics for infections of your blood and abdomen which must be continued after discharge as listed below.
It is important that you have your warfarin level checked as instructed by your physician once you leave rehab.
