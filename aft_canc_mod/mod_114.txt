Slight increase in vague opacities involving the mid-to-lower lungs are increased from the prior radiograph and could reflect underpenetration and poor technique, though the possibility of pneumonia is difficult to exclude.
Suture material in the right perihilar region is unchanged.
No large pleural effusion is seen.
No pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Limited study with subtle increased opacity involving the mid-to-lower lungs bilaterally, may reflect pneumonia.
Consider more optimized technique with dedicated PA and lateral views to more clearly and thoroughly assess.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%) with possible mild inferolateral hypokinesis.
Cannot exclude other focal wall motion abnormality due to suboptimal views.
There is probably severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2); estimation limited by suboptimal left ventricular outflow tract Doppler recordings and uncertainty in measurement of the left ventricular outflow tract diameter.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen but may be underestimated.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 5066**] is an 84 year old man with history of COPD, dCHF, AF, Aortic Stenosis valve area 0.7, s/p superior segmentectomy of right lower lobe [**12/2158**], transfered from OSH with very mild troponin elevation, transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac evaluation, admitted to the MICU with pneumonia and heart failure.
# Community Acquired Pneumonia Patient was noted to have RML and retrocardiac opacities on CXR.
# Acute on Chronic dCHF: Baseline weight of 214 lbs per son.
[**Name (NI) **] was felt to be in acute on chronic heart failure in the MICU where he was given IV lasix as needed for diuresis.
Patient was discharged on furosemide 40mg every Other day in setting of elevated bicarbonate and limited fluid buildup after two days of holding diuretics, felt to have contraction alkalosis.
# COPD Exacerbation Patient was treated 5 day predisone burst.
# Troponin elevation: Very mild troponin elevation to 0.08 at OSH, normalized on admission, likely secondary to demand ischemia.
No EKG changes to suggest active ischemia.
Most likely became hypovolemic, possible with poor foward flow in setting of AS, and had demand episode.
# Delirium: Patient with episodes of delirium overnight during hospitalization, likely in setting of infection and ICU stay, improved by time of discharge.
# Acute grieving/depression: Patient recovering from recent loss of wife ([**2159-7-14**]).
# Hypothyroidism TSH elevated to 21 with low Free T4 0.04.
Hypothyroidism may contribute to functional decline over last couple of months and depressive symptoms.
# Acute renal insufficiency Discharged with creatinine of 1.2.
# Atrial fibrillation Currently in NSR.
Initially held coumadin because of elevated INR, then restarted.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Community Acquired Pneumonia Acute on Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure Severe Aortic Stenosis  Secondary Diagnoses: Atrial Fibrillation Delirium   Discharge Condition: Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane).
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Because of your heart failure, please weigh yourself every morning and call the doctor if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs and please do not eat more than 2grams of total daily salt per day.
