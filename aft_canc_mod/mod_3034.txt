The patient underwent a recent RFA of hepatocellular carcinoma in [**2184-12-7**] and [**2185-2-6**].
The patient had end stage liver disease.
The patient also has a history of esophageal varices, status post endoscopy that showed grade I varices in [**2183-6-7**].
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No chest pain, no shortness of breath, no fevers, chills, no dysuria.
History of perforated duodenal ulcer.
Status post AESCULAP, gram patch and primary closure of perforated duodenal ulcer in [**2184-7-7**].
Abdomen was soft, nondistended, tender to palpation over the right upper quadrant, well-healed midline scar.
Chest x-ray showed no acute coronary or pulmonary process.
Echo showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55% with mild left ventricular dilatation and stress test showed no ischemic changes.
The patient had PFT's that showed mild obstructive defect.
Patient had an orthotopic donor after cardiac death liver transplantation with portal vein to portal vein anastomosis and iliac artery conduit from repaired celiac artery and common bile duct to common bile duct anastomosis and repair of a small bowel enterotomy and repair of duodenal enterotomy.
The patient was put on pressor support with fluid resuscitation for low blood pressure.
Patient had adequate urinary output and patient was on broad spectrum antibiotics for perioperative purposes.
On postoperative day number 2, the patient continued to have high LFTs with abnormal coags.
Despite support, we had difficulty ventilating the patient.
The liver biopsy showed a 70% cellular necrosis, consistent with rejection.
The patient underwent plasmapheresis for a period of time, for a potential ABO mismatch liver.
On postoperative day number 8 and 4, however, the patient had worsening respiratory distress with inability to ventilate the patient.
On postoperative day number 9 and 5, the patient had significant worsening ventilatory effort.
The patient had increasing heart rate and became profoundly neutropenic.
The patient remained afebrile but tachycardiac, requiring increasing amounts of Levophed and Vasopressin.
The chest x-ray showed patchy infiltrates.
However, during the course of the day, the patient had worsening cardiac physiology consistent with septic physiology.
The patient required increasing amount of pressors, increasing amounts of fluids and despite both full pressor support and fluids, the patient was difficult to maintain patient's pressures.
With addition of fluid, the patient was unable to ventilate and oxygenate and had difficulty maintaining his respiratory status.
Hepatitis C cirrhosis, status post liver transplantation     x2.
Esophageal varices.
Hepatitis C cirrhosis, status post RFA.
