Admission Date:  [**2144-9-9**]       Discharge Date:  [**2144-9-16**]  Date of Birth:   [**2089-9-20**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54-year-old male with known coronary artery disease who was admitted to [**Hospital6 2910**] on [**2144-9-9**], for elective cardiac catheterization.
Past medical history is significant for coronary artery disease status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with stent of the left anterior descending coronary artery in [**2138**].
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital6 2910**], the patient reported constant four out of ten chest pain with radiation to his jaw since the previous evening, [**2144-9-8**].
The patient continued to have chest pain status post catheterization with no electrocardiogram changes evident.
This resulted in a decrease in his chest pain to one to two out of ten in severity.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for therapeutic catheterization.
Prior to catheterization at [**Hospital1 69**], patient received fentanyl 25 mcg for his discomfort and Versed.
Therapeutic catheterization at [**Hospital1 190**] showed left main coronary artery disease with mid ostial disease, left anterior descending with 60% ostial lesion, moderate 50% mid disease prior to stent, 95% tight focal lesion in old stent prior to first major diagonal branch.
Status post catheterization, the patient had serosanguinous blood discharge and ooze from around sheaths upon arrival to the floor.
The patient complained of recurrent pain so additional doses of morphine were given.
As the hematoma and groin continued to ooze bloody discharge, a vascular groin C-clamp was applied.
Upon arrival to the CCU, he complained of severe pain, greater than ten out of ten in severity.
Coronary artery disease status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent to left anterior descending artery in [**2138**].
Chronic back pain status post multiple surgeries (times eight).
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma status post chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
Prostate cancer status post radical prostatectomy.
Status post right salivary gland removal.
ALLERGIES:  Patient with no known drug allergies.
Neck:  Supple, no masses or lymphadenopathy.
No jugular venous distention.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen:  Soft, mildly tender diffusely, non-distended.
Groin: Right femoral area with large tense hematoma, markedly expanding, very tender to palpation.
No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Dipyridamole EKG ([**2144-8-25**]):  Normal sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, incomplete right bundle branch block, left anterior hemiblock but inconclusive dipyridamole exercise EKG.
No chest pain or diagnostic ST segment changes to heart rate of 101.
Anterior wall thinning consistent with prior non-transmural myocardial infarction.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Poor R-wave progression.
CORONARY CATHETERIZATION ([**2144-9-9**]):  Demonstrated selective left-sided coronary angiography in this left dominant circulation demonstrated one vessel coronary artery disease.
The left main coronary artery had a 30% ostial lesion.
The left anterior descending had serial lesions, with a tubular 60% proximal, 50% mid prior to the old stent, mild in-stent re-stenosis leading into a 95% lesion at the distal end of the stent.
The left circumflex had mild luminal irregularity and gave off an OM1 with moderate diffuse disease.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (three) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There is no 2-D echocardiographic findings of tamponade, but a complete Doppler assessment was not possible.
Duplex evaluation performed of the right lower extremity arterial and venous systems with concentration on the inguinal region.
Impression was that of a large right groin hematoma.
There was no evidence of obvious pseudo-aneurysm or arteriovenous fistula.
REPEAT RIGHT VASCULAR ULTRASOUND OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY ([**2144-9-4**]):  Again, there was a large right femoral hematoma which demonstrates heterogeneous echotexture.
There is no evidence of pseudo-aneurysm or arteriovenous fistula formation.
Coronary artery disease:  Patient with known history of coronary artery disease status post coronary catheterization times two on [**2144-9-9**], status post stent placement in the proximal/mid left anterior descending artery.
Initially many of the patient's antihypertensive medications including Catapres and Accupril were held secondary to the questionable hemodynamic instability resulting from his right groin hematoma and blood loss anemia.
After stabilization of his intravascular volume status post multiple transfusions, and several days of monitoring, the patient was restarted on metoprolol and captopril.
After several days of monitoring, the patient continued to be hypertensive with blood pressures ranging 160 to 180 over 90's to 100.
The patient continued to be monitored on telemetry with no evidence of acute conduction abnormalities.
After the complaint of chest pain on the first day of admission with no demonstrable electrocardiographic changes, the patient remained chest pain free for the remainder of this admission.
Right groin hematoma resulting in blood loss anemia: Vascular Surgery consultation was obtained status post coronary catheterization and development of large right groin hematoma.
Vascular Surgery recommended a lower extremity ultrasound with results as above, namely, ultrasound demonstrated a large right groin hematoma, no evidence of pseudo-aneurysm or arteriovenous fistula formation.
Due to anemia secondary to blood loss, the patient required multiple blood transfusions for stabilization of his blood volume and maintenance of hematocrit greater than 30.
His pain was treated with morphine, fentanyl and Versed initially.
Repeat ultrasound was obtained on [**2144-9-4**], with no evidence of hematoma expansion, no evidence of pseudo-aneurysm or arteriovenous fistula formation.
As the patient's hematoma resolved within a prolonged period of immobilization, it was felt that discharge to a rehabilitation facility where he could work on functional mobility and increasing gait and balance was warranted.

q. day as needed for constipation.
FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  Patient is being discharged to a rehabilitation program for gait, stair, transfer training with goal of increased functional mobility.
