EKG demonstrated NSR at 80, rSr', no significant ST/T wave changes from prior.
CXR at the time demonstrated increased bilateral opacities, worse since [**2184-8-15**].
He was originally admitted on [**2184-8-11**] as a transfer from OSH with recurrence of disease.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course has been complicated by tumor lysis syndrome which has been treated with aggressive IV fluids.
On [**8-13**], he experienced onset of new AF with RVR.
Metoprolol was gradually uptitrated but he experienced increasing dyspnea.
A chest CT was done, which demonstrated multifocal bilateral upper lobe, RML, and superior segment LLL ground glass opacities with diffuse peribronchial thickening.
There was also interlobular septal thickening at the right base, and small bilateral effusions with ddx including pulmonary edema, DAH, and infection.
On the evening of [**8-14**], Mr. [**Known lastname 5395**] continued to be tachycardic to 140s in AF despite up-titration of metoprolol to 100mg PO.
He was noted to have crackles and elevated JVP on exam, and was experiencing gradually worsening dyspnea.
At that time, he was diuresed with 20 mg IV lasix and sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where bronchoscopy demonstrated previous pulmonary hemorrhage but no active bleeding.

There is no abnormal enhancement of the visualized cranial nerves.
Meckel's caves and cavernous sinuses appear normal.
There are no areas of slow diffusion.
There are a few scattered T2 hyperintense foci of the subcortical and deep white matter, which may represent small vessel ischemic changes.
There is decreased T1 signal of the visualized bone marrow of the calvarium and cervical spine which is a nonspecific finding but may represent involvement by lymphoma or marrow reconversion.
There appears to be a left medial orbital wall blowout fracture.
IMPRESSION: No abnormal enhancement of the visualized cranial nerves.
[**8-14**] CXR: Progression of bilateral airspace and interstitial opacities, at least a component of which likely represents hydrostatic edema given associated cardiovascular changes.
Coexisting infection, hemorrhage or drug reaction is also possible in the setting of lymphoma.
Multifocal ground-glass opacities involving the both upper lobes, right middle lobe and superior segment of left lower lobe measuring up to 3.7 cm, with diffuse peribronchial thickening and pleural effusion and mediastinal and paraaortic nodes as described above.
Differential diagnosis include alveolar hemorrhage in the presence of hemoptysis, infectious process in the appropriate clinical setting, with etiology including both viral and bacteria, or atypical multifocal pulmonary edema given rapid appearance and septal thickening and effusion.
Diffuse high density of the liver, could represent hemosiderosis or hemachromatosis, or amiodarone accumulation.
Bilateral nonobstructing renal stones.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
ECG: NSR at 80s, normal axis, normal intervals, rSr' in V1, no significant ST-T wave changes compared to two prior EKGS (however both prior in a fib) .
[**2184-8-30**] CT CHEST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 55 year old man with Large B-cell Lymphoma REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: re-eval s/p chemo r/o infection CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: Had ARF  INDICATION: 55-year-old man with large B-cell lymphoma.
Images were obtained with 1.25 mm slice thickness and displayed in soft tissue and lung windows.
Moderate calcifications line the aortic arch in all three coronary vessels, particularly the left circumflex.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Bilateral pleural effusions have resolved.
Multifocal areas of ground-glass opacities seen on the prior CT have largely resolved.
New ground-glass opacities, mainly in the anterior aspects of both upper lobes and right mid lobe are new, but appear less dense than those seen previously.
Multiple pulmonary nodules measuring no more than 2 mm in size, and are difficult to differentiate from the underlying lung disease.
Calcified granulomas in the right lower lobe (3/36, 3/41) are consistent with prior granulomatous infection.
There is an exophytic simple cyst from the interpolar left kidney measuring up to 3.2 x 2.6 cm in size.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no findings concerning for malignancy within the imaged bones.
Marked interval improvement in multifocal ground-glass opacities, predominating in the upper lobes.
New foci of ground-glass opacity in the anterior segments of both upper lobes and right middle lobe are less dense than those seen previously.
Resolved bilateral pleural effusions.
Decrease in mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Mild splenomegaly.
Unchanged nonobstructing bilateral renal stones.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened (focal thickening of the non-coronary cusp) but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-8-13**], the patient is no longer tachycardic.
Trace aortic regurgitation was present on the prior study (but not reported).
New small pleural effusions and diffuse smoothly thickenied septal lines, most compatible with hydrostatic edema.
Increased conspicuity of diffuse centrilobular nodules, but overall decrease in size in majority of the previously-visualized ground-glass opacities, some of which are now consolidative.
Mr. [**Known lastname 5395**] is a 55 yo male with NHL recently admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hemoptysis in setting of thrombocytopenia and dyspnea secondary to A. Fib with RVR,  re-admitted for increasing dyspnea likely secondary to pulmonary edema.
LYMPHOMA: The patient had had chemo prior to admission and suffered from tumor lysis syndrome.
The patient's heme malignancy was  diagnosed as BURKITTs LYMPHOMA during this admission, accounting for aggressive tumor turnover.
He tolerated the chemo well, but required close monitoring of his volume status (diastolic HF) and his oxygenation, as well as tumor lysis status.
He did not receive Part B of HyperCVAD as patient had moderate sized R sided pleural effusions.
He once again became neutropenic and his counts had not yet recovered by the time patient was transferred.
Etiology of SOB was initially not clear, but includes pulmonary edema, pneumonia (aspergillus), PE, and MI, DAH.
Pulmonary edema seemed most likely as oxygen saturation improved with lasix.
Patient had BAL positive for aspergillus, but was on voriconazole at the time of his hypoxia, and this would be unlikely to cause acute SOB.
CXR  showed bilateral infiltrates.
There was no suspicion for PE, and it would be difficult to anticoagulate patient at that time due to recent hemoptysis and low platelets.
EKG showed no ischemic changes and enzymes were negative.
The patient's respiratory status improved with an increase in his daily dose of lasix, and he remained asymptomatic once transferred to the floor, on no oxygen.
His peripheral edema was resolving slowly on his increased dose of lasix.
The patient was initially in A Fib with RVR, which resolved with monitoring of his volume status and increased beta blocker.
No anticoagulation was indicated in view of his low platelets and history of bleeding (hemoptysis).
Patient had recent hemoptysis and was found to have a clot in the carina on bronchoscopy a few days prior.
The patient developed ARF initially in the setting of tumor lysis syndrome.
Creatinine improved on lanthanum and aluminum hydroxide with resolution of the syndrome and close monitoring of fluid balance.
Workup included BAL that was positive for aspergillus.
After treatment with IVAC, patient again developed neutropenic fever.
Therefore patient was started on flagyl and three stool samples had been sent for C. difficile toxin.
One day prior to transfer, patient complained of painful hematuria.
He has a history of kidney stones and attributed his symptoms to this.
Patient denied further hematuria, frequency or dysuria.
Pain resolved with passage of bloody urine.
Would need further evaluation for hemorrhagic cystitis vs. BK virus vs nephrolithiasis.
Levalbuterol HCl 0.63 mg/3 mL Solution Sig: One (1) ML Inhalation Q4 prn () as needed for SOB, wheezing.
DiphenhydrAMINE 12.5 mg IV BEFORE VANCO ADMINISTRATION   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Burkitts Lymphoma Diastolic Heart Failure Neutropenic Fever Pneumonia Pulmonary Edema   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Admitted with a lymphoma which extensive testing proved to be BURKITTS.
You had a lung infection and also fluid in your lungs which necessitated management in the ICU.
Your medications have been adjusted to better deal with this and also your leg edema (swelling).
