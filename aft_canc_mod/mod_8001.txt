Subsequently she developed atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response and was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service.
# Adenoma w/ atypia Patient underwent right laproscopic ileocolectomy for adenoma that was not amenable to resection via colonoscopy.
# Atrial fibrillation / Flutter Patient has known hx of aflutter / fibrillation.
# Troponin Elevation In the setting of aflutter w/ RVR her CE's were checked.
In the setting of somewhat decreased GFR, the trop elevation was considered secondary to demand ischemia.
She was chest pain free during the episodes and EKG showed aflutter w/o ekg changes.
# COPD Patient experienced baseline SOB, worse w/ ambulation.
# Anemia: most likely anemia of chronic disease, no source of bleed, and HCT stable with normal B12/folate and iron.
