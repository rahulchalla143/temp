Large infiltrative mass arising from the lesser curvature of the stomach, with possible invasion of the left hepatic lobe and pancreas - findings are consistent with extensive gastric malignancy.
There is also omental caking and intra- abdominal fluid consistent with intraperitoneal metastases.
Multiple large gallstones within a non-distended gallbladder.
Prominence of the CBD with mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, without definite distal CBD obstruction.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
[**8-17**] Pathology: Stomach mass biopsy: 1.

Special stains (PAS-D and mucicarmine) of the tumor cells are faintly positive for mucin.
Chronic mildly active inflammation of the adjacent mucosa.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 79 year-old female with a history of HTN, embolic CVA on coumadin, hypothyroidism who presented with weakness, palpitations, orthostasis and unintentional weight loss found to have +guaiac stools  and HCT of 17 in ED.
Patient with very low hematocrit, elevated INR of 2.5 on admission and blood in her stool raised initial concern of active GI bleeding, possibly due to undiagnosed malignancy.
The patient was transfused 4 units PRBC in ICU and underwent upper endoscopy revealing large gastric adenocarcinoma with CT revealing evidence of likely metastatic spread to left hepatic lobe, pancreas and omental caking.
# Metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma) The patient was seen by the GI, oncology, radiation oncology and palliative care services.
She did not want IR embolization if she had a rapid GI bleed.
# Anemia of acute blood loss)  Stable after PRBC transfusions.
Likely initially secondary to hypotension and orthostasis given poor PO intake.
Unlikely to be hyperthyroid given elevated TSH.
INR 2.5 on admission which is within goal range, however in setting of significant GI bleed from her gastric cancer permanently discontinued her coumadin and aspirin.
# Hyperlipidemia:  - continue home statin  .
TSH 7 which is slightly elevated.
appears that patient on 100 of levothroxyine at home 6 times a week, will change to daily in the setting of elevated TSH, would also consider uptitration of medication -cont  levothyroxine as above   Medications on Admission: Coumadin  5 mg qd  except 2.5 mg on Sunday atenolol 50mg PO qd HCTZ 25mg po qd atorvastatin 40mg PO qd levothyroxine 100mcg PO 1tab qd 6d/week ASA 81mg PO qd folic acid .4mg PO qd cyanocobalamin 1,000mcg/ml sln, 1cc every other mo.
