Admission Date:  [**2145-6-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2145-6-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2105-1-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Naprosyn / Iodine / Adhesive Tape  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1854**] Chief Complaint: Headache, confusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: craniotomy for tumor resection  History of Present Illness: 40 yo female with hx metastatic melanoma (dx [**2136**]) with multiple recurrences (LNs, lungs, bowel) complains of 1 week of dull headaches with a few days of confusion and difficulty concentrating.
Denies nausea/vomiting, seizures, weakness, numbness, paresthesias, problems with vision or balance.
Recurrence in R groin, treated with radiation, recurrence in lung, treated with IL-2, recurrence in colon, partial colectomy.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Reflexes: B T Br Pa Ac Right     2 2 2  2  2 Left      2 2 2  2  2  Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements, heel to shin   Pertinent Results: MRI Head [**2145-6-24**]: FINDINGS: In the left frontal lobe (13:18) is a 3 x 2.3 cm heterogeneously enhancing mass which is broad base along the dura.
There is significant high FLAIR signal around this mass extending throughout the frontal lobe and into the anterior aspect of the left parietal lobe.
There is mass effect from the heterogeneously enhancing mass as well as the edema causing approximately 6 mm of rightward shift of normally midline structures, but no evidence for subfalcine, transtentorial or uncal herniation.
There are no other enhancing masses identified.
There is no evidence for acute territorial infarction.
There is an anomalous venous drainage arising in the right parietal lobe (10:59) which is unchanged from prior examination.
There is decreased T1 marrow signal.
Dural based left frontal heterogeneously enhancing mass with surrounding edema causing minimal rightward shift of midline but no herniation.
Given patient's history of melanoma this is concerning for a metastatic lesion.
There are no other lesions concerning for metastatic disease identified.
Low T1 signal in the bone marrow may represent marrow hyperplasia secondary to known malignancy or its treatment, unchanged.
Expected post-surgical changes including pneumocephalus is identified.
There is a moderate amount of edema in the left frontal lobe causing adjacent mass effect.
There is no significant amount of postoperative intracranial hemorrhage identified.
Small amount of hyperdense material layering along the surgical margin is identified and is expected.
There is a 2 mm rightward shift of normally midline structures.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus.
Expected post-surgical changes with pneumocephalus and moderate amount of left frontal lobe edema causing mass effect and minimal rightward shift of normally midline structures.
No significant amount of post-surgical intracranial hemorrhage.
MRI Head [**2145-6-26**]: FINDINGS: Since the previous MRI, the patient has undergone resection of left frontal dural-based mass which are suspicious for metastatic lesion.
Blood products are seen at the surgical site with evidence of air and extensive left frontal lobe edema as before.
There is mild pachymeningeal enhancement seen following gadolinium.
Mild enhancement is also seen surrounding the area of blood products which is suspicious for mild residual enhancement.
There is no hydrocephalus seen.
No acute infarct identified.
IMPRESSION: Status post resection of left frontal mass with blood products and air at the surgical site with mild residual enhancement adjacent to the blood products at the surgical bed.
Surrounding edema is identified.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the ICU for Q 1 hour neuro checks due to a large new brain mass with significant edema.
Her pain was well-controlled and she was neurologically stable.
The patient was voiding on her own and able to take in food without difficulty.
On discharge her incision was clean and dry, her exam was neurologically intact, she was voiding without difficulty.
-Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
-Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
-Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
-You have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
CALL YOUR SURGEON IMMEDIATELY IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY OF THE FOLLOWING  -New onset of tremors or seizures.
-Any confusion or change in mental status.
-Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
-Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
-Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
F.   Followup Instructions: Follow-up for suture/staple removal in [**6-25**] days from the date of your surgery and a wound check.
