He had ongoing dyspnea and some mild confusion and he remained in the hospital until [**10-9**] for more diuresis and for nutritional and physical optimization.
He had been taking percocet for pain and this was discontinued with a near resolution of his complaint of not being mentally alert.
He had a V/Q scan to rule-out a pleural embolus which was negative.
His glypizide was discontinued as he had slightly rising LFTs and we wanted to ensure that he wasn't having hepatotoxicity from this medication.
He was doing well, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, with good pain control, and decreased dyspnea.
