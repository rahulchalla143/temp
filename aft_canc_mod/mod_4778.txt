Admission Date:  [**2150-12-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2150-12-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2084-12-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11839**] Chief Complaint: Cord compression, esophageal cancer.
[**2150-12-17**]: IVC filter placement.
History of Present Illness: This is a 66 year old male with PMH significant for squamous cell esophageal cancer diagnosed in [**2149**], s/p 3 cycles of cisplatin and 5FU and XRT, history of radiation pneumonitis, history of SVT s/p ablation, who is transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital due to concern for cord compression and urgent neurosurgical evaluation.
Patient was admitted to OSH on [**2150-12-7**] due to acute abdominal pain and found to have a partial bowel obstruction.
He improved with conservative therapy.
However, on the morning of [**2150-12-9**], patient found to have inability to move his legs or feet.
Prior to his transfer, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of neurosurgery was consulted, who believed that the chance for a neurologic recovery was very low given the period between onset of symptoms and transfer for evaluation.
His prior workup is notable for history of persistent tachycardia with heart rates in the 150s, with two prior CTAs (one on [**2150-11-24**] and one on [**2150-12-4**]) both of which were negative for PE.
Patient was directly admitted to the floor, but triggered upon arrival due to HR in the 150s, which initially was sinus tachycardia, but which quickly escalated to 210s with stable blood pressures and oxygen saturations, with telemetry findings consistent with SVT.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied cough, shortness of breath.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
Past Medical History: - squamous cell esophageal cancer: diagnosed in [**2149**] by EGD with presence of bulky mediastinal adenopathy involving the upper mediastinum; s/p 3 cycles of cisplatin and 5FU and XRT then two more cycles of chemo - history of radiation pneumonitis - intermittent dysphagia - history of supraventricular tachycardia s/p ablation - compression of spinal cord level T6 secondary to fracture of his T6 vertebral body - history of radiation pneumonitis treated with solumedrol - subacute T6 compression fracture - s/p right nephrectomy - cholelithiasis  Social History: Married, lives with wife and son.
Family History: No history of esophageal or renal cancer.
General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Decreased breath sounds in the bases, no wheezes or rales.
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: A+O X 3.
Decreased rectal tone.
No spinal anesthesia.
Absent patellar reflexes bilaterally.
Pertinent Results: OSH CT abdomen/pelvis [**2150-12-6**]: Findings raise concern for a mid small bowel early or partial obstruction, exact site uncertain.
Distal esophageal changes, consistent with previous clinical diagnosis of esophageal carcinoma.
Pleural effusions.
OSH CT head [**2150-12-7**]: There is a 1cm enhancing mass at the grey-white matter junction of the posterior left frontal lobe, with some associated edema but no significant mass effect.
There is significant retropulsion of bone fragments into the spinal canal at this level which reduces the diameter of the spinal canal by approximately 50%.
Although soft tissue resolution in the spinal canal is limited, suspect that soft tissue material is suspicious for tumor extending from the compressed vertebra into the spinal canal.
Moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions.
OSH CT lumbar spine [**2150-12-9**]: Moderate compression of L2, L4, L5, appearance of osteoporotic compression fractures.
Moderate acquired spinal stenosis at the L3-L4 and L4-L5 levels.
T6: Severe compression fracture, with areas of increased signal intensity on the STIR sequence, likely related to edema.
Retropulsion of the posterior aspect of the vertebral body into the spinal canal resulting in severe spinal canal stenosis and moderate degree of compression on the spinal cord at this level.
Pre- and paravertebral and epidural component noted.
Pathologic compression fracture likely, with involvement by tumor.
L2: Moderate degree of loss of height of the L2 with areas of marrow edema.
Possible prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
Post-contrast images can be helpful to assess for tumor at this level.
Correlation with bone sca/PET can be considered to assess for neoplastic etiology.
Multilevel degenerative changes, multifactorial in the lumbar spine with moderate-to-severe canal stenosis at L4-5 level, crowding of the roots of the cauda equina.
Edema in the cord in the thoracic spine from T4-T8 levels.
Increased signal intensity in the posterior spinous soft tissues in the mid thoracic spine, question trauma/dependent edema.
Bilateral pleural effusions, left more than right.
No pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, increased from the comparison study.
Collapse of the T6 vertebral body with resultant severe narrowing of the central spinal canal.
Thickening of esophagus and para-esophageal lymphadenopathy concordant with history of esophageal cancer.
Mass with intrinsic susceptibility artifact within the left insular subcortical white matter with adjacent edema.
This could represent an aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm, as an M2 branch extends into it.
However, a hemorrhagic metastasis (especially given history of renal cell carcinoma) is also possible, as is a small parenchymal hgematoma.
Moderate to severe intracranial atherosclerosis.
[**2150-12-11**] C Spine MRI IMPRESSION: No evidence of cervical metastases on this examination on this limited, incompete examination.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 year old man with metastatic squamous cell esophageal cancer diagnosed in [**2149**] s/p 3 cycles of cisplatin and 5FU and XRT, history of radiation pneumonitis, history of SVT s/p ablation admitted for cord compression and urgent neurosurgical evaluation with bilateral pleural effusions; his hospital course was complicated by MICU admission for bilateral widespread pulmonary emboli, pressor requirement, and intubation.
# Cord compression: The patient was transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) for urgent neurosurgical evaluation of new cord compression beginning on [**12-9**] from a known subacute compression fracture at T6 resulting in a dense, complete paraplegia and sensory loss of bilateral lower extremeties.
He was continued on Dexamethasone and evaluated by both radiation oncology and neurosurgical services.
He had been noted to regain minimal motor and sensory function of bilateral lower extremities.
#  Pulmonary emboli/admission to MICU for hemodynamic instability & Persistent left lower extremity DVT: The pt was transferred to the MICU on [**2150-12-16**] for hypotension, tachycardia, and multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli seen on CTA with extensive clot burden seen in the deep veins of his L leg.
He received an IVC filter [**2150-12-17**] for persistent extensive occlusive deep venous thrombosis of the left lower extremity involving the common femoral vein throughout the calf veins documented on [**2150-12-16**] bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds.
The etiology of his hypotension was thought to be sepsis (however, all BCx's this admission were negative) vs cardiogenic shock due to the pulmonary emboli.
By the time of call out from MICU, the pt was recorded as still being net positive approximately 4L.
# Respiratory failure: The pt was intubated for 5 days for respiratory failure after failing non-invasive ventilation.
Formal testing revealed significant cognitive deficits that call into question the patient's ability to make complex medical decisions.
# Dysphagia and aspiration risk: On [**2150-12-24**] formal speech and swallowing study showed the patient to be at risk to aspirate all food consistencies, but particularly thin liquids.
These findings and recommendations were reviewed with the patient and his wife (as health care proxy) on [**2150-12-25**], they chose to accept the risks of aspiration and chose the nectar/thick liquids/ ground solids diet.
The patient had a feeding tube during concurrent chemo/xrt for his esophageal cancer and adamantly does not want another feeding tube.
# Ground glass opacities seen on CTA: Could not rule out infectious process/aspiration PNA, so pt was started on Vanc/Cefepime, was eventually switched to Merrem, and by time of call out from MICU had completed an approximately 7 day course of antibiotics.
He does however have a persistent leukocytosis that was present since admission, peaked to 30, and was downtrending to 17 by time of MICU call out.
# Cardiac rhythm: While on the floor, pt noted to have narrow complex SVT's to the 200's which were intermittently treated with beta blockade.
This was also seen in the MICU, in addition to some runs of atrial fibrillation; this was also treated with intermittent beta blockade but pt was not kept on this by time of discharge from MICU.
# Unclear lesion in his brain: Per OMR notes and other reports, this is unclear but DDx was metastatic malignancy or aneurysm vs pseudoaneurysm.
# Superficial thrombophlebitis: Was noted to have asymmetric L > R UE swelling and had u/s showing LUE superficial clot, not extending to his deep venous system.
# Bilateral pleural effusions: The etiology of these are unclear (malignant vs parapneumonic vs transudative) but these were not tapped in the MICU.
# Metastatic esophageal cancer: The patient has been treated with 3 cycles of cisplatin and 5FU and XRT for esophageal cancer diagnosed in [**2149**] that is now metastatic to spine.
There has been a question of brain metastasis versus aneurysm, versus renal cell carcinoma recurrence and metastasis (from his prior nephrectomy).
Given pt's poor performance status and multiple co-morbidities pt not a candidate for palliative chemotherapy treatment and after discussions with wife and pt they decided to pursue hospice care.
# UTI: The patient had a urine culture positive for pansensitive klebsiella during his prior admission at the OSH.
# Small bowel obstruction: The patient initially presented to the OSH with symptoms c/w bowel obstruction.
# Anxiety and depression: The patient was continued on lorazepam and citalopram.

Discharge Instructions: You were transferred from an outside hospital with a cord compression of your thoracic spine.
You had surgery for your cord compression and steroids that improved your pain, but these only minimally improved the strength in your legs.
You then developed blood clots in your legs, which traveled to your lungs.
While in the hospital you were seen by the occupational health service on [**2150-12-24**], they have documented that you have severe cognitive deficits.
