Admission Date: [**2112-5-5**]        Discharge Date: [**2112-5-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-6-11**]        Sex:  F  Service:  OME   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer on Xeloda and Herceptin who presents with nausea and diarrhea.
As part treatment for this the patient started taking Imodium and noted a decreased frequency of diarrhea from four bowel movements a day to two bowel movements a day, but they were still liquidly in consistency.
She has also had increased dry heaves and crampy abdominal pain and is not even able to tolerate juice.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for chest pain, upper respiratory infection symptoms, dyspnea, dysuria, cough.
Metastatic breast cancer first diagnosed in [**2101**] status    post auto bone marrow transplant in [**2104**], metastatic to    bone, liver, and lungs, status post multiple cycles of    chemotherapy.
Anemia of chronic disease.
In general, she is in no acute distress but uncomfortable.
Her heart is tachycardiac and regular.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
As will be detailed below, the patient suffered a ventricular tachycardia arrest and was briefly in the Intensive Care Unit.
Patient was given a peripherally inserted central catheter line and started on TPN for parenteral nutrition.
Her diet was fully advanced from sips to clears, which she generally tolerated, although she had a few episodes of emesis towards the end of her stay.
Ventricular tachycardia arrest:  On the second day of    admission the patient was talking to the nurse and then    abruptly lost consciousness.
The patient had been on    telemetry due to abnormalities in the EKG and it was seen    on tele as being monomorphic or polymorphic ventricular    tachycardia leading to a VT arrest.
She was on telemetry for the duration of her admission, and there were no further telemetry events.
Moreover, while in the ICU she had an echocardiogram that was essentially negative for any structural disease.
She    would occasionally have an episode of nausea, but these    were generally self-limited and she was started on total    parenteral nutrition or additional nutrition while her gut    continues to recover.
The CT torso showed interval increase in    the size of a left hepatic lobe metastasis and diffuse    osseous metastatic disease.
In addition, the patient was    noted to have this questionable tracheal compression on a    chest film, so she had a CT trachea which showed widely    patent airways, more extensive osseous metastatic disease,    and pleural thickening in the right hemithorax likely also    looked metastatic disease.
Heme:  During her Intensive Care Unit stay her INR was as    high as 2.1 likely possible secondary to poor nutrition.
Metastatic breast cancer.
Ventricular tachycardia arrest.
Anemia of chronic disease.
