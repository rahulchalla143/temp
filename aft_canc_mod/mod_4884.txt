History of Present Illness: 85M with periampullary mass, associated jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia as well as 5lb unintentional weight loss presented to the [**Hospital1 **] GI unit after ERCP for palliative stenting/biopsy tissue diagnosis at which time duodenal obstruction was noted.
Past Medical History: Prostate cancer s/p prostatectomy  Social History: Married, lives with wife.
Family History: Father - prostate CA  Physical Exam: On Admission: VS: 95.0 83 140/71 15 992L GEN: AAO x2, obviously delirious CV: RRR, no m/r/g Lungs: CTAB Abd: rigid (partially from voluntary guarding), tender to the RUQ, +rebound tenderness - evidence of peritonitis Extr: 2+ distal pulses, no c/c/e .
[**2194-8-8**] EKG: Sinus arrhythmia with occasional ventricular premature beats.
Marked right atrial enlargment and prominent R waves in precordial leads.
ABD: IMPRESSION: Free air in the abdomen .
Periampullary mass with encasement of the gastroduodenal artery.
Distal pancreatic duct dilation.
Small peripancreatic lymphadenopathy.
No distant metastases seen.
Percutaneous cholecystostomy tube in place, without evidence of cholecystitis.
Pneumobilia is expect after patient's recent procedure.
Expected postoperative changes in right anterior abdominal wall.
Atrophic nodular kidneys which enhance and excrete contrast appropriately.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Bilateral atelectasis.
Right lower lobe mucous plugging.
Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram via left hepatic duct, demonstrating intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation, with a severe irregular stricture in the lower third of the common bile duct, compatible with known periampullary mass.
Filling defects within the common bile duct noted at the termination of the procedure, compatible with hemobilia.
[**2194-8-21**] Cholangiogram: Dilated central intrahepatic biliary ducts and proximal/mid CBD.
No contrast was seen to pass through the distal portion of the existing biliary catheter and into the duodenum.
Irregular narrowing of the common bile duct was again seen, consistent with the known periampullary mass.
Persistent dilatation of the central intrahepatic biliary ducts and proximal/mid CBD with irregular narrowing of the mid-to-distal CBD, consistent with the known ampullary mass.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was transferred from OSH into [**Hospital1 18**] with concerns for duodenal perforation s/p ERCP.
On [**2194-8-8**], the patient underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy, repair of duodenal perforation, open cholecystostomy tube placement and open gastrostomy, which went well without complication (please refer to the operative note for complete details).
Postoperatively, the patient was transferred into the SICU intubated, on IV fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter, and IV Dilaudid for pain control.
Neuro: The patient received Dilaudid IV with good effect and adequate pain control.
CV: The patient was found to have some ectopy on a preoperative ECG.
Pulmonary: Chest xray on admission revealed bilateral atelectasis.
Repeat CXR after the patient was extubated revealed decreased atelectasis.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
The Foley was removed on POD # 7, the patient subsequently voided without problem.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Wound care was done daily, no signs or symptoms of infection were noticed.
At the time of discharge to a rehab facility, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating clear liquid diet and TPN, ambulating with assist (walker), voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
