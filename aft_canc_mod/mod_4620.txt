The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 2025**] initially where he had a CTA of the chest done which was negative for PE however showed that there was only a 4mm opening of the trachea.
Syncope: The patient had syncope secondary to a vasovagal/possible hypoxemic episode after a coughing fit.
It is unlikely to be seizure as the patient states that he has had seizures in the past that presented differently.
He states that he had chest pain after the syncopal episode however he stated that this was secondary to CPR performed at parking office after his syncopal event.
Ishcemia is also unlikely given that he had a stress test done on prior admission which was negative for ischemia.
The diagnosis was confirmed when the patient had two additional syncopal episodes while in the presence of the interventional pulmonary fellows who agreed that the patient would need to be taken to the OR for stenting and debridment so the patient does not have any further episodes of syncope.
Cough: The patient had a cough which is likely secondary to the SCC of the larynx that the patient has.
However while the IP fellow was in the room, the patient had a coughing fit and syncopized.
He did not have any complications from his procedure.
Subsequently the patient developed some hemoptysis consisting of blood tinged sputum.
He was not complaining of shortness of breath or chest pain.
The patient also did not have any additional fevers after the low grade temp of 100.4.
