Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: paracentesis x 3 PICC line placement   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 916**] is a 63 yo, M, with hx of IgA deficiency, Crohn's disease, liver disease w/ nodular regenerative hyperplasia, COPD and hx of heavy smoking and ETOH consumption who was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2134-5-20**] w/ complaints of Severe Abdominal Pain, the patient describes that he felt a sudden onset severe abdominal pain, described as sharp and "like someone was twisting my intestine", [**11-9**] on pain scale, he describes it as generalized abdominal pain w/ no radiation to the back or any other areas, denies precipating factors and the pain was exacerbated by movement.
The pain was accompanied by nausea, SOB and mild fever, he denies diarrhea or constipation, denies melena, bloody stools, denies change in urinary habits, denies other associated sxs.
The pain was constant and he refers he never had this pain in the past.
He called 911 and was brought to the ED were he was found to have Ascities and an abdominal tap was performed.
The patient has had multiple admissions in the past 6 months, he reports that he noticed his ascities in [**Month (only) **]/[**2133-12-1**] and that he has been feeling SOB.
His last admission was about 2 weeks ago when he came to the hospital complaining of Fever, Abdominal distention and what seems to be an episode of Hematequeczia.
He underwent #2 Abdominal taps in the past month, the first one was perfomed on [**2134-5-10**] and was reported positive for Malignancy.
He was admitted to the floor transiently and then became hypotensive and transfered to the SICU for ?strangulated hernia, subsequently found to be reductible w/out obstruction on CT/US.

Low lung volumes.
There is left basilar atelectasis.
Again demonstrated is an ill-defined peripheral opacity in the right peripheral lower lung zone, with a small amount of lung herniating between the ribs better demonstrated on the prior CT.
However, there is a new focal area of consolidation in the right lower lobe medially, which is concerning for new pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: 1) New consolidation in the medial aspect of the right lower lung zone, concerning for pneumonia.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
There is ground glass opacity in the right middle lobe with consolidation and bronchograms concerning for focal pneumonia.
Bibasilar atelectasis is present at the lung bases.
Allowing for this factor, the liver is nodular without focal mass, consistent with cirrhosis.
Multiple paraesophageal varices are identified.
There is a small hiatal hernia.
There is no definitive gallbladder wall thickening.
No stones or hydronephrosis are identified within the kidneys.
There are extensive calcifications throughout the abdominal aorta and its branches.
There is moderate ascites with pockets of low-density fluid intercalating throughout the mesentery.
Small bubbles of free air are identified along the anterior abdominal wall, likely secondary to recent paracentesis.
There are small ventral hernias containing nonobstructed loops of colon.
There is no evidence of obstruction or large intraperitoneal abscess.
The small bowel is relatively unchanged in appearance with multiple areas of bowel wall thickening.
There are numerous mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes which do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Moderate ascites is again identified with a layering density in the cul-de-sac with a few air bubbles, perhaps reflecting a small hematoma.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
No evidence of bowel obstruction as contrast and air are seen extending throughout the colon to the level of the distal sigmoid.
Nodular liver varices and splenomegaly consistent with cirrhosis.
Moderate ascites is present.
Focal ground glass opacity in the right mid to lower lobe concerning for pneumonia.
Small pockets of free intraperitoneal air, likely secondary to recent paracentesis.
No evidence of pneumatosis or pneumobilia.
Multiple areas of small bowel wall thickening, relatively unchanged compared to prior study without evidence of abscess.
There is no evidence of focal hepatic mass or intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
There is significant lower quadrant ascites.
The gallbladder wall is thickened and the gallbladder is slightly distended.
No pericholecystic fluid or definite stones are identified.
Spot marked in the left lower quadrant for paracentesis.
Findings consistent with hepatic cirrhosis.
CLINICAL DATA: Ascites, now with SBP, heterogenous liver, prior   Cytology with malignant cells.
Predominantly neutrophils with rare reactive mesothelial   cells and monocytes.
Low limb lead voltage.
Q waves in leads V1-V2 suggest prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Left atrial abnormality.
Q waves in leads III and aVF suggest prior inferior myocardial infarction.
Left axis deviation suggestive of possible left anterior fascicular block.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2134-5-9**] there has been no diagnostic interval change.
PARACENTESIS DIAG.
Following this, three liters of serosanguinous ascitic fluid were aspirated.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, with no complications evident at the time of the procedure.
Rare atypical cells present in a background of reactive   mesothelial cells and inflammatory cells, can not exclude   malignancy.
CT ABD&PELVIS W/O C COLON TECHNIQUE  [**2134-5-25**] 5:24 PM ABDOMEN CT WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The hazy opacity with septal thickening and interstitial disease in the right middle lobe has decreased since [**2134-5-21**], likely reflecting resolving pneumonia and atelectasis.
Bilateral subsegmental atelectasis in the lower lobes persist.
Bilateral small pleural effusions persist.
As before, there is a hiatal hernia.
As before, there are esophageal varices.
The liver remains a nodular in contour and has volume redistribution consistent with cirrhosis.
There are no masses within the liver.
There is extensive ascites.
There is minimal enhancement of the peritoneal lining, not unexpected in someone with recent paracentesis.
There is a normal appearance of the pancreas and main pancreatic duct.
The gallbladder is mildly distended but has a thin wall.
There is retroperitoneal fat stranding, particularly about the celiac axis with some small lymph nodes, which is a nonspecific finding.
There are multiple mesenteric lymph nodes, which is slightly increased since [**4-5**], also nonspecific.
There is extensive central small bowel wall thickening and extensive enhancement of segment of proximal small bowel, similar in appearance to recent CTs, likely reflecting patient's ongoing active Crohn's disease.
No bowel obstruction.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST: There is small amount of gas within patient's ascites within the pelvis, likely reflecting recent paracentesis.
There is no lymphadenopathy within the pelvis.
There is extensive pelvic ascites.
There is soft tissue stranding and edema within the buttocks and proximal bilateral lower extremities.
CT COLONOGRAPHY: There is slightly limited evaluation of the rectum because of fluid, however, no definite rectal lesions are seen on either pre-contrast or post-contrast images.
Sigmoid colon is well evaluated, as is the descending colon and splenic flexure, the latter particularly on the post-contrast images and there are no lesions to suggest colon cancer.
The transverse colon is well distended on the supine images and is without polyp or evidence of cancer.
The hepatic flexure is slightly suboptimally seen over a short segment, however, it is distended on the prone imaging and there are no findings to suggest cancer.
The ascending colon and cecum are well distended, particularly on the prone images and are without findings to suggest adenocarcinoma or polyps.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions within the bones.
Multiplanar reformats were essential in evaluating the colon, small bowel, and remainder of the abdomen.
No findings to suggest adenocarcinoma within the colon.
No evidence for adenocarcinoma elsewhere.
Extensive small bowel enhancement and wall thickening, particularly in the central abdomen and left upper quadrant is not significantly changed from [**2134-4-3**].
Slightly increased lymphadenopathy within the mesentery and within the retroperitoneum about the celiac and SMA are slightly increased, likely related to patient's Crohn's disease, however, this is uncertain.
Extensive ascites, however, there is no concerning peritoneal enhancement or evidence of peritoneal nodularity to suggest carcinomatosis.
Resolving right middle lobe disease likely reflects clearing pneumonia.
Initial son[**Name (NI) 493**] imaging demonstrated a large volume of ascites throughout the abdomen.
Under son[**Name (NI) 493**] guidance, a site was selected for paracentesis in the left lower quadrant.
An 18 gauge [**Last Name (un) 11097**] needle was then advanced into the ascitic pocket and 5 liters of ascitic fluid were aspirated.
Poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma with ulceration.
Immunostains of the tumor are positive for cytokeratin CK-20 and negative for CK-7, with satisfactory controls.
Mild chronic inactive inflammation, with tiny focus of intestinal metaplasia.
Note: The features of the tumor are consistent with a primary intestinal origin.
EGD [**2134-5-27**] Erythema and friability in the antrum compatible with gastritis (biopsy) Mass in the mid jejunum at 50cms (biopsy) Otherwise normal small bowel enteroscopy to mid jejunum.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 916**] is a 63 yo male with Crohn's disease, IgA deficiency, admitted with abdominal pain and ascites, lower extremity edema found to have SBP/bacteremia and malignant ascites.
# SBP/Malignant Ascites/Liver disease - Patient has a h/o nodular regenerative hyperplasia with new ascites x several months.
Based on the reports of Pathology, Cytology and Flow Cytometry, it was unclear as to the origin of the malignancy ddx: Adenocarcinoma vs Lymphoma.
The tumor Cells are CEA positive, CDK20 positive and CDK 7 negative which is consistent w/ an Adenocarcinoma most likely originated from the GI tract, based on the patient's hx of Crohn's Disease, Adenocarcinoma of the Colon is a possibility that we need to r/o, his last Colonoscopy was [**4-3**] ys ago, and there's a hx of Malignant Polyp many years ago according to the patient.
He had a virtual colonoscopy showing evidence of multiple areas of small bowel wall thickening (have worsened since [**2131**]).
No other increased lymphadenopathy noted.
His ascitic fluid from [**5-10**] was read as large atypical cells with scant cytoplasm.
His flow cytometry from this fluid shows that 70% of cells are T-cells that express mature T-lineage antigens (CD3,5,2,7) and have a helper-to-cytotoxic ratio of 0.78.
Oncology evaluated the patient and after reviewing the pathology, cytology and immunohistochemistry findings determined that the most likely diagnosis was a poorly differentiated GI Carcinoma.
# Bacteremia/Bacterial Peritonitis: Patient grew both [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Veillonella in both the peritoneal fluid and blood.
Likely multifactorial given chronic illness, GI malignancy likely.
No evidence of active bleeding.
Patient was treated with high dose steroids given his acute infection with Hydrocortisone 100 mg q 8 hrs x 3 doses.
He was no longer hypotensive after his initial episode.
# IgA deficiency.
Monthly IVIG infusions, no active issues.
# HTN - BP meds held in setting of hypotension initially.
# Hypothyroidism.
