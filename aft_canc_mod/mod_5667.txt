Admission Date:  [**2124-5-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2124-6-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2048-10-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**] Chief Complaint: Upper GI Bleed .
History of Present Illness: 75 M with hx of PUD, PVD s/p fem-fem bypass on coumadin, emphysema, who originally presented to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] with one week of nausea and vomiting, diffuse abd pain, decreased PO intake, and decreased urination.
He was found to have a UTI and received a dose of levaquin.
He was started on vasopressin as a single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] for concern about possible esophageal varices.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Hyperlipidemia PVD, s/p LLE bypass at [**Hospital1 2025**] in [**2115**] with revision in [**2116-3-11**] [**2118**] s/p left deep femoral artery->peroneal bypass by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], left fifth ray amputation for osteomyelitis [**6-17**]: left common iliac stenting, left external iliac artery stenting [**2123-7-10**]: fem-fem bypass, right femoral to popliteal bypass PUD (per records in CCC- patient denies) Emphysema Sclerosing cholangitis Cholecystectomy Appendectomy [**4-16**]: spontaneous pneumothorax ([**Hospital3 **]) Alcohol use- 3-4 beers per day   Social History: Patient is divorced and lives alone.
No definite focal consolidation identified, although the right costophrenic angle is excluded from the image.
Unchanged nodular densities within the lungs.
Right upper lobe nodule concerning for possible malignancy, and further evaluation with CT recommended.
Within the liver, multiple discrete hypodense lesions are seen which are most consistent with metastatic disease.
There is no obvious intra- or extrahepatic biliary dilatation seen.
There is some dilatation of the stomach, the cause of which is not readily apparent.
No [**Hospital1 **] evidence of wall thickening is seen.
No real adjacent  lymphadenopathy of note.
No visible vessel.
Severe esophagitis.
Colonoscopy [**6-2**]: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and distal descending colon Mass in the mid-transverse colon (injection, biopsy) Small, yellow, plaque-like lesions on an erythematous base were noted just poximal to the mass.
Transverse Colon biopsy [**6-2**]: A. Colon (transverse), mucosal biopsy: Colonic mucosa with regenerative changes and fragments of fibrinopurulent exudate, consistent with ulceration.
No submucosa is present to evaluate for invasion.
Bilateral ABI [**6-7**]: Doppler waveform analysis reveals a biphasic waveform at the right common femoral and popliteal arteries with monophasic waveforms at the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial.
On the left there are monophasic waveforms at the common femoral and popliteal with absent DP and PT signals.
Pulse volume recordings reveal mild blunting at the thigh on the right, there is dampening at the level of the calf and again at the ankle on the right.
On the left there is a severely dampened waveform at the common femoral level with a further severe dampening at the calf and a essentially flat trace at the ankle and metatarsal.
IMPRESSION: Significant left aortoiliac and bilateral SFA and tibial disease.
Brief Hospital Course: 75M with hx of PUD, PVD s/p fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass on coumadin, emphysema, transferred from [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] to our MICU with severe blood loss anemia, elevated INR, UTI, and sepsis s/p intubation.
Now found to have mass in transverse colon suspicious for malignancy with mets to liver and awaiting surgery recs and biopsy results.
# s/p UGI bleed: Patient with giant duodenal ulcer which was likely cause for severe anemia and Hct of 10 upon arrival at OSH.
EGD showing no active bleeding so blood loss was likely chronic.
Patient's supratherpeutic INR (thought to be [**2-12**] shock liver in setting of sepsis and possible infiltrative disease) also reversed with FFP.
# transverse colon/liver lesions concerning for malignancy: Colonoscopy on [**2124-6-2**] showing 4cm mass in transverse colon suspicious for malignancy.
Given high CEA, normal AFP, and appearance of liver lesions more consistent with metastasis on CT scan, most likely this is GI primary with liver metastasis.
Patient able to pass stool, no abdominal pain.
No acute bleed.
Biopsy of the transverse colon mass from the colonoscopy was inconclusive.
It revealed tissue consistent with an adenoma however the tissue sample was superficial and likely inadequate to provide evidence of invasion.
Oncology recommended a biopsy of his liver lesions to obtain a more definitive tissue diagnosis.
He had ultrasound guided liver biopsy on [**6-9**] and results are pending at the time of discharge.
# Respiratory: The patient was intubated at the OSH for unclear indications, possibly hematemesis, and post endoscopy, was successfully extubated on [**2124-5-29**].
If patient with respiratory difficulty, could be due to emphysema/copd, possible pleural thickening, bleb which is concerning for malignancy in this patient with weight loss/smoking history, or fluid overload.
Currently patient breathing comfortably on 2L NC O2 but with course breath sounds.
Pt had speech/swallow eval on [**5-30**] but if patient with difficulty with current diet, can reeval by video swallow for aspiration .
# Hypotension: Resolved.
# Transaminitis: Shock liver with sepsis/septic shock in MICU with infiltrative with liver lesions concerning for malignancy.
Abdominal US showed no biliary tree abnormalities.
# ARF: Prerenal and resolved with IVF resuscitation.
# PVD: s/p fem fem bypass with lower extremity ulcers on feet bilaterally, no sign of infection.
# Sacral decub ulcer: patient seen by wound care nurse on [**5-29**].
# Nutrition: Pt appeared cachectic and had low albumin.
Plan was for him to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] in oncology for results of his liver biopsy and to discuss the treatment plan for his likely metastatic malignancy.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Palm [**Hospital 731**] Nursing Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Final diagnosis Colonic mass suspicious for malignancy Upper gastrointestinal bleed .
You had a CT scan which showed a mass in your colon and also lesions in your liver consistent with cancer.
If you develop bleeding, lightheadedness or dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, or fevers > 101, you should call your doctor or return to the emergency room.
