HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79 year old coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with stenting in [**2120-7-13**], who presented to an outside hospital on [**2120-8-11**], acutely tachypneic and hypoxic.
CT angiogram at outside hospital demonstrated multiple pulmonary emboli.
Incidentally, CT scan for abdominal aortic aneurysm.
He was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for observation and treatment of his pulmonary emboli.
Coronary artery disease, initially diagnosed with positive stress test in [**Month (only) 547**] of this year.
The patient had a three vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2120-7-13**], followed by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting several days after coronary artery bypass graft.
Postoperative course was complicated by atrial fibrillation and possible aspiration pneumonia.
Squamous cell cancer of the left lip that was diagnosed in [**2120-5-13**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient was afebrile with a temperature of 97.8, heart rate 84, blood pressure 115/68, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 96% on 100% nonrebreather.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - The patient had anicteric sclera.
On the left lower lip, the patient has a 2.0 by 3.0 centimeter ulcerating lesion with retraction.
Neck - There is no cervical lymphadenopathy, but the patient does have a large 1.5 centimeter submandibular lymph node.
No jugular venous distention was noted.
Lung examination - The patient had breath sounds bilaterally with faint crackles at the bases, expiratory wheezing throughout, no dullness to percussion.
Cardiovascular - regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities - The patient had no lower extremity edema and no Homans' sign.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with normal axis and first degree AV block.
There were T wave inversions in V1 and V2 which were new since the patient's previous electrocardiograms.
The patient also had increased ST-T wave abnormalities in V4 through V6.
CT from the outside hospital was reviewed here and showed multiple filling defects in branches of the left and right pulmonary arteries and small bilateral pleural effusions that had been present post coronary artery bypass graft.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, this is a 79 year old male who developed dyspnea and hypoxia in coronary artery bypass graft postoperative period with CT scan that was positive for multiple pulmonary emboli.
The patient continued to have expiratory wheezing bilaterally in his lung fields throughout the course of his admission and it was felt that given the patient's long smoking history and chest x-ray with flattened diaphragms that he probably had some element of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Amiodarone was stopped since it was felt that it was probably started due to his postoperative atrial fibrillation without events and the patient remained in normal sinus rhythm after Amiodarone was discontinued.
In addition to the patient's rhythm issues, given his history of coronary artery disease and recent revascularization, he was periodically evaluated for signs of ischemia with electrocardiograms.
The patient remained chest pain free throughout the course of his stay.
Electrocardiograms throughout the course of his stay showed inverted T waves in leads V2 through V6 that were consistent with his recent pulmonary emboli.
Cardiac Function - The patient's preoperative echocardiogram had showed a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%.
It was decided to reevaluate his left ventricular function status given that he was a month postoperative from coronary artery bypass graft.
Throughout the course of his stay, the patient was gently hydrated due to his depressed left ventricular function, occasionally developing volume overload including rales at his bases bilaterally for which he was gently diuresed with Lasix p.r.n.
Renal - The patient had some element of acute renal insufficiency on presentation with an elevated creatinine.
His FENA was 0.49% as the patient was felt to be prerenal and volume depleted.
After the Foley was removed, however, the patient had difficulty initiating urinary stream and a tendency towards urinary retention.
Urinalysis was sent which showed many bacteria, [**4-16**] white blood cells and for this, the patient was started on Ciprofloxacin to treat urinary tract infection.
Given the patient's low ejection fraction and poor cardiac function, it was difficult to balance the patient's fluid status throughout the course of his stay.
The patient required multiple fluid boluses for low urine output followed by subsequent gentle diuresis with Lasix p.r.n.
Oncology - The patient was seen by oral head and neck surgery service here while he was in house for evaluation of the squamous cell cancer on his lip.
Surveillance head and neck CT scan done while the patient was in house in addition to the ulcerative lesion on his lip two submandibular lymph nodes that were enlarged probably representing metastases but no erosion into the bony structures of the calvarium.
intake during his stay based on pain from his lip lesion and inability to put his dentures in to chew his food.
The patient was encouraged to take as much Boost and high protein pudding as possible but this remains an ongoing issue with this patient.
Fluids additionally remained a very difficult issue while the patient was in house.
to avoid becoming dehydrated, however, when given intravenous fluids, the patient tended to become volume overloaded and have difficulty voiding as well.
Endocrine - The patient's TSH was checked while he was here and it was found to be elevated at 5.6.
The patient also had a questionable recent diagnosis of diabetes mellitus that was diagnosed in the postoperative period and the patient was on Glyburide when he arrived.
However, fingersticks throughout the course of his stay here were all within normal limits after the patient's Glyburide was discontinued and it was felt that his diabetes mellitus was probably reactive to the stress of postoperative period and that he could discontinue his Glyburide indefinitely.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1159**] was going to coordinate patient follow-up regarding his squamous cell cancer in the area closest to the patient's home and it is likely the patient will need radiation oncology intervention to palliate his lip lesion until he becomes stable from the surgical perspective.
q12hours times three days for his urinary tract infection.
