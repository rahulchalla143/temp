Admission Date:  [**2150-4-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2150-4-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2077-3-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12**] Chief Complaint: Unresponsive episode at dialysis.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 100984**] is a 73yo M w/hx of NHL on Bendamustine (C3D17) and ESRD [**2-16**] DM on HD who was recently hospitalized multiple times for pneumonia.
On [**2150-4-6**] he was found unresponsive near the end of his scheduled dialysis session.
It is unclear if he had a fever at that time.
Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ==================== Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (follicular low-grade B-cell NHL grade I, diagnosed in [**2142**]), on Bendemustine Adriamycin cardiomyopathy EF 30% Aortic Stenosis End-stage kidney disease on HD MWF Type 2 diabetes mellitus Gout Meningioma Spinal stenosis- s/p surgery [**51**] yrs ago Osteoarthritis of the hips s/p b/l THR  PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: ====================== He was diagnosed in the year [**2141**] when biopsy of a cervical node revealed follicular low-grade B-cell NHL grade I.
His total dose never exceeded 450/sq meter but in [**12/2148**] he had shortness of breath on exertion.
His dyspnea is improved when he has had dialysis [**Doctor Last Name **] to removal of fluid but he develops hypotension and therefore this approach has its limitations.
Two months ago [**Known firstname **] was found to have a thrombosis in the A-V fistula in his left arm.
He does not drink alcohol and denies the use of illicit or illegal drugs.
Family History: Mother had diabetes mellitus and died at the age of [**Age over 90 **] years.
GENERAL: well-appearing man, NAD, breathing comfortably SKIN: warm and well perfused, no excoriations or lesions, no rashes; HD catheter site without erythema or fluid pockets HEENT: AT/NC, EOMI, PERRLA, anicteric sclera, pink conjunctiva, patent nares, MMM, good dentition, nontender supple neck, no LAD, no JVD CARDIAC: RRR, S1/S2, no mrg LUNG: LLL crackles, diffuse wheezes and rhonchi scattered throughout ABDOMEN: nondistended, +BS, nontender in all quadrants, no rebound/guarding, no hepatosplenomegaly EXT: trace edema in ankles, shins bilaterally PULSES: 2+ DP pulses bilaterally NEURO: CN II-XII intact, [**5-19**] muscle strength, no sensory deficits  Pertinent Results: Admission labs: [**2150-4-6**] 12:55PM BLOOD WBC-2.3* RBC-3.16* Hgb-10.8* Hct-32.6* MCV-103* MCH-34.2* MCHC-33.2 RDW-16.4* Plt Ct-76* [**2150-4-6**] 12:55PM BLOOD Neuts-67.5 Lymphs-19.0 Monos-11.3* Eos-1.9 Baso-0.3 [**2150-4-7**] 02:30AM BLOOD Hypochr-OCCASIONAL Anisocy-1+ Poiklo-OCCASIONAL Macrocy-1+ Microcy-OCCASIONAL Polychr-OCCASIONAL Ovalocy-OCCASIONAL Schisto-OCCASIONAL Tear Dr[**Last Name (STitle) 833**] [**2150-4-6**] 12:55PM BLOOD PT-14.0* PTT-26.8 INR(PT)-1.2* [**2150-4-6**] 12:55PM BLOOD Glucose-126* UreaN-32* Creat-3.7* Na-139 K-4.1 Cl-97 HCO3-30 AnGap-16 [**2150-4-6**] 12:55PM BLOOD Calcium-8.9 Phos-1.9* Mg-1.5* [**2150-4-6**] 01:05PM BLOOD Lactate-1.4 .
Interval development of left perihilar opacity likely in the left lower lobe concerning for pneumonia.
Persistent reticular nodular opacity in the right lower lung which likely represents persistent or recurrent airway infection.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-7-17**], mitral regurgitation appears similar, aortic valve gradient is similar (valve area was underestimated in the prior report), estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now lower, left ventricular ejection fraction appears similar although today's images are technically suboptimal.
Interval development of dense consolidation in the left lower lobe with air bronchograms and surrounding ground-glass halo, which raises the concern for bacterial or fungal infection.
Bronchovascular opacity and consolidation in the right lower lobe shows some interval improvement consistent with resolving right lower lobe pneumonia.
Streaks of atelectasis are seen at the right base and there is blunting of both costophrenic angles.
Minimal residual engorgement of the pulmonary vessels.
CXR [**2150-4-9**]: No significant interval change with consolidation at the left greater than right base consistent with known pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 100985**] is a very nice 73 YO gentleman with NHL (C3D17) on Bendemustine (last dose [**2150-3-25**]), ESRD on HD, who presented with fever and LLL infiltrate on CXR and CT.  Also hypotensive on pressors in the MICU with concerns for pneumosepsis.
LLL Pneumonia: Patietn was admitted to the floor with presumntive bacterial community acquired pneumonia and then triggered for hypotension and was transfered to the MICU.
He was started on Levophed for BP, Vanc, Zosyn and Azithromycin (Azithro was discontinued after 2 days) for hospital acquired pneumonia in a patient with an indwelling hemodialysis line.
MICU course complicated by tachycardia with HD, fevers (last on [**2150-4-8**]), neutropenia with ANC of 590 after chemotherapy, and hypotension on Levophed, which was stopped on [**2150-4-8**].
He was able to maintain remarkably clear sensorium and remained symptoms free even when his blood pressures dipped into 70s systolic.
His SpO2 was stable in the medical floor after the ICU and patient was able to walk short distances without any SOB or O2 requirements.
Hypotension: Pt has low baseline but etiologies initially considered were sepsis and cardiogenic shock.
It was thought that patient was in septic shock with very poor cardiac reserve due to chronic systolic heart failure.
Chronic Kidney Disease: on HD.
His phosphate binders were continued, he was put on [**Last Name (STitle) **] diet and required extra HD sessions for fluid management.
Type II DM: pt reports episode of hypoglycemia at home with FSBS of 40s week prior to admission.
It causes pancytopenia with [**Last Name (un) 12899**] at 3 weeks ([**2150-4-15**]).
Also can cause hypotension in 6% of patients.
Acute on chronic heart failure - Patient had multiple episode of atrial fibrilation with his heart with poor reserve.
He also had a difficult ICU course, which could precipitated his heart failure.
He had bibasilary crackles and SOB in the medicine floor after the ICU.
Atrial Fibrillation - Patient had multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation that lasted few minutes.
He had no history of prior AFib.
However, he has cardiomyopathy and chronic heart failure with poor EF.
Ipratropium Bromide 17 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 Puffs Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing for 10 days.

Secondary Diagnosis: Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (follicular low-grade B-cell NHL grade I, diagnosed in [**2142**]), on Bendemustine Adriamycin cardiomyopathy EF 30% Aortic Stenosis End-stage kidney disease on HD MWF Type 2 diabetes mellitus  Discharge Condition: Stable, tolerating PO, ambulating, breathing comfortably on room air.
Discharge Instructions: You were seen at the [**Hospital1 18**] for shortness of breath.
You were found to have a pneumonia on chest x-ray and CT scan and were started on antibiotics.
Then you had rapid heart rate with a rhythm called atrial fibrillation.
It can cause bleeding, so if you have black stools, blood on stools or anything else that concerns you call your PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) **] your coreg and took care of your heart rhythm.
