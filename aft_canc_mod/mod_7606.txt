He notes left shoulder pain for 1 week.
Went to [**Hospital1 **] and had STE in inferior leads with troponin of 44 and on catheterization had mid LAD proximal right and left circumflex stenoses.
Proximal right lesion was thought to be chronic.

MRSA Screen [**2113-10-20**]: No MRSA isolated.
Three vessel coronary artery disease with 100% mid LAD, 100% proximal and mid RCA, and 95% distal LCx.
TTE [**2113-10-21**]: LVEF 30% The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall LV systolic function appears moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the inferior free wall, and akinesis of the posterior wall and apex.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Anterolateral T wave inversions and ST segment depression suggest active myocardial ischemia.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] yo male with hx of CAD, past LAD occlusion with moderate RCA disease and distal OM disease, HLD, recent admission for SBO and ?mucinous tumor of appendix, lupus anticoagulant positive, prior CVA on coumadin presents with inferior STEMI.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES: .
# STEMI/CAD: Mr. [**Known lastname 91743**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after presenting to OSH ED with ST elevations in inferior leads (per report) and a troponin of 44 after collapsing at home.
He was taken to the cath lab and found to have severe 3VD with 100% mid LAD occulsion with collaterals, chronic 100% proximal RCA occlusion and 95% left Cx distal occlusion with diffusely calcified vessels without intervention.
# HTN: Stable.
# HLD: Stable.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES: .
# Anemia: Chronic per atrius records.
# Mucinous cystadenoma of appendix with recent SBO: apparent new dx per atrius records.
Pt without symptoms during this hospitalization.
Unclear if this played a role in his STEMI as his CAD is very severe.
# Weight loss of 12lbs at home, he should have age-appropriate malignancy workup as an outpatient and continued follow-up for his mucinous cystadenoma.
#Spironolactone: Pt has CHF and would benefit from an optimized regimen that would include spironolactone as his pressures tolerate.

Discharge Instructions: You had a fainting epidode at home and had a heart attack.
A cardiac catheterization showed multiple blockages in your heart arteries that did not appear to be acute.
No balloon or stenting procedure was done and you did not want to consider heart surgery.
Your heart is a little weak since the heart attack and you need to watch carefully for signs of fluid retention.

Please also watch for swelling in your legs or trouble breathing while walking or lying down flat.

START taking nitroglycerin as needed if you have chest pain.
Wait 5 minutes, take one more tablet if you still have chest pain.
Call 911 for chest pain that isn't gone after 2 nitroglycerin tablets, call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if you have any chest pain at home.
