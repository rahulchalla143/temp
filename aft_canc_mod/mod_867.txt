Admission Date:  [**2151-1-16**]     Discharge Date:  [**2151-1-19**]  Date of Birth:   [**2083-7-16**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Internal Medicine [**Doctor Last Name **] Firm  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old man with a past medical history significant for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, currently in remission since [**2146**] after chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgical resection, who was in his usual state of health until the morning of admission when he woke up feeling fatigued.
Patient states he grew increasingly short of breath with walking around at around 11 in the morning; he got out of his car at 12:45 pm and walked up some stairs, whereupon he became even more short of breath, lightheaded, and dizzy.
A CT scan of the chest was done at the outside hospital which revealed bilateral massive pulmonary emboli.
He had a lymph node and parotid biopsy on the right side which showed follicular small cell cleaved lymphoma.
He also had a right tibial biopsy during workup of a tibial mass which showed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of a large cell diffuse type.
He is status post parotid gland removal with recurrence of right neck non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in [**2145**].
He then underwent more XRT and CHOP, and he eventually underwent an autologous stem cell transplant in [**2147-4-25**] that was complicated by febrile neutropenia.
Knee surgeries:  Arthroscopic meniscus repair in [**2146**], total knee replacement on the right in [**2150-4-25**] complicated by infection requiring washout and plastic surgery as well as chronic antibiotic therapy for positive cultures, coag-neg Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella.
FAMILY HISTORY:  [**Name (NI) **] father died at the age of 52 of a myocardial infarction.
Patient has a brother who died of cancer when he was 41.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for occasional chest pain lasting 15-30 seconds over the past 4-5 months.
Positive for knee pain which is chronic.
Positive for muscle tightness in his calf.
Positive for nausea, but no vomiting.
His review of systems is negative for angina on exertion, calf pain, or tenderness, fever, chills, cough, or hemoptysis, diaphoresis, night sweats, chills, decreased appetite, or weight loss.
His physical examination was remarkable for a right cheek and right neck surgical scar, no jugular venous distention, clear lungs, a tachycardic heart that was regular in rhythm, but had distant heart sounds, but no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, a guaiac negative rectal examination, and an extremity examination which revealed a warm right lower extremity that was slightly swollen, but had no cords, [**Last Name (un) 5813**] sign or excessive tenderness.
CT scan of the chest as mentioned earlier showed bilateral pulmonary emboli and no hilar masses, lymphadenopathy, or effusions.
An electrocardiogram was obtained in the hospital which revealed sinus tachycardia at 100, normal axis, and normal intervals with no ischemic changes, and a S1 and an inverted T wave in III.
ASSESSMENT:  This 67-year-old man with a history of a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and knee surgery, who complains of shortness of breath x1 day and has been diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary emboli at an outside hospital, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for potential lytic therapy.
The patient was diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary emboli from a CT scan.
The patient has a family history of coronary artery disease, is a smoker, and is over 55, all of which were risk factors for developing coronary artery disease and being at risk for an ischemic or infarct event.
Given his prior history of chest pain in the past, the patient was tested for infarct or ischemia with serial electrocardiograms and cardiac enzymes.
His second set of enzymes revealed a troponin of 4, but this is likely that this was secondary to heart strain from the pulmonary emboli.
The patient underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram for assessment of hemodynamic stability as well as free wall motion abnormalities that may indicate a cardiac event.
Given the patient's diagnosis of pulmonary emboli, the differential diagnosis behind the cause of this included former knee surgery which could predispose hypercoagulation, a coagulation disorder which is highly unlikely, and a recurrent malignancy.
The patient had lower extremity Dopplers which revealed active clot in the superficial femoral and the common femoral vein.
The patient has a history of right knee coag-neg Staph and Klebsiella since [**Month (only) **], and has been on chronic levofloxacin and rifampin.
The patient had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, but he was started on a proton-pump inhibitor.
LFTs were checked to rule out any alcoholic liver disease, and these were negative for any active disease.
