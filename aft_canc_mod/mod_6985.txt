She has a been having problems with constipation in the setting of opiate analgesics.
She has not had any diarrhea or BRBPR.
Additionally, she received PO contrast yesterday for CT. After her CT, she vomited contrast, and there was no blood seen.
She was found to have BRBPR on rectal exam, but not passing any stool.

Past Medical History: Oncologic History: -- [**4-/2153**] CT with evidence of metastatic disease with multiple right pleural metastases and moderate-to-large right pleural effusion; solitary lung metastases, multiple liver metastases, right adrenal metastases, and several pancreatic metastases.
-- [**2153-5-4**] Biopsy of pleural implants was performed and showed tumor that displayed a high mitotic rate, necrosis and involvement of skeletal muscle.
Immunohistochemical studies showed positive staining of the tumor cells with cytokeratin, TTF-1, synaptophysin and chromogranin.
These findings support the diagnosis of small cell lung cancer.
The patient's prior breast resection was also reviewed (S05-[**Numeric Identifier **], slide G), displaying a tumor with low grade morphologic features.Based on the above mentioned findings, the patient has evidence of extensive stage small cell lung cancer.
Her course was complicated by neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.
No history of cancer, GI bleed, or coagulopathy.

There remains bilateral pleural effusions, right side greater than left with some loculation of the pleural fluid on the right base.
There is calcification of the thoracic aorta.
There are no overt consolidations or signs for pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: 69yo female with breast and lung cancer on active treatment, who presented with orthostatic symptoms in the setting of 12 point drop in HCT to 14 and BRBPR noted on rectal exam.
# BRBPR:  The patient had no history of passing blood per rectum, but was noted to have bright red blood on rectal exam in ED.
It was thought that her bleeding was due to a combination of marrow suppression from chemotherapy and a slow GI bleed.
She was to have an endoscopy performed by GI, but this was initially deferred when the patient developed chest pain.
An EKG was checked and showed no evidence of ischemia, and cardiac enzymes were negative.
She had one guiac positive bowel movement after transfer, but did not have any additional bloody bowel movements or BRBPR prior to discharge.
# Hypoxia: The patient developed a new oxygen requirement during this admission.
There was initially some concern for pulmonary edema in setting of transfusion, however CXR did not show evidence of overt edema or consolidation.
Of note, CXR did show bilateral pleural effusions.
# Small cell lung cancer: The patient has been on recent treatment, with carboplatin and etoposide, and was scheduled to begin her next cycle of chemotherapy on [**2153-9-3**].
Her counts were closely monitored in setting of recent chemo, and as above she was transfused with both PRBCs and platelets during this admission.
She was ordered for ondansetron and prochlorperazine for nausea, but did not have significant symptoms of N/V during this hospital admission.
HTN: The patient has a h/o HTN, and her home regimen included quinapril, HCTZ, and nifedipine.
The patient's anti-hypertensives were held during the admission, especially given hypotension and acute bleeding on presentation.
