Physical Exam: On Presentation:  Vitals: T:98.8 BP:119/82 HR:56 RR:14 O2Sat:97% 2L GEN: Well-appearing, well-nourished, no acute distress HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, no epistaxis or rhinorrhea, MMM, OP Clear NECK: No JVD, carotid pulses brisk, no bruits, no cervical lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: RRR, no M/G/R, normal S1 S2, radial pulses +2 PULM: Lungs CTAB, no W/R/R ABD: Soft, mild TTP in R&L UQ, ND, +BS, no HSM, no masses.
No gait disturbance.
No cerebellar dysfunction.
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses   Pertinent Results: IMAGING: Bleeding Scan: Blood flow images show hyperemia in the left pelvis overlying the sigmoid.
IMPRESSION: Active GI bleeding localizing to the sigmoid colon.
Brief Hospital Course: Assesment: This is a 78 year-old female with a history of CAD s/p stent >3 years ago, chronic pancreatitis, h/o breast CA, who presents with hematochezia.
Bleeding scan showed bleeding in sigmoid colon.
# BRBPR: Had 2 episodes prior to hospital and then passage of two small volume stools with bright red blood and some clot in the ED.
Suspected diverticular bleeding vs AVM; prior unremarkable coloscopy makes malignancy less likely.
Bleeding scan showed sigmoid bleed, likley diverticular; pt did pass a large amount of clot shortly after bleeding scan with vasovagal event, and then went for angio which did not identify any active bleeding.
She was called out to the medical floor where she was prepped for colonoscopy.
Diverticulosis was seen in the sigmoid colon but no active bleeding.
# Epigastric pain: Inital concern for pancreatitis given her history of prior history of it.
Per out patient providers and the patient, abdominal pain is chronic.
# CAD s/p stent: stent was >3 years ago, and given bleeding, held aspirin and clopidogrel.
# HTN: her antihypertensives were initially held in the setting of acute GIB but these were restarted as she showed stability after transfusion.
This was likely from diverticulosis as seen on a colonoscopy done during your hospitalization.
You should NOT take your aspirin or Plavix for now; discuss with your cardiologist about if and when to restart either of these medications.
We recommend you adhere to a low residue diet to reduce the risk of diverticular bleeding.
If you have further bloody stools, abdominal pain, lightheadedness, episodes of loss of consciousness, shortness of breath, chest pain, or any other concerning symptoms, call your doctor or seek medical attention immediately.
