Innumerable small hypodensities are seen throughout the liver, measuring up to 14 mm in the right hepatic lobe (2:28).
There are also innumerable, similar-appearing hypodensities throughout the spleen.
There is a 7-mm hypodense lesion in the pancreatic body (2:22), possibly a cyst versus side-branch IPMN.
There is no dilation of the main pancreatic duct or common duct.
There is no intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.
No focal renal lesions are identified.
There is no hydronephrosis.
There is extensive diverticulosis, predominantly involving the sigmoid colon, without definite evidence for diverticulitis.
There is a small quantity of free fluid within the mesentery and dependent portion of the pelvis.
There is no free air in the abdomen.
Multiple enlarged lymph nodes are seen along the retroperitoneum, specifically in the aortocaval region.
This lesion demonstrates central hypodensity, consistent  with necrosis (2:31, 601B:26).
An additional representative node within the aortocaval region measures 2.6 x 1.6 cm (2:34).
There are no pathologically enlarged pelvic lymph nodes.
BONE WINDOW:  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified.
Innumerable hepatic and splenic small hypodensities, concerning for lymphoma versus metastases, although an infectious process cannot be entirely excluded.
The presence of bulkly retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy would favor a neoplastic process.
Small volume ascites, predominantly within the dependent portion of the pelvis.
7-mm hypodense lesion in the pancreatic body, possibly a cyst versus side-branch IPMN.
Extensive colonic diverticulosis, particularly involving the sigmoid colon, without evidence of diverticulitis.
Viable areas demonstrate mild steatosis and a polymorphous lymphoid infiltrate, which focally effaces the liver parenchyma.
Liver biopsy results indicate a lymphoma with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (grey zone lymphoma).
In this case, a Hodgkin lymphoma is favored for the following reasons: 1) Co-expression of CD30, [**Male First Name (un) **].2, [**9-28**] and PAX5 with evidence of EBV-infection (LMP+) is more likely to be associated with Hodgkin Lymphoma.
3) The subsequent biopsy of the patient's bone marrow (S12-31075H) revealed patchy infiltration by a lymphoma containing classic [**Doctor Last Name **]-Sternberg cells and an appropriate immunoreactive background.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST ([**2173-7-17**]): IMPRESSION:  No evidence of intracranial lymphoma.
No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT ([**2173-7-18**]): IMPRESSION:  No left upper extremity deep venous thrombosis.

MICU Course: #Fever: He had a high fever in the setting of vague weakness, slight jaundice, and hepatic lesions.
Possible diagnoses included acute viral hepatitis vs. tick-[**Location (un) **] illness (human ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis and Babesia) vs malignancy.
Less likely on the differential included autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, and lower biliary process.
Acute HIV was also considered.
He was started on vanc/zosyn/doxycycline for empiric coverage.
CT abdomen revealed innumerable hepatic and splenic small hypodensities, concerning for lymphoma versus metastases, w/ infection also possible.
A 7-mm hypodense lesion in the pancreatic body, possibly a cyst versus side-branch IPMN, was also found.
MRI abdomen revealed an enlarged edematous liver with hepatomegaly and gallbladder wall edema, multiple focal hepatic lesions and innumerable focal lesions in the spleen.
and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, suggestive of a lymphoproliferative disorder.
An US-guided biopsy of the liver was performed, with preliminary results concerning for lymphoma vs. hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
Cytology revealed atypical cells of undetermined significance.
ID and Heme/Onc were consulted, and they recommended that empiric antibiotic therapy be discontinued given that liver biopsy was consistent with malignant process.
Heme/Onc began allopurinol for uric acid production prophylaxis and dexamethasone was started with daily surveillance of tumor lysis labs.
#Liver/Splenic hypodensities: While in the MICU, the liver and splenic hypodensities were most suspicious for malignancy of lymphoma or mets (likely primary would be from prostate/pancreas).
Also possible were small abscesses given fever and acute sx.
IR-guided percutaneous biopsy revealed grey zone lymphoma of the liver.
#Altered Mental Status: Pt exhibited acute confusion which seems to be far from his baseline.
Also question of acute intracranial process as he did have transient difficulty with language.
Also possible AMS is secondary to hyponatremia, however this level is not extremely low.
#Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: No signs of bleeding or melena.
In the setting of acute illness.
No clinical splenomegaly.
Coags not concerning .Likely related to infectious/malignancy process above.
Likely he was hypovolemic and also vasodilated in the setting of fever.
On the Floors Medicine/BMT:  # Hodgkins Lymphoma:  Pt was found to have stage IV Hodgkins lymphoma with involvement of the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and likely subcarinal lymph nodes.
Both percutaneous biopsy of the liver and BM biopsies were obtained, which revealed lymphoma with characteristics intermediate between large B cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma.
Given the prescence of [**Doctor Last Name 8260**]-Sternberg cells in the bone marrow this is most consistent with Hodgkins lymphoma.
Due to his liver enzymes being elevated he was first started on dexamethasone for treatment of the lymphoma.
BEACOPP was initated on [**2173-7-16**], holding adriamycin and procarbazine due to persistently elevated LFTs.
Pt received reduced dosage chemotherapy and on [**2173-7-18**] Tbili was down to 2.6 so  procarbazine and adriamycin were added at a reduced dosage.
# Anisocoria: In addition on the floors pt experienced new onset anisocoria  L pupil > R pupil which was concerning for CNS lymphoma.
No change in mental status.
A MRI of the head with and without contrast did not reveal any intracranial lymphoma.
In addition, pt does not have any other focal neurologic deficits.
# Liver/Splenic hypodensities- PT presented to the hospital with fatigue and weakness.
His labs revealed transaminitis and elevated bilirubin.
Follow-up CT scan of the abdomen revealed lesions on the liver and spleen along with retroperitoneal LAD, which were concerning for either malignancy (lymphoma vs. mets) vs. infectious.
Once on the floor, he was sent for a biopsy of the livery lesion, the initial read of which revealed lymphocytic infiltration concerning for lymphoma vs. lymphophagocytic histiocytosis.
After liver and BM biopsy confirmed lymphoma, he was stopped on all antibiotics, and started on allopurinol for ppx against elevated uric acid, and 40mg IV dexamethasone QD with [**Hospital1 **] tumor lysis labs.
#Pancytopenia-No signs of bleeding or melena.
Anemia without thrombocytopenia.
In the setting of acute illness.
No clinical splenomegaly.
Likely related to malignancy process and secondary to chemotherapy.
Had high fever in the setting of vague weakness, slight jaundice, and hepatic lesions.
This was likely secondary to malignancy as other etiologies on differential including autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, and lower biliary process were ruled out.
Also possible is acute HIV.
#Upper extremity swelling: On night of [**2173-7-18**] pt noticed swelling of left upper extremity where PICC line is in place, not associated with pain or erythema.
Duplex ultrasound showed no evidence of upper extremity DVT.
Currently no pain or erythema around PICC line, and swelling decreased this AM.
PICC site should be monitored for signs of infection, erythema, warmth.
#Transaminitis/hyperbilirubinemia: Secondary to hepatocellular injury/cholestasis due to lymphoma involvement of the liver.
#Hyperglycemia: Blood glucose has been mildly elevated since starting steroids.
Pt was on low dose ISS for hyperglycemia (BG>150).
No need for insulin at home given only mild elevation of glucose on steroids.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # Depression - on citalopram at home.
Mood improved until diagnosis of lymphoma was made.
