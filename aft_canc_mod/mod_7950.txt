Admission Date:  [**2130-7-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-7-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2062-11-30**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**] Chief Complaint: Headaches x 1 week  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2130-7-28**]: Right parietal craniotomy for tumor resection   History of Present Illness: This is a 67 year old female with 55 year history of smoking 1 pack of cigarettes a day who presents with a week of headaches and difficulty "putting thoughts together".
A head ct was performed consistent with significant right hemispheric edema and possible right sided brain mass.
There was a chest xray that was consistent with a possible mass in the left lower lobe.
The patient denies weakness, numbness, tingling, vision or hearing deficit, bowel or bladder dysfunction, nausea or vomiting.
She states that she is not followed by a primary care physician and has no prior medical history.
Family History: Denies family history of malignancy.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Pertinent Results: [**2130-7-23**] MRI Head Right parietal mass in the subcortical region with extensive surrounding edema with the appearance most suggestive of metastatic disease.
The post-gadolinium images are motion degraded and no obvious other lesions are seen.
No acute infarcts.
Left lower lobe superior segment mass and a smaller left lower lobe spiculated-appearing lesion may represent synchronous or metachronous bronchogenic carcinomas or metastases in the proper clinical setting.
Metastatic necrotic-appearing lymph nodes in the right paratracheal region.
Right lower lobe superior segment 4 mm nodule likely represents a small metastasis.
No lytic, blastic or aggressive-appearing osseous lesions are appreciated.
There is again seen a fracture involving the distal radius with intra-articular extension.
Images of the forearm do not show any injury of the proximal radius or ulna.
[**2130-7-25**] chest Xray: FINDINGS: In comparison with the outside study of [**7-22**], there is little overall change in the appearance of the large left lower lung mass laterally consistent with the opacification seen on the CT that was felt to represent both a left lower lobe superior segment and left lower lobe mass representing either bronchogenic carcinoma or metastases.
[**2130-7-26**] L wrist xray: IMPRESSION: Nondisplaced distal radial fracture with largely unchanged from prior study.
Degenerative changes at 1st CMC and IP joints.
Minimal blood within the surgical bed.
Expected amount of pneumocephalus is seen.
Persistent edema unchanged from before.
[**2130-7-29**] MRI BRAIN: IMPRESSION: No evidence of residual mass in the right parietal surgical bed.
An MRI was obtained and this showed an enhancing R parietal mass with surrounding vasogenic edema.
A CT torso was obtained for further metastatic workup that demonstrated bilateral lung lesions, two in the left lower lobe and one small lesion in the right lower lobe, as well as necrotizing right paratracheal nodes.
Neuro-oncology, radiation oncology, hematology/oncology and Thoracic surgery were consulted due to her metastatic disease.
Final tissue pathology is pending thus final recommendations from these teams are pending.
Orthopedics was consulted for a known left forearm fracture and she was recasted on [**7-25**] and she will be non-weight bearing in Left upper extremity.
For a left 5th toe fracture she was put in a Hard-sole shoe, weight bearing as tolerated.
Post operative CT revealed no hemorrhage, moderate post op pneumocephalus and moderate edema.
She remained in the ICU for monitoring and was transferred to the floor on [**7-29**].
Disp:*60 Capsule(s)* Refills:*2* 2. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Disp:*90 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Right parietal brain mass Cerebral edema Bilateral lung masses Left wrist fracture Left 5th toe fracture   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
