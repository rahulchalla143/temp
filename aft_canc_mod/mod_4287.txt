She denied speech difficulty or leg weakness.
She has chronic HA, c/o HA today similar to her typical temporal arteritis HA.
She denies numbness, no nausea/vomiting, no visual disturbances, no seizures.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Strength full power [**4-10**] throughout with trace weakness of right deltoid and bicep.

A small hyperdense focus is noted at the left superolateral margin of the air-filled surgical cavity with a subarachnoid component (2:23-25), representing post-operative hemorrhage.
Residual regional vasogenic edema is noted, similar in extent to the previous study.
There is no shift of normally-midline structures.
Cortical atrophy is again noted, likely related to the patient's age.
Vascular calcification of the carotid siphons is also seen.
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
IMPRESSION: Small hemorrhagic focus at the margin of the new surgical cavity, with blood in the immediately suprajacent subarachnoid space, consistent with small amount of post-operative bleeding.
Attention should be paid to this finding on subsequent f/u studies.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2115-11-5**] 1:02 PM FINDINGS: There is a left parietal craniotomy.
In the left parietal surgical bed, there is a 4.7 cm hyperdensity consistent with acute hemorrhage, markedly increased in size since the prior study.
There is compression of the body of the left lateral ventricle, which is also new compared to prior.
Left frontal and parietal white matter hypodensity with mass effect is grossly stable in extent, related to the resected tumor.
There is a mucous retention cyst in the right posterior ethmoid air cells.
IMPRESSION: Markedly increased hematoma in the left parietal surgical site.

Final Report CLINICAL INDICATION: 72-year-old female with postoperative intracranial hemorrhage, now difficult to arouse.
There has been slight reduction in the amount of pneumocephalus.
The hyperdense focus of hemorrhage continues to measure 4.7 cm, similar to most recent prior.
There is slightly increased hypodensity within the posterior portion of the hemorrhage, consistent with evolving hematoma.
Mild tenting of the falx to the right is again seen.
There is persistent compression of the body of the left lateral ventricle.
Left frontoparietal white matter hypodensity with mass effect is similar in distribution.
Mucosal thickening in the right posterior ethmoid air cell is again seen.
She underwent the Left Craniotomy and awoke from anesthesia without complication.
Post op day # 1 the pt had slight difficulty with word finding.
It demonstrated new hemorrhage into the postoperative bed.
She was now more lethargic with minimal command following.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.

Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
