Admission Date:  [**2129-3-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-3-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2060-11-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Flomax / Bactrim  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory Failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation Hemodialysis with catheter placement Central line placement  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 69629**] is a 68 yo M w/PMHx sx for multiple myeloma (diagnosed [**2-23**]), s/p CVA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation who presents with respiratory distress, initially presenting with 3 days of cough with sputum production with fevers to 103 to [**Hospital6 **].
At [**Hospital3 **], he was felt to be in pulmonary edema and he received lasix 40 mg IV and was started on a nitro gtt for BPs 200s/130s, and was given ceftriaxone and azithromycin and then given levofloxacin and vancomycin in our ED.
During that admission, he had an episode of AF with RVR, with an echo showing atrial dilatation.

IMAGING  CT head [**3-19**] IMPRESSION: No evidence for intracranial hemorrhage or bleed.
The extra- axial collections mentioned on the prior CT are either prominent CSF spaces secondary to atrophy, or less likely hygromas.
CXR [**3-4**] The right lung opacity has slightly worsened in the interim as well as there is interval development of new left predominantly perihilar but also lower lobe opacity, findings consistent with superimposed pulmonary edema in addition to known multifocal parenchymal consolidations.
A small right pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
IMPRESSION: Interval development of volume overload in addition to multifocal consolidations.
No evidence for hemorrhage.
Evidence for chronic small vessel microischemic changes is stable.
Extensive sinus disease within the frontal, maxillary and sphenoid sinuses as well as the mastoid air cells.
Low density bifrontal fluid collections may represent prominent extra- axial CSF spaces in a patient with age-related atrophy versus subdural hygromas.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No hydronephrosis detected.
[**Month/Day/Year 2793**] cortical appearance similar to that of recent comparison 10 days previous with mild thinning of the cortex and echogenicity consistent with chronic [**Month/Day/Year **] insufficiency.
Abdominal X-ray [**2129-3-6**]: Dilated loops of small bowel.
Partial vs. early complete obstruction or ileus is not excluded.
No definite evidence of free air however assessment for free air is limited on this single supine radiograph.
FINDINGS: There is no short interval change from [**2127-3-16**].
There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures.
The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are unremarkable aside from mildly enlarged bifrontal CSF spaces secondary to mild brain atrophy.
Mild periventricular white matter hypodensities are the sequelae of chronic small vessel infarction, and note is made of a right lacunar infarct.
The osseous structures are unremarkable and the visualized paranasal sinuses again demonstrate near complete opacification of the sphenoid sinuses that may be secondary to recent intubation.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for intracranial hemorrhage or bleed.
The extra- axial collections mentioned on the prior CT are either prominent CSF spaces secondary to atrophy, or less likely hygromas.
DIRECT INFLUENZA A ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2129-3-12**]):       Negative for Influenza A viral antigen.
DIRECT INFLUENZA B ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2129-3-12**]):       NEGATIVE FOR INFLUENZA B VIRAL ANTIGEN.
Respiratory failure: Likely due to multiple pulmonary infections (influenza, PJP, pneumococcus) with contribution from pulmonary edema in setting of hypertension.
Required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.
Initial extubation attempt complicated by severe HTN with systolics to the 200's and ischemic changes on EKG.
Septic shock Likely due to pulmonary infections.
Pneumocystic jirovecci infection Three weeks of treatment recommended by infectious disease consult, last day [**2129-3-28**].
Initially treated with bactrim and steriods, but developed pancytopenia with concern that bactrim could be responsible -- however patient had recently received cytoxan, was on cefepime, and had multiple active infections.
Pneumococcal pneumonia Pneumococcus found on sputum culture.
Acute on chronic [**Month/Day/Year **] failure, dialysis dependent Chronic [**Month/Day/Year **] failure secondary to multiple myeloma with baseline creatinine of 3.
Acute [**Month/Day/Year **] failure thought to be secondary to septic shock, initially treated with CVVH and subsequently with hemodialysis.
Patient to likely need chronic hemodialysis.
Atrial fibrillation On admission on metoprolol 50mg po tid, held due to septic shock.
Atrial fibrillation resolved but then recurred following extubation.
Anticoagulation started with IV heparin which was subsequently discontinued due to development of GI bleed.
Gastrointestinal bleeding Patient had heme positive stools early in admission but resolved with stable hematocrit.
Of note, he had a history of gastritis and colon adenoma on EGD performed [**2124**] for workup for Fe deficiency anemia.
He developed grossly bloody stools following start of heparin.
Anemia, acute on chronic Chronic secondary to multiple myeloma, worsened in setting of GI bleeding required RBC transfusion.
Hypertension Initially hypotensive in septic shock, developed hypertension during extubation to systolic pressures of 200's.
Multiple myeloma Received dose of IVIg x1 given multipe active infections.
He will follow up in oncology clinic for further management of his myeloma.
Dysphagia Required nasogastric tube placement following extubation.
He did have some crusted lesions on his lips which initially raised the question of HSV infection, so a lumbar puncture was performed which was negative for bacterial infection.
Upon further review it was thought that this lip lesions were likely secondary to trauma rather than HSV.
CT head done prior to lumbar puncture showed no new bleed or stroke, although there was a question of bifrontal fluid collections possibly consistent with hygromas versus age-related atrophy.
His confusion increased on [**3-19**] so repeat CT head was done, upon review bifrontal collections noted on initial CT were read as being more likely due to atrophy than hygroma.
Demand Ischemia: Patient had ST depressions in setting of extubation and again during episodes of AFib with RVR.
CKs only mildly elevated with negative MB fraction.
Ileus Abdominal imaging perfored due to distended belly, films most consistent with ileus, resolved post extubation.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for sleeplessness.
