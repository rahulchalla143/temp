Excision of retroperitoneal tumor greater than 10 cm in size.
History of Present Illness: This is a delightful 51-year-old lady who is totally healthy.
A mass was picked up by her PCP in her abdomen.
The lady had had many years of vague right back pain, however, no other symptoms were in play.
The CAT scan was obtained and there was a huge tumor in the retroperitoneum abutting the pancreas, the liver, the colon and the duodenum as well as the kidney.
I met with Ms. [**Known lastname 111240**] and her family and indicated that she had a malignancy suggestive of either a sarcoma or a lymphoma.
Also in play was the possibility of this being a GI stromal tumor arising from the pancreatic and duodenal head.
I discussed the rationale for proceeding with a large open exploration and attempted resection of this mass  Past Medical History: UC, ^lipids, hypoTH, LBP, osteopenia  Social History: No tobacco No EtOH  Family History: Colorectal CA - sister Liposarcoma - mother  Physical Exam: AVSS GEN: NAD, A+O x3 HEENT: WNL, PERRLA CV; RRR, No M/R/G Pulm: CTAB Abd: no scar, soft/NT, large palpable mass to RUQ   Pertinent Results: [**2137-3-18**] 04:20AM BLOOD WBC-4.9 RBC-3.49* Hgb-9.5* Hct-26.9* MCV-77* MCH-27.1 MCHC-35.2* RDW-13.9 Plt Ct-185 [**2137-3-16**] 02:03PM BLOOD Hct-23.7* [**2137-3-16**] 03:40AM BLOOD WBC-8.7 RBC-3.23* Hgb-8.8* Hct-25.4* MCV-79* MCH-27.1 MCHC-34.5 RDW-13.0 Plt Ct-172 [**2137-3-15**] 02:45AM BLOOD WBC-11.7* RBC-3.79* Hgb-10.1* Hct-29.2* MCV-77* MCH-26.6* MCHC-34.5 RDW-13.0 Plt Ct-232 [**2137-3-16**] 03:40AM BLOOD PT-14.0* PTT-53.4* INR(PT)-1.2* [**2137-3-18**] 04:20AM BLOOD Glucose-92 UreaN-9 Creat-0.7 Na-140 K-3.9 Cl-107 HCO3-28 AnGap-9 [**2137-3-17**] 04:40AM BLOOD Glucose-75 UreaN-11 Creat-0.7 Na-138 K-3.5 Cl-104 HCO3-26 AnGap-12 [**2137-3-16**] 03:40AM BLOOD ALT-36 AST-77* LD(LDH)-219 AlkPhos-44 Amylase-42 TotBili-0.5 [**2137-3-18**] 04:20AM BLOOD Calcium-7.9* Phos-1.6* Mg-1.6 .
