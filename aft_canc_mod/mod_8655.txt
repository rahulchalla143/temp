No hepatosplenomegally, no masses.
Rectal: + hemorrhoids, no bleeding, erythema Back: no CVA tenderness, no spinal tenderness on palpation Ext: no cyanosis, clubbing, edema Neuro: A & O x 2 (date/time wrong), lethargic Skin: No rashes.
CXR [**8-4**]: No acute cardiopulmonary process (though reticular nodular pattern appreciated).
KUB [**2152-8-4**]: No free air under diaphragm, normal bowel.
ECG [**8-4**]: Sinus tach (142); axis, intervals NL, no acute ST-T changes.
No evidence of abscess in the neck.
Large bilateral pleural effusions with dependent densities, presumably atelectasis, although underlying pneumonia is not entirely excluded.
CXR [**8-9**]: Low lung volumes following tracheal extubation probably exaggerate persistent mild pulmonary edema, and the radiodensity of the moderate right pleural effusion, but azygous distention indicates persistent volume overload even though heart size is normal.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: Briefly, Ms. [**Known lastname 47716**] is a 49 year old woman with stage I infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast who presented to the ED with perirectal pain since [**8-2**] and fever to 102.
She attributed her rectal pain to hemorrhoids, but was severe enough to require Percocet.
She also noted crampy abdominal pain and decreased appetite.
In the ED, she received ceftazidime and Neupogen, but then developed progressive hypotension with systolic pressures in the 90's with tachycardia 120's-130's.
She was transferred to the ICU and labs revealed neutropenia (ANC 150).
Surgery was consulted, but determined that she had no peritoneal signs and her partially thrombosed external hemorrhoid was likely not responsible for her symptoms.
Blood cultures grew 4/4 bottles of Group A strep, and she was started on clindamycin and penicillin for concern for TSS.
She developed respiratory distress after receiving fluid and was eventually intubated on [**8-8**].
