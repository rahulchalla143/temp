The underlying rhythm is probably atrial fibrillation  [**2123-11-8**]:  KUB   IMPRESSION: Essentially unchanged air filled loops of large and small bowel, representing unchanged ileus  CXR [**2123-10-8**] IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
No anginal type symptoms reported.
Nuclear report filed separately  IMPRESSION: Abnormal study.
There is a moderate fixed defect of the inferior wall with associated hypokinesis, a moderate reversible defect of the inferolateral wall, and a new partially reversible defect of the anterior wall.
The LAD had mild lumenal irregularities with small caliber branch vessels.
The LCx was a  co-dominant vessel with minor irregularities.
The RCA had mild disease.
Stomach, antrum, biopsy (A): Focal superficial iron deposition in the lamina propria, consistent with iron pill gastropathy (confirmed on iron stain).
There was no blood proximal to this.
(endoclip) Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to 30cm from anal verge  FLEXIBLE SIGMOIDOSCOPY [**2123-10-21**] Impression: Post-Polypectomy site with friable mucosa but no stigmata of recent bleeding.
(injection, endoclip) Prior endoclipped site (clipped on [**2123-10-18**]) appeared clean without any friable mucosa, stigmata or recent bleeding, or active bleeding.
Clinical correlation with point tenderness recommended.
Multiple distended loops of bowel concerning for bowel obstruction or ileus  ECHO:  [**2123-10-25**]:  Suboptimal image quality.The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-50 %).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2122-4-29**], no definite change.
If indicated, a TEE would better assess for endocarditis  [**2123-11-10**]:  Current lab work:   Hematology   COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT WBC RBC Hgb Hct MCV MCH MCHC RDW Plt Ct [**2123-11-10**] 05:30    8.4 2.56* 7.4* 22.7* 89 29.0 32.8 16.2* 404   DIFFERENTIAL Neuts Bands Lymphs Monos Eos Baso Atyps Metas Myelos NRBC [**2123-11-2**] 05:40    80* 2 11* 6 0 0 0 1* 0 1*   RED CELL MORPHOLOGY Hypochr Anisocy Poiklo Macrocy Microcy Polychr Ovalocy Tear Dr [**MD Number(4) **] [**Name (STitle) **] [**2123-11-2**] 05:40    1+ NORMAL NORMAL NORMAL NORMAL NORMAL    BASIC COAGULATION (PT, PTT, PLT, INR) PT PTT Plt Smr Plt Ct INR(PT) [**2123-11-10**] 05:30          404 [**2123-11-10**] 05:30    33.0* 33.9     3.3*   LAB USE ONLY [**2123-11-10**] 05:30  Chemistry   RENAL & GLUCOSE Glucose UreaN Creat Na K Cl HCO3 AnGap [**2123-11-10**] 05:30    91 28* 1.4* 131* 4.2 95* 27 13  Using this patient's age, gender, and serum creatinine value of 1.0, Estimated GFR = 73 if non African-American (mL/min/1.73 m2) Estimated GFR = >75 if African-American (mL/min/1.73 m2) For comparison, mean GFR for age group 70+ is 75 (mL/min/1.73 m2) GFR<60 = Chronic Kidney Disease, GFR<15 = Kidney Failure  [**2123-11-8**]:  IMPRESSION: Essentially unchanged air filled loops of large and small bowel, representing unchanged ileus.
Brief Hospital Course:   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74y/o gentleman with h/o mitral and aortic valve replacements [**1-12**] rheumatic heart disease, A fib s/p ablation and BiV pacer, systolic CHF (EF 40%), HTN, HLD, COPD, CKD baseline Cr 1.6, obesity who presented with epigastric/chest pain and abnormal stress test.
His cardiac cath showed no disease requiring intervention.
He had a subsequent GI bleed requiring blood transfusions, 2 flexible sigmoidoscopies to place clips to the polypectomy site.
His course was further complicated by leukocytosis/fever, hypotension, as well as ileus vs obstruction.
CXR for NG tube placement suggested free air under the right diaphragm.
He was taken to the Operating Room on [**10-25**] for repair of his perforated simoid colon.
His post-operative pain was managed with dilaudid.
He is tolerating a regular diet and his pain is well controlled.
His stoma is slightly necrotic superficially and has some circumferial separation with a yellow wound bed and friable tissue.
The Ostomy nurse has been following him on a regular basis and attempting to teach his wife ostomy care as Mr. [**Known lastname **] is unable to do it due to his large pannus.
His abdominal wound became cellulitic on post op day 7 without any drainage and Vancomycin was started without any improvement.
After 2 days the lower pole of the incision was opened up and packed with minimal drainage.
A VAC dressing was eventually applied [**2123-11-5**] and his cellulitis resolved after the wound was opened.
He developed urinary retention on [**2123-11-3**] and had his Foley catheter replaced.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] continues to expel some bloody drainage from his rectal hematoma and his hematocrit has been in the 23-25 range since [**2123-10-28**].

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Chest pain/abnormal stress test Diagnostic colonoscopy secondary to strep bovis bacteremia Perforated sigmoid colon, submucosal hematoma.
Right anterior epistaxis Wound infection Acute blood loss anemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - needs assistance   Discharge Instructions: You came to the ER because of abdominal/chest discomfort and you were admitted to the Cardiology floor because of an abnormal stress test.
You underwent cardiac catheterization and were found to have no heart vessel blockages that needed to be opened.
Your pain may have been related to acid reflux.
After the procedure, you had problems with severe lower abdominal pain, bleeding from your rectum and fever.
You went to the operating room on [**10-25**] where you were found to have a perforated sigmoid colon.
You underwent a colostomy and drainage of a rectal hematoma.
You are now preparing for discharge with the following instructions:  Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner or return to the Emergency Department for any of the following:  *You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or tightness.
*New or worsening cough, shortness of breath, or wheeze.
*If you are vomiting and cannot keep down fluids or your medications.
*You are getting dehydrated due to continued vomiting, diarrhea, or other reasons.
Signs of dehydration include dry mouth, rapid heartbeat, or feeling dizzy or faint when standing.
*You may see blood or dark/black material from your rectum over the next few weeks.
That is from the rectal hematoma which is liquifying and draining.
*Your pain in not improving within 8-12 hours or is not gone within 24 hours.
Call or return immediately if your pain is getting worse or changes location or moving to your chest or back.
*You have shaking chills, or fever greater than 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius.
