[**2117-3-20**] Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 91948**] is a 75yo male with unremarkable PMH who presents today for evaluation after a screening CXR revealed a new 4-5cm mass in the right lower lobe.
He denies any symptoms currently, specifically denying cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, weight loss, chest pain, or fever/chills.
Ofnote, on a PET CT, there was an incidental finding of a 6-cm abdominal aortic aneurysm for which he will undergo repair after this hospitalization.

No pulmonary embolus detected to the subsegmental levels.
No aortic dissection.
Complete mucus impaction of the right middle lobe bronchus, with resulting right middle lobe collapse.
A small collection of air and fluid may be a small consolidation.
Left focal consolidations and ground-glass opacities throughout the left upper and lower lobes, compatible with multifocal pneumonia or aspiration.
Reexpansion pulmonary edema within the right upper lobe.
Mild post-surgical air and fluid within the right pleural cavity.
Extensive subcutaneous emphysema extending along the right chest wall and lower right neck, as seen on prior radiographs.
Slightly improved right lung aeration, but persistent moderate asymmetric edema is unusual for this long postoperative course.
Unchanged moderate right pleural effusion.
Improved subcutaneous emphysema overlying the right chest wall.
Small residual right basilar pneumothorax   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) **] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the Operating Room where he underwent a right VATS with right lower lobectomy.
He maintained stable hemodynamics after fluid resuscitation and his pain was in adequate control.
He has a chest CTA done to rule out PE which was negative but he had right middle lobe collapse due to secretions.
He was transferred to the SICU for close observation and vigorous pulmonary toilet.
He eventually required bronchoscopy and lavage to remove his secretions and following that was able to maintain saturations in the 94% range on 2.5 to 3 liters.
He remained afebrile and his WBC gradually decreased from 15K to 10K.
He has an effective cough and continues to use his incentive spirometer.
Due to his prolonged hospitalization he was evaluated by the Physical Therapy service due to his prolonged oxygen needs as well as his limited mobility.
