Admission Date:  [**2158-4-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-4-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2097-10-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5608**] Chief Complaint: SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bronchoscopy intubation  History of Present Illness: This is a 60 year old male with Lung CA in right hilum with mets to adrenals who is transfered from [**Location (un) **] for PTX managment.
One week ago, he began feeling unwell with sob and fever, started on levofloxacin and prednisone 40mg daily for bronchitis.
Per his wife, he did not have overt fevers but did have SOb, sputum production and night sweats.
A CTA showed no PE, but a large cavitated mass communicting with bronchus intermedius.
In the ED, he was coughing heaving and developed sudden pain in chest.
CXR showed a large PTX and a chest tube was placed, with re-expansion of his lungs.
Past Medical History: Lung CA COPD HTN BPH   Social History: long time smoker, lives with wife and children  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: General Appearance: intubated  Eyes / Conjunctiva: PERRL, + retractions  HEENT: no JVD, no LAD  RESP: diffuse rhonchi with bilateral breath sounds present, abdominal breathing with short shallow breaths, CT in place with  dressing on right side  CVS: RRR, no MRG  ABD: soft, NT/ ND  EXT: no edema  NEURO; Aox3->intubated and sedated   Pertinent Results: A single AP upright view of the chest was obtained.
There has been interval increase in size of the right-sided pneumothorax, which is now large, with complete collapse of the left lung.
There is no evidence of mediastinal shift.
Also noted is a small amount of subcutaneous air within the right chest wall.
There is a small left pleural effusion and a small amount of loculated pleural fluid noted adjacent to the right chest wall.
A probable small left pleural effusion is also identified.
Interval increase in size of right-sided pneumothorax, which is now large, with complete collapse of the left lung.
Small amount of loculated pleural fluid on the right and a probable small left pleural effusion.
His large PTX was felt likely secondary to broncho-pleural fistula from CA.
Also, he continued to have large air leak which was putting out serosangiunous fluid.
IP and thoracis were consulted and he was bronched, which revelaed a very large cavitary mass forming a large fistula to the bronchus intermedius.
A double lumen ETT was attempted as well as purposeful left mainstem intubation to help improve ventilation with minimal improvement.
In addition, the cavitary mass was noted to be infected and likely the source of his continued high fevers.
