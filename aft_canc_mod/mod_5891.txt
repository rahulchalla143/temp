He presented to the ED today with worsening shortness of breath.
He has had gradual worsening of his respiratory status over the last 4-5 months, but severe worsening over the last few days.
He reports he can walk approximately 100ft easily without SOB, which is per patient decreased from 2 weeks ago (although can't even complete a full sentence due to difficulty breathing on exam).
Also with increasing cough, non productive.
+ sensation of throat and airway being closely and not being able to take a deep breath.
He has chest pain throughout his thorax.
He also reports increasing lower extremity edema over the last few weeks.
The patient had plans to see Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] (heme-onc) on [**2149-9-15**] for medical clearence prior to debulking of his brain mass.
Last spoke with family [**2149-9-10**] regarding increased pedal edema and weeping.
Past Medical History: 1. transitional cell bladder carcinoma -- dx after hematuria in [**2144-3-1**].
He then received multiple biopsies of the bladder and resections of recurrent transitional cell carcinomas via cystoscopies on [**2145-9-8**] and [**2147-4-18**].
2. prostate cancer 3. non-small cell lung cancer - dx [**2149-1-29**]; underwent right lower lobe lobectomy 4. hit by a train in [**2099**].
Brain Mass - unclear if mets or primary brain tumor; his neurological problem began in early [**2149-8-1**] when he was running into things on the left side.
He  has imbalance and pressure-type pain in the mid-frontal region that is worsened with changes in body position.
He had an outside head MRI on [**2149-8-12**] that showed a large mass in the right occipital brain.
Family History: His mother died of liver cancer at the age of 90, while his father passed away from a stroke at age 56.
Physical Exam: Vitals - 97.3 BP 118 General - very thin, skin appears greyish, speaking in short sentences due to difficulty breathing HEENT - PERRL, MMM Neck - supple CV - RRR, no murmur appreciated Resp - scattered wheezes throughout, no crackles, decreased breath sounds in on right Abd - mildly distended, multiple healed scars, no guarding or rigidity, non-tender Ext - 4+ pitting edema b/l up to mid thigh Neuro - AAO x 3, decreased strength with left hand; difficult to assess strength in legs given gross edema  Pertinent Results: [**9-11**]: CK, Troponin negative x 3.
Interval progression of known nonsmall cell lung cancer, with endobronchial soft tissue lesions particularly in the left lower lobe and new lung nodules.
No evidence of PE or aortic dissection.
Coronary vascular calcifications.
Similar/slightly enlarged appearance of metastatic disease in mediastinum, liver, and spleen.
New permeative lesion in left scapula.
[**2149-9-11**] CXR - Evidence of lung tumor in right upper lobe area.
No evidence of additional acute parenchymal infiltrates or CHF.
Right upper lobe mass and multiple pulmonary nodules, not substantially changed.
Worsening mucoid impaction in left lower lobe and apparent new small left pleural effusion.
etiology of shortness of breath.
A CTA was negative for PE, and a negative BNP and no signs of fluid overload on imaging ruled out CHF.
Pulmonary felt that the patient may have respiratory distress secondary to mucoid plugging, but elected to complete his 7-day antibiotic regimen of levofloxacin which he had started as an outpatient.
His shortness of breath resolved the day of admission and the patient was saturating 99% on RA for the rest of his stay.
Lower extremity edema: CHF is negative, and albumin was normal.
We kept the legs elevated and used intermittant lasix to diurese the patient with mild resolution.
Per outside notes the pedal edema developed concurrently with the patient's steroids, and this was considered the most likely etiology of his edema.
4) Tachycardia - The patient was tachycardic on presentation, most likely secondary to increased work of breathing and dehydration.
His tachycardia resolved overnight.
Elevated creatinine: Patient was mildly pre-renal due to intravascular depletion.
Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for mucous production.
Quetiapine 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6-8H (every 6 to 8 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Shortness of breath 2.
Metastatic lung cancer 3.
Lower extremity edema 4.
Tachycardia 5.
