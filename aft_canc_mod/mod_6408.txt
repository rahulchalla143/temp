Acute-appearing fractures involving the superior endplate of L3 and the superior and inferior plate endplates of L4 with retropulsion of L4 fracture fragments resulting in severe stenosis of the spinal canal at this level.
No soft tissue mass is identified; however, a pathologic fracture in the appropriate clinical setting cannot be excluded.
Disc protrusion at L5-S1 resulting in moderate spinal canal narrowing at this level.
No scintigraphic evidence of osseous metastases.
Mild tracer uptake in the metaphysis of the distal right femur, the location of which could be compatible with a bone infarct or enchondroma - correlation could be made with radiographs.
Focal linear uptake in the L3 and L4 vertebral bodies is consistent with recent fractures as seen on MRI.
EEG: This is an abnormal EEG in the awake and drowsy states due to the presence of isolated and independent bitemporal epileptiform discharges.
Brief Hospital Course: 43 yom with history of Asthma, GERD, [**Last Name (un) 865**] Esophagus, Depression, Seizure disorder, Hodgkin's disease who presented to the ED with back pain and Nausea and vomiting.
EGD showed multiple ulcers.
# UGIB:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented with nausea and vomiting with coffee ground emesis.
EGD showed multiple ulcers.
# Back Pain:  MRI of the lumbar spine showed fractures of L3 and L4 with retropulsion of L4 fracture fragments, but no soft tissue mass.
Bone scan was done that did not show metastatic disease.
Patient was pain controlled with morphine, lidocaine patch, and tylenol.
# Seizure:  MRI head did not show any metastatic disease.
# Metastatic Germ Cell tumor:  An HCG checked was 19.
Outpatient Physical Therapy Please provide TLSO brace for Lumbar fracture stabalization 4.
You were also experiencing a lot of back pain and so we did an MRI of the spine that showed you have a compression fracture of L3 and L4.
** We have started on morphine for pain relief.
Do not take this while operating machinery or a motor vehicle.
We have started you on the following medications: (1) We have started sucralfate for your ulcer disease (2) We have started omeprazole for your ulcer disease (3) We have started morphine, lidocaine patch, and tylenol for pain relief (4) We have started you on Zonisamide for seizures.
You should take 100 mg (one tablet) [**12-10**] and [**12-11**], then increase the dose to 200mg (two tablets) [**12-12**], [**12-13**], [**12-14**], then 300mg (3 tablets) every night after that  If you should experience fevers, loss of consciousness, seizures, worsening back pain, or any concerning symptom please contact your physician.
