Admission Date:  [**2173-11-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-12-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-5-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**] Chief Complaint: 63-year- old female with a history of the hepatitis C virus related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma who was evaluated and found to be a suitable candidate for liver transplantation.
Right and left lobe liver biopsy.
Abdominal washout.
Re-opening of recent laparotomy.
Hepatic artery thrombectomy.
Peripancreatic and pancreatic debridement, evacuation of hematoma and temporary abdominal closure.
Left liver lobe biopsy  History of Present Illness: 63-year-old female who presented to the transplant service with end-stage liver disease and a hepatoma.
She was then taken back to the operating room and underwent AB/O incompatible liver transplantation and underwent temporary abdominal closure.
She was taken back to the operating room for a Vicryl mesh closure of the abdomen and liverbiopsy that demonstrated some mild central lobular necrosis.
Approximately 24 hours into her heparinization, she developed an upper GI bleed.
She underwent endoscopy that demonstrated some blood and old blood in the stomach but no active bleeding or ulcer.
There was what appeared to be a small duodenal diverticulum but no obvious source of upper GI hemorrhage.
Based upon our concern that the diverticulum may, in fact, have been a small ulcer, she underwent a CT scan of the abdomen which demonstrated a contrast extravasation and periduodenal air.
There is no jaundice.
No carotid bruits.
There is no thyromegaly.
Pertinent Results: Ct Scan 1/5/6 1) Extraluminal hyperdense material in the right upper quadrant posteriorly (superior peripancreatic and inferolateral peripancreatic) area most likely due to extraluminal oral contrast from proximal small bowel or duodenum.
2) Small (less than 4.5 cm transverse x 2 cm AP) collection anterior to the peripancreatic neck/body region.
3) Small splenic infarct, hypoperfusion or small infarct in the lower pole cortex of the right kidney.
4) Moderate bibasilar pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 63-year-old female who presented to the transplant service with end-stage liver disease and a hepatoma.
She was then taken back to the operating room and underwent AB/O incompatible liver transplantation and underwent temporary abdominal closure.
She was taken back to the operating room this past Friday for a Vicryl mesh closure of the abdomen and liver biopsy that demonstrated some mild central lobular necrosis.
Approximately 24 hours into her heparinization, she developed an upper GI bleed.
She underwent endoscopy that demonstrated some blood and old blood in the stomach but no active bleeding or ulcer.
There was what appeared to be a small duodenal diverticulum but no obvious source of upper GI hemorrhage.
Exploration showed intestinal contents free in the peritoneal cavity.
Hepatic artery ap reared clotted and she also had a splenic infarct.At this time, without what appeared to be a significant insult that we did not believe was survivable, namely an identified hollow visceral perforation, portal vein and hepatic artery thrombosis in the setting of a 2nd liver transplant and infected necrotic pancreas, pancreatic necrosis, we did not believe that this was a salvageable situation.Pt was made CMO after discussion with health proxy abdomen was closed and pt was transferred to ICU where She expired short after.
Discharge Medications: none  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Hepatitis C virus related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
Infected pancreatic necrosis.
Hepatic artery thrombosis.
