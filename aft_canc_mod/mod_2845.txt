PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was a 56 year old gentleman with acute myelogenous leukemia, who was transferred to the intensive care unit after developing respiratory distress.
In the intensive care unit he received treatment for pulmonary hemorrhage.
The patient had been transferred from the hematology/oncology service, where he was undergoing treatment for AML that had been refractory to several chemotherapies, and he had persistent blast pancytopenia and diffuse pulmonary process, possibly infection, and had been noted to require increased oxygen demand and developed dyspnea and tachypnea with a new left lower lobe opacity on chest x-ray.
Chest CT from [**7-16**] had shown multiple "defined pulmonary nodules slightly improved".
The differential was considered to be aspergillosis versus no cardia versus septic emboli versus PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].
In general the patient was diaphoretic and tachypneic, anxious, using accessory muscles to breathe.
Cardiovascular hyperdynamic precordia.
No rubs or gallops.
Lungs decreased breath sounds and coarse rales in the bilateral lower lobes.
Abdomen soft and nontender, nondistended.
Extremities without clubbing or cyanosis.
No calf edema.
Skin with diffuse petechiae.
LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit 24.7 on admission, decreased to 18 in the setting of chest x-ray showing new prominent alveolar left lower lobe opacity.
Upsloping ST depressions in V3 to V5, possibly related.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  For hypotension and anemia, the patient received 3 liters of normal saline boluses for hydration, 1 unit of platelets, vitamin K, Amicar for thrombocytopenia, 2 units packed red blood cells and oxygenation on 100% non- rebreather facemask.
Subsequently the patient reported feeling much better and was mildly sedated without pain, breathing comfortably after this care was delivered.
Given the gravity of the situation, the patient and his family decided to pursue comfort measures only, considering that his leukemia was not treatable, nor was the pulmonary hemorrhage with low platelets with platelets at the level of 5, down from 10.
The patient was presumed to have had an episode of acute respiratory distress with sudden onset requiring transfer to the intensive care unit, likely due to pulmonary hemorrhage secondary to thrombocytopenia with platelets less than 10.
In the event that the respiratory distress was related to underlying pulmonary infection, oxygen supplementation with a non-rebreather mask maintained oxygen saturation over 90%.
He received a blood transfusion and platelet transfusion for anemia and thrombocytopenia.
Also Amicar was started for thrombocytopenia that was severe with a platelet level of 5.
He was noted to be unresponsive and found to be breathless, pulseless and without heart tones, blood pressure or corneal reflexes.
Myelodysplastic syndrome.
Acute myelogenous leukemia.
Coronary artery disease.
Depression with memia.
Possible fungal pneumonitis.
