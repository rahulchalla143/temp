Admission Date:  [**2178-3-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-4-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2108-11-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: ORTHOPAEDICS  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3190**] Chief Complaint: Bilateral leg weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
C4-7 posterior decompression and fusion with instrumentation   History of Present Illness: The pt is a 69M with a 1 week h/o progressive leg weakness who was found to have metastatic disease to his spine.
This weakness occured after a one month h/o midline back pain with posterior leg numbness.
He initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] ED where an MRI showed a T11 compression fx with cord impingement as well as multi-level (cervical and thoracic) spinal cord masses with spinal cord narrowing and cord compression.
Of note he also passed blood clots in urine on the day prior to admission, but denies fecal incontinece.
Past Medical History: - h/o back injury in [**2171**] - residual foot drop - cataracts - seasonal allergies - prostatic disease (difficulty urinating, but no h/o prostate exam, had enlarged prostate on MRI in [**2171**]) - elevated PSA here    Social History: Lives in [**Hospital1 8**] with his wife.
No other drugs.
Family History: Father died of bladder cancer at age 82.
Mother died of dementia at age 89.
ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, no rebound/guarding.
3-/5 strength in BLE flexors with inability to lift leg off the bed.
Numbness in 1st and 2nd digits of left hand.
Also numbness on BLE from thighs downward, with most notable numbness over medial aspect of left calf and lateral aspect of left thigh.
Destructive lesion involving the C5, C6 vertebral bodies and posterior elements, with epidural extension at C6 level, causing mild spinal canal narrowing at that level.
The above findings are concerning for metastatic disease.
No pathologic fracture is identified.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: As on the virtually-concurrent (and technically adequate) enhanced MR is extensive replacement of the left lateral aspect of both the C5 and C6 vertebral bodies and their left and bilateral posterior elements, respectively, including the spinous processes and interspinous region.
Extensive associated parosseous soft tissue component completely occupies the left neural foramina at these levels, likely encroaching upon the exiting left C6, C7 and likely, C8 nerve roots.
Significanly better-demonstrated on the MR study is contiguous involvement of the left dorsolateral epidural space at the C6 level, with displacement and some compression of the spinal cord.
Finally, there is relatively well-defined luceny involving the left paramedian and central aspect of the base of dens and body of C2, with apparent focal cortical discontinuity, dorsally, but no pathologic fracture.
However, there is no convincing signal or enhancement abnormality on the MR study to specifically confirm similar marrow replacement, and this may simply represent asymmetric fat.
CXR [**2178-3-25**]: There is mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
No evidence of pleural effusions.
The lung parenchyma appears normal, there are no nodules or masses.
The right hilus is minimally enlarged as compared to the left side.
No evidence of osteodestructive lesions.
MRI C/T/L spine [**2178-3-25**]: Multifocal bone destruction, presumably representing metastatic disease, as on the prompting very recent studies, most significantly including: 1.
T7: Marked destruction of this vertebral body with replacement and expansion of its posterior elements, in combination with substantial epidural soft tissue component, severely narrows the spinal canal, compressing the spinal cord which demonstrates faint T2 hyperintensity, likely representing edema.
T11: Extensive bone destruction with central compression, but no significant angulation; slightly retropulsed dorsal cortex, in combination with epidural soft tissue, narrows the ventral canal with no frank cord compression or definite intrinsic signal abnormality.
C5-C6: Extensive bone destruction, particularly on the left, with large paraosseous soft tissue mass significantly encroaching upon the left neural foramina and likely exiting neural impingement, as detailed above.
There is also a component involving the left lateral and dorsal aspect of the spinal canal displacing and effacing the thecal sac.
Very small hydromyelic central canal of the spinal cord localized to the T5 level, which may relate to the severe compression at T7, as well as the presence of a focal disc herniation at the T3-4 level.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 80255**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] Spine Surgery Service on [**2178-3-25**] and taken to the Operating Room for thoracolumbar decompression and fusion T3-L3  The surgery was without complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU in a stable condition.
TEDs/pnemoboots were used for postoperative DVT prophylaxis.
Initial postop pain was controlled with a PCA.
Please refer to the dictated operative note for further details.
The second surgery was also without complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU in a stable condition.
He subsequently was taken back to the OR for a scheduled C4-7 posterior decompression and fusion with instrumentatiion.
On the day of discharge the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs, comfortable on oral pain control and tolerating a regular diet.
