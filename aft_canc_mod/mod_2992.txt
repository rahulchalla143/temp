pt has been apparently getting worsening headache since 15th with some photophobia and some confusion at times.
no focal neurological complaints.
no neck stiffness or photophobia.
no visual disturbances or nausea.
This apparently demonstrated extensive lesion in both hemispheres but restricted to white matter only, he was therefore referred to the ED for evaluation.
In [**Name (NI) **] pt was seen by neurology consult, onc consult and renal consult.
his only current complaint is mild headache which responded to po tylenol.
today he under went LUE uss for possible dvt which was negative.

TECHNIQUE: Pre-contrast axial and sagittal T1-weighted images were obtained,axial FLAIR, axial T2, axial magnetic susceptibility and axial diffusion-weighted sequences.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the most recent MRI dated [**2185-8-10**], there is evidence of larger pattern of vasogenic edema, involving the right temporal lobe, apparently extending at the right parahippocampal formation (4:10), the pattern of abnormal enhancement on the right temporal lobe lesion remains similar, extending at the head of the caudate nucleus on the right.
The pattern of abnormal enhancement involving the left occipitoparietal region remains stable with a new area of enhancement tracking the biopsy site, post-surgical changes are identified on the left parietal convexity consistent with a burr hole.
On the diffusion-weighted sequence, there is evidence of a heterogeneous area of high signal at the head of the caudate nucleus, which is not clearly identified on the corresponding ADC map, however, the possibility of small areas with subacute ischemia cannot be completely excluded (702:16).
There are no new areas with abnormal enhancement.
The area of abnormal enhancement on the right temporal lobe measures approximately 18.6 x 22.7 mm in size.
The area of abnormal enhancement on the head of the caudate nucleus measures approximately 9.9 x 15.3 mm and the area of abnormal enhancement on the left parietooccipital region measures approximately 32.8 x 32.5 mm in maximum dimensions.
Persistent mucosal thickening is identified on the left maxillary sinus, presumably a small mucous retention cyst.
IMPRESSION: Larger area of vasogenic edema and effacement of the sulci involving the right temporal lobe as described above, apparently extending at the right hippocampal formation, no definite uncal herniation is identified, the perimesencephalic cisterns are patent.
The pattern of enhancement in the different lesions located at the right temporal lobe, right head of the caudate nucleus and left parietooccipital regions remain stable with similar pattern of enhancement and vasogenic edema, new track of abnormal enhancement is identified in the surgical site with associated surgical changes consistent with a left parietal burr hole.
Brief Hospital Course: 63-year-old male with DM-II, HTN, CAD, CKD, non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma s/p chemotherapy (no radiation therapy),  s/p kidney transplant (on Rapamune & Prednisone) who presented with worsening HTN urgency and 2 weeks of throbbing headaches and found to have extensive bihemispheric white matter lesions on MRI (R temporal and L parieto-occipital).
#HEME/Oncology: The patient was diagnosed with B-cell lymphoma diagnosed [**1-/2185**] and is s/p 6 cycles of chemotherapy (R-[**Hospital1 **] x5, R-CHOP x1) and 2 cycles of IT ara-C with last dose given on [**2185-7-13**] per OMR.
The patient developed an acutely worsening mental status.
He was given steroids and had repeat imaging which showed worsening of mets in increased brain edema.
#Headaches: While presentation was initially concerning for hypertensive urgency, multiple lesions were found on brain MRI and thought to be the cause of his pain.
Patient was treated initially with tylenol for pain, however required IV pain medications for severe headaches.
Due to concern of worsening thrombocytopenia, sirolimus (switched to tacrolimus), bactrim and acyclovir were discontinued.
# Thrombocytopenia: HIT ab negative, concern for chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia.
# Diabetes mellitus II: Etiology of his renal failure per OMR.
Lantus dose was decreased while inpatient for hypoglycemia and was supplemented by ISS.
No chest pain, EKG with no ischemic changes on admission.
He remained asymptomatic currently in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
