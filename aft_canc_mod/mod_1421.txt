Admission Date:  [**2121-4-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-4-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2048-8-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ibuprofen / Codeine / Pulmicort / Aspirin / Erythromycin Base  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1363**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 25006**] is a 72 year old female with a history of stage IIIA carcinosarcoma of the uterus, stage I mucinous carcinoma of the ovary, rheumatoid arthritis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with aortic stenosis who presents with hypotension.
Yesterday, her VNA noted that she was hypotensive into the 80s and the patient felt lightheaded.
At the OSH ED she had erythema noted around her ankles bilaterally and low grade temps, but no leukocytosis.
She was found to be in acute renal failure with a creatinine of 2.2.
Her CXR was clear, however she was mildly hypoxemic after receiving IVF for her hypotension.
Normally, she does not have an oxygen requirement and is 96 - 97% on room air, however she was noted to be 88-89%, with ABG showing: 7.39/39/57/24 on room air.
V/Q scan and LENIs were obtained given hypoxia and were negative.
Serial troponins were also negative.
On arrival to the ICU the patient was comfortable and denied any shortness of breath.
She has had increasing bilateral lower extremity edema for the past two months.
She believes the redness in her legs came on suddenly yesterday, but does recall having similar redness in her legs toward the end of her chemotherapy several years ago.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied cough, shortness of breath.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.
Past Medical History: # History of a stage IIIA carcinosarcoma of the uterus and a stage I mucinous carcinoma of the ovary.
# Uterine duplication # Congenitally absent left kidney # Hypertension # Hypercholesterolemia # Rheumatoid arthritis # Polycythemia # Aortic stenosis # Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  Surgical: repair of deviated septum and reduction of nasal turbinates   Social History: Lives alone.
No family hx of ovarian or colon cancer.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 100.4 BP: 120/50 P: 101 R: 18 O2: 97% 2L NC General: Elderly caucasian female in no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, no LAD Lungs: Bibasilar crackles, no wheezes, or ronchi CV: Tachycardic, regular rhythm, normal S1 + S2, harsh [**5-20**] systolic murmur heard throughout.
2+ pitting edema almost to the knees bilaterally.
*********** On discharge: bibasilar crackles faint, 4/6 SEM harsh throughout precordium but most at RUSB and LUSB, 2+ pitting edema to knees b/l, shins mildly erythematous diffuse, compression stockings in place.
[**4-13**] CXR: Severe cardiac enlargement has increased, consistent with progressive cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion.
The most significant change has been the great increase in size of multiple large pulmonary nodules.
There is no good evidence for pneumonia and none for pulmonary edema, nor is pleural effusion substantial.
There is a severe resting LVOT gradient.
The aortic valve is severely thickened with significant stenosis (unable to estimate valve are due to difficulty in measuring LVOT diameter and presence of LVOT obstruction).
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Small, circumferential effusion without evidence of tamponade.
[**4-14**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia with atrial premature beats and ST-T wave abnormalities.
ST-T wave abnormalities are more prominent.
Interval progression with larger pulmonary metastases, adenopathy and new hepatic metastasis.
No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.
Mild pulmonary artery dilation with moderate pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 25006**] is a 72 year old female with stage IIIA carcinosarcoma of the uterus and a stage I mucinous carcinoma of the ovary undergoing carboplatin chemotherapy who presents with hypotension.
# Hypotension - Etiology remained unclear.
Differential diagnosis included sepsis (perhaps [**3-18**] cellulitis of LE's, but without other obvious infectious source), hypovolemia (but appeared volume overloaded on exam), CHF with 3rd spacing of volume but intravascular volume depletion, versus medication (chemotherapy) side effect.
Differential also included pericardial effusion and tamponade - ruled out by TTE.
With treatment of CHF (diuresis with one-time doses of lasix) and of cellulitis (with antibiotics), saw patient's BP improve.
Patient ambulated without lightheadedness.
# Hypoxia - Developed in OSH ED after she received IVF for her hypotension; in the setting of AS and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, likely became volume overloaded.
Other possibilites include worsening of HOCM, or worsened diffuse pulmonary metastasis as seen on CT in [**2121-2-14**] which may have further reduced pulmonary reserve.
CTA was done to rule out PE - negative for PE.
Patient ambulated without SOB and without desaturation.
# Cellulitis - Bilateral erythema and warmth of lower legs on exam.
Could be cellulitis vs. hyperemia from edema vs. reaction to chemotherapy medications (patient reports redness in legs previously when on this chemotherapy regimen).
# Acute renal failure - Baseline creatinine around 1 and 1.0 on [**4-10**].
# Tachycardic runs - appear to be SVT (narrow complex, regular, no P waves, came on/off suddenly), seen intermittently and asymptomatic.
Ruled out PE with CTA.
# Normocytic Anemia - Was 32.8 at OSH; after receiving fluids HCT has fallen further to 30.
# Thrombocytopenia - 137 down from 700 earlier.
# Asthma history?
# Hypercholesterolemia - patient no longer taking fenofibrate d/t concern for possible side effects.
# Uterine & Ovarian cancer - plan for next chemotherapy on Thursday [**4-24**], as an inpatient, due to concerns for side effects and desire for o/n monitoring.
Disp:*5 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital3 **] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Hypoxia Volume (fluid) overload Carcinosarcoma of the uterus Mucinous carcinoma of the ovary Cellulitis Hypotension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with low oxygen, low blood pressure, and leg redness/swelling.
We believe that your symptoms were due to fluid overload, so you were diuresed with lasix and your breathing (oxygen level) improved.
We ruled out a clot in the lungs, and did an echocardiogram to show that your heart function was similar to previously.
We are treating you for a skin infection of the legs, with antibiotics, and your legs are improving in terms of their redness, pain, and swelling.
On discharge, you were walking well without a need for oxygen, your blood pressure had improved/elevated, and your leg symptoms were improving.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, weight gain greater than 2 pounds, palpitations, difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, worsening leg swelling/redness/pain, lightheadedness.
