No subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 yo presented with new leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and anemia.
His hospital course was complicated by a subdural hematoma, evacuation of hematoma, respiratory arrest, intubation, febrile neutropenia and he expired on [**2146-5-21**] (see below).
Mr. [**Known lastname 85007**] was found to have AML from Bone marrow biopsy on [**5-4**].

He subsequently underwent emergent left craniotomy and evacuation of left subdural hematoma.
On [**5-9**] his vital signs reflected a new O2 requirement with 92-100/4L NC.
Patient was given 2 mg IV ativan to enable head CT, and 15 min later was found to be unresponsive and hypoxic.
Flumazenil was given with return of minimal degree of spontaneous movement.
He was transferred to the ICU for stabilization and subsequently had emergent head CT which did not show rebleed from his subdural hematoma evacuation.
It was thought that he likely aspirated during the code blue and he was treated for aspiration pneumonia with broad antibiotics.
Weaning of sedation was attempted several times, but he would become dysynchronous from the ventilator and tachypneic and hypertensive preventing the sedation from being weaned to assess his mental status.
He was extubated and his sedation and analgesia was maintained.
