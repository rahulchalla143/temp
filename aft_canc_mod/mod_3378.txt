Admission Date:  [**2145-7-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2145-7-28**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Unresponsive  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] year old female with likely advanced gallbladder carcinoma, vascular dementia, and CVA with subsequent aphasia who presents with fever and productive cough at home.
She was recently discharged directly from the ICU on [**2145-7-21**] after a one day admission for respiratory distress in the setting of 7 days of decreased PO intake, cough, and sputum production.
CXR on that admission showed trace left pleural effusion but no clear evidence of pneumonia or other acute intrathoracic process.
Her respiratory distress resolved overnight, and she was weaned off supplemental oxygen.
Her symptoms were thought to be related to possible aspiration and difficulty clearing secretions.
During her stay, she received Ceftriaxone and Levofloxacin, but was discharged off antibiotics given the lack of clear evidence for pneumonia.
Since her discharge, her daughter has noted continued altered mental status compared to prior baseline.
She reportedly spiked fevers soon after discharge and continued to have a cough and increased secretions.
Per her daughter, the patient has not had any nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or diarrhea.
She was brought to the ED today due to family concern regarding her cough and poor PO intake.
CXR showed no acute process.
Once in the ICU, she remained minimally responsive and nonverbal.
She did not appear to be in any respiratory distress or discomfort.
The events of the last few days were confirmed as above with her primary caretaker.

CXR ([**7-26**]): IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-24**] through [**2145-7-25**]: Lung volumes are lower, and heterogeneous consolidation at the right lung base and more clearly recognizable atelectasis on the left are new, explained by interval aspiration.
There is no pulmonary vascular congestion or edema.
Small right pleural effusion is likely.
No pneumothorax.

# Aspiration / Pneumonia: She is at high risk for aspiration given her mental status.
On her prior admission, it was thought that her respiratory distress was due to aspiration and difficulty clearing secretions.
Based on her CXR and rapid improvement, this was likely an aspiration pneumonitis rather than pneumonia.
She was discharged without antibiotics and spiked several subsequent fevers concerning for infection.
Given the likelihood of aspiration-associated pneumonia in the context of prior treatment with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin, she was started on antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and Zosyn.
# Leukocytosis: The most likely source of her increased leukocytosis on presentation was thought to be aspiration penumonia.
Other possible causes considered were UTI, C diff, and hepatobiliary disease secondary to her underlying presumed malignancy.
LFTs were normal, and the patient had no abdominal signs.
This is most likely due to her limited recent PO intake.
Urine lytes on admission showed osmolality 831, UNa 28, UUrea 1325, and UCr 118, with extremely low FENa 0.08% and low FEUrea 19%.
She received hydration given her combined hypovolemia and hypernatremia, and electrolytes were monitored Q6H until Na normalized.
# Altered Mental Status: She has advanced vascular dementia and multiple prior strokes.
This may be related to her current illness, but could also represent a new stepwise deterioration in her function.
She remains at high risk for aspiration given her current mental status.
# Anemia: Her baseline Hct is in the high 20s to low 30s.
Her MCV is microcytic at 73, likely due to iron deficiency or anemia of inflammation.
# Hypertension: On admission, the patient was hypertensive with BP in the 160s despite her volume depletion.
Her BP remained relatively high in the 120s-140s, with no further intervention.

You came in because you had a fever and cough at home.
A chest x-ray showed that you had a possible pneumonia and you were treated with antibiotics in case of infection.
You also had some abnormalities on your blood tests suggesting that you were very dehydrated.
