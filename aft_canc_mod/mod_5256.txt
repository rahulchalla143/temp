He had no warning signs and no associating symptoms.
The patient had no headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, double or blurry vision.
No numbness or tingling.
A CT head was obtained that showed no bleed, mass effect, or developing infarct.
A CTA head and neck showed no occlusion of the intracranial vessels.
Given the neurological deficits and his young age, the option of tPA was discussed with the patient, even though he was getting out of the time window.
The patient understood that there was an increased risk for hemorrhage given he was out of the time window.
Past Medical History: -none; has not seen an physician in years  Social History: Works as landscaper Smoking: no; EthOH: no; drug abuse: no Married: no; no children.
Family History: father stroke at age 76; DM mother  Physical Exam: VITALS: T afbebrile HR110 BP230-241/118-133 RR12  sO299 GEN: poor dentition; on stretcher; NAD HEENT: mmm; poor dentition NECK: no LAD; no carotid bruits; goiter on the R LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally HEART: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, gallops and rubs ABDOMEN: normal bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended EXTREMITIES: no clubbing, cyanosis, ecchymosis, or edema .
MENTAL STATUS: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam, normal affect.
Language: fluent; repetition: intact; Naming intact; Comprehension intact; clear dysarthria, no paraphasic errors.
Fund of knowledge normal; No Apraxia.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline, no fasciculations.
No adventitious movements, no tremor, no asterixis.
No pronator drift on R. No rebound.
No dysmetria or pastpointing.
Head CT [**7-5**]: There is a 2 mm chronic lacunar infarct within the right lentiform nucleus.
There is no evidence for intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
There is partial demonstration of what is likely a small left maxillary antral mucus-retention cyst.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE NECK AND HEAD [**7-5**]: FINDINGS:  There is no definite contour abnormality involving the cervical carotid system on either side.
No hemodynamically significant stenosis or ulceration is seen in this locale.
There is demonstration of a nearly 4 x 6 cm right thyroid lobe mass with speckled calcifications.
Intracranially, no definite sign of a hemodynamically significant stenosis or vascular occlusion is detected, again allowing for the limited analysis available at the time of this emergency study.
Also noted on the sagittal reconstructions is moderate degenerative change of the atlanto-dental interval superiorly.
Although the FLAIR images are of poor quality due to patient motion, there is slightly increased signal in this locale, consistent with a developing subacute phase of this lesion.
There is no hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures or other perceptible signal intensity abnormality within the brain parenchyma.
No overt extracranial abnormalities are seen other than demonstration of what is likely a small left maxillary antral mucous retention cyst.
CONCLUSION:  Acute/subacute area of brain infarction within the right caudate nucleus/posterior limb of internal capsule/lentiform nucleus, with other findings as noted above.
Repeat CT Head [**7-6**]: Right caudate nucleus/posterior limb of internal capsule/lentiform nucleus hypodensity, indicative of evolving infarct corresponding to the comet-shaped region of restricted diffusion on the concurrent MR.
There is no significant mass effect and no hemorrhage.
Lungs are grossly clear and there is no pleural effusion.
Mediastinal widening could be due to fat deposition, but adenopathy cannot be excluded and it should be noted that this examination does not represent a reliable way to exclude small lung nodules .
Thyroid US [**7-8**]: The right lobe of thyroid is enlarged and is of mixed echogenicity with some cystic areas and some calcification.
No evidence of any nodules in relation to the left lobe of thyroid.
Note is made of some prominent lymph nodes in the right side of the neck adjacent to the internal jugular vein.
Some further smaller nodes are identified more superiorly in the right side of the neck.
No other nodules identified.
Note also made of prominent lymph nodes in the right side of the neck.
He had no improvement in his deficits, but had no evidence of bleeding or adverse effects from the tPA.
Repeat Head CT 24 hrs after tPA administration showed no evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage.
had 0/5 strength in his L arm and leg with increased tone.
He was evaluated by Speech and Swallow who recommended a regular diet with no restrictions.
In terms of stroke work-up, pt was monitored on telemetry throughout his hospital stay with no evidence of A fib or other arrythmia.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted about pt's elevated blood glucose.
Pt's Thyroid mass was evaluted by ultrasound (see results above)  A thyroid panel was checked and showed TSH 12, T4 6.4, T3 104, free T4 0.9.
Pt's throid mass was biopsied by Radiology on [**7-11**].
was started on Metoprolol and Captopril for HTN, and both were titrate up on the floor.
Psychiatry felt that he was competent to make his own medical decisions and to participate in rehab, and had need for acute psychiatric evaluation.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right subcortical infarction (ischemic stroke) Type II Diabetes Mellitus Hypertension Thyroid mass- biopsy results pending Hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: Stable, with residual L hemiparesis (strength 0/5 in L arm and leg)   Discharge Instructions: Please take all medications as prescribed.
Please call your doctor or go to the ER if you have any worsening of the numbness or weakness in your arm or leg, any changes in your vision, any fevers, chills, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, or develop any other new symptoms that concern you.
