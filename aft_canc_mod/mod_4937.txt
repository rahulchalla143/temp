Admission Date:  [**2167-2-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2167-2-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2083-11-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**] Chief Complaint: upper GI bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP with cautery [**2167-2-7**]   History of Present Illness: 83M with AF on Coumadin, Ischemic CMP, EF 20%, recently admitted [**Date range (1) 24729**] with cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis s/p ERCP [**2-4**] with removal of CBD stone and sphincterotomy that presented to the ED today with lightheadedness and one episode of dark red blood per rectum night prior to admission, this was later complicated by PEA arrest in the ERCP suite this afternoon.
The pt originially presented to an OSH on [**2167-1-27**] for abdominal discomfort, vomiting and SSCP.
A RUQ u/s was without evicence of gallstones, no intra or extrahepatic dilation.
HIDA ([**2167-1-30**]) and showed non-opacification of the gallbladder, consitant with acute cholecystitis.
Pt then sent to [**Hospital1 18**] and on [**2167-2-4**] underwent ERCP where they extracted CBD stone and performed a sphincterotomy and sphincteroplasty  without complication.
The pt was discharged on [**2-4**] and last night had three episodes of large stools BRBPR and melanotic stools.
INR was 1.4 and he was given Vitamin K. Patient evaluated by ERCP who felt bleeding may be related to ERCP and are planning repeat ERCP.
At 3:25 at Code Blue was called in for a PEA arrest during the patients ERCP.
A meeting was held with the patients children that stated to continue to treat aggresively, however they stated that they would not wish their father to receive further chest compressions or shocks.

ABDOMEN: Distended, slightly firm in RUQ, Otherwise soft EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
No evidence of volume overload.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis/akinesis (inferior/inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis, apical akinesis/dyskinesis and hypokinesis elsewhere) (LVEF = 15-20 %).
No thrombus is seen but a left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be definitively excluded.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with probably mildly depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**2-7**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Procedure was terminated due to hypotension.
(stent placement)(injection, hemostasis) Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum .
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-30%) with regional variation (there is extensive apical akinesis with focal dyskinesis; the rest of the left ventricle is hypokinetic).
An apical mural thrombus is present.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened; there is mild mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-2-7**], an apical thrombus is now identified (may have been present before, but less well-visualized).
Renal U/S [**2167-2-12**]: ULTRASOUND IMAGES OF BILATERAL KIDNEYS AND URINARY BLADDER: Right kidney measures 10.7 cm in length.
There is no hydronephrosis.
1.7 x 1.5 x 1.6 cm solid-appearing mass in the upper pole of the right kidney as seen on US exam of [**2-3**], [**2166**].
A 0.4 cm cyst in the lower pole of the right kidney is stable, accounting for technique.
Hypoechoic lesion of the left kidney contains two components, one measuring 2.7 x 2.4 x 2.0 cm and the other measuring 5.4 x 4.7 x 5.2 cm.
This structure appeared more homogeneous and solid on prior ultrasound and currently appears more heterogeneous with layering echogenic debris, which may represent hemorrhage within the cyst.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Left renal solid mass likely represents renal cell carcinoma.
Hypoechoic lesion of the left kidney as described above can be further evaluated with an MRI or CT depending on the patient's renal function.
FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
Brief Hospital Course: 83M AF on Coumadin, CMP EF 20% s/p recent ERCP with sphincterotomy complicated by upper GI bleed, admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] s/p PEA arrest.
# Acute blood loss anemia/GI bleed: Was due to bleeding from ampulla given recent ERCP.
He did experience a hypovemic PEA arrest (see below).
His coumadin/aspirin were held in house and may consider resuming once no further bleeding and cautery healed.
# PEA Arrest likely [**3-10**] to hypovolemia from sphincteromy bleed: Occured in setting of known GIB, which occurred as a complication of ERCP.
Pt continued to have melanotic stools in the ICU, but Hct remained stable (had bumped to 41) without further transfusions on [**2166-2-8**].
# Acute Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated prior to ERCP procedure, and was extubated the same day in the ICU.
# ECG Changes: Pt with wide complex ventricular rhythm during arrest.
Cards consulted and felt "Evidence of wide complex rhythm consistent with idioventricular ventricular rhythm likely secondary to metabolic disarray and reperfusion following resuscitation.
The primary treatment for his rhythm is correction of his metabolic acidosis."
ARF: Likely secondary to hypoperfusion following hypotensive event, pt still produced 15cc/hr after event.
Urinalysis demonstrated volume depletion as well.
Renal was consulted who felt he had ATN plus volume depletion.
He urinated copious amounts.
He should have repeat chem 7 in [**4-9**] days, and nephrology evaluation if no improvement.
# Atrial [**Name (NI) **] Pt was rate controlled off B-Blocker.
Pt had episode asymptomatic NSVT on [**2-8**] and meds were restarted.
Patient appears mildly volume overloaded on [**2-8**] and was restarted on lasix, spironolactone, as well as carvedilol, amiodarone and digoxin.
# Incidental Renal Cell Carcinoma: Found on Renal U/S for work up for his ARF.
CODE STATUS: patients family does not wish the patient to receive further chest compressions or external defibrillations.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) inhalation Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 34004**] Nursing & Rehabilitation Center - [**Location (un) 14663**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute blood loss anemia/ GI bleed PEA cardiac arrest atrial fibrillation Acute on chronic systolic CHF Acute renal failure Hypertension, benign Mural Thrombus Renal Cell Carcinoma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane)   Discharge Instructions: Patient was admitted with large GI bleed after recent ERCP.
This was complicated by PEA arrest due to hypovolemia, as well as acute renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis as a result of hypotension.
His bleeding stopped with cautery during repeat ERCP.
He was also subsequently found to have a mural thrombus on echocardiogram.
However, his anticoagulation has been held until his bleeding issues resolve.
He was also found to have C. difficile infection.
Also, renal ultrasound demonstrated likely renal cell carcinoma.
Also, he will need to see a urologist regarding his renal cell carcinoma .
Should resume these medications ASAP and step-wise at discretion of PCP/Gastroenterologist once bleeding stable and cautery healed, given atrial fibrillation and mural thrombus.
