The patient has chronic fevers.
She denied a battery of constitutional symptoms including headache, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria.
Fever of unknown origin likely due to malignancy or adrenal insufficiency.
Left lower lobe collapse.
Congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction and preserved ejection fraction.
Atrial fibrillation.
Adrenal insufficiency status post bilateral adrenalectomy.
Melanoma status post excisional biopsy.
ALLERGIES:  Opiates of unclear reaction as well as to tape, where she develops a rash.
There is a well-healed scar from her meningeal resection, she has anicteric sclerae and pale conjunctivae.
