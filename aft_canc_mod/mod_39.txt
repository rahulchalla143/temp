The family also reports a productive cough, 30 lb weight loss in the last three months, shortness of breath over the last few months, worsened by exertion and increasing edema.
In the Emergency Department she subsequently became hypotensive with blood pressure of 80/49, heart rate 87 and irregular.
She was briefly placed on a Norepinephrine drip for hemodynamic instability which was later changed to a Levophed drip.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Chronic atrial fibrillation.
History of anemia and heme positive stools (previously refused colonoscopy).
History of previous pulmonary embolism in [**2141**].
History of previous stroke in [**2141**].
History of previous myocardial infarction, (undocumented in [**2144**]).
Chronic right-sided pleural effusion, first found in [**2150-11-12**].
History of multiple episodes of cellulitis.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Dry mucous membranes.
Abdominal, positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no rebound or guarding.
Extremities, no edema, severe chronic venous insufficiency/stasis dermatitis in the lower extremities, 1+ pulses bilaterally.
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 144 with left bundle branch block.
Chest x-ray showed possible interstitial edema, persistent right basilar opacity which could represent pleural thickening or effusion, possible infection process in the right lung.
New opacities in the left lung apex which were concerning for acute infection.
Repeat chest x-ray showed possible pneumonia in the lower lobes with a cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe concerning for tuberculosis.
The patient also had three cycles of induced sputums for acid fast bacillus, smear and culture.
She remained afebrile throughout her hospital course.
On hospital day #4 the patient was transferred to the Medicine Service and acid fast bacillus smear from hospital day #2 came back as moderately positive for acid fast bacilli.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Infectious disease - As noted above, repeat chest x-ray showed cavitary lesions in the left apex.
On hospital day #4 sputum [**Doctor Last Name 1770**] from hospital day #2 showed positive acid fast bacilli.
The patient completed a seven day course of Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for five days for question of aspiration pneumonia.
There were three attempts, one fluoroscopy guided, at lumbar puncture to evaluate for meningeal tuberculosis but were unsuccessful due to severe degenerative joint disease of the spine.
The patient remained throughout the rest of the hospital day #2, throughout hospital course and isolation in negative pressure room with respiratory precautions.
Sputum on hospital day #15 was positive for acid fast bacilli and she thus remamined in isolation.
Pulmonary - The patient's initial acute respiratory acidosis was corrected with resolution of hypoventilation secondary to carbon dioxide retention and dehydration.
The patient denied shortness of breath throughout.
She was positive for productive cough.
The patient did have an episode of somnolence when supplemental oxygen was turned up secondary to carbon dioxide retention.
Effusion consistent with a transudative process.
Cultures were at this time still pending and both pleural effusions were negative for malignant cells.
Cardiovascular - As noted above, the patient was in rapid atrial fibrillation initially.
The patient was found to have a troponin leak.
It is thought that the high troponin and CKs were secondary to myocardial damage suffered through heat stroke.
Echocardiogram on hospital day #4 showed right atrium markedly dilated, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, severe global ventricular hypokinesis, severely depressed left ventricular systolic function and pulmonary hypertension.
There was a question of a marantic endocarditis versus degenerative changes on the aortic valve.
There was no significant aortic valve stenosis, no aortic regurgitation.
Prior to previous report of [**2141-8-12**], there was no significant change in regards to left ventricular function.
On hospital day #2 the patient underwent repeat echocardiogram which again showed left atrium moderately dilated, right atrium markedly dilated with left ventricular wall thickness normal.
There was mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation and again this could not rule out marantic endocarditis though echogenic density is noted on aortic cusps and were consistent with degenerative changes.
The patient was subsequently evaluated for infective endocarditis by blood cultures times three and computerized tomography scan of the head looking for signs of emboli.
We have very low suspicion for infective endocarditis.
Heme - Coumadin was held secondary to supertherapeutic INR.
She arrived with mild prerenal azotemia, diuretics were held.
During the hospital course she required several boluses for low urine output.
This was following swallow and nutrition evaluations for malnutrition.
Asymptomatic hypercalcemia was noted, because of the low setting of albumin 2.4.
Free calcium was noted to be 1.4, free calcium on discharge was noted to be 1.9.
Neurological - Change in mental status secondary to heat stroke/malnutrition.
Gastrointestinal - The patient has a history of heme positive stools with refusal of colonoscopy.
She had intermittent guaiac positive stools while in-house.
She was seen by Gastrointestinal Service for possible occult malignancy versus tuberculosis colitis.
Colonoscopy was performed on hospital day #20 which showed diverticulosis and two polyps in the right colon that were subsequently removed and biopsied.
Liver function tests were followed q. two weeks secondary to antituberculosis medications.
The hyperclcemia was likely due to granulomatous disease (TB) and improved with treatment of the TB.
X-ray of the pelvis showed no fractures.
Prophylaxis - The with Zantac for stomach, heparin for deep vein thrombosis and fall and aspiration precautions were maintained throughout the hospital stay.
prn constipation 15.
6 hours prn pain 19.
4-6 hours prn fever/pain  It is recommended that Coumadin be restarted on [**8-6**] at 5 mg p.o.
Bilateral pleural effusions 3.  atrial fibrillation 4.
