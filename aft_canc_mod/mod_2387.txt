Myocardial infarction in '[**09**] 3.
Hypertension 4.
Hypothyroidism 6.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease 7.
Hypercholesterolemia 8.
TURBT's in '[**13**] and '[**15**]  ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.
IMAGING:  Preoperative electrocardiogram showed left atrial abnormalities with Q-waves in 2, 4, AVF, V5, V6.
Thallium stress test done preoperatively showed normal heart rate, normal blood pressure, normal respirations, no acute electrocardiogram changes, some portal V-function from an old infarction prior myocardial infarction, however it was clear for the operation.
His chest films revealed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
The patient returned to the Operating Room on [**2121-7-8**] for an exploratory laparotomy and excision of an infarcted neobladder and resection of a nonviable segment of small bowel x2, creation of a jejunal conduit.
His postop course was equally stormy with spiking fevers, renal failure, and BP instability A third surgical exploration was necessary on [**7-26**].
He also developed extensive DVT requiring anticoagulation.
His history of depression leaves on Paxil and he was started on such.
Showed a stable appearance, considering no definitive evidence of any type of abscess.
He is alert, however he is unable to move secondary to his wasting and being in bed for so long without assistance.
Neurologically, the patient has no acute issues upon discharge.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient is status post myocardial infarction in [**2109**] and he did not have a myocardial infarction during the course of his stay in-house at the hospital and he was ruled out by enzymes with no acute electrocardiogram changes.
The patient has no acute cardiovascular issues.
The patient had been on pressors immediately because of sepsis which was weaned off slowly during the course of his stay.
RESPIRATORY:  The patient had poor respiratory failure and required full respiratory support.
The patient was also bronched on [**8-22**] and mucous plugs were removed from the patient.
A CT done on this patient in the last two weeks in the middle of [**Month (only) **] showed that he had no acute pulmonary process with possible left lower lobe pneumonia.
Upon discharge, the patient has no acute pulmonary process and his lungs are sounding remarkably clearer.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient is not able to eat on his own and has a left Dobbhoff tube and is suffering from short--gut syndrome requiring B12 injections.
The patient is currently tolerating his tube feeds of Impact at goal rate of 90 cc an hour and is having some stool output.
The patient is receiving all his feeds through tube feeds and is not a candidate for a PEG given his previous abdominal surgery.
The patient's other gastrointestinal issues are obviously evolving around the reception as previously stated of massive portions of his small bowel, as well as the large bowel and appendix.
Upon discharge, there are no acute discharge issues for this patient.
GENITOURINARY:  The pathology report from the original surgery showed a high grade invasive TCC involving the bladder neck, prostate, urethral margin and regional nodes.
His right ureter is tied off secondary to the leak and he has a right nephrostomy tube which was changed on [**9-16**] as well as his left nephrostomy tube.
The patient has been showing yeast growing from the left side nephrostomy and ureterostomies almost to his Intensive Care Unit stay, but no evidence of acutely febrile as a result most likely due to colonization.
The patient has a left nephrostomy tube in addition to the ureterostomy of the left side and does not have a Foley inserted into his neobladder obviously because of drainage from that point of view.
His tubes are draining clear urine and there is no blood present.
Some blood may be noted in the urine with positional changes on the patient and that is completely normal as long as it is consistent with old blood and no massive bleeds.
EXTREMITIES:  The patient was found to have a lower extremity deep venous thrombosis on [**8-3**], as well as [**8-8**] which found upper extremity bilateral deep venous thromboses.
The patient basically had deep venous thromboses x4 and was started on a heparin drip continuously to resolve his deep venous thromboses and heparin drip was continued until Coumadin was started in the last two weeks of [**Month (only) **] prior to his discharge.
An ultrasound of the upper extremities done on Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 39315**] on [**9-12**], showed that he resolved his upper extremity clots completely with the exception of some small residual clot at the left and right IJ.
Since then, his hematocrit has remained stable at around 29 to 28 with no acute signs of bleeding.
As far as his renal function, the patient has been increasing sodium and has been given free water to resolve that.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was febrile postoperative and several cultures were sent out.
He failed to grow anything however fluconazole was continued until [**9-2**] to rule out any other type of infection and to make sure that there was no acute yeast systemic process going on even though he had colonized his tubes.
The patient became febrile again on [**9-8**] unfortunately with a T-max of 104.4??????.
Blood cultures and catheter cultures came back revealing that the patient had been infected and was handling what was later decided was probably urosepsis for Klebsiella.
The patient upon discharge is afebrile and his surveillance blood cultures have come back negative even though his nephrostomy tubes which were changed showed some fungal colonization growth.
During his stay, other cultures sent off included blood flowing through his catheter lines which were negative except for that one change which was required on [**9-8**] after he became febrile.
No significant findings.
tube feeds to prevent excessive stool, secondary to short-gut.
The patient has not been requiring any Ativan or Dilaudid or sedation as of recently.
It was felt that the patient was in early on acute renal failure which turned out to be a leak and the patient is not on renal failure, no requiring any Epogen.
for gastrointestinal prophylaxis, as well as Coumadin to keep an INR of 2 to 2.4 for prophylaxis.
It is our hope that Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) 39315**], despite his advanced cancer and multiple surgeries, will be rehabilitated and able to resume assemblance of his functional life.
We hope that he continues receiving chest PT, that he is respiratorily stable with no acute issues at this time.
