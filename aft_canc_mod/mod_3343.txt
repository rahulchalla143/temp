On [**2171-11-22**] the patient underwent a right nephrectomy with evidence of sarcomatoid features.
Repeat CT of chest revealed multiple lung metastases.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Left shoulder pain, slight rash - the patient is sensitive to tapes.
Renal cell cancer with metastasis to lung.
Hypertension on Accupril.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father with diabetes and hypercholesterolemia as well as coronary artery disease.
Family history of hypertension.
Paternal grandparents with coronary artery disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No rales, wheezes or rhonchi.
Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Right nephrectomy scar over right lateral portion of the abdomen.
Chest x-ray impression no pneumothorax, lungs clear.
Renal cell cancer:  The patient was admitted for IL-2 treatment, however, during the course of the week IL-2 treatment was stopped secondary to the complication of myocarditis.
The patient was discharged home on the 23rd without any further complications, but to follow up with his primary oncologist for further recommendations and treatment.
Myocarditis:  The patient on [**2172-1-24**] was complaining of shortness of breath and palpitations at around 10:00 at night.
IL-2 was well known to have cardiotoxicity as a side effect.
Telemetry monitoring showed several runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia with the longest run being eight beats.
During the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission the patient was noted to have two further runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
One was a five beat run of narrow complex tachycardia and the other was a seven beat run of wide complex tachycardia.
Cardiology agreed with the assessment that the patient might have sustained cardiotoxicity secondary to IL-2 treatment causing myocarditis.
No further complications noted on the last two to three days of admission.
Results were as follows; left atrium mildly dilated, right atrium moderately dilated, no atrial septal defect.
Aortic valve leaflets appeared structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
Trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mitral valve prolapse.
No pericardial effusion.
Transaminitis:  The patient developed some transaminitis likely secondary to the myocarditis in addition to some mild hepatotoxicity due to the IL-2 treatments.
Renal cell cancer metastasis.
The patient is to have a stress test by the end of next week.
