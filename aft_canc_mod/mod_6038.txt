Admission Date:  [**2117-2-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-2-18**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Percocet / Lisinopril / Zetia / [**Year/Month/Day **] / Lovastatin / Doxepin / Boniva / Gleevec / Ciprofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**] Chief Complaint: Dizziness, fatigue  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: H/P reviewed and verified.
In brief, Ms. [**Known lastname 1617**] is an 87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide and coumadin, sCHF (EF 40%), h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD, CML on Gleevec but not taking, CKD (baseline Cr 1.6), who initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
Of note, she had not been taking her Gleevec for 6 weeks because of side effects of malaise and GI discomfort.
Her hospital course was notable for starting Gleevec with more GI symptoms which caused a decrease in her WBC count.
They also discontinued dofetilide due to worsening renal failure on [**2-12**].
In the CCU, she complains of mild dyspnea at rest, palpitations.
She denies CP or light-headedness.
Electrolyte panel returned showing hypokalemia of 3.2 and hypomagnesemia of 1.7.

Periventricular white matter hypodensities consistent with [**Month/Day/Year **] small vessel ischemic changes.
Additional hypodensities noted within the basal ganglia bilaterally are likely due to old lacunar infarcts.
Prominence of the ventricles and sulci is likely due to age-related parenchymal atrophy.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
Mild calcification of the cavernous portions of both internal carotid arteries is noted.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Cholelithiasis, without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
CT Abd/Pel [**2-9**]: FINDINGS: Small bilateral pleural effusions are new on this study.
Atelectasis is also noted in the lower lung lobes.
No intrahepatic biliary dilatation is seen.
Large gallstones are seen within the gallbladder, but there is no gallbladder distention or wall thickening.
Pancreas is normal appearing showing no masses, cysts or calcifications.
In the right adrenal gland, there is a 6 x 9 mm nodule with macroscopic fat most consistent with myelolipoma.
The kidneys enhance with and excrete contrast symmetrically without evidence of masses.
The small and large intesting demonstrate no evidence of obstruction, wall thickening, or masses.
Diverticulosis without evdience of diverticulitis is seen in the sigmoid colon.
No lymphadenopathy is seen.
Severe degenerative changes are seen throughout the lumbar spine.
No lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen.
Small new bilateral pleural effusions.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
There is interval progression of vascular engorgement, upper zone redistribution of the vasculature and bilateral perihilar opacities in conjunction with increased pleural effusion, findings consistent with interval development of interstitial pulmonary edema.
No pneumothorax is demonstrated.
Brief Hospital Course: BMT COURSE:  Ms [**Known lastname 1617**] was admitted to BMT for her uncontrolled CML, as she had been off Gleevec secondary to side effects.
She described her side effects as having nausea, abdominal discomfort, and periorbital edema.
On one occasion, we tried the larger pill and she had severe abdominal pain.
We did obtain a CT scan with PO contrast to evaluate for any obstruction but no significant abnormalities were seen.
Over the course of her hospitalization on BMT, her renal function improved, and secondary to hydration, she developed pulmonary edema, presenting with orthopnea and shortness of breath.
Her dofetilide was also contraindicated at admission secondary to renal failure and was held.
She then went into a slow, sustained ventricular tachycardia on [**2-13**], during which she was asymptomatic.
Electrolyte panel returned showing hypokalemia of 3.2 and hypomagnesemia of 1.7.
The patient's v tach was thought to be triggered by electrolyte abnormalities and stopping dofetelide [**12-15**] renal failure.
On [**2117-2-15**] just past midnight, the patient developed V tach again while on amio.
Of note, pt had WBCs in urine and was started on ceftriaxone for UTI on [**2117-2-15**].
MEDICINE WARDS COURSE:  VTach: Patient had no further episodes of ventricular tachycardia.
Irbesartan was stopped secondary to renal failure on admission, and digoxin was stopped on transfer to CCU; these medications were not restarted on discharge, and should be discussed with outpatient cardiologist.
Atrial Fibrillation: As noted above, patient had stopped dofetolide and was started on amiodarone during her course in the CCU.
