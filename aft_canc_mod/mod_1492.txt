Admission Date:  [**2168-12-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-2-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2087-11-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5119**] Chief Complaint: generalized weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line placement Left craniotomy for tumor debulking under stereotactic guidance   History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known lastname 19688**] is an 81 F [**Location 7972**] with DM2, HTN, chr systolic CHF (EF 25-30%), and meningioma, who p/w increased urinary frequency, diffuse weakness, and increased lethargy per daughter.
[**Name (NI) **] daughter pt with slow decline over the past several weeks however, since two days exhibits poor interaction, generalized weakness, and poor PO intake, patient is at baseline AOx2 and currently is AOx2.
Meningioma was dx in [**11-5**] in RI where she had presented with dysphagia and UE numbness.
In the ED: EKG with NSR and LBBB (unchanged), neuro exam limited due to poor effort, nonfocal.
Past Medical History: Meningioma per MRI, no biopsy Chronic systolic CHF, EF 30% Hypertension DM2 Chronic lower extremity pain  Social History: No history of tobacco or alcohol abuse.
VS: T 98.1, BP 125/60, HR 78, RR 99%RA GEN: NAD, awake, alert, oriented to person and place, not to year/time HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, conjunctivae pale, OP dry and with thrush NECK: Supple, no JVD CV: Reg rate, normal S1, S2.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
CT Head w/o Contrast (12/28/8): IMPRESSION: Large heterogeneous left frontal extra-axial mass lesion, with coarse peripheral calcification, and mild-moderate surrounding edema and mass effect, most consistent with a meningioma.
MRI Brain w Contrast (12/29/8): CONCLUSION: Left temporal, frontal, and parietal meningioma with  calcification, cyst formation, mass effect, and edema.
No acute intracranial pathology after recent biopsy including no hemorrhage.
Unchanged heterogeneous left frontotemporoparietal extra-axial mass which has radiologic appearance of meningioma.
Post-surgical changes within the right frontotemporal region.
No acute intracranial pathology including no hemorrhage.
Unchanged heterogeneous left frontoparietal temporal extra-axial mass with radiologic appearance of a meningioma.
Resolving post-surgical changes in the right frontotemporal region.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: I agree with the above, however, there is a new, small, left frontal subdural hematoma adjacent to the floor of the anterior fossa and along the anterior falx.
This measures approximately 5mm thick at most, and there is no mass effect.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Unchanged heterogeneous left frontoparietal temporal extra-axial mass which is consistent with the reported diagnosis of invasive meningioma.
MR HEad can be considered for better assessment of tumor extent, mass effect and any small foci of infarction.
Stable postoperative changes of right frontoparietal region.
Focal areas of left renal cortical hypodensity suggestive of pyelonephritis vs. infarcts, with additional areas of bilateral renal cortical irregularity suggestive of scarring from previous infection or infarct.
Apparently thick-walled bladder is nonspecific in the setting of bladder underdistension.
Tiny hypodense hepatic lesion too small to characterize.
Left upper pole hypodense renal lesion most likely representing a caliceal diverticulum or cyst, although incompletely characterized.
RUE U/S (1/17/9): IMPRESSION: Acute thrombus along the PICC, extending from the mid basilic veins proximally into the axillary and subclavian veins.
Note:  Meningothelial tumor with severe cytologic atypia, prominent nucleoli, architectural disarray, high N/C ratio, and focal tumor necrosis.
The MIB-1 reveals a low proliferation index of approximately 1%.
EEG (2/2/9): FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: There was intermittent focal slowing seen in the left posterior quadrant with occasional sharp features.
IMPRESSION: This was an abnormal portable EEG recording due to left posterior quadrant slowing with sharp features suggestive of subcortical and maybe cortical dysfunction in this area and to the relatively slow background suggestive of a mild encephalopathy or excessive drowsiness.
INR=2.1   Brief Hospital Course: In brief, Ms [**Known lastname 19688**] is an 81yo [**Location 7979**] female with a history of type 2 DM, HTN, chronic systolic CHF (LVEF 25-30%), and atypical meningioma, who originally presented with generalized weakness, hyperglycemia, and recently diagnosed CNS mass (meningioma) with localized edema.
# Meningioma, atypical: Originally diagnosed radiologically at OSH in 11/[**2167**].
Initial CT of the head and MRI of the head showed CNS lesion with localized edema but no herniation.
The patient did not have localizing neurologic exam findings.
Pt underwent biopsy on [**2169-1-6**] and was noted to have an atypical-appearing meningioma infiltrating into the surrounding tissue.
A high degree of vascularity was noted.
On path the tissue was notable for WHO grade II atypical meningioma.
Pt has had episodes of altered mental status post-biopsy, however, no acute changes could be seen on repeat head CTs.
It was argued that her CNS edema would place her at risk for further [**Last Name (LF) 16859**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] this would be attempted at a later time.
EEG on [**1-30**] was performed to rule out seizure, some general slowing was seen consistent w drowsiness vs encephalopathy, but no seizure activity was seen.
# DVT/PE: Pt's post biopsy course was complicated by the development of DVT on her RUE at the site of the PICC.
Decision was made not to anticoagulate given risk of bleed in the peri-operative setting.
Approximately a week later the patient was noted to be tachycardic and tachypneic with a mild O2 desaturation.
A CTA was obtained and was positive for bilateral PE.
Given clinical HIT syndrome (see below), pt was anticoagulated with argatroban and warfarin.
# Thrombocytopenia, clinical HIT: 5 days after heparin SC was started the patient was noted to be thrombocytopenic and suspicion of HIT arose.
A discussion with neurosurgery took place again and  it was decided that the risk of bleeding overweighed that of VTE, because of the vascularity of the tumor and the immediate post surgery course.
Alternative causes of thrombocytopenia at this time were considered to be the H2-blockers that the patient was on.
Several hours later the patient developed thrombocytopenia and heparin was replaced with argatroban.
despite the negative blood tests, the heparin must have caused the thrombocytopenia as the platelets rapidly and significantly improved after stopping that drug.
Likely also mild iron-deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease, given low normal Fe, low TIBC, elevated ferritin.
# Klebsiella UTI: On initial evaluation she was noted to have Klebsiella bacteremia.
She was later found to have Klebsiella UTI w recurrence.
# Type 2 DM: The patient's blood glucose was difficult to control requiring aggressive insulin administration.
Acetaminophen 160 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: [**10-12**] mL PO q6h:PRN as needed for fever, pain.

You were recently found to have a brain mass while admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital.
You are going to continue dexamethasone, at decreasing dosage to treat the swelling in your brain caused by the tumor.
You developed a large clot in one of the veins in your R arm from the IV that is in place to provide antibiotics to treat your blood infection.
Please return to the ED or call your regular doctor if you experience nausea vomiting, headache, weakness, fever, abdominal pain, involuntary movements or any other symptom that concens you.
Please follow up at the [**Hospital 7975**] [**Hospital **] HEALTH CENTER for continued Diabetes and Insulin teaching on [**2169-2-8**] 10:00am.
