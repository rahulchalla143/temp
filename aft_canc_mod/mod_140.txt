Cystoscopy & retrograde ureterogram   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 29-year-old G5 P1-1-3-2 thin African-American female with a large symptomatic fibroid uterus, complaining of prolonged menometrorrhagia as well as severe pelvic pain, who presented with severe anemia with a hematocrit of 25.
The patient was being evaluated by her PCP for suspected underlying thalassemia.
Iron studies revealed severe iron-deficiency anemia, however the patient was not compliant with p.o.
Given the source of anemia was likely due to her fibroid uterus, the patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells 1 day preoperatively, as well as 125 mg of Ferrlecit IV to try to improve her iron stores and blood supply.
The risks of infection with blood transfusion, as well as the side effects of blood transfusion, were discussed with the patient at length.
Even after the patient was transfused the 2units of packed red blood cells, her post-transfusion heamtocrit was only 27 since she continued to bleed heavily from her uterine fibroids since the last HCT of 25.
Past Medical History: PMH: She states that she is otherwise healthy with the exception of this left lower extremity swelling episode, which was not painful, unclear etiology.
She has a sister who is alive and well without breast cancer.
Denies a family history of ovarian, uterine, cervical, or vaginal cancer, or colon cancer or any other cancers in the family.
Also, denies family history of diabetes, heart disease, or hypercholesterolemia.
The tissue appears healthy & there is no drainage.
There was tenderness on the right inferior margin of the wound without errythema or induration.
On post operative day 2, the pt complained of new onset LLQ pain.
On exam, the subcutaneous hematoma was stable, but the inferior wound margin had developed dark red ecchymoses.
There was tenderness at the left pole of the wound tracking superolaterally to include the left lower quadrant and left flank.
There was underlying emphysema to auscultation and crepitus with palpation.
CT was ordered confirming subcutaneous emphysema at the left pole of the wound tracking superolaterally as described above.
Additionally, there was emphysema involving the fascia on the right, beneath the hematoma.
There was no odor or purulence.
There was no evidence of ongoing bleeding.
Inspection of the abdomen revealed no evidence of intra-abdominal injury or bowel injury.
No signs of necrotizing fasciitis was identified.
However, there was no significant blood loss in the initial Abd SCH nor the re-operation to suggest a pre-renal causes of the ATN.
CT urogram [**2166-10-19**] showed no hydronephrosis bilaterally; normal R ureter, no extravasation; but in L ureter, dye did not pass past superior portion of ureter, no extravasation; no ureteral pulsation seen in 9 min during study.
On post-op day [**5-3**], per urology consult, retrograde cystoscopy was performed and showed no evidence of obstruction or extravasation bilaterally.
Pt was advised to return to clinic on [**2166-10-22**] to have her creatinine redrawn and evaluated, as well as a wound check.
Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor if you have nausea/vomiting, unable to keep food down, have redness, swelling, foul smelling drainage or pus from your wound site, fever/chills, vaginal bleeding that saturates greater than one pad per hour, or any other concerns that worry you.
