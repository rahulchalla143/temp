History of Present Illness: This 72M pediatrician was diagnosed with T-cell lymphoma 4 weeks  ago and is followed up by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3315**] at [**Hospital3 328**].
He subsequently developed fever and petechial rash prior to receiving his chemotherapy without infectious cause identified.
He subsequently did well in the intervening weeks after chemotherapy and went through neutropenic phase without complication.
He states that he has had a subacute shortness of breath on exertion and a dry non-productive cough since approximately 2 weeks ago.
However on friday [**10-1**] pt developed a fever to 101.6 along with maculopapular rash over his trunk and legs as well as a mild cough.
He was given levofloxacin empirically for possible pneumonia and his fever came down on [**10-2**].
He subsequently developed nausea and mucositis associated with chemo and was treated with zantac.
Sunday [**10-3**], pt developed progressive malaise and fatigue and was seen at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital for temp of 100.8.
Initial labs notable for leukocytosis of 22K with left shift, query G-CSF effect vs infection; acute renal failure with creatinine at 2.2 (baseline 1.1); and abnormal LFT's: SGOT 94, SGPT 201, alk phos 329, TB 1.6, direct bili 1.0, lipase 13.
RUQ U/S demonstrated thickened, edematous gallbladder wall but no peri-cholecystic fluid (could be due to contracted state), but nl pancreas, liver and cbd.
There was medium amount of ascites and small pleural effusions.
CXR revealed atelectasis of RLL with interval improvement, and small bilateral effusions.
He was therefore given a dose of ertapenem in the ER for potential biliary infection.
On arrival to BMT floor pt complained of feeling fatigued, has dry mouth and feeling short of breath which is affecting his ability to speak.
On arrival to the BMT unit he was feeling progressivly short of breath and requiring supplimental O2 (O2sat 94% on 4L).

no lesions on palms/soles/oral mucosa.
A right hilar lymph node is pathologically enlarged and measures 1.9 x 1.1 cm (2:31).
There is bilateral basilar bronchovascular thickening.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis are also present.
No pulmonary nodules are identified.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Please note, lack of intravenous contrast administration limits detailed evaluation of the intra- abdominal organs.
Once again, the gallbladder wall is noted to be markedly thickened measuring 1.6 cm in maximal dimension (2:72).
A small amount of perinephric fluid is noted bilaterally.
A small amount of fluid is noted tracking in the paracolic gutters bilaterally.
There is no free air within the abdomen.
The abdominal portions of the large and small bowel appear grossly unremarkable.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Please note, lack of intravenous contrast administration limits detailed evaluation of the pelvic organs.
A moderate amount of fluid is noted to track along the paracolic gutters entering within the pelvis.
There is no evidence of diverticulitis.
The prostate is mildly enlarged measuring 5.2 x 4.8 cm (5.2 cm, transverse dimension).
There is prominent pathologic inguinal lymphadenopathy with the largest lymph node located in the right groin measuring 2.6 x 2.0 cm (2:126).
These are slightly atypical in appearance but most likely represent Schmorl's nodes.
No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified.
Extensive axillary, hilar, mediastinal, portal, and inguinal lymphadenopathy likely consistent with patient's underlying history of T-cell lymphoma.
No previous examinations are available at this time for comparison.
Thickening of the basilar bronchovascular walls could indicate an infectious or inflammatory process.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis, a focal opacity in the right lower lobe and another focus in the left upper lobe could represent focal atelectasis/inflammation versus infection/aspiration, particularly at the bases.
Highly irregular, thickened gallbladder wall without distension is better evaluated on concurrent ultrasound examination from the same date.
No additional findings on this limited non-contrast CT evaluation.
Mild bilateral perinephric fluid also noted also of unclear etiology.

ECG ([**10-6**]) - Sinus rhythm; Consider left atrial abnormality; Low limb lead QRS voltages - is nonspecific .
Although no definite pneumonia is appreciated, the area behind the heart and the elevated hemidiaphragm cannot be properly evaluated in the absence of a lateral view.
Specifically, no hilar or mediastinal adenopathy is appreciated.
No evidence of biliary dilatation.
Abnormal but nondistended gallbladder, with a 1.4 cm wall.
The imaging findings are nonspecific, and may represent edematous or infiltrative change of the wall.
Small hepatic hilar lymph nodes, mild splenomegaly.
Extensive axillary, hilar, mediastinal, portal, and inguinal lymphadenopathy likely consistent with patient's underlying history of T-cell lymphoma.
Thickening of the basilar bronchovascular walls could indicate an infectious or inflammatory process.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis, a focal opacity in the right lower lobe and another focus in the left upper lobe could represent focal atelectasis/inflammation versus infection/aspiration, particularly at the bases.
Mild bilateral perinephric fluid also noted also of unclear etiology.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 72-yo retired pediatrician with a recently diagnosed T-cell lymphoma s/p one cycle of CHOP (D+26), who presented with fever, rash, persistent dry cough, elevated LFTs, acute renal failure, and worsening oxygen requirement, transferred out of the ICU for continued care.
He was also noted to have one episode of BRBPR and multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response on exertion, which were symptomatic with palpitations and dizziness, and resolved with rest.
Fevers - The pt presented with fever, leukocytosis with left shift and bandemia, persistent non-productive cough, and worsening oxygen requirement, raising concern for a pneumonia.
CXR on admission was unremarkable, and non-contrast chest CT was also non-specific.
His hypoxia greatly improved since his admission, with resolution of his dyspnea and tachypnea, and weaned off oxygen to room air.
He defervesced and remained afebrile >72hrs, so his antibiotic regimen was changed to Meropenem and Azithromycin.
Hypoxia - The pt presented with a significant oxygen requirement, dyspnea, and tachypnea.
He was treated as above for a probable pneumonia, although all micro data was negative.
His SOB also improved with an ipratropium inhaler that had been started for mild wheezing.
h/o DVT - The patient had a history of DVT approx 4 weeks prior to this hospitalization, being treated with coumadin at home for anticoagulation.
Atrial tachycardia - The patient had an episode of A-fib with RVR in the MICU, in the setting of increased sympathetic tone with infection, fever, and dehydration.
The patient was started on Metoprolol 12.5 for ectopy noted on his telemetry, but he developed wheezing after this, so the medication was discontinued with relief of wheezing.
He was noted to have more episodes of symptomatic A-fib with RVR while on the floor, so he was started on a low-dose CCB with good control and no further events on telemetry.
BRBPR - The patient described 1 episode of BRBPR when trying to move his bowels.
His bleeding was felt to most likely be hemorrhoidal bleeding in the setting of his low platelets, but given the recent supratherapeutic INR, the GI team was consulted as other causes of bleeding such as diverticula were also being considered.
The GI team also felt that this was likely hemorrhoidal bleeding and not a more serious source given his small amount of bleeding.
The patients hematocrits stabilized prior to discharge and he had no further evidence of bleeding.
Thrombocytopenia - The patient presented with thrombocytopenia and continued decrease in platelet count throughout the admission.
Abdominal discomfort - The patient initially presented to OSH with elevated LFTs and RUQ US findings of gallbladder wall thickening, which was confirmed on RUQ US here.
The GGT on admission was not helpful as it was indicative of both bony and hepatic sources of elevated Alk Phos.
The patient's LFTs continue to trend downward without intervention, and he had only very mild discomfort on deep palpation of RUQ, without any associated symptoms.
Rash - The patient initially presented with a diffuse erythematous blanching maculopapular rash.
Initial DDx included drug rash to Levaquin, infectious, or lymphomatous involvement.
Evaluation by Dermatology advised that the rash is most likely a drug reaction to Levaquin, and it was recommended that he use topical Clobetasol for treatment.
Acute renal failure - The patient initially presented to OSH with Cr 2.2, up from baseline 1.1.
Urine lytes reportedly consistent with pre-renal picture, and Renal U/S essentially normal.
T-cell lymphoma - The patient was diagnosed with T-cell lymphoma approx 4 weeks prior to his admission, and is now s/p first cycle of CHOP (D+26).
Sepsis with Multi-Organ failure 2.
Pneumonia 3.
Thrombocytopenia 5.
Acute Liver Failure 6.
Acute Renal Failure 7.
Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response 8.
Hemorrhoidal Bleeding 9.
Drug Rash 10. history of DVT Secondary Diagnosis: - T-cell lymphoma   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, vital signs stable, off supplemental oxygen, pain-free, with resolving rash, normalizing laboratory values including platelet count, white blood cell count, LFTs, renal function tests, and INR .
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] on Monday, [**2184-10-4**], for fever, and you presented with a cough, shortness of breath, rash, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, a supratherapeutic INR, and low platelets.
You also developed hypotension likely from dehydration and/or sepsis, so you were treated in the ICU for a day, with great improvement in your clinical status.
A liver/gallbladder ultrasound showed a thickened gallbladder wall but no evidence of acute cholecystitis.
You developed multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, so you were evaluated by Cardiology and started on low-dose Cardizem (you developed wheezing on low-dose metoprolol, which was treated with an ipratropium inhaler).
You also had one episode of bloody stools, so you were evaluated by Gastroenterology, who felt that the bloody stools were likely hemorrhoidal and did not warrant further work-up at this time.
As you continued to do well, your platelet count trended back up to normal, your LFTs trended down to normal, your acute renal failure resolved with hydration, your rash resolved, your INR trended back down to a therapeutic level, and your fevers resolved and you did not require any further supplemental oxygen.
You had no further episodes of bleeding or atrial tachyarrhythmias.
You recovered nicely and were up walking around the floor well, and you were evaluated by Physical Therapy, who determined you had no acute needs at this point.
