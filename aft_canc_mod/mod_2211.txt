While doing dishes she noticed her right leg felt "floppy" and numb.
She was brought to [**Hospital3 7569**] where a CT head was performed and it was questioned the presence of a brain aneurysm as which point she was transferred.
Here MRI was notable for mild periventricular white matter changes as well as an apparent acute left thalamocapsular infarct.
Prior to transfer, she was noted to be hyperlipidemic and hypertensive and was therefore started on Atorvastatin and lisinopril.
She feels she does not have any of the original symptoms which prompted her presentation.
She has mild left sided neck pain and headache (which as been a chronic issue since [**Month (only) 958**] after she fell while hanging laundry).
She denies any recent illnesses; no fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
Past Medical History: -HTN -mitral regurgitation, -coronary disease, -hyperlipidemia, -small abdominal aortic aneurysm- followed by cardiology - s/p bilateral cataract surgery with lens replacement.

No dysarthria.
No evidence of apraxia or neglect.
Extraoccular movements intact bilaterally, no nystagmus.

Non-specific ST-T wave changes.

Left MCA bifurcating aneurysm as detailed above.
Acute infarct in the left thalamus, better seen on the MRI.
Bilateral caudate body and left lentiform nuclei chronic lacunar infarcts, as confirmed by MRI.
Findings likely representing chronic microangiopathic small vessel ischemic changes in a patient of this age.
Mild diffuse parenchymal volume loss.
Left thalamic acute infarction.
Bilateral caudate body and left lentiform nucleus chronic infarcts.
Moderate chronic microangiopathic small vessel ischemic changes.
Mild diffuse parenchymal volume loss.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2104-7-7**] at 3:44:23 PM      FINAL IMPRESSION: Very small fluttering echodensity on the right coronary leaflet as described above c/w possible fibroelastoma or fibrin strand.
The location and lack of aortic regurgitation are atypical for a vegetation/endocarditis, but this cannot be fully excluded.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 35906**] is a 78 year old right handed woman with a history of hypertension and dyslipidema who presented with sudden onset of right sided weakness, numbness and dysarthria.
THALAMIC INFARCT LIKELY DUE TO A CARDIOEMBOLIC EVENT;  MCA ANEURYSM: Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient's exam was notable for mild righ facial [**Last Name (un) **]-labial effacement with weakness on the right in an upper motor neuron fashion more proximally than distally, and decreased sensation to pinprick on the right arm and leg.
In addition, she was found to have a left sided sub-thalamic infarct.
The patient did not have any current stigmata of endocarditis however her TTE was notable for a discrete echodensity suggestive of a fibroelastoma.
There was little residual weakness on right right, although gait remained unsteady.
Because the patient had been on aspirin at the time of presentation, it was decided to switch the patient to Plavix for future stroke prevention.
HYPERTENSION/HYPERLIPIDEMIA: During this hospitalization the patient was noted to have elevated blood pressure and cholesterol.
A small abnormality was noted on the cardiac leaflet of the aortic valve.
Cardiology felt that she may have had a brief run of unreported AFib on telemetry, and recommended anticoagulation.
POSSIBLE ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: During her hospitalization, Ms. [**Known lastname 35906**] was on telemetry monitoring.
It was felt that telemetry identified a possible event of atrial fibrillation with RVR.
The natural history of unruptured aneurysms and available treatment options were discussed with the patient and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] from Neurosurgery.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 8117**] Home Health Service  Discharge Diagnosis: Left Thalamic Infarct Unruptured left MCA aneurysm Probable fibroelastoma Hypertension Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: The patient was hemodynamically stable.
Her neurologic exam was notable for a mild right arm pronator drift and a narrow based gait with shortened stride.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital3 **] for evaluation of right leg weakness and a aneurysm found on your brain.
It was felt that your aneurysm was not the cause of your symptoms and that you had separate event, a small stroke, which caused your symptoms.
During this hospitalization you were found to have elevated blood pressure and cholesterol.
Because of this, we have started you on two new medications: Lisinopril: 5mg daily (for blood pressure control) Atorvastatin: 40mg daily (for cholesterol control)  In addition, you should take the medication Plavix, which is a blood thinner, to prevent future strokes.
You were found to have a small abnormality on one of your heart valves and possibly an irregular heart rhythm.
Please call your doctor or seek immediate medical attention if you develop any new symptoms or have any concerns.
