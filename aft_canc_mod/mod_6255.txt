The shortness of breath has been associated with increased thick yellow sputum production.
He has had no fevers/chills/sweats.
He has had no chest pain.
He has no orthopnea or increase in leg swelling.
He presented to the ED today because the symptoms of shortness of breath were much worse.
He states that he saw his ENT in early [**Month (only) 205**] at which time he was told that the vocal cord mass was not present and the previously seen vocal cord paralysis was resolved.

Onchx: Initially presented after two-year history of sore throat and cough, which worsened in the fall of [**2099**].
He also developed increasing hoarseness at this time.
Flexible endoscopy on [**2100-11-4**] was notable for an immobile left hemilarynx mass invading the left false cord.
MRI on [**2100-11-13**] showed a 1.4 x 2 x 3.8 cm left anterior periglottic and supraglottic mass extending from the level of the anterior commissure to involve the left false cord and aryepiglottic fold.
There was also a 2 cm left level III lymph node.
On [**2100-11-30**], biopsy of the laryngeal tumor was notable for invasive squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated.
PET-CT on [**2101-1-13**] was notable for intensely FDG-avid laryngeal mass with an FDG-avid left-sided level III lymph node.
He also was found to have a proximal FDG-avid esophageal focus on the PET-CT.

STUDIES: [**2101-7-29**] - CTA CHEST FINDINGS: There is normal opacification of the pulmonary arteries without pulmonary embolism identified.
The aorta opacifies normally, without evidence of dissection.
There are scattered calcifications in the region of the aortic arch.
There are coronary artery calcifications.
There is no focal airspace consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.
No pulmonary nodules identified.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Limited imaging through the upper abdomen demonstrates surgical clips in the region of the gallbladder fossa, consistent with cholecystectomy.
There are severe degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.
No pulmonary embolism, or aortic dissection.
No cause for the patient's chest pain is identified.
[**2101-7-30**] - NECK SOFT TISSUES PLAIN FILMS FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-29**], there is again persistent narrowing of the trachea at approximately C6-7 level.
FINDINGS: There is a nodular appearance to the supraglottis and glottis which appears slightly progressed compared to the prior study.
Recurrent neoplasm cannot be excluded.
There is sclerosis of left arytenoid cartilage.
There is edema of the supraglottis with marked narrowing of the supraglottic lumen which measures approximately 3 mm in greatest transverse diameter.
There is questionable destruction of the anterior thyroid lamina bilaterally with possible spread of soft tissue into the strap muscles in the midline.
No definite abscess is seen.
No significant tracheal stenosis is seen.
There is mild subglottic narrowing measuring approximately 1.3 cm in AP dimensions.
There is no pathologic adenopathy by imaging criteria.
There are scattered bilateral level 2 lymph nodes which are somewhat rounded but do not meet size criteria for pathology.
There is extensive DJD in the cervical and thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: Increased nodularity of the supraglottic and glottic soft tissues with possible extension into the strap muscles through the thyroid lamina.
There is also sclerosis of the left arytenoid cartilage.
There is moderate narrowing of the supraglottic airway as described above.
MRI may be helpful for further evaluation.
There is no evidence for abscess in the neck.
There are small rounded level 2 lymph nodes which do not meet size criteria for pathology.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient presented to the emergency room for increased shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.
While the patient was begin evaluated in the emergency department the patitent was noted to have stridor, consitent with laryngeal edema.
The patient had a bronchoscopy done which showed a mass at the vicinity of the vocal chords.
