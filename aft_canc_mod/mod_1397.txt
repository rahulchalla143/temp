HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62 year old white male with an extensive past medical history significant for coronary artery disease requiring coronary artery bypass graft, history of inferior myocardial infarction, status post St. Jude valve for mitral valve prolapse in [**2169**], AICD for ventricular tachycardia, CHF with EF of 25%, history of CVA, history of ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic renal insufficiency, occluded left RA, peripheral vascular disease, history of recent lower GI bleed.
Lower GI bleed occurred in [**2172-10-8**] when during colonoscopy it was found that he had a cecal arteriovenous malformation.
He most recently had a lower GI bleed treated at [**Hospital6 3426**].
He was readmitted to [**Hospital6 33**] on [**11-28**] for pulmonary edema.
He was diuresed and his symptoms resolved.
However, during that admission he developed dark diarrhea with a slow drop in his hematocrit.
There he had two negative CKs and troponins, but he was sent to [**Hospital1 69**] for further workup of his GI bleed and further treatment.
At [**Hospital1 190**] the patient initially had no complaints.
While receiving GoLYTELY, he developed chest pain on his way to the bedside commode.
Chest pain resolved with two sublingual nitroglycerin and IV metoprolol.
He also had brown reddish appearance to his bowel movements.
He had another episode of [**8-17**] chest pain without radiation to his neck.
However, he ruled out for coronary ischemia.
He also complained of headache and flushing.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post inferior MI in [**2147**], status post coronary artery bypass graft times two in [**2169**].
Ventricular tachycardia status post dual chamber AICD in [**2167**] for ventricular tachycardia and bradycardia.
History of inducible VT with old inferior scars.
Status post multiple admissions.
CHF with EF of 25%.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy status post TURP.
History of gastritis H.pylori positive.
Ulcerative colitis diagnosed in [**2128**].
Occluded left renal artery most likely with chronic renal insufficiency with creatinine of 2.5 to 3.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Lower GI bleed which last occurred in [**2172-10-8**].
At that time he was found to have cecal arteriovenous malformation.
In general, he was in moderate distress with chest pain, but alert and oriented.
Heart regular rate and rhythm, S1 mechanical sound above apex, 2/6 systolic murmur without radiation.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities had 2 to 3+ peripheral edema, warm, no cyanosis or clubbing.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 93 beats per minute with normal axis, ST depressions and T wave inversions in aVL, 1, aVF, 2, V4, V6.
Positive for left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria.
When he became chest pain free, he had less prominent T wave inversions.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was a 62 year old white male with multiple medical problems who had a GI bleed complicated by ischemic changes on his EKG.
His chest pain, along with the EKG changes, was thought to be secondary to his anemia.
He has a history of chest pain with hematocrit decreases below 30.
However, because of his congestive heart failure and clinical evidence of pulmonary edema, the blood transfusion would have to be closely monitored.
No CKMB fractions were done on those CKs.
On the second day of admission he had chest pain after having hematochezia.
He had ST depressions on his EKG.
for afterload reduction.
His INR had initially been elevated at 2.6.
However, after he had hematochezia associated with chest pain, heparin was also discontinued.
He had been actually hypertensive with blood pressure between 140s and 200s despite probable bleeding from the GI tract.
He continued to be diuresed because of his congestive heart failure.
His edema improved gradually over time.
He was continued on heparin for his mitral valve replacement.
It was debated whether to start low molecular weight heparin.
They felt that the risk of bleeding would be low after having intervention so subsequently he was started on Coumadin 5 mg p.o.
Because of his GI bleed issues and his anemia, cardiac catheterization was deferred on this admission.
The patient had multiple episodes of hematochezia.
Because of his history of cecal AVM, it was felt that his new bleed was also related to cecal AVM.
It showed active bleeding at the cecum.
Because of his anemia he was transfused multiple units of blood.
During the procedure he was found to have a single large angiectasia that was not bleeding in the cecum.
BICAP electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully.
It was thought that his GI bleed was under control.
The patient has chronic renal insufficiency.
He may have a renal azotemia picture.
The patient was anemic and required multiple units of blood.
However, once he no longer had hematochezia his hematocrit remained stable.
Arteriovenous malformation in the cecum.
