Admission Date:  [**2160-5-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2160-5-16**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old male with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease status post left pneumonectomy for lung carcinoma with likely primary lung carcinoma on right asthma, chronic bronchitis, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation and GI bleed.
He was admitted to [**Hospital3 27946**] Hospital on [**2160-4-27**] for recurrent right pneumonia.
His course at the outside hospital was complicated by upper GI bleed, status post BICAP cautery to ulcerated gastric polyp.
He had a visible vessel and ruling in for myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes, CK 260, MB 9.1, troponin 0.96.
He had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction on presentation to [**Hospital3 27946**] Hospital with peak troponin of 3.46 on [**4-29**], CK of 306 in the setting of his GI bleed.
There was a right middle lobe infiltrate noted on chest x-ray of [**4-29**] and on [**4-30**] it was no longer seen.
On [**2160-5-6**] the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for question of cardiac catheterization as the patient described intermittent chest pain and tightness described at 4/10, worsening over the last five months, no nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, but he has had chest pain for the two days prior to admission here and increased difficulty lying flat.
Lung carcinoma status post left pneumonectomy with possible right upper lobe primary lung carcinoma.
Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, he is steroid and O2 dependent.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Coronary artery disease.
Atrial fibrillation, 4+ MR with mitral valve prolapse and an ejection fraction of 50%.
Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, without jugular venous distension.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was an 80-year-old male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer status post left pneumonectomy, transferred from an outside hospital for further evaluation of coronary artery disease, ruling in for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare:  The patient was given Solu-Medrol 80 mg IV b.i.d.
Lung mass:  The patient likely has lung carcinoma again, with his history of lung carcinoma and smoking history.
The patient also had chest CT that demonstrated the mass around his bronchus.
The patient also gave sputum samples.
Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction:  The patient's CK and troponins were trending down and the patient refused cardiac catheterization as he decided to have comfort measures only in the setting of lung cancer.
The patient was not started on heparin because of previous GI bleed that led to non-ST elevation myocardial infarction when the patient was on Lovenox.
The patient was monitored on telemetry without event.
proton pump inhibitor set and increased amylase and lipase, possible pancreatitis.
The patient reported no pain and the patient had a right upper quadrant ultrasound that showed cholelithiasis.
Ophthalmology:  The patient had home medications continued without incident.
The patient had increased white blood cells which were trending down over the hospitalization likely due to steroids.
Disposition:  The patient was seen by physical therapy and occupational therapy who helped with his movement.
Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
New lung mass.
