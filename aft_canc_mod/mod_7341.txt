Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon of mild severity.
The terminal ileum was identified and no blood was seen arising from the terminal ileum.
Old blood in the colon Grade 1 external hemorrhoids Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and terminal ileum  CT Abdomen/Pelvis: TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast axial images were acquired from the lung bases to the pelvic outlet.
Upon review of these images, it was decided that the study was nondiagnostic due to poor penetration from the patient's body habitus.
Extremely limited evaluation of the abdomen and pelvis.
No gross abnormalities evident within the liver or spleen.
No large fluid collection evident.
Air noted in the bladder, possibly due to foley instrumentation, but due to study limitations, unabel to assess for foley.
No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified.
IMPRESSION:  Nondiagnostic study despite repeated attempts with increased radiation dose.
Complex fluid collection in the left flank, little changed from [**2164**] and present since [**2161**], consistent with a chronic organized hematoma or seroma.
[**6-28**] U/S: Suboptimal study due to patient's body habitus.
Mildly distended gallbladder with multiple gallstones.
No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Extremely limited exam due to body habitus with field-of-view excluding known left flank fluid collection.
Anterior abdominal wall fluid collection without evidence of superimposed infectious process, likely represents postoperative seroma, unchanged compared to [**2165-4-25**].
Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
Extensive circumferential right lower extremity subcutaneous stranding and edema centered about the right calf, compatible with known cellulitis.
No subcutaneous gas or drainable fluid collection.
No evidence of arterial embolus in either lower extremity.
[**2165-7-9**]: BILATERAL NONINVASIVE LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS STUDY  CLINICAL INDICATION:  54-year-old male with chronic cellulitis, lower extremity pain, increased erythema.
This is a technically limited study due to body habitus, in particular the swollen legs, which limits the ability to compress venous structures.
CONCLUSION:  Technically limited study with no evidence of DVT in right or left lower extremity.
Brief Hospital Course: 54yo M with PMHx of chronic RLE pain and lymphedema, pAfib, morbid obesity s/p gastric bypass, HTN, and depression who presents with complaints of melena vs. BRBPR also found to be in atrial fibrillation.
# BRBPR: Bleeding acutely began prior to presentation.
Differential included bleeding internal hemorrhoids versus bleeding diverticulum versus colitis versus hemorrhagic infectious colitis.
He had no further episodes of large volume BRBPR.
He was prepped x 2 days for colonoscopy given h/o poor prep and overall risk associated with endoscopy given habitus.
Colonoscopy showed no clear source of bleeding, mild diverticulosis, grade 1 internal hemorrhoid, removed fecolith from appendiceal orifice.
CTA abdomen was attempted initially to localize source of bleed, but scan aborted after poor image quality with double dose radiation due to habitus.
Hematocrits remained stable and he was given PO Vitamin K for elevated INR.
Cipro/Flagyl initially started for concern for infectious colitis, stopped on hospital day #2.
#abdominal pain: evaluated by surgery, who thought that pain may be due to discomfort at point of tenderness on exam due to thin skin near area of mesh, no signs on exam of infected mesh and no new hernia on limited CT scan and MRI.
Pt was seen by ID who recommended no further intervention as patients fevers subsided and white count trended down.
Pt also states abdominal pain is improved.
Further beta blockade limited by hypotension so he was given digoxin.
Patient has had LENIs in the past that were negative.
He did have significant pain in the RLE and attempted to minimize narcotics.
Following transfer to the floor, patient notes his leg pain became acutely worse.
The patient was started back on Vancomycin on [**7-2**] with concern for MRSA cellulitis.
The patient also had a RLE CT scan to rule out nectrotizing fascitis with pain out of proportion to physical exam findings.
The patient was started on morphine and oxycodone for pain control as patient appeared in tremendous pain and said it was the worst he had ever experienced.
LENIS on [**2165-7-9**] were done [**1-24**] persistent pain which were negative.
It it felt that his right lower extremity skin changes and pain are chronic which date back many years, even to [**2153**].
He has had multiple admissions for this reason and thus after this most recent treatment for cellulitis, pain control with increased gapapentin, tylenol was initiated.
Infectious disease has seen this patient throughout his admission and were never convinced he had cellulitis.
They felt his coag neg staph in the blood was a contaminent and not related to his initial leukocytosis nor right lower extremity skin.
# HTN: Low SBPs in light of atrial fibrillation at admission.
Vitamin D 1000 UNIT PO DAILY Cholecalciferol   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 599**] Senior Healthcare of [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: GI bleed, cause uncertain, Atrial fibrillation Seconary: Right lower leg lyphedema with cellulitis,   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You came in due to blood in your stool and black stool.
Your bleeding stopped on admission.
The bleeding was most likely caused by a diverticular bleed.
In addition, you were having heart palpitations and were found to be in atrial fibrillation.
Your right leg also bothered you during this admission and the pain became increasingly worse.
You had a CT scan of the leg which showed cellulitis with no infection of the fascia.
We treated your skin infection with IV and oral antibiotics and controlled your pain.
