Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central line placed (Right IJ) Thoracosentesis 750cc (right) Lumbar Puncture Sinus exploration by ENT  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 95142**] is a very nice and sweet 64 YO woman with multiple lymphomas s/p 2 autologus stem cell transplant (see below for details) and transfusion-dependent MDS, CHF (EF 30%) who came here initially for night sweats, low-grade fever, abnormal CBC and SOB.
She had been having face pain with greenish nasal discharge for the past 3-4 weeks.
She saw an ENT who recommended saline spray; there was no improvement.
Patient states she has been having fever up to 100.8, with chills, there has been production of greenish sputum with cough associated, but has also improved since starting of antibiotics.
There has been no swelling of her legs.
LLL anthracotic nodule s/p wedge resection - bronchial metaplasia only, no malignancy identified.
Migraines with visual disturbances (?
Recurrent Shingles 6. s/p resection of LLL, as above 7.
Depression 11.
CP - diagnosis of myalgias in [**1-30**] 12.

Pneumonia [**2164**] 19: Hypogammaglobuliniemia requiring IVIG <br> She was first diagnosed in [**2144**] when she presented with a right neck mass.
In [**2147**], she underwent high dose chemo with stem cell rescue, which was successful.
She also suffered from depression and was started  on Prozac during that time.
She was doing well until [**2157**] when she was admitted for work-up of a left lower lobe mass.
LN Biopsy revealed an anthracotic node and lung wedge bx showed only patchy areas of scarring and bronchial metaplasia, with no malignancy identified in either tissue.
She presented to her PCP with [**Name Initial (PRE) **] sore throat.
In mid [**Month (only) 404**], she had  a recurrence of her shingles (treated with Valtrex; recurred on right chest, left neck).
She also saw an ENT for her sore throat  who saw a mass on her tonsillar pillar.
Biopsy revealed findings  c/w diffuse large B cell lymphoma with high-grade features, given the proliferation fraction of ~90%.
The alternative consideration of an atypical Burkitt was considered less likely given the nuclear pleomorphism and reported bcl-2 positivity.
She followed-up with her Oncologist after the biopsy was done and underwent BM bx revealing no marrow involvement.
Her course was c/b fluid overload, profound nadir and mucositis.
She had a PET scan  [**2-2**] showing marked interval decrease in FDG-avid disease within the pulmonary parenchyma and interval resolution of FDG-avid lymph-adenopathy within the neck, mediastinum, and hila.

No enlarged  mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes are identified.
Exam was not tailored to evaluate the subdiaphragmatic region, but no  substantial changes are identified in the upper abdominal region on this  limited assessment with persistent atrophy of the superior pole of the left kidney.
Within the lungs, bilateral paramediastinal areas of radiation fibrosis with associated traction bronchiectasis appear unchanged, as well as focal linear scarring adjacent to an apparent wedge resection site in the superior segment of the left lower lobe.
Atelectatic changes are present at the lung bases adjacent to the pleural effusions.
Additionally, there are new scattered thickened septal lines, predominantly in the lung bases, accompanied by mild bronchovascular thickening.
Skeletal structures demonstrate diffusely heterogeneous appearance of the patient's bones, likely related to the history of myelodysplastic syndrome.
New mild septal and bronchovascular thickening predominantly in the lower lungs, most suggestive of hydrostatic edema in the setting of enlarging pleural effusions and body wall edema.
Diffuse heterogeneity of the skeletal structures, likely related to the provided history of myelodysplastic syndrome.
Echocardiogram [**2165-9-24**]: Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF=30 %).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears loculated and is adjacent to the anterolateral and inferolateral walls of the left ventricle.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No signs of biliary obstruction.
Unchanged cholelithiasis with no secondary findings to suggest acute cholecystitis.
Enhancing lesion noted on prior CT suggestive of a hemangioma does not display son[**Name (NI) 493**] characteristics to support this diagnosis.
Differential still includes other benign liver lesions including hepatic adenoma or FNH.
MRI of the abdomen [**2165-10-2**]: There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions, which are also seen on the recent CT. Anasarca is present.
There is diffuse hypointensity in the liver, bone marrow, and spleen on the T1- and T2-weighted images, compatible with hemosiderosis.
There is a 2- mm probable cyst in the left lobe of the liver on series 1603, image 15, which is probably present on the previous MRI.
No suspicious focal liver lesions.
No evidence of biliary ductal dilatation.
The atrophy in the upper pole could be due to radiation or stenosis in an accessory renal artery.
There is very minimal atrophy in the medial upper pole of the right kidney as well, also stable.
No bulky adenopathy.
Pleural based 1 cm nodule in the right lower lobe is stable since the CT of [**2162-2-23**].
Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations delineated the dynamic series with multiple perspectives.
No focal suspicious lesions in the liver or spleen to suggest candidiasis.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
MRI head [**2165-10-2**]: There is diffuse mild pachymeningeal enhancement, which is new since the prior MR study of [**2165-4-22**].
However, this has a relatively smooth appearance, without associated nodularity or mass like appearance.
No evidence of leptomeningeal enhancement is noted on the present study.
There are scattered FLAIR hyperintense foci in the cerebral white matter on both sides, without enhancement and not significantly changed.
A vague area of enhancement in the left cerebellar hemisphere on the axial spin echo post-contrast images reflects pulsation artifacts and has no correlate on the FLAIR sequences.
There are no areas of restricted diffusion or negative abnormal susceptibility, to indicate acute infarction or hemorrhage.
Bilateral basal ganglial calcifications are noted.
There is moderately increased signal in the right maxillary sinus, along with polypoidal mucosal thickening and dense contents centrally as well as in the  sphenoid sinus and mild in the ethmoid air cells on both sides, not  significantly changed compared to the prior MR study.
There are areas of increased signal intensity in the mastoid air cells on both sides, right more than left, reflecting fluid and/or mucosal thickening.
No abnormal enhancing lesions in the brain parenchyma to suggest toxoplasma intraparenchymal lesions.
Diffuse mild pachymeningeal enhancement, which may relate to inflammation, infection, or post-LP, if performed.
No evidence of leptomeningeal enhancement.
Extensive paranasal sinus disease involving the right maxillary sinus, sphenoid, mild involving the ethmoid air cells, with dense contents.
As mentioned before, this can be due to inspissated secretions or fungal etiology, given the new compromised condition.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %) with intraventricular mechanical dyssynchrony.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
with depressed free wall contractility.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized posterior pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There is normal compressibility and flow, without evidence of DVT.
CT sinus [**2165-10-18**]: Worsening paranasal sinus opacification compared to the prior MR of [**2165-10-2**].
Dense material in the right maxillary and sphenoid sinuses could reflect inspissated secretions, however, underlying fungal infection cannot be excluded, particularly in the setting of an immunocompromised patient.
CSF Cytology/Pathology: No malignant cells seen.
Hypotension - Patient usually has had SBP in the 90's, but was as low as 70 upon admission.

However, there were no signs of tamponade or restrictive physiology.
Adrenal insuffiency was ruled out by [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim and steroid challenge.
