Due to renal insufficiency he was pre-treated with mucomyst prior to the procedure but did not receive IVF intra-procedure.
The pt denied recent unintended weight loss, fevers, night sweats, chills, headaches, dizziness or vertigo, changes in hearing or vision, including amaurosis fugax, neck stiffness, lymphadenopathy, hematemesis, coffee-ground emesis, dysphagia, odynophagia, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, steatorrhea, melena, hematochezia, cough, hemoptysis, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea on exertion, increasing lower extremity swelling, orthpnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, leg pain while walking, joint pain.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: During an outpatient work-up of fatigue and anemia, a CT and MRI  of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a moderately enlarged spleen, a solitary mass in the right lobe of the liver as well as an enhancing solid mass in the upper pole of the left kidney without vascular invasion.
Ultrasound-guided core biopsy was performed on the right lobe mass within the liver on [**2140-9-26**].
Findings were consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma noted to  be well differentiated with established cirrhosis.
The liver mass measures 7.5 cm with associated partial portal venous thrombosis at the bifurcation extending into the left portal vein.
There are some periportal lymph nodes present as large as 1.8 cm.
The left kidney mass measures 4.7 cm in greatest dimension.
Resection of the renal mass will be considered after local therapy is completed for the  HCC.
Chronic kidney disease with baseline creatinine of approximately 1.3 based on faxed records to our hospital.
Chronic thrombocytopenia diagnosed in [**2137**] followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1007**] at [**Hospital3 3583**].
History of normocytic anemia.
Acid reflux disease.
Kidney stones status post lithotripsy.
Hepatocellular carcinoma as described above, likely related  to chronic alcohol consumption in the patient's remote history.
Left kidney mass incidentally found on CT imaging in [**9-/2140**]  as above.
Family History:  Notable for Burkitt's lymphoma in his sister, breast cancer and thryoid cancer in another sister, otherwise positive for type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 95.6 BP: 167/98 P: 72 R: 18 SaO2: 94% 2L General: Sleeping but arousable to verbal and tactile stimuli, A and O x3, noted to have gaps in respiration of 3 seconds while sleeping HEENT: NCAT, PERRL, EOMI, no scleral icterus, MMM, no lesions noted in OP Neck: supple, no significant JVD or carotid bruits appreciated Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally, no wheezes, ronchi or rales Cardiac: RR, nl S1 S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated Abdomen: soft, NT, distended and tympanic throughout, no dullness to percussion, no fluid wave, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted Extremities: RIGHT groin catheter side c/d/i but small eccymosis surrounding bandage, no bruit, No edema, 2+ radial, DP pulses b/l Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
No abnormal movements noted.
Heterogeneous distribution of chemoembolization material in the distribution of the right hepatic artery.
There is increased uptake of this material within the mass occupying the right lobe of the liver.
Hyperdense mass in the superior left pole of the kidney again concerning for malignancy.
1.2-cm cystic structure adjacent to the body of the pancreas as seen previously.
CXR [**10-29**] -  As compared to the previous examination, there is a newly occurred parenchymal opacity that projects over the left hilus and is accompanied by a small pleural effusion.
No other abnormalities in the lung parenchyma.
No right-sided pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 y/o man with HCC s/p chemoembolization [**10-27**] with known renal lesions suspicous for RCC and ?
noncontrast CT liver performed Friday: Heterogeneous distribution of chemoembolization material in the distribution of the right hepatic artery.
Noted to be febrile yesterday and CXR significant for L hilar opacity.
Continues to have RUQ pain consistent with procedure.
Started on lovenox for known portal thrombosis and educated to continue as outpatient.
Initiated antibiotics to cover CAP respiratory flora, as well as bilary pathogens given recent procedure.
## Chronic renal insufficiency (baseline Cr 1.3): Cr elevated today to l.5 likely in setting of catheterization and dye load.
## Access: peripheral IV x 2 .
## Code status: FULL CODE confirmed with pt on admission  The patient was found to have free air and pneumatosis on CT scan after his procedure, he was taken to the OR on [**11-2**] for exploratory laparotomy, at that time, no compromised bowel was seen, the cecum was found to be grossly dilated, and a cecostomy tube was placed.
He had his first bowel movement postop on [**11-7**], but continued to have high NGT output.
His LFT's continued to be improved, but he required aggressive insulin therapy due to persistent hyperglycemia on TPN.
The patient was then started on a regular diet which he tolearated without complications, following which TPN was discontinued.

Discharge Condition: stable, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for scheduled chemo-embolization for hepatocellular carcinoma.
You developed a pneumonia and were started on antibiotics for 5 days.
You were also found to have a clot in your liver and were started on lovenox for blood thinning.
You underwent exploratory laparotomy and placement of a cecostomy tube for free air in your abdomen and bowel wall.
Please seek immediate medical attention if you develop GI bleeding, confusion, loss of conciousness, chest pain, shortness of breath, worsening abdominal pain, or any other change in your baseline health status.
