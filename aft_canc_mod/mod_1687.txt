No definite viral inclusion seen.
[**4-29**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis: IMPRESSION: Persistent colonic wall thickening along the ascending and transverse portions, probably more so than distally, consistent with an inflammatory or infectious causes of colitis including potentially graft versus host disease.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Mildly dilated and hypokinetic left ventricle.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
[**5-4**] CHEST CT: IMPRESSION: Multifocal bronchopneumonia, most severe in the right upper lobe.
Though this is most likely bacterial in etiology, the nodular configuration of some of the opacities also raises the possibility of fungal organisms, especially if the patient is neutropenic.
[**5-16**] CHEST CT: IMPRESSION: Resolving multifocal pneumonia with most marked improvement of the right upper lobe consolidation.
However, area of persistent opacification within the right upper lobe now demonstrates cavitations with no clear fluid collection.
Differential considerations include bacterial or fungal infection.
Color Doppler study suggests possible small interatrial shunt consistent with stretched patent foramen ovale or small atrial septal defect.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
There may be trace aortic regurgitation (better seen on study of [**2161-5-7**]).
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).
Improving multifocal infection including decreased size of cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe.
No new or worsening areas of lung or airways disease.
New small pericardial and trace pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 36-year-old man with plasma cell leukemia, d+119 after ablative (flu/cy/TBI) cord SCT, complicated by skin and gut GVHD, now on velcade (C1D32) for persistent plasma cell dyscrasia in his bone marrow, presented with erythematous eyes and dysuria.
# Red eyes: Concerning for infection vs. ocular GVHD.
He was treated empirically for chlamydia with azithromycin.
Symptomatically, he felt better about his eye discomfort by the time of discharge, and a f/u appointment was made with ophthalmology.
Of note,   Chlamydia was checked (as has GC) and both were negative.
# BRBPR: Pt developed BRBPR during hospitalization, and out of concern for GVH, flex sig was done with bxs taken.
No viral inclusions were seen on bx, and a CMV immunostain was done which was negative.
CT abd/pelvis without contrast (gvien myeloma hx showed findings c/w GVH of the colon diffusely.
Tacrolimus was stopped given concern for autonomic dysfunction and TTP.
# Plasma cell leukemia: We continued the pt's acyclovir and PO vanc for ppx.
Soon after these doses he developed autonomic dysfunction (see below) and so further treatment was held.
# Bradycardia and Orthostatic Hypotension: During the course of his treatment for cavitary pneumonia (see below) and plasma cell leukemia with Velcade/Cytoxan, the patient suddenly developed bradycardia to the 30s and 40s with concomitant, symptomatic orthostatic hypotension.
He was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for episodes of bradycardia, for which he was evaluated by cardiology service.
Echocardiogram was done that showed no evidence of structural heart disease to explain ECG or telemetry findings and he had no evidence of conduction disease.
He was also found to have orthostatic hypotension, with change in blood pressure from 195/105 when laying flat, with HR 40s, siting 139/103 HR 50-70, and standing 77/51 HR 122.
The autonomics service was consulted and his dysautonomia was thought likely to be chronic with chemotherapy induced autonomic neuropathy with velcade being the most likely cause.
GVHD was considered as he has a history of GVHD in other systems, however was thought to be very unlikely.
He should follow up with [**Hospital **] clinic for outpatient testing and in future a workup for paraneoplastic autonomic neuropathy could be considered, however this is unlikely.
# Pneumonia: The patient developed a R sided PNA in the setting of a positive MRSA blood culture during this admission.
He was treated with Vancomycin with initialy improvement, but developed cavitations in his PNA with fever and Cefepime was added.
Cefepime was stopped when the patient developed TTP (see below) but the patient remained afebrile without respiratory compromise.
# TTP: After transfer from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] back to the BMT floor, with patient developed TTP with dropping platelets, schistocytes, low haptoglobin, rising LDH and dropping fibrinogen.
The transfusion service was consulted and stated that plasma exchange was not an option given that this was unlikely to be an idiopathic antibody mediated TTP and instead more likely a result of his multiple medical problems or medications.
# RUE Clot: Patient found to have RUE clot in R arm at the time of first PICC placement; this was persistent after PICC was removed; second PICC was placed in the same arm but a different brachial vein.
The patient had some swelling in his R arm, possibly due to this clot, but was not treated with anti-coagulation due to multiple other medical issues.
Transitional Issues: - He was started on Nifedipine for hypertension and will need BP checks and dose titration - Patient will require two weeks of IV antibiotic therapy with Vancomycin (to complete [**6-16**]) - Patient will need follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] in infectious disease before completion of vancomycin.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* 4. lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for anxiety or insomnia.

Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with red eyes and pain when you urinated.
We feel that your eyes are likely dry from GVH, and that your urination was painful because of a virus called BK.
While you were here you developed blood in the stool that was concerning for graft versus host disease (GVHD).
For that reason, you had a flexible sigmoidoscopy and a CT scan which showed likely GVHD.
Finally, you were treated for a serious pneumonia while you were here.
We made many changes during your admission; please see the attached medication list to see what you should be taking.
