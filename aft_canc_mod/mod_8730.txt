A macronodular cirrhotic liver was noted.
Intraoperative ultrasound demonstrated no other lesions in the liver.
He had mild portal hypertension.the mass was removed with a margin of [**12-17**].9 cm in all directions.
Please refer to operative note for further details.
In PACU, he was hypoensive and required re-intubation for hypercarbia.
Postop, he was transferred to the SICU  for hypotension and oliguria management.
WBC was elevated at 22.7 and respiratory distress.
CXR showed increased pulmonary edema.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Nephrology was consulted for elevated creartinine (up to 1.7 from baseline 0.7).
Repeat CXRs demonstrated improved effusions and elevated right hemidiaphragm.
Low dose lasix was resumed for noted edema and bibasilar crackles.
On [**6-/2129**] he was noted to have low grade temperature of 100.6.
MODERATE GROWTH.
An abdominal CT scan was performed on [**6-24**] noting small-to-moderate ascites with no evidence for loculated intra-abdominal fluid collection to suggest abscess formation.
Diffuse superficial soft tissue stranding without evidence for drainable fluid collection and degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine as described above.
The abdomenal incision was noted to have drainage mid incision requiring dry gauze dressings.
This drainage was felt to represent fat necrosis.
LFTs increased intially, but slowly trended down.Diet was advanced and tolerated.
Incision pain was managed with po dilaudid, but he was somnolent.
Smaller intermittent doses of dilauaid were given with less sedation and improved mental status.
Moderate portal, septal and mild periseptal/lobular mononuclear inflammation, consistent with chronic viral hepatitis C (Grade 2).
Focal, mild mixed droplet steatosis with rare balloon degeneration involving <10% of the parenchyma; no definite associated hyalin seen.
Mild iron deposition, predominantly in periseptal hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, seen on iron stain.
Ipratropium-Albuterol 18-103 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: [**12-18**] Puffs Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
