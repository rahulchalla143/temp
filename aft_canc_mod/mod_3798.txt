Admission Date:  [**2198-10-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2198-12-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2140-3-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: OMED  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**] Chief Complaint: Fever and Malaise.
History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname 5655**] is a 58 year old male without significant past medical history who presented to an outside hospital with one month of fevers (up to 103), sweats, and malaise.
He also noted increasing generalized weakness and fatigue.
He had a decrease in his appetite and 13 pounds weight loss over the previous month.
He also noted easy bruising.
ROS: The patient did not have an head aches, shortness of breath, dizziness, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, epistaxis or other bleeding.
He was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of a presumptive hematologic malignancy.
[**Name2 (NI) **] had never used cigarettes or illegal drugs.
Family History: No known cancers, leukemia, or lymphoma.
NO CYANOSIS OR EDEMA.
Pertinent Results: BONE MARROW BIOPSY AND FLOW CYTOMETRY ([**2198-10-7**]): AML: Immunophenotypic findings consistent with acute myelogenous leukemia, with an immature phenotype.
There is no pneumothorax.
No pleural effusions are seen on this film, although the left costophrenic sulcus is not visualized.
Single 6-mm left upper lobe nodule.
BONE MARROW BIOPSY AND FLOW CYTOMETRY ([**2198-10-23**]): DIAGNOSIS: Persistent involvement by acute myelogenous leukemia.
Limited study of the abdomen secondary to significant patient debility as described above.
There is no intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
Extensive patchy airspace opacities throughout both lungs, which given the patient's neutropenic state could represent a diffuse widespread pneumonia, as well as alveolar hemorrhage.
ECHO ([**2198-10-26**]): 1.The LA is mildly dilated.
There is severe global LV  hypokinesis.
Overall LV systolic function is severely depressed with more marked anterior and inferior HK.
3.The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
5.The MV leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) MR is seen.
6.There is mild pHTN.
There is no pericardial effusion.
RUQ U/S ([**2198-10-28**]): IMPRESSION: No evidence of cholecystitis or dilation of intrahepatic bile ducts.
Interval development of diffuse pulmonary opacities throughout both lungs in a central distribution.
This may represent pulmonary edema or a diffuse infection.
Some areas are nodular, which may represent a superimposed fungal infection such as aspergillus.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
ECHO ([**2198-11-6**]): The LA is mildly dilated.
The LV cavity is moderately dilated with severe global HK.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the LV.
The RV cavity is mildly dilated with moderate free wall HK.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
Mild (1+) AI is seen.
There is no MV prolapse.
Mild (1+) MR is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There are diffuse multifocal alveolar opacities.
Differential includes multifocal pneumonia as well as asymmetric edema.
There are no large pleural effusions (left lateral CP angle not included).
ECHO ([**2198-11-26**]): The LA is mildly dilated.
The RV cavity is mildly dilated.
There is severe global RV free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The AV leaflets are mildly thickened.
The MV leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) MR is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2198-11-6**], biventricular systolic function now appears slightly worse.
BONE MARROW BIOPSY ([**2198-11-27**]): DIAGNOSIS - Markedly hypocellular bone marrow for age, with left-shifted granulocytic maturation and markedly decreased erythropoiesis.
Acute leukemia is not seen.
The gallbladder appears normal without evidence of stones.
There is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 5655**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] BMT service with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).
He subsequently developed severe congestive heart failure after anthracycline chemotherapy.
A bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry revealed acute myelogenous leukemia, with an immature phenotype.
As anticipated, his cell lines dropped and the patient soon became neutropenic.
He thus had neutropenic fevers early in his course (without any obvious source of infection).
Approximately two weeks after his [7+3] regimen, a bone marrow biopsy revealed persistent involvement by AML.
Re-induction chemotherapy was planned, but the patient developed an acute decline in his repiratory status: pulmonary nodules and then congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation were noted.
Upon recovery from acute congestive heart failure, the patient returned to the BMT service for re-induction chemotherapy with HIDAC (high-dose cytarabine).
He again became profoundly pancytopenic and neutropenic, developing fevers and a presumptive line infection with staph epidermidis.
However, the bone marrow was relatively acellular without evidence of leukemia.
The patient was started on G-CSF and his neutrophils and other cell lines (to a lesser degree) promptly recovered and his fevers abatted.
2) Neutropenic Fevers: As mentioned, the patient developed febrile neutropenia after his initial induction chemotherapy.
After persistence of his fevers a chest CT revealed pulmonary edema as well as bilateral nodular opacities, concerning for aspergillosis or pneumocystis gondii infections.
Late in his course, he grew staph epidermidis from four of four blood culture bottles (anaerobic and aerobic) and his Hickman line was removed.
Of note, Caspofungin was changed to Voriconazole because of rising alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin and a concern for causation; these values decreased after the change was made.
Because of concern for a pulmonary infection, a chest CT was sought, but the patient developed acute worsening of his dyspnea, oxygen desaturation and hemoptysis while on the CT scanner.
He was noted to have severe congestive heart failure by imaging.
Upon developing respiratory failure, his LVEF was 20% with global wall motion depression.
He was transferred to the ICU with severe pulmonary edema.
Thereafter, he made great progress with diuresis and held his systolic blood pressures at a level greater than 90.
4) AF/RVR: As noted, along with his new onset CHF, the patient developed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
His atrial fibrillation persisted throughout his course and he reached heart rates to the 170s early on.
Anticoagulation was not initiated because of thrombocytopenia, associated with his chemotherapy and AML.
Additionally, he had one episdoe of symptomatic NSVT of 12 beats with 3/10 chest discomfort and the sensation of a 'racing heart.'
Despite his severe heart failure, he was not deemed a candidate for a BiV/ICD given his low platlets.
6) Hyperbilirubinemia/Elevated Alk Phos: The patient had a large rise in these values early in his course, in conjunction with his severe heart failure.
The etiology early in the course may have been hepatic congestion via CHF (as there was an associated transaminitis).
Later in his course, there was no transaminits.
