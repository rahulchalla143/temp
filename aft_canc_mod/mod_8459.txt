Pt was transfused one unit [**Unit Number **] days prior to admission and he had recently stopped prednisone for coomb's positive hemolytic anemia.
Pt denies fever and chills at home.
CT at time of discharge demonstrated worsening cystic formation.
In the ED, ECG showed ST depressions in leads V4-V6.
Given CXR findings of increased perihilar haziness, and R infrahilar haziness, in conjunction with fever to 100.4 and a lactate of 3.5, he also received azithro 500mg x1, ceftriaxone 1g IV x1, and Lasix 20mg IV x 1.
After diuresis, the patient subsequently became hypotensive with decrease in SBP from 130s to 90s.
He was then given NS 250 cc with some return of SBP to 110s.
The patient did not receive a CTA to rule out a PE due to the developing acute renal failure.
The patient was evaluated by the MICU resident on night of admission for respiratory distress.
He was subsequently intubated due to hypoxia and respiratory distress.
The patient was subseqeuntly found to have bilateral PEs on CTA consistent with findings of DVT on LE dopplers.
The patient was not started on anticoagulation however given the concern for bleeding with several episodes of hemoptysis.
In addition the patient also had a presumed aspiration PNA with an as yet unisolated organism.
He had multiple cystic lesions which were concerning for infection, super infection or intrinsic lung disease and multiple bronchoscopy and BAL were unable to identify neither the infection or the underlying lung disease.
Although extubation was initially complicated by persistent secretions and poor spontaneous breathing trials, the patient was successfully extubated on [**2123-3-9**].
During his MICU course, the patient also received several blood transfusions for his Anemia and 5Q syndrome as well as multiple boluses of fluid to maintain blood pressure.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/ emphysema.
History of right-sided deep venous thrombosis.
Recent ICU stay [**Month (only) 359**] at [**Hospital1 **] for Pneumonia requiring intubation.

CXR [**2123-2-21**]: "FINDINGS: Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged with mild cardiomegaly and a tortuous and unfolded aorta.
There is increased perihilar haziness.
There is also patchy increased opacity in the right infrahilar region.
No definite effusions are identified.
There is no pneumothorax.
Increased perihilar haziness compared to the prior study may represent early CHF.
Increased right infrahilar opacity, concerning for pnemonia given the history of fever."
Bilateral LE US [**2123-2-22**]: "The veins of the right lower extremity from the groin to below the popliteal trifurcation show normal color flow, normal Doppler with augmentation and normal compressibility.
CONCLUSION: Acute DVT involving the left popliteal and anterior tibial veins.
TTE [**2123-2-23**]: "Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet  excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally  normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior  space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2121-9-9**], the rhythm is now  atrial fibrillation, and the right ventricular cavity appears larger.
Based on [**2115**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings  indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.  "
[**2123-3-1**] CTA: "1) Filling defects in the right main pulmonary artery and a left lower lobe segmental branch.
There is also necrotizing pneumonia involving the right lower lobe.
Infarction involving the right lower lobe complicated by superinfection may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.
The filling defect in the right main pulmonary artery directly abuts the dense consolidation in the right lower lobe raising the possibility of an invasive infectious process such as aspergillosis involving the right pulmonary artery.
2) Fullness of the left adrenal gland with a Houndsfield unit value of 4.5, likely representing an adrenal adenoma."

is a 75 yo male with a complicated PMHx including MDS on steroids, CHF, COPD amd recent prolonged hospitalization for respiratory distress during which he was intubated and sedated.
Directed examination revealed severe weakness of all extremities, approxiamately 1-2/5 except for triceps and wrist extensors which were 2+/5.
Sensory exam was essentially normal except for vibratory loss in the toes and [**Last Name (un) 64146**].
This study was requested to rule out a generalized myopathy.
Motor NCSs of the left ulnar nerve revealed severely reduced RA with normal conduction velocity below the elbow, mildly slowed velocity across the elbow and a mildly prolonged distal latency; F waves were unobtainable.
Motor responses of the left tibial nerve recording abductor hallicis and of the deep peroneal nerve recording extensor digitorum brevis and tibialis anterior were unobtainable.
Sensory NCS of the left median nerve revealed moderately reduced RA with normal conduction velocity.
Sensory NCS of the left ulnar nerve revealed moderately reduced RA with normal conduction velocity.
Sensory NCS of the left radial nerve revealed mildly reduced RA with normal conduction velocity.
Sensory NCS of the right sural nerve revealed moderately decreased RA with moderate slowing of conduction velocity.
There was no facilitation of the left abductor digiti minimi compound muscle action potential with 10 seconds of maximal voluntary contraction.
Concentric needle electromyography(EMG) of the left deltoid and biceps revealed early recruitment of motor units with an excess of small amplitude, short duration, polyphasic motor units; a few fibrillation potentials were noted in biceps.
EMG of the left tibialis anterior revealed early recruitment of motor units with an excess of small amplitude, short duration, polyphasic motor units without evidence of denervation.
Exam of the left vastus lateralis revealed early recruitment of markedly small amplitude, short duration, polyphasic motor units without denervation.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal study.
There is electrophysiologic evidence for a severe, generalized myopathic process with evidence for scant ongoing denervation (as can be seen in critical illness myopathy).
The findings do not suggest a pre- or post-synaptic disorder of neuromuscular transmission."

NOCARDIA CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO NOCARDIA ISOLATED.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 75yo Male with COPD, 5Q minus syndrome, Coombs positive hemolytic anemia, HTN, and CHF who presents w/ acute onset SOB, low grade fever(despite several Tylenol doses), and hypotension responsive to 250cc Bolus concerning for PNA and ?
Respiratory failure: Initially on admission to [**Hospital1 18**], the etiology of the respiratory failure was unclear.
However at time of presentation, he was found to be in profound respiratory distress and was transferred immediately to the Medical ICU.
On initial CXR, the patient was found to have a spontaneous right apical pneumothorax and infiltrate concerning for possible PNA vs. CHF.
A subsequent LE US demonstrated left popliteal DVT and the patient was started anticoagulation with a heparin gtt for presumed pulmonary embolus.
A CTA was eventually performed which confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary embolus..  Later during the course of his hospital stay, the patient developed hemoptysis and the heparin gtt was stopped.
A chest CT was not initially performed due to his hemodynamic instability.
He was intubated on [**2123-2-23**] for worsening respiratory distress.
A Bronchoscopy performed at the time was not revealing for any obvious pathology and BAL returned negative for all cultures.
During his ICU stay, he had work up for fungal process x 2.
A) Infection: Pt initially admitted with low grade fever and SOB (as well as hypotension which was responsive to fluids).
And a following CT demonstrated diffuse ground glass opacity, LLL abscess, and honeycombing.
New cystic areas were noticeable compared to [**9-9**].
Stool was found to be negative for c.diff x3, urine cultures did not result in any growth from [**2-22**] and [**2-26**], sputum grew out only sparse bacillus and was negative for yeast.
Blood cultures were also negative throughout his hospital course and the patient tested negative for galactomannan.
Although no organism grew from any source, his rapid response to antibiotics made it likely that he was infected with possible a pneumococcus (given his residence within the community, and sudden onset.
B) PE: Pt with documented bilateral PEs on CTA.
TTE on [**2-23**] demonstrated mild pulmonary HTN with EF >55%.
C) Pneumothorax: The patient was found to have right apical pneumothorax on admission CXR on [**2-21**].
The CXR was removed a week later without complication and surveillance CXR since then showed complete resolution of CXR.
D) COPD: Pt did not appear to have an acute exacerbation of his COPD.
Anemia: Pt with a history of 5Qminus syndrome (a subset of MDS with mutation leading to loss of function of epo receptor on RBC) and a history of Coomb's positive hemolytic anemia which was previously treated with decadron.
He was admitted on thalidomide for his MDS and decadron for his hemolytic anemia.
After the patient recovered from respiratory distress and was extubated successfully, he was transferred to the floor.
Recommend following CBC every two-three days to monitor for signs of blood loss.
While in the MICU, the patient was given numerous fluid boluses to maintain blood pressure and overall resulted in gross anasarca.
On transfer to the floor, he was found to have 3+ pitting edemea bilaterally in both the upper and lower extremities.
On day of discharge, the patient had significantly improved from a clinical standpoint - upper extremity edema was resolved and the patient had 1+ lower extremity edema.
The patient did have an isolated episode of hyponatremia.
This was thought to be due to hypervolemic hyponatremia given his gross anasarca.
The hyponatremia resolved with continued diuresis.
Myopathy: On transfer to the floor, the patient was found to have significant weakness - myopathy.
At the time, this was though to be due most likely to ICU myopathy vs. steroid myopathy as pt was intubated and sedated for 16 days while on chronic steroids.
The clinical findings as well as the results of the EMG was consistent with ICU myopathy and no pathology was found on C-spine MRI.
However he still required significant help with all ADLs.
AFib: Pt developed afib with rapid vent response on [**2-23**].
Since transfer to floor, the patient has been in NSR without evidence of afib.
This was thought to be due to pre-renal failure secondary.
After fluid boluses the ARF resolved with Creatinine back to baseline.
The FS remained within the normal range on his outpatient regimen for diabetes after titration of decadron.
Hypotension: The patient was admitted with hypotension which was responsive to fluids.
Lactates trended down and BP was no longer an issue after his acute management.
