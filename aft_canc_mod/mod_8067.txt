Right middle cerebral artery stroke with a residual left hemiparesis and left neglect.
End-stage renal disease secondary to nephrotic syndrome, on hemodialysis since [**2154-6-30**].
Atrial fibrillation times nine years (never anticoagulated).
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization.
Question history of Clostridium difficile.
History of hepatitis B.
History of aspiration pneumonia.
History of gastric polyps.
Status post hernia repair.
Head, ears, nose, eyes and throat revealed pupils were equal, round, and sluggish bilaterally.
Cardiovascular revealed irregularly irregular tachycardia.

Initial antibiotic coverage included vancomycin for a possible line infection, levofloxacin for the question of pneumonia, Flagyl for his history of Clostridium difficile, and gentamicin.
When the patient's urine cultures showed Escherichia coli resistant to gentamicin and quinolones, the levofloxacin and gentamicin was discontinued.
During the first day on the regular floor, there was some difficulty in controlling the patient's rapid atrial fibrillation.
On [**2-13**], Flagyl was discontinued as there was no evidence that Clostridium difficile was involved in his current infection.
His sputum culture from [**2-8**] showed oropharyngeal flora.
His urine cultures from [**2-7**] showed Escherichia coli.
Sepsis, urinary tract infection versus line infection.
Rapid atrial fibrillation.
