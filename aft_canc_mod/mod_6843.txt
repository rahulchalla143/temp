URINE CULTURE- no growth  CT head [**2141-4-12**] Hypodensity in the right parietal lobe consistent with acute infarct.
Left occipito-temporal lobe hypodensity c/w chronic infarct.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism seen.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Diastolic dysfunction.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Laminar necrosis and post-ischemic encephalomalacia associated with the old left occipital infarct.
Mild intracranial atherosclerotic disease without high-grade stenosis or vascular malformation.
There appears to be moderate to high-grade narrowing at the origin of the right internal carotid artery, with further quantification limited on this examination.
Bilateral cerebral infarcts in the parietotemporal region without acute hemorrhage.
30-40% stenosis at the origin of right internal carotid artery.
This stenosis is mild in nature.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates diminished vascular structures in the infarcts.
Otherwise tortuous arterial structures are seen without occlusion, stenosis, or an aneurysm greater than 3 mm.
Right parapharyngeal mass as seen on the previous studies.
Previous pulmonary edema has not recurred.
Bibasilar atelectasis is relatively mild.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are new or newly apparent.
No pneumothorax is seen along the unencumbered pleural surfaces.
On the displayed parts of the thorax there is no evidence of visible complications.
Normal course of the tube, no evidence of complications.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 78102**] is an 84-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, DM and previous stroke who presents with changes in mental status and evidence of new stroke.
Patient has new head CT with signs of acute RMCA stroke, now bilateral disease.
In the initial evaluation, the patient was very confused and disoriented, and concerning for possible non-convulsive status epilepticus.
He received Ativan 1 mg IV and had a further deterioration of his mental status.
Given his disorientation and somnolence, he was initially started on keppra, however this was discontinued the following morning as his bilateral hemispheric disease from strokes were thought to account for his change in mental status.
A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no cardiac source for his stroke.
He underwent an MRI brain and MRA of his head and neck.
The MRI brain confirmed the right parietal subacute infarct, however also appeared suspicious for possible acute infarct in the left parietal lobe in the region of his prior stroke in [**2139**], as this region was also bright on DWI and dark on ADC.
This remains somewhat uncertain as the area of infarct appears unchanged when comparing to his imaging in [**2139**], although MRI sequences do reveal the concern for possible bilateral acute strokes.
An MRA of the head and neck was notable for moderate to high-grade narrowing at the origin of the right ICA, although degree of stenosis was difficult to quantify.
Therefore, the patient underwent CTA head and neck which showed 30-40% stenosis at the origin of right internal carotid artery, which was considered mild , and it did not show evidence of any other abnormality.
ID; The patient was found to have a urinary tract infection on [**4-17**] and was started on ciprofloxacin.
CV; The patient was continued on his beta blocker at 1/4 his home dose to allow for permissive hypertension in the acute setting of stroke and as he was bradycardic on telemetry with a heart rate in the 50s-60s.
He was in atrial fibrillation, with controlled rate.
Heparin or coumadin was not started immdiately because of concerns for hemorrhagic transformation.
GU; The patient had hematuria upon arrival to the ICU.
This was thought to be secondary to traumatic foley placement.
ENT; patient was noted to have parapharyngeal mass for which ENT consult was sought.
They felt that this does not require urgent work up and does not pose contraindication for anticoagulation, should felt necessary for other reasons.
Goals of care; Unfortunately, the patient's wife passed away one year ago and he has no known family.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 169**] Center - [**Location (un) 3320**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Bilateral parietal lobe infarcts   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for evaluation of change in mental status.
Initailly you were in the ICU and required mechanical ventilation for respiratory support.
You had CT scan and MRI of brain which showed bilateral parietal strokes.
