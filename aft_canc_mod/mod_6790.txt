There was no head trauma or loss of consciousness.
Upon arrival to the floor, her CXR showed multifocal PNA, renal failure of unknown chronicity.
She arrives to medicine for management of her multiple medical issues, namely treatment for her multifocal pneumonia, pre-operative evaluation of her cardiac risk factors and management of her chronic medical issues.
She was then transferred from the medicine service for Afib with rate into the 140s and hypotensive with SBPs into the 80s.
The fracture was after a fall in her nursing home.
There was reportedly no loss of consciousness.
She acutely converted into atrial fibrillation with a rate into the 130s-140s about 1500.
She was given 5 mg IV Metoprolol and became hypotensive with sbp's into the 80s and her mental status deteriorated.

IMAGING: [**2143-8-25**] AP pelvis/R Hip AP/Lat - Right femoral neck fracture .
Multilevel spondylosis.
Mild spinal canal stenosis at C5-6.
Narrowing of multiple neural foramina, as above.
Grade I anterolisthesis at C6-7, which is likely related to facet arthropathy.
[**2143-8-25**] CXR FINDINGS: There is bilateral lower lobe opacities with obscuration of bilateral hemidiaphragms likely representing infectious infiltrates.
There is pulmonary vascular redistribution suggesting an element of fluid overload.
There are small bilateral effusions.
There are some vague calcifications projecting over the right lower lung, questionable etiology.
[**2143-8-29**]: CXR: Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
Bibasilar opacities greater on the left side, could be due to atelectasis or aspiration pneumonia.
There is no CHF.
There is no advancing pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
[**2143-8-31**]: TTE The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
A probable thrombus is seen in the right atrium (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]).
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with severe AS, CHF, HTN, [**Age over 90 2320**], who was admitted to the orthopedic service initially for treatment of her R-femoral neck fracture, but then transferred to the medicine service when it was realized that she had a multifocal pneumonia on CXR.
She was transferred to the CCU for dyspnea and hypotension and ultimately she passed away at 4:10pm on [**2143-8-31**] from a pulmonary embolism secondary to her hip fracture.
# Hip fracture - patient originally presented with a right hip fracture due to a witnessed fall at her nursing home.
Her pain was not well-controlled post-operatively, as doses of morphine were associated with significant hypotension.
# Pulmonary embolism - On the medicine floor after her right hip arthroplasty, the patient experienced dyspnea, increasing oxygen requirement, and hypotension.
Her continued hypotension and elevated jugular venous pressure caused concern for pulmonary embolus.
She had a TTE that showed a dilated right ventricle compared to the left side, consistent with PE and she was started on a heparin gtt.
# Pneumonia - Patient was diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia on admission to the hospital based on CXR findings.
She was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn for pneumonia acquired in a healthcare setting (she lives in a nursing home) and received 7 days of this treatment.
Despite antibiotic treatment, her respiratory status did not improve, likely secondary to PE as above.
# Atrial fibrillation - patient was in atrial fibrillation with RVR before transfer to the CCU.
She was hypotensive during this time and did not respond to IV metoprolol.
At that time, her blood pressures transiently stabilized, but she continued to be hypotensive while in sinus rhythm.
# Acute renal failure - patient had elevated BUN and creatinine upon admission to the CCU, and progressively decreased her urine output.
She completely stopped producing urine and it was felt her renal failure was due to acute tubular necrosis secondary to hypotension.
# Pump - Patient with TTE that showed LVEF > 55% and PCWP >18, [**2-1**]+ MR, Severe AS (valve area 0.8-1.0) but poor output with lasix after episodes of hypotension.
The patient was likely slightly volume overloaded with increased JVP but her blood pressures would not tolerate lasix and her kidneys stopped responding.
IVF were minimized as an attempt to curtail worsening heart failure.
# Anemia - She was anemic throughout admission, but her hematocrit was stable and most likely related to anemia of chronic disease.
# Thrombocytosis - Has been stable during this admission and it appears to be a chronic problem for this patient with platelet levels in the 500-600's.
