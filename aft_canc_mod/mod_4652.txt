The LAD had mild, diffuse disease throughout.
The LCx had mild, diffuse disease throughout.
The RCA had an ulcerated 70% mid-stenosis and an 85% stenosis in the PL Branch.
Resting hemodynamics revealed [**Month/Day/Year 1192**] systemic arterial systolic hypertension with an aortic pressure of 166/75 mmHg.

His rhythm was atrial flutter and his troponin were found to be elevated.
He underwent cardiac cath which showed severe left main and right-sided disease.
He experienced atrial fibrillation so he was placed on amiodarone and Coumadin.
