Admission Date:  [**2167-5-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2167-5-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2097-12-31**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bactrim Ds  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: SOB/hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: [**Hospital Unit Name 20719**] NOTE: PCP: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3029**] CC: SOB, hypoxia .
HPI: Ms. [**Known lastname 15427**] is a 69 yo F with h/o COPD (4L NC at home at baseline; frequent admissions for exacerbations) and s/p small cell lung CA with post-XRT fibrosis of the right lung.
She has also had worsening of sputum production in the last day with change in color to green as well as decreased ability to cough up secretions.
She denied fevers at home.
No studies were ordered to rule out PE because the ED felt this was low probability in the setting of an INR 2.0.
CHEST: decreased BS on right; crackles at right base; minimal wheezing throughout; minimal accessry muscle use.
ABDOMEN: + Ostomy, overall NT/ND EXTREMITIES:1+ LE edema, warm without cyanosis NEUROLOGIC: AA, Ox3; CN II - XII in tact; moving all extremities.
MICROBIOLOGY: 2 sets of BCx sent from ED; pending .
There is significant radiation fibrosis at the right lung base with persistent right pleural effusion and atelectasis.
The known spiculated right upper lobe nodule is not well seen on today's radiograph.
No evidence of pneumonia.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**11-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2164-9-20**], the RV has further dilated and systolic function has deteriorated.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 69 yo F w/ multiple medical problems including severe COPD, right-sided pulm fibrosis, and atrial fibrillation, presenting with SOB x 2-3 days in setting of increased (green) sputum production.
SOB: unclear whether bronchitis-driven COPD exacerbation vs. cardiac/pulmonary edema.
CXR not especially concerning for volume overload and patient with EF 55% on recent echo in [**11/2166**]; however, history of worsening SOB with recumbency is c/f cardiac source.
Decreased CO in setting of poorly controlled AFib less likely given that her HR not elevated on admission.
Said she feels better after "treatments" in the ED; on 4 - 6 L NC now, speaking in full sentences with minimal accessory muscle use.
-- albuterol and combivent nebs standing overnight; will change to PRN in the am if stable -- received solumedrol 125 mg IV in the ED; will continue prednisone 30 mg QD with taper beginning in next 1 - 2 days pending stability -- will wean to 4L NC (home baseline) as tolerated; no need for CPAP currently.
-- continue home dose lasix 80 mg QD; will consider additional dose if with continued O2 requirement > 4LNC in am or volume overloaded on exam.
PPX: -- bowel regimen -- will hold on protonix given low risk for stress ulcers (not acutely ill currently) and eating a regular diet -- will consider starting pneumoboots or SQH in am pending patient agrees .
History of atrial fibrillation 4.
History of perforated diverticulum status post colostomy.
History of peptic ulcer disease.
Severe pulmonary hypertension on Viagra.
Status post ASD repair.
Status post ventral hernia repair.
Depression 12.
Chronic PE in the right middle lobe of the PA   Social History: History of tobacco; quit over 10 years ago.
CHEST: decreased BS on right; crackles at right base; minimal wheezing throughout; minimal accessry muscle use.

1)Shortness of breath: Most likely due to bronchitis-driven COPD exacerbation.
She was started on [**Known lastname **] for suspected COPD exacerbation to complete a 5 day course.
2)hyponatremia - most likely hypovolemic however she did have slight lower extremity edema on exam.
3) ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: rate well controlled with no acute issues during her admission.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Two (2) puffs Inhalation four times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Outpatient Lab Work Please have a chemistry panel checked by your PCP 16.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Acute COPD exacerbation - hyponatremia thought [**12-27**] hypovolemia.
Secondary: - small cell lung ca s/p XRT and chemo - hx of atrial fibrillation - hx PUD - HTN - severe pulm HTN   Discharge Condition: at baseline O2 requirement   Discharge Instructions: You came in with worsening shortness of breath.
We also treated you with antibiotics, nebulizers, and steroids.
