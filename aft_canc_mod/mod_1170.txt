Neurosurgical and orthopaedic services were contact[**Name (NI) **] for management of subdural hematoma and distal femur fracture.
Small left posterior parietal extra-axial hematoma without associated significant mass effect or adjacent skull fracture.
These findings are suggestive of a subdural hematoma.
Redemonstration of expansile soft tissue lesion in the left sphenoid sinus, which is felt to be related to the patient's multiple myeloma.
[**12-28**] R KNEE plain film IMPRESSION: Pathologic fracture through distal femur.
[**12-28**] CT C-spine No evidence of C-spine fracture.
Multiple lytic foci throughout the cervical spine, consistent with the patient's history of multiple myeloma.
Interval CT scan showed no change in the size of the subdural hematoma: [**12-29**] CT HEAD There is again noted a small left posterior parietooccipital extra-axial hyperdensity, which is either unchanged or smaller than when compared to the prior study.
Again noted is an expansile soft tissue lesion with likely bone destruction within the left sphenoid sinus, which is stable when compared to prior study.
Left femur radiographs were also obtained which showed further potential for pathological fracture: [**12-29**] Findings concerning for infiltrative process in the left femur, with mild endosteal scalloping of the proximal medial cortex.
Compromise of the bone puts the patient at increased risk for pathologic fracture, though most of the cortex appears intact on this single view.
Postoperatively, there was weakness of his R leg dorsiflexion [**Last Name (un) 938**]/TA.
Attempts were made twice to obtain MRI imaging of his R leg to r/o hematoma compressing the peroneal/sciatic nerves.
Patient did not tolerate these studies due to claustrophobia in the MRI scanner despite sedation with haldol / xanax.
Postoperatively, he tolerated a regular diet and his pain was well controlled.
He tolerated a regular diet, and his pain was well controlled.
Transfusion record is as follows:  -Transfuse 2 unit(s) Frozen Plasma Indication: Factor deficiency (including liver disease) and patient actively bleeding or facing hemostatic challenge, INR > 1.5 [**1-3**] @ 1201 View  -Transfuse Platelets (1 apheresis product) Post-transfusion platelet count to be drawn within one hour of transfusion.
Indication: Hematocrit < 25% in a normovolemic patient and no medical complications [**1-3**] @ 1201 View  -Transfuse Platelets (1 apheresis product)  Post-transfusion platelet count to be drawn within one hour of transfusion.
Transfusion instructions: transfuse over 2 hours Indication: Other circumstances - specify:   s/p BMT, postop bleeding  Most recent platelet count 69* of [**2138-1-2**] 6:07 AM [**1-2**] @ 1431 View  -Transfuse 2 unit(s) Frozen Plasma Indication: Operative or postoperative bleeding and INR > 1.5 [**1-2**] @ 1431 View  -Transfuse 2 unit(s) Red Cells over 4 hour(s).
Transfusion instructions: transfuse over 4 hours please    Indication: Falling hematocrit or acute blood loss in a patient with unstable blood volume:   falling HCt in postop patient  On [**2138-1-6**], he regained some motor strength of his [**Last Name (un) 938**] and TA ([**3-2**]) and continued to be vascularly intact, with clean incision, and sensation grossly intact throughout.
He tolerated a regular diet, and his pain was well controlled.
for change in neuroglogical status, fever, chills, nausea, vomitting, chest pain, shortness of breath, increase in severity of symptoms, drainage or redness at incisions site, breakdown of wound, questions or concerns.
