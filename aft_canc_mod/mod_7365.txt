Admission Date:  [**2151-3-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-3-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2069-8-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: headache   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: suboccipital craniotomy for evacuation of hemorrhage [**2151-3-24**]   History of Present Illness: 81 yom with history of HTN, HL, DM2, remote alcoholism and cirrhosis, prior cerebellar hemorrhage in [**2149**], initially admitted [**2151-3-24**] to Neurosurgery with new right cerebellar hemorrhage, with hospital course c/b Afib with RVR, thrombocytopenia, newly diagosed liver lesions concerning for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) transferred to MICU in setting of altered mental status and respiratoyr distress.
Patient has prior history of cerebellar hemorrhage in [**2149**], with residual gait instability.
On [**2151-3-24**], he developed a severe headache, dizziness, and nausea, called EMS, and was brought to OSH ED where CT head showed a large right cerebellar hemorrhage.
Was evaluated by Neurosurgery and Neurology, and underwent emergent suboccipital decompression for hemorrhage.
He was called out to the floor [**2151-3-28**], and later developed Afib with RVR to the 120s-130s prompting transfer to the Cardiology service.
His course has also been notable for thrombocytopenia, which prompted a Hematology consult.
Work-up to assess for splenomegaly/splenic sequestation as a possible etiology included abdominal imaging that revealed hepatic cirrhosis with portal hypertension, at least 3 liver lesions c/w HCC, portal vein thrombosis, numerous varices, and mild splenomegaly.
Was also noted to have a cystic lesion adjacent to the uncinate process of the pancreas and duodenal sweep, which could represent a duplication cyst vs. cystic pancreatic lesion vs. peripancreatic lymphangioma.
This morning, he developed progressively worsening mental status.
As part of an infectious work-up, UA had been sent [**3-29**] which suggested active infection --> patient was started on empirical ceftriaxone while urine culture pending.
Was also concern for hepatic encephalopathy, and lactulose was ordered.
However, patient currently unable to take PO medications secondary to mental status, and he has pulled out a Dobhoff tube twice today.
Hepatology consulted, and felt that liver lesions were high concerning for HCC.
However, given cystic pancreatic lesion, would also consider cholangiocarcinoma or pancreatic cancer with metastases.
On transfer, patient tachypneic but denies dyspnea or chest pain.
On arrival to the floor patient demonstrated progressively altered mental status and tachypneic.
Due to high nursing requirement patient transferred to the ICU.
On arrival to the MICU patient was somnulant, minimally responsive or interactive.
Unable to obtain full ROS secondary to patient's mental status.
Past Medical History: HTN HLD DM Cerebellar bleed [**2149**] Psoriatic arthritis Alcoholism in remote past Cirrhosis Thrombocytopenia with platlets 80-100 in [**5-/2149**]  Social History: Lives with wife at home.
Does not walk much at home as calluses on feet and pedal disfigurement make ambulation painful.
sclera anicteric, slightly dry MM Neck: supple Lungs: coarse breath sounds bilaterally with transmitted upper airway sounds, rales right base, no wheezing CV: tacycardia with occassional ectopic beats, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: sommnulant, responseive to noxious stimulation, moving all four extremities; not cooperative and not following commands     Pertinent Results: Head CT [**2151-3-24**] R cerebellar hemorrhage measuring 5cm with surrounding vasogenic edema  NCHCT [**2151-3-24**] Post op Right suboccipital craniectomy and partial cerebellar hematoma evacuation.
Residual cerebellar parenchymal, subdural, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
New intraventricular extension of blood.
Increased effacement of fourth ventricle, without hydrocephalus or herniation.
CXR [**3-25**] As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs of mild fluid overload have increased in severity.
There is mild pulmonary edema.
Low lung volumes with areas of atelectasis at the lung bases.
No larger pleural effusions.
Echo [**3-29**] Mildly dilated LA, RA; no significant valvular disease, EF >60%  CXR [**3-29**] Bibasilar pneumonia vs atelectasis, small R subpneumonic pleural effusion  Abd US [**3-29**] Cirrhotic liver w/3 masses ?HCC, splenic varices suggestive of portal HTN, borderline splenomegaly  Abd/Chest CT [**3-29**] Multiple liver lesions c/w HCC, cirrhosis w/small volume ascites, splenic/paraesophageal varices, thrombosed portal vein, borderline splenomegaly, cystic lesion in/near pancreatic head, possible calcified splenic artery aneurysm, b/l simple renal cysts, diverticulosis   Brief Hospital Course: 81 y/o with history of cerebellar hemorrhage in [**2149**] presents with complaint of headache found to have right cerebellar hemorrhage s/p evacuation with hospital course complicated by altered mental status, as well identification of hepatic lesions consisent with malignancy (primary multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma vs metastatic cholangiocarcinoma/pancreatic carcinoma) ultimately transferred to MICU for increasing respiratory distress.
In setting of altered mental status (toxic metabolic encephalopathy) patient likely aspirated resulting in tachypnea, hypoxia.
In the MICU patient aggresively diuresised for any potential contribution from volume overload and antibiotics started for probable aspiration.
