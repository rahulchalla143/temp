Admission Date:  [**2172-6-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2172-7-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2099-7-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11217**] Chief Complaint: Left hip fracture, atrial fibrillation  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ORIF Left femur  History of Present Illness: This is a 79 year old man who resides in a nursing home, with a history of dementia, CAD, a-fib on coumadin, DM2, who had an unwitnessed fall and fractured his hip.
Orthopaedics was consulted and requested a medicine admission because of some changes on the EKG demonstrating ST depression.
The patient was diagnosed with prostate cancer ([**Doctor Last Name **] [**2-28**]) in [**2164**] and his guardian at that time decided on conservative management.
A bone scan in [**5-2**] showed increased uptake in bilateral femurs and multiple ribs.
His guardian has recently changed, and due to recent general health deterioration, the question of aggressive treatment is being revisited.
A bone scan in [**5-2**] demonstrated uptake in bilateral proximal femurs and multiple ribs.
Further history cannot be obtained secondary to patient's mental status.
The patient had multiple imaging studies and was seen by orthopaedics felt he was a surgical candidate.
Past Medical History: dementia with delusions CAD atrial fibrillation on coumadin hypertension Anemia (baseline HCT 23) cardiomyopathy sick sinus syndrome with pacemaker prostate cancer [**Doctor Last Name **](3+3) depression   Social History: Mr. [**Known lastname **] lives at nursing home.
No JVD CV: irregular rhythm, tachycardic, no murmurs Lungs: clear anteriorly, unable to auscultate posterior seconday to C-spine precautions Abd: soft, non-tender, +bowel sounds Ext: warm, intact dp and tp pulses bilaterally.
L lower extremity externally rotated Neuro: opened eyes to verbal stimulation.
Very confused, answered questions with incomprehensible answers.
Chronic sm vessel ischemic changes, lacunar infarcts, and atrophy.
CT C-Spine ([**2172-6-22**]):Multiple possible dystrophic nuchal ligament calcification/ossification versus post-traumatic sequelae.
Other  abnormalities as noted above.
In view of the extensive spinal stenosis, the possibility for post-traumatic cord injury needs to be considered.
HIP X-ray ([**2172-6-22**]):There is a intertrochanteric fracture without significant displacement of the bony fragments.
Additionally, there is a large lytic lesion involving the proximal femur extending into the intertrochanteric region.
There is a endosteal scalloping present.
This makes the fracture a pathologic fracture .
CXR([**2172-6-22**]): Left lower lobe opacity, which may be due to atelectasis, aspiration or contusion.
Suspected right lateral sixth rib fracture.
Bilateral femoral and right humeral metaphyseal uptake is of uncertain etiology and significance.
Left T12 activity could be metastatic or degenerative in nature.
-echo ([**7-/2166**]) Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with some sparing of the basal posterolateral wall.
The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No definite aortic regurgitation is seen except with ectopic beats.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild mitral regurgitation is seen.
No olds for comparison.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo man s/p ORIF for pathologic L hip fracture likely secondary to prostate CA, immediate post-op course complicated by an episode of apnea in setting of fluid overload and Afib with RVR.
The pt was to go to OR for ORIF of left femur on [**6-23**], but due to difficulty contacting his legal guardian until late in the day, he went to the OR [**6-24**].
Upon return to the medical floor, he was found to be somnolent and in rapid Afib with VS of T 97.3, BP 140/80, HR 160 irreg, RR 22, 100% on 3LNC.
He was noted to have a non-productive cough, lungs with crackles.
He received 5mg IV metoprolol twice with no HR response, then another 10mg IV metoprolol still without decrease in HR.
He had a NGT to allow for PO meds, given his poor mental status.
During the placement, he had minimal gag but was not fighting or appropriately agitated.
His lungs sounded wheezy and with crackles, and once the OR record was reviewed, he was ordered for a CXR and 40mg IV lasix (on 20mg PO at baseline).
CXR showed increased pulm edema on L side.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed an E. coli urinary tract infection which was found to be pansensitve and a course of antibiotics were completed on the floor.
According to the attending physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was back to his baseline mental status.
It is not documented as metastatic, though recent ([**5-2**]) bone scan has concerning lesions.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 16662**] - [**Street Address(1) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Atrial fibrillation with RVR Dementia Anemia Prostate Cancer ------------------- CAD s/p MI HTN   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Followup Instructions: Please obtain a repeat UA, as pt has just finished a course of antibiotics for a urinary tract infection.
