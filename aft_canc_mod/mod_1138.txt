Large intra-abdominal ascites limits evaluation for intra-abdominal inflammation.
No acute abnormality identified.
LENIs [**2122-6-22**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of bilateral lower extremity DVT.
CXR [**2122-6-20**] IMPRESSION: No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
ERCP Report: Impression: Evidence of previous sphincterotomy was noted Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a balloon catheter using a free-hand technique A narrowing was noted in mid CBD consistent with a stricture.
Mild post obstructive dilation was noted in the CBD proximal to the stricture.
Small filling defects were noted in the distal CBD consistent with stone/sludge Multiple balloon sweeps were performed and moderate amounts of stone fragments and sludge were extracted successfully.
There was no stigmate of recent bleeding.
A 5mm Submucosal lesion was seen with normal overlying mucosa seen in the transverse colon.
Given the submucosal nature the lesion it was not biopsied.
Impression: Polyp in the transverse colon (polypectomy) Polyp in the distal sigmoid colon (polypectomy) Rectal varices were seen extending 12cm from the anal verge.
There was no stigmate of recent bleeding.
A 5mm Submucosal lesion was seen with normal overlying mucosa seen in the transverse colon.
Given the submucosal nature the lesion it was not biopsied.
The rectal varices did not appear to have stigmata of recent bleeding.
Random colon biopsies were taken from the right and left colon to examine for microscopic colitis.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 53yo M PMHx APLS on coumadin, severe portal HTN [**3-19**] portal vein thrombosis, c/b esophageal/rectal varices c/b multiple GI bleeds, cholangitis ([**2119**]) [**3-19**] obstruction from biliary varices s/p multiple ERCP stentings admitted to ICU w fever, GI bleed.
Called out to floor with clinical improvement, s/p ERCP.
# Abdominal Pain/Fever- In combination with LFT abnormalities felt to be cholangitis, as he has had this in the past prior and required stenting due to stricture.
Paracentesis/ERCP were initially deferred due to his coagulopathy from coumadin.
When his INR downtrended he went to ERCP with retrieval of stones and placement of stent, as well as biliary brushings taken for cytology, with decrease in his LFTs and resolution of his abdominal pain.
# LGI bleed - initially placed on octreotide/pantoprazole drips due to history of GI bleeding and known varices.
Drips were discontinued after 2 days, and no further bleeding was noted.
Colonoscopy was performed which showed 2 benign appearing polyps and hemorrhoids; the polyps did not appear to have bled recently.
Most likely his rectal bleeding was from hemorrhoids.
# Antiphospholipid Syndrome - pt w history of APS causing portal vein thrombosis, on coumadin as outpatient; in setting of GI bleed, coumadin was held and his INR was left to drift down.
# Choledocholithiasis: continued on ursodiol  # Chronic Anemia: iron restarted  # Pancreatic insufficiency: continued on pancreatic enzymes  = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ================================================================ Transitional issues: - Microcytic anemia: pt will be discharged on iron supplementation.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Cholangitis Hemorrhoidal bleeding Colonic polyps Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (chronic) Portal vein thrombosis (chronic) Portal hypertension (chronic) Esophageal/rectal/biliary varices (chronic)   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 18**]  You were admitted for fever and rectal bleeding.
The bleeding stopped after admission with IV medications; colonoscopy demonstrated bleeding hemorrhoids and 2 polyps which did not appear to have bled.
You also had a high fever which was thought to be secondary to cholangitis; you underwent ERCP with stone retrieval and had a stent placed to your bile duct.
