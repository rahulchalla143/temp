Poor visualization of gallbladder and CBD due to gross distortion of liver architecture, but gallbladder does not appear distended.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 8840**] is an 80 y/o M h/o CAD s/p CABG, CVA, HTN, COPD p/w atypical chest pain, sepsis, and hypotension in the setting of likely pneumonia and a new diagnosis of CA metastatic to the liver.
On admission he was septic and hypotensive requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation to support his blood pressure, volume status, and maintain his urine output.
He required aggressive volume resuscitation for several days.
No organisms were ever identified in his blood or urine.
During hospital day [**3-17**] of admission, the patient had episodes of unstable angina with EKG changes and was treated with Heparin gtt, oxygen, morphine, nitroglycerine and beta-blockers.
His cardiac enzymes were cycled and they did not indicate that the patient was having a myocardial infarction.
The patient was noted to have abnormal liver function tests on admission.
A RUQ U/S revealed hypoechoic lesions in the liver that were consistent with metastatic cancer to the liver.
The patient did not have a known primary cancer at that time.
Due to his acute renal failure further CT imaging was initially deferred to allow his kidney function to return to baseline.
However, the patient suffered worsening respiratory distress throughout his admission which was thought to be related to a pneumonia.
It showed bilateral pleural effusions and areas of lung consolidation with a large 6 cm mediastinal mass and bulky lymphadenopathy.
The liver lesions could not be well-visualized due to the lack of contrast.
The ICU team had multiple discussions with the patient's family regarding prognosis and goals of care occurred.
