Her history dates back to [**2173-4-9**] when she presented unresponsive requiring intubation.
She had been diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer in [**3-/2173**] and underwent subtotal thyroidectomy on [**2173-4-12**].
She subsequently developed upper airway compromise due to subglottal edema.
Hospital course was complicated by acinetobacter and enterobacter pneumonias, newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus, sepsis, sinusitis, and atrial flutter.
She continued to have problems with tracheal stenosis, and was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2173-8-20**].
She underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy revealing tracheomalacia, subglottic stenosis, and infra and superior glottic swelling.
At rehab on [**2173-9-2**] pseudomonas, stenotrophomonas, MRSA, and enterococcus were cultured from the trach site, and she was treated with levofloxacin and linezolid.
Today she was noted to be having difficulty breathing through the trach and was brought to [**Hospital6 5016**] ED.
She responds "no" to question of speaking English.
Past Medical History: thyroid cancer dx in [**3-/2173**]- Papillary cancer with positive nodes status post sternotomy and partial right and total left thyroidectomy on [**2173-4-12**].
Apparently she was independent with mobility and basic ADL prior to her last hospitalization.
Her functional capacity recently has been the need for maximal assistance to total dependency in most areas   Family History: not known  Physical Exam: PE: T 97.3 HR 99 BP 110/50 RR 18 100% PS 10x5 FiO2 0.50 Gen: comfortable, alert, NAD HEENT: PERRL, anicteric, MM dry, OP clear Neck: supple, vertical scar to chest, t-tube CV: tachy, regular, no mrg Resp: CTA anteriorly Abd: +BS, soft, NT, ND, PEG Ext: no edema, 1+ DPs B Neuro: alert, follows command to open mouth, MAEW.

Mild spillover was noted before each swallow.
With thin liquids, mild aspiration was noted without cough reflex initiated.
Palatal elevation and, laryngeal valve closure, and epiglottic deflection were within functional limits.
No aspiration noted with thick liquids but mild aspiration upon thin liquids without initiating cough reflex.
