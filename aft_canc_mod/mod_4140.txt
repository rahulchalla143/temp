5 days PTA, pt felt that his ears were blocked with decreased hearing.
Went to PCP 3 days PTA, who diagnosed him with swimmer's ear and asthma given his wheezing.
By 2 days PTA, pt was confused, with slurred speech and inappropriate responses to questions.
Pt's partner states that pt has not been receiving pain meds for his BKA and amputated toes, as he was told this was phantom pain and he was instructed to take Tylenol.
Over the past few years, pt has been more depressed due to BKA and decreased functionality.
In addition, he had an episode of coffee-ground emesis during intubation, and his Hct dropped from 54 to 36.

CT Head [**2133-9-28**] Reason: BLOWN RT PUPIL, ?
INDICATION: 30-year-old male with fulminant hepatic failure and blown pupil.
CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is global hypodensity of the brain parenchyma with loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation, as well as diffuse effacement of the sulci and basilar CSF spaces.
There is no shift of the normally midline structures, or CT evidence of brain herniation.
There is a focus of encephalomalacia within the right occipital lobe from likely prior traumatic or ischemic insult.
Bone window show no suspicious lesions.
Mucosal sinus soft tissue thickening is seen within the imaged portions of the maxillary, ethmoid, and sphenoid sinuses.
Global edematous swelling of the brain parenchyma with loss of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]- white differentiation.
Findings could relate to a global hypoxic/ischemic event with secondary diffuse infarction.
However, this could represent diffuse swelling without infarction in a patient with fulminant hepatic faliure, in which case return to normal is possible.
Increased density of the basilar cistern spaces, which may be artifactual in appearance given the adjacent low density of the brain parenchyma.
However, the possibility of subarachnoid blood or meningeal infection cannot be excluded.
Recommend correlation with CSF fluid sampling if clinically appropriate.
Edematous gallbladder wall.
These findings are frequently seen in patients with liver failure and hypoalbuminemia.
Mild splenomegaly.
...................   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 30y/o M with HIV presents with fulminant hepatic failure after tylenol overdose.
#  Respiratory failure/ARDS - Likely etiology was multifactorial, including fulminant hepatic failure, possible aspiration, PNA, shock.
Pt had borderline acceptable oxygenation and ventilation and required high levels of PEEP and FIO2 to maintain O2 sats.
Ceftazidime for poss Pseudomonal ear infx as below, azithromycin, and vancomycin for empiric coverage of pneumonia given bilateral opacities were started.
He was noted to have a blown pupil and CT Head was done which showed diffuse brain edema, poor [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter differentiation, and new stroke.
With such poor prognosis d/t fulminant hepatic failure with resultand increased intracranial pressure and elevated INR, bolt was not placed.
The patient was DNR and a family discussion was had with mother and partner where it was decided to removed endotracheal tube in setting of poor prognosis.
The patient had a respiratory arrest approx 20 minutes after ETT was removed.
He was pronounced dead at 0030 on [**2133-9-29**]  #  Fulminant hepatic failure - Likely cause was tylenol hepatotoxicity.
Supportive treatment was maintained but the patient continued to decline and developed increased intracranial pressure as above.
# Upper GI bleed - Pt with coffee ground emesis at OSH, but presented with stable Hct and this remained stable.
Likely cause d/t coagulopathy in setting of liver failure.
#  Otitis externa - pt with bilateral ear bleeding, difficult to visualize TMs; appeared that pt had erythematous ear canals.
#  Acidosis - Respiratory acidosis, anion gap metabolic acidosis due to lactate and renal failure.
Supported intravascular volume, treated infection with above antibiotic regimen.
#  Acute renal failure - Pt with Cr 0.5 at OSH, presented to [**Hospital1 18**] at 1.3 here.
Likely was d/t tylenol toxicity and hypoperfusion in setting of hypotension.
