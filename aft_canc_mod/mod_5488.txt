Admission Date:  [**2169-10-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-10-23**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 358**] Chief Complaint: acute on chronic renal failure and urinary tract infection  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**10-5**] Left craniotomy for evaculation of left SDH [**10-6**] Extubated [**10-15**] placement of bilateral 8-French percutaneous nephrostomy tubes   History of Present Illness: 82 yo Portuguese speaking male with known metastatic prostate cancer origininally presentated to [**Hospital3 **] in [**Location (un) 5503**] on [**10-3**] with nausea, vomiting, poor PO intake, and coffee ground emesis.
He was found to be in acute on chronic renal failure (SCr 6.3) thought to be prerenal in etiology secondary to dehyration; a foley was placed.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis at [**Hospital3 **] found bilateral hydronephrosis, increased on left and new on right with new bilateral nephrolithiasis compared to CT [**2169-7-31**].
On admission to [**Hospital3 **] the patient was also found to have an MI with positive cardiac enzymes, though EKG unchanged, ie ST depressions in prior EKG.
While an inpatient at [**Hospital3 **], he struck his L posterior skull while on aspirin, plavix, and lovenox; he developed an acute subdural hematoma and was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] in [**Location (un) 5503**] to [**Hospital1 18**] via [**Location (un) **] for a left occiptal evacuation of acute SDH s/p mechanical fall; he received vecuronium en route.
He then received a L occipital craniotomy at [**Hospital1 18**] without complication on [**10-6**] and post-op CT head was stable.
Repeat Head CT showed a predominantly low fluid density within the subdural spaces bilaterally with areas of higher density again noted, suggestive of more acute bleeding.
Pt developed respiratory distress (RR 35, labored, but 96% 2L, other vitals normal, 5 beats VT self resolved, no LE edema).
He improved with upright positioning and tube feeds were stopped; stat CXR showed worsening edema, though cannot r/o pneumonia R side.
Also he developed a cough and appeared fluid overloaded on CXR.
s/p bilateral orchiectomy ([**9-28**]) DM HTN CKD with baseline SCr approximately 1.6 hydronephrosis bilateral renal stents Alzheimer's dementia anemia hypercholesterolemia DJD CVA  Social History: He is married and retired.
HEENT: PERRLA, Left corona with healing surgical wound s/p staple removal today Neck: Supple.
No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Babinskis upgoing bilaterally.
Asymmetric grip left grip intact.
5mm high density focus along L side of falx, could represent focus of SDH vs SAH.
No OSH CT available for comparison.
[**2169-10-7**] RUS Moderate bilateral hydronephrosis.
[**2169-10-7**] CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: As before, patient is status post left parietal craniectomy and evacuation of the left subdural space.
There is overall less pneumocephalus along the anterior aspect of the frontal lobes and left temporal lobe compared to a day prior with foci of air along the falx cerebri.
Low- density fluid within the left subdural space measures 7 mm in widest dimension with persistent foci of high density mostly near the area of craniotomy but also along the left temporal lobe.
There is more low- density fluid within the right subdural space compared to a day prior, measuring approximately 8 mm in largest axial dimension.
There is no significant subfalcine herniation.
Extensive periventricular white matter hypodensity and right basilar ganglia and bilateral thalamic lacunes are unchanged.
Imaged portions of the paranasal sinuses demonstrate mild mucosal thickening and mastoid air cells appear well aerated in the setting of a right sided nasogastric tube.
IMPRESSION: Predominantly low fluid density within the subdural spaces bilaterally.
FINDINGS: The examination was limited due to the patient's inability to cooperate.
There is persistent hydronephrosis bilaterally which appears to be unchanged from the prior exam.
A partially distended bladder is identified which shows layering amount of sludge in the dependent portion.
The patient is status post evacuation of left subdural hematoma, with bifrontal subdural collection, with crescent-shaped subdural hematoma with hyperattenuating material along the left parietal lobe.
The overall size and appearance of the subdural hematoma is unchanged.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
There is periventricular hypoattenuation with small prior lacunar infarcts.
There is minimal mucosal thickening in the maxillary sinuses.
IMPRESSION: Overall unchanged appearance of the subdural hematoma with bifrontal subdural collection post evacuation.
Chronic small vessel ischemia and lacunar infarct.
INDICATION: Worsening shortness of breath.
Volume overload.
There has been improvement in degree of pulmonary vascular engorgement and diffuse pulmonary edema has also improved.
Apparent focal opacity in left lower lung likely represents confluence of inferior scapular border and adjacent rib, but attention to this area on a followup radiograph would be helpful to exclude a focal parenchymal abnormality in this region.
EEG [**10-18**]: Abnormal EEG due to the persistent left parasagittal slowing and due to the bursts of generalized slowing.
The left parasagittal slowing indicates a focal subcortical dysfunction in the left hemisphere although the tracing cannot specify the etiology.
The bursts of generalized slowing imply a dysfunction in midline structures, possibly related to the first abnormality.
There were no clearly epileptiform features.
No evidence for cholecystitis or biliary abnormalities.
Fusiform abdominal aortic aneurysm with maximal diameter of 4.0 cm.
Grossly abnormal bladder with an irregular thickened wall.
This cannot be fully evaluated as there is virtually no fluid in the bladder lumen.
Brief Hospital Course: 82M s/p L occupital craniotomy and evacuation of acute SDH s/p fall on lovenox, plavix.
Now with UTI, worsening renal function, and fluid overload.
# Acute on chronic renal failure with increasing SCr (1.6-->2.9).
The primary process of the acute renal failure was likely from obstructive metastatic prostate cancer.
Renal US showed moderate hydronephrosis with bilateral stents placed [**7-29**](known bilateral hydronephrosis).
UTI: UA was suggestive of UTI and urine cultures grew enterococcus sensitive to amoxicillin and pan-sensitive to all antibiotics on culture and sensitivities.
The patient was asymptomatic but his dementia limited his report of symptoms.
# RUE weakness: RUE weakness was present prior to SDH evacuation but improved with surgery.
RUE weakness was intermittently present s/p surgery.
On exam, he showed decreased motor strength and repeat CT head showed overall unchanged appearance of the subdural hematoma post evacuation.
Therefore, the intermittent RUE weakness was likely due to deconditioning.
# s/p MI w/ increased biomarkers.
At OSH prior to transfer, the patient was found to have an elevated troponin and CK-MB X1.
EKG showed RBBB with lateral ST depressions (old from [**July 2169**]).
At [**Hospital1 18**], echo to confirm WMA and EF for prognostic reasons showed inferobasal hypokinesis and an EF of 50%.
Cardiology was consult and the patient was found not to be a candidate for either cardiac catheterization secondary to cormobities or IV heparin secondary GI bleed.
Medical management for MI was provided with BB and ASA.
# Wound assessment: The patient had a coccygeal pressure ulcer (Size: 2 x 0.7 cm).
He was turned and reposition frequently and treated for a fungal infection with topical therapy.
# Abnormal bladder on ultrasound of abdomen: Patient is known to have metastatic bladder cancer.
# Elevated transaminases:  patient noted to have AST and ALT increase to 200s; elevated alk phos to 600s.
# Medication changes: Many of the patient's home meds were altered during hospitalization: - Flomax stopped as no longer necessary given nephrostomy tubes - HCTZ and Norvasc replaced with metoprolol in setting of recent NSTEMI - Lipitor stopped as patient had elevated transaminases, appeared to decrease after holding statin.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: [**6-1**] ml PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for agitation.
Left sided subdural hematoma s/p craniotomy 2.
Acute renal failure SECONDARY Diabetes, HTN, Chronic Kidney Disease (baseline 1.6), Alzheimer's dementia, metastatic prostate   Discharge Condition: Neurologically stable and kidney function had normalized after placement of his nephrostomy tubes.
He was afebrile and vital signs stable.
