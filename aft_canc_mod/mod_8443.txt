Of note, she was recently discharged on [**3-6**] from [**Hospital1 18**] (including ICU stay for hypotension) and treated for GNR (E. coli) bacteremia, diarrhea, and bloody per enterocutaneous fistula.
During that hospitalization, fondaparinux was discontinued given concern for bleeding.
On [**4-1**] this was felt to be superficial and treated with silver nitrate, and on [**4-10**] there was no apparent bleeding at the time of surgical evaluation.
She denies chills, sweats, headache, neck pain, abdominal pain, dysuria or diarrhea.
She underwent CXR which showed pulmonary edema, effusions, cannot r/o PNA and she was given one dose of Cefepime 2gm, and Tylenol 650mg.

There are findings suggestive of volume overload including pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions.
In addition, there is confluent opacity at the right lung base, which may represent confluent edema, aspiration, or pneumonia.
Repeat radiography after appropriate diuresis may be beneficial to assess for underlying infection.
RENAL U/S: Limited renal ultrasound without evidence of hydronephrosis.
Oral contrast pooling on the surface of the lower abdominal wall directly above the ileocolic anastomosis representing an enterocutaneous fistula.
Enhancing soft tissue mass within the abdominal wall near the fistula, concerning for disease recurrence.
Bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral lower lobe collapse, and an increase in size of the right lower lobe metastasis.
No evidence for discrete abscess collection along the left anterior abdominal wall.
Interval progression of mass in the mid abdominal wall at the site of enterocutaneous fistula, concerning for local tumor progression, despite the short interval follow-up and confounding factor or superimposed debris along its surface.
Stable midline abdominal mass causing encasement of the superior mesenteric arteries and veins.
Enterocutaneous fistula as previously documented without bowel obstruction.
Bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged.
[**2164-5-12**] Chest Xray: Pleural effusions are difficult to compare due to positional differences, but a large right and small-to-moderate left pleural effusion are again demonstrated with adjacent basilar lung opacities.
There are no new areas of lung opacification in areas that are not immediately adjacent to the pleural effusions to suggest a new site of pneumonia.
For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 year old female with metastatic colon cancer s/p 5-FU/Leucovorin who presented with fever, hypotension and blood per enterocutaneous fistula found to have E. coli bacteremia thought secondary to her fistula, s/p 14 day course for ceftriaxone.
Course also complicated by cellulitis, fistula bleeding, and recurrent bacteremia with Enterobacter.
E. Coli Bacteremia and Sepsis - Patient was found to have SBP to 80s in the ED with little initial improvement after 2L NS.
The presumed etiology was sepsis, as her blood cultures drawn at [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 8**] (her rehab) were positive for E. coli.
Enterobacter bacteremia: On [**5-12**], she again spiked a fever and became bacteremic.
It was felt that the source of her bacteremia was likely her enterocutaneous fistula as it was bleeding and seeding her bloodstream.
Subsequent blood cultures were all negative but she continued to have low-grade fevers to 100.0-100.5 in the evenings.
Cellulitis: She was found to have a large cellulitis on her left lower quadrant/flank and thigh.
Ultrasound was performed which showed no abscess formation.
CT abdomen and pelvis also showed no abscess.
Her skin remained erythematous and indurated in her LLQ but it remained stable.
Renal was consulted and advised a renal ultrasound, which showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.
She was treated for her yeast with fluconazole but she quickly developed a rash and this was stopped.
Bloody fistula drainage ??????
She required intermittent transfusions due to slow bleeding from her fistual.
She initially had visible bleeding from her fistula which dropped off during the majority of her hospital stay.
Patient did have an episode of oozing from her fistula in the setting of vomiting.
She also later had an unprovoked episode  Bleeding was controlled with silver nitrate and Surgi-seal.
Her bleeding was always responsive to these measures.
Metastatic colon cancer: Now followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (heme/onc) and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Full report showed progression of disease despite chemotherapy.
# H/O PE/SVC syndrome/port-related clots: Fondaparinaux initially held due to recent fistula bleeding.
No signs of infection.
She had multiple episodes of bleeding from her fistula site.
# Leukocytosis: Mildly elevated on admission, decreased in setting of antibiotics.
Prednisone was given prior to CT as patient is allergic to the dye.
She immediately developed a rash on her upper and lower extremities as well as her chest.
Tachycardia: She remained tachycardic which was sinus on ECG.
She was not orthostatic and it was felt that her tachycardia was related to her underlying disease.
