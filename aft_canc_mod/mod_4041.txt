New moderate right hydronephrosis and hydroureter with a delayed nephrogram.
The point of obstruction is likely at the distal ureter as there is dilatation of the right ureter all the way to the distal ureter.
No distinct stones are visualized, but a recently passed stone cannot be excluded.
Again visualized is thickening of the antrum of the stomach with surrounding inflammatory changes consistent with previously visualized gastritis and mesenteritis.

Nausea improving.
# Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Unclear if these symptoms are due to chemotherapy, tube feeds, or gastric CA but recurrence of symptoms and inability to tolerate feeding trial with Fibersource suggests TF as cause, which may have been exacerbated by recent chemo.
# Hypotension- Initially the pt presented w/ hypotension after having a couple of days for profuse diarrhea.
He did have a leukocytosis w/ bandemia.
His diarrhea resolved after leaving the ED though and had no more further diarrhea while in the unit.
Pt did not have any more bowel movements so Cdiff was not ruled out, but Metronidazole was discontinued due to low suspicion.
#hydronephrosis - Noted to have right-sided hydronephrosis on CT of abdomen and pelvis.
This was felt to be due to obstruction caused by metastatic disease.
# Acute renal failure: In setting of finding right hydronephrosis on CT abd.

# [**Name (NI) 20973**] pt was complaining of persistent nausea with tube feeds.
He was started on reglan tid and he tolerated his tube feeds better, but had recurrent symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea as TF were increased.
