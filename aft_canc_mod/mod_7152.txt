In the days prior to admission pt notes fatigue, excessive sleep, loss of appetite and leg pain.
His weight has increased from baseline dry weight of 152lb to 157lb over past 3 days.
On [**7-8**], he had several EP ablations of inferior septal wall that were complicated by an episode of VT.
Procedure also complicated by a seperate episode of hypotension with an SBP in the low 70's.
Pt has no compliants aside from feeling somulent.

PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+  Brief Hospital Course: 84 yo M with h/o CAD s/p CABG [**2157**] and multiple PCIs, chronic systolic and diastolic CHF (EF 35% in past but 60% on last TTE) s/p [**Hospital1 **]-V/ICD with mod/severe MR, severe TR, AFib on Coumadin, slow VT s/p partial ablation [**2173**], CKD stage IV who was sent in with malaise slightly volume overloaded, and found to be in slow ventricular tachycardia to 80s s/p successful ventricular ablation.
#Slow V.tach: Upon admission, patient was found to be in slow ventricular tachycardia, and was not being paced.
Pt returned into slow v.tach s/p repeated attempts to pace patient out of rhythm.
Amiodarone loading was attempted, but did not break slow vtach circuit.
He remained stable overnight with BiV pacing and no further arrhythmias or events.
# Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic CHF: EF in the past was 35% prompting BiV pacemaker placement, EF now improved to 40% on last TTE.
Patient was slightly hypervolemic upon admission.
Prior to ventricular ablation, he had an echo with contrast to better define heart border for concern for ventricular aneurysm, 3+MR, 3+TR EF 40%.
There was no evidence for ventricular aneurysm as per echo report.
# Atrial fibrillation: now s/p BiV pacemaker and is primary pacer dependent.
He was slightly subtherapeutic to 1.8 during admission and required slight increase in coumadin to 3mg daily.
# Chronic kidney disease stage IV: Cr baseline appears to be 2.4-2.8.
Warfarin 3 mg PO DAILY16 RX *Coumadin 3 mg 1 tablet(s) by mouth daily Disp #*30 Tablet Refills:*0   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: slow ventricular tachycardia decompensated systolic and diastolic heart failure.
You came in because you were having increased malaise and your weight had increased approximately 5lbs.
We gave you diuretics to help you lose weight the extra fluid in your legs.
While here you were found to have an abnormal heart rhythm called ventricular tachycardia.
