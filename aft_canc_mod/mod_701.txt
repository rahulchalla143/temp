Admission Date:  [**2186-11-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2186-12-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2130-3-30**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**] Chief Complaint: chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: This is a 56 year-old female with a history of macrocytic anemia, MDS, possible seizure disorder, multiple falls who presents with chest pain.
Of note, she was just recently admitted to [**Hospital 4199**] hospital from [**Date range (1) 16384**] for lethargy and hypoglycemia.
She was found to have elevated INR as well as elevated transaminases and severe hypoalbuminemia, attributed to possibly underlying liver disease as well as malnutrition.
She was noted to be disoriented initially with visual hallucinations.
Abdominal ultrasound showed mild hepatic steatosis but no acute abnormality.
On the morning of this admission, she reports a general feeling of malaise and a sense that she should go to the hospital.
She then noticed pleuritic chest pain starting at the left chest and moving across to the right as well as up her left neck.
The pain also occasionally radiates in a band-like fashion across her upper abdomen.
She has had associated nausea and diaphoresis as well as SOB.
Also complains of a migraine HA, similar to her usual.
While in the ED, her BP occasionally dipped to the 80s but quickly came back up to the 90s without intervention.
She remained tachycardic in the 110-120s.
EKG showed sinus tach.
Trop was elevated to 0.03 but flat.
Because of risk for PE and poor IV access it was decided to perform VQ scan.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient is very anxious and says that she is having a "panic attack".
She continues to have pain at her L chest, under her breast, and L shoulder as well as migraine HA.
ROS: +HA, intermittent band-like abdominal pain, CP and SOB as above.
The patient denies any fevers, chills, weight change, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.
Chronic macrocytic anemia 2.
Bone marrow biopsy [**2179-7-28**]-MDS v EtOH toxicity pancytopenia > resolved and most likely attributed to ETOH toxicity 3.
Hypothyroidism 4. h/o questionable seizures, but neg 48h EEG and nL MRI in past.
Questionable history of cardiac arrhythmias.
Peptic ulcer disease status post Nissen fundoplication.
Asthma s/p intubation x 1 in past 10.
Family History: Father died of CAD at age 80.
No family with MDS or leukemia.
Physical Exam: INITIAL EXAM: Vitals: T: 98.7 BP: 104/68 HR: 106 RR: 18 O2Sat: 97% 2L GEN: chronically ill appearing female, appears older than stated age, tremulous, anxious HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, no epistaxis or rhinorrhea, MMM, OP Clear NECK: No JVD, no cervical lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: tachy, regular, no M/G/R, normal S1 S2, radial pulses +2 PULM: Lungs CTAB, no W/R/R ABD: Soft, NT, ND, +BS, no HSM, no masses RECTAL: brown, trace guiaic positive stool EXT: No C/C/E, no palpable cords NEURO: alert, oriented to person, place, and time.
Strength 4+/5 in upper extremities, [**4-1**] RLE, [**3-1**] LLE (exam limited by generalized weakness and pt's inability to continue with strength exam).
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
EKG:  [**11-27**]  Sinus tachycardia [**11-28**] sinus tachycardia with nonspecific ST changes .
RADIOLOGY: VQScan [**11-27**]:  Multiple bilateral areas of subsegmental defects, indeterminate scan.
Multiple acute pulmonary emboli in both main pulmonary arteries, every lobar artery, and multiple segmental arteries with no signs of right ventricular strain.
Trace right pleural effusion.
Bibasilar and lingular atelectasis.
Left lateral costophrenic angle opacity could be atelectasis or early infarct, should be followed in three to six months.
Unchanged 3 mm nodule since [**2181**], does not warrant further followup.
Abd/pelvic CT [**11-29**]:  No evidence of Retroperitoneal bleed.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function, without echocardiographic evidence of "right heart strain".
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course:   # Pulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis: CT Chest significant for bilateral PEs.
Her ECHO did not show evidence of right heart strain, and she had only a short period of hypotension which responded to fluids.
She did have an IVC filter placed on [**11-29**] given clot burden.
Her Hct dropped on the day of initiation of heparin, but workup did not reveal a GI bleed or a retroperitoneal bleed.
She is a fall risk, and will need physical therapy to lower risk of falling while on coumadin.
#Guaic positive stool:  Her stool on admission was guaic positive, but has subsequently been negative.
Her stools should all be guaiced, with GI referral for persistent occult blood.
# Urinary tract infection: Positive UA in the ED with mod leuk, 21-50 WBC, and many bacteria.
Has history of 2 E coli UTIs here over the past year ([**3-4**] and [**9-4**])-- resistant to ampicillin, otherwise sensitive.
# Hypoalbuminemia:  She was admitted with severely low albumin.
This is likely multifactorial due to poor nutrition, and possibly protein losing enteropathy, as well as the effect of the acute inflammatory phase of the pulmonary embolus.
She had no significant edema or protein in her urine.
# Acute anemia, as well as anemia of chronic disease: Her initial Hct was 29.7 which dropped to 24.8 while in ED.
Her anemia workup revealed an anemia of chronic disease.
Her laboratory values showed an extremely high ferritin, with low TIBC and transferrin, likely consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
# Alkalosis: She had a persistent alkalosis, improving by the time of discharge.
ABG showed this as a chronic respiratory alkalosis, with metabolic compensation and lower bicarbonate.
# Weakness/Falls: She has chronic gait instability, attributed to weakness and possibly alcohol.
# Acute renal failure:  She was admitted with acute dehydration and renal failure with creatinine 1.1.
There was no conclusive evidence of alcohol withdrawal.
# Hypothyroidism: TSH has been <0.02 on multiple occasions this year.
# Seizure disorder: continued keppra  .
