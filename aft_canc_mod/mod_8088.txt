Admission Date:  [**2109-5-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2109-5-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2032-3-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / acetaminophen  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Oxygen desaturation   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 35227**] is a 77 year old female with a history of left pontine stroke with residual right sided weakness and recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2109-5-8**] to [**2109-5-10**] who presents from rehab with fever to 101 and desaturation to 89% on 2.5L NC at rehab.
She had a left lower lobe opacity on her CXR in our ED and was started on hospital acquired pneumonia coverage, receiving cefepime/levofloxacin in the ED and vancomycin when she came up to the floor.
She was treated empirically for heart failure with iv diuresis.
She was also treated for community acquired pneumonia at that time and was discharged on levofloxacin, which she was to take through [**2109-5-15**] at rehab.
She has not had shaking chills or subjective fevers.
Currently, she has no acute complaints.
Past Medical History: - CVAs in [**2098**], with residual R-hand and arm weakness for 1 year afterwards - Left-sided progressive weakness - Meningioma - Hyperlipidemia  Social History: Currently at [**Hospital3 **] s/p stroke.
Family History: daughter had NHL, now in remission x9yrs,  mother died from breast ca, father from [**Name2 (NI) 499**] ca   Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: General Appearance: Well nourished, No acute distress HEENT: PERRL Cardiovascular: RR, nml S1/S2, no murmurs Respiratory: Decreased BS at bases, no wheezes Abdominal: Soft, Non-tender, Bowel sounds present, no organomegaly Extremities: WWP, no LE edema Neurologic: A&Ox3, mild chronic right facial droop, unable to move right hand, 3/5 strength in the right shoulder, sensation grossly intact .
Prominence of interstitial markings persists.
The descending aorta is mildly tortuous.
There is no pneumothorax.
Healing remote left-sided rib fracture is noted.
IMPRESSION: Ill-defined opacities in bilateral lung bases, more conspicuous since [**2109-5-10**] exam, could be atypical infection.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
Moderately severe emphysema with an inflammatory interstitial component.
Scattered areas of alveolar opacification, have not worsened since recent conventional radiographs, could have been due to aspiration or no longer active infection.
Alternatively, if the patient continues to smoke, the findings could be due to desquamative interstitial pneumonia or drug reaction.
Widespread atherosclerosis, including large plaques in head and neck vessels, left main coronary artery and branches, and minimally aneurysmal upper abdominal aorta.
Diffuse esophageal wall thickening could be due to reflux or other causes of esophagitis  Brief Hospital Course: 77 year old female with a history of left pontine stroke with residual right sided weakness and recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2109-5-8**] to [**2109-5-10**] for ?CHF and pneumonia, who presents from rehab with fever and hypoxia.
# Fever/Hypoxia: Patient had no fevers documented during this admission.
Her initial CXR showed diffuse interstitial abnormalities bilaterally and a questionable right base opacity suggesting pneumonia.
A CT chest showed moderately severe emphysema with an inflammatory interstitial component, also scattered areas of alveolar opacification which could be due to desquamative interstitial pneumonia or drug reaction.
Given this, and her lack of fevers/leukocytosis, and lack of improvement on the levofloxacin, this was felt unlikely to be a bacterial pneumonia so the antibiotics were stopped on [**5-14**].
A respiratory viral swab was ordered and a bronch was done with BAL, which did not grow any organisms and revealed pale airways suggesting an interstitial process.
She was started on methylprednisolone 1000mg daily for 3 days (day one recieved in the MICU on [**5-17**]) and will require a slow taper over the period of a month if her shortness of breath is improving.
# H/o left pontine stroke: Patient has residual right upper and lower extremity weakness which remained stable with no new focal findings on neuro exam.
# Right frontotemporal mass: Likely meningioma.
Continued keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued atorvastatin.
# Restless Leg Syndrome: Continued carbidopa-levodopa.
Carbidopa-Levodopa (10-100) 0.5 TAB PO TID for restless leg syndrome 5.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - LTC  Discharge Diagnosis: Interstitial Lung Disease of unknown cause   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted with shortness of breath which is likely due to an inflammatory disease involving your lungs.
