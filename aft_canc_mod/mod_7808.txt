Admission Date:  [**2183-11-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2183-11-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2106-2-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1572**] Chief Complaint: Presented for elective catheterization  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Coronary catheterization with stenting of the OM2 and LCx EGD with epinephrine injection and cautery of distal esophagus EGD with biopsy  History of Present Illness: This is a 77 year old male with a h/o coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure (last EF 15%), aflutter s/p ablation, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (on coumadin), chronic renal insufficiency, and schatki's ring dilated in past admitted to CMI on [**2183-11-3**] for elective cardiac catheterization.
Pt had exercise MIBI (walked 8.5 minutes with resultant drop in BP from 112/60 to 88/60).
Imaging showed fixed moderate defect in apex and distal anterior wall and moderate reversible defect in septum.
Pt vomitted x 3 with clotted blood in one episode.
Of note, pt had abd pain and postprandial abd pain as outpt leading to 30 lb wt loss.
Outpt work up has included an MRA abdomen to rule out bowel ischemia [**9-15**].
Of note, EGD [**12/2178**] showed schlatki's ring at GE junction.
Atrial flutter, s/p ablation in [**4-12**].
Prostate cancer followed by [**Doctor Last Name **] - watchful waiting, last PSA 2.5, and no signs of progression 6. s/p right hip surgery.
CVA, s/p B CEA 8. h/o Deep Venous Thrombosis 9.
HTN 10.
Left femoral-popliteal bypass.
Family History: non contributory  Physical Exam: VSS gen: nad, interactive, appropriate heent: NCAT, no LAD, PERRL, EOMI neck: jvd 2cm sup to clavicle at 30 degrees, cea scars, no bruits, supple cv: rrr; 2/6 sem without radiation lungs: lungs clear abd: soft, nt, nd, +bs ext: right groin c/d/i, no oozing, no bruits; good distal pulses in feet b/l neuro: aox3; moves all 4 ext, cn grossly intact .
Left bundle-branch block.
Left axis deviation has become more pronounced.
The [**Date Range **] to D1 with jump to the OM2 was widely patent with only mild diffuse disease in the proximal left subclavian artery.
The LCx had a heavily calcified mid-vessel 80% stenosis just prior to a large OM2.
The OM2 had a 70% proximal stenosis and a distal 50% stenosis.
Hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left and right heart filling pressures.
There was moderate-severe pulmonary hypertension.
There were large V waves on the wedge tracing consistent with significant mitral regurgitation.
It proved very difficult to access the left femoral artery and vein due to the presence of significant scarring and calcification.
The left femoral artery was imaged showing moderate calcification and diffuse disease in the iliac system.
Successful rotational atherectomy, PTCA, and stenting of the LCX and OM with a 2.5 x 13 mm Cypher DES, post-dilated with a 3.0 mm balloon (LCX) and a 2.0 x 12 mm Minivision (OM).
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
Moderate systolic ventricular dysfunction.
Calcification and scarring of the left femoral artery.
EKG post Cath: No significant change compared to pre-cath.
In this study, although a trace amount of pericholecystic fluid is seen, the gallbladder was not distended on that occasion.
While appearances may represent third spacing with secondary gallbladder wall thickening, acalculous cholecystitis cannot be excluded.
Correlation with clinical symptoms plus minus HIDA scan recommended.
[**2183-11-12**] Liver or Gallbladder Ultrasound The liver parenchyma appears unremarkable.
Again, there is evidence of enlargement of the IVC and the intrahepatic and hepatic veins consistent with congestion, and on Doppler examination, retrograde flow from reflux can be identified within these hepatic veins.
The patient's gallbladder again is noted to be abnormal, although it is not as distended as on previous examination and the degree of edema has lessened when compared to examination from [**2183-11-10**].
Extensive biliary sludge is again identified.
CONCLUSION:  The findings are suggestive of right-sided heart dysfunction and raise possibility of a congestive cause of abnormal LFTs.
There is extension of tumor into the adjacent squamous epithelium and focal ulcer.
Special stains (mucicarmine and PAS-diastase) of the tumor show rare cells positive  for mucin, with satisfactory controls.
CAD - The patient was admitted to the CMI service for an elective catheterization after an abnormal stress test.
The OM2 and LCx were both found to have critical lesions and were stented with good flow post stent.
He developed hematemesis x 2 and melenotic stools.
Two days after transfer out of the CCU the patient was started on lopressor 12.5 because he was having premature atrial contractions.
He received significant amount of blood transfusions throughout his hospital course and was in positive fluid balance.
For a majority of this hospital course, the patient complained of SOB and was maintained on O2.
Due to his rising creatinine, he initially received one time doses of Lasix and was re-assessed.
The patient was later weaned off the oxygen and his dependent edema later improved.
Rhythm - The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation but was observed to be in sinus with LBBB on EKG throughout his hospital course.
Anemia - Post cath, the patient developed hemetemesis and melena.
He was found to have a large HCT drop and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service.
The scope showed an esophogeal ulcer with associated friable mucosa with exudate and surrounding erythema.
Stomach cardia showed mass vs blood clot.At that time, GI decided that given the patient's clinical status and friability of the lesions, they would biopsy the lesion once the patient was clinically stable.
At this point, the patient had had only one melenotic stool over 12 hours and had not had repeat hemetemesis.
The EGD showed a small mass ?
malignancy and an ulcerating lesion.
His shock liver was attributed to hepatic congestion secondary to congestive heart failure.
On U/S there was enlargement of the IVC, intrahepatic and hepatic veins consistent with congestion.
The train of thought at this point was that right sided heart failure had contributed to the congestive changes seen in the liver.
With continued management of the patient's congestive heart failure his transaminases improved and coagulopathy resolved.
There was also concern that the patient's use of Acetaminophen extra strength for several months prior to admission and use of Acetaminophen during his hospital course to control his GI pain may have also contributed to his shock liver.
But the primary etiology was thought to be his congestive heart failure.
Acute on chronic renal insufficiency - Due to patient's elevating creatinine, renal was consulted.
They attributed his acute renal insufficiency to prerenal physiology due to low EF and lasix.
Adenocarcinoma- Biopsy of the stomach ulcer was consistent with adenocarcinoma.
Hypernatremia - While in the CCU, the patient developed mild hypernatremia for which he was encouraged to take PO medications.
The patient was discharged with the instructions to continue taking his medications as prescribed, not to take Acetaminophen (he was given a bottle of and precription for Maalox/ Diphenhydramine/Lidocaine)to return to the hospital if any worrisome symptoms should arise and to followup with his physicians.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual Q5MIN () as needed for chest pain.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: S/P stent placement and Upper GI bleeding   Discharge Condition: Good VS T96.8 (oral, HR 63-82, BP 100-106/55-70, R20, 02sat 95-985RA   Discharge Instructions: You are to return to the hospital immediately if you should experience any chest pain, shortness of breath or any other worrisome symptom.
Please note that you were previously taking lipitor but this medication has been held due to your elevated liver enzymes.
