He developed feculent output from the intraoperatively placed JP on POD 5, but remained afebrile with stable WBC suggesting appropriate control of the anastomotic leak.
The WBC rose today, however, and an abdominal CT was planned, but the pt became acutely hypotensive, tachypneic, and diaphoretic this morning.

IMAGING: [**10-25**]:CT Torso:anastomotic leak [**10-25**]:ECHO Severe global left ventriculaure systolic function.
[**10-29**]:White matter hypodensities without mass effect are likely related to chronic small vessel ischemic disease.No evidence intracranial bleed.
[**11-8**]:pouchogram:No evidence of extraluminal leak.
[**11-12**] ECHO - EF 35% 12/13 CXR - some increase in the lung volumes [**11-13**] RUQ US - large amt of R intraperit ascites.
No intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
[**11-14**]: CT abdomen: anastomatic leak; pelvic drain superficial, likely just subq [**11-16**] CXR: continued opacification in the retrocardiac region consistent with volume loss in the left lower lung [**11-17**] ECHO: similar to prior study from [**11-12**].
mild to moderate LV systolic dysfunction w/ severe hypokinesis of the inferior/inferiolateral walls.
LVEF 35% 12/18 CXR: redemonstration of small pleural effusions and increased density in the retrocardiac area c/w atelectasis or consolidation.
mild vascular congestion vs. low lung volumes.
[**11-18**] CXR: No significant interval change [**11-18**] KUB: Limited study demonstrating findings consistent with ascites [**11-19**] CXR: Small stable bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectases with continued mild pulmonary edema [**11-21**] CXR: Increased bilateral pleural effusions, increased moderate pulmonary edema [**11-22**] CXR: maybe mild increase in extent of R pleural effusion.
[**11-23**]: kidney US shows: no hydronephrosis and color Doppler flow to the kidneys bilaterally [**11-25**] CXR: no other relevant changes .
The following day an abdominal CT showed a pre-sacral abscess insufficiently controlled by the operatively-placed JP drain, for which a CT-guided pigtail catheter was placed by interventional radiology on [**2181-10-26**].
LFTs were mildly elevated, with INR ~2.0; a RUQ U/S was negative and presumably due to malnutrition and sepsis.
The acute component of his renal failure stabilized with creatinines returning close to his baseline, although he continued to have a metabolic acidosis, possibly from intrinsic renal dysfunction and/or from GI losses.
On [**2181-11-11**], pt developed respiratory distress followed by PEA arrest.
Pt was intubated and returned to the SICU; presumptive causes were aspiration versus persistent metabolic acidosis.
Broad spectrum antibiotics were reinstituted due to a new and persistent leukocytosis and low-level pressor requirement.
A bronchoalveolar lavage revealed a klebsiella PNA, resistant to zosyn, so the zosyn was switched to cefepime.
Abdominal CT scan revealed persistence of the the anastomotic leak, a residual sacral collection, and dislodgement of the pigtail drain.
The recent CT also revealed large-volume ascites; abdominal exam revealed significant distension and the ventilator pressures were increased as well.
[**Name (NI) 1917**], pt developed worsening abdominal distension as well as grossly bloody ileostomy output, with a Hct that was now 17 from 27, and rising pressor requirements.
He was aggressively resuscitated with transfusions to correct his coagulopathy and anemia, ultimately totalling 10u of PRBC, 10u FFP, and 2u Plt (despite the recent cardiac stents due to life-threatening hemorrhage), as well as vitamin K, over the next 8 hours.
The ileostomy output ceased but he developed worsening abdominal distension, increasing peak inspiratory pressures, increasing pressor requirements, consistent with an abdominal compartment syndrome.
He was taken emergently to the OR on [**11-16**] for decompressive laparotomy, evacuation of 6500cc of clot, but no bleeding source could be identified; no bowel ischemia was noted.
Several oozing sites from the retroperitoneum persisted, these were oversewn, and the abdomen was again packed and left open.
Echocardiogram revealed no evidence of new MI and cardiology consult agreed, with recommendation to resume antiplatelet therapy once able, which was done one week later.
The patient did develop atrial fibrillation and hypotension, initially unresponsive to beta-blocker and calcium-channel-blocker but later successfully restored to sinus rhythm after amiodarone and electrical cardioversion x4.
He remained on two pressors, at stable doses, with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] monitor utilized for hemodynamic monitoring.
Worsening pulmonary mechanics consistent with ARDS warranted placement of an esophageal balloon, which enabled increasing the PEEP significantly.
Later, his renal function declined with rising creatinine and progressive oliguria, leading to worsening volume overload.
The hepatic failure also continued to evolve, with bilirubins approaching 18.
In light of the multi-system organ failure and poor prognosis, the pt's HCP declined dialysis and later decided to make the patient CMO.
