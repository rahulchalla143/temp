On POD2 the pt had 2 episodes of emesis but was doing well otherwise.
Over the next several days, the pt continued to have occasional emesis despite restricting his diet to sips only.
In addition he was triggered several times for low urine output.
His urine output was managed with increased fluid and his continued bouts of emesis required placement of any NG tube.
During placement of the tube, the patient continued to vomit and bilious stomach contents were evacuated.
During placement of the NGT and the vomiting episodes, the patient had episodes of desaturation that improved with supplemental oxygen.
It was felt that he may have developed an aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and a higher level of care would be appropriate and he was transferred to the SICU.
Because of his recurrent emesis, a general surgery consult was called for a possible small bowel obstruction, but their reccomendations were to continue conservative managment (NGT, IV fluids, PPI, minimize narcotics, and consider a abdomen/pelvis CT for eval of retroperitoneal mass) of a likely post-surgical ileus.
While in the SICU a Chest x-ray showed a reaccumulation of pleural effusion on the left chest.
On POD 6 the [**Doctor Last Name **] drain was discontinued and followup chest x-ray showed no evidence of pneumothorax.
In addition, a video swallow evaluation was performed and showed that there was little swallowing dysfunction.
He tolerated this well and did not have repeat emesis.
