Admission Date:  [**2137-5-27**]     Discharge Date:  [**2137-6-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2095-5-8**]     Sex:  M  Service:  UROLOGY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mr. [**Known lastname 26022**] is a 42 year old white male with a history of metastatic testicular carcinoma diagnosed in [**2125**] status post left radical orchiectomy followed by four cycles of Bleomycin, Etoposide, and Cisplatin.
The patient had been free from recurrence of his testicular cancer until approximately six months ago when he presented with low back pain after going on an HIV "drug holiday".
At the time of his presenting low back pain, the patient also had symptoms of malaise and a low grade fever.
His work-up at the time was notable for significant retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy by CT scan.
Metastatic non-seminoma testicular carcinoma.
Human Immunodeficiency Virus.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
ALLERGIES:   The patient has no known drug allergies.
Anicteric sclerae.
Neck: Soft, no masses, no lymphadenopathy, no bruits.
Heart is regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs.
Left abdominal scar, well healed.
No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
IMAGING:  CT scan study obtained in [**2137-3-12**], revealed significant retroperitoneal, inguinal and pelvic lymphadenopathy.
The lymphadenopathy has been overall stable, although there has been one para-aortic lymph node which increased in size from 2.6 by 2.1 centimeters to 3.4 by 3.2 centimeters.
The estimated blood loss from the procedure was 1500 cc.
The patient had adequate urine output, but did have significant pain issues necessitating a pain service consultation to manage this.
Thereafter, the patient's pain was tolerable.
The patient was becoming increasingly depressed at this time, concerned that he was not able to care for himself, and mobilize as easily as he had been prior to his surgery.
On postoperative day seven, the patient was ready to be discharged when a large amount of serous fluid began draining from his inferior abdominal incision.
Approximately 700 cc of serous fluid were expressed and the patient was sent for a CT scan to evaluate fascial dehiscence.
Abdominal examination at this time revealed that the staples were intact, that the abdomen was soft, and that there was no erythema nor palpable masses at the incision site.
The CT scan did not suggest evidence of fascial dehiscence, although it did indicate that there were was a moderate amount of intra-abdominal ascites present.
Recurrent metastatic left testicular carcinoma.
Postoperative ascites and incisional drainage 3.

Obstructive sleep apnea.
