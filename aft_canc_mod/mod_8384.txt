HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was admitted with the chief complaint of belly pain and rising white count.
He had had a hospital course that was complicated by Staph abscesses requiring drainage and MRSA, positive blood culture, as well as small bilateral pleural effusion felt to represent foci infected with MRSA.
On [**6-8**], it was noted that he line tip grew out coagulase negative Staphylococcus, MRSA, which was sensitive to Vancomycin.
Starting at 5 AM on the [**6-12**], the patient noted abdominal pain described as a moderate negligible to mild right upper quadrant and right lower quadrant discomfort on rest, which became tender when palpated.
At baseline he had frequent nausea and vomiting for the past few months, but he feels that he may have had more in the past few days.
He also noticed new leg swelling that began three days ago, bilaterally.
He also has ankle swelling.
There was no diarrhea.
However, he also complained of mid sternal chest pain times two to three weeks and he complaints of shortness of breath and worsening pain while lying down that improved when he sits up and leans forward.
There was no cough, no fever, no chills associated with this.
The patient also complains of significantly decreased urine output over the past few days.
History was significant for acute myelogenous leukemia diagnosed in [**2180-1-8**], status post idarubicin and ARA-c treatment times two with consolidation chemotherapy on [**2180-5-1**].
Acoustic neuroma.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
for pain in the deltoid of his left calf.
GENERAL:  The patient is elderly-appearing, mildly uncomfortable, no apparent distress.
There was no adenopathy.
There was a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border.
Abdomen was mildly distended, moderate tender in the right upper quadrant and the right lower quadrant.
There were no masses felt at the time.
There was 2+ edema to the knees bilaterally.
The patient had a left leg abscess and a right upper arm abscess, both packed.
There was no erythema or exudate.
Chest CT, without contrast, showed a new large pericardial effusion.
There was small bilateral pleural effusions, no the right being greater than the left.
There was associated bibasilar compressive atelectasis.
Mediastinal lymph nodes were again noted with a slight increase in size of the lymph nodes and in the paratracheal space, previous noted 6-mm and curly measuring 8 -mm and a short axis considered to be likely reactional given increase in size during the short interval.
There was no significant axillary or hilar lymphadenopathy.
Lung demonstrated bilateral parenchymal marginal opacities without cavitation, no changed compared with the prior examination and concerning foci for infection.
CT of the abdomen showed no focal masses within the liver and no intrahepatic biliary ductal dictation.
There was a pigtail catheter, which was previously seen within the right psoas muscle, had been removed.
There was a partial re-accumulation of the collection from the right psoas.
This current measured 3.7  cm x 2.1 cm and could represent recurrence of the abscess.
Bone window show degenerative changes, but no suspicious lyticoblastic lesions seen.
There was a focal area of fat straining within the left lower quadrant of uncertain source or significance.
The patient, Mr. [**Known lastname **], upon admission, was then referred to the Cardiology Department because the large pericardial effusion, drained by pericardial centesis on [**6-14**] and 700 cc of hemorrhagic fluid was removed.
Hematocrit was 6%, LDH 400, albumin 2.4, with improvement in the patient's blood pressure and symptoms in terms of pain and the blood pressure which had gone down to about systolic of 100 to 110.
Pericardial fluid cytology was negative and cultures showed no growth.
The patient had experienced transient atrial fibrillation on [**6-15**], but that spontaneously corrected.
In addition, the patient was found as mentioned on CT to have an increased fluid collection in the right psoas muscle with accompanying leukemoid reaction with increased white cells.
As the patient remained in the hospital, the white cell count increased from that noted on admission to, what would be found by the day of discharge, at 120 white cells; 50 cc of fluid was removed by interventional radiology.
It was found that the psoas mass had gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
The patient had transient hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s overnight, remaining symptomatic, responding to a 500 cc fluid bolus times one.
Because of the pericardial centesis and fluid drainage, it was expected that his white count would go down, however, it continued to rise and reached 109 white cells with many immature cells and blasts, seen on peripheral smear.
Aspirate was attempted, however, no cells could be removed so that an iliac bone marrow biopsy and aspirate was done and evaluated under the microscope by Drs.
