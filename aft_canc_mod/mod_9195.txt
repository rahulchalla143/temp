Name:  [**Known lastname **],[**Known firstname **] A                 Unit No:   [**Numeric Identifier 10059**]  Admission Date:  [**2168-2-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2168-5-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2113-2-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ipratropium And Derivatives / Peanut Containing Products / Acyclovir  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2211**] Addendum: Please use Hospital course summary in addendum  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 54-year-old man w/ history of plasma cell leukemia/multiple myeloma who has hx of PE during treatment with  Revlimid, s/p recent DPACE treatment here with febrile neutropenia.
# Plasma cell leukemia/myeloma: The was admitted on Day +11 post  DPACE and was persistently neutropenic.
He was started on Cefepime monotherapy for febrile neutropenia and Bactrim and Valacyclovir were continued for PCP and HSV prophylaxis respectively.
On [**2-24**], Cefepime was switched to [**Last Name (un) **]/Vanco as his blood cultures grew out Coagulase negative staph and strep viridans.
Given his slow to respond white count, the revlimid was tapered to 5mg daily and stopped temporarily.
He was also started on lovenox for DVT prophylaxis given his history of PE while on Revlimid.
Bm Bx done on [**3-9**] showed 50% plasma cells.
The patient remained AF post transplant, but had signs of worsening disease: (IgG increased to ?9000 and right middle lobe mass thought possibly to be a plasmacytoma showed increasing size on repeat CT.  Due to concern for recurrent disease, he was started thalidomide [**4-28**] for treatment of myeloma as his disease was previously responsive to this.
# Disemminated aspergillosis: The patient developed respiratory distress several times week of [**4-18**].
On [**4-20**] he had an episode of atrial flutter resulting in volume overload and required diuresis.
A pulmonary consult was called and a bronchoscopy performed on [**4-22**] which showed no endobronchial lesions and friable mucosa generally throughout the right middle and lower lobes.
Biopsy was performed which resulted in bleeding but hemostasis was obtained.
Following the bronch the patient became hypoxic and had increased O2 requirement leading to a transfer to the ICU.
He required BiPAP at one point during his ICU stay but otherwise improved and his O2 requirement decreased with diuresis.
On [**5-3**] he developed a new rash (distinct from previous ones) whcih was biopsied.
On [**5-3**] the patient was deemed to have disseminated aspergillosis and was started on voriconazole and caspofungin.
Ambisome was not started at this time because the patient was in acute renal failure from other causes.
On [**5-10**], due to progression of his renal failure the patient was started on dialysis and at this point ambisome was started in addition to continued voriconazole.
CXR on [**5-14**] showed worsening of his pulmonary findings.
# Renal insufficiency: The patient initially presented with some mild renal failure, which quickly resolved.
His renal failure was thought secondary to cyclosporin toxicity.
There were likely other contributing factors, including his underlying disease.
# Intracranial hemorrhage: On the night of [**4-21**], the patient had an acute change in his mental status and became unresponsive.
A head CT w/ and w/out contrast was performed which showed "large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right parietal-occipital lobe region,  with extension into the right lateral and fourth ventricles, effacement of the basal cisterns, right hippocampal and subfalcine herniation.
Right parietal- occipital subarachnoid hemorrhage."
Possible etiologies for the bleed included disseminated aspergillosis.
Intracranial hemorrhage was the immediate cause of death.
Cyclosporin was discontinued and cellcept/steroids started due to renal failure as described above.
The patient developed a new skin rash on [**5-10**] which was Day +34 post transplant that was thought consistent with GVHD.
On [**5-15**] he developed increasing bilirubin, the differential of which included GVHD and antifungals therapy.
# Hypertension/tachycardia- Occurred after transplant.
# Bacteremia: On cultures drawn on admission, he grew 2 bottles of coagulase negative staph and 1 bottle of strep viridans.
The suspected sources of the bacteremia were the rash of the scalp as a source of the coagulase negative staph and his aphthous ulcers as the source of his strep viridans.
Because of the culture positive for Strep viridans and question of possible endocarditis, an echocardiogram was done which showed a small fluttering echodensity on the aortic annulus which was stable from an echocardiogram three weeks earlier.
Multiple blood cultures were  negative and cefepime and vancomycin were stopped after he was afebrile for 2 weeks.
As patient began to spike fevers again with no clear source these were restarted 1 wk prior to transplant.
An investigation was done and the conclusion was that the fever was  likely due to the patient's bacteremia and was unrelated to the transfusion.
# Rash: The patient presented with a papular rash on scalp, face.
The results showed no leukemic infiltrate in the sections examined and inflammation is minimal (there is a focal mild perifollicular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate).
While there is a central dilated follicle, no Demodex was seen within the follicle.
He developed a second rash on [**2-25**] which seemed related in timing to the initiation of Meropenem and Vancomycin.
He developed other rashes on [**5-3**] and [**5-10**] which are covered in more detail under the "disseminated aspergillosis" and GVHD sections above.
# Transaminitis- patient has underlying fatty liver seen on RUQ US and MRI and then voriconazole was started which caused a rise  in his LFTs.
