oxygen) and triggered for respiratory distress.
Respiratory status worsened despite inhalers and patient became increasing somnelent and consequently was intubated.
Per family patient had 1 week history of SOB with exertion.
Family reports several months of SOB but with exertion only.
Daughter has cold, but not severe and requires no antibiotics.
No chest pain.
Of note patient's most recent admission [**2141-10-17**] for headaches started on steroids/radiation therapy, dyspnea ruled out for PE felt to be secondary to metastasis.
Recent Heme Onc notes notable for agitation/hallucinations felt to be related to steroids.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: - diagnosed in late [**2135**] with infiltrating ductal carcinomas of  the right breast with positive sentinel node, ER positive, PR positive, and HER-2/neu negative - underwent dose-dense AC followed by dose-dense Taxol, then mastectomy and level 1 axillary node dissection with only one focus residual DCIS, then postoperative radiation therapy and hormonal therapy - developed bone metastases in [**2139-5-31**] and subsequently received multiple hormonal and chemotherapy regimens and radiation therapy to symptomatic sites - began Abraxane and Avastin on [**2141-5-31**], had 3 cycles (last  one on [**2141-7-28**] - began complaining soon after of increased pain in bilateral ribs at the mid chest level.
-MRI on [**2141-6-9**], showed further compression of the T4 and T6 vertebral bodies and new fusiform abnormalities in the posterior epidural space at T6-8 and T9-10 without evidence of spinal cord signal abnormality or significant compression.

No pulmonary embolus.
Progression of metastatic disease involving mediastinal and right hilar nodes.
True extent of malignancy likely underestimated by low lung volumes and bibasilar consolidations, due to combination of aspiration and pneumonia.
Given septal thickening at least in part due to pulmonary edema, lymphangitic spread of carcinomatosis would be difficult to exclude.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
-CT Head: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or infarction.
-CXR on day of discharge [**2142-1-3**]: In comparison with the study of [**1-2**], there is increasing diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications.
In view of the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and blunting costophrenic angles, this could well represent pulmonary edema.
However, the possibility of supervening pneumonia or even ARDS would have to be considered.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 42 year old female PMH metastatic breast cancer (lung, spine and leptomeningeal) who presents with respiratory distress of 1 week duration requiring intubation on arrival to ED.
# Respiratory Distress: Thsi was considered likely due to progression of knoen metastatic breast cancer.
She then ecame tachypneic and lethargic and was intubated and commenced on propofol.
She was transferred to the MICU for further care CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia.
Sputum revealed respiratory commensal flora.
Given progressive shortness of breath without symptoms of cough/fever concerning for PE especially in setting of known metastatic disease.
She therefore had a CT-[**MD Number(3) 24709**] showed no evidence of PE but did show progression of metastatic disease involving mediastinal and right hilar nodes.
In addition, teh report noted that given septal thickening at least in part due to pulmonary edema, lymphangitic spread of carcinomatosis was considered difficult to exclude.
Given possible pulmonary edema, she had a TTE which showed no significant change from prior.
# Altered Mental Status: This was initially presnet at time of hospital admission and peri-intubation and resolved [**1-2**] post intubation.
She had a CT-head which showed no acute process.
There was no sign of active bleeding.
# Hyponatremia: This was initially felt most likely hypovolemic or SIADH.
She has several possible causes for SIADH including metastatic disease, possible pneumonia or CNS involvement.
# Transaminitis: Slightly elevated from prior however labs hemolyzed.
Prior CT A/P showed no metastatic disease within the abdomen and pelvis.
# Metastatic breast cancer: Overall poor prognosis due to metastasis to lung and bone.
# Depression/Anxiety: WE held Alprazolam while on midazolamd infusion adn post extubation on [**1-2**] we restarted he home regime of alprazolam, Setraline and Perphenazine.
