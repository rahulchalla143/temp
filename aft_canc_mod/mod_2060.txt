There is an endotracheal tube with tip at the thoracic inlet.
Under sterile technique and ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle and a wire was passed into the superior vena cava (SVC) under fluoroscopic guidance.
Smoothly tapered, long narrowing of the retrohepatic segment of the IVC, associated with a 7 mm Hg gradient (mean pressure).
This is located caudally to the IVC anastomosis (which appears well patent) and could possibly be related to extrinsic compression from the overlying liver and surrounding structure in supine position.
No focal areas of stricture suggesting significant venous anastomotic stenosis.
Findings reviewed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] prior to termination of the procedure.
