Patient had catheterization today showing diffuse CAD with elevated PCWP and pulmonary edema.
# Systolic Heart Failure: Patient has low EF and elevated PCWP.
Patient denied symptoms; however, his exam was positive for diffuse crackles with decreased breath sounds at bases and elevated JVP.
He was fluid overloaded on exam and the overall goal was to diurese.
The patient's outpatient provider should consider starting a beta-blocker pending normal heart rate and blood pressure in the future as the patient has systolic congestive heart failure with a low ejection fraction.
#CAD: Cath showed 3 vessel disease with likely ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Patient denies symptoms this admission, but noted years of anginal symptoms in the past.
He has been considered for an ICD in the past but deferred given comorbidities and lack of heart failure symptoms at that time.
Most likely etiology was prerenal secondary to fluid overloaded state and poor CO. Other possibilties included contrast nephropathy, however the bump in creatinine was too soon after the cath to be attributed to the dye.
FeUrea is 29%, suggestive of prerenal azotemia.
Tylenol prn was used for pain control.

You were admitted to us after an ultrasound evaluation of your heart showed decreased function, in addition to your symptoms of shortness of breath.
A diagnostic cardiac catheterization allowed us to evaluate the coronary arteries and showed you had several blockages in your vessels that were causing your symptoms and decreased your heart function.
All the main blockages were relieved, with no complications.
Call your primary care physician or go the the ER if you experience severe chest pain, shortness of breath, bleeding or pain in your groin incision sites, or any other concerning symptom.
