Past Medical History: - Metastatic breast cancer (1) a right frontal craniotomy for resection of the metastasis by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 548**], M.D.
on [**2117-12-23**] (2) Cyberknife radiosurgery to the 1-right frontal lobe resection cavity to 2400 cGy (800 cGy x 3 fractions) at 84% isodose line from [**2118-1-26**] to [**2118-1-28**] (3) lumbar puncture on [**2118-6-23**] showed 0 WBC, 31 protein, and negative cytology for malignant cells (4) status post Cyberknife radiosurgery on [**2118-7-6**] at 2-right frontal metastasis to [**2108**] cGy at 70% isodose line and 3-left frontal metastasis to 2200 cGy at 77% isodose line.
She reports some evidence of word-finding difficulty intermittently, particuarly when she is fatigued.
Her oncological problem began in [**2105**] when she palpated a mass in the left breast.
A mammogram showed suspicious breast tumor.
The pathology showed ER positive infiltrating ductal carcinoma.
She was well until [**2112**] when she developed a cough and a chest X-ray showed a shadow.
A work up at another institution revealed metastatic breast cancer  to her subcarinal lymph node.
Her neurological problem began in later [**Name (NI) **] and early [**2117-12-7**], with pounding [**Hospital1 **]-frontal headaches that radiated to the occiput.
She did not have night-time headache.
She also had positional nausea and imbalance, but no vomiting.
A gadolinium-enhanced head MRI on [**2117-12-21**] showed a right frontal enhancing mass with surrounding cerebral edema, mass effect, and 2 mm of midline shift.
The pathology was ER positive metastatic breast carcinoma.
She then had another session of Cyberknife radiosurgery on [**2118-7-6**] at 2-right frontal metastasis to [**2108**] cGy at 70% isodose line and 3-left frontal metastasis to 2200 cGy at 77% isodose line.
Family History: Grandmother died of stomach cancer at age 76.

A moderate-to-large right pleural effusion appears similar when compared to the prior reference chest radiograph, and has increased when compared to the prior chest radiograph of [**2119-11-29**].
Previously noted right upper lobe consolidation persists, and may be slightly improved when compared to the prior study.
No pneumothorax is demonstrated.
Left basilar atelectatic changes are present.
The mediastinal contours appear unchanged, and assessment of the cardiac silhouette size is difficult given the presence of the moderate-to-large right pleural effusion.
No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
No pneumothorax.
Right chest tube has been inserted in the interim after pleuroscopy with interval decrease in the right pleural effusion.
Partial atelectasis of right lower lung is still present as well as apical accumulation of pleural effusion on the right.
No change in the mediastinal silhouette overall has been demonstrated including the left hilar calcified lymph nodes.
A moderate right pleural effusion with fluid layering along the lateral right lung and apex as well as medially adjacent to the mediastinum is unchanged.
Mild right lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged.
No left pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: No significant change in moderate right pleural effusion.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Technically suboptimal to exclude focal wall motion abnormality.
Pathology: Pleura, biopsy (A): Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, morphologically consistent with metastatic breast carcinoma.
Rare atypical but degenerated epithelioid cells (see note).
Discharge Labs:  [**2119-12-13**] 04:29AM BLOOD WBC-10.9 RBC-2.70* Hgb-7.3* Hct-23.9* MCV-89 MCH-26.9* MCHC-30.4* RDW-20.6* Plt Ct-250 [**2119-12-13**] 04:29AM BLOOD Glucose-101* UreaN-12 Creat-0.5 Na-136 K-4.0 Cl-106 HCO3-24 AnGap-10 [**2119-12-4**] 05:32AM BLOOD PT-16.2* PTT-32.0 INR(PT)-1.4* [**2119-12-5**] 04:19AM BLOOD LD(LDH)-263* CK(CPK)-53 [**2119-12-13**] 04:29AM BLOOD Calcium-7.8* Phos-2.3* Mg-1.7 [**2119-12-6**] 01:13AM BLOOD Cortsol-24.8*  Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 61 year old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer to the brain, lungs and adrenal glands who presents with shortness of breath and was found to have a recurrent pleural effusion which was drained at OSH with transfer for pleurodesis.
# Shortness of Breath: She presented to OSH with SOB likely related to her recurrent pleural effusion, and had 2100 ml removed before transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
Her effusion is most likely malignant in etiology and related to her metastatic breast cancer.
# Hypotension: Following the procedure, the patient was still sedated and hypotensive and started on neo drip.
Was thought that low pressures were most likely due to sedative effect, however, took a few days to wean patient off neo.
Antibiotics were not started given lack of fever and no localizing symptoms.
The patient was volume resuscitated while being maintained on pressors.
Because of her prolonged pressor requirement and use of steroids as an outpatient, she was also started on hydrocort in the event of adrenal insufficiency despite normal AM cortisol.
The patient's blood pressures were stable on the Oncology floor off of hydrocortisone and a random cortisol was 25 - it was felt it would be very unlikely for her to have adrenal insufficiency in that setting.
She was volume resucitated and her urine output ultimately improved.
# pleural effusion: The patient was found to have exudative pleural effusion based on Light's criteria.
Cytology of pleural fluid was positive.
# Stool in Vagina: The patient was noted to have stool coming from her vagina.
Gynecology was consulted for concern of a rectovaginal fistula.
Their exam revealed no fistula, but an atrophic perineum, thought [**2-8**] trauma from childbirth and poor nutritional status.
She tested negative for C dificile infection twice.
# Delirium - The patient was intermittently confused, not knowing where she was or why she was in the hospital.
It was felt this was most likely secondary to a prolonged stay in the hospital and ICU on top of poor substrate given her past CNS metastatic disease and surgeries.
#Dysphagia - on [**2119-12-11**] pt began to have some trouble swallowing pills and food.
There was concern for radiation encephalopathy as this coincided with some confusion/altered mental status.
Speech and swallow evaluated her on [**2119-12-13**] and felt that her swallowing was fine with the following recs: 1.
Alternate bites and sips as needed to clear mild oral residue.
As the pt's mental status and alertness was improving somewhat along with her ability to swallow food and pills we felt that the dysphagia had been in the setting of needing to swallow a significant quantity of pills quickly and that she would be able to swallow pills over more extended periods of time.
# ECG changes: She was thought to have subtle lateral ST depressions on her initial EKG in the ED, thought to be rate related.
# Diabetes Mellitus / Hypoglycemia: She was hypoglycemic the morning after admission with glucose 48 on her AM labs and FBG 65.
This was likely related to her poor PO intake and continued use of Glimepiride at home.
# Seizure History: She was continued on Levetiracetam 1000 mg QAM, 500 mg at noon, and 1000 mg QPM.
She did not have any apparent seizure episodes during her stay.
# Depression / Insomnia: She was continued on her home Sertraline 150 mg PO daily and Lorazepam 0.5 mg PO Q6H PRN.
# DVT Prophylaxis: Heparin 5000 units SC TID .

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath from a recurrent pleural effusion related to your breast cancer.
You were noted to have stool coming from your vagina while in the hospital.
You were seen by our gynecologists who felt you did not have a fistula.
While in the hospital, you were found to have low blood sugar.
This was likely related to your poor recent appetite and continued use of Glimepiride.
You were also seen by our Speech and Swallow specialists who felt that your swallowing was normal and you could tolerate regular foods.
