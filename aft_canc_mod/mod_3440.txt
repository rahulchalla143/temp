A follow-up colonoscopy this past [**Month (only) 116**] showed that this submucosal lesion had enlarged to 4 cm and the overlying mucosa was normal.
This showed a 2-3 cm submucosal mass in the ascending colon that was heterogeneous and was felt to be consistent with a GI stromal tumor or a carcinoid and not a lipoma.
Given the fact that he had no prior abdominal surgery as well as the fact that he was obese, I recommended a laparoscopic-assisted partial colectomy.
MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2151-7-19**]):    No MRSA isolated.
Brief Hospital Course: 53 y/o M with PMHx of Bipolar Disorder and submucosal colonic mass on who was admitted for elective laparoscopic colectomy today.
The procedure was complicated by significant bleeding and it was converted to an open colectomy.
Pt had approximately 1200cc of blood loss and received 4L of crystalloid intraop.
Per report, pt had a total of 200cc of urine output in the OR and was mildly tachycardic to 115 in the PACU.

There was concern for blood loss and need for closer monitoring, thus he was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
