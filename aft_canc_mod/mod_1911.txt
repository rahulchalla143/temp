Pt had chemotx on [**11-4**] and was feeling weak afterwards and went home to take a nap.
He also had a CVP of 14 but was given another 4L NS with poor SBP response and started on levophed continued on ceftriaxone and added vancomycin and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Over the next 24 hours he was quickly weaned off of levophed and SBP improved to the 150's with good urine output.
CXR was negative for infiltrates and sputum culture was contaminated with oral flora.
Metastatic bladder cancer-diagnosed in 7/00 when he has bladder resection and neobladder made from his ileum thought to be a curative operation with chemo of taxol and carboplatin and MVAD which he completed in [**12-20**].
Pt then represented in [**2128-12-20**] with rectal bleeding thought due to hemorrhoids.
Rectal exam revealed nodular mass and follow-up CT showed disease recurrence with metastasis to lungs.
Pelvic mass was treated with local radiation but otherwise was intially treated expectantly.
Pt started on alimta/gemcitibine in [**2132-9-9**] and reports being hospitalized for neutropenic fever after his first two doses.

[**Name (NI) 30983**] the patient is a 60 year old man with history of metastatic bladder cancer initially admitted for fever, neutropenia, hypotension, and diarrhea after recent radiation and chemotherapy treatment.
The patient then underwent exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, loop ileostomy, distal transverse colon mucous fistula on hospital day number 10 ([**2132-11-14**]) for a large bowel obstruction that was complicated postoperatively by an ileus, acute renal failure, a right paracolic fluid collection, VRE cholecystitis, and unusually high ileostomy output.
By post-operative day 32 all of these problems had resolved and the patient was discharged home with visiting nurses.
1) Sepsis: Patient presented to OSH ER with hypotension in the setting of febrile neutropenia.
He was enrolled in the MUST sepsis protocol and managed initially with pressors (Levophed), fluid boluses, and broad spectrum antibiotics in the form of ceftazidime and vancomycin.
2) Radiation proctitis and Ischemic Colon: Patient initially presented with chronic diarrhea and rectal urgency/frequency.
Diarrhea became bloody early on in admission and on hospital day number three developed BRBPR.
He then developed a large bowel obstruction following flexible sigmoidoscopy.
Surgery was consulted on hospital day number 10, rectal tube placed, and CT revealed a stricture at rectosigmoid junction with transition point and cecum dilated to 11 cm.
Patient then taken to operating room for right colectomy, ileostomy, and mucous fistula, and transferred to surgical intensive care unit.
Much of the right colon appeared ischemic at the time of operation.
Final pathology was also consistent with ischemic infarct with no evidence of metastatic disease.
On post-operative day number five he began vomiting and a nasogastric tube was placed uneventfully.
4) Atrial fibrillation: Patient developed rapid atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response on hospital day number 6.
Trans thoracic echo showed small pericardial effusion and TSH was WNL.
He remained in NSR (with the exception of PVCs and a short run of non-sustained VT on postoperative day number 8) as documented by EKG and telemetry for the remainder of the admission.
5) VRE Cholecystitis: On postoperative day number seventeen the patient developed increasing right upper quadrant pain and fever.
An ultrasound showed gallbladder wall edema and sludge and a CT scan demonstrated gall bladder distension.
Patient's pain rapidly improved and he rapidly defervesced.
Culture from the percutaneous drainage however grew out vancomycin resistant enterococcus.
6) Acute renal failure: On [**2132-11-26**], postoperative day number 13, the patient's creatinine peaked at 1.5 from a baseline of approximately 1 and his potassium increased to 5.4.
However, given rapid improvement following adequate fluid resuscitation, high BUN/Cr ratio, moderate hypotension, a fractional excretion of sodium equal to 0.7%, and the fact that the ARF coincided with the patient's increasing negative fluid balance, it was concluded that the patient's ARF was secondary to dehydration.
The Foley catheter required frequent flushing and frequent changes due to mucous plugging.
The Foley was replaced, however, because of high post void residuals and a need for closer monitoring of his fluid status.
The patient had a brief trial of a condom catheter, which failed because of inadequate fixation.
On the day of discharge the Foley was again removed and the sphincter reactivated by urology without difficulty.
Disp:*180 mL* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: bladder cancer radiation proctitis small bowel obstruction enterococcus cholecystitis acute renal failure high ostomy output   Discharge Condition: good  Discharge Instructions: Go to an Emergency Room if you experience new and continuing nausea, vomiting, fevers (>101.5 F), chills, or increasing abdominal pain not controlled by medications.
Also go to the ER if your wound becomes red, swollen, warm, or produces pus.
Please change mucous fistula bag every other day.
Leave  your midline abdominal incision open to air.
If you experience clear drainage from your wounds, cover them with a clean dressing and stop showering until the drainage subsides for at least 2 days.
