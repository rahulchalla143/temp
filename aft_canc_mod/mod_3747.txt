Briefly, Ms. [**Known lastname 5395**] is a 62-year-old woman with history of COPD who presented to an OSH with difficulty breathing after failed outpatient antibiotic treatment for presumed bronchitis - symptoms included 1 month of progressive dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and cough.
10lb weight loss over 1 month prior to hospitalization, some anorexia (all per report).
CXR showed bilateral hilar masses with multiple lung lesions.
Chest CT showed multiple nodules and mediastinal LN enlargement.
Bronschosopy under intubation with biopsy at OSH revealed undifferentiated CA, likely small-cell lung CA and possible post-obstructive PNA.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-18**] and had flexible bronchoscopy in SICU which showed extrinsic compression of LUL/lingula/LLL, but L mainstem was patent.
Patient also had thick sputum presumed to be from post-obstructive pneumonia.
She was taken to OR on [**11-19**] for flexible bronchoscopy through rigid scope to obtain specimens -- here, IP performed TBFNA of L paratracheal and subcarinal nodes, EBBx of LUL, brush of LUL, BAL for cytology of LUL.
Given findings of obstructive mass and new lung CA, patient was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to receive radiation and chemotherapy.
COPD (45 PY tobacco-use history) 2.
No mammograms, colonoscopy or pap smears done.
LUNGS: Crackles over right upper lung field.
Absent lung sounds in left lung fields.
Large obstructing left perihilar mass accompanied by significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Leftsided tracheal impression with slight rightward shift due to displacement by the lymphadenopathy.
Abrupt termination of the distal left main bronchus likely due to left hilar mass with associated collapse of the left lung and left pleural effusion.
left lower lobe lung mass.
Right lung consolidations consistent with inflasmmation/infection/aspiration.
Leftsided pleural effusion.
Questionable splenic masses versus perfusion anomaly on single phase arterial phase scan.
Overall appearances highly suggestive for lung malignancy, possibly small cell carcinoma but correlate clinically and with bronchoscopy/biopsy.
No significant interval change.
poor R wave progression.
No acute ST/T changes.
Examination of the frozen section shows that no tumor is present on the frozen section.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P 62-year-old woman with new SCLCa and obstructing mass causing white-out of left lung and post-obstructive PNA.
She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] with symptoms of hemoptysis and left lung whiteout for bronchial stenting and artery embolization.
# LUNG CA:  Intitially pathology was read as small cell lung cancer which on further evaluation was determined to be NSCLC, most likely squamous.
CT abd/pelvis showed no metastasis.
MRI read shows no mets.
# RESPIRATORY DISTRESS/POST-OBSTRUCTIVE PNEUMONIA/?COPD: After bronchoscopy, the patient remained intubated given total white-out of left lung field from obstruction due to NSCLCa and underlying severe COPD.
She was also diagnosed with a presumed post-obstructive PNA with leukocytosis and fever and started on Levofloxacin for a 14 day course.
In addition, she was started on  treatemtn for COPD flare: Albuterol/ Atroven, IV Methylprednisolone which COPD treatment which is now being taper off.
Discharge Diagnosis: Non-Small cell lung cancer post-obstructive PNA   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You are being discharged from the hospital after being admitted for shortness of breath.
You were also found to have a pneumonia, and have completed a course of antibiotics.
You still remain short of breath because of the compromise to the airways by the lung cancer, and are being discharged with home oxygen to maintain adequate oxygenation.
