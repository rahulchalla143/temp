Discharge Day Laboratories: [**2106-12-3**] WBC-7.3 RBC-3.51* Hgb-10.2* Hct-32.3* MCV-92 Plt Ct-260 [**2106-12-3**] Glucose-58* UreaN-16 Creat-1.2* Na-142 K-3.5 Cl-103 HCO3-29  Brief Hospital Course: 86F with hx of pancreatic CA s/p biliary stenting presenting with ascending cholangitis.
#: Septic Shock: Pt with fever, leukocytosis, increased LFTs in setting of dilated CBD, thus infected source likely biliary, consistent with ascending cholangitis.
Patient received IVF, but remained hypotensive so was started on Levophed.
With decompression of CBD, sepsis resolved and patient was weaned off pressors.
#: Ascending Cholangitis: Pt with elevated transaminases, Alk Phos, TB in setting of a stent 1.4cm in the CBD.
Ultrasound revealing dilated intrahepatic ducts at 4mm and radiographic findings suggestive of small stones and sluge in the GB.
No evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Treatment for her infection occurred as per above.
# Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Bicarb of 17 on initial labs with gap of 14.
Lactate slightly elevated at 2.2.
Diarrhea (Non-Gap) may also be contributing to decreased bicarb.
Patient received large amount NS, and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis was also a contributor to her acid-base picture.
DDx Pre-renal from hypoperfusion in the setting of septic shock, less likely post-renal, intrinsic.
#Oncology: Patient without a tissue diagnosis, and interested in knowing her options.
She was noted to have a right adnexal mass on abdominal CT; follow-up pelvic ultrasound was non-diagnostic.
#Diarrhea: Patient complained of loose stools upon resumption of her diet after stent placement.
