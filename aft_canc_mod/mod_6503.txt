Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated two vessel disease.
The LMCA had non-obstructive coronary disease.
The LAD had a 70% stenosis mid-vessel.
Allowing for differences in positioning, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely stable.
There is some patchy increased retrocardiac density and atelectasis at the left base.
There is minimal blunting of left greater than right costophrenic angles, consistent with minimal pleural fluid.
Compared with [**2166-1-16**], there has been partial interval clearing of opacity at the right base and of the right effusion.
Atelectasis at the left base is slightly worse.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a bioprosthetic valve well-seated in the mitral position with good leaflet excursion.
There is no transvalvular regurgitation .
All other findings consistent with pre-bypass findings.
He received vancomycin for perioperative antibiotics.
He remained in the intensive care unit for pulmonary and hemodynamic management.
He had a brief episode of atrial fibrillation which converted with beta blockade.
He had loose stools which resolved when discontinuing his Colace.
