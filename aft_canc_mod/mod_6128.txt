No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2114-10-9**] CXR: IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax.
No significant interval change.
Stable large right pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis and small left pleural effusion.
[**2114-10-8**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**10-7**], there is continued opacification at the right base consistent with pleural effusion and atelectasis.
Smaller effusion is seen at the left base.
# Flexible bronchoscopy with aspiration cervical mediastinoscopy, median sternotomy and repair of innominate artery: The patient is a 75 yo male w/RUL biopsy-proven non small cell lung ca who was admitted on [**10-5**] for bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy for staging purposes.
The patient was taken to the operating room on [**10-5**]; the mediastinoscopy was complicated by significant scarring (probably from infiltrative tumorous process) in pretracheal space with a subsequent tear in the inominate Artery requiring emergent sternotomy with primary repair.
# Rapid Atrial Fibrillation: On POD2 the patient went into rapid atrial fibrillation.
The evening of POD3 he converted back to atrial fibrillation with regular ventricular rate.
# Right sided effusion The patient was brought to the SICU with a mediastinal [**Doctor Last Name **] in place; this was discontinued on POD2.
On POD4 the patient was noted to have a developing right sided effusion.
They drained 340 ml of bloody discharge.
# NSCLCA Unfortunately, the mediastinal lymph nodes were positive for metastatic disease.
