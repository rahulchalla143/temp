[**2197-10-26**] Trace fluid and tiny pocket of free fluid.
Ultrasound-guided aspration of 0.5 ml of slightly blood-tinged clear ascitic fluid.
Given the small volume, sample could only be sent for one laboratory evaluation.1    Brief Hospital Course: 53F PMHx sig HepC cirrhosis c/b esophageal varices s/p banding and multiple episodes of UGI bleeds presents with 2d hx of melena and nausea, likely upper GI bleed, who developed a fever in the setting of URI symptoms unlikely to be due to SBP or bacteremia.
# GI bleed:  Positive NG lavage and hx of bleeding varices and ulcers made suspicion very high for upper GI source.
EGD was performed and showed portal gastropathy (presumed cause of bleeding) and non-bleeding varices not requiring any banding.
#Fever: Patient developed a fever at the time she arrived on themedical floor.
Her CXR was clear, ans she had URI symptoms with sinus pressure.
She was on ceftriaxone at the time, and given she had a small amount of ascites, she had a tap of the ascites performed by IR who saw minimal amount of fluid and only got 1/2 cc, which was sent for cell count which was negative for SBP.
The cause of the fever is likely sinusisit, she was discharged on a 10 day course of cipro, whch would cover her for her UGIB abx prophylaxis as well as sinusitis.
Hct baseline appears to be in high 20s, acute drop due to GI bleed as above.
# Hepatitis C cirrhosis: Other than GI bleeding, no signs of acute decompensation.
Nadolol- please increase the dose to 60mg by mouth twice a day (new prescription given)  If you develop a high fever, please call your doctor, or feel free to come back to the ED.
Flonase 50 mcg/Actuation Spray, Suspension Sig: [**2-5**] sprays Nasal twice a day as needed for cold symptoms.
Disp:*1 bottle* Refills:*1*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Upper gastrointestinal bleed from portal gastropathy Secondary: Hepatitis C cirrhosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital for an upper gastrointestinal bleed where you were having dark tary stools.
In the ED they found that you had lost a lot of blood and required a blood transfusion and you were monitored in the intensive care unit.
You underwent a camera study called endoscopy, which showed stomach inflammation, likely from your liver disease, as the cause for your bleeding.
After you were transferred to the regular medical floor you had a fever and we were concerned that you could have an infection in the fluid in your abdomen, so we performed a paracentesis (take the fluid amount out).
The source of your fever is likely your sinuses, and we will send you out on an antibiotic pill to cover you for both the sinus infection as well as preventing infections after having the GI bleed.
Nadolol- please increase the dose to 60mg by mouth twice a day (new prescription given)  If you develop a high fever, please call your doctor, or feel free to come back to the ED.
