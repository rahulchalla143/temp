Admission Date:  [**2184-8-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2184-8-24**]   Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Lisinopril / Plaquenil / Haldol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**] Chief Complaint: Lethargy and abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2184-8-16**]: retroperitoneal mass biopsy [**2184-8-23**]: Exploratory Lap ( Unresectable)   History of Present Illness: 89F mild dementia at baseline, RA, HTN, anemia, CRI from nursing home for evaluation of lethargy.
Abdominal tenderness was also noted.
Exam was significant for AAOx3, marked abdominal tenderness with guarding, and guiaic positive brown stool.
Imaging including abdominal US, CT Abd and Plevis without contrast were suggestive of gangrenous cholecystitis with wall thickening and probable hemorrhage with no frank perforation.
CT showed dilated gallbladder with pericholecystics stranding and irregular wall contour again raising concern for gangrenous cholecystitis less likely [**Hospital3 **] surgery was consulted with initial impression of gangrenous cholecystitis with suggestion of perc chole but further review may suggest a gallbladder mass with secondary infection.
Also h/o chronic NSAID use.
No DMARDs or biologics in the past per rheum note 04/[**2183**].
Aortic insufficiency (1+ on echo in [**2176**]) 3.
HTN 4.
Anemia - previous labs c/w anemia of chronic inflammation, also h/o B12 deficiency 5.
Hyperlipidemia 7.
Hx of esophageal tear [**2178**] 9.
Family History: none relavent to this presentation  Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema   Pertinent Results: ABDOMINAL CT [**8-13**]:IMPRESSION: 1.
Abnormal dilated gallbladder with an irregular margin and a small amount of pericholecystic stranding.
No pericholecystic fluid is seen.
The findings raise concern for gangrenous cholecystitis versus GB mass.
Mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation as seen on MRI [**2178**].
No small-bowel obstruction.
NCHCT [**8-13**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND [**8-13**]: IMPRESSION: Abnormal GB with irregular mass-like wall thickening.
The appearance is atypical for acute cholecystitis, although the clinical picture suggests infection.
**FINAL REPORT [**2184-8-15**]**     Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2184-8-15**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Gallbladder enlargement with mural thickening and hyperenhancement in keeping with a gallbladder carcinoma.
The mass is closely related to the first and second parts of duodenum, transverse colon and right lobe of the liver.
However, there is no evidence of frank invasion of these structures.
No enlarged adjacent lymph nodes.
No liver metastasis.
Stable scarring and parenchymal calcification in the right upper lobe likely secondary to prior granulomatous disease.
[**2184-8-13**] CT head: No acute intracranial process.
Gallbladder biopsy: The specimen consists predominantly of fragments of necrotic tissue, but a few well preserved markedly atypical glands are present in a fibrotic stroma consistent with adenocarcinoma.
Brief Hospital Course: 89F multiple medication issues presenting with gram negative bacteremia from a biliary source thought to represent a gallbladder mass with probable superinfection.
# Sepsis:  Patient presented with SIRS criteria and GNR bacteria from a likely billiary source.
Her lactate cleared (5.2 --> 5.5 --> 1.9) with fluid resuscitation.
Blood pressures were stable without need for pressor support.
Bactrim will be continued as outpatient to complete a 14 day course  # Gallbladder mass- Adenocarcinoma:  Abdominal CT and US was notable for a markedly dialated and tortuous gallbaldder.
Imaging was initially concerning for a gangernous cholangtitis, but upon further review suggested a billiary mass (carcinoma) with overlaying super infection.
Pt went to OR on [**2184-8-24**] but decision was made not to remove gallbladder given extent of her disease.
# Transaminitis:  Felt to be secondary to gallbladder pathology (adenocarcinoma) versus a primary hepatic issue.
Oncology did not recommend continuing the anticoagulation due to tumor thrombus concerns.
# Rheumatoid Arthritis: continued prednisone   Medications on Admission: - norvasc 5 mg PO qD - caltrate 600 and Vit D 200 units PO daily - colace - senna - lidoderm patch prn knee pain - mirtazapine 15 mg PO qHS - prednisone 10 mg PO qD - tramadol 25 mg PO qD - coumadin 4.5 mg PO qD - cipro HC otic 2 drops to L ear twice daily   Discharge Medications: 1. amlodipine 5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
3. mirtazapine 15 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] senior living  Discharge Diagnosis: Adenocarcinoma of gallbladder: unresectable E coli bacteremia Thalassemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: Please call Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4727**] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] for fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, increased abdominal pain, incisional redness, drainage or bleeding or other concerning symptoms.
Please consult with patients PCP regarding [**Name9 (PRE) 11132**] this medication, not continued due to fall risk.
