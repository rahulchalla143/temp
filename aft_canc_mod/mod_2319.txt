He denied syncope or lightheadedness but reported mild SOB and fatigue.
His last dose of irinotecan and panitumab chemotherapy was Monday [**2134-3-29**] (patient reports was [**4-12**] but not recorded in OMR), and he reports always getting diahrrea with his chemotherapy.
HIs bowel movements are not bloody or melanaic.
He has been taking immodium and diphenoxylate-atropine without improvement.
Sunday night, he reports acute worsening of his diahrrea, which continued through Monday.
CT torso was without PE or dissection, but did have multiple stable pulmonary nodules, and a small right pleural effusion.
He also had stable metastatic disease.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: Adenocarcinoma of the rectum - [**6-/2131**]:  The patient presented with a change in bowel habits and was noted to have an abnormal rectal exam by his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 39262**] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] gastrointestinal evaluation.
- [**2131-7-23**] colonoscopy:  Exophytic cancer of the rectum [**9-9**] cm above the anal margin.
Polyp:  Adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.
- [**2131-7-25**] rectal ultrasound:  T3 posterior midline tumor with luminal narrowing of the rectum.
- [**2131-8-2**] CT scan of the torso:  Irregular, polypoid lesion seen within the rectum, with multiple subcentimeter presacral and pericolic lymph nodes identified.
Two pulmonary nodules seen in the left lower lobe, the largest measuring 2.9 x 2.2 cm.
Multiple low-attenuation lesions seen within the liver, the largest of which may represent cyst, smaller lesions are not fully characterized.
Low-attenuation lesions seen within the left kidney, possibly a cyst, although too small to characterize.
- [**2131-12-10**]:  Proctosigmoidectomy with stapled coloanal anastomosis and diverting loop ileostomy.
Pathology revealed adenocarcinoma of the rectum, low-grade, with invasion into the perirectal adipose tissue and metastasis to 7 of 13 regional lymph nodes (T3N2).
There is a new FDG-avid focus in segment 4A of the liver which most likely represents metastasis.
- [**2132-2-13**]: Ileostomy takedown with simultaneous flexible bronchoscopy and VATS with left lower lobe resection.
Pathology from the ileostomy stoma demonstrated no evidence of malignancy.
The left lower lobe wedge resection demonstrated an adenocarcinoma, 4.1 cm, consistent with metastasis of rectal origin.
- [**2132-2-14**]: Evaluation by the hepatobiliary surgery consult team due to the finding on his recent PET scan of a likely liver metastasis.
It was felt that the lesion was amenable to surgical resection, and it was planned that the patient would undergo two cycles of chemotherapy prior to proceeding with hepatic resection.
- [**2132-7-11**]: Hepatic resection of a 1.7cm segment 4a metastatic lesion by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Oxaliplatin eliminated due to neuropathy.
- [**2132-11-26**]: Hospital admission for SVC syndrome secondary to a catheter-associated thrombus causing occlusion of the SVC and bilateral brachiocephalic veins.
The patient underwent TPA infusion followed by venous angioplasty with balloon dilation with resolution of symptoms.
- [**2133-8-3**]: Initiation of ininotecan for recurrent disease.
- [**2134-2-8**]: Due to laboratory and radiographic evidence of disease progression, cetuximab was added to ininotecan; due to an allergic reaction, cetuximab was changed to panitumumab on [**2134-2-16**].
ASCVD, status post MI in [**2111**].
Family History: The patient's paternal uncle had an abdominal cancer, details unknown.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1683**] is a 72 yo M with h/o metastatic rectal CA and SVC syndrome, now resolved on lovenox tx, who was admitted to OMED on [**4-19**] with intractable diarrhea thought [**3-2**] chemo and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**4-24**] with BRBPR and hematemesis.
This was thought due to irinotecan induced GI toxicity.
They were concerned that patient's whole GI tract was diffusely inflamed as was seen on EGD and that the anastamotic site from his colectomy might be a bleeding source; a flex sigmoidoscopy was done on as well and showed as well diffuse ulceration and inflammation.
Stool cultures revealed no evidence of infection.
The patient however despite aggressive crystalloid and colloid (albumin, a further 2 units of blood) resuscitation then developed sepsis related acute tubular necrosis.
The patient became anuric and nephrology was consulted.
The nafcillin was also changed to Cefazolin dosed 2mg at each [**Date Range 2286**] session for ease of administration and avoiding extra volume loading.
#Hypotension/Tachycardia: In setting of extensive diahrrea.
Ct torso is without PE or dissection.
Once he had an episode of BRBPR, he became tacycardic to the 140s, with BP 90s/60s.
s/p TPA infusion followed by venous angioplasty with balloon dilation with resolution of symptoms.
He was initially treated with lovenox (dose recalculated this admission, should be lower than his admission dose), but this was held secondary to GI bleed.
#Diarrhea - the patient continued to have diarrhea that was controlled with titration of his anti-diarrheal medications.
Infectious sources were ruled out and the cause was likely irinotecan-induced GI toxicity and radiation proctitis.
#Generalized anasarca - The patient was noted to have an extremely low albumin on admission, likely related to poor nutrition due to his GI pathology.
During volume resuscitation the patient became grossly edematous, and albumin was administered to little effect.
This demonstrated no evidence of clot.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 979**] - [**Location (un) 246**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Rectal cancer Diarrhea Sepsis Acute Renal Failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with diarrhea.
You also have a low blood pressure on admission, this was likely due to dehydration in the setting of diarrhea, and it improved with rehydration with IV fluids.
Your diarrhea then became bloody, and you also had an episode of vomit with blood in it.
You had an upper endoscopy and a sigmoidoscopy, which showed ulceration in your esophagus, stomach and colon.
This was thought to be due to the chemotherapy and radiation that you have been receiving for your colon cancer.
While admitted, you also had a severe bacterial infection that got into your blood.
