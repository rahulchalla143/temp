Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was admitted with a chief complaint of increasing lethargy.
This 76-year-old man has a history of advanced Parkinsons, bladder cancer, hypertension, presented with increasing lethargy, decreased po intake and recent fall related to weakness.
He had difficulty walking and a subsequent fall four days prior to admission.
Denies any head trauma or loss of consciousness.
Then over the last 3-4 days prior to admission the patient had decreased po intake, increasing lethargy and some confusion.
The patient's son denies any visible rigors or chills, denies any noted fevers, has not had recent cough, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
The patient became increasingly lethargic.
In the Emergency Room he had junctional bradycardia to the low 40's and that EKG was fast by the cardiology fellow on call.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As mentioned, significant for advanced Parkinson's, bladder cancer, carcinoma in situ, status post BCG, enlarged prostate, question of prostate nodules and hypertension.
He is a generally ill appearing, frail elderly male who opened eyes to voice, with generalized stiffness.
Anicteric, dry mucus membranes, no oral lesions, no JVD, no lymphadenopathy.
Distant heart sounds.
Firm, nontender, non distended, no rebound or guarding, decreased bowel sounds.
No clubbing or edema, poorly perfused distal extremities with dopplerable pulses in all four extremities.
Chest x-ray showed hazy bibasilar opacifications, also with peripheral right opacification, no cardiomegaly, no effusions, left subclavian line was placed in the SVC.
CT of the head showed no acute intracranial processes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and he developed a myocyte necrosis and developed acute renal failure on top of the known prior renal function.
He was then extubated on [**3-24**] with increasing blood pressures after his sepsis from the pneumonia had been cleared.
Echocardiogram done on the patient found him to have a decent cardiac function with a normal LV up to 55% with left ventricular wall thickness cavity and systolic function being normal.
Aortic valve leaflets were mildly thickened.
There was mild 1+ aortic regurgitation seen and the mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened.
The patient, after being transferred to the floor on [**2157-3-25**], continued to have lethargy and increasing hypoxia on the floor and so he was readmitted back to the medical Intensive Care Unit on the 17th for an overnight stay.
His initial ABG was 7.33, 44 and 56, went up to 7.36, 44 and 54 and chest x-ray done on the 17th showed new bilateral pleural effusions with mild volume overload CHF, persistent left lower lobe opacity and right lower lobe opacity.
Cardiovascular:  Coronary artery disease, the patient ruled in for myocardial infarction but the echo showed no wall motion abnormality, likely from metabolic stress, therefore no angiography was indicated.
The Atenolol he had once he demonstrates blood pressure stability.
Electrophysiologically the patient had bradycardia which was thought to be due to metabolic process associated with the sepsis.
Congestive heart failure, the patient had significant pleural effusions, likely believed to be secondary to diastolic dysfunction.
Pulmonary:  The patient had pneumonia which was treated with antibiotics.
His oxygen saturation improved over time and the patient had a thoracentesis, diagnosed and therapeutic, on [**3-30**] where over a liter of the patient's thoracentesis fluid was removed and it was determined to be of a transudative nature consistent with the diastolic dysfunction believed from a cardiac analysis.
Renal:  Patient's hypernatremia was corrected gradually with D5W.
He had to be maintained on aspiration precautions because the patient was unable to pass his swallowing evaluation and so that is why on the [**5-30**] the patient had a PEG placed with a J tube extension so that the patient could receive his nutrition until his mental status improved to the point where he was able to protect his airway sufficiently to take in sufficient amount of food.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  In addition, there was also Atenolol 50 mg po q day which will be started once the patient's blood pressure reaches sufficient criteria of having a systolic blood pressure greater than 110, heart rate greater than 55 on a consistent basis.
