GI bleed: Patient has chronic GI bleed and requires chronic transfusions due to inability to sufficiently produce in the setting of myelodysplastic syndrome.
The patient had an EGD performed with 2 clips placed to an atral gastric ulcer (full report above).
The patient's goal hct was >28 given his extensive CAD history however this was felt to be unattainable due to his pre-existing MDS.
This was felt to be likely secondary to poor perfusion from a low hct.
Lasix (furosemide), aldactone (spironolactone) and metoprolol (lopressor) were held due to normal BP without these meds and it is recommended that he follow up with PCP prior to restarting these meds.
Myelodysplastic syndrome: - chronic thrombocytopenia and macrocytic anemia - continue f/u with outpatient hematologist; may need BM Bx as outpatient .
# CAD: No acute event noted.
