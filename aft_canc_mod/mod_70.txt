Admission Date:  [**2161-2-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2161-2-26**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5438**] Chief Complaint: hypotension, mental status changes, respiratory distress/failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: R-sided Femoral line R-PICC Tracheostomy Pleurex Catheter Placed-L sided   History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] yo M with hx of hypothyroidism, Afib, CAD, HTN, new diagnosis of GE junction lymphoma (s/p 3 months of radiation therapy with tumor size [**1-5**] as before but now no longer candidate for radiation therapy) who presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with call0in with tachypnea, RR 40's with frequent suctioning of very thick mucous.
Came from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with complaints of SOB and DOE.
He got Morphine 8mg po x 1 at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab prior to transfer and subsequently developed mental status changes.
Then, he was noted to have a poor gag reflex with RR 4 and thus was intubated for airway protection (getting succinylcholine and etomidate).
He was then started on dopamine via R. groin line and became tachycardic and was questionably was in VT and shocked 200J x 3 (no strips) and started on lidocaine and magnesium.
Per son, he states that his father had been coughing white, yellow sputum for about a week but did not complain of SOB or chest pain.
Transferred to MICU for further care for respiratory failure, and hypotension.
Past Medical History: Hypothyroidism, CAD s/p MI [**2142**], EF 45%, HTN, BPH, Depression, High cholesterol, GE Junction lymphoma, peripheral T cell lymphoma   Social History: Moved from [**Country 532**] 10 years ago former engineer wife with alzheimer's disease lives alone, walks with cane No ETOH, tobacco   Family History: No h/o CAD  Physical Exam: VS - T 98.3, BP 107/53, HR 62, RR 17, sats 100% on RA, wt 75.8kg Vent: AC, PEEP 8, Tv set 550/actual 618, RR set 12/actual 15, FiO2 100% I/O: 210 UOP since placing foley catheter Gen: Sedated, intubated.
No ecchymosis.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: [**Age over 90 **] yo M with hx of GE junction lymphoma (s/p radiation therapy for palliation), afib, hypothyroidism who presents with PNA and hypotension.
Hypotension - Likely secondary to medications given (morphine initially then versed in the setting of intubation).
Unlikely to be secondary to septic shock given that he was not initially hypotensive and only was hypotensive in the setting of lots of morphine and then lots of versed.
however, septic shock is possible given large PNA and UTI.
In MICU continued to be hypotensive requiring pressors-levophed.
Not thought to be septic shock micro data was negative throughout his hospitalization.
He was fluid resusitated however remained on pressors until [**2-23**], he was started on Hydrocort/fludrocort on [**2-21**] for adrenal insufficiency.
Mental status changes - Possibilities include infection with PNA and UTI, new hyponatremia in the setting of free water in his TFs (more likely to be the cause), medications including lots of morphine.
head CT negative for masses or bleeds; multiple lacunar infarcts present.
PNA with large effusion - likely cause of new tachypnea.
MICU course-pt was intubated for resp failure found to have large malignant effusions.
On CTA found to have small R-sided pleural effusions.
On CTA also found to have a deviated and narrowed trachea [**2-5**] metastatic lymphoma surrounding trachea and compromising airway.
On [**2-21**] he had 2nd pleurex cath placed and connected to suction with continual drainage.
He more likely had rapid afib with dopamine wiht underlying LBBB which made it look like VT.
however he went back into AF was initially put on BB without success.
Hyponatremia - unclear if from lots of free water from tube feeds.
Hyperkalemia - hemolyzed.
No peaked T-waves on EKG.
Throughout MICU course, no hyperkalemia.
8. hypothyroidism - continued levothyroxine.
has been getting palliative chemo but is no longer candidate for further radiation.Per oncologist and MICU team, multiple conversations had with family informing them of pt's extremely poor prognosis.
Per Oncologist, pt has days to weeks left given poor prognosis, metastatic lymphoma now encasing carotids/major vessels in neck as well as affecting/deviating trachea.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - [**Location (un) 550**]  Discharge Diagnosis: -GE Junction T Cell Lymphoma -Metastatic Mediastinal T cell Lymphoma with extensive lymphoma encasing Carotids and deviating Trachea -Malignant Pleural effusions -R sided small Pulmonary Embolisms -Atrial Fibrilation   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Pls continue pleurex cath to suction, may cap when output less than 200cc per day.
