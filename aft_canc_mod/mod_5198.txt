Vertebroplasty   History of Present Illness: 88 year old male with a history of prostate cancer, CVA, DM2, CEA and [**Hospital 2182**] transferred to the medicine service for further evaluation of a lung mass.
The patient was in his usual state of health until one month prior to admission when he developed upper extremity weakness, right more than left as well as bilateral shoulder pain and a cough.
He was admitted to an OSH and was found to have a LLL infiltrate and was treated for pneumonia and COPD flare.
At the rehab facility he continued to have upper extremity weakness and bilateral shoulder pain refractory to conservative measures.
His R hand weakness progressed and he was sent from rehab back to the OSH where he again had a MRI of his C-spine which showed interval progression of the compression fracture with retropulsion of the posterior fragment into the upper thoracic cord.
Additionally, a soft tissue mass anterior to the vertebral body brought up the possibility of metastatic disease.
His PSA remained flat at this time and a CT chest showed 2 LLL masses along with renal and thyroid cysts.
Incidentally, he was restarted on CTX/gentamycin at the OSH per family report because he developed fevers but they denied any other infectious symptoms at this time including SOB, cough, dysuria, or abdominal pain.
He did have mild diarrhea.
At [**Hospital1 18**], his films were reviewed by neurosurgery and no cord compression was noted.
His thoracic vertebral fracture was thought to be stable and he was fitted for a brace.
The patient was transfered to medicine for further work-up of his lung mass once acute neurosurgical issues were excluded.
He denies any CP, SOB, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or headache.
He does have some LE paresthesias and notes weakness in his R hand that is worse than baseline.
His family notes chronically loose bowels but states this has been worse of late and feels that his cognition has slipped over the past month.
HTN 2.
Prostate CA s/p XRT and since treated w/ lupron and zoladex 3.
CVA '[**92**] w/ residual R sided weakness 4.
COPD 9.
No exposure to chemicals.

There is no evidence of cord signal abnormality.
Degenerative changes within the cervical spine result in areas of spinal canal stenosis, as described above.
There is left pleural effusion and ill-defined mass in left lower lobe, which is better evaluated on prior CT scans.
Bone Scan ([**2193-2-26**]): No evidence of osseous metastatic disease.
Focal uptake in the lower neck likely correlates with T1 compression fracture on CT scan.
Multiple heterogeneously enhancing soft tissue masses within the posterior left lung likely centering within the pleura extending into the lateral chest wall and causing mild bony erosion.
A small linear calcification is noted adjacent to the pleura within the dominant mass suggesting possible mesothelioma.
Additional diagnoses within the differential include primary lung cancer or metastatic lesion from thyroid or renal cell carcinoma.
Heterogeneously enhancing middle mediastinal left thyroid lesion.
This likely represents a simple goiter but can be further evaluated with ultrasound if clinically indicated.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications.
T1 compression fracture with multilevel degenerative changes throughout the spine, including grade 1 anterolisthesis of L5 on S1 and mild posterior disc protrusion of L3-4 intervertebral disc.
Bronchial brushings and washings ([**2193-2-28**]): Negative for malignant cells.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CXR ([**2193-3-1**]): Large lower lobe consolidation.
This may be due to aspiration, hemorrhage, or pneumonia.
CXR ([**2193-3-2**]): Increased airspace opacity involving both lungs is new when compared to the previous chest radiograph and CT.
The finding represents mild pulmonary edema.
Previously identified bilateral lower lobe opacities are much less conspicuous on the current exam.
No pulmonary embolism.
New bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the left and small on the right.
Consolidation of the majority of the right lower lobe.
Increased consolidation surrounding the left lower lobe masses.
This may be infectious or due to aspiration.
No short interval change in the left lower lobe masses previously detailed on the study from five days ago.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
2) 4.1-cm mass centered in the expected position of the upper lobe of the left thyroid/supraclavicular region.
It is impossible to tell on the current study whether this lesion is exophytic from the left lobe thyroid or represents supraclavicular adenopathy, though the former appears more likely in correlation with the recent CTA chest.
No change in large soft tissue mass in the left lower lobe with extension/invasion into adjacent chest wall, pleural effusion, and infrahilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Decreased right pleural effusion and improved right basilar atelectasis/consolidation.
No hemorrhage or mass effect.
Old bilateral basal ganglia and left cerebellar infarcts.
T1 compression fracture: the patient was initially evaulated by neurosurgery who did not feel that the patient had new weakness or evidence of spinal cord compression.
After that, the patient was able to be changed to a small soft collar, but had very little palliation from the procedure.
LLL mass: likely primary lung cancer, however, no definitive tissue pathology was obtained despite several attempts including transbronchial biopsy.
DDx included thyroid and renal cell cancers, and the patient does have a large thyroid nodule which was unable to be biopsied secondary to his neck fracture constraints.
Post obstructive pneumonia: The patient was intermittently febrile throughout the hospitalization and was found to have a postobstructive pneumonia.
Chest PT was not able to be done given the constraints of his neck fracture.
On the day of discharge, he was febrile to 102 after a long period of being afebrile with a resolving leukocytosis.
Atrial fibrillation: the patient developed new onset atrial fibrillation during the hospitalization around the time of his transbronchial biopsy.
Hypoxia: the patient was intermittently hypoxic during the initial period of his hospitalization from the large LLL mass, post obstructive pneumonia/mucus plugging, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and intermittent volume overload.
He would have a tendency to desaturate overnight, but would respond to increased oxygen and diuresis if overloaded.
At discharge, the patient had a much improved requirement  of 2 liters by nasal cannula.
Anemia of chronic inflammation: stable at his baseline hematocrit of 28-30. .
PSA flat despite evidence of metastatic disease.
Uncontrolled sugars in the setting of steroids for pain control.
Pain and Palliation: Palliative care consulted given that the patient's pain was difficult to control.
No acute issues.
Palliative care followed closely in the management of this patient and helped the family cope with the new diagnosis and complications.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: community hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: T1 compression fracture Lung mass, likely NSCLC Shoulder Pain Hypertension Diabetes mellitus Prostate Cancer CVA with residual R weakness s/p Nephrectomy GIB Carotid endarterectomy COPD Shoulder OA Glaucoma   Discharge Condition: Stable.
