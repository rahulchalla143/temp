Mild congestive failure with cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusion.
Continued right perihilar mass corresponding to the patient's history of small cell lung cancer.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 68 yo female with DM, CRI, HTN, recently diagnosed stage IIIa SCLC on chemo p/w tumor lysis, s/p CVVH now on hemodialysis.
1 Acute Renal failure- pt with underlying diabetic nephropathy, baseline creatinine 1.0-1.2.
Now with acute on chronic renal failure.
Likely [**2-19**] cisplatin toxicity, possible tumor lysis, and ATN.
She is s/p CVVH for hyperurecemia and hypercalcemia which had to be stopped secondary to clotted lines.
Azotemia slowly resolved over the course of her stay and she began making urine.
She was initially on sevelamer and aluminum hydroxide for hyperphosphatemia which were d/cd when phosphate levels returned to [**Location 213**].
She was started on calcium carbonate for persistently low free calcium which also had to be repleted IV.
[**Name (NI) 102273**] Pt had a pancytopenia from cisplatin/etoposide.
Cisplatin usually has a biphasic elimination profile at 24 hours and 5 days and usually one does not get neutropenia so early.

N/V- likely secondary to chemotherapy and renal failure.
Lung cancer- with recently diagnosed IIIa SCLC s/p cisplatin and etoposide as above.
C diff came back positive and it was thought that it was a combination of c. diff + lung ca.
[**Name (NI) 12329**] Held pt's hyzaar (HCTZ/losartan) given renal failure and eventually also d/cd verapamil as pt's BP was ~100 without medications.
