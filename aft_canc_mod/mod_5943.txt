He was alert to person and to place with an expressive aphasia.
He had dry mucous membranes.
His cardiac exam had an irregular rate, tachycardic, with a clear S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
On pulmonary exam, he had left mid-lung crackles without wheezes.
His extremeties were warm without cyanosis, 2+ pitting edema bilaterally, and his distal pulses were 2+ bilaterally.

---- Date: [**2173-11-26**] Signed by [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 57715**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 15102**], CCC-SLP on [**2173-11-26**] Affiliation: [**Hospital1 18**]   Title: REPEAT BEDSIDE SWALLOWING EVALUATION BEDSIDE SWALLOWING EVALUATION:  HISTORY: Returned today to reattempt the consult for this [**Age over 90 **] year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2173-11-22**] for ARF and rapid ventricular rate a-fib, dehydration and pna.
PMH includes: CVA [**79**] yrs ago resulting in gait ataxia and dysarthria, PAF, h/o prostate cancer, frequent falls, a question of Parkinsonism, w/recent admit ([**2173-11-1**]) for multiple recent falls and for rehab placement.
Pt's language was notable for perseverative jargon with occasional words interspersed, but not appropriate to context.
No residue noted with purees or with liquids, again once the pt swallowed them.
Laryngeal elevation appeared to palpation and timely, when the pt was awake.
No overt cough, throat clear or change in vocal quality noted however.
SUMMARY / IMPRESSION: Pt is not demonstrating any overt s/s aspiration at b/s, however the pt is NOTABLY LETHARGIC, and FALLS ASLEEP WITH FOOD/LIQUID IN HIS MOUTH, placing him at risk for aspiration.
However, given effort of chewing, this may actually increase fatigue and place him at further risk for decreased po intake and falling asleep while eating.
Lastly, left a basic communication board with pt at b/[**Name Initial (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **] RN's request, however the given pt's h/o macular degeneration and current altered MS, he is not likely to engage in this as alternate communication means.
2.PO meds as tolerated, with purees or liquids.
5.Maintain basic aspiration precautions.
---- Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2173-11-27**]    OBJECT: [**Age over 90 **]-YEAR-OLD MAN WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATION AND A PACEMAKER WITH A HISTORY OF APHASIA NOW WITH WORSENING APHASIA.
REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Doctor Last Name **]   FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: There is mild to moderate amplitude, intermittent mixed theta and delta frequency slowing seen independently in the fronto-central regions, more so on the right.
ABNORMALITY #2: There is occasional low amplitude generalized delta frequency slowing.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Shows a wide complex rhythm with a rate of 90 bpm and frequent ectopy.
IMPRESSION: This is a mildly abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of independent mixed delta and theta frequency slowing seen over the fronto-cental regions, more so on the right.
This finding suggests subcortical dysfunction in the these regions and it is a relatively non-specific finding with regard to an evaluation for  seizures.
In addition, occasional low amplitude generalized delta frequency slowing was seen, which suggests deep midline subcortical dysfunction.
No epileptiform abnormalities were seen.
Note was made of a wide complex rhythm with ectopy on the cardiac monitor.
INTERPRETED BY: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] W.  ----   Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: [**Age over 90 **] year old former physician with [**Name Initial (PRE) **] history of prostate cancer, stroke, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who was recently discharged to [**Hospital1 100**] REhabilition Center for the Aged after an admission ofr frequent falls admitted with atrial fibrillation in the setting of pneumonia.
Atrial fibrillation was not controlled with medical medical management and the improvement of the patient's pneumonia, so the patient had AV nodal ablation and placement of a dual chamber pacemaker.
He was [**Hospital 35261**] transferred from the cardiac care unit to the medicine service for a change in mental status involving somnolence and worsened aphasia which resolved after continuation of the medication abilify.
At that time, he became hypotensive and required a dopamine drip for less than a day to maintain a MAP of 60.
The morning of [**11-13**], he reverted to atrial fibrillation.
He remained in sinus rhythm until the morning of [**11-18**] when he reverted to atrial fibrillation.
Acute Renal Failure: On admission, he appeared intravascularly dry on physical exam.
He was gently hydrated with 800 cc of IV fluids even though he had known poor left ventricular function.
He was subsequently started on a nesiritide drip due to an increase in CHF.
His acute renal failure improved with the nesiritide treatment over the course of 3 days.
Heart Failure:  On admission, he had evidence of mild pulmonary edema on chest x-ray.
The next day, he had evidence of increased pulmonary edema.
Change in mental status:   Later in his hospitalization, the patient experienced mental status changes including excessive somnolence, worsening Wernicke's aphasia and worsening paraphasia and neologisms.
The mental status changes were reminiscent of the patients recent stroke months prior to admission and were thought to represent recrudescence of prior stroke symptoms in the setting of illness.
These mental status changes resolved with discontinuation of Abilify.
Head CT documented stable, old left lentiform nucleus lacunar infarction, no new acute stroke, and no further change in a chronic bifrontal subdural hematoma that had previously demonstrated small interval increase.
Portable EEG documented a mildly abnormal EEG likely suggestive of subcortical dysfunction in the right fronto-central and deep midline subcortical regions but was non-specific for an evaluation of seizure.
No epileptiform abnormalities were seen on EEG.
The patient had no signs or symptoms of meningismus and an LP was not thought to be of clinical utility.
It was also considered that the patient might have a neuroleptic hypersensitivity disorder, but this finding is often seen in the context of [**Last Name (un) 309**] body dementia and the patient did not have hallucinations, altered sleep-wake cycle, or other findings that would support this diagnosis.
Coronary Artery Disease: He has no history of coronary artery disease.
Pneumonia:  On initial presentation, he had focal rhonchi in the left mid lung field with a productive cough.
Hematuria: On [**2173-11-16**], he had gross hematuria without clots.
However, after pacemaker placement, he did receive 48 hours of vancomycin, which would also have covered this asymptomatic bacturia.
Left hand thrombophlebitis: Treated with a 2-day course of vancomycin and later iwth a 5-day course of keflex, due to finish [**2173-12-3**] after discharge to prevent any ascending infection of an ipsilaterally place pacemaker.
KUB was ordered secondary to abdominal distention, which later improved on an increased bowel regimen.
The patient developed right hand swelling and hand radiography documented scapholunate advance collapse (SLAC) fracture in the hand.
He required lowering of his phosphorous and repletion of potassium and magnesium during this admission.
Speech and swallow consultation documented that the patient was safe to swallow ground solids and nectar thickened liquids but needed frequent arousal often to prevent falling asleep before swallowing.
Chronic anticoagulation with warfarin or heparin was considered to not be in the patient's long-term interest because of his fall risk and because of the increased risk of these medications worsening a chronic subdural hematoma.
He has follow-up appointments scheduled and will, however require glucose monitoring in the week following discharge to monitor for hypoglycemia following institution of glucotorl XL as above.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - [**Location (un) 550**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Atrial Fibrillation Acute Renal Failure Congestive Heart Failure Pneumonia Chronic subdural hematoma   Discharge Condition: Stable and improved.
