He has had 3 falls since [**Month (only) 205**] due to his difficulty with balance, the last fall was this week.
Significant medical history includes left testicular mass removal in [**2145**] that was diagnosed as malignant lymphoma, large B cell.
Past Medical History: HTN, CAD, s/p MI [**5-/2156**], lymphoma since [**2145**]-testicular mass orchiectomy (Malignant lymphoma, predominantly large cell type of B-cell lineage)Blepharitis,inguinal hernia repair,Hyperlipidemia, STEMI LAD drug eluting stent,leukocytosis (leukocyte counts between 11.3-18.5) kappa restricted B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder .
# Dyslipidemia - the patient refuses lipid-lowering therapy.
# Hypertension # Emphysema (per CT on [**4-19**]) # ?Interstitial lung disease (per CT on [**4-19**]) # CLL/SLL # s/p orchiectomy of L testes with atypical cellular infiltrate initially though large B cell lymphoma but may have been [**Doctor Last Name 6261**] transformation # Blepharitis # Status post inguinal hernia repair  Social History: Lives with wife of 57 years - wife very involved.

Pertinent Imaging: MRI Head [**12-4**]: Apprx 6.7cmX6.8cm right frontal lobe mass, with surrounding mass effect.
Approximatley 8mm of leftward subfalcine herniation.
Post-Biopsy CT of Head [**12-5**]: Expected postsurgical changes s/p stereotactic biopsy .
Bone marrow biopsy: SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY: DIAGNOSIS: MILDLY HYPERCELLULAR MARROW WITH MATURING TRILINEAGE HEMATOPOIESIS AND PERSISTENT INVOLVEMENT BY CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA/SMALL LYMPHOCYTIC LYMPHOMA.
Note: The extent of infiltration by chronic lymphocytic leukemia appears decreased in comparison with the most recent biopsy.
Concurrent flow cytometry demonstrates a population of lymphocytes with an immunophenotype consistent with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
He was found to have a very large right frontal mass and due to his history of lymphoma he was not placed on steroids.
The preliminary pathology was consistent with lymphoma and he was started on dexamethasone intra-operatively.
The procedure went well with no complications.
The post-op head CT showed no hemorrhage.
He continued to have very poor vision in the right eye but otherwise he was neurologically intact.
Since the patient was neurologically stable and there was no further neurosurgery that could be offered the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] on the oncology service for urgent treatment for brain lymphoma.
Transfer - Medicine [**2157-12-6**]: Pt is a 61 yo male with hx of large B cell lymphoma of the testis and CLL/SLL by BM biopsy who presents with decreased visual acuity and difficulty with balance since [**Month (only) 205**] of this year.
MRI with 7x7cm mass in right frontal lobe s/p stereotatic brain biopsy.
#Right Frontal Lobe Brain Mass/Lymphoma: On transfer to medicine patient was continued on Dexamethasone 4mg Q6hrs, Dilantin 100mg TID, and Q4hour neurologic exams.
On transfer the patient's only neurologic deficit was decreased visual acuity in the right eye.
Patient's neurologic exam throughout hospitalization remained unchanged - with the only deficit being decreased visual acuity in the right eye.
The patient was re-started on ASA (but at lower dose of 81mg daily instead of 325mg daily) but the plavix continued to be held (given concern for decreasing platelets in the setting of MTX therapy), as per the neurosurgical note and email discussion with the patient's primary cardiologist at [**Hospital1 18**].
Once the MTX level had decreased substantially in the patient, he was discharged, with close oncologic follow-up.
Pt with Neurosurgery appointment as outpatient for suture removal.
Patient had no chest pain while hospitalized.

Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel lightheaded or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.
Loss of vision, either partial or total.
Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.
Severe sensitivity to light.
Severe headache or change in headache.
Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
New onset of seizure or change in seizure, or seizure from which you wake up confused.
Due to the complexity of neurosurgical procedures and treatment of neurosurgical problems, effective advice regarding emergency situations cannot be given over the telephone.
Should you have a situation which is not life-threatening, but you feel needs addressing before normal office hours or on the weekend, please present to the local emergency room, where the physician there will evaluate you and contact us if needed.
Please avoid vitamin C (ascorbic acid) in your diet, as this interacts with the chemotherapy you took.
If you developed fever, chills, chest pain, difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, change in vision, change in balance, confusion, or other symptoms that concern you, please call your doctor or return to the hospital.
?You have an appointment for suture removal TOMORROW on [**2157-12-15**] in Dr.[**Name (NI) 9034**] office which is located in the [**Hospital Unit Name 3269**], [**Hospital Unit Name 12193**].
