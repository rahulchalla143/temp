Admission Date:  [**2124-4-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2124-5-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2064-10-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Carboplatin / Ibuprofen  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 158**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2124-4-12**]: Exploratory laparotomy with extended right colectomyand end ileostomy   History of Present Illness: 59yo G0 with metastatic papillary serous ovarian CA transferred from OSH.
Pain started as vague discomfort, but progressed to pain throughout that was sharp, intermittent, exacerbated by movement.
The colorectal surgical service was consulted for the radiologic findings, she was made NPO, had NGT placed with return of bilious fluid.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: -Recurrent metastatic ovarian CA s/p TAH/BSO debulking and chemo.
She was initially diagnosed with stage IIC ovarian cancer at the time of exploratory laparotomy on [**2118-7-19**].
CT scan showed no convincing areas of disease.
The patient underwent laparoscopic evaluation by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] where multiple tiny peritoneal implants were seen and biopsy was consistent with recurrent adenocarcinoma ovarian primary.
She had been stable until [**4-30**] when she developed abominal pain, concern for acute appendicitis, and underwent lap appy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1924**] which revealed several carcinoma implants along both hemidiaphragms, the right lobe of the liver, and the lower abdomen on the sigmoid colon and appendix; she also had a small amount of ascites.
Physical Exam: Admission: PE: T 99.3 HR 103 BP 122/78 RR 20 O2st 96% on RA NAD RRR, mildly tachycardic Lungs CTAB Abdomen tender to palpation throughout, tender to percussion.
No rebound but with voluntary guarding.
ICU ADMISSION: Vitals: T: afebrile BP: 107/68 P: 84 R: 20 O2: 98%(RA) General: Sleepy but arousable, and once aroused, able to interact but falls asleep once stimulation decreases; oriented to self, month, hospital; looks older than stated age HEENT: Sclera anicteric, dry MM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Anteriorly CTAB, but not taking large breaths CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  Ostomy in place without drainage, vertical incision with bandage overlying and retention sutures in place; +BS, non-distended, diffuse TTP without worsening when shake bed GU: foley in place Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: MS as above, following simple commands and moving all extremities.
No overt radiologic evidence of small-bowel obstruction or ileus 2.
Nasoenteric tube with the tip likely projecting over the region consistent with body of the stomach.
New moderately large left and small right pleural effusion with left lower lobe atelectasis.
-[**4-13**] Renal U/S: No evidence of hydronephrosis in bilateral kidneys.
-[**4-16**] CXR: Increased density at the left base consistent with parenchymal consolidation.
Bilateral pleural effusions may obscure the underlying pulmonary opacities.
There is no definite change.
Partially rim-enhancing fluid collection within the anterior midline abdomen in close proximity to the transverse colon surgical chain sutures.
No findings of bowel obstruction or leak.
While this may represent post-procedural change, underlying peritoneal disease is also possible in this patient with known metastatic disease.
Renal cysts including a hyperdense cyst off the left lower pole.
Bibasilar atelectasis with small left pleural effusion.
-[**4-23**] CXR: In comparison with study of [**4-16**], the right base shows substantial clearing with moderate atelectatic streaking and probable small effusion.
On the left, however, there is still extensive opacification consistent with pleural effusion, atelectasis, and possibly supervening pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
Slight interval decrease in size to partially organized intra-abdominal fluid collection within the midline abdomen which is of higher density today and may suggest decreasing phlegmon or evolving hematoma.
A small amount of air within this collection is likely related to recent attempted aspiration.
No new fluid collections or extraluminal oral contrast is present.
Persistent edema and wall thickening involving the visualized large bowel, most pronounced in the region of the splenic flexure.
Slight interval worsening of small bowel wall thickening and mesenteric induration in the left upper quadrant.
This may reflect postoperative change, serositis, and/or tumor infiltration.
No bowel obstruction.
Interval increase in moderate-size simple left pleural effusion resulting in complete atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
The pre-existing right pleural effusion has almost completely resolved.
The pre-existing left pleural effusion shows a slightly different distribution but is overall unchanged in extent.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
No pulmonary embolism.
Moderate left and trace right pleural effusions with overlying pulmonary atelectasis.
Bilateral prominent hilar lymph nodes as well as numerous, though not frankly enlarged upper mediastinal and supraclavicular lymph nodes.
Close attention to these areas is recommended given the history of known malignancy.
-[**4-26**] CT abd: Limited study without intravenous or enteric contrast demonstrating post-operative changes with no definable intra-abdominal fluid collection for drainage.
-[**5-1**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the pre-existing left pleural effusion is unchanged.
A minimal right pleural effusion is newly visualized.
Moderate bilateral basal atelectasis.
No pulmonary edema.
No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia  -[**5-1**] CT chest:1.
Despite evidence of aspiration, attributable to the over distended esophagus, the large areas of consolidation at the lung bases, by virtue of their persistence and relative homogeneity, are indistinguishable as either atelectasis alone or atelectasis and pneumonia.
There is no pneumonia in the upper or middle lobes.
Persistent bilateral pleural effusion, moderate on the left and small on the right.
Mild pulmonary edema and increased bilateral pleural effusions.
Bilateral lower lobe bronchial mucoid impaction and atelectasis; superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
Intact Hartmann pouch, with apparent mild wall thickening.
Please correlate for inflammatory or infectious colitis.
Mild ascites, partially loculated in anterior omentum.
Irregular enhancement may represent inflammation or peritoneal metastasis.
Emphysema and pulmonary hypertension.
Small left pleural effusion and left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, similar or possibly slightly worse.
Interval resolution right effusion, but new plate-like right base atelectasis .
Extensive acute and organizing serositis.
C.  Focal serosal carcinoma consistent with patient's known serous ovarian carcinoma.
Terminal ileum, resection (J-L): Acute and organizing serositis .
Pleural fluid [**5-2**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 64294**] is a 59yo woman with metastatic papillary serous ovarian CA who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] with SBO.
This surgery was reported to be uneventful with minimal blood loss but some intra-peritoneal intra-peritoneal spillage.
She was transferred to ICU for post-op monitoring given severity of comorbidities.
Her pain was treated with a Dilaudid PCA and she was kept NPO with TPN post-surgery.
The patient remained hypoxic after her surgery, with high supplemental oxygen need, thought to be due to splinting from abdominal pain as well as pneumonia; she was treated with antibiotics as above.
She initially had acute renal failure with poor urine output but this improved with volume resuscitation.
This patient has known metastatic ovarian cancer and was on weekly Avastin/Taxol prior to GI perforation.
On [**2124-4-19**], the superior pole of the abdominal incision was noted to be erythematous with clear drainage.
Gram stain showed no organisms.
Given the appearance of the wound and persistent elevated EBC count, CT abdomen was performed to assess for abdominal fluid collection which revealed a small anterior fluid collection in the superior abdomen.
Follow up CT scans were performed to see progression of collection with gradual resolution noted on imaging.
Over the next several days, superior abdominal wound opened further with fascial dehiscence noted in wound and drainage of purulent fluid.
As wound improved, persistent leukocytosis raised concern for cdiff colitis.
She was monitored closely with no change in respiratory function, though she was drowsy.
Once tizanidine wore off, she was active with no mental slowing.
On [**2124-4-26**], patient reported severe dyspnea and tachycardia and a CTA chest was performed to rule out PE.
Scan was negative and patient's dyspnea was releived with nebulizer treatments and supplemental oxygen.
A similar episode occured on [**2124-5-1**], and a repeat CTA chest was performed in light of patient's high risk due to cancer, and immbolization.
On [**2124-5-2**], interventional pulmonology was consulted for therapeutic thoracentesis of left pleural effusion in hopes of improving patient's dyspnea.
400 cc of seroud fluid was drained, with no bacterial growth, and chemistries consistent with transudate.
Her dyspnea improved significantly after this, though she occasionally had episodes of dyspnea and tachycardia, presumably from anxiety.
Over the next 4-5 days, patient's leukocytosis stabilized around 16 and her oxygen requirement resolved.
She was discharged on hospital day#28/post-operative day #26 in stable condition: afebrile, able to eat regular food, under adequate pain control with oral medications, and ambulating with PT and urinating without difficulty.
