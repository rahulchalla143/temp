Admission Date:  [**2191-11-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2191-12-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2135-3-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: A 56-year-old gentleman with a history of IgG multiple myeloma who is approximately three months following  an autologous stem cell transplant admitted with progressive fatigue, shortness of breath and inability to ambulate.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**11-24**]-Thoracentesis   History of Present Illness: 56 yo male with PMH of multiple myeloma who was recently admitted with a pericardial effusion and tamponade (pulsus reportedly 24 mmHg) s/p pericardiocentesis and balloon pericardiotomy presents with increased shortness of breath.
Of note during the last admission, he was also found to have a large left pleural effusion on CT chest, but refused thoracentesis at that time.
He does report some cough productive of yellow sputum.
Of note he also reports increasing lower extremity weakness to the point that he was unable to get to his outpatient oncology appointment for his dose of [**Month/Day (4) **].
He denies bowel/bladder incontinence, urinary retention, numbness, tingling, or burning.
He also reports that his back pain is unchanged and remains a [**6-25**] decreased to [**1-18**] /10 with oxycontin and oxycodone.
Past Medical History: 1.Plasma cell myeloma   Mr. [**Known lastname 54249**] is a 56-year-old gentleman who presented in [**2190-9-15**] with complaints of muscle pain between his shoulders and difficulty sleeping.
An x-ray performed at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital showed a large plasmacytoma in the posterior chest wall.
CT guided biopsy of the right posterior chest wall mass was consistent with a plasmacytoma.
Immunoperoxidase studies showed tumor CD-134 positive and containing monoclonal kappa and cytoplasmic immunoglobulin.
Bone marrow biopsy revealed 80% involvement with plasma cell myeloma.
Skeletal survey on [**2190-12-2**] showed no additional lytic lesions.
CT of the torso demonstrated a large mass in the right posterior mediastinum and hemithorax destroying the transverse process of the vertebral body of T3 and T4 and ribs at that level.
IgG at that time was 8703, an SPEP showed an abnormal band representing 58%, and beta 2 microglobulin was 3.4.
His speech was garbled and he had poor attention span.
He was admitted for further workup to rule out any neurologic developments.
Workup included an MRI, which showed only prominent ventricular sulci and an LP showing no changes consistent with infection.
He was negative for HSV and it was therefore felt that this was somewhat of his baseline neurologic  status in the setting of medication.
He then proceeded with cycle 2 of DVD chemotherapy.
He was also noted to have  an increasing neck mass.
A CT scan obtained at that time showed that he had some enlargement of the neck mass.
He had a single chest lesion that was somewhat smaller and another one at the rib that was somewhat larger.
He was then treated with radiation therapy to his neck following an MRI, which ruled him out for any spinal cord compression.
He otherwise had no other complications posttransplant, until the end of [**10-20**] when he was admitted with acute pericardial tamponade and recurrent mediastinal mass.
His pericardial fluid was negative for malignantcells.
During this hospitalization, a CT scan on [**11-11**] revealed a a large prevertebral soft tissue mass with anterior displacement of the esophagus and trachea, 4 x 2.5 cm in greatest dimensions.
Images of the upper thorax demonstrated massive mediastinal adenopathy.
A lucency in the C6 vertebral body, suggestive of a myeloma metastasis as well as an expansile lytic lesion of the right fourth rib, with extension into the right side of the T4 vertebral body.
Unfortunately, Mr. [**Known lastname 54249**] failed to show up for his [**Known lastname 4387**] appointments c/o progressive weakness.
History of viral encephalitis in 12/[**2177**].
10.Steroid induced diabetes.
11.History of pneumonia in 02/[**2190**].
3 children from previous marriage.

2) Slight interval decrease in size to small pericardial effusion.
Also, mild increase in size of large left pleural effusion.
[**2191-11-25**]: Non contrast head CT IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
[**2191-11-26**]: MRI spine: IMPRESSION: Diffuse bony and epidural tumor is evident on total spine MRI.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 56 year old male with PMH significant for relapsed multiple myeloma s/p auto BMT in [**7-/2191**] who presents with shortness of breath and lower extremity weakness.
#Shortness of breath - There were 3 concerning etiologies-tamponade, increasing pleural effusion, increasing mediastinal mass.
This was concerning in the setting of his recent cardiac tamponade, a TTE was done which was notable for improvement in the recent pericardial effusion and no evidence of tamponade.
--On admission, a CT of the chest was done which was notable for a stable mediastinal mass, but an increasing left pleural effusion which was already cited as large on the last admission.
The procedure team was consulted and a thoracentesis of the left pleural effusion was performed.
The procedure was complicated by a small pneumothorax which resolved with 100% FIO2 by face mask.
The patient became less short of breath after the therapeutic thoracentesis was performed.
The preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**] per pathology of the pleural fluid was positive for plasma cells.
No further management of the effusion or therapy for the shortness of breath was performed.
#LE Weakness - In the ED, the patient was seen by neurology who also noted asterixis in addition to proximal lower extremity weakness.
On HD 2, the patient had increasing lower extremity weakness and actually fell to the ground because his legs "buckled" underneath him.
Since weakness in his legs was worsening and conscious sedation by anesthesia could not be arranged for the same day, the patient was given 2.5 mg Xanax and sent down to MRI.
The patient refused the MRI when he got there because of pain and anxiety despite the xanax.
He was started on decadron (40 mg) for possible spinal cord compression due to the mediastinal mass/cervical mass.
Later that evening the patient became acutely agitated/violent and then within minutes became unresponsive for a period of 20 minutes.
During this time he was hemodynamically stable but exhibited no response to painful stimuli and no gag reflex.
After the episode he was confused, lethargic and disoriented.
He was seen by neuro who felt the presentation could be c/w a seizure and sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for observation.
A head CT was done which was negative for an acute bleed, mass or mass effect.
While the head MRI was negative for masses/lesions, the MRI of the spine was notable for diffuse bony and epidural tumor and cord compression, particularly at the C6 to T4 levels and from T6-7 to T9-10.
The patient had XRT x 2, but became more confused prior to the third session and began to refuse all therapies, including xrt and a central line placement.
#Pain control - On the first few days of admission, the patient's pain was fairly well controlled with oxycontin 60 mg [**Hospital1 **], with occassional oxycodone for breakthrough.
He was started on a 75 mcg fentanyl patch with a fentanyl pca for breakthrough.
As the patient's confusion progressed, he did not push the PCA button for medication and he refused peripheral access, so his regimen was changed to an increased dose of fentanyl by transdermal patch with roxinol for breakthrough pain.
on HD 6, there was no urine in the foley bag, so the foley was flushed and a clot was noted.
Red urine was in the bag after irrigation so a sample was sent for cytology.
A follow up CT scan of his chest suggested an increase in the mediastianl mass despite the two doses of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the patient was maintained on best supportive measures.
He was originally put on fentanyl patch with morphine for breakthrough pain, but his pain increased and he was eventually started on a morphine drip.
Compazine 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every 6-8 hours  as needed for nausea.
