Admission Date:  [**2147-5-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2147-5-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2101-2-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1271**] Chief Complaint: Headaches  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2147-5-15**]: Cerebral Angiogram with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**2147-5-16**]: Cerebral angiogram with embolization of brain tumor Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**2147-5-16**]: Craniotomy for Tumor Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**]   History of Present Illness: This is a 46 year old right handed man who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] for the evaluation of headaches.
Q waves are present in leads I, aVL and V4-V6 raising a question of a lateral myocardial infarction of indeterminate age.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
A 7 cm extra-axial, avidly enhancing, predominantly solid mass arising from the left para-sagittal frontal convexity, with significant mass effect and edema on the adjacent brain parenchyma.
A 12-mm rightward shift of midline structures, but without hydrocephalus.
Differential diagnosis favors meningioma, but also includes hemangiopericytoma or dural metastasis.
Tumor invasion into the anterior portion of the superior sagittal sinus and the frontal calvarium.
CXR [**2147-5-13**] The lungs are clear without infiltrate or effusion.
Cerebral angiogram [**2147-5-15**] [**Known firstname 86876**] [**Known lastname 86877**] underwent cerebral angiography which showed significant supply to the tumor from the left external carotid artery, right anterior cerebral artery and left anterior cerebral artery.
There is also some supply from the right external carotid artery.
The patient will undergo embolization just prior to surgery as embolization could result in a venous infarct and catastrophic swelling of the tumor.
MRI [**2147-5-16**] Planning study with no interval change in the large extra-axial enhancing mass in left frontal parasagittal region.
CT head [**5-17**] Post-operative changes including a large amount of pneumocephalus and bifrontal vasogenic edema with 2 mm rightward shift of normally midline structures and degree of mass effect on the anterior portions of the lateral ventricles, bilaterally, unchanged from the pre-operative study of some 12 hours earlier.
On [**5-14**], a slight left facial noted.
At this time with better characterization of the mass and vasculature, the risk of stroke was assessed to be very high.
He did well without complication and he was extubated and taken to the SICU.
He was neurologically intact and CT showed some pneumocephalus.
As such he was deemed fit for discharge to home and was given prescriptions and instructions for follow-up.
Have a friend or family member check the wound for signs of infection such as redness or drainage daily.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting >10 lbs, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion, lethargy or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
New onset of the loss of function, or decrease of function on one whole side of your body.
