No evidence of colitis or intra-abdominal abscess.
Multiple abdominal wall hernias, containing loops of small and large bowel as detailed above, without evidence of obstruction.
Right adrenal nodule, incompletely characterized, but likely reflects an adrenal adenoma.
Recommend comparison with outside studies to assess for interval changes in size.
Left renal cyst.

Colonoscopy Wednesday, [**2195-4-29**]: Impression: Ulceration, granularity, exudate and erythema in the cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon and sigmoid colon compatible with Crohn's disease, Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and descending colon, Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations: Please obtain MRI to evaluate for abscess/fistula.
If this does not show evidence of abscess, will proceed to treatment with IV steroids +/- remicaid.
No evidence of colitis or intra-abdominal abscess.
Multiple abdominal wall hernias, containing loops of small and large bowel as detailed above, without evidence of obstruction.
Right adrenal nodule, incompletely characterized, but likely reflects an adrenal adenoma.
Recommend comparison with outside studies to assess for interval changes in size.
Left renal cyst.
Diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.
MRI: Pelvis IMPRESSION: Small track, measuring 14 mm in depth, extending from the skin of the right thigh to the fascia abutting the gracilis, with no evidence of deeper extension and no evidence of fistula or abscess, as questioned.
Trace bilateral hydroceles.
X-ray Foot: FINDINGS: There is general soft tissue swelling.
Mild-to-moderate degenerative disease at the tibiotalar joint and talonavicular joint.

Brief Hospital Course: 56 year-old male with diverticulitis s/p partial colectomy x 2, history of multiple herniorraphies, recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease transferred from OSH for BRBPR and abdominal pain on [**2195-4-27**].
In the ED, he was hypotensive and tachycardia and required a brief stay in the MICU, after which he was transferred to the medicine service.
MICU COURSE =========== # Crohn's Disease:  Patient found to have severe crohn's dz on colonoscopy.
An MRI was done showing no fistulas or abscesses.
# Hypotension/Sinus tachycardia: Likely secondary to hypovolemia in the context of bleeding, decreased PO intake, fever.
Hypotension resolved with fluid boluses.
# BRBPR: Pt with significant bleeding causing hemodynamic instability.
Likely lower GI bleed given description of BRB with clots.
No leukocytosis.
Raised concern for infectious or inflammatory process-- especially given history of diverticulitis and Crohn's-- however no signs of abscess, colitis, or pericolic fat stranding on CT.  # Elevated creatinine: No history of chronic kidney disease.
Most likely represents prerenal acute renal failure in the setting of BRBPR.
He did not have any episodes of BRBPR.
Acute kidney injury was likely secondary to contrast-induced nephropathy.
On MRI patient was also noted to have a 14mm track extending from is right thigh to the underlying muscle.
There was no fecal output.
This was dressed daily, and the wound team was consulted for further recommendations (given risk of infection based on location).
On day prior to discharge patient also complained of right foot pain.
He injured the right ankle approximately 1.5 years ago; did not seek medical attention, and pain improved.
Worsening pain on plantar surface, medially of right foot throughout hospital course.
Most likely pain from soft tissue edema secondary to steroid use.
Plain film of the film showed no evidence of fracture.
The patient should have outpatient follow-up with the pain persists.
Secure dressing in underclothes or minimal softcloth tape   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) **] Nursing Association  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Crohn's flare - Acute kidney injury, likely secondary to contrast exposure  Secondary: - Epidermal retention cyst with draining tract in groin - Diabetes mellitus, type II - Right foot   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable; without blood in stools; ambulating without problem; afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2195-4-27**] due to blood in your stools due to a flare of your Crohn's disease.
You were also noted to have a worsening of your kidney function; this is likely related to contrast which your received for a CT scan, and should improve over time.
Note that we have stopped your diabetic pills, because of the acute renal failure (resolving) and the increased blood sugars due to prednisone.
If any changes are made in your prednisone dosing, you need to discuss with your doctor how to change the insulin-NPH dosing, because with less prednisone, you will need less NPH.
Please call your physician or return to the emergency department for increasing abdominal pain, blood in your stools, dark tarry stools, fever, or for any other symptoms which are concerning to you.
