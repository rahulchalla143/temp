Admission Date:  [**2172-2-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2172-2-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2104-12-24**]     Sex:  F   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema (forced expiratory volume 0.59) on home oxygen 2 liters nasal cannula and smokes two packs per day who infection symptoms for three days including a cough at baseline and sputum eight days prior Emergency Room admission on [**2172-2-6**] PEEP.
The patient was lethargic, somnolent, and had increased work of breathing with an oxygen saturation in the 60s and wheezing bilaterally.
Her arterial blood gas demonstrated a respiratory acidosis and hypocarbia.
She also complained of nonexertional/nonradiating chest pain with no ischemic changes on electrocardiogram.
Her chest x-ray was clear, hyperinflated lungs, no signs of congestive heart failure but a nasal swab that was positive for influenza.
She ruled out for myocardial infarction with negative creatine kinases, CK/MB, and C troponin.
On admission, her hematocrit was 55.4 and was 55.4 secondary to her history of polycythemia, and was due for a blood removal the day after admission.
Due to various blood draws, her hematocrit decreased to 44.1 by the time the patient was transferred from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the floor.
When the patient was transferred to the floor, the patient continued to have shortness of breath but was improving and became less dyspneic with activity such as moving in the bed and having bowel movements.
Her cough had decreased, but she was having difficulty coughing up her sputum.
The night before transfer to the floor, she had nonexertional chest pain for a couple of hours located to the right of the midline and also in the midline of her back.
The pain did not radiate, was constant, was relieved by Zantac.
Additionally, she reported abdominal pain the night before admission that was relieved by having a bowel movement, and she currently has a baseline intermittent constipation and diarrhea due to irritable bowel syndrome.
She was nauseated and wanted to vomit but has been unable to do so since her hernia repair.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   Dizziness when having a bowel movement, no visual changes, no headaches.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/emphysema; on home oxygen, smokes two packs per day, forced expiratory volume 0.59.
Bipolar disorder.
History of tuberculosis; childhood, has had no reactivation, plus purified protein derivative, status post treatment at age of five years old, multiple sputum negative for acid-fast bacillus.
Hernia repair.
Treatment for asthma in [**2141**].
Arterial repair of left arm laceration.
The patient was alert and oriented times three with labored breathing, and had difficulty in talking due to shortness of breath.
Oropharynx was nonerythematous without exudate.
Heart was regular in rate and rhythm with distant first heart sound and second heart sound.
No third heart sound or fourth heart sound, with a question of a systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border.
No gallops or rubs.
Pulmonary examination demonstrated coarse breath sounds with diffuse expiratory wheezes resonant on percussion extended bilaterally.
Abdomen had positive bowel sounds, was soft and nondistended, with mild tenderness in the epigastrium and right upper quadrant.
Extremities had no edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally and warm.
Strength was not tested due to dyspnea.
Urinalysis and urine sedimentation were negative for infection.
Sputum on [**2172-2-7**] demonstrated sparse growth or oropharyngeal flora.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray on [**2172-2-12**] demonstrated no pneumonia, no congestive heart failure, and no pneumothorax.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 76-year-old female with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, who smokes two packs per day, and is on home oxygen, who was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for respiratory failure due to a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare secondary to influenza infection and is now transferred to the Medicine Service after being weaned from BiPAP for continued management of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
PULMONARY:  The patient apparently on levofloxacin to prevent secondary bacterial pneumonia, status post influenza infection, and is on prednisone for treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
The levofloxacin was discontinued on hospital day two, and the patient continued to have baseline cough with baseline slight tan sputum.
The patient continued to have decreased oxygen saturations with activity, in which she varied between approximately 90% to 93% on 2 liters and 3 liters at rest, and decreased to 80% on 3 liters with movement.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had cardiomegaly on chest x-ray.
An echocardiogram was obtained to assess pulmonary arterial pressures as well as to determine if there was a right or left ventricular hypertrophy.
Echocardiogram demonstrated mild dilatation of the left atrium, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, with an ejection fraction of greater than 55%, a mildly dilated right ventricle with depressed systolic function, a mildly dilated abdominal aorta, and questionable impaired relaxation of the left ventricle.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient had constipation and alternating diarrhea due to her irritable bowel syndrome.
PSYCHIATRY:  The patient was continued on her psychiatric medications for her bipolar disorder.
The patient tended to become anxious when she had difficulty breathing, and Serax helped improve her symptoms of dyspnea.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home with a nebulizer machine from which she would take Atrovent and albuterol nebulizers in the a.m. and Atrovent and albuterol inhalers p.r.n.
