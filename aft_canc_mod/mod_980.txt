No evidence of an actively extravasating GI bleed.
Pancreatic tail lesion with multiple hepatic lesions, concerning for a primary pancreatic malignancy, possibly a neuroendocrine tumor, with hepatic metastases.
No evidence of portal or splenic vein thrombosis.
The tumor appears well defined and peripherally enhancing which is uncommonly seen in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
Cirrhotic liver and large amount of simple ascites; at the time of this study, a diagnostic paracentesis has been already performed.
# Tagged RBC scan No evidence of active GI bleeding during 90 minutes of imaging.
RUQ US IMPRESSION: Multiple hepatic lesions which are visualized on ultrasound and are amenable for ultrasound-guided liver biopsy.

# GIB:  The patient initially went to OSH for hematemesis and BRBPR.
The patient was hypotensive and required phenylepherine while in the unit.
An EGD was done in the MICU and no active source of bleeding was noted.
There were grade 1 varices found in the lower third of esophagus, which were not bleeding, and with no stigmata of recent bleed.
A Dileufoy's lesion was seen in the stomach that was also not actively bleeding, but 2 clips were still successfully placed.
Both CTA and tagged RBC scan were negative for any bleeding source, Colonoscopy showed external hemorrhoids, and portal enteropathy, non bleeding AVMs.
The patient was treated with Protonix [**Hospital1 **] and ceftriaxone for SBP ppx.
Patient was transferred to hepatorenal service with improved hemodynamics and with stable crit, he had no further GIBs.
# Cirrhosis - Presumably alcoholic.
Radiography and SAAG were consistent with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
Patient had paracentesis which removed 15L of fluid, was negative for SBP so Ceftriaxone reduce from 2mg to 1mg daily for ppx against GNR sepsis in setting of GIB.
# Atrial Fibrillation:  The patient was on beta blockers and digoxin for rate his atrial fibrillation; both were held while in the unit.
# CAD: While in the unit, the patient's aspirin, beta blocker were held in setting of GI bleed.
# Pancreatic mass with liver mets: Unclear etiology, Hepatic biopsy performed which showed adenocarcinoma consistent with pancreatic metastasis.
Given his rapidly accumulating ascites and pancreatis metastasis his prognosis is poor and he is beginning to transition to palliative care.
# Glaucoma complicated by retinal detachment:  The patient was continued on his home prednisolone and atropine eye drops.
Only medications discharged with included medications to keep him without symptoms.

You were admitted to [**Hospital3 **] [**Hospital **] Medical center after you had a significant GI bleed which required you to be in the MICU and receive many units of blood products.
You had a paracentesis which removed 13L of fluid so that a liver biopsy could be completed.
Biopsy showed adenocarcinoma which was most likely from your pancreas.
Your post-procedure course was uncomplicated and you had no further bleeds.
