While at [**Hospital1 **] he developed fever to 102.5 with associated nausea and vomiting and abdominal pain.
He was noted to be hypoxic and placed on NRB satting 94%, HR 160s increased from baseline 120s.
He continued to have fever and was noted to be "looking worse" prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
He reported fevers, chills, cough and shortness of breath.
He also noted abdominal pain.
Past Medical History: # Large B cell lymphoma, s/p sibling-matched allogenic SCT in [**6-/2167**] - c/b severe GVHD of skin, GI/mouth - had been receiving photopheresis - TPN dependent (via PICC) # Migraines # h/o vaso-vagal syncope with blood draws # h/o bacteremia # Steroid myopathy # Moraxella sinusitis # Cardiomyopathy - TTE [**4-5**] EF 45-50% - Likely multifactorial: chemotherapy, radiation, GVHD, tachycardia # Fungemia with [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29361**] ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: The patient was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in  [**9-/2165**] and treated with eight cycles of R-CHOP and 25 doses of  XRT, finished in 6/[**2165**].
In [**6-/2166**], relapsed with disease found in periaortic lymph nodes and in the spleen.
Follow up PET scan on [**2167-1-30**] demonstrated recurrent persistent uptake in the spleen, mesentery, and with new liver and pulmonary lesions.
Liver biopsy demonstrated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and he was treated with three weekly doses of Rituxan but continued to progress.
He has had severe chronic GVHD of the skin and oropharyngeal mucosa; he completed Rituxan weekly x4 for GVHD at end of [**2170-1-27**].
He has been out of work for several years due to his hospitalizations.
Family History: His paternal grandmother had breast cancer and a paternal uncle had cancer of an unknown etiology.
His father had diabetes and died of a myocardial infarction.
Dry mucous membranes Neck: Leathery skin, no apparent LAD.
Lungs: Decreased BS at bilateral bases, diffusely rhonchorous.
Cardiac: Tachycardic, regular, S1, S2, no m/g/r.
Abdomen: Firm to palpation, non-tender, non-distended, +BS, difficult to assess for HSM due to thickened skin.
Areas of hypo and hyperpigmentation over face, back, arms, abdomen.
New right lower lobe consolidation, concerning for pneumonia.
Markedly increased left-sided pleural effusion with consolidation.
Fluid- filled airways within LLL may represent aspiration or mucous impaction.
Stable multifocal bilateral opacities and ground-glass opacities.
No acute intra-abdominal pathology.
Multiple bilateral healing rib fractures.
Gallbladder appears normal without evidence of gallstones.
Diffuse mild increased hepatic echotexture consistent with diffuse fatty infiltration, although other advanced forms of liver disease such as cirrhosis or fibrosis cannot be excluded based on this study.
No acute intra-abdominal process.
Persisting left pleural effusion, with associated left lower lobe atelectasis.
Improvement of airspace opacity in the right lower lobe, with only residual patchy consolidation.
[**6-26**] Video Swallow Studie: Mild-to-moderate dysphagia with one episode of trace penetration and aspiration.
contrast in colon invokes patency.
In the absence of air in small bowel an obstruction of fluid filled loops cannot be excluded, but could be evaluated with CT if warranted.
[**7-25**] CT of head: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Right maxillary retention cyst and bilateral mastoid opacification, not adequately assessed.
Brief Hospital Course: 33yo M with large B-cell lymphoma s/p allogeneic stem cell transplant '[**66**], complicated by severe chronic Graft vs.
Prior to this admission pt was recently admitted ([**4-8**] - [**4-20**]) due to pneumosepsis and tx with ceftriaxone.
Pt was d/c and went to [**Hospital **] rehab, but he became hypoxic to low 90s, with lower BP, febrile to 102.5, HR 160s incr from baseline 120s, along with n/v and abdominal pain.
Pt was found to have new RLL consolidation and increased moderate left sided pleural effusion with compressive LLL atelectasis.
Thus pt was re-admitted (current admission) on [**5-19**] with pneumonia to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
He was admitted with a non-rebreather to keep 02 sats in 90s, but eventually went into respiratory failure, and intubated likely due to worsening hypoxia [**12-30**] pulm edema.
It was thought that this multifocal lung infection was likely due to Strep pneumoniae +/- Rhinovirus pneumonia.
Pt also had pain with swollowing, and switched to IV meds, and could not tolerate his Gleevac.
Once on the floor pt developed pancreatitis and transaminitis, although the lipase remained elevated pt eventually stopped complaining of mid-epigastric pain - but it was unclear to the team why these enzymes remained elevated.
Pt also has an elevated LDH - differential: wbc/rbc hemolysis vs PCP (but pt gets daily atorvoquone as prophylaxsis), and all appear unlikely - unknown why pt has elevated LDH, but may be related to above issue.
The pt's pneumonia is resolving well.
The latest CT chest on [**6-27**] showed "Marked improvement in bibasilar consolidation, with mild residual RLL abnormality with impacted bronchi and peribronchial infiltration.
No new consolidations.
Decreased but persistent moderate non-hemorrhagic left pleural effusion resulting in extensive left lower lobe atelectasis."
The main issue, prior to the pneumonia and currently, is his severe chronic GVH.
His GVH is causing (1) scleroderma-like, leathery, thickening of skin on his entire body leading to immobility and pain with movement from his tense skin, and (2) GI effects - pt originally had severe oral ulcerations now resolved, but currently continues to have aphagia and dysmotility.
[**Name (NI) 1917**] pt had abdominal pain at the skin around the PEG site.
This pain was separate from the pain he had from the pancreatitis, and was initially attributed to his associated skin tightening from GVH since it was worse with movement.
Pt had mild improvement with lidocaine patch, but the pain was severe and started on Morphine PCA, and as this was becoming an unresolving pain Pain Service recommended transitioning to methadone.
On [**6-22**] pt had CT Abd showing no acute intra-abdominal process.
Thus, we asked IR to perform a flow study to evaluate for impingement and patency (due to concurrent high-residuals from tube feeds - see below/next paragraph), and the study on [**6-26**] showed normal flow.
There was no change and on [**6-28**] swab was repeated again showing skin flora, but continued to have purulent discharge and mild erythema around site.
Pt was started on Zosyn/Vanco for this PEG infection, and in [**11-29**] days pt's purulent discharge and erythema resolved along with near resolution of pt's abdominal pain at the site.
While this issue was resolved, pt continues to have diffuse abdominal pain, at baseline [**2-5**].
The current thought is that the abdominal pain may be due to direct effect of GVH on his bowel.
Pt's TF were started at 5-10cc/hr and could not be advanced (goal 40cc/hr) due to very high residuals (>100cc whenever checked).
Pt's gastroparesis was so severe that tube feeds were stopped.
GI thought gastroparesis was due to the high level of narcotics (pt was getting for abdominal pain).
This was first tolerated without emesis on [**7-6**].
Pt is already showing very mild improvements in skin turgor and range of movement of extremities (from 4d of Gleevac).
Goal is to decrease narcotic requirement as much as possible to help with GI motility.
Also side note, Pt developed increased SOB on [**6-29**], with decreasing O2 sat to 90% (pt became very anxious since he knew this is what sent him to the ICU in the first place).
Pt's EKG had ST changes from previous, but cardiology consult said these were early repolarizations, and not worrisome of ACS and CE negative.
Pt's CXR/Chest CT did not show worsening of pneumonia, and actually showed mild improvement.
Pt was already anti-coagulated with Fondaparinox for a PE in [**2-3**] (attributed cause of his persistent tachycardia).
And pt already had a known history of cardiomyopathy with TTE on [**2170-4-17**] showing EF 45-50%, likely multifactorial- chemotherapy, radiation, GVHD, longstanding hypertension/tachycardia.
Patient became tachypneic and with agonal breaths.
Patient was found to have a small consolidate on CXR and was started on Vancomycin for s. aureus pneumonia.
He repeatedly retained CO2 to levels similar to intubation, despite [**Last Name (un) 10737**] in very low dose of fentanyl for pain control.
Patient was explained the risk and benefits of receiving lorazepan (half a dose than before) and wanted his anxiety treated though risks included potential respiratory failure and death.
Given his underlying condition, he wished primary goal to be comfort and did not want to be re-intubated or receive agressive care.
