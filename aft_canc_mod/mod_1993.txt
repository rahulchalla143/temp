He had not been able to get out of a chair or exert himself secondary to this shortness of breath.
He also described increasing lower extremity edema.
Four-to-five pillow orthopnea.
He has not had any recent fevers, chills, and cough, but he has been "gurgling" and sounding congested per his family.
He has had no nausea or vomiting.
He has had diarrhea, had three episodes of large volume loose stool since Sunday.
He was found to have a new pleural effusion, which was drained.
The preliminary results looked like an exudate with 26 atypical cells likely from a malignancy.
The patient feels that his breathing has improved since the tap.
He has had a 45 pound weight loss.
Esophageal cancer.
Normocytic anemia likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease.
Acute renal failure.
Calcium carbonate and ergocalciferol 50,000 units q week being held secondary to hypercalcemia.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
He had mild exophthalmus.
He had 9 cm of JVD, no lymphadenopathy.
He had a regular, rate, and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 100 beats per minute.
STUDIES IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM:  He had a CT of the head which showed no hemorrhage.
A chest x-ray showed increased interval bilaterally and pleural effusions right greater than left.
A urine culture from [**8-23**] showed Pseudomonas which was sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
The patient was admitted to Medicine for further workup of his shortness of breath.
A STAT echocardiogram was done which was negative for tamponade.
A chest x-ray was done which showed increasing right pleural effusion.
On the 5th, CT was done to rule out pulmonary embolus, which was negative.
On the 6th, his endotracheal tube cuff ruptured and Anesthesia was consulted, and they replaced the endotracheal tube and the patient remained on the ventilator until the time of his demise, at which time the endotracheal tube was pulled.
However, this was deferred due to his deteriorating clinical status.
Renal:  His creatinine was rising during his ICU stay possibly secondary to the sepsis, versus hypotension, versus the dye load from the CTA.
He was volume repleted and close monitoring was made of his renal status.
Cardiovascular:  Patient had multifocal atrial tachycardia and frequent ectopy during his unit stay.
A family meeting was held on the 7th to discuss the patient's deteriorating condition due to septic shock and his poor prognosis especially given the metastatic esophageal carcinoma.
At 7:45 p.m., on [**8-30**], there was no pulse, no spontaneous respirations, no corneal or pupillary reflexes.
