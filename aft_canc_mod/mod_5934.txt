F with L ilium plasmacytoma of the bone diagnosied in [**10-11**] and multiple myeloma in [**3-13**] when bone marrow showed 40-50% plasma cells, admitted on [**2194-3-12**] for nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping.
Noted to have new rebound tenderness in RUQ and hypoactive bowel sounds, and she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further evaluation.
During her ICU course, surgery was consulted and on examination, she had no acute abdomen and did not need any type of surgical evaluation.
Her CT Abd/Pelvis showed no bleed around the liver.
Her blood pressures remained elevated during her ICU course in 160-170's systolic, which was treated with IV lopressor.
She has had emesis x 2, greenish in color and little in volume.
Multiple myeloma - completed C1D8 of velcade/dex on [**2193-11-25**]  - In [**9-10**] she was referred to orthopedics and underwent an MRI which revealed a large mass in the left iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] that was destroying the cortical bone.
CT torso did not reveal any other lesions anywhere else.
More recently she developed a symptomatic lytic lesion on her left fibula and received radiation to that (2/[**Date range (3) 99311**]).
Her bone marrow aspirate and biopsy done on [**2193-4-3**] showed extensive involvement with plasma cells.
Cytogenetics revealed 46XX karyotype but FISH showed borderline abnormality for the D13S319 probe (6% monosomy 13).
Her left fibula needed XRT again in late [**8-11**] at a different spot due to a new painful lytic lesion.

Limited examination secondary to lack of intravenous or oral contrast administration.
No large intra-abdominal collections.
Possible antral gastric thickening which could be compatible with gastritis.
Numerous foci of air present within the bladder are likely related to introduction of Foley balloon.
Multiple lytic lesions consistent with patient's history of multiple myeloma, grossly stable in appearance compared to [**2194-1-16**].
New interval left femoral head fixation [**3-13**] CT Head  1.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
New extensive innumerable punctate lytic lesions throughout the calvarium and skull base.
Findings consistent with progression of multiple myeloma.
Expansile soft tissue lesion extending from the sphenoid bone into the sphenoid sinuses.
Findings are also consistent with progression of multiple myeloma.
For more detailed evaluation of this skull base expansile lesion gadolinium-enhanced MRI could provide better characterization.
CXR [**3-14**]  IMPRESSION: No pneumonia or acute cardiopulmonary process.
Compression wedge deformity with possible lucent lesions in mid thoracic vertebral bodies, consistent with known h/o multiple myeloma, similar to the CT scan from [**2194-2-4**].
Mild nonspecific thickening of the gastric folds and proximal duodenum.
This may represent infectious or inflammatory gastroenteritis.
No bowel obstruction or appendicitis.
Stable large right hepatic lobe lesion most likely representing a hemangioma.
Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.
Multiple lytic osseous lesions involving several vertebral bodies and the pelvis.
---------------- MRI HEAD (PRELIM READ) [**3-15**]  FINDINGS: As seen on the CT, there is an expansile lesion identified at the skull base involving the basisphenoid extending and protruding into the sphenoid sinus.
The mass is hypointense both on T1- and T2-weighted images with minimal marginal enhancement.
The findings are consistent with the diagnosis of a focal myeloma deposit.
Several foci of signal abnormality with enhancement are seen in the skull consistent with multiple myeloma.
Multiple periventricular and subcortical hyperintensities are seen due to small vessel disease.
There is no abnormal parenchymal, vascular or meningeal enhancement identified.
IMPRESSION: Skull base lesion consistent with myeloma which involves the basisphenoid and protrudes into the sphenoid sinus.
Multiple lytic lesions in the skull are suggestive of multiple myeloma.
No acute infarct seen.
No parenchymal enhancement identified.
FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: There were several bursts of focal mixed frequency slowing seen independently in the left and right temporal regions.
BACKGROUND: Included a well-formed 10 Hz alpha frequency in posterior areas bilaterally during wakefulness.
SLEEP: The patient appeared to remain awake or minimally drowsy throughout the record.
No stage II sleep was obtained.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG in the waking and drowsy states due to the bilateral and independent areas of focal mixed frequency slowing.
The tracing cannot specify the etiology, but vascular disease is a relatively common cause of such findings.
Nevertheless, there were no areas of fixed or more prominent focal slowing, and there were no epileptiform features.
F with L ilium plasmacytoma of the bone diagnosed in [**10-11**] and multiple myeloma in [**3-13**] when bone marrow showed 40-50% plasma cells, who was admitted for nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping, transferred briefly on night of admission to the MICU for altered mental status.
# Altered mental status  On the night of admission the patient received 0.5 mg IV ativan for nausea, and one hour later, she was noted to be somnolent, but reacting to voice and pain.
Noted to have new rebound tenderness in RUQ and hypoactive bowel sounds, and she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further evaluation.
However, other etiologies such as seizure, infection (given increased WBC and low grade fever) and myeloma (patient underwent MRI Head which showed sphenoid sinus lesion consistent with myeloma) were entertained.
Neurology was consulted, and found no focal neurological findings.
An EEG performed on [**3-16**] was abnormal but did not show epileptiform activity.
Though one blood culture was still pending at the time of this dictation, no cultures were positive and infection was thought a less likely etiology.
# Abdominal cramping, Nausea, Vomiting  The patient developed rebound tenderness in the setting of altered mental status.
CT abdomen showed no acute intrabdominal process, surgery evaluated and agreed.
Patient had a repeat scan 2 days later in the setting of low grade fever, leukocytosis and mild RLQ tenderness.
CT showed likely enteritis involving gastric and duodenal mucosa.
She was started on Zosyn empirically with c. diff pending.
Patient initially had loose stools at home but has had none since admission.
# Hypertension  SBPs were elevated to 190s.
CT and MRI showed no evidence of bleed or acute infarct.
# Multiple Myeloma MRI head with expansile lesion at skull base/sphenoid sinus consistent with myeloma.
Her primary oncologists plan to discuss the possibility of radiating the lesion with the radiation oncologists and this will be discussed at her follow up hem/onc appointment on [**2194-3-21**].

You had a brief decrease in consciousness while you were here which was likely due to some nausea medications you received.
You had an MRI of the head which showed a lesion consistent with myeloma, the radiation oncologists will evaluate whether you might benefit from radiating this lesion.
You were also evaluated by neurology who performed an EEG which showed no evidency of seizure activity.
Please return to the ER if you develop any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting or ANY worrisome symptoms.
