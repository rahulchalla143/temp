Admission Date:  [**2165-5-29**]     Discharge Date:  [**2165-6-1**]  Date of Birth:   [**2103-9-19**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post alcohol ablation of intraventricular septum.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 51-year-old gentleman with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome/chronic anemia who has a 3-year to 4-year history of exertional dyspnea with occasional left-sided chest pressure.
He saw his primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**2164-2-6**], at which time his workup included a stress test which was negative and an echocardiogram which had evidence of a left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
He was referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2031**] in [**2164-9-5**] and had a repeat echocardiogram there in [**2164-10-6**] with evidence of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular outflow tract gradient at 48 mmHg which increased to 88 with Valsalva.
At that time, he had an ejection fraction of 60% and evidence of asymmetric septal left ventricular hypertrophy.
without much improvement on his dyspnea on exertion or left-sided chest pressure.
with some improvement, but the patient stopped taking his medications approximately three weeks ago secondary to constipation.
Electrocardiogram on Norpace had evidence of a mildly prolonged Q-T interval and sinus bradycardia with first-degree atrioventricular heart block.
Given these persistent symptoms, and no relief with medical management, the patient was admitted on [**5-26**] for an elective ethanol septal ablation.
Post procedure electrocardiogram had evidence of a new right bundle-branch block.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   On review of systems, the patient denies any history of syncope, lightheadedness, orthopnea, lower extremity edema, weight gain, or chest pain.
He claims his symptoms of shortness of breath occur with one block ambulation of climbing up one flight of stairs, and they have been stable over the last three to four years.
Anemia/myelodysplastic syndrome.
Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:   He has multiple family members who died of sudden cardiac events.
In general, a pleasant, white, elderly male in no acute distress.
Cardiovascular revealed the patient had a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur heard throughout the precordium, loudest in the left lower sternal border, which radiated to both the axilla and the carotids; increased with Valsalva, decreased with inspiration.
Abdominal examination revealed bowel sounds were positive, soft and nontender.
No hepatosplenomegaly was appreciated.
Extremities revealed no edema.
Left and right groin sites were clean, dry, and intact with no hematoma.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram on admission showed a normal sinus rhythm at 68 with evidence of a new right bundle-branch block.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit status post ethanol ablation of intraventricular septum with a history of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.
The patient did develop a new right bundle-branch block after the procedure.
After 48 hours on telemetry, and no further changes in his electrocardiogram, the patient's pacer wire was removed.
Again, repeat electrocardiograms and telemetry showed no further evidence of heart block.
The patient had a repeat echocardiogram prior to discharge which showed evidence of symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with return of left ventricular outflow tract gradients to 90, ejection fraction of 75%, and the patient was discharged on 75 mg of Toprol-XL and aspirin and was to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2031**] for a repeat echocardiogram in two to three weeks.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome, with a baseline hematocrit in the 26 to 30 range.
The patient's initial hematocrit was 26.8 on arrival; however, during his stay, with multiple blood draws and his procedure, the patient's hematocrit trended down to 24.5, but stabilized there.
Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, status post ethanol septal ablation.
New right bundle-branch block.
