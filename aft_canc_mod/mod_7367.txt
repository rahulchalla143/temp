Admission Date:  [**2141-12-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2141-12-28**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Phenytoin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**] Chief Complaint: chest pain and SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac cath; no intervention  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] yo f w/ a h/o who noted the onset of SSCP last night.
Reports that she had the sudden onset of severe SSCP associated with SOB last night.
The pain began last night.
Past Medical History: osteoporosis benign CNS tumor, removed age 70, by report now recurrent diverticulosis hypertension R pubic ramus fracture and R humerus fx [**1-26**] fall sustained [**10-30**]    Social History: Lives with daughter.
No respiratory distress.
no le edema.
Follow up on MICU admission shows resolution of lateral changes, new Qws inferiorly and hyperacute Tws.
Severe mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
No evidence of aortic dissection, aneurysmal dilatation, or pulmonary embolism.
Bilateral pleural effusions with perihilar edema and interstitial edema are suggestive of underlying congestive heart failure.
Multiple thoracic wedge compression fractures of uncertain chronicity and probable nonacute right humeral surgical neck fracture.
Recommend correlation to clinical exam and if acute fracture is suspected, dedicated imaging to this region.
Diffuse coronary and vascular calcifications.
Noncalcified sub 5 mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
Given patient's age followup is probably not needed, however, if clinically indicated, a repeat scan in one year may be ordered to assess stability if patient has no known primary malignancy.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
[**12-15**] CXR: Probable CHF with pulmonary edema and/or associated multilobar pneumonia.
Incidental note of fracture of neck of right humerus.
Selective coronary angiography of this heavily calcified right dominant system revealed diffuse severe three vessel and mild-moderate left main disease.
The LAD had diffuse disease with a proximal-mid 80% lesion after a small-caliber D1 branch (which itself was subtotally occluded proximally prior to a bifrucation).
A long D2 had a proximal subtotal occlusion.
The mid LAD had an 80% lesion involving D3 followed by an aneurysm with diffuse disease in a long distal LAD.
The LCX had an ostial 40% lesion, a proximal 80% lesion, a modest AV groove vessel with mid 50% and distal 80% lesions before LPLs.
The major OM had an aneurysmal bifurcation lesion with 80% stenosis into the lower pole.
The RCA had a proximal 60-70% lesion and then was totally occluded after the conus and atrial branches with only faint filling of acute marginal branches via vasa collaterals; the mid-distal RCA filled only retrogradely via left-to-right collaterals.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mild pulmonary hyptertension with PA pressures 38/14 mmHg.
The mean PCW was slightly elevated at 12 mmHg.
Left femoral vascular access was utilized due to a right pelvic fracture.
The patient had a heavily calcified and tortuous left common iliac artery looping into the abdominal aorta (traversed using a Magic Torque wire and a [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 2493**]-Tip introducing sheath).
pelvic Xray: Evidence of remote trauma involving the right inferior pubic ramus.
No acute fracture seen.
wbc 4.2, hct 28.4, plt 164    Brief Hospital Course: A/P: [**Age over 90 **] yo f w/ inf STEMI and subsequent pulmonary edema, 4+MR, and hypotension.
Cardiac cathterization showed severe diffuse three vessel and mild-moderate left main coronary artery disease; these lesions were not ammenable to stenting or CABG.
She developed hypotension with both imdur and lisinopril (which were stopped).
B. pump: Ms [**Known lastname **] has left ventricular dysfunction and CHF with EF 25-30%.
She has had persistant pulmonary edema on exam (L>R) but this has improved over her course.
She was on aldactone for class III-VI heart failure but this was discontinued due to poor po intake and hypotension.
C. Rhythm: Ms [**Known lastname **] had no ectopy on telemetry .
2) hypotension- Ms [**Known lastname **] has been periodically hypotense inhouse likely [**1-26**] combination of volume depletion in the setting of severe mitral regurg.
4) pelvis fracture- Ms [**Known lastname **] has a pelivic XR showing remote trauma of R inf pelvic ramus.
She also has an old RUE humerus fx s/p sling.
5) renal insufficiency- Ms [**Known lastname **]' Cr has ranged between 0.7 and 1.1 largely secondary to very poor po intake and dehydration.- encourage PO intake .
Clonazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO TID (3 times a day): hold for sedation or RR<10.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] Of [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: interior STEMI CAD Class III-IV NYHA CHF hypotension hypertension left ventricular dysfunction and systolic CHF with EF 25-30% and MR 4+, TR 2+ pelvic fracture and right humoral from [**10-30**]   Discharge Condition: fair AFVSS   Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack.
You have been given new medications to help regulate your heart rate and function and try to prevent any chest pain.
Please notify your physician or go to the emergency room if you have fevers >100.4, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, swelling in your legs, vomiting or abdominal pain or any other symptoms which are concerning to you.
