Admission Date:  [**2113-8-20**]     Discharge Date:  [**2113-9-2**]    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76-year-old man with a history of compression fractures, chronic back pain and atrial fibrillation who presents this admission to the Neurology Service on [**2113-8-20**] with new Patient had reported a fall two days ago where legs gave way without warning and he did not injure himself.
His wife was there to support him and he had no alternation in consciousness, no vertigo, no lightheadedness, shortness of breath, acute weakness.
The patient himself denied Yesterday, he was able to use his walker as usual and apart from the back pain felt in his usual state of health.
No urinary frequency or urgency, incontinence, no bowel movements on the day of admission which patient reported was unusual.
Denies weakness in his arms, neck pain, numbness and tingling, no fever, night sweats, headache.
Patient and his wife denies any progression of  his weakness beyond the a.m.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, chronic back pain, recent CT of the chest with multiple nodules, inflammatory versus infection, most likely neoplasm, bipolar disorder, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, left hip replacement, left knee replacement, left femoral plate, shoulder surgery, hernia repair, peripheral vascular disease, organic mania, sleep disorder, basal cell cancer of the back.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father with acute leukemia.
The patient has severe cervical rigidity and kyphosis.
Speech fluent, spontaneous, no paraphasic errors.
There is no right-left confusion, neglect.
Release testing reveals left greater that right palmomental reflex, normal jaw jerk, no rooting, slight grasp bilaterally.
There is no relative afferent defect.
Extraocular movements are full, no nystagmus.
He was able to exert some proximal movements, but no distal.
Reflexes are brachial 3+ bilaterally and 1+ bilaterally otherwise with downgoing toes bilaterally and no clonus.
On sensory exam, light touch is decreased in the feet bilaterally.
It is difficult to determine whether or not there is a sensory level.
Pinprick and temperature is decreased in the feet symmetrically.
Mildly impaired position sense in the fingers bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram [**2107**]:  Atrial fibrillation, nonspecific ST changes.
He was admitted with severe paraparesis, status post fall without loss of consciousness or head trauma and worsening back pain.
CT of the thoracolumbar spine done on [**8-21**] showed T12, L1, L4-L5 compression fractures with retrolisthesis of L3 and L4 and L4 on L5 and a calcified mass on the tail of the pancreas.
CT of abdomen [**8-22**] with contrast showed a 4 x 8 x 5. cm mass in the tail of the pancreas and several tiny nodules in lung bases, left greater with right with patchy linear opacities in right base.
Bone scan on [**8-23**] showed increased foci in the lower lumbar spine and right iliac ring suspicious for metastatic disease.
A myelogram was ordered initially, but could not be done because the patient refused the myelogram on the first day and subsequently had abnormally high INR.
Bronchoscopy at that time showed significant aspirated material.
Differential diagnoses include: Secondary to his narcotic pain medications versus aspiration pneumonia.
It should be noted that the patient was unable to tolerate an MRI secondary to his scoliosis.
Transiently on dopamine for hypotension and transfused one unit of packed red blood cells.
Ultimately, patient did receive a CT myelogram which showed obstruction to flow of contrast from below at T8 and T9 level.
Also a sacral mass at the epidural extension.
Question of a T spine epidural mass and ultimately his Decadron was discontinued on [**8-29**], because of no improvement.
The patient was extubated on [**2113-8-29**] with a plan for a sacral mass biopsy.
Patient was transiently transferred to the Medical Service from [**8-29**] through [**8-31**] but had another respiratory arrest while on the floor with gradually worsening hypercapnia and acidosis.
He was found unresponsive, without respirations and reintubated and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Overall impression at this time on [**8-31**] was that patient likely had metastatic pancreatic disease, left pancreatic cancer.
He had a mildly elevated PSA but this was not thought to be related to his current process.
Ultimately, his biopsy of his sacral lesions was consistent with malignancy, likely adenocarcinoma.
Respiratory support was continued with suspected patient more than likely had a mucus plugging event.
His overall prognosis is extremely grave and the patient's dopamine was weaned.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Same as presenting medical history with addition of metastatic adenocarcinoma.
