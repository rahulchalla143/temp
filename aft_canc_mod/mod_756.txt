Given the patient's history, this is concerning for a metastatic tumor, though a primary brain tumor cannot be excluded.
MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST Study Date of [**2117-12-23**] 3:10 PM right frontal mass with extensive vasogenic edema and mass effect with leftward midline shift.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2117-12-24**] 1:04 AM Status post right frontal craniectomy with expected edema in the postoperative site and continued subfalcine herniation of approximately 8 mm.No unexpected postoperative hemorrhage.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2117-12-25**] 9:35 PM expected post-operative changes    Brief Hospital Course: 59 year old female with a history of metastatic breast CA presenting with complaints of HA and confusion, found to have a frontal mass with vasogeneic edema and mass effect on MRI.
# Brain mass: Initial neurosurgery assessment in the ED was that the patient's condition was not a surgical emergency but needed oncological staging work up first.
MRI revealed a solitary peripheral right frontal lobe mass with extensive vasogenic edema and mass effect.
# Breast Cancer: Per the patient's primary oncologist, the patient's capecitabine was held, as the acute surgical issues were being addressed.
On [**2117-12-23**] she underwent MRI wand study for intraop image guidance and was taken to the OR where under general anesthesia she underwent right frontal craniotomy with excision of mass.
She woke up slowly and head CT was done which showed good post op appearance with no hemorrhage but slight edema.

You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.
-An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.
Loss of vision, either partial or total.
Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.
Severe sensitivity to light.
Severe headache or change in headache.
Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
New onset of seizure or change in seizure, or seizure from which you wake up confused.
Due to the complexity of neurosurgical procedures and treatment of neurosurgical problems, effective advice regarding emergency situations cannot be given over the telephone.
Should you have a situation which is not life-threatening, but you feel needs addressing before normal office hours or on the weekend, please present to the local emergency room, where the physician there will evaluate you and contact us if needed.
