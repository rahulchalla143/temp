Patient had no history of pain, but had noticed loose stools previous to that point.
As the problem had not resolved over the following few weeks, the patient was sent for a colonoscope, which revealed a 6 cm circumferentiated mass in her colon.
Patient denies any fever or chills, weight loss, night sweats, headache, shortness of breath, cough, bloating, dysuria, hematuria, jaundice.
Patient only endorses positive nausea, but states that she feels well, and denies any current vomiting or abdominal pain.
History of cerebrovascular accident with right-sided weakness.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Degenerative joint disease.
Myofascial pain syndrome.
In general exam, she was alert and oriented times two, not to be place, nonambulatory in no distress.
There was no rash, no jaundice noted.
HEENT:  There was no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly appreciated.
Pulmonary:  Positive for right lower lobe crackles, otherwise were clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes were noted.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, no rubs or gallops, 1-2/6 systolic ejection murmur.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly appreciated.
Lower extremities revealed no erythema or edema.
In the preoperative days following the admission, the patient had a chest x-ray, which revealed marked improvement in congestive heart failure with linear opacities towards the lung bases.
The patient underwent stress testing on [**5-4**], which revealed an EKG with evidence of a prior myocardial infarction.
During the testing there was no ST segment changes over the baseline abnormalities.
The patient had no anginal symptoms and no ischemic EKG changes.
On the following day, [**5-5**], the patient underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram, which revealed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, an ejection fraction of approximately 45%.
There was mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation, moderate 2+ mitral regurgitation.
The colonoscopy revealed a high grade obstruction in the rectum that the scope was unable to pass through it.
To further evaluate the mass within the left rectum, the patient underwent a transrectal ultrasound, which revealed a rectal mass with an extension beyond the muscularis propria and therefore considered to be a T3 lesion.
There is also a single lymph node along the left lateral aspect of the rectum, which had a dimension of 2.8 mm.
Over the next couple of days, the patient continued to do well with no complaints and to complete her cardiac workup prior to surgery, the patient underwent a thallium stress test, which revealed a hypokinesis of the inferior wall that was moderate and reversible.
The results were as follows:  A circumferential enhancing mass noted in the rectum measuring up to 6 mm in thickness.
Multiple colonic diverticula, enumerable diverticula noted in the sigmoid colon, and resultant in sigmoid wall thickening.
There were no complications during the procedure, and the patient tolerated the procedure well.
The patient's epidural needs to be changed over to a Dilaudid/bupivacaine solution for an increase in pain control.
The patient tolerated this well and there were no difficulties.
By postoperative day #5, the patient had her epidural removed and pain was controlled only with IV Morphine as needed.
Patient had brief episodes of confusion, but these resolved with the presence of a sitter in the room, and constant contact with the nurses.
Colonic mucosal biopsies revealed no convincing features of malignancy are identified.
Highest node revealed fragment of fibrovascular and adipose tissue, no lymph nodal tissue identified.
Sigmoid revealed A) diverticulosis, B) no diagnostic abnormalities recognized at the resection of the margins, C) lymph nodes, no evidence of malignancy.
The adenocarcinoma was low grade invading through the muscularis propria into the subserosa.
Status post low anterior resection.
History of cerebrovascular accident.
Congestive heart failure.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Degenerative joint disease.
Myofascial pain syndrome.
