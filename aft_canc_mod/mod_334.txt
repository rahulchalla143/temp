Admission Date:  [**2126-11-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2126-11-15**]   Service:  ACOVE  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Nausea, vomiting and dizziness.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82 year-old female with a remote history of breast cancer, hypothyroidism, type 2 diabetes mellitus who presents with a three week history of vertigo and episode of weakness this a.m. of admission.
For three weeks the patient with daily episodes of feeling like the room was spinning around her only occurring with standing, relieved with sitting and lying supine associated with gait instability and need to support herself with walls.
The patient was prescribed Meclozine by her primary care physician for unclear duration with no benefit.
On the a.m. of admission the patient could not get up from her couch for six hours secondary to inability to lift head off the pillow.
The patient also reports significant nausea and vomiting over the past several days.
She had no acute complaints in the Emergency Department.
No vertigo, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
History of right breast cancer status post local excision and axillary node dissection in [**2118-6-29**], status post radiation therapy on Tamoxifen.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for constipation, positive for hearing loss, which is chronic, positive for taking good po, positive for bilateral knee pain, which is also chronic and positive for a 12 pound weight loss over the past year, which was not intentional.
No history of prior viral episode recently.
In general, the patient is awake, alert and oriented times three, hard of hearing and in no acute distress.
HEENT examination no nystagmus.
Midline incision status post thyroidectomy.
Decreased prominence of left nasal labial fold.
Chest x-ray flattening of hemidiaphragm, positive atelectasis, positive opacity in left lower lobe nodule.
No consolidations or effusions.
Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm at 96 beats per minute, first degree AV block, left axis deviation, which is new, right bundle branch block, which is old, no acute ST or T wave changes.
Head CT on [**10-31**] showed positive calcified density in right ethmoid sinus with unclear etiology.
IMPRESSION:  The patient is an 82 year-old year-old female with a history of breast cancer, hypertension, hyperlipidemia with three weeks of vertigo, ataxia and episode of weakness on the morning of admission.
Cardiovascular:  The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus and was admitted and placed on telemetry and monitored with serial CKs and troponin.
The patient actually did rule in for inferior myocardial infarction and was started on Plavix as the patient is unable to take aspirin and given her coagulopathy was not started on heparin, also with the possibility of there being some kind of mass lesion in her brain the patient was not given any heparin.
She underwent an echocardiogram the following day, which showed inferior hypokinesis consistent with an inferior myocardial infarction.
The Plavix was discontinued secondary to hematemesis with coffee ground emesis and the patient was not placed on any anticoagulation after this point or antiplatelet agents as she was at significant risk for further gastrointestinal bleeding.
Throughout these episodes the patient did not report any chest pain, shortness of breath and only continued to feel nauseous.
Imaging was done with MRI as well as MRI with contrast, which showed a mass consistent with hemorrhagic focus in her cerebellum on the right side.
Unclear initially if this was a tumor or a stroke.
Further imaging was done with MR [**Last Name (Titles) 9868**], which further delineated the mass and showed that it was more consistent with a tumor.
The patient declined biopsy or any invasive workup of this mass and it is still unclear whether it is a tumor or a hemorrhagic stroke, however, it is significantly more likely that it is a tumor.
The patient's symptoms of nausea and vomiting improved after which she was started on Decadron, which was changed from intravenous to po and continues to do well on the po dosing of Decadron.
It appears that the mass was causing compression of her fourth ventricle causing a mass shift and after starting Decadron her symptoms improved likely indicating that the Decadron had caused shrinking of the tumor and decrease of the edema.
After much discussion it was decided that if no further surgical workup was to be planned and no further chemotherapy would be planned the patient was to continue on Tamoxifen and would be offered radiation therapy with the understanding that this may not be a tumor, however, the benefits of palliating her symptoms would out weigh her chances of getting morbidity from the radiation itself.
A workup was done with a mixing study, which revealed lupus anticoagulant as the etiology of her coagulopathy and for this reason she will not be continued on any sort of anticoagulation.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient had a significant gastrointestinal bleed with hematemesis, coffee ground emesis on Plavix.
Nasogastric lavage with 1500 cc of normal saline in order to clear the coffee grounds.
The patient went to the Intensive Care Unit for a day to monitor her for further bleeding, however, her hematocrit and hemodynamics were stable and she was not transfused and not endoscoped as she had just suffered an myocardial infarction.
Bleeding did stop and the patient did not have any guaiac positive stools after this point.
Right cerebellar mass.
Inferior myocardial infarction.
Lupus anticoagulant coagulopathy.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
Breast cancer history, possible metastatic disease to cerebellum.
The patient is tolerating po with no longer having symptoms of nausea, vomiting or dizziness and is to be discharged to a short term rehab facility.
