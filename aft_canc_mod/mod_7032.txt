[**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]  DIAGNOSIS: Right pleural effusion:    NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Reactive mesothelial cells and blood, see note.
Interval resolution of right-sided pleural effusion with placement of new right chest tube.
No pneumothorax.
Newly apparent increased diffuse interstitial markings on the right, concerning for lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
Increased left lower lung consolidation may represent combination of small left pleural effusion and atelectasis, though cannot exclude infectious process.
Bilaterally, the extent of pleural effusion has increased and, as a consequence, the lung parenchyma at the lung bases is denser than before.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
A small lucency at the level of the aortic arch is no longer visible.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2178-3-29**] 5:21 AM FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimally improved ventilation at both lung bases.
Unchanged cardiomegaly, unchanged extensive parenchymal opacities, right more than left, unchanged position of the right chest tubes.
The presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
No pneumothorax.
Residual effusion is small and subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall and neck has almost entirely resolved.
Moderate pulmonary edema, has worsened since [**3-27**], and in addition to the large right hilar or juxtahilar mass, there is suggestion of new consolidation in both the right suprahilar lung and at the left lung base medially.
How much of that is asymmetric edema, atelectasis or even fissural pleural fluid is impossible to say, but raises a real concern for pneumonia.
Mild cardiomegaly stable.
No pneumothorax.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2178-3-30**] at 9:59:30 AM      FINAL  IMPRESSION: Small to moderate pericardial effusion without overt tamponade physiology.
Abnormal septal motion suggesting increased inter-ventricular dependence.
Moderate pericardial effusion with evidence of impaired ventricular filling.
These findings may represent early tamponade physiology.
Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2178-4-2**] at 11:21:12 AM FINAL IMPRESSION: Small to moderate pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade.
Cardiomegaly, widened mediastinum, right perihilar mass-like consolidations, and left lower lobe opacity are unchanged.
The patient has known mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy and multiple lung nodules, all are better seen in prior CT of [**3-6**].
Left perihilar opacities are improved.
This could be due to improving atelectasis and layering pleural effusion.
Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
There is a persistent small left pleural effusion and no right pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 108423**] is a 74 year old man with multiple medical problems including newly diagnosed NSCLC with final pathology pending who presents to the ER with worsening dyspnea.
He was found to have recurrent pleural effusion, underwent repeat thoracentesis, R talc pleurodesis with chest tube/pleurex catheter placement.
Hospital course complicated by worsening dyspnea post-procedure and intermittent runs of SVT.
# Dyspnea: Likely due to re accumulation of pleural fluids.
Repeat CXR at that time showed re accumulation of pleural fluid, possibly due to clogged chest tube/pleurex, as his output had been decreasing.
Given concern for post-obstructive pneumonia/pneumonitis, especially with increasing WBC, he was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn for HCAP coverage.
This was stopped once he returned to the floor and he did not develop worsening SOB or become febrile after discontinuation.
#Pericardial [**Name (NI) 37749**] Pt was found to have a pericardial effusion on echocardiogram.
He did not have any evidence of volume overload on physical exam and also did not have an elevated pulsus.
# Sinus Tachycardia: On transfer to ICU, patient with sinus tachycardia to 100-120 range.
Patient has known history of pulmonary emboli on anticoagulation with LMWH and no evidence of prior coronary disease or cardiac history.
Per [**Date Range 2287**] outpatient records, notable history of chronic tachycardia to the low 110-113 since 2/[**2178**].
Recent 2D-Echo showing mild concentric LVH with no systolic dysfunction (LVEF 65%).
We controlled his pain with PO Dilaudid.
# NSCLC: Mr. [**Known lastname 108423**] is a pt of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who preferred to hold off starting chemotherapy during this admission.
We controlled his pain with PO Dilaudid.
Pt has follow up appointments with oncology, cardiology and interventional pulmonology   Medications on Admission: zolpidem 10 mg PO qHS PRN insomnia multivitamin 1 tab PO daily niacin 500 mg 1 tab PO daily propranolol 40 mg Tab PO PRN enoxaparin 100 mg SC BID ciprofloxacin 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q12H  for 14 days [**Hospital1 108422**] AC 10-100 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Five (5) mL PO q4H PRN cough   Discharge Medications: 1. zolpidem 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
