ABDOMEN: The liver enhances homogeneously without evidence for masses.
There is no biliary ductal dilatation.
Note is made of cholelithiasis, but no cholecystitis.
The kidneys enhance homogeneously without evidence for hydronephrosis.
There is a 1-cm left adrenal mass which is unchanged from prior study and statistically represents an adenoma.
Within the sigmoid colon is an approximately 5-cm area of thickening concerning for malignancy and corresponding to lesion seen on colonoscopy.
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy present.
No free fluid is seen.
Again noted is a small right side fat-containing inguinal hernia.

Approximately 5-cm sigmoid mass concerning for malignancy.
There is no evidence for metastatic disease and no lymphadenopathy.
Status post TIPS which is widely patent.
Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
TTE [**2201-12-24**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).

There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and cavity size with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta, descending thoracic aorta, and abdominal aorta.
Critical aortic stenosis by transvalvular velocity and gradients, but visually the aortic valve appears to be more pliable, and likely consistent with moderate to severe aortic stenosis.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2200-3-11**], the severity of aortic stenosis has increased by transvalvular velocity and gradients from moderate to critical; however, visually the valve appears to be similarly pliable.
[**2201-12-26**] KUB: There is residual contrast in the colon with increase in fecal material in the ascending and descending colon.
There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.
Moderate degenerative changes are in the lumbar spine.

Aside from atelectasis in the left lower lobe, the lungs are grossly clear.
Emphysema and scarring in the right upper lobe are better seen in prior CT from [**12-23**].
[**2202-1-4**] KUB: IMPRESSION: 1) Findings are consistent with a postoperative small bowel ileus.
If concern for mechanical small bowel obstruction persists, a CT would provide better characterization.
2) Intraperitoneal free air compatible with recent surgery.
No pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax.
Mildly dilated fluid-filled loops of ascending and descending colon suggestive of focal ileus.
Minimally prominent loops of small bowel measuring up to 2.5 cm, however, no signs of clear obstruction.

No evidence of extraluminal leak or stenosis.
No organized fluid collection in the abdomen or pelvis to suggest abscess.
Stable bulky appearance of the bilateral adrenal glands, left greater than right.
Air seen throughout the non-dilated colon, extending to the rectum, could reflect mild colonic ileus.

Active issues:  # Colon adenocarcinoma: Pt presented due to BRBPR and anemia on outpatient labs.
It was decided to proceed with inpatient colonoscopy since he continued to have BRBPR and there was concern about monitoring his fluid status during prep for colonoscopy given his comorbidities (particularly severe AS).
Unfortunately colonoscopy on [**12-23**] showed a sigmoid mass, and pathology confirmed adenocarcinoma.
Due to his severe aortic stenosis, he was also evaluated by the cardiology service, who felt that he could proceed with surgery with intraoperative TEE monitoring and did not require valve replacement prior to surgery.
# Acute on chronic anemia: Pt presented with Hct 22, baseline Hct ~28.
He was evaluated by cardiology service pre-operatively, who felt he could proceed with surgery with intraoperative cardiac monitoring.
His creatinine returned to his baseline of 1.1 without intervention.
Hyperkalemia: Potassium was elevated on admission to 6.0 with EKG changes concerning for peaked T waves.
Thought likely [**12-31**] high potassium content diet (pt frequently eats bananas, baked potatoes at home) and/or acute on chronic renal failure.
S. anginosus Bacteremia: During previous hospitalization, pt had blood cx [**11-17**] and [**11-28**] that grew Strep anginosus in setting of GI bleed.
He was initially treated with clindamycin but then switched to IV ceftriaxone after speciation became available.
He was continued on his home IV ceftriaxone on admission, and he remained afebrile with nl WBC.
He completed his course of ceftriaxone on [**12-26**] (was treated for 4 weeks to empirically treat endocarditis although no vegetation was seen on TTE during previous admission).
Idiopathic Cirrhosis s/p TIPS: On admission pt's LFTs, T bili, and INR were normal.
He has h/o esophageal varices on no varices were visualized on EGD of [**2201-11-25**] during previous hospitalization.
Pt was evaluated by anaesthesia and taken to the operating room for open sigmoid colectomy w/primary anastomosis.
Patient recovered well without incident and was transferred to floor on POD 1 after removal of Swanz and Arterial line.
He was again put on PO pain meds on POD 8 after diet was advanced and pain was well controlled.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
Patient continued to have problems with nausea and distension and his diet was backed down to NPO and then re-advanced after having several small BM's though no flatus.
On POD 5 he vomited 300cc, put back to sips, KUB showed air fluid levels,and an NGT was placed putting out 500cc of bilious fluid.
On POD 6 a CT scan that day failed to show leak or ascites and confirmed an ileus.
On POD 7 HIV meds were crushed and placed down NGT without issue and clamping trials were started after he began to pass flatus and had low residuals.
On POD 8 NGT was d/c and he has advanced to sips without issue and a KUB was obtained after he stopped passing flatus and it showed colonic air - pt was given a suppository and began passing large amounts of flatus and had a BM which continued into POD 9 at which time he was advanced to a regular diet which was well tolerated.
No post-operative transfusions were required and hematocrit was 30 at discharge and stable without signs of GI bleed.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.

You had a colonoscopy, which unfortunately showed a cancer in your colon.
You were admitted to the hospital after an open Sigmoid Colectomy with Primary Anastamosis for surgical management of the mass obstructing your colon which was revealed to be colonic adenocarcinoma.
As mentioned during you visit the results were that it was cancerous and you will need to continue to follow up with the Oncologists at [**Hospital1 18**].
You have tolerated a regular diet, passing gas and your pain is controlled with pain medications by mouth.
We made no changes to your medications while you were in the hospital but we did add medications for pain and a stool softener.
Some loose stool and passing of small amounts of dark, old appearing blood are explected however, if you notice that you are passing bright red blood with bowel movments or having loose stool without improvement please call the office or go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe.
Please take an over the counter stool softener such as Colace, and if the symptoms does not improve call the office.
If you have any of the following symptoms please call the office for advice or go to the emergency room if severe: increasing abdominal distension, increasing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, inability to tolerate food or liquids, prolonges loose stool, or constipation.
You have a long vertical incision on your abdomen that was closed with staples.
This incision can be left open to air or covered with a dry sterile gauze dressing if the incision become irritated from clothing.
Please monitor the incision for signs and symptoms of infection including: increasing redness at the incision, opening of the incision, increased pain at the incision line, draining of white/green/yellow/foul smelling drainage, or if you develop a fever.
Please call the office if you develop these symptoms or go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe.
You will be prescribed a small amount of the pain medication.
Do not drink alcohol while taking narcotic pain medication or Tylenol.
