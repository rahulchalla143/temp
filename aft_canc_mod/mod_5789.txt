T9 CT guided biopsy   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 96829**] is a 55 yo M w/long history of autonomic dysfunction complicated by urinary retention and suprapubic catheter placement who has multiple hospitalizations for recurrent UTI, most recently 2/[**2133**].
Pt also noted crusting material surrounding the catheter.
He does note intermittent chest pain x 1 wk.
It is not exertional, positional or pleuritic.
He does c/o productive cough over past few weeks, related to an episode 1 wk prior where he "stopped breathing, felt like I was choking."
In the ED, a WBC was 8.5, lactate 1.2, temp was 99.4   Past Medical History: - autonomic dysfunction c/b urinary retention requiring indwelling Foley catheter, with recurrent UTIs - CAD: s/p MI [**2107**], tx with angioplasty - diffuse interstitial pneumonitis - anemia - autoimmune hepatitis - autoimmune thyroiditis - autoimmune peripheral neuropathy - intradural t10 mass - s/p cholecystectomy - chronic pain - depression  Social History: Pt lived with wife and 30-year-old daughter prior to prolonged hospital/[**Hospital1 1501**] stay; disabled, but formerly a truck driver; uses wheelchair at home w/ bedside commode [**1-8**] autonomic dysfunction; Previosly smoked 1ppd x 20years, then quit for ~10 yr, restarted and now quit since [**10-12**]; no alcohol or IVDU.
Family History: father had MI at 72; Sister had [**Location (un) 96830**] after vaccine  Physical Exam: GEN: A&Ox3 HEENT: NCAT, PERRL, EOMI, OP clear, no LAD CV: RRR PULM: CTAB ABD: Soft, diffusely ttp w/o rebound or guarding.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please eval for infiltrate HISTORY: 55-year-old male with productive cough, questionable history of aspiration event.
AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Since most recent film there appears to be interval appearance to multiple ill-defined pulmonary nodules projecting over the right and left lower hemithoraces with the largest ill-defined opacity within the left mid hemithoraces measuring approximately 3.6 x 3.9 cm.
Changes from previously noted interstitial lung disease appear slightly improved on current radiograph.
Multiple calcified granulomas and calcified pleural plaques are better appreciated on prior CT examination.
No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:  Multiple new ill-defined pulmonary nodules with most dominant nodule projecting over the mid thorax.
Appearance of these nodules is suspicious for neoplastic or metastatic involvement with focal infectious or fungal etiologies felt to be less likely.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2134-2-17**] 10:53 AM  CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  Reason: please eval for masses  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 55 year old man with nodules seen on CXR, concerning for mets REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please eval for masses CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
CareWeb notes reveal the patient has a history of autoimmune hepatitis, thyroiditis, peripheral neuropathy, and autonomic dysfunction.
NON-CONTRAST CT OF THE CHEST: A new 1.6-cm nodule with somewhat irregular borders is seen in the right upper lobe.
Also, a 4.1-cm rounded solid appearing mass (soft tissue density), also with irregular contours is seen in the left lower lobe.
There are no air bronchograms in this lesion.
No other concerning nodules or masses are seen.
There has been progression of the patient's interstitial lung disease with interlobular septal thickening and traction bronchiectasis, predominantly at the lung bases.
Multiple tiny calcified granulomas are again noted reflecting prior granulomatous disease.
Left PICC terminates in the left brachiocephalic vein.
This exam is not optimized for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
The hypoattenuating lesion in the left lobe of the liver as well as bilateral renal cysts are unchanged.
Bone windows reveal a 7-mm sclerotic lesion in the medial clavicle, unchanged from [**2131**], and likely a bone island.
No other suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
4.4-cm solid left lower lobe mass and 1.5-cm right upper lobe nodule are new compared to CT from [**2132-9-6**].
The differential diagnosis for these lesions is very broad and includes infections (fungal infection or Nocardia), inflammatory conditions (cryptogenic organizing pneumonia), vasculitis (particularly as this patient has a history of autoimmune disorders), and neoplasm (synchronous primary carcinoma, metastasis, or pulmonary lymphoma).
Mild progression of fibrotic component of chronic interstitial lung disease.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
No masses or vegetations on aortic valve.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
No mass or vegetation on mitral valve.
No mass or vegetation on tricuspid valve.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
No vegetation/mass on pulmonic valve.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 55 year old man with nodules seen on CXR, concerning for mets, mass evolving over weekend, ?
Also, new O2 requirement over weekend, pulmonology concerned re: PE.
New O2 requirement over weekend.
Evaluate for pulmonary embolus.
CT OF THE CHEST: The previously identified nodule within the right upper lobe and mass within the left lower lobe is unchanged compared to recent CT from [**2134-2-17**].
There are again interstitial abnormalities as evidenced by interlobular septal thickening and traction bronchiectasis, predominantly at the lung bases, the extent of which is not changed from [**2-17**], [**2133**].
Multiple tiny calcified granulomas are again noted reflecting prior granulomatous disease.
Coronary calcifications are noted within the LAD.
There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.
There is mild pleural thickening with calcified pleural plaques.
No pulmonary embolus or thoracic aortic dissection is appreciated.
Small mediastinal lymph nodes are seen which do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Osseous structures demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Compared to the prior CT from five days ago, there is no significant change in chronic interstitial lung disease or pulmonary mass/nodule.
Subtle hypoenhancing lesion in the right lobe of the liver, better seen on preious CT from [**2134-2-17**] and recommend ultrasound for better characterization.
FNA, lung, left lower lobe mass, cell block:  H&E stain shows alveolar spaces lined by atypical mucinous epithelium with intra-alveolar and background mucin, suspicious for a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, bronchioloalveolar type.
RUL biopsy: Suspicious for well-differentiated adenocarcinoma   with features suggestive of bronchioalveolar type.
T9 bx:    Poorly-differentiated metastatic carcinoma  Brief Hospital Course: Unfortunately the patient did not survive this hospitalization.
Despite the teams best efforts the patient suffered irrepairable anoxic brain injury as revealed by an extremely limited physical exam and the findings on EEG.
