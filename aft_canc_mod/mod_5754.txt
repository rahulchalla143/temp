Recent admit in CCU, had [**First Name3 (LF) 99607**], was tapped, transudative with no malignant cells.
Plan for re-ECHO [**4-11**] and if large accumulation, needs window.

No definite pulmonary embolus is identified.
The right atrium and ventricle in particular are very large, and there is evidence of tricuspid regurgitation.
There is reflux of contrast into the IVC and hepatic veins, consistent with right heart failure.
There is a large pericardial effusion present.
There are aortic calcifications and coronary artery calcifications.
No pulmonary mass is identified.
There are patchy areas of atelectasis within the lungs, greater at the bases.
There is a small right-sided pleural effusion.
There is a prevascular lymph node adjacent to the aortic arch, which measures 6 mm in short axis dimension.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The inferior vena cava is enlarged, consistent with the patient's right heart failure.
The liver demonstrates a somewhat lobulated contour, which may be related to the patient's heart failure and hepatic congestion, though other forms of liver disease cannot be excluded and should be evaluated.
There is no free air within the abdomen.
There is a small amount of ascites fluid.
No pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph nodes are identified.
The abdominal aorta is of normal caliber, and the proximal celiac, SMA, bilateral renal arteries, and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] are patent.

IMPRESSION: 1)  No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
2)  Large pericardial effusion with evidence of right heart failure.
3)  Coronary artery calcification and calcification of the aorta.
Those findings may represent portal hypertension.
While these findings could be related to hepatic congestion related to the patient's heart failure, other forms of liver disease cannot be excluded and should be evaluated.
5)  Soft tissue hyperdense rounded lesions within the anterior abdominal wall.
There is ascites fluid present, which is mild to moderate in amount.

Gross: The specimen is received in formalin labeled "[**Known lastname 99606**], [**Known firstname **] - proximal ascending colon polyp" and consists of a 0.3 cm fragment of tissue; submitted into cassette coded A.  Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2114-4-12**] Conclusions: The right atrium is markedly dilated.

There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.

There is a small pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2114-4-14**], the pericardial effusion has increased.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Altered Mental Status: The patient was admitted for altered mental status.
2) Pericardial Effusion: The patient was found to have a reaccumulated pericardial effusion as compared with echocardiogram 1 week previously.
Also, she reported dyspnea during the hospital course.
The differential diagnosis includes maligancy, infection, rheumatologic condition.
This procedure was felt to be less risky in her as compared with pericardial window under general anesthesia.
Post procedure echos showed a minimal effusion, and she should continue to have serial echocardiograms weekly or every other week as an outpatient until follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who performed the procedure.
To workup the potential etiology of the effusion, she had a CT torso with contrast to evaluate for malignancy which showed large pericardial effusion but no malignancy.
The echocardiographic findings of 4+TR with tricuspid valve abnormality were felt to be suggestive of carcinoid syndrome, but 5HIAA level had been normal from previous admission.
She had a reported history of ?arthritis, and RF was high normal but the patient had no other signs or symptoms of clinical arthritis.
Sjogren's antibodies were sent prior to discharge given patient's report of dry eyes and question of enlarged parotids on exam.
3) Iron deficiency anemia: EGD/[**Last Name (STitle) 2792**] shows gastritis/gastropathy, duodenal AVM, internal bleeding hemmorhhoids.
This was thought to be due to bleeding into the pericardial space, as she had no rectal bleeding or evidence of hemolysis.
4) Gastritis/portal gastropathy - She was changed to a PPI from an H2 blocker for these findings.
5) Right heart failure: The patient has a very large RA/RV by echocardiogram, likely from her tricuspid valve regurgitation.
It was difficult to evaluate IO's without placement of foley as she was incontinent, but she felt the need to urinate when foley in place and became agitated, requiring a sitter.
6) Atrial fibrillation - She is not on anticoagulation given her iron deficiency anemia with multiple potential GI sources, risk of bleeding into her pericardium, and fall risk.
7) Quesions of paraesophageal hernia by EGD - This was a concerning finding on EGD, but as demonstrated by upper GI series, was just normal stomach below the diaphragm.
8) Peripheral eosinophilia - She had peripheral eosinophilia and itching which was most likely due to a drug hypersensitivity.
The cause was unclear, possibly due to total body volume overload, with R-sided CHF.
10) h/o glaucoma - She was continued on eye drops.
11) h/o hypothyroidism - She was continued on synthroid.
12) Skin - she was noted to have superficial excoriations on her sacral area and on her back.
