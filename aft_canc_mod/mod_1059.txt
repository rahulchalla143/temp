Patient recently discharged from OMED on [**2191-10-20**] with diagnosis of coag negative staph bacteremia/?endocarditis for which he was being treated with 6 weeks of IV vanc.
Creatinine upon discharge was 2.2 up from 1.8 - etiology of increase not well understood but postulated secondary to previous nephrotoxin.
Since d/c, patient reports decreased urine production but denies dysuria, hematuria.
Increased DOE and productive cough of yellow sputum though denies SOB at rest, pleuritic chest pain, or worsening LE edema.
No abd pain/N/V/D/blood in stool changes in bowel habits.
Yesterday, [**Hospital1 **] labs notable for worsening renal function and vitals signs with new hypotension with SBPs in to 80s so decision was made to transfer to the ED for further eval and potential initiation of CVVH/HD.
CXR with bilateral pleural effusions, stable extensive opacification of right lung with rll collapse, hazy opacity in LLL, ?
Foley placed with only 5cc of fluid drained.
Patient received levofloxacin for possible PNA, CTX for UTI and admitted to medicine for further eval of [**Last Name (un) **].
VS prior to transfer 98.5 82 96/61 20 95% 4L  Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - [**4-/2189**]: presented to an outside hospital with severe back pain, with CXR showing right upper lobe lung mass.
PET scan revealed FDG avidity at the periphery of the mass, with an FDG-avid paratracheal lymph node - [**2189-7-31**] cervical mediastinoscopy, multiple lymph nodes neg for malignancy (report not available).
Pt declined RUL lobectomy - [**2189-11-3**] new moderate right-sided pleural effusion; right lung nodule increased from 6.6 to 7.7 cm and was again noted to have broad contact with the chest wall - [**2189-12-2**]: Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] again saw the patient and recommended a right thoracotomy and RUL lobectomy.
Surgery was scheduled but was canceled by the patient - [**2190-1-1**] chest CT revealed further increase in the known necrotic RUL lung mass, now measuring 8.1 x 7.5 cm.
It was in direct contact with the peripheral pleural surface, with loss of a normal intercostal fat plane between the adjacent ribs, suggesting possible chest wall invasion.
The epicenter of the mass was in the right upper lobe but crossed the fissure to extend into the adjacent right middle lobe.
Prevascular and right paratracheal and precarinal lymph nodes were again demonstrated, with a slight interval increase in the size of the enlarged precarinal node.
However, due to his poor pulmonary function, with a DLCO of 60%, it was felt that he would not tolerate a pneumonectomy.
- [**2190-2-4**]: A repeat bronchoscopy and endobronchial ultrasound was performed for diagnostic purposes, with a biopsy of the right upper lobe mass revealing poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with immunostains positive for P63 and CK7 (weak), negative for TTF-1.
Squamous cell carcinoma was favored.
A transbronchial needle aspiration of station 7, 4R, and R11 lymph nodes revealed no malignant cells.
Two sets of washings were negative, but brushings were positive for malignant cells.
- [**2190-2-18**]: A repeat PET scan demonstrated no evidence of bony metastatic disease.
Thus, the patient was felt to have likely Stage IIIA (T3N1M0) squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.
Required prednisone taper due to severe radiation pneumonitis.
[**2190-12-7**] CT torso showing a mildly enlarged cavitating lesion in the right upper lobe, which is now 6.5 x 4.4 cm, increased from 6.3 x 3.7 cm.
[**Month (only) **]-[**2191-1-25**]: Treated with carboplatin, gemcitabine, with doses intermittently held for LFT abnormalities.
[**2191-2-25**]: CT chest without contrast showing slightly enlarged right upper lung mass, measuring 7.5 x 5.2 cm, with slightly enlarged soft tissue component at the right middle lobe bronchus, measuring 3 x 3 cm [**2191-2-22**]: Palliative chemo with taxotere, with doses held due to dehydration and cytopenias.
[**2191-4-3**]: Admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] because of uncontrolled nausea and emesis, dehydration, volume depletion.
Patient [**Hospital1 34676**] on [**2191-4-4**]  [**2191-4-12**]: discontinue taxotere due to intolerable nausea, emesis, decreased appetite .
[**2191-7-14**] CT chest: decreased size in primary mass, measuring 6.5 x 4.1 cm, as compared to 7.4 x 5.2 cm previously.
The previously noted thickening of the medial wall has also decreased, measuring 2.1 x 1.9 cm compared to 2.9 x 1.6 cm previously.
No new nodules are present.
Severe traction bronchiectasis related to post-radiation therapy changes has mildly improved.
Severe paraseptal emphysema is unchanged.
Treated initially with ampicillin and gentamicin, with gentamicin discontinued due to impaired renal function.
He had a right internal jugular  and axillary vein thrombosis, associated with his right sided port-a-cath, which was initially diagnosed at [**Hospital3 34678**] on [**2191-7-29**], and has continued on Lovenox for treatment.
[**2191-8-2**] CT angio of the chest showed a 4.5 cm x 3 cm thick-walled mixed solid and cystic structure in the right upper lobe corresponding to interval necrosis of treated tumor.
There is no pulmonary embolism.
Severe paraseptal emphysema was seen, along with post-radiation changes in the right lung.
There is an enlarged and irregular substernal thyroid goiter, with features concerning for malignancy.
[**2191-8-5**] MRI of the L-spine showed resolution of previously noted diskitis and osteomyelitis at T12 and L1.
There were multilevel degenerative changes throughout the lumbar spine, stable, causing moderate-to-severe canal stenosis.
[**2191-8-15**] MRI of the brain showed no intraparenchymal findings, but there was a new clivus mass, most likely representing an osseous  metastasis.
-History of gunshot wound for which a large abdominal surgery was required -Hypertension, stable.
-Emphysema/COPD -right internal jugular and axillary vein thrombosis, associated with his right sided port-a-cath   Social History: [**12-27**] ppd x 30 years currently still smoking, social alcohol use, history IV heroin use and cocaine use.

Compared to the prior examination, a cavitary necrotic right upper lobe mass is now nearly fluid-filled (2:22).
There is near-complete consolidation of the right upper lobe and right middle lobe.
Partial consolidation of the right lower lobe is present with peribronchial wall thickening.
There is copious debris within the right main stem bronchus (4:84).
A new right-sided small pleural effusion is present.
A new small-to-moderate sized left pleural effusion is present with compressive atelectasis; however, other areas of consolidation at the left base (4:129) appear separate from the pleural effusion and atelectasis and are worrisome for pneumonia.
Severe left upper lobe emphysema with a blebs is little changed.
No pneumothorax appears present.
Although less well evaluated without IV contrast, extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy with aortopulmonary window lymph nodes measuring 10 mm and right pretracheal lymph nodes measuring 10 mm appear little changed.

Dense coronary artery calcifications are present.
The left lobe of the thyroid remains markedly enlarged and heterogeneous in appearance with a focus of calcification.
Although not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, the upper abdomen contains a small amount of ascitic fluid which is new.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious bone lesions are present.
Progressive consolidation of a right upper, right middle and right lower lobes and the left lower lobe.
Findings may be due to post-obstructive pneumonia as there are extensive secretions within the right main stem bronchus.
