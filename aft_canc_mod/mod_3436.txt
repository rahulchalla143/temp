EMS arrived on scene and the patient was complaining of hip pain radiating to his low back.
The patient was taken to [**Hospital 5279**] [**Hospital 1108**] transferred to WX VA who then transferred him to [**Hospital1 **] for management of left acetabular fracture and right patellar fracture.
Had ORIF of L acetabular fracture on [**11-30**].
During he had narrow complex tachycardia (afib vs AVNRT) with HRs up to the 180s.
He had a CTA to evaluate for PE which was negative.
However, CT showed 2 focal areas of irregularity in the aorta thought to be ulceration vs. dissection.
He was transferred to the SICU on [**12-2**] due to rapid HR and possible dissection.
He had repeat CTA in the AM of [**12-2**] which showed no dissection.
HRs went up to the 190s and pt had narrow complex tachycardia.
He was seen by EP who thought he had an AVNRT as well as atrial fibrillation.
Currently patient is without complaints.

Cystic lesion seen on pelvic CT corresponds to a 4.3 cm exophytic simple renal cyst from the left lower pole.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2147-12-3**] 1:13 AM  FINDINGS: There continues to be moderate cardiomegaly.
There is a new area of opacity in the right lower lobe that could represent an early infiltrate or some volume loss.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Bilateral severe centrilobular emphysema.
Multinodular thyroid, with adjacent clips suggesting prior surgery.
Small hiatal hernia.
CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2147-12-2**] 5:15 AM Contour irregularities in the thoracic aorta and right common iliac artery likely represent chronic changes associated with atherosclerosis.
No evidence of acute dissection or contrast extravasation.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2147-11-28**] 10:34 PM IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute fracture.
Multilevel degenerative changes as detailed above.
Comminuted left acetabular fracture involving the posterior column and acetabular roof.
Two lytic lesions, involving the right iliac bone and the left pubic symphysis.
The larger lesion in the right iliac bone demonstrates cortical destruction and a small associated soft tissue mass.
Given the multiplicity of lesions, metastatic disease is the most likely differential consideration.
Low density structure in the left abdomen that is incompletely evaluated, possibly representing an exophytic cyst arising from the lower pole of the left kidney.
This could be further evaluated with renal ultrasound or CT.  CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2147-12-7**] 11:18 AM 1.
Small right common iliac artery aneurysm with thrombus component.
Descending thoracic aorta penetrating ulcer with small associated hematoma unchanged.
At the aortic arch at the apex medially, there is a small focal outpouching from which originates a small paraspinal artery.
No aortic dissection or aortic aneurysm identified.
Small bilateral effusions, right greater than left.
Indeterminate left upper pole renal lesion for which a dedicated non- contrast CT of the abdomen could be performed, alternatively, a dedicated MR could be performed.
Abnormal enlarged right hilar lymph node.
He was found to have a Left acetabular fracture and a right patella fracture.
In the recovery room he remained hemodynamically stable with his pain controlled.
On the floor he remained stable with his pain controlled.
On [**2147-12-1**] he began to experience several episodes of SVT associated with hypotension.
The patient was r/o for PE with CTA and transfered to the unit where he continued to have runs of SVT.
EP saw the patient and made recommendations for beta blocker increase as well as hydration - plus possible cardiac ablation.
Atrial fibrillation: Patient has a known history of atrial fibrillation.
- His RVR was thought to be precipitated by dehydration and catecholamines in setting of fracture and pain.
Ruled out for PE by CTA.
-EP evaluated the patient in-house and felt there was no acute indication for cardioversion.
- TFTs were not consistent with hyperthyroidism.
Therefore, he was started on sotalol 80 mg PO BID on [**2147-12-5**] and subsequently converted from atrial fibrillation to 1st degree AV block.
*Hip fracture: S/p ORIF for left acetabular fracture on [**2147-11-30**] [**12-22**] to MVA.
- Also has right patellar fracture in brace.
- The patient did not complain of pain and did well with PT.
# Aortic ectasia - This was originally seen on a CT of the chest s/p MVA.
The repeat CTA showed a stable appearing outpouching of the aortic arch, descending aortic ulceration with thrombus and small hematoma as well as small right common iliac aneurysm.
No AAA or dissection.
*Interstitial Lung Disease secondary to amiodarone toxicity: Chest CT shows severe emphysema (the patient has a significant history of tobacco as well).
He was not hypoxic prior to discharge and had no acute pulmonary issues.
# Lytic lesions in bone - This was an incidental finding on a CT of the pelvis.
Concern for metastatic disease.
The patient has a history of Barrett's esophagus, BCC.
- HE MUST see an oncologist as soon as possible for further evaluation.
- The patient was made aware of the impending diagnosis of cancer as was his son [**Name (NI) **].
-Cystic lesion noted on kidney incidentally, likely benign.
- Renal ultrasound showed 4.6 cm exophytic simple cystic lesion in left kidney.
* Hypothryoidism due to amio toxicity: The patient was found to have a mildly low TSH and multinodular thyroid goiter.
Camphor-Menthol 0.5-0.5 % Lotion Sig: One (1) Appl Topical TID (3 times a day) as needed for pruritus.
