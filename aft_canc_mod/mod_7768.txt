Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Preserved  regional and global biventricular sytolic function.
Mild pulmonary  hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-7-6**], the severity of  aortic stenosis is slightly increased.
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
No mass effect.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient presented to the ED with acute pulmonary edema due to CHF exacerbation.
She was admitted to the CCU for intensive monitoring due to the fact that she became somewhat hypotensive after diuresis of about 2-3 Liters on 40 mg IV lasix.
Cardiac enzymes were not consistent with an acute coronary syndrome.
Her CXR was significant for enalrged cardiac silhouette and pulmonary edema.
She continued to diurese overnight with no events.
On hospital day 2, her lung exam was significantly improved, although she had persistent JVD, edema, and wet lungs.
Immediately after receiving the 40 mg IV lasix, her diuresis was again too brisk and she felt weak and weas orthostatic.
Echo was consistent with diastolic heart failure and mitral valve regurgitation (see report).
She is on amiodarone and coumadin for Atrial Fibrillation.
Her dose of coumadin and her INR will have to be monitored closely for possible further adjustment.
The patient complained of abdominal distention, but no pain, at times.
She has been encouraged to undergo this test in order to explore further causes of abdominal distention such as an ovarian process.
Because of her supratherapeutic INR and the fact that she had a headache on presentation, she underwent CT of the head without contrast, which was normal.
She continued taking her Hydroxyurea for her history of Polycythemia.
