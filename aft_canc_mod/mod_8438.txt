Admission Date:  [**2200-6-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2200-6-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2150-7-4**]     Sex:  M  Service:  FENARD INTENSIVE CARE UNIT  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 49-year-old male with a history of small cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2200-3-3**] on chemotherapy and XRT as recently as one week prior to admission who was in usual state of health until a few days prior to admission when he had decreased po intake, confusion and nausea and vomiting.
The ambulance was sent to pick him up with plans to take him to [**Hospital6 **] but because he was short of breath and evaluated to be in need of immediate treatment, EMS brought him to [**Hospital3 **] for care.
He was noted to be short of breath at 4 liters per minute.
(She has a history of atrial fibrillation, but now demonstrated for rapid ventricular response).
He subsequently had a perfusion scan (apparently ventilation scan was not possible) which was interpreted as high probability for pulmonary embolus.
Although they were unable to perform the ventilation part, they did see complete perfusion defect in the right upper lobe area that was not observed to have infiltrates on the chest x-ray.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital6 2018**] Fenard Intensive Care Unit for further management in light of possible pulmonary embolus.
Depression 2.
Peptic ulcer disease requiring partial gastrectomy.
Atrial fibrillation on digoxin and diltiazem 4.
Small cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2200-3-3**] with a central lung mass treated with carboplatin BP 16, XRT initially.
No brain or bone metastases on initial staging work up.
Extensive disease in the right lung with right middle and right upper lobe compression.
Chemo help in [**2200-5-3**] apparently for poor performance status.
Microcytic anemia  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Carafate  FAMILY HISTORY:  Notable for an aunt with a deep venous thrombosis treated with urokinase at [**Hospital6 15291**] in the past.
?, heart rate 120s, blood pressure 109/52, CO2 70% on 100% nonrebreather, respiratory rate 30, weight 50 kg GENERAL:  Moderate respiratory distress.
NECK:  8 cm jugular venous distention at 45?????
?, supple, full range of motion CHEST:  Clear right upper lobe, but otherwise rhonchi and crackles bilaterally with prominent decreased breath sounds in the lower third, left greater than right.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema, cyanotic digits.
NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and oriented x3, no obvious motor or sensory abnormality.
Electrocardiogram - atrial fibrillation at 122 in S1 and at Q3, question of less than equal to [**Street Address(2) 28585**] elevation in V2 and V3, loss of R waves in V1 and V2.
PULMONARY:  Intubated emergently on arrival for hypoxic respiratory distress.
Required high levels of ventilatory support and continued poor oxygenation requiring sedation and eventually neuromuscular paralysis.
He was initially placed on fractionated heparin over concerns of a possible pulmonary embolus based on outside hospital perfusion scan results.
However, there was some concern about whether the findings could be fully compatible with pulmonary embolus given the clinical history, so the patient underwent CT angiogram of the chest which revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolus, but did show significant parenchymal abnormalities with ground glass opacities and septal thickening, left greater than right, relative sparing of the right upper lobe.
Differential diagnoses for this was broad and included possible lymphangitic spread of tumor versus pneumonia or other interstitial lung process.
Bronchoscopy was done with lavage which yielded no organisms on gram stain that could definitively diagnose the pneumonia.
There were discussions with the family about whether a video assisted thoracoscopic biopsy of the lung would be helpful in the diagnosis of his condition.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had mild electrocardiogram changes which were concerning for possible mild cardiac ischemia.
This could have been rate related, but given his electrocardiogram changes serial cardiac enzymes were sent which showed evidence of myocardial damage consistent with non ST elevations.
The patient had initially been on fractionated heparin although this had been stopped after a negative CT angiogram looking for pulmonary embolus.
It was restarted in the setting of positive cardiac enzymes.
