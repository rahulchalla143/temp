Buttressing of bronchial stump with intercostal muscle.
In follow up she developed a deep lesion in the left lower lobe that on biopsy was positive for non-small cell lung cancer.
We felt that this was a new primary cancer and therefore recommended a completion pneumonectomy.
Staging workup was negative for metastatic disease and her pulmonary function was acceptable for the proposed operation.
Thyroid cancer (papillary carcinoma), status post resection on [**2180-6-30**] and post-operative radioactive iodine; 2.
Stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer (adenocarcinoma), status post left upper lobe lobectomy on [**2180-6-30**]; 3.
Hypertension for over 5 years; 4.
Hyperlipidemia for over 5 years; 5.
Possible asymptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
This places her at an approximate 50-pack-year history of smoking.
There is no history of significant alcohol intake.
There is no history of exposure to asbestos.
There is no history of exposure to heavy chemicals or radiation.

Slight increase in amount of pleural fluid since the prior study, with major air-fluid level now at the left sixth rib level.
Small loculations of gas in the mid and lower left hemithorax has slightly decreased as well, and subcutaneous emphysema has slightly decreased.
Within the right lung, ground-glass and reticular opacities at the right upper lobe and more confluent opacity at the right base have slightly improved.
Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
Neuro: Epidural was placed pre-operatively which provided adequate pain control.
On POD 1 she developed hypotension with systolic pressures in the 60-70 range.
EKG showed lateral T-wave inversions.
This demonstrated EF >55%, no wall motion abnormalities, mild dilated RV with moderate PA HTN.
A repeat ECHO suggested low intravascular volume and a central line was placed to assist with fluid management.
On POD 7 she noted some chest discomfort after attempting ambulation with PT.
She had no further episodes of chest discomfort.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout this hospitalization.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs with normal O2 sat on oxygen.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
