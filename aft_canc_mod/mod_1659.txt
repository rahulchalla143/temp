There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
Infrahilar right-sided opacity, in correlation with prior CT, likely corresponds to calcified lymph nodes which could be treated lymphoma.
There is no pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 31303**] is a 67 year old woman with refractory CLL on C1D6 of cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and prednisone, presenting with febrile neutropenia, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and hypotension.
CXR negative for focal consolidation or pulmonary edema.
Patient had no further fevers and was transferred to the BMT floor where her fevers resolved.
Her peritoneal fluid did not have evidence of infection, but final cultures are pending and should be followed up by the pt's oncologist.
# Hypotension: Patient was admitted directly to MICU because of relative hypotension with SBPs in 80s.
Patient was asymptomatic from hypotension, though she had noted symptoms of dizziness intermittently since her last chemotherapy dose; the dizziness symptoms were described as vertigo-like, does not appear to be related to hypotension.
Per OMR notes, the patient's disease has been generally stable on bendamustine and Rituxan for several months, though her most recent scan showed growth in size of lymph nodes and worsening malignant ascites.
Her primary oncologist reports that her disease features chronic low counts due to a dysplastic marrow with poor reserve, and he has been attempting to support her counts with transfusions and GMCSF.
# Ascites: Patient has malignant ascites with a previous diagnostic tap showing cytology similar to her lymphoma.
Her last paracentesis was on [**5-21**], with peritoneal fluid analysis unrevealing for infection and cell counts repeatedly negative for SBP.
Abdomen was very distended during this hospitalization but not painful; patient underwent ultrasound-guided paracentesis by Interventional Radiology which provided the pt with good relief.
The fluid studies did not show evidence of infection but final cultures are pending and should be followed up.
She is discharged on cefpodoxime/flagyl which can cover prophylactically for SBP as well.
# Pancytopenia: Patient's hematocrit dropped from 24 to 20 in the setting of IVFs from the ED and the MICU.
It is noted that the pt developed hives to plt transfusion which responded to benadryl.
