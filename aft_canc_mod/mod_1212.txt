Admission Date:  [**2131-4-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-4-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2065-6-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Oxycontin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1865**] Chief Complaint: hypotension, GI bleeding  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: This is a 65 year old man with a history of colon cancer metastatic to lung, liver, abdominal wall, and ureter who presents with N/V, hypotension.
Apparently today he was less alert and had decreased urine output.
He was also having trouble swallowing his pills, due to being more somnolent.
R groin cordis was placed emergently due to inability to obtain BP.
OGT placed, immediately post intubation, draining 2500cc dark red blood, which did not clear with lavage.
His abdomen was noted to be rigid (in the setting of known extensive mets and GI bleed), so he underwent CT abdomen/pelvis (in addition to CTA chest).
Past Medical History: PAST ONC HISTORY: The patient initially presented in [**2125**] for evaluation of mild hematuria when a CT abd showed thickening of the sigmoid colon.
A sigmoidoscopy showed a large non-bleeding mass and he underwent sigmoid colectomy which showed moderately differentiated ulcerated adenocarcinoma reaching the serosa with [**5-18**] lymph nodes were positive for metastasis.
Since his initial presentation of stage III colon CA, he has progressed to metastatic disease to the lung, liver, abd wall, ureter.
He is status post 5-FU, irinotecan, and Avastin with disease progression.
He was recently placed on a phase 1 Reata clinical trial, which has since been held due to progression of disease.
Other PMH: 1) Metastatic colon cancer as above 2) HTN 3) Hypercholesterolemia 4) Depression 5) CRI 6) GERD  Social History: Lives with wife.
Aunt with rectal CA at the age of 85.
Left lower lobe consolidation may reflect pneumonia.
No pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic dissection.
Extensive metastatic disease has progressed compared to [**2131-1-12**], with increased hepatic and pulmonary metastases as well as increased right pleural disease.
Abdominal wall disease appears similar.
Unchanged right hydronephrosis and hydroureter with multiple nodules in the right ureter suggestive of tumor.
Persistent pulmonary vascular congestion.
Multiple pulmonary nodules which were better assessed on a CT chest from [**2131-1-12**].
Worsening retrocardiac left lower lobe opacity could be consolidative in nature.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis, without regional wall motion abnormalities.
There is severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate global left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Dilated right ventricle with severe systolic dysfunction and evidence of pressure/volume overload.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Liver US [**4-6**]: IMPRESSION: 1) No cholelithiasis.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Brief Hospital Course: 65M with metastatic colon cancer admitted with hypotension, GI bleed, pneumonia, and NSTEMI.
Possible septic sources included UTI and LLL pneumonia (seen on chest CT).
Possible aspiration event prior to intubation.
There may have also been a component of cardiogenic shock given biventricular dysfunction on TTE.
He had no PE on CTA.
Bronchoscopy [**4-5**] ruled out endobronchial obstruction.
GI bleed: Possible upper GI bleed given + NGL in ED.
Could be related to metastatic disease vs. PUD, etc.
Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated due to concern for mental status, aspiration.
Also has pneumonia, underlying pulmonary mets.
The patient was to be continued on ventilation until his mental status and sepsis resolved, though the patient was extubated on [**4-9**] after being made CMO.
Most likely pre-renal azotemia due to dehydration +/- ATN due to hypotension.
CT showed known R hydronephrosis and hydroureter, stable.
Elevated CEs/NSTEMI: Resolving.
CK and TnT initially elevated in setting of hypotension and acute renal failure.
CHF: EF 30% with moderate global LV dysfunction and RV dilatation and severe dysfunction.
No prior studies for comparison.
Liver function also abnormal, with rising LFTs, low albumin - could be contributing as well.
Likely related to progression of liver mets as well as component of shock liver in the setting of hypotension.
There is some risk of skin necrosis from this, although it was a relatively small amount of contrast.
His family was aware and an autopsy was declined  Medications on Admission: lovenox 80mg daily morphine SR 100mg [**Hospital1 **] protonix 40mg daily lorazepam 1mg hs ambien 5-10mg colace [**Hospital1 **] senna [**Hospital1 **] lisinopril 40mg (no longer taking) zofran  Discharge Medications: none patient passed away  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: metastatic colon cancer sepsis hypotension GI Bleed  Discharge Condition: deceased  Discharge Instructions: deceased  Followup Instructions: deceased
