She had ARDS and had a significant necrotizing pancreatitis at her last admission.
We were able to ride her through her pancreatic problem, without the need for an operation at that point in time, and we were able to ultimately get her out of the hospital after she recovered from her pulmonary failure problem.
She has had generally strong progression, but has been unable to gain weight, and does not eat more than soft solids, with limited amounts.
She claims of abdominal pain when she eats, as well as regurgitation.
We also knew that we would have to address her gallbladder and its stone disease at some point in time.

ABD: soft, mildly distended, no tympany, diffuse tenderness Wound: dressing with serosanguinous drainage Ext: DP 2+ bilat., no edema Neuro: Awake, alert and oriented   Pertinent Results: US INTR-OP 60 MINS  [**2187-8-7**] 10:20 AM  US INTR-OP 60 MINS  Reason: PSEUDOCYST  INDICATION: Patient with complicated pancreatitis and pseudocyst formation.
For possible surgical cystgastrostomy.
Using sterile technique, intraoperative son[**Name (NI) 867**] was performed using transgastric approach and also from an intragastric position.
Corresponding to the pancreas' position, there is an ill-defined, enlarged isoechogenic material likely representing a phlegmon.
No discrete fluid collection is seen elsewhere.
CONCLUSION:  No evidence of large pseudocyst corresponding to recent CT images  CHOLANGIOGRAM,IN OR W FILMS  [**2187-8-7**] 9:54 AM  CHOLANGIOGRAM,IN OR W FILMS  Reason: CHOLANGIOGRAM  INDICATION: Intraoperative cholangiogram.
FINDINGS: Eight spot films were provided from intraoperative fluoroscopic guidance for cholangiogram.
Images demonstrate filling of normal appearing biliary tree without filling defects or stricture and free passage of ontrast into the duodenum with some reflux into distal pancreatic duct.
No inflammation.
