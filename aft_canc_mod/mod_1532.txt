Admission Date:  [**2173-10-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-10-29**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Vancomycin / Oxycodone / Lorazepam  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath, tachycardia, mouth sores  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 31205**] is an 89 year old male with history of COPD and tracheo-bronchial malacia (recently stented) who is presenting from rehab with tachycardia, worsening oral ulcers and difficulty breathing.
Patient reports onset 10 days ago with progressive worsening of breathing difficulty, especially worse at night.
No CP, no cough, no ABP/N/V/F/C, no lower extremity swelling, no increased orthopnea (3 pillows).
Upon arrival to the ICU team, respiratory therapy was at the bedside and recommended that non-rebreather may be a more comfortable option for him given his extensive oral ulcers which were bleeding.
On [**2172-10-20**], he had more hoarsness and went for a revision of the T tube with IP.
Additionally, sputum grew out GPC and GNR and he was placed empirically on vanc and levo (history of Stenotrophomonas, E. coli, and MRSA in bronchial washings from [**2172-10-7**]).
After discussion with ID fellow, the primary team started cefepime given the resistance of E. coli from culture on [**2172-10-7**], which was sensitive only to zosyn, meropenem, and gentamicin.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.

Past Medical History: - Tracheo bronchomalacia s/p stent [**9-5**] and multiple bronchs - s/p tracheostomy [**9-/2172**] - [**Year (4 digits) **] stage III COPD - Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation - CAD s/p CABG - CKD (baseline creatinine 1.5-2.1) - Aortic Stenosis - Prostate Ca - CLL - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - GERD - Depression - Vit B12 defic - Arthritis - Ventral hernia - Hx of enterococcal urosepsis - Cholecysttectomy PSH: Silicon wire stent placement in [**8-/2171**], s/p CABG and then  stent within last 10 years, CCY  Social History: He lives alone in a senior's facility.
He has no known exposure to asbestos or tuberculosis, and has no pets.
Family History: No family history of pulmonary disease  Physical Exam: Admission PE: Vitals: T: 99.1 BP: 116/92 P: 100-140s R: 30 O2: 100% NRB General: Alert, oriented, speaks very softly but appropriate HEENT: Sclera anicteric, oropharynx with bleeding ulcers, very dry Neck: supple, JVP not elevated (~ 7 cm) Lungs: very decreased breath sounds bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: irregularly irregular, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: chronic foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema  Discharge PE: Continued intermittent difficulty with breathing, improved with suctioning and reassurance.
Lung volumes are markedly low which limits the [**Month/Day/Year 2742**].
Allowing for these limitations, there is no focal consolidation, effusion, pneumothorax.
Mediastinal contour appears grossly stable though when compared with prior CT from [**2172-10-2**] mediastinal widening likely reflects ectatic vasculature.
There are persistent low lung volumes with bibasilar scattered atelectasis.
There are no new focal opacities concerning for pneumonia.
The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable with a tortuous somewhat dilated thoracic aorta.
IMPRESSION: No significant change since [**2173-10-27**] with no evidence of pneumonia.
Wide complex rhythm.
Right bundle-branch block.
Brief Hospital Course: 89 year old male with PMH of severe COPD and tracheobronchomalacia s/p stenting, atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, HTN/HL, and current C. difficile infection who initially presented with tachycardia, mouth sores, and shortness of breath consistent with recurrent COPD exacerbation.
ACTIVE issues:  # Dyspnea/COPD excacerbation: He presented with significant shortness of breath and tachycardia that improved with CPAP, nebulizers, routine airway care, and re-initiation of steroids.
We initially prescribed Azithromycin for COPD exacerbation, but then switched him over to levofloxacin to cover a suspected lower lobe pneumonia.
Albuterol/ipratroprium nebs and prednisone were continued until discharge and the levofloxacin should be continued for another 4 days (5 day course) for a suspected right lower lobe pneumonia.
For his persistent recurrence of COPD exacerbations, he should be continued on chronic prednisone at 10mg for now.
# Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation: We controlled his atrial fibrillation with rate control (uptitration of beta-blocker to metoprolol 25mg TID), rhythm control (amiodarone at prior dosing), and anticoagulation with warfarin as prior.
We believe that his hypoxia likely contributed to his initial poorly controlled atrial fibrillation.
# LUE edema:  On admission, his arm was swollen, but ultrasound was negative for DVT and his INR was therapeutic throughout.
# C. diff infection:  Positive toxin at rehab on [**10-19**].
# Oral ulcerations: Rehab hospital felt these were due to the linezolid he previously received.
Herpetic lesions seemed much less likely.
We decided not to continue using this secondary to worsened pain with the medication.
# Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG [**2156**]( LIMA->LAD, SVG-diagonal,  SVG-OM, SVG-LPL): Continued on statin and BB, ASA, as above.
# Chronic kidney disease: Cr at baseline (1.4-1.5), likely secondary to chronic hypertension.
# Aortic stenosis: Moderate with valve area of 1.0-1.2cm2.
# Depression: Continue olanzapine .
