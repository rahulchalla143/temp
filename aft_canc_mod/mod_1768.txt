Admission Date:  [**2151-4-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-4-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-9-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine / Hayfever  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: Dark stool  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Enteroscopy  History of Present Illness: 75 year old male with past medical history of clear cell carcinoma s/p right nephrectomy and adrenectomy with metastasis to pancreas, duodenal wall and pulmonary (nodules) s/p Whipple procedure in [**2143**] complicated by injury to hepatic artery.
He had DVT in [**2149**] for which coumadin was started with subsequent GI bleed requiring 9 units of PRBC thought to be secondary to jejunal AVM.
Repeat endoscopy showed small gastric angiodysplasia which was treated with BICAP.
He was noted to have increase in jejunal mass on routine surveillance CT scan by oncology in [**12/2150**] which was decided to be managed conservative.
He had guiaic positive stool though no symptoms of chest pain, fatigue, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, hemoptysis.
He was also noted to have fever (unsure if during or after PrBC).
On arrival to the MICU, he reports no complaints.
Per GI, a CTA was ordered and found increased size of epigastric mass since [**2151-11-19**], now 3.7 x 3.2 cm  (previously 3.3 x 2.8) in addition to a stable sized enhancing mass protruding into jejunum.
CTA also noted slightly increased intra and extra hepatic biliary dilation, concerning for mass obstructing the hepaticojejunostomy.
There was no evidence for acute bleeding.
Patient was comfortable with no acute complaints.
His last bowel movement was yesterday and he denies any dizziness, LH or chest pain.
Past Medical History: Clear cell carcinoma with metastasis to pancreas, lung and duodenal wall HTN Type 2 DM DVT in [**2149**] TKR in [**2149**] Transamnitis s/p pacemaker for symptomatic bradycardia   Social History: - Tobacco:  Never - Alcohol:  Sometimes a glass of wine with dinner - Illicits:  No   Family History: Mom with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer   Physical Exam: Admission physical exam: Vitals: T:97.2 BP:89/42 P:95 R:18 O2:99%2LNC General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL Neck: supple, JVP at 8 cm, no LAD CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: Bibasilar crackles Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly GU: no foley.
guiaic positive stool Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: CNII-XII intact, 5/5 strength upper/lower extremities, grossly normal sensation.
Pancreatic and jejunal masses post-Whipple procedure, consistent with known renal cell carcinoma metastases.
A fungating mass with markedly irregular borders is seen in the jejunal limb at the pancreaticojejunal anastomosis.
No definite evidence of active extravasation of contrast observed, with multiple frond-like enhancing projections felt to be connected to the lesion itself.
However, please note that in the setting of known GI bleeding, this lesion represents a likely source of bleeding.
Interval enlargement of pancreatic and jejunal masses consistent with increase in metastatic disease.
New intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation to the level of the hepaticojejunal anastomosis.
Equivocal increased thickening of the left adrenal gland medial limb; attention on next followup imaging recommended.
Fluid or soft tissue nodule in an umbilical fat-containing hernia, stable to decreased in size.
Enteroscopy ([**2151-4-20**]) Impression: Esophageal ulcer Normal mucosa in the stomach The biliary and enteral limbs were intubated.
The biliary limb contained a couple of small blood clots.
There was no other evidence of recent bleeding or a source of bleeding.
Otherwise normal EGD to enteral and biliary jejunal limbs  Recommendations: The findings do not account for the symptoms If rebleeding occurs, would consider a flex sig to ensure no rectal pathology but most likely bleeding related to mets in the biliary limb.
If rebleeds, would call IR for embolization of metatatic disease.
Would also consider discussion with outpatient providers to determine plan of care moving forward as the metastatic disease is likely to process and may well bleed again.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 year old male with past medical history of clear cell carcinoma s/p right nephrectomy and adrenectomy with metastasis to pancreas, duodenal wall and pulmonary (nodules) s/p Whipple procedure in [**2143**] complicated by injury to hepatic artery and GI bleed in [**2149**] on anticoaguation from jejunal AVM presents with mahogany colored stools.
GI bleed:  Source is thought to be secondary to jejunal AVM vs erosion from metastatic jejunal mass which has been increasing in size.
Elevated INR thought to be secondary to malnutrition.
No source of infection noted on exam or review of labs and imaging here.
Afebrile during remainder of hospitalization.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary- GI bleed Secondary- Renal cell carcinoma with metastasis to pancreas, lung small bowel            Hypertension            Type II diabetes mellitus            DVT- [**2149**]    Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
An outside hospital EGD and colonscopy did not demonstrate any acute source of the bleed and you were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
While here, you underwent a CT scan which demonstrated enlargement of your small bowel mass, which was the most likely cause of the bleed.
The oncology, gastroenterology, general surgery, interventional radiology and radiation oncology teams discussed your case at length and determined that radiation therapy would be beneficial to you.
