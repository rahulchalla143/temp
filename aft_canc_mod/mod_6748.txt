Admission Date:  [**2119-4-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-4-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-11-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6346**] Chief Complaint: Complicated incisional ventral hernia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, small bowel resection, ileal transverse colectomy, jejunojejunostomy, ileal colostomy, component separation, ventral hernia repair with biologic material and polypropylene mesh.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of a strangulated hernia repair complicated by an open wound.
He reports that there has been some increased bulging at the incision, and developed a large ventral hernia after surgery.
Past Medical History: PMHx: pneumonia, Sepsis s/p ileocecetomy and incarcerated hernia repair .
LUNGS: CTA(B) COR: RRR; no m/c/r ABD: Protuberant with large midline incision with staples extending from epigastric area to supra-pubic area.
(R)LQ JP drain intact/patent with serisanginous output.
Mild retrocardiac atelectasis at the base.
Again, there is an area of increased opacification at the right base that could represent merely crowding of pulmonary markings related to relatively low lung volumes.
PATHOLOGY: [**2119-4-5**] SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: small bowel, ABDOMINAL WALL SKIN, GREATER OMENTUM, TRANSVERSE COLON.
Abdominal wall skin, excision (D-F): Skin with scar and epidermal ulceration.
Large and small intestines with few inflammatory polyps and focal mucosal ulcerations.
Changes consistent with previous surgery.
It consists of an unoriented segment of small bowel which measures 13.1 cm in and 3.1 cm in diameter.
Representative sections are submitted as follows: A  = margins, B = representative sections of mucosa, C = representative sections of mesenteric fat.
It consists of multiple fragments of skin which measure 23 x 10.1 x 3.9 cm in aggregate.
There are multiple areas of scar and thickened skin.
The thickest skin measures 1.5 cm in thickness and appears to be composed of scar tissue.
It consists of a red/yellow fibroadipose which measures 14 x 12 x 9.5 cm.
It consists of an unoriented segment of large bowel which measures 52 cm long and 5.1 cm in diameter.
The specimen is opened to reveal multiple black/yellow polyps at one end which measure 2.5 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm and comes to within 0.5 cm of one end.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service for surgical management of a large, complicated ventral incisional hernia.
On [**2119-4-5**], the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, small bowel resection, ileal transverse colectomy, jejunojejunostomy, ileal colostomy, component separation, ventral hernia repair with biologic material and polypropylene mesh, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
Post-operatively, the patient was admitted to the TICU as anesthesia was unable to extubate him in the PACU due to respiratory failure secondary to respiratory acidosis.
The patient arrived NPO with an NG tube, on IV fluids, with an abdominal binder, foley catheter and two JP drains in place, and initially Propofol drip and Dilaudid IV PRN for pain control.
Post-operative pain was initially not well controlled.
He received two doses of Haldol IV with symptomatic resolution, and clearing of his mental status later that day.
The patient subsequently voided without problem.
The large midline incision remained clean and intact.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
Dilaudid 2mg 1 tab PO Q3-4Hours PRN pain 2.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for constipation: Over-the-counter.
Complicated ventral incisional hernia with intraabdominal loss of domain secondary large defect.
Incision Care:  *Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision site.
*You may shower, and wash surgical incisions with a mild soap and warm water.
JP Drain Care: *Please look at the site every day for signs of infection (increased redness or pain, swelling, odor, yellow or bloody discharge, warm to touch, fever).
*Make sure to keep the drain attached securely to your body to prevent pulling or dislocation.
