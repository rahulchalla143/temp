+ N/V and decreased po intake.
States pain radiates to her back.
CXR demonstrated R pleural effusion.
Bedside US showed large pericardial effusion with evidence of tamponade.
Post procedure TTE showed near complete resolution of pericardial effusion.
In [**1-29**] she palpated a mass in the left breast and underwent a breast biopsy that showed triple negative breast carcinoma.
MRI [**2185-11-23**] that showed multiple brain metastases.
Hypercholesterolemia   Social History: She worked at WGBH as a data entry personnel.
Mother died of complications from pancreatitis.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2186-2-12**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):     ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2186-2-10**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
The P-R interval is short without evidence of pre-excitation.
Right axis deviation.
Low voltag in the precordial leads.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Severe pericardial tamponade.
Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal views.
Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
***IMAGING*** [**2-9**] CXR IMPRESSION: Right pleural effusion likely with a subpulmonic component resulting in adjacent atelectasis of the right lung base.
A focal consolidation is difficult to exclude in this area.
[**2-10**] CXR Dense opacification of the lower right hemithorax has worsened consistent with lower lobe and middle lobe collapse, which is probably an underlying subpulmonic effusion.
Enlarged cardiac silhouette is not well evaluated with the right hemithoracic opacification.
Small to moderate right pleural effusion with only minimal anterior loculation.
Small dependent left pleural effusion and very small pericardial effusion are also new from the prior CT. 2.
Collapse of right middle and right lower lobes without evidence of obstructing lesion.
Associated marked elevation of right hemidiaphragm.
New fullness of renal collecting systems, right greater than left.
Persistent mediastinal lymphadenopathy with new nonspecific stranding of mediastinal fat.
[**2-11**] Renal U/S Redemonstration of right moderate and mild left hydronephrosis compared to [**2186-2-10**] is unchanged, but new since [**2185-11-21**].
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 40F with stage IIIB breast cancer with progression to brain mets who presented with dyspnea and a large pericardial effusion + tamponade physiology.
Pericardial effusion: Given history of advanced breast cancer likely a malignant effusion.
No evidence of polys on initial pleural fluid to suggest infection.
Signs of pericardial tamponade were seen on initial echo with improvement of hemodynamics and no residual effusion after tap.
Of note, she has not been exposed to anthracyclines or recent XRT to the chest wall.
Echo done on [**2-10**] showed no pericardial effusion.
Fluid chemistries consistent with a serosanguinous exudate.
No evidence of recurrence of effusion/tamponade.
Fluid Gram stain negative for microorgs.
Pt underwent repeat ECHO, which showed improvement in RV dilatation, and no pericardial effusion.
# Pneumonia: Pt with recent diagnosis of PNA at OSH based on persistent low grade fevers, SOB, cough, and LUL infiltrate on CXR.
# Pleural effusions: CT scan showed right sided pleural effusion with small anterior loculations, RML/RLL collapse.
# Hydronephrosis - Renal US demonstrates moderate right and mild left hydronephrosis.
Breast cancer: Stage IIIB, ER/PR/HER2 triple negative with progression to metastatic disease.
Of note, tumor was large and approached the chest wall treated with neoadjuvant cyclophosphamide and taxotere, surgery, and XRT to the chest wall.
Pt with brain mets without evidence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.
Tachycardia: Likely compensatory from tamponade physiology, toxic metabolic state, and volume depletion from recent poor PO intake.
Patient remains tachycardic although improved however suspect now that clinically euvolemic, may be secondary to cancer.
Repeat ECHO did not show pericardial effusion.
Ibuprofen 400 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours): Take until chest pain is gone, then discontinue.
Codeine-Guaifenesin  Oral   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Malignant Pericardial Effusion Metastatic Breast Cancer   Discharge Condition: stable.
Discharge Instructions: You had a fluid collection around your heart that was caused by the cancer.
The fluid was removed and the echocardiogram today showed that you had no fluid reaccumulation today.
Your chest x-ray showed the pleural effusions were somewhat better.
Your chest pain is because of the irritation of the lining around your heart after the fluid removal.
You can take Motrin (Ibuprofen) every 8 hours as needed for this chest pain.
You have a CT of your abdomen and pelvis ordered to better assess some fluid collection around your kidneys.
Please call your doctor if your chest pain worsens, if you have symptoms that are similar to the symptoms that led you to come to the hospital, if you have trouble breathing or for any other concerning symptoms.
