Noncontrast CT chest revealed a mass at the right hilum that was obstructing his right upper lobe; also with 2 subcentimeter nodules in LUL concerning for satellite nodules, RUL consolidation concerning for post-obstructive pneumonia, mediastinal adenopathy.
Noted to have purulent sputum.
Increased hypoxia with ABG 7.33/42/60 on 4LNC.
He developed an increasing oxygen requirement of 30L/min of high flow O2.
Regarding right hilar mass, bronchoscopy postponed due to increasing oxygen requirement.
Hospital course also complicated by hypercalcemia improved with IVF and pamidronate, delirium suspected secondary to infection/malignancy.
Review of systems otherwise limited secondary to malfunctioned hearing aids.

No evidence of an acute pathologic intracranial process.
Opacification of bilateral mastoid air cells and middle ears.
Please correlate clinically to exclude mastoiditis and otitis media.
Findings are concerning for right hilar mass with post-obstructive consolidation in the right upper lobe.
Mild overhydration.
[**2153-4-9**] LENI: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Worsening poststenotic opacification involving the right upper lobe.
New near subtotal collapse of the right lower lobe and a worsened now severe in size right pleural effusion.
Associated compression of the right main stem bronchi and distal branches and the right main pulmonary artery.
Newly developed moderate left effusion.
Multiple hypoattenuating liver lesions, incompletely assessed and a soft tissue lesion is seen abutting the left hemidiaphragm that in given setting of disease is highly concerning for metastasis.
Circular area of low attenuation seen in the right atrium that is probably caused by venous inflow from non-opacified inferior vena caval blood, although the possibility of thrombus still exists.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 36565**] is a 53 year old gentleman with Alport's Syndrome s/p cadaveric renal transplant in [**2147**], PPD+, and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**] [**2151**] who was admitted with respiratory distress in the setting of a new right hilar mass.
Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial, including right hilar mass compression of right upper lobe bronchus, RUL pneumonia.
Despite immunosuppression and elevated LDH, PCP less likely based on CT chest findings.
Patient was treated with 14 days of Vancomycin and Zosyn for post-obstructive pneumonia (day 1 = [**2153-4-1**]).
Sputum GS and culture showed polymicrobial infection, which grew only commensal organisms.
This was thought to be due to mucous plugging as his CXR was unchanged, so he was started on guaifenesin 1200mg [**Hospital1 **].
[**2153-4-9**] he had an increased oxygen requirement in the setting of aggressive fluids for hypercalcemia, and a CTA chest was done.
No PE seen, but his hilar mass had grown and he had large effusions.
Right hilar mass: Concern for malignancy vs infection vs less likely inflammatory.
Patient underwent bronchoscopy by IP after he was ruled out for TB for which tissue from a cervical lymph node and brushings from the large mass were sampled.
Final pathology results showed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
Initially the plan was for outpatient work-up, but the patient's respiratory status worsened and [**2153-4-9**] showed interval worsening of the mass.
On [**4-14**], Mr. [**Known lastname 19688**] became hypotensive to SBP 80s on the floor.
He was given 500cc IVF bolus with SBP increase to 90s.
Patient denied any pain, sob, chest pain, dizziness or LH.
The cause of death was rapid respiratory compromise from a very aggressive poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung, which may have been especially aggressive in the setting of pts post-transplant immunosuppression.
Hypercalcemia: PTH low at 10, phos low normal and PTHrp negative at [**Hospital 8**] hospital, making bony mets the most likely source of hypercalcemia.
# Altered Mental Status: Patient often with hallucinations in ICU.
Head CT negative for bleed or metastases.
Infection and hypercalcemia treated as above.
Chronic kidney disease s/p cadaveric transplant: Patient was transplanted by [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2147**].
Medications on Admission: - Tacrolimus (Prograf) 2mg [**Hospital1 **] - Myfortic 180mg PO BID - Simvastatin 80mg PO daily - Bactrim DS 800-160 PO daily - Atenolol 50mg PO daily - Losartan 50mg PO daily - Norvasc 10mg PO daily - Flomax 0.4mg PO daily - Folic acid 1mg PO daily   Discharge Medications: expired  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Respiratory distress Right hilar mass Adenocarcinoma of the lung   Discharge Condition: expired  Discharge Instructions: expired  Followup Instructions: expired   Completed by:[**2153-4-17**
