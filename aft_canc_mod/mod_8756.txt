Past Medical History: Onc Hx: -In end of [**2183-9-29**] presented with imbalance, short-term [**Last Name **] problem, flat affect, and urinary urgency.
-[**2183-11-3**] MRI showed Large heterogeneous infiltrative mass in the right frontal lobe, extending into the left anterior corpus callosum -a stereotaxic brain biopsy by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D., Ph.D. on [**2183-11-5**] confirming Glioblastoma -started temozolomide chemo-irradiation on [**2183-11-18**].

cataractsurgery in right eye hypertension typical values of 150/80.
neck: supple CV: RRR, no m/r/g nl S1 and S2 lungs: CTA BL abd: ND, NT +BS, no HSM ext: no edema neuro: Pt speech is slow but appropriate, however not responding to all questions.
weakness in L SCM.
no tongue deviation.
Infiltrative right frontal mass lesion consistent with glioblastoma multiforme as suggested in the history.
New areas of slow diffusion in the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle and in the subarachnoid space along the falx of the right vertex (which appears to be associated with enhancement) may represent tumor seeding, however, these findings are concerning for infection and clinical correlation is recommended.
[**2183-11-28**]: EEG:  This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background and the multifocal intermittent slowing.
The first abnormality suggests a mild encephalopathy, whereas the second one suggests multifocal subcortical dysfunction.
There were no epileptiform features seen.
There is no pleural effusion.
[**11-29**] CT head: No interval change from [**2183-11-24**], with a large right frontal lobe necrotic mass, extending into the corpus callosum with associated vasogenic edema.

Glioblastoma: Presenting with evidence of frontal lobe dysfunction, magnetic gait and slowed speech.
In additiona diffuse left weakness concerning for worsening brain edema.
Edema may be worsening in setting of recent decrease in decadron.
s/p recent becacizumab making hemmorhage likely although [**11-24**] ct without evidence of bleed.
MRI brain prelim showed no hemmorhage, edema similar to previous imaging.
An EEG was obtained which did not show any seizure activity but had evidence of encephalopathy.
Despite high dose acyclovir and correction of his hyponatremia Dr.[**Known lastname 87904**] MS deteriorated to the point that he could no longer protect his airway.
Hyponatremia: differential includes SIADH or hypovolemic hyponatremia [**3-1**] poor po intake.
Started on hypertonic saline, transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for worsening hyponatremia.
