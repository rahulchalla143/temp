Pertinent Results: CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS  [**2159-3-1**] 10:00 PM IMPRESSION: 1) Multiple hemorrhagic lesions seen throughout the brain as above, with large mediastinal nodal masses and multiple pulmonary nodules.
These findings are highly suspicious for metastatic disease (perhaps RCC or melanoma).
2) Left orbital enhancing lesion intimately associated with the superior rectus muscle, likely a metastasis.
3) No aneurysm or significant stenosis, involving the vasculature of the head and neck.
Minimal bilateral carotid bulb atherosclerotic disease.
4) Advanced emphysema.
Centrilobular emphysema is also identified.
Multiple innumerable subcentimeter hypodensities are also seen diffusely throughout the liver, which could represent tiny metastases versus biliary hamartomas.
There is no intra- or extra- hepatic biliary duct dilatation.
Within the left adrenal gland, a 22 x 18 mm enhancing mass is demonstrated most consistent with metastasis.
However, within the inferior pole of the left kidney, a 28 x 26 mm hypodense lesion appears to demonstrate mild enhancement after contrast administration and is not clearly a simple cyst.
Enlarged retroperitoneal lymph node within the left periaortic region measuring up to 16 mm wide is identified.
There is no free air or free fluid.
There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.
Multiple subcutaneous nodules are demonstrated within the abdomen and pelvis, the largest of which is within the subcutaneous fat of the right pelvis measuring up to 7 mm.
Coarse prostatic calcifications are identified.
Small bowel-containing, large, left inguinal hernia is demonstrated.
The bowel appears non-obstructed without evidence of bowel wall thickening.
A large, fat-containing right inguinal hernia is also demonstrated.
No inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy is identified.
There is no free fluid.
Multiple small subcutaneous nodules are demonstrated within the subcutaneous fat as well as adjacent to the left gluteus maximus muscle measuring up to 10 mm wide.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
Widespread metastatic disease involving the lungs, liver, left adrenal gland, and subcutaneous tissues.
Innumerable subcentimeter hypodense lesions within the liver may represent innumerable tiny metastases versus biliary hamartomas.
Multiple hypodense lesions in both kidneys, the majority of which are cysts.
One hypodense lesion in the left kidney, however, demonstrates mild enhancement and does not meet criteria for simple cyst.
Large, small bowel-containing, left inguinal hernia.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2159-3-2**] 5:44 PM CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient for postoperative MRI following evacuation of right-sided hematoma and evidence of multiple metastasis.
FINDINGS: There are postoperative changes identified in the right frontotemporal region.
There is mild mass effect seen on the right lateral ventricle.
Multiple hyperintense masses, indicating enhancing lesions are identified predominantly in the posterior fossa and right cerebral hemisphere.
Additional 3 small enhancing lesions are seen in the right occipital lobe and at least two small enhancing lesions are seen in the right frontal lobe.
The lesions in the right frontal lobe and right cerebellum measure approximately 1 cm in size with an additional 5-10 mm lesion in the right cerebellum.
Most of the other lesions measure 5 mm or smaller.
A faint enhancement is also identified in the left temporal lobe anteriorly which is suggestive of an additional metastasis.
DIAGNOSIS: #1, RIGHT TEMPORAL LOBE HEMORRHAGIC TUMOR BIOPSY (including intraoperative smear and frozen section): METASTATIC MALIGNANT MELANOMA.
#2, RIGHT TEMPORAL LOBE HEMORRHAGIC TUMOR RESECTION: METASTATIC MALIGNANT MELANOMA.
NOTE: Intermixed within the blood clot are frequent small clusters of highly malignant cells having large nuclei, a prominent nucleolus, and fine cytoplasmic pigment.
These cytologic features are diagnostic of metastatic melanoma.
Right temporal tumor hematoma for evacuation; suspect underlying malignancy.
Part 2 is additionally labeled "right temporal lobe tumor" and consists of an aggregate of red brown blood clot with scant fragment of tan tissue, measuring 4.1 x 3.4 x 0.9 cm.
The head CT showed a large right sided temporal hemorrhage, measuring approximately 5 x 5 cm with uncal herniation, incipient midline shift, transfalcine herniation.
The derm consult they recommended a biopsy of the a lesion on the foot which turned out to be a dyplastic nevus and to get any old records of his possible history of melanoma.
His PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] but she did not have any history of his having melanoma in the past.
On POD 2 he went into rapid atrial fibrillation so he was started on an amiodarone drip.
On POD 5 he pulled out his dobhoff and he was re-evaluatated by speech and swallow which he passed.
On POD 6 it was noted that he had a left inguinal hernia so general surgery was consulted and it was decided due to life expectancy and that this is a chronic problem with no signs of obstruction that surgery was not an opition at this time.
