HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to [**Hospital6 1708**] in [**2129-7-23**] for 10 days of abdominal pain and right upper quadrant tenderness.
The right and left hepatic ducts were clipped and a drain placed.
The patient had persistent bile leak and was sent to IR for guided biliary drain placement.
The patient also developed R PV and R HV thrombosis.
The patient also found to have a 4 cm lobulated mass in the mid pole of the right kidney.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The patient appeared jaundiced, in no acute distress.
Lungs were clear bilaterally with decreased breath sounds in the right lower lobe.
Abdomen was soft, nondistended, right upper quadrant tenderness, positive bowel sounds, capped biliary drain, and a healed open cholecystectomy scar.
Bilateral dorsalis pedis pulses.
It was noted on a chest x-ray that he had a right pleural effusion.
Tube feed recommendations were recommended due to patient's risk for decreased p.o.
for procedures.
Opacification of the ducts in the lateral segment of the left lobe of the liver was noted.
This was draining into the first portion of the duodenum through a widely patent, but slightly irregular tract.
Thrombosis of the right portal vein with a nonocclusive thrombus was seen within the proximal left portal vein with involvement of segment [**Doctor First Name 690**] and IVb and proximal segment III involvement.
A clip was noted at the base of the left hepatic duct, as well as a clip at the base of the right hepatic duct, and a third clip just distal to the common hepatic duct which was not seen.
There was mild right intrahepatic biliary dilatation communicating with the subcapsular, multiloculated bilomas.
There was concern for infection.
Stenosis of the origin of the gastroduodenal artery and the left hepatic artery with patent flow distally was noted in the hepatic arteries.
No right proximal hepatic artery was seen.
The distal peripheral right hepatic artery branches were seen, but their feeding arteries were not seen.
Right renal carcinoma was noted infiltrating the lower pole of the right kidney.
This collection was perihepatic and subphrenic seen on the MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**2129-10-26**].
There was successful CT-guided drainage, and a catheter placed within the right subphrenic/perihepatic collection.
Moderate right pleural effusion was noted with adjacent atelectasis.
The patient was given oxycodone for pain on the right side of his abdomen.
It was noted that he was short of breath with minimal exertion despite wearing O2.
A nephrology was obtained for acute renal failure.
Recommendations included renally dosing all medications with avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs.
A UA demonstrated red blood cells, a small amount of bilirubin, 1+ protein, and muddy brown granular casts.
During this time, his vital signs were stable, although he did experience a drop in his red blood cell count from a baseline of 28.4 down to 24.2.
He did experience some diarrhea after starting his tube feedings.
His urine output improved with resolving acute renal failure.
There was a stable moderate to large right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
There was also stable right renal cell carcinoma and bilateral renal cysts.
On [**2129-11-3**], he underwent a PICC placement with satisfactory position in the mid SVC.
There was interval increase in the size of the right-sided pleural effusion.
No evidence of intraperitoneal hemorrhage was noted.
The right hepatic collection containing the drainage catheter was largely unchanged in appearance, and again a moderate to large right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis was unchanged.
Patient was preopped for right hepatic resection with right nephrectomy for bile duct injury and renal cell carcinoma, right portal vein thrombosis and right hepatic vein thrombosis.
