She saw her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2157-12-29**], where she reportedly collapsed and was hypotensive and unresponsive.
A CT abdomen showed dilation of her CBD and intrahepatic ducts.
GI was consulted who felt she had cholangitis due to biliary obstruction.
ID was consulted who recommending covering for urospesis and aspiration pna, and flagyl was added when the obstructed picture arouse.
Her increased cardiac enzymes were thought to be due to demand ischemia.
Her EKG was noted as no acute changes.
She had an EEG for her LOC, which showed no seizure activity.
CT head is reported as no acute change and meningioma and slit-like ventricles.
Prior to transfer, her mechanical ventilation was PSV15/5, FiO2 35%, and small lung volumes.
MICU events significant for: On [**12-31**] AM she underwent [**Month/Year (2) **] showing biliary ostruction but no cholangitis.
[**1-2**] blood cultures from [**Hospital3 2568**] showed Klebsiella resistant to ampicillin and pan-sensitive E coli.
She was then extubated but had copious respiratory secretions requiring frequent suctioning.
Also received IVF for pleural effusion.
Patient is very difficult to communicate with currently, as she is hypophonic and Polish is her primary language.
I spoke with her daughter [**Name (NI) 84165**], who states that her mother is much improved today in terms of alertness and is uncomfortable due to her pressure sore on her back.

Successful intubation of the esophagus with a duodenoscope over a guidewire and with direct visual laryngoscopy.
A moderate diffuse dilation was seen at the main duct with the CBD measuring 13-14 mm.
There were no filling defects or strictures seen.
There was no sludge or pus seen.
Recommendations: The findings of the [**Year (4 digits) **] are consistent with biliary obstruction, but not cholangitis.
Her obstruction may be due to papillary stenosis or a periampullary lesion.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 84164**] is a 87 yo female with PMH of meningioma and seizure disorder who presented to [**Hospital6 1597**] on [**2157-12-29**] with urosepsis.
She developed question of cholangitis and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU for [**Hospital1 **].
# Klebsiella and E coli septicemia, hypotension, UTI, biliary obstruction, clinical cholangitis - This improved on broad spectrum antibiotics and she was narrowed to cipro monotherapy, following an [**Hospital1 **] ([**12-31**]) to relieve obstruction (s/p stent).
Cardiac: The patient ruled in for a Type II NSTEMI due to demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension and sepsis with positive troponins.
There were no significant EKG changes.
Tegretol was initially held d/t dysphagia and was restarted on [**2158-1-9**].
The patient and her daughter were strongly against OGT or NGT for enteral feedings.
Repeat S+S eval on [**1-9**] revealed ongoing intermittent aspiration of her baseline ground solids and honey thickened liquids, consistent with or better than her previous baseline.
Pt and daughter accept risk of aspiration with resuming oral diet.
Pt had been found to have oral thrush and this was treated aggressively to maximize chance to tolerate oral diet (see below).
- Encourage oral intake.
# Oral thrush - Fluconazole IV x 5 days; completed - received nystatin oral swabs as well .
# Acute renal failure: She suffered acute renal failure while critically ill; this resolved as she recovered hemodynamic stability with IV fluids.
# hoarseness/hypophonia - The patient developed hypophonia following extubation; suspect this was from mechanical ventilation.
# hemangioma, obstructive hydrocephalus s/p VP shunt - Radiologic findings of possible overshunting but unclear if this is acute.
Given improvement in mental status and stability radiographically of the meningioma, doubt that this is clinically significant.
