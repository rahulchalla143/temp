His CI was high, so his hypotension was not felt to be due to cardiogenic shock.
His noncontrast chest CT showed a RLL rounded opacity with no air bronchograms but density consistent with lung parenchyma.
The differential was thought to include atelectasis vs. postobstructive pneumonia vs. sequestration.
He underwent a bronchoscopy on [**9-18**] with mild secretions and no endobronchial lesions visualized, and a BAL was sent.
His ventilatory requirements were gradually weaned, however he had trouble ventilating adequately while on pressure support.
CT chest with contrast showed the RLL opacity was a large mass with significant surrounding lymphadenopathy and marked pleural tumor, with possible invasion into the chest wall.
Pleural fluid cytology returned suspicious for adenocarcinoma, and pt was ultimately diagnosed with stage IIIA lung cancer.
Pt's progressive respiratory failure was treated with BiPAP and nebs, but he continually removed his BiPAP, leading to significantly labored breathing and desaturation.
Pt ultimately died of respiratory failure likely due to a combination of COPD, pneumonia and lung cancer on the morning of [**2191-10-3**].
# Altered mental status: She had a subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage on CT. Neurosurgery was consulted, and felt that the bleed was likely an effect of reperfusion during arrest.
He had leukocytosis but no fever, and no history of headache at home, so meningitis was thought to be unlikely and LP was deferred.
# ARF: It was thought likely secondary to hypoperfusion/ATN in the setting of cardiac arrest and shock.
He was felt to have an upper GI bleed in the setting of heparin and integrilin in the cath lab, and it was self-resolved.
His CT was reviewed by Radiology who stated there was no evidence of esophageal perforation.
Pt was maintained on full comfort measures once a family meeting concluded that he sould be made DNR/DNI w/o further aggressive management of his progressive respiratory failure.
On the morning of [**2191-10-3**], pt died a peaceful death due to complications of progressive respiratory failure, likely secondary to lung cancer, pneumonia, COPD and an expanding malignant pleural effusion.
