The patient was discharged on the same day after the procedure and had some incisional pain for a few days postoperative.
One week postsurgery, the patient had sudden onset of left sided pleuritic chest pain with shortness of breath.
She was seen in the office the next day and was found also to have mildly elevated liver function tests.
She had a positive VQ scan with high probability for pulmonary embolism.
Ultrasound revealed mild dilatation of biliary ducts and right hydronephrosis.
CT scan showed marked dilation of intrahepatic biliary tree mostly on the right side with minimally dilated extrahepatic ducts.
The patient was started on Heparin drip for her pulmonary embolism and was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further evaluation and management.
Hypothyroidism [**2167-7-13**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation, the patient is pleasant and cooperative in mild distress.
The neck is supple, no jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular - regular rate and rhythm, split S1 and S2, no murmurs.
Lungs revealed decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally, clear to auscultation.
The abdomen reveals multiple healing trocar sites, soft, hyperactive bowel sounds, nondistended, mildly tender in the epigastric area.
Extremities are warm and well perfused, no edema, no tenderness.
The findings were previous cholecystectomy, total obstruction of right main hepatic duct due to surgical clips, normal pancreatic ducts.
There was also question of left sided colonic thickening.
A decision was made to quantify and minimize the risk of pulmonary embolism before proceeding with hepatic interventions.
On [**2167-10-23**], the patient had lower extremity LENI looking for deep vein thrombosis which was negative.
The patient had CTA which showed signs of resolving pulmonary embolism at the bilateral bases.
Abdominal CT showed dilated right sided ducts as well as thickening in the descending colon starting at the splenic flexure.
On hospital day three, the patient is afebrile and vital signs stable.
She continues to have mild epigastric pain.
