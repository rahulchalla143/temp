Admission Date:  [**2107-5-9**]       Discharge Date:  [**2107-6-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2043-12-24**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HEPATOBILIARY SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Briefly, this is a 63 year old male who has a history of metastatic rectal carcinoma who had been seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Location (un) 4121**] where he had a resection of his primary tumor as well as a liver resection.
He returns now to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2107-5-9**], for an elective caudate lobe resection for recurrence as well as radiofrequency ablation of the lateral segmental mass as well as insertion of an infusion pump into his hepatic artery.
rheumatic fever as a child and high cholesterol.
He has had cerebrovascular accidents in the past with multiple infarctions in his lacunar area.
The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2107-5-9**], where a caudate lobe resection, radiofrequency ablation of lateral segment mass and infusion pump procedure was performed.
The Acute Pain Service was consulted for management of his epidural.
The patient also has a colostomy from his primary rectal cancer resection.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   During his hospital course, as noted before, he had pulmonary respiratory desaturations on [**2107-5-11**], and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
His abdomen was soft and nontender.
He had multiple blood cultures drawn at that time for the respiratory difficulty which ended up being negative throughout.
The patient was having agitation at that time and continued to be monitored for this agitation.
He had a CT scan which ultimately showed no new infarctions or lesions.
It was felt that the confusion was secondary to the radiofrequency ablation and chemotherapy agents that were given, and he was continued to be monitored for this.
It was felt that while it could represent an infectious encephalopathy, it was more likely due to the toxic effects of his radiofrequency ablation.
He began having fevers on [**2107-5-14**], and there was a question of whether his wound was infected.
His white blood cell count continued to be elevated during this time, reaching a high of 37.5.
He was continued on his Unasyn for this elevated white count as well as his temperatures.
His confusion remained throughout his hospital course and on [**2107-5-15**], AmBisome was started for a question of Candidal infection.
On [**2107-5-18**], it was decided that he would be taken back to the Operating Room for a re-exploration and for removal of his infusion pump.
At the time of discharge, his white blood count was 14.0 and he had multiple blood cultures, port cultures and PICC line cultures, which were all negative for anything.
He also had an echocardiogram which revealed no vegetations on his valves and an Ophthalmology examination which was also negative for embolic events.
His [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains, which were placed at the time of the second operation, had slow output throughout his hospital course and were removed, the first one removed on postoperative day, [**5-31**], postoperative days number 22 and 13; and the second one being removed on postoperative day number 25 and 11 on [**6-3**].
The patient was kept on sitters until [**2107-5-29**], for agitation and for monitoring.
After that, he was able to be maintained without any sitters and was much more appropriate at that time.
On [**2107-5-26**], after multiple cultures were negative and no bacteria were discovered, the Zosyn was stopped and he was continued only on his [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**].
He was kept on morphine intermittently for pain control, Haldol for confusion, Lopressor, Protonix, and Regular insulin for his total parenteral nutrition.
The VAC drain put out low amounts and continued wound healing and was removed just prior to discharge to the rehabilitation facility.
Instructions were given for assessment of the wound upon arrival to the rehabilitation facility with the decision of whether wet-to-dry dressing or VAC dressing could be used.
Nutrition was also following and calorie counts were started on [**2107-5-31**].
Over the next three days, it was found that the patient was taking more and more of his nutritional requirements by mouth.
His wound was clean, dry and intact.
He continued to have an elevated respiratory rate up into the 20s and 30s, even at time of discharge, and a heart rate that was tachycardic to the low 100s; however, his O2 saturations were normal at 98% and the patient was able to ambulate and tolerate exercise.
The patient's pulmonary status was good, however,there was a small right pleural effusion noted on chest x-ray which was decreasing in size.
He did have some hematuria after the Foley insertion which he had noted before as in the past history, It fully resolved, however, the patient was incontinent of urine.
There was some slight fibrinous serous drainage from those [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] sites upon discharge, however, the output had decreased.
The wound itself was clean, dry and intact and granulating well when the VAC drain was removed.
His total parenteral nutrition had been stabilized for approximately two weeks prior to discharge with only minor modifications of electrolytes.
His creatinine was watched carefully for the long duration of his AmBisome treatment.
His morphine and Haldol were held due to somnolence and he was only treated intermittently with pain medications, specifically with dressing changes.
High cholesterol.
NOTE:  A copy of the patient's chart as well as copy of all radiologic reports and culture data will be included in his discharge packet.
If there are any questions, the receiving facility is instructed to contact myself or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further information.
