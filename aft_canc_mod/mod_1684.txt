Admission Date:  [**2145-3-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2145-3-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2082-8-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 31685**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from [**Hospital3 **] for EUS biopsy of GI mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: colonoscopy, endoscopy with fine needle aspiration of gastric mass   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 31686**] is a 62M with h/o CAD and 3-vessel CABG who presented to PCP for routine [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] and was noted to be pale with skin bruises on his right arm and left leg and was found to have a HCT of 21.
He underwent an EGD, which showed a polypoid submucosal mass in the gastric antrum which was biopsied.
A second EGD was performed on [**2145-3-8**], which showed blood in the stomach but no obvious source of bleeding.
There was some blood at the biopsy site.
There was no submucosal tissue available from the biopsy.
(Of note, in [**8-24**], the patient had a barium swallow for dysphagia that showed narrowing of the gastric antrum.
Additional work up included an MRI of the right upper extremity which showed complex multiseptated mass in the right medial arm measured 7.7 x 7.2 x 14.7 cm.
CT scan showed nodular pleural based thickening and a small pleural effusions right more than left.
Biopsy of the right upper extremity mass was not eprformed due to concern for compartment syndrome.
Serial Hcts were checked, and the patient was transfused 1U of PRBCs for a goal of >27 given the EGD results at the OSH which showed blood in the stomach.
He underwent various testing for further evaluation of his upper and lower extremity swelling including upper and lower extremity dopplers which were negative for DVT.
However, given the submucosal antral mass with biopsies from the [**Hospital1 **] unrevealing, the GI service was consulted for EUS guided biopsy, and the patient was transferred to the inpatient oncology service for further management.

Venous U/S [**2145-3-10**]: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right upper extremity.
Partially visualized large right upper extremity soft tissue hematoma.
Left Lower Extremity Venous U/S [**2145-3-10**]: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left lower extremity  CT COLONOGRAPHY [**2145-3-12**]: This exam is extremely limited due to the suboptimal bowel prep, poor insufflation of air due to sigmoid stricture.
There is a fixed stricture in the low mid abdomen at the curvature of the sigmoid colon due to the known tethering mass in the right lower quadrant.
No masses are seen within the transverse colon.
Within the right lower quadrant cecal area, there is a low-attenuation lesion which impinges on the cecum and this may represent loculated ascites or cystic collection associated with the right lower quadrant mass (4:56) - this could be further evaluated with an MRI.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45%).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate aortic regurgitation on a background of an apparently-normal valve.
Mild global left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mildly dilated aortic root.
Brief Hospital Course: 62M with newly discovered gastric mass and right upper extremity and left lower extremity hematomas discovered at an outside hospital.
He had a EGD for the purpose of EUS guided biopsy at [**Hospital1 18**] however no biopsy taken given patient's unclear coagulopathy.
A CTA/CTV here demonstrated a non-invasive submucosal mass.
Bone marrow biopsy was done to rule out lymphoma and was negative for hematologic malignancy.
General surgery was following and did not want to pursue biopsy given bleeding diathesis.
# Right lower quadrant mass:  CT showed a vaguely defined soft tissue mass in the right lower quadrant with extensive tethering of small bowel loops.
Colonoscopy done for further evaluation was suboptimal because of partial stricture in the sigmoid.
Virtual colonoscopy done for follow-up was also a less than ideal study but was suggestive of a fluid collection near the mass.
# Right Upper Extremity Mass vs Hematoma: Patient had MRI of RUE at OSH that showed a possible mass versus hematoma.
Work-up of coagulopathy including PT/PTT, platelets, euglobulin lysis time, platelet activator inhibitor activity, plasminogen activator, were normal.
# Shrunken Liver/Splenomegaly: These symptoms coupled with finding of gastric varices of EGD were suggestive of chronic liver disease.
Given patient's history of being overweight it is possible that he developed NASH.
He was negative for Hep B and Hep C as well as AMA, [**Doctor First Name **].
# Heart murmur:  The patient developed a squeaking early diastolic murmur.
Given that the murmur was new/changed, a repeat echo was done which confirmed aortic insufficiency with no other significant changes.
# Bilateral pleural effusions: Seen on admission CT.
He does have a known coronary history and is status post bypass surgery though no known history of heart failure.
# CAD: ASA and Plavix were held given the apparent bleeding diathesis.
Please call your doctor or return to the ED if you develop bleeding, chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers and chills, or other symptoms that are concerning to you.
