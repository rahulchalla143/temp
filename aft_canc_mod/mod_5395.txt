Small right pleural effusion persists.
No pneumothorax.
ECHO [**7-4**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

Mild to moderate ([**2-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.

[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course: started on Vanco and Zosyn Extubated on [**7-4**] with no further resp distress Pressors weaned off on day of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission Grew VRE in [**5-21**] blood cultures, Pseudomonas and MRSA in sputum -> changed to Linezolid and Zosyn PICC pulled TTE showed no vegetations Episodes RVR -> Metoprolol titrate up to 75 [**Hospital1 **] .
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial, aspiration event vs mucus plug / secretions.
Lung function compromised by recent MRSA PNA + Pseudomonal superinfection contributing.
- O2 as needed, weaned to room air on the floor - Continued Zosyn for Pseudomonas for 14 day course, [**Date range (1) 66813**] - frequent suctioning, pulmonary toilet, CPT - Midline placed [**7-8**] for the rest of Zosyn course .
- d/ced PICC and sent tip for Cx [**7-4**] -> cx NTD - line holiday over the weekend -> placed midline [**7-8**] for the rest of Zosyn course (see above) - continued Linezolid for 2 weeks, [**Date range (1) 34961**] .
Has tried Amio in past but recently d/c'd [**3-21**] concerns for side effects given hx of restrictive lung disease.
# CAD: stable without active ischemia.
# H/O GIB: In setting of supratherapeutic INR.
# Parkinson Dz: c/b chronic aspiration.
# FEN: continued TFs .
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 38**] Landing  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: 1) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure with intubation, secondary to aspiration, MRSA and Pseudomonal pneumonia 2) VRE Bacteremia presumed from PICC Line infection  Secondary: 3) Parkinson's disease with chronic aspiration, s/p G-tube placement 4) dementia 5) delirium 6) Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response 7) CAD s/p CABG in [**2157**] 8) Restrictive lung disease [**3-21**] to asbestos exposure 9) Hypertension 10) Hyperlipidemia 11) myelodysplasia 12) B12 deficiency 13) BPH   Discharge Condition: Improved- breathing comfortably on room air, afebrile for several days Still with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, confused with hypophonia attributed to recent intubation.
Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor or go to the ER if you have any fevers, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, confusion, pain with urination, or any other symptoms that concern you.
Followup Instructions: 1) Weekly CBC and LFTs while on linezolid 2) repeat LFTs in one month (mild transaminitis here) 3) Check Thyroid function tests in 1 month 4) condsider head CT if delirium fails to resolve over the next week as the pneumonia and bacteremia/septicema are treated 5) titrate up beta blocker as needed for HR control, to achieve HR less than 100 beats per minute at the minimum.
Avoid amiodarone given history of chronic lung disease.
