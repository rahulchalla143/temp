Imaging: [**2161-1-28**] - Chest X-Ray, PA and lateral: At the margin of confluent perihilar opacification, left greater than right, is interstitial abnormality or lymphatic engorgement.
There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
There is no free air under the diaphragm.
- CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: Confluent ground-glass opacities are noted at the lung bases, right greater than left, with relative subpleural sparing.
There are no pleural effusions.
The heart is normal in size, with a trace pericardial effusion.
Small nodules in the left lateral breast probably represent intramammary lymph nodes.
ABDOMEN: There is borderline fatty infiltration of the liver and the spleen is mildly enlarged, measuring 14.7 cm in length.
Multiple enlarged celiac and periportal lymph nodes are present.
These are non-specific but frequently accompany hepatitis C infection.
A number of mildly enlarge paraesphageal nodes are present.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast promptly and symmetrically, without masses or hydronephrosis.
Multiple bilateral renal hypodensities are too small to characterize, but likely represent cysts.
There is a fibroid uterus, with exophytic component extending from the right fundus measuring 5.6 x 3.7 cm.
In addition, there are fluid attenuation adnexal cysts measuring 6 x 5.6 cm on the left and 1.7 x 1.3 cm on the right.
Trace free fluid is present in the pelvis.
There is no free intraperitoneal air.
Scattered calcifications are noted in the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries, with patent branch vessels.
Multiple prominent lymph nodes measure up to 10 mm in the retroperitoneum and 5 mm in the mesentery.
A large left inguinal lymph node measures 13 mm, and is likely reactive.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are identified.
Bibasilar ground glass opacities, compatible with bronchpneumonia; ground glass opacities are not specific, however, and could be seen with other causes such as aspiration or hemorrhage.
Small left lateral breast nodules suggesting intramammary lymph nodes of normal size; correlation with mammography is recommended.
- PELVIS U.S., TRANSVAGINAL: Transabdominal ultrasound was initially performed and demonstrates a Nabothian cyst.
Within it is a well- circumscribed anechoic structure which measures 2.0 x 1.9 x 1.8 cm, consistent with a simple cyst.
The right ovary demonstrates normal arterial and venous waveforms.
The left ovary contains a 5.4 x 4.6 x 4.8 cm well-circumscribed hypoechoic lesion containing echogenic material with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] pattern, compatible with a hemorrhagic cyst.
The left ovary demonstrates normal- appearing arterial and venous waveforms.
No free fluid is seen.
[**2161-1-29**] - CXR Portable: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a further progression of disease.
The pre-existing opacities on the left are unchanged in size and severity.
No other changes.
- Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a mass on the tricuspid valve.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: there is a small (0.4cm) calcified mass on the tricuspid valve (probably anterior leaflet).
This could be simple calcification or a healed vegetation.
There is moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
The right ventricle appears dilated and is probably hypokinetic given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.
At least mild pulmonary artery hypertension.
A large amount of formed stool is seen throughout the colon.
There is no free intraperitoneal air.
Small-bowel obstruction with fluid-filled loops cannot be excluded.
If there is high clinical concern for obstruction, CT is the next appropriate imaging step  Brief Hospital Course: 43 yo F with HIV, Hepatitis C and history of substance abuse presented with LLQ pain and fever to 101.3, cough, diffuse myalgias.
# Pnuemonia, likely atypical pneumonia.
Patient's initial presentation with acute onset of fever, cough, myalgia and malaise with interstitial infiltrate on CXR is concerning for atypical pneumonia.
Laboratory studies did not reveal any specific pathogen for the pneumonia, but she was started on Levaquin and Flagyl initially.
A code blue was called at 10:15AM on [**1-28**] for respiratory distress.
She was very anxious and respiratory distress improved.
She was transferred to the MICU for observation given continued respiratory distress.
Pt's serial ABGs showed progressively worsening hypoxia and hypercarbia (7.34/49/76 -> 7.34/51/55) and she was unable to tolerate BiPAP due to extreme anxiety (which did improve her oxygenation to O2 sats of 99%) so she was intubated in the ICU.
# Hypoxic Respiratory failure, likely component of pneumonia and anxiety.
# Abdominal/Back pain.
She initially reports intermittent left lower abdominal pain and diffuse upper buttocks pain which started during the latter half of her menses.
Fibroid uterus and adnexal cysts were seen on CT scan so pelvic ultrasound was obtained which showed right simple ovarian cyst and left hemorrhagic ovarian cyst.
Pain improved with ibuprofen.
# HYPONATREMIA - Patient had mild hyponatremia on Day 1.
Given her poor PO intake and her febrile state before admission, she most likely has hypovolemic hyponatremia.
# Hepatitis C.  Her viral load was 6.1 million copies in 12/[**2160**].
CT abdomen showed borderline fatty infiltrate and mild splenomegaly, raising concern for portal hypertension, although splenomegaly could be reactive given recent illness.
# Left lateral breast nodule.
This was noted on CT scan for concern of intra-mammary lymph node.
Patient was advised to have a follow-up breast exam and mammography  # Left ovarian hemorrhagic cyst, incidental finding.
# Anxiety.
She was not discharged on any benzodiazepam as it was not part of her regimen and as there is interaction with suboxone.
# Substance abuse.
There was no signs or symptoms of withdrawal while patient was in the hospital.
She was transitioned to short acting oxycodone and then later back to suboxone 8 mg daily on day of discharge without issue.
Because of special licensing issue, no suboxone was prescribed to the patient upon discharge.
# Constipation, likely secondary to significant amount of narcotic use while intubated in the MICU.
She continued to breath out of synchrony with the ventilator, so cistracurium was administered.
As her respiratory status improved, she was extubated and transitioned to methadone as maintenance given her history of substance abuse.
The significant narcotic use caused severe constipation with symptoms of nausea and vomiting, confirmed with physical exam, and abdominal X-ray.
# Bipolar disease.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: - community-acquired pneumonia  Secondary diagnosis - HIV - Hepatitis C - Left lateral breast nodule - Left ovarian hemorrhagic cyst - Uterine fibroid - bipolar disorder   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to the hospital with weakness, fevers and abdominal pain.
A CXR showed signs of likely pneumonia which we treated with antibiotics.
The ovarian cyst will need to be evaluated further with ultrasound in the following weeks.
On the CT imaging, a small left breast nodule was noted.
You should also have your HIV and hepatitis C monitored closely.
