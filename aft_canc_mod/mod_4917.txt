Admission Date:  [**2186-3-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2186-3-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2118-6-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Dilantin Kapseal / Calcipotriene / Lorazepam  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5141**] Chief Complaint: syncope and pleuritic chest pain upon waking  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 67 year old female with epilepsy, hypertension, and pancreatic cancer s/p Whipple with positive margin who is currently undergoing chemotherapy and radiation.
She had a syncopal episode after returning home from a radiotherapy session today and was initially seen at an OSH where she was diagnosed with bilateral PEs.
After returning home from her radiotherapy session today, she had a syncopal episode as she was entering her home.
She reports that it was very different than prior seizures and there was no evidence of seizure activity.
After waking, she felt SOB with new bilateral chest and back pain on inspiration.
While there, she was tachy to the 140s with BP in the 80s-90s, and CTA showed bilateral PEs and evidence of right heart strain.
She complained of continued pleuritic chest pain and back pain worse with inspiration.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 113 bpm and slight ST depressions in the lateral leads, as well as a mild S1Q3T3 pattern.
She was given Acetaminophen 1000 mg, which she reports helped the pain significantly.
Once in the ICU, she reported feeling much better than earlier, but with some continued pleuritic chest pain.
She reports having a long history of varicose veins, but noted a recent palpable vessel on her medial right thigh near the knee which worsened and then improved a few days ago.
She has chronic LE edema and venous stasis changes.
She has lost about 50 lbs since her diagnosis with pancreatic cancer.
She has chronic nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea related to her chemotherapy and radiation.
Past Medical History: # Pancreatic Cancer -- as below # Epilepsy -- (Neurologist Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in [**Hospital1 1474**] MA) -- No seizure in about 5 years # Psoriasis # Basal cell carcinoma of the skin, status post excision # Hypertension -- now resolved # Tonsillectomy History .
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: # Pancreatic Cancer -- stage IIB (pT3, pN1, M0) -- Summer [**2184**] developed epigastric discomfort -- Few months later obstructive jaundice -- [**2185-11-21**]: CT scan at [**Hospital1 18**] showed mass in the pancreatic uncinate process -- [**2185-12-8**]: Whipple procedure with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] -- Pathology showed a 2.4-cm moderately differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma in the head of the pancreas.
One of the 11 lymph nodes examined was positive, although it was noticed that the single lymph node that contained carcinoma appeared to be involved by direct contiguous tumor growth.
The primary tumor was extending beyond the pancreas, but without involvement of the celiac axis or superior mesenteric artery.
The uncinate process margin was positive for carcinoma.
There was no vascular or lymphatic invasion but there was extensive perineural invasion.
-- [**2186-2-22**]: Xeloda held due to GI toxicity.
She reports that the son and grandson of her mother's sister died from pancreatic cancer, but no more immediate family members.
# Mother -- Died at age 89 of leukemia and had a history of CHF.
Sclera anicteric.
No cervical lymphadenopathy.
No wheezes or rhonchi.
No organomegaly or masses.
Well healed transverse surgical incision across upper abdomen.
LE edema 1+ bilaterally.
Palpable cord right medial thigh proximal to knee.
No calf tenderness.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
CONCLUSIONS: Small underfilled hyperdynamic left ventricle.
Right ventricular systolic dysfunction with relative preservation of the right ventricular apex consistent with acute RV strain in the setting of her known PE.
Likely severe pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
Superficial thrombophlebitis of the right great saphenous vein.
No DVT in the left lower extremity.
ABDOMINAL U/S [**2186-3-16**]: FINDINGS: The liver is normal in echotexture, without focal lesions.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
There is no intra-abdominal free fluid.
No evidence for portal vein thrombosis.
The aorta is mildly tortuous.
IMPRESSION: No active pulmonary disease.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 67 year old female with epilepsy, hypertension, and pancreatic cancer s/p Whipple with positive margin who is currently undergoing chemotherapy and radiation.
She presented to OSH with syncope from bilateral PEs and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
# Pulmonary Embolism: She presented with syncope and then had classic signs of PE including rapid onset SOB, pleurisy, and tachycardia.
She was at high risk given her pancreatic cancer and ongoing treatments.
- Found to have bilateral PEs on CTA at the OSH and was started on a Heparin drip.
- Thrombolysis was considered given her initial low BP (80-90?????
?s), low UOP (10-20cc/hr), and echo showing right heart strain.
- Her LE dopplers showed DVT involving the right peroneal vein and superficial thrombophlebitis of the right great saphenous vein.
- Once the patient was transferred to the floor on [**3-19**], she was foudn to be hemodynamically stable with no episodes of oxygen desaturation, pleurisy, or tachycardia .
# Atrial Fibrillation: She had an episode of AFib with HR in the 140s overnight [**Date range (1) 88312**], but was asymptomatic and her BP remained fairly stable.
- Her stools were guaiac positive and a mild GI bleed was suspected given her treatment with Heparin - She did not show any evidence of upper or lower GI bleeding once transferred to the floor, and her hematocrit rose back up to 30.5 on DOD - Her hematocrit will be followed closely on her anticoagulation treatment and any potential cessation of treatment or intervention will be avoided while she is still in the subacute phase of PE treatment  # Epilepsy: She has a history of epilepsy treated with Carbamazepine and Levetiracetam, so we continued Carbamazepine 200 mg PO TID and Levetiracetam 500 mg PO Q6H per her home dosing regimen.
# Pancreatic Cancer:  She has pancreatic adenocarcinoma stage IIB and is s/p Whipple procedure with positive margins on [**2185-12-6**].
She was started on Dexamethasone [**2186-2-22**] for nausea relief and improved appetite.
She has had chronic nausea and diarrhea after her surgery and with her ongoing treatments.
We continued pancreatic enzyme supplements with meals, and continued lorazepam 0.5mg PO Q6H PRN anxiety or nausea.
Medications on Admission: Carbamazepine 200 mg PO TID Levetiracetam 500 mg PO Q6H Dexamethasone 2 mg PO daily Lipase-protease-amylase [Zenpep] (20,000-68,000-109,000 units) -- Take 3 capsules PO with meals and 2 capsules PO with snacks Pantoprazole 40 mg PO daily Potassium chloride 10 mEq PO BID Lorazepam 0.5 mg PO Q6H PRN anxiety or nausea   Discharge Medications: 1. enoxaparin 80 mg/0.8 mL Syringe Sig: Seventy (70) mg Subcutaneous twice a day.

Because of your blood clots, you had evidence of strain on your heart.
This also likely caused your heart to go into an irregular rhythm called atrial fibrillation.
