Nonspecific hypodensities at the dome of the right lobe are noted.
Given possible underlying cirrhosis, these should be evaluated with MRI nonemergently to exclude malignancy.
Large stone in the gallbladder, as well as air seen within the common duct and gallbladder neck.
If there is no history of prior sphincterotomy, this is concerning for biliary-enteric fistula.
Possible fistulous connection is identified on coronal images (300b:22-23).
Diffuse dilation of fluid-filled proximal small bowel measuring nearly 4 cm, with relative collapse of the terminal ileum and distal ileum.
This is suggestive of early versus partial small-bowel obstruction, though no definite transition point is identified.
Consolidation at the right lung base, likely atelectasis or aspiration.
However, followup imaging following resolution of acute illness to exclude underlying lesion is recommended.
IVC filter is identified in adequate position.
Delayed contrast excretion by the kidneys bilaterally, compatible with known renal failure.
No evidence of global cerebral edema.
Persistent 2 mm hyperdense focus in the left frontal lobe at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction, which may represent a cavernoma, or a tiny focus of acute hemorrhage which could be related to a small mass.
In the absence of associated focal edema, a septic embolus is less likely.
Large left parietal extraaxial mass, presumably a meningioma, with calvarial irregularity, as before.
MRI with and without contrast would be helpful to assess for osseous invasion and other aggressive features.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%).
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
cholangiogram [**5-30**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence for fistulous communication between the biliary system and bowel.
There is a large stone within the gallbladder.
The cystic duct, and intrahepatic ducts are not dilated.

His initial presentation was concerning for fulminant hepatic failure and transplant workup was initiated.
However, INR of 20 improved dramatically with vitamin K and was felt to be secondary to coumadin.
He also had CT which showed acute calculous cholecystitis and is s/p percutaneous cholecystostomy.
# cholecystits with ecoli bacteremia he will continue cipro flagyl until surgery.
**  # hyperbilirubinemia abscence of biliary dilation or obstruction and size of gallstone fits with Mirizzi syndrome.
He may also have had an element of cholestasis of sepsis.
**We have recommended to the surgeons a liver biopsy at time of cholecystectomy to rule out intrinsic disease.
**  # Acute renal failure Creatinine 7.3 on admission and BUN 251.
**  # Acute blood loss anemia With reported melena on admission.
# Paroxysmal Afib with rapid ventricular rate This occurred while patient critically ill in ICU and responded only to amiodarone.
Patient was on metoprolol at home but no reported history of atrial fibrillation.
On the floor, amiodarone discontinued for concern for toxicity and suspicion that atrial fibrillation was provoked by illness, fluid status.
# h/o Pulmonary Embolism with RH strain dx [**11/2158**] with bilateral DVTs Patient was on coumadin and with IVC filter.
After endoscopy, we elected to restart anticoagulation with lovenox as will be going to surgery but felt to be high risk for embolism as sedentary and with wegeners.
# Altered mental status Was likely uremia with BUN 251 and not hepatic encephalopathy.
# Meningioma and h/o seizures Scans reviewed by neurosurgery, felt no bleeding or significant acute process.
Note that dilantin levels subtherapeutic but patient on two agents and therapeutic dose of keprra and has not had seizures on this regimen.
# Gout: flare likely in setting of uremia and dehydration.
# h/o Wegeners: No evidence of white cell casts, acanthocytes, red cell casts that would suggest flare of Wegeners  MEDICATION CHANGES AND RECOMMENDATIONS 1. ciprofloxacin and metronidazole until surgery 2. colchicine every other day for gout 3. lovenox until surgery then reevaluate 4. restart aspirin 81 when creatinine < 1.3 but hold one week prior to surgery 5. holding lasix and HCTZ as creatinine not at baseline and not hypertensive or edematous.
if hypertensive would consider adding back 10. restart simvastatin when LFTs normalized   Medications on Admission: Tramadol-Acetaminophen 37.5mg-325mg 1-2 tablets q12h prn (disp # 50 on [**2159-4-13**]) Prednisone 5mg increased to 40mg daily on [**2159-5-21**] Phytonadione 5mg ONCE [**2159-5-21**] Diazepam 5mg prn (disp # 10 on [**2159-1-22**]) Cetirizine 10 mg daily Asa 81 mg daily Calcitriol 0.25 mcg po daily Allopurinol 150 mg po daiily Folic acid 1 mg po daily Synthroid 50 mcg po qam Lasix 160mg qam and 80 mg qam Keppra 1 gram po bid Toprol XL 300 mg po daily Phenytoin 200 mg po bid Simvastatin 40 mg po qhs Ferrous Sulfate 325 mg po daily Coumadin 5 mg po daily (held starting [**2159-5-21**]) Irbesartan 150 mg po daily KCl 40 MEq po bid HCTZ 25 mg po daily Colchicine 0.6 mg po daily Tramadol Diphenhydramine Multivitamin Omega 3 Fatty Acids Vitamin B 12 Vitamin B6 Coenzyme Q Nasonex  Discharge Medications: 1.

You were admitted with a severe infection in your gall bladder.
The surgeons places a plastic tube to drain the infected bile and we treated you with antibiotics.
Please suggest that Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2253**] schedule you to see a cardiologist for the abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.
