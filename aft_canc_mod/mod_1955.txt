But try not to exert to much pressure on the amputation site when transferring and or pivoting.
A dressing may cover your amputation site and this should be left in place for three (3) days.
You will be given a new [**Location (un) 16615**] for pain medication, which can be taken every three (3) to four (4) hours only if necessary.
Remember that narcotic pain meds can be constipating and you should increase the fluid and bulk foods in your diet.
(Check with your physician if you have fluid restrictions.)
Eat small balanced meals throughout the day.
There are no special restrictions on your diet postoperatively.
For people with vascular problems we would recommend a cholesterol lowering diet: Follow a diet low in total fat and low in saturated fat and in cholesterol to improve lipid profile in your blood.
If you have diabetes and would like additional guidance, you may request a referral from your doctor.
