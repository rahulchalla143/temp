CT Head without contrast ([**2107-6-26**]): No acute intracranial process.
Mild right sphenoidal sinus disease.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild anterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 37 year old female with past medical history of FSH producing macroadenoma s/p TSS x 2 complicated by panhypopituitarism for which she is on chronic prednisone and levothyroxine admitted with hypotension, hypoglycemia, hypothermia and bradycardia likely due to adrenal crisis.
She was empirically started on Vancomcyin/Zosyn to cover for bacterial infection precipitating adrenal crisis but they were discontinued on day 3 as blood cultures were negative x 48 hours and no source of infection noted on imaging and exam.
TTE, EKG and cardiac enzymes did not reveal any cardiac pathology.
Hypernatremia: Likely due to central diabetes insipidus.
Panhypoptituitarism s/p TSS x 2 for pituitary macroadenoma.
Prolong QTc: Likely due to sinus bradycardia in setting of electrolyte imbalance.
Defer to primary endocrinologist regarding imaging to determine there are any signs of growth of her adenoma  6.
Patient reports not being depressed or having ahedonia.
Anemia: Iron studies showing anemia of chronic disease with concaminant iron deficiency anemia.
Hyperglycemia: Likely due to increased steroids.
Adrenal crisis 2.
Central diabetes insipidus  Secondary Diagnosis 1.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after being found at home with low blood pressure, low blood glucose and low heart rate thought to be due to adrenal crisis.
You were also noted to have high sodium levels which were thought to be due to deficiency in another pituitary hormone called vasopression.
You were also started on iron as you were thought to be iron deficient causing you to have low blood count.
FOLLOWING MEDICATION CHANGES WERE MADE TO YOUR MEDICAL REGIMEN START Desmopressin 0.1 mg by mouth every night to help with your sodium level and urinate less water START IRON 325 mg by mouth once a day to help with your blood count INCREASE PREDNISONE to 20 mg by mouth every day until you see Dr.  [**Last Name (STitle) **]  Please discuss with your endocrinologist regarding further imaging of your brain with MRI to determine whether your pituitary adenoma is increasing in size.
