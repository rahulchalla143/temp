The patient lives in [**Location **], and she was recently hospitalized there from mid [**Month (only) **] until [**8-31**] for management of a GI bleed.
Given her low platelets, the GI team was unable to cauterize her AVMs.
Since she has been in [**Location (un) 86**], she has continued to have some rectal bleeding.
Colonoscopy disclosed diverticulosis of the colon, grade 3 internal hemorrhoids, and melena in the cecum and ascending colon.
EGD disclosed a site of active bleeding in the fourth portion of the doudenum.
During the procedure, no active bleeding was visualized.
Past Medical History: 1) CAD s/p 3 vessel CABG  2) CHF  3) Osteoarthritis  4) High cholesterol  5) Hypothyroidism  6) HTN  7) Heart murmurs since age 10, when she was diagnosed with scarlet fever and diptheria.
Bone marrow biopsy was consistent with MDS and refractory anemia with excess blasts.
No petechiae.
No cervical lymphadenopathy.
No carotid bruits.
No rales, wheezes, or crackles.
III/VI systolic murmur at LUSB, radiating to carotids.
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum and jejunum.
-Epinephrine injected into region of severe gastritis.
GI bleeding - On day of admission, pt underwent EGD with hemoclip placement on bledding AVM in 4th portion of duodenum and embolization of gastroduodenal artery.
In addition to these episodes of melena, pt was likely experiencing continuous GI bleeding as BUN was elevated from baseline of 0.8 to 1.3-1.8 during most of hospital course.
Following 2 episodes of melena on [**9-15**], patient underwent a Bleeding Study which revealed a faint area of increased tracer accumulation in LUQ that was possibly related to a slow bleed at 3rd-4th portion of duodenum.
Following melena on [**9-17**], pt underwent repeat EGD, during which a hemorrhagic AVM in the proximal jejunum was identified and an endoclip was placed; additionally, severe gastritis was observed and 7cc of epinephrine was injected into the most severe region.
Following this procedure, the patient recevied 2 units of pRBCs and has had no further melena; HCT has been stable at > 29.8.
MDS - Mr. [**Known lastname 58415**] has a lifelong Hx of anemia w/ superimposed MDS and refractory anemia and thrombocytopenia with excess blast type II (11% blasts and trisomy 8).
At admission, in addition to her GI bleeding, she was having intermittent, persistent bleeding from her nasal mucosa.
In hospital, PLT goal was > 20 due to ongoing bleeding and HCT goal was > 25 given CAD.
Danazol can cause fluid retention, sun-sensitivity and fluctations in glucose levels; therefore, Given Hx of cardiac disease, she needs close following for fluid overload.
Cardiac: EKG at admission: Sinus bradycardia with nonspecific lateral ST-T changes w/ no previous tracing for comparison.
Large pulse pressure differential.
This may have been due to increased amnt intra-luminal bleeding.
)PUML: CXR at admission: well placed L PICC with L lung base atelectasis.
Patient remained afebrile throughout course with Tmax=99.6 and no antibiotics were given.
Severe gastritis was observed on EGD and H. pylori serology was +.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - Acute Rehab  Discharge Diagnosis: -Gastrointestinal bleeding -Duodenal and jejunal arterio-venous malformations.
-CAD, s/p 3 v. CABG -osteoarthritis -Mylodysplastic syndrome (MDS): associated with anemia and thrombocytopenia -hypercholesterolemia   Discharge Condition: stable  Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor if you have any further bleeding from your rectum, chest pain, lightheadedness, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers or chills.
