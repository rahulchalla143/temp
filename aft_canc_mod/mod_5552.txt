Admission Date:  [**2111-10-5**]     Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2044-11-13**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Acute shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66-year-old woman with a past medical history significant for breast cancer diagnosed in [**2111-5-29**].
She is status post resection and chemotherapy and undergoing XRT currently, having completed session #6 out of 25 planned, who presents with acute shortness of breath.
This a.m. the patient woke up at approximately 4 a.m., went to the bathroom and felt acutely short of breath.
The patient has felt short of breath previously over the last few weeks, but this was different.
Her recent shortness of breath was believed to be secondary to some anemia associated with the chemotherapy and the overall weakness brought about by the chemotherapy.
However, at 4 a.m. this morning the patient was short of breath, felt tachycardic, she took her own pulse and was jittery and these symptoms did not resolve when she sat down.
In the Emergency Room as part of the work-up, the patient received a VQ scan which was markedly positive for a pulmonary embolus showing no perfusion of the entire left lung and of the right lower lobe.
Possible interventions being considered in the Emergency Room were thrombolysis or possible thrombectomy and the patient was admitted to the medical ICU for initiation of either of these treatments and subsequent care.
Of note, the patient denies any trauma to her lower legs or any recent immobility, although she does report she has not been very energetic over the past few weeks.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast, status post resection in [**2111-4-28**] and chemotherapy, Adriamycin and Cytoxan with four cycles, the last cycle ended [**9-11**].
2) Newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus this past Summer.
4) Coronary artery disease with a question CHF from diastolic dysfunction with a normal EF on echo pre chemotherapy in [**2111-5-29**].
The patient's history is remarkable for a sister with lung cancer in her 60's.
In general, the patient is a mildly obese African American female in moderate to severe respiratory distress, talking in [**4-2**] word phrases and becoming increasingly short of breath with increased respiratory rate while speaking.
Neck exam, JVD approximately 9-10 cm above the sternal notch and it was bounding.
She had no lymphadenopathy.
There were no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
Extremities, she had no edema.
There were no palpable cords.
On the red blood cells her RDW was 18, her MCV was 75, there was 2+ hypochromia and 2+ anisocytosis and 3+ microcytosis with 1+ poikilocytosis.
Her urinalysis had a specific gravity of 1.013, there was no blood, nitrites, protein or glucose.
There were no red blood cells, there were 33 white blood cells with few bacteria and 9 epithelial cells.
Chest x-ray, enlarged heart, perivascular haziness right greater than left, likely asymmetric CHF.
There was no pneumonia, no effusions, no pneumothorax.
There were decreased vascular markings left compared with right.
There as no mass or shift, mild cerebral atrophy.
CT head with contrast, unofficial read showed an 8 mm basilar tip aneurysm on the left.
VQ scan showed decreased ventilation to the right lung diffusely, abnormal perfusion to the left lung and right lower lobe.
EKG showed supraventricular tachycardia at a rate of 164.
There was an S in lead 1, a Q in lead 3 and an inverted T wave in lead 3.
There were also inverted T waves laterally consistent with RV strain.
IMPRESSION on admission is a 67-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of breast cancer who presents with acute shortness of breath.
The VQ scan is high likelihood for a massive pulmonary embolus which correlates with the patient's clinical findings of tachycardia, shortness of breath, tachypnea, hypotension and JVD.
The patient also has a family history of clot which may contribute to the formation of DVT leading to a PE.
Neurologically the CT with contrast showed no metastatic disease in the brain, however, an 8 mm aneurysm at the left basilar tip was shown.
Consult with the stroke team to assess for risk of rupture if the patient was given TPA.
The patient was tachypneic and hypotensive.
From an ID perspective, the patient had a dirty urinalysis with numerous white cells.
From an endocrine point of view the patient is diabetic and hypothyroid.
