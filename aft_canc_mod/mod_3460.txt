Admission Date:  [**2161-11-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2161-11-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2128-4-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Iodine; Iodine Containing / Zofran  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 492**] Chief Complaint: weakness, confusion   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: paracentesis  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 73200**] is a 33 year old female with end stage metastatic melanoma admitted for weakness and confusion/somnolence.
Patient has had slowly declining functional status over the past few weeks and has been more somnolent and dozing off during conversations.
Today, she presented to [**Hospital 5871**] Hospital for confusion and weakness.
At [**Location (un) 5871**], she was noted to be tachycardia and to have a positive UA, so was given vancomycin and Zosyn.
She was given 3LNS for dehydration and ARF.
She underwent V/Q scan for workup of tachycardia, shortness of breath, and metastatic melanoma which was found to be low prob.
Bilateral LENIs were also negative.
She got a CT abd/pelvis which showed new significant ascites from [**2161-8-7**].
CXR showed low lung volumes, but lung cuts on abdomen CT showed moderate plerula effusions with atelectasis.
Labs were notable for acute renal failure and newly elevated LFTs.
Upon arrival to the floor, patient denies shortness of breath, though is speaking in short sentences.
Patient reports lightheadedness and thirstiness over the past few days.
Patient was diagnosed with melanoma 2 years ago when she noted an enlarging groin node found to be positive for metastatic melanoma.
Patient underwent lymphadenectomy and was found to have positive inguinal, pelvic, ileac, and peri-aortic nodes.
She began IL-2 chemotherapy in [**8-13**] with disease progression.
She is now being treated by NIH Surgery Branch for adoptive cellular immunotherapy.
She does have an occasional glass of wine or beer.
Physical Exam: Gen: cachectic, tachypneic HEENT: temporal wasting, o/p clear CV: Tachycardic, no m/r/g Pulm: diminished breath sounds at bases bilaterally Abd: soft, NT, distended, + fluid wave, bowel sounds present Ext: 2+ bilateral pitting edema Neuro: somnolent, falling asleep mid-sentence  Pertinent Results: Admission Labs: .
no DVT of right or left leg.
IMPRESSION: Extremely limited examination secondary to lack of intravenous and oral contrast and extensive intra-abdominal pelvic ascites.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Large volume of intra-abdominal and pelvic ascites.
Right-sided double-J ureteral stent with moderate associated hydronephrosis.
No CT findings suggestive of bowel obstruction or perforation.
Persistent moderate hydronephrosis of the right kidney and right hydroureter suggestive of stent malfunction.
Thick-walled bladder with sediment identified in the posterior aspect.
Increased echogenicity of the kidneys bilaterally with an appearance suggestive of medullary nephrocalcinosis.
No ST elevations or depressions.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Ms.  [**Known lastname 73200**] is a 33 year old female with metastatic melanoma admitted with somnolence, liver failure, renal failure, new chylous ascites and persistent tachycardia of unclear etiology, who ultimately was made comfort measures only and passed away on a morphine drip with family at bedside.
Patient admitted with symptoms of fatigue and somnolence which appeared to me multifactorial.
Patient was hydrated for dehydration.
Patient was taking standing opioids at home and presented with renal and liver failure, so impaired clearance of toxins and meds likely contributed to her mental status.
Detrol, compazine, and opiods (initially) were withheld and mental status mildly improved.
Patient did not report subjective shortness of breath on admission, but appeared tachypneic and had new oxygen requirement of 4LNC.
Patient noted to have new significant ascites with bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis which may have contributed.
VQ scan was low prob for PE, though echo shows increased TR gradient and pulmonary artery pressures.
No evidence of pneumonia.
Patient did not have significant relief of tachypnea with therapeutic paracentesis.
Urology evaluated the stent who felt it was working well, though CT abd/pelvis showed persistent hydronephrosis suggesting the possibility of stent malfuction.
Patient had mild ascites in [**8-14**], and was admitted with significant worsening of ascites over two months.
No history of cirrhosis, though patient has been receiving various chemotherapies (though exact medications unclear).
SAAG suggestive of exudative secondary to malignancy.
Diagnostic para consistent with chylous ascites, likely due to infiltration of melanoma into lymphatics.
Elevated LFTs.
Noted to have newly elevated LFTs, likely secondary to liver infiltration of lymphatics.
New thrombocytopenia in setting of elevated LFTs and worsening ascites were though to possibly be due to liver failure.
She was noted to have mild splenomegaly on abdominal ultrasound.
Also concern for DIC or TTP-HUS, though DIC labs were normal.
Renal failure.
Patient recently had right sided ureteral stent placed and presented with elevated Cr of 1.3 that did not respond to > 5 L of IVF.
Moderate hydronephrosis noted on abodinal CT suggestive of a non-functioning stent, though urology evaluated the patietn and felt it was working but recommended further imaging studies.
Patient has end stage metastatic melanoma and failed multiple chemotherapy regimens.
However, patient's presentation suggested worsening disease with multiorgan failure and no reversible etiology.
