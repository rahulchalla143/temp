Renal biopsy   History of Present Illness: 49 yo M with a history of ESRD, secondary to kidney transplant failure who was transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for suspected TTP-HUS.
The patient reports that he has had six months of increasing shortness of breath, fatigue and intermittent blood-tinged productive cough.
The shortness of breath has become acutely worse over the last few days and he has had symptoms of orthopnea.
The patient presented to the OSH and was noted to have bilateral pleural effusions on chest CT, Hct 20.5, K 7.8 Cr 4.2 and glucose > 400.
Hematology was consulted and felt that he needed plasmapheresis for hemolytic uremic syndrome.
ROS: unable to obtain complete review, but denied CP or fevers   Past Medical History: 1.
L cadavaric kidney transplant ([**2152**]) for renal failure [**1-31**] presumed chronic glomerulonephritis 2.
Restrictive lung disease 5.
HTN 6.
Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis 7. s/p L AV fistula 8. hypercholesterolemia 9.
Diffusion severely reduced.
Moderate restrictive disease w/ severe reduction in diffusion capacity.
[**2171-11-15**] ECHO: EF 60-65%, mild concentric LVH, oderate biatrial enlargement; mildr tricuspid and trace pulmonic regurgitation.
Renal transplant u/s: No hydronephrosis.
Bronchial washings [**12-13**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis involving large portions of both lower lobes.
The possibility of superimposed consolidation (reflecting pneumonia or aspiration) is difficult to exclude.
Ascites and subcutaneous edema, consistent with diffuse third spacing of fluid.
Small amount of hyperdense material within the gallbladder, which may represent stones or sludge.
Three rounded soft tissue density structures between posterior ribs near the spine as described, which may represent lymph nodes.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic  hypertension.
Bone Marrow biopsy: Peripheral blood granulocytic dysplasia, along with dysplasia of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages in the bone marrow aspirate raises the possibility of myelodysplastic syndrome.
In the absence of myelotoxic or myelo-stimulatory therapy, the findings are suspicious for refractory cytopenia with multi-lineage dysplasia (RCMD) in the WHO classification.
However, we note that the patient is critically ill, has end stage renal disease and is under several medications.
We further recommend a repeat biopsy for confirmation and evaluation for definitive diagnosis.
Bronchial washings [**12-19**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Reactive pulmonary macrophages and scattered yeast forms some of which appear to be within cells.
R UE u/s: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3.The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Again seen are moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Renal u/s: No interval change in the appearance of the transplanted kidney in the left lower quadrant.
Chronic allograft nephropathy.
Diabetic nephropathy.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is  seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the  right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is a  focal simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
Mild-moderate aortic stenosis is suggested (not quantified).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve  leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There  is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 49 yo M w/ ESRD s/p kidney transplant on chronic immunosuppressive therapy, presenting with AMS, thrombocytopenia, ARF, hemolytic anemia and pancytopenia, and respiratory failure with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, with MDS on BM bx and persistent fevers of unknown origin, now on HD.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure/pulmonary edema: likely secondary to volume overload in setting of ESRD +/- possible Ventilator associated pneumonia.
Cultures revealed no growth and he completed a 7 day course of zosyn/vancomycin for possible ventilator associated pneumonia.
He had some difficulty weaning off of PEEP believed to be secondary to volume overload in the setting of renal failure and his HD was increased to QD.
However, he failed extubation after 2 hours with tachypnea and low tidal volumes and was reintubated.
He underwent trach and PEG without complication.
He was slowly able to be weaned off the vent with gradual return of respiratory muscle strength.
Prior to discharge he had no mechanical ventilation requirements and was maintained on trach mask alone.
# Fever: Patient had been spiking fevers as high as 102 in the ICU.
He had a thorough work up for infection with all culture and serology negative except for a weakly positive IgM for Ehrlichia at IgM Ab + 1:80 titer.
Further studies were sent and he was started on doxycycline for presumed Ehrlichia infection.
Because of persistent fevers his temporary dialysis catheter as well as his PICC were pulled and tip cultures were negative.
They were then resent because of persistent fevers and were again negative.
BK virus, cryptococcal Ag, and Babesia PCR were also drawn.
BK virus was strongly positive in the urine but was negative in the serum suggesting renal transplant colonization.
Cryptococcus and Babesia were negative.
LP was negative for infection.
TEE was negative for valve vegetation.
He completed a 7 day course of vancomycin/zosyn for possible ventilator associated pneumonia.
Following discontinuation of broad spectrum antibiotics, he remained afebrile on only doxycycline for presumed Ehrlichia infection.
He completed a 14 day course of doxycycline and then again spiked a fever with associated hypotension.
His steroids were tapered to baseline required for immunosuppresion for his renal transplant.
He also received a CT abdomen to evaluate for intrabdominal abscess, lymphoma, or other malignancy which was negative.
There was no clear cause of his intermittent fevers throughout admission.
# Pancytopenia: There was evidence of hemolytic anemia based on admission Hct, haptoglobin, and peripheral smear.
However, per heme/onc and transfusion medicine, there were only few schistocytes on peripheral smear and was not believed to be consistent with TTP-HUS.
There was initially some concern that anemia could have been due to Cyclosporin and it was stopped.
Parvovirus DNA and Ehrlichia serologies were drawn as above to work up possible contribution and Ehrlichia was only weakly positive.
# Acute on CRI - s/p renal transplant.
Cyclosporine level was 89 on admission but concern for contribution to pancytopenia and was stopped as above.
He received a biopsy of his transplant kidney which showed no evidence of acute rejection.
It was thought that his acute renal failure was most likely secondary to ATN.
Due to this, his cyclosporin was stopped given risk for renal vasoconstriction.
He was initially managed with triweekly dialysis which was increased to daily dialysis to help improve respiratory status.
Therefore, prior to discharge, he received a tunneled Quinton line for further dialysis after discharge while his ATN continued to resolve.
# Hypertension - Patient had been resistant to multiple medications as outpatient previously.
Prior to initiation of daily dialysis, patient was also extremely hypertensive on the floor.
Blood pressures improved with initiation of daily dialysis and he blood pressure medications were cut back.
Diltiazem was also added for atrial fibrillation as described below.
# Atrial fibrillation - He was initially found to be in Atrial fibrillation on admission believed to be most likely secondary to adrenergic surge in the setting of sepsis.
EP then recommended chemical cardioversion as they felt he would be high risk of reverting to Afib in the setting of acute illness.
# Diabetes.
- Patient was started on hydrocortisone for immunosuppression and had significant elevation in his blood sugars.
However, following resolution of his fevers, he had some episodes of hypoglycemia and his insulin was cut back.
With return of his fevers and initiation of stress dose steroids in the setting of hypotension, his blood sugars once again elevated rapidly and he was started on an insulin drip.
The drip was continued until his steroids were weaned back down to his maintenance dose for immunosuppression for his renal transplant.
# PPX - SC heparin followed by heparin drip followed by coumadin.
