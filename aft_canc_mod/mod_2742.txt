Patient had an EGD that revealed esophagitis and gastritis.
Here bleeding scan negative for source of active bleeding, but study limited due to contrast in the abdomen.

Patient was transferred out to the floor on [**2171-5-10**] and went into respiratory failure secondary to flash pulmonary edema from diastolic dysfunction.
Patient was exubated the following day after diuresis and hemodialysis.

Endoscopy: Linear erythema of mucosa was noted in the stomach body.
Findings consistent with gastritis  Right upper extremity ultrasound: FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, and left subclavian veins were performed.
A small amount of non-occlusive fibrinous material is demonstrated within the right internal jugular vein.
No thrombus is identified in the right subclavian or axillary veins.
There are small hypoechoic subcutaneous collections demonstrated in the right upper arm consistent with hematomas.
Note is made of a right cephalic to brachial AV fistula, which limits evaluation of the distal waveforms.
Limited evaluation of the right brachial vein demonstrates no evidence for occlusive thrombus  Echocardiogram [**2171-5-8**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The colonoscopy showed polyps in the transverse and distal colon and the EGD was showed gastritis.
The polyps that were found were not removed given the fact that the patient had recent GI bleed.
Patient will need a repeat colonoscopy in about 1 month to have polyps removed.
Patient also underwent pill endoscopy to find a possible source of bleeding in the small bowel, results will be forwarded to patient's primary care doctor for further follow up if needed.
## Resp Failure - When patient was initially transferred to floor from surgery ICU he became hypoxic and needed to be intubated.
The most likely cause was flash pulmonary edema since patient was getting IVF.
Serial chest xrays showed that the patient has bilateral pleural effusions which improved after dialysis.
# Renal Failure: Most likely secondary to HTN and DM.
Anti-coagulation for Afib was held since patient with active GI bleed in hospital.
## CHF - Patient intially started on Coreg which was later changed to Toprol XL 50mg.
He most likely has diastolic dysfunction.
## Leukocytosis/UTI - While in the ICU patient with elevated WBC and hypothermic.
Cultures were sent which came back positive for Proteus species in urine, sputum, and femoral line tip.
## RUE fistula - Patient right upper extremity continued to be swollen.
Venogram did show stenosis and PTA was performed by IR which improved swelling.
