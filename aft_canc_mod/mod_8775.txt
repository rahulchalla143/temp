At that time, she underwent left needle-localized lumpectomy, sentinel node biopsy, and low axillary dissection.
She has also noticed lightheadedness and has needed to steady herself when walking.
She has had a cough, productive of yellow sputum.
No hemoptysis.
+bilateral ankle swelling.
The symptoms became worse over the past couple of days, leading the patient to present to the ED.
Bedside ultrasound showed significant bilateral pleural effusion without pericardial effusion.
The patient was given levofloxacin and vancomycin due to concern for infection.
She was guaiac negative, but head CT showed an abnormality for which the differential included subarachnoid hemorrhage, so heparin was not started.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient stated that her breathing was improved.

IMAGING: # [**2200-6-13**] CXRay: IMPRESSION:  Bilateral moderate pleural effusions with adjacent bibasilar atelectasis and mild pulmonary congestion.
Pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded in the right clinical setting.
Left lower lobe segmental pulmonary embolism without evidence of right heart strain or pulmonary infarction.
Interlobular septal thickening is concerning for fluid overload.
Given the lack of nodularity, carcinomatosis seems much less likely, but is hard to completely excluded.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right than the left.
In conjunction with the septal thickening, these are most likely secondary to fluid overload from CHF, although malignant effusions cannot be completely excluded.
Subcutaneous air in the left breast, possibly extending to the skin.
# [**6-13**] CT head: Abnormal gyriform hyperdensity in the left frontal lobe of uncertain etiology in the setting of prior intravenous contrast administration, but the differential diagnosis includes abnormal enhancement associated with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, possibly with a parenchymal mass or edema; although unlikely, it is not possible to exclude hemorrhage.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
# [**6-14**] MRI w and w/o contrast: CONCLUSION:  Left frontal and right parietal enhancing lesions appear most likely to be subacute infarction, with the right parietal lesion more recentthan the left frontal.
# [**6-14**] CTA head:  No vascular abnormalities detected on the head CTA.
Left frontal enhancement and left mastoid opacification appear unchanged.
# [**6-16**] CXR IMPRESSION:  Moderate left and trace right pleural effusion with likely mild pulmonary edema.
# [**6-20**] Left axillary U/S: FINDINGS: A focused left axilla ultrasound was performed in the in the region of concern.
A 2nd more inferior collection measures 7 x 6.5 cm.
IMPRESSION: Two, apparently communicating, 5 and 7 cm complex fluid collections in the left axilla may represent hematomas although infection cannot be excluded.
Flow into the more superior collection may be due to mobile fluid or slow continued bleeding (felt less likely).
Brief Hospital Course: 55 yo female with hx breast cancer, HTN, DM2, who presented with dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema found to have a PE, bilateral pleural effusions, and pericardial effusion with new systolic CHF.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # PE: Pt presented with DOE, orthopnea and cough, likely due in part to new diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was guaiac negative, but head CT showed an abnormality for which the differential included subarachnoid hemorrhage, so initiation of heparin was deferred and pt was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
She had a TTE which was negative for any evidence of right heart strain.
# systolic CHF: Because of new pleural effusions noted on chest CT, TTE was performed which showed severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with EF of 25% along with small pericardial effusion (no tamponade), which was new from prior echo at start of chemo therapy.
The concern is that her new diagnosis of CHF may have been secondary to chemotherapy she received for recent diagnosis of breast cancer.
She was initially diuresed, but this was complicated by hypotensive episodes.
Her pleural fluid cytology was negative for malignant cells.
# Axillary fluid collection: Pt was noted to have increasing erythema, warmth and induration in left axilla at site of recent breast drainage.
Surgery was consulted and drained a small collection of serosanguinous fluid.
She was initially started on Keflex for presumed cellulitis, however the patient was afebrile and without leukocytosis so Keflex was discontinued.
Her factor X level was checked given that patient was on Lovenox and there was concern that if she was supratherapeutic, it may be contributing to bleeding within her recent surgical site.
She had a left axillary ultrasound that did show a communicating fluid collection so surgery drained more fluid.
At time of discharge, pain and induration had improved, and pt will follow up with surgery as an outpatient.
# Brain MRI c/w infarcts: Because of abnormal head CT obtained in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] MRI was obtained which showed several enhancing lesions consistent with subacute infarcts.
# neuropathy: Pt complained of recent onset lower extremity tingling, concerning for chemotherapy induced neuropathy.
CHRONIC ISSUES" # Breast cancer: Staged as 2B s/p treatment with Adriamycin and cyclophosphamide, Taxol, and weekly Herceptin, needle-localized lumpectomy, sentinel node biopsy, and low axillary dissection with pleural effusion negative for malignancy.
Her further chemotherapy options may be limited as pt appeared to develop CHF in setting of active chemotherapy.
Her insulin dose was decreased during this hospitalization given low blood sugars.
# Depression: Continued bupropion  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # Pt's hypercoagulable work up was pending at time of discharge and should be followed as an outpatient.
# She will need to establish care with cardiology as an outpatient for continued adjustment of medications given her new diagnosis of heart failure.

You were admitted for shortness of breath.
You were found to have a pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in your lungs) as well as congestive heart failure.
You were noticed to have some bleeding into your left breast where you had surgery.
