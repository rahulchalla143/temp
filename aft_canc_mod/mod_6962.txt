Hx of homelesness during teens.
Fiance with cold symptoms.
Pets: + dog   Family History: -No hx htn, cad/mi, cancer -Diabetes--mother, grandfather, grandmother -Father passed away at 76 due to "natural causes' -Mother is 76  Physical Exam: On Admission: Vitals: T 99.5 BP 187/79 (180-217/70-85) HR 68 RR 18 SaO2 96%ra  General: no acute distress, sitting in bed talking on phone, comfortable and appropriate HEENT: NC/AT, sclerae anicteric, MMM, no exudates in oropharynx  Neck: supple, no nuchal rigidity, no bruits Lungs: clear to auscultation CV: regular rate and rhythm, no MMRG Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present Ext: warm, no edema, pedal pulses appreciated Skin: no rashes  Neurologic Examination: Mental Status: Awake and alert, following all commands, slightly odd affect Oriented to person, place, time Language: Speech fluent with good comprehension and repetition.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors, or asterixis.
Poor R wave progression.
Cannot rule out prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2184-5-14**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
Right upper lobe opacification and right mediatinal fullness corresponds to thick walled upper lobe cavity and mediastinal lymphadenopathy with differential including Wegener's, SCC/cancer, and fungal infection.
No new focus of consolidation is seen.
There is no effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged highly abnormal chest radiograph.
MRI Head [**5-29**]: IMPRESSION: Multiple enhancing lesions are identified in the brain as described above.
Although metastatic disease is a consideration, given the restricted diffusion on the diffusion-weighted images, infection needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis.
The appearances could also be secondary to multiple tuberculomas given a cavitary lesion in the lung.
Findings consistent with extensive metastatic disease, including pulmonary nodules, bilateral adrenal masses, and bilateral renal masses.
Lymphadenopathy in mediastinal, right greater than left hilar, retroperitoneal, and mesenteric locations, consistent with nodal spread of neoplastic disease.
Cavitary pulmonary nodule in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, suspicious for primary lung carcinoma.
Right upper lobe pulmonary interstitial thickening, suspicious for lymphangetic spread.
Subtle sclerosis in the T4 vertebral body.
Wedge-shaped peripheral opacity in the right middle lobe, evolving since the prior chest CTA.
Second evolving process in the right upper.
While these may be secondary to infection, the morphology of the right middle lobe opacity raises the possibility of a pulmonary infarct.
Head CT [**5-30**](post-bx): IMPRESSION: Post-surgical changes from recent resection of the left frontal lesion with minimal high attenuation in the resection bed and moderate perilesional vasogenic edema causing effacement of the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle without shift of midline structures.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No valveular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes and regiona/global systolic function.
[**2184-6-4**] CT head IMPRESSION: Extensive bilateral areas of vasogenic edema, from known brain metastasis.
Of significance, she is status post diagnosis of lung mass for which she was being worked up on an outpatient basis.
High dose steroid therapy was initiated to treat associated vasogenic edema.
She was then returned to the ICU pending diagnosis and further management.
She was initiated on whole brain radiation on [**2184-6-2**] and was monitored in the ICU for signs and symptoms of increased ICP.
During initiation of her brain radiation treatments, patient had intractable nausea, vomiting, headache, and hypertension, but repeat CT head did not show increased edema.
For nausea control, she was kept on compazine, zofran, ativan, phenergen PRN.
Her symptoms gradually subsided and she was transitioned to po meds.
Hypertension -- While unable to tolerate po, she was treated with IV hydralazine for goal SBP of less than 130 mmHg.
Asthma -- remained stable throughout her course, continued prn albuterol.
Hyperglycemia -- associated with high dose steroids and managed with a sliding scale without difficulty.
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for anxiety.
Tylenol 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO every four (4) hours as needed for fever or pain.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 Puffs Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath.
Non-small cell lung cancer with multiple brain metastases 2.
Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Neurologically Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with altered mental status secondary to your newly [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 106995**] [**Last Name (un) **] metastasis.
- Take lisinopril for high blood pressure.
- Take lorazepam at night as needed for anxiety.
