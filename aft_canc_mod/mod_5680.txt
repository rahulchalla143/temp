SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
No new focus of edema or other acute intracranial abnormalities identified.
The known right pontine lesion is better visualized on MRI.
New air space consolidation involving the right upper and left lower lobes.
As these findings were not present on [**2152-8-17**], this findings are most consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
Stable emphysema and post-surgical changes of right lower lobectomy.
Right upper lobe nodules, not changes, suggestive of small airways infection.
hip x-ray - no evidence of acute fracture  forearm x-ray - IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture or dislocation  [**9-14**] chest x-ray IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe patchy opacity concerning for pneumonia.
Likely etiology of aspiration in the setting of progressive neurological decline.
Patient was on levofloxacin and flagyl for a few days, but stopped on [**9-17**] when CXR demonstrated a rapid resolution of right sided opacity unlikely to be consistent with infectious etiology.
Patient was not febrile and did well without antibiotics.
# Nonsmall cell lung cancer with known pontine mass: New left sided weakness, slurred speech, multiple neurologic abnormalities concerning for worsening metastatic disease.
# CAD s/p CABG [**2139**], EF of 20-30% [**3-4**] by echo: No evidence of chest pain or volume overload.
# H/o Non sustained VT: Continued Amiodarone and monitored on telemetry without event.
Nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for thrush.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Nonsmall cell lung cancer .
Hypothyroidism Depression/Anixety CAD s/p CABG [**2139**] Non sustained VT on Amiodarone Ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF of 20-30% [**3-4**] by echo Bilateral cataract surgery Erectile dysfunction Avascular necrosis of right humerus S/P Cholecystectomy S/P Right shoulder surgery x 2 Resting Tremor   Discharge Condition: stable, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You presented to the hospital with left sided weakness and difficulty breathing.
Your left weakness was felt to be secondary to the brain lesions from lung cancer.
Your difficulty breathing was likely due to aspiration.
You were started on antibiotics for a few days, but they were stopped because it was not felt that you had a lung infection.
Please seek immediate medical attention if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, worsening cough, fevers, chills, worsening weakness, loss of conciousness or any other change from your baseline health status.
