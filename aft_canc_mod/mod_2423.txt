HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 54-year-old gentleman who presented with dysphagia last year with endoscopic diagnosis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the esophagus with a lesion seen 30 to 33 cm with partial esophageal obstruction and two similar masses more distal.
There was no evidence of distal metastasis at the time of staging.
Approximately three weeks later, the patient developed severe lower back pain with further work up.
He was found to have metastatic lesions at the L2, L3 level.
He was admitted most recently to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital3 2063**] with recurrent respiratory distress and hypotension, stabilized in the ICU.
It was noted that his lower back pain was increasing in the past two to three days.
He complained of mild onset of paresthesias to the left lower extremity and he was diagnosed with a right middle lobe and right lower lobe pneumonia by chest x-ray.
CT Scan of the chest was positive for infiltrates.
MRI showed significant compression of the thecal sac.
Patient also has a past medical history of diabetes type 2 and past surgical history of distal esophagectomy and partial gastrectomy.
Lungs:  Decreased breath sounds with faint rales and rhonchi to the right lower base posterior, otherwise clear.
Abdomen:  Has a midline incision which is clean and dry.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Sensation was intact to light touch without saddle anesthesia.
MRI from [**Hospital1 **] shows compression fracture of the L2-L3 level with retropulsion and compression of the thecal sac.
Patient underwent anterior vertebroplasty from the L2-L4 levels by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2184-11-26**] without inter-procedure complication.
During the removal of the methacrylate from the L2-L3 disc space, a large amount of anterior bleeding was encountered emanating from the region of the aorta.
This was quickly packed off with large sponges and manual pressure.
This was maintained until Vascular Cardiac surgeons arrived.
Due to ongoing pressure requirements and metabolic derangements following vascular repair, the decision was made to not proceed with the vertebrectomy and spinal stabilization.
During closure of the skin, the patient developed a wide complex heart rhythm, V-tach, V-fib and requiring CPR.
He had four liters of blood loss at the time and also had a clot in the distal aorta on cross clamping which caused loss of pulses in the lower extremities below the femoral arteries.
His temperature was 100.3 F, blood pressure was 98/54 and he was Amiodarone drip as well as Fentanyl for pain, Levophed and an insulin drip.
for breakthrough pain.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was in stable condition at the time of discharge and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] next week for staple removal.
