Admission Date:  [**2187-1-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2187-1-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2124-11-17**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 732**] is a 62-year-old male with a very longstanding history of reflux disease which, in recent months, has significantly worsened.
The patient had an upper endoscopy performed prior to admission which showed a nonbleeding nodular mass found at 40 cm to 42 cm in the esophagus, occupying approximately 50% of the lumen.
Biopsies of the mass were performed at that time which showed glandular dysplasia, high-grade, arising in the background of [**Doctor Last Name 15532**] esophagus with chronic inactive gastritis.
No invasive carcinoma was identified at that time.
The patient has remained largely asymptomatic except for persistent heartburn.
He had no symptoms of dysphagia, weight loss, or blood loss.
There were no symptoms of nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.
Also, there was no family history of esophageal cancer.
In addition, an endoscopic ultrasound was performed at the same time which showed a mass involving the muscularis propia; consistent with a T2 lesion.
In addition, there was a small less than 10-cm lymph node noted which did not appear to be hypoechoic, was not rounded, and did not have sharp margins; and thus did not appear to have any endosonographically malignant features.
Reflux disease.
History of hepatitis A.
The neck was supple without masses, nodes, or thyromegaly.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
No masses were palpable.
Extremities revealed no signs of cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A computed tomography scan of the abdomen performed on [**2186-12-1**] showed wall thickening at the gastroesophageal junction extending along the [**Last Name (un) 24082**] curvature of the stomach.
In addition, incidentally a 1.3-cm enhancing in the right kidney was noted as well as an 8-mm hypodense lesion in the tail of the pancreas of uncertain significance.
There were no complications.
The patient continued to do well until postoperative day two when he was noted to have a decrease in his respiratory rate to 6 on [**2187-1-10**].
Given the history of alcohol use, it was thought that his symptoms were due to delirium tremens (DT).
A chest x-ray at this time showed postoperative changes with small pleural effusions.
However, alcohol withdrawal was also a likely contributor to his agitation and confusion.
A CAT scan of the head was performed on [**2187-1-14**] which showed no evidence of acute hemorrhage.
The CAT scan was obtained to rule out any organic cause of postoperative delirium.
The patient was intubated on [**2187-1-12**] without any complications.
The patient also appeared to have a low-grade fever.
A sputum culture obtained on [**2187-1-14**] grew coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative rods.
