There was no intervention at that time.
He then had an admission to an OSH in [**2140-5-4**] for upper GI Bleed and found to have an ampullary mass.
At that time his Hct fell to 21 and he developed chest pain.
He was transfused with resolution of chest pain.
On [**2140-6-14**] he was admitted to the CMI service at [**Hospital1 18**] for elective cardiac cath.

13           LV stroke volume index (nl 35-75 ml/m2).
Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal LAD with a 3.5 x 18 mm Vision BMS which was postdilated to 3.75 mm distally.
CT HEAD [**2140-6-14**]: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Chronic small vessel infarction.
No evidence to suggest acute infarction, however suspicion remains high, an MRI would be more sensitive to assess for this.
MRI HEAD [**2140-6-15**]: 1) No evidence of acute infarction.
Chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
CAROTID U/S [**2140-6-15**]: Moderate plaque with a right 40-59% carotid stenosis.
male with newly diagnosed ampullary mass, HTN, Hyperlipid now s/p elective cath with 2 bare metal stents to LAD with subsequent upper GI Bleed and diplopia concerning for acute CVA.
1) CAD s/p elective cath: Patient was continued on Aspirin, Plavix, and atorvastatin after his catheterization.
Patient did not have any further CP or SOB after transfer to the CCU.
2) Reversible ischemic neurologic deficit (RIND) presenting with isolated left medial rectus plegia without nystagmus :  Patient was consulted by neurology.
Work up included carotid U/S dopplers which did not show significant stenosis, and CT and MRI of the brain which did not show any signs of acute infarction.
Ophthalmoplegia and diplopia resolved after 3 days without intervention.
Will continue aspirin and statin as outpatient and have patient follow up in stroke clinic if new symptoms arise.
3) Upper GI Bleed: Patient arrived to the CCU after vomiting 300+cc of blood which was thought to be due to his known ampullary mass.
Hematemasis resolved and patient was taken for EGD which showed no further bleeding, but friable tissue over the ampullary mass.
Patient did have some abdominal discomfort which resolved after his hematemasis subsided.
Patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 6 weeks for repeat EGD and resection of mass (must be off Plavix for 2 weeks prior to procedure.)
