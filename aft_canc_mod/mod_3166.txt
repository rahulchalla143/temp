HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61-year-old right-handed woman with a history of anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (grade III) that was diagnosed in [**2177-10-3**], as well as hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism who initially presented in late [**Month (only) **] with severe headaches, aphagia, and loss of ability to read and tell time, as well as making multiple paraphasic errors.
The patient had a brain biopsy in early [**Month (only) 1096**] at [**Hospital3 418**] Hospital which was re-read here by Pathology as a grade III anaplastic oligoastrocytoma with myotic figures and necrosis.
The patient was started on Decadron and Dilantin; and her headache, as well as some of the language problems improved; although, she has continued to have a Wernicke aphagia since that time.
She was initially on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis; however, that was recently changed to valproic acid because of a rash she had on Dilantin.
The husband denies any other recent illness or symptoms.
The patient is a poor historian, but on direct questioning denies any pain or shortness of breath; but her responses were somewhat unreliable.
Anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (as above).
Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (times two to three years).
High cholesterol.
ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history is positive for coronary artery disease and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
The abdomen was obese and benign.
Extremities showed no edema.
Mental status examination revealed the patient was not able to answer questions appropriately with multiple nonsensical affluent remarks with occasional content and an occasional ability to answer questions; however, mostly with decreased naming, decreased repetition, and only occasional comprehension.
She had a right superior quadrant diplopia with decreased blink to thrill on the right.
Motor examination revealed full strength throughout with no drift.
We were not able to assess coordination due to poor cooperation with the examination.
She had a urinalysis which showed no evidence of infection.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  She also had a chest x-ray which showed no evidence of new infiltrate.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient remained in the Emergency Room overnight, as there were no hospital beds available.

There were a few millimeters of midline shift; however, there was no evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus.

However, since she had no history of seizures complicating her course so far, she was continued on her same dose of Depakote.
Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
High cholesterol.
