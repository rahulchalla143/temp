Admission Date:  [**2106-12-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2106-12-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2076-7-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Compazine / Cefepime  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 30 y/o female with a h/o leukemia s/p BMT in [**12-7**] presenting with shortness of breath.
She reports a 3 week history of cough, productive occasionally of white sputum, but that her symptoms of shortness of breath with excertion became acutely worse.
She presented to the heme/onc clinic and was found to have desaturations to 70%.
In the ED: CXR with interstitial markings on left, CTA performed showed a PE, ground glass process c/w with possible oppotunisitic infection.
Has had tx c/b coag neg.
HTN s/p gastric bypass [**2104**] h/o MRSA, VRE, C Diff s/p line sepsis [**2106-3-3**] gastric ulcer with UGIB s/p vessel clipping [**2106-8-3**]  Social History: Originally from [**Country 3587**] but moved to the US when she was 2 yrs old, currently lives in [**Doctor Last Name 792**]with her husband and daughter, used to work as a [**Name (NI) **] and phlebotomist until [**9-6**].
Family History: MGM - CLL, mom DM [**Name (NI) **], HTN, dad HTN, sister asthma  Physical Exam: Per Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] T:98.8 BP:133/60  O2:95% on 100% non-rebreather, 90%sleeping, Gen: Alert, oriented, NAD HEENT: Clear OP, MMM NECK: Supple, No LAD, No JVD CV: RR, NL rate.
No HSM EXT: No edema.
Filling defect in the right upper lobe apical segmental pulmonary arterial branch consistent with a pulmonary embolism.
Mosaic attenuation in the upper lobes bilaterally could represent air trapping, small airways disease, or alveolitis.
Additionally, there are multiple areas of ground-glass opacity predominantly in a bronchovascular distribution in the upper lobes, left worse than right with additional areas that are more peripherally located.
This finding is nonspecific, however, given the patient's history, early infectious process including opportunistic infection could be considered.
Atelectasis in the lingula and left lower lobe.
Nonspecific cluster of nodular opacities in the right lower lobe.
[**2106-12-9**]: CXR: Resolution of left lower lobe pneumonia.
New left-sided pleural effusion, small .
[**2106-12-11**]: CXR: Cardiac silhouette and mediastinum is normal.
There is again seen some hazy opacity at the left base which may represent early infiltrate versus atelectasis.
There is also a new area of increased density within the left upper lung zone, also concerning for developing infiltrate.
There is no signs of pulmonary edema.
There is a left pleural effusion, which is small.
Persistent left upper lobe consolidation, most likely infectious.
Resolution of left retrocardiac atelectasis.
[**2106-12-19**]: CXR: Continued left upper lobe infiltrate .
Left lower lobe pneumonia has resolved.
Generalized increase in multifocal peribronchial infiltration, particularly left upper lobe, could be due to either opportunistic infection, typically viral or pneumocystis, or recurrence of graft versus host disease, less likely hemorrhage, and not fungal or bacterial infection.
New pneumomediastinum, presumably related to coughing or bronchospasm in the absence of mediastinal fluid collection or esophageal abnormality.
Multifocal air trapping, presumably bronchiolitis obliterans.
Anterior extrapleural/chest wall mass or infection, stable since [**12-9**], new since [**6-15**].
Micro: Blood cultures from [**12-9**] 12/8 [**12-12**] 12/11 [**12-14**] [**12-15**] negative urine cx [**12-9**] neg sputum cx neg, PCP negative direct flu antigen negative CMV negative [**12-10**], pending for [**12-21**] cryptococcal neg urine legionella negative resp viral antigens negative B Glucan negative histo negative Adenovirus negative galactomannin pending  Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 30 yo woman with h/o AML s/p allo BMT presenting with fever, hypoxia, a small PE and ground-glass opacities on CT scan.
# Respiratory/ID: The patient was admitted from the emergency department to the ICU for evaluation and treatment of her severe hypoxia (70%).
She did not require intubation as she had excellent oxygen saturations with non-invasive measures.
The source of her hypoxia was not readily identified, but possible contributing etiologies considered were: PCP pneumonia, [**Name Initial (PRE) **] known PE seen on CTA, atypical/fungal infection, or GVHD of the lung.
Bronchoscopy was considered but there was concern she would be unable to tolerate it given her poor respiratory status.
# Respiratory/PE: The patient had a small PE on her initial CT angiogram.
It was concerning for bronchiolitis obliterans given the airtrapping.
# AML: s/p BMT and DLI.
We did not notice any blasts in her peripheral white blood cells.
# Nodular mass on anterior chest wall: Both of the CT chest scans showed a nodular mass on the anterior chest wall.
She did not have any tenderness over this region.
# Nodular mass on right side of back: Patient had a 1cm nontender nodular mass on the right side of her back.
We were concerned that it was secondary to antibiotics.
She did not complain of any right upper quadrant or abdominal pain.
