Patient has had difficulty with seroma and was recently discharged on [**3-22**] home on augmentin after IR drainage of seroma located just right of the pudendum.
He was at home, doing relatively well until this morning when he noted progressive swelling of his right upper leg / thigh area.
Here he is in no apparent distress, afebrile, but has diffuse swelling of the entire right leg, markedly larger than the left leg, and erythema which is blanching throughout the anterior thigh.
He is not tender, but there is diffuse edema.
His drain is putting out minimal fluid which is serosanguinous, and flushes with minimal difficulty.
Past Medical History: PMH:  - metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (unknown primary lesion)  - CAD s/p MI (remote), EF 50%  - Aortic stenosis  - Afib on coumadin  - HTN  - BPH  - L retinal artery occlusion in [**2134**] (secondary to emoblic disease)  PSH:  - R inguinal lymph node dissection ([**2146-2-10**])  - L inguinal hernia repair ([**2135**])   Social History: nonsmoker, lives with wife, no EtOH   Family History: CAD in multiple family members   Physical Exam: EXAM: Vitals: 97.6  56  99/54  22  97RA AAO x 3, NAD RRR, [**4-3**] holosystolic murmur noted on auscultation CTA B/L no RRW appreciated soft, NT, ND.
There are degenerative changes, but no suspicious bone lesions are present.
A 2.6 x 2.2 cm collection in the right groin containing a drainage catheter is present, smaller than on the previous examination.
Inferior to the collection containing a drain is an ovoid collection measuring 3.2 x 1.5 cm (3:164).
CTV: Normal venous opacification is seen in the inferior vena cava and extending into the common iliac and leg veins without signs for vascular distention, or occlusion.
There is atherosclerotic disease of the popliteal, and common femoral artery, but no aneurysm or occlusion.
Increased density of contrast in the right leg veins compared to the left may indicate increased venous return due to hyperemia on the right.
CT [**3-29**] - Hypodense fluid collection with areas of hyperdensity is visualized in the right thigh measuring 13 cm in the craniocaudal dimension x 3.8 cm in the transverse dimension.
There is also a 4.7 CC x 3.8 TV cm hypodense fluid collection inferior to the first collection which may be contiguous with the superior collection.
Upper ext US - Non-occlusive thrombus surrounding the PICC at site of insertion in the left basilic vein.
No proximal thrombus identified.
During his hospital course, he did require a brief ICU admission for hypotension [**2146-3-28**].
There were no complication to the procedure.
Neuro: The patient received Tylenol and morphine with good effect and adequate pain control.

The patient found having a foley catheter to be comfortable and reported difficulty urinating due to difficulty relaxing.
Due to overall poor nutritional status, he was started on nutritional shakes.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
His wound cultures did return with Pseudomonas and pan-sensitive enterococcus.
This likely due to bleeding from his incision which ceased.
Pt was encouraged to get up and ambulate, though he felt slightly deconditioned toward end of stay.

The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, and pain was well controlled.
