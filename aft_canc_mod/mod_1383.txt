Admission Date:  [**2185-5-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-5-17**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal pains, BRBPR  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Colonscopy done [**2185-5-11**]  History of Present Illness: The patient is an 89 year old female with a history of stroke, seizures, vascular dementia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and CAD who presented with complaints of abdominal pain, BRBPR and loose stools x 1 week.
Patient had a colonoscopy [**2185-4-29**] as part of an evaluaton for anemia which showed grade 1 internal hemorrhoids, a polyp that was removed via polypectomy and a cecal angioectesia that was treated via thermal therapy.
The patient is a poor historian, but from transfer records and ED sign out, she had been having worsening abdominal pain for the last week.
She had concurrently developed frequent loose stools that were particularly malodorous.
Labs were checked at her nursing home, which showed an elevated WBC of 16.
Records show recent low grade temperatures as well.
A CT scan was obtained which initially was read as only having diverticulosis.
A chest x-ray showed a question of a retrocardiac opacity, so the patient was given levofloxacin/vancomycin in ED for PNA coverage.
Later, and updated read of the CT-abdomen questioned possible small diverticultis, and Flagyl was added.
Past Medical History: # Syncope since [**2179**]: per neuro note [**5-3**], these occur while sitting in church, at a funeral, and eating.

Upper extremities with no gross motor deficits.
Skin: multiple small moles and skin tags over her neck and upper torso, no lesions, open sores or rashes noted.
[**5-7**] EKG: HR 108, Sinus tachycardia with ventricular premature beats.
Possible left ventricular hypertrophy.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
Severe sigmoid and descending colonic diverticulosis with mild diverticulitis.
Recent colonoscopy showed no masses.
Multiple fibroids with several degenerating fibroids with large right complex exophytic fibroid.
Right adnexal mass which has features consistent with a complex dermoid.
Heterogeneous mass adjacent to the right border of the uterus, is likely a uterine fibroid.
No evidence for ischemic colitis.
No bowel obstruction or dilation.
Bilateral adrenal calcifications, which may be due to granulomatous disease or remote hemorrhage .
[**5-7**] CXR - There are persistent low lung volumes.
Opacity in the left lower lobe is likely atelectasis.
Atelectasis in the right base is unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusions.
No other interval change.
[**5-13**] CXR - There are low lung volumes.
Subsegmental atelectasis are in the left base.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
Moderate degenerative changes are in the thoracic spine.
Mild sigmoid diverticulitis.
Fat-containing mass anterior to the right psoas muscle.
A retroperitoneal liposarcoma is also possible but less likely.
findings are concerning for malignancy such as leiomyoscarcoma with lymph node metastases.
Small fat-containing umbilical hernia.
Prominent right pulmonary artery, suggesting pulmonary arterial hypertension.
#Rectal bleeding: Ms. [**Known lastname 34601**] was admitted with complaints of 2 days of bright red blood per rectum and initially had a stable hematocrit in the 28-32 range.
After several large bloody stools/clots passed on [**4-25**] she had Hct drop to 21 which prompted MICU transfer.
After transfer back to the general medical floor she also  remained hemodynamically stable and her abdominal pains and diarrhea tapered off and completely abated by time of discharge.
No complaints of any emesis during her hospital course but she experienced some nausea on the day she was sent to the ICU.
GI team followed her closely in the inpatient setting and performed a STAT colonoscopy on [**5-11**] when she had marked increase in her lower GI bleeding but there was no clear bleeding source; severe diverticulosis and grade 2 internal hemorrhoids were noted.
There was very little bleeding above the level of the cecum during scope procedure so the GI service felt she did not have any upper GI sources.
Possible bleed sites were perhaps from her recent polypectomy or her known cecal angioectasia sites/AVMs.
Polypectomy and thermal treatment to her angioectasias in cecum done the first week in [**Month (only) 547**] just prior to her complaints of bleeding so the timeline certainly favors a re-bleed from one of these sites.
Team has been holding usual Plavix therapy for her CVA history due to GI bleeding.
# Hypotension: Ms. [**Known lastname 34601**] has now fully recovered from a brief drop in her blood pressures in the acute setting of her GI bleed earlier in her hospital course.
She had a drop to 50/palp on medical floor [**5-10**] but recovered after IVFs and 5 additional units of blood were given.
Most likely hypovolemic related drop from blood loss but she had a persistent leukocytosis concerning for inflammatory contributions to her hypotension as well, SIRS/sepsis etiology was in the differential initially but despite multiple tests and antibiotics she continued to have an elevated WBC and given the chronic course of her leukocytosis and all of her negative blood cultures it seemed much more likely that her BP drop was secondary to volume losses with GI bleeding vs. any infections.
#Leukocytosis:  Ms. [**Known lastname 34601**] had an isolated fever in the ED to 102F and a WBC count of 16 with a left shift noted at time of her admission.
Fevers tapered and she had no more significant bouts of any elevated temperatures during her hospital course.
At her outside facility she had been started on some Flagyl just prior to transfer to ED per reports due to some initial concerns for C.difficile as she was having some abdominal pains and loose stools with her lower GI bleeding.
She was continued on PO Flagyl however after a CT done [**5-7**] noted some area that was consistent with mild diverticulitis.
Soon after her GI bleeding stopped she had no more diarrhea and no abdominal cramps or pains.
After repeat CT Abdomen done [**5-15**] showed again mild diverticulitis she was started on a 7 day course of Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl, her last day should be [**2185-5-23**].
Initial diarrhea was probably from combination of her diverticulitis and added cathartic effects of GI bleeding.
There was a lengthy  workup for her persistent elevated WBC count which stayed in 16-20 range during her hospital course.
PNA was essentially ruled out as she had no cough or oxygen requirement and repeated CXRs showed no opacities.
She has no residual dysuria complaints or suprapubic tenderness at time of discharge today.
Leukocytosis continued despite adequate treatment of her UTI so she likely has another underlying insult or etiology behind elevated WBCs.
She has a borderline stage I-II debubitis lesion at sacral area but there are no deep wounds to promote such an elevated WBC level.
CT Abdomen/pelvis had also revealed some necrotic, older fibroids which may be promoting WBC elevations.
OB/Gynecology team was consulted and felt that her fibroids would not create such an elevated leukocytosis however.
Final CT abdomen read on repeat imaging done [**5-15**] showed a fat-containing mass anterior to the right psoas muscle.
This was possibly a teratoma originating from the right ovary or a potential retroperitoneal liposarcoma as well.
Malignancy is in the  differential, particulary given some prominence of iliac lymph nodes.
Infectious workup to explain her elevated WBC count was largely unrevealing.
The most likely explanation to date is diverticulitis on both abdominal CTs.
#Hypertension: Initially she had low to normotensive blood pressures and as above she became hypotensive in setting of GI bleeding so her usual HCTZ BP medication were held.
#Pelvic Mass: CT noted multiple degenerating fibroids with exophytic necrotic characteristics which were concerning.
Retroperitoneal malignancy such as liposarcoma questioned given some prominent iliac lymph nodes and location of mass.
Right adnexal mass had features most consistent with a complex dermoid or teratoma however.
Gynecology team was consulted and felt there were no indications for any immediate surgeries.
Follow-up pelvic US done and also confirmed right adnexal mass and fibroids as above.
She needs follow-up imaging in [**7-4**] weeks with MRI or CT along with a gynecology outpatient follow-up which has been arranged for early [**Month (only) **] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 34602**].
#Urinary Tract Infection: As above, she had an E.Coli UTI during this hospital stay which was treated for 7 days with IV Ceftriaxone, therapy ended on [**5-16**] and she has had no additional complaints of frequency , dysuria or suprapubic tenderness on exam.
#.Glaucoma: Longstanding issue, no new vision changes per patient on this admission.
In survey of prior CTs/MRIs unable to find any reports of any other overt large scale CVAs otherwise.
Team continued holding Plavix due to GI bleeding concerns.
Ambulation still quite limited and she needs assistance with walker as was the case just prior to admission with her usual baseline.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1186**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: #Lower gastrointestinal bleeding #Urinary Tract Infection .
Secondary: # Prior Syncopal episodes since [**2179**] # Hypertension # Hyperlipidemia # Vascular Dementia # Ptosis - # Glaucoma # Stroke by CT   Discharge Condition: Clinically stable.
No apparent distress.
You were admitted after noticing bleeding from your rectum and abdominal pains.
You had worsening bleeding that caused some drop in your blood pressures and you needed blood transfusions and IVFs to stabilize your blood pressure.
The gastrointestinal team was called and you underwent a colonoscopy which was unable to show the exact source of your bleeding although the team felt it was from a lower abdominal source.
Fortunately, you stopped bleeding and your blood cell counts stabilized.
You were also found to have a urinary tract infection during your hospitalization and you were treated with 7 days of IV antibiotics.
You had some peristent elevations in some white blood cell counts that need to be followed up with your primary care physician after discharge.
Several lab studies were done and imaging studies were done to try to find specific reasons for your high white blood cell counts but were normal.
Lastly, if you have any additional fevers, chills, burning with urination, bloody urine, diarrhea, bleeding per rectum, bloody stools, constipation, chest pains, fainting, dizziness or any other acute health concerns please contact your primary doctor or return to the emergency room.
