This was higher-intensity due to the underlying hepatic parenchyma on T2 weighted images, and the lesion contained a central scar.
On the delayed BOPTA images, there was some central washout from the dominant central lesions, as well as some small arterial enhancing lesion in the inferior aspect of the right lobe with residual peripheral right of contrast.
This was thought to be slightly unusual, but still most left compatible with FNH.
There is a second solid, 1.7-cm lesion in the inferior aspect of the right lobe thought to represent FNH, and is a 3.1-cm hemangioma in the inferior and lateral aspect of the right lobe.
These lesions were increased in size.
Due to the patient's symptoms, the enlarging mass, and its difficult location should it continue to enlarge and require resection, the patient has elected to proceed with hepatic resection.
