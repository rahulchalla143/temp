Admission Date:  [**2159-2-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2159-2-19**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2840**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: CVL placement and removal.
History of Present Illness: This is an 84 yo M with a past medical history significant for multiple myeloma (gets care at DF), on dexamethasone, who presents to the ED today with complaints of weakness and fatigue for several days.
He does not endorse any localizing symptoms, but notes that he is "not feeling well" and feels weak.
He describes that he had a near syncopal event yesterday.
He did not have his walker with him.
He endorses a prodrome of lightheadedness and felt "woozy" but denies loss of consciousness.
He describes possible fever/chills at home, but did not measure his temperature.
He denies any n/v/d, sick contacts, myalgias, chest pain, palpitations or headache.
He is complaining about severe sweating that occurs at night without any reason for which he had a work up at the VA that was unrevealing.
His lactate was 1.3, but labs were otherwise significant for a leukocytosis to 26,000 with a left shift, acute renal failure with a creatine of 2.3.
ECG was without acute change, and a troponin was elevated at 0.44, prompting a cardiology consult who advised that this was likely in the setting of ARF and hypotension and was not ACS.
At this time, the concern for relative adrenal insufficiency was raised and he was given a dose of stress dose hydrocortisone, with subsequent improvement in his BP to 88/39.
He denies pleuritic chest pain, palpitiations.

Small bilateral pleural effusions, slightly larger on the right, with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
No source for sepsis identified on CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
Multiple renal cysts, measuring up to 11 cm on the right and 4 cm on the left, containing simple fluid.
A smaller 14-mm exophytic cyst along the upper pole of the right kidney, is slightly hyperdense, possibly representing proteinaceous material or blood products, although a solid lesion cannot be excluded without administration of IV contrast.
Scattered colonic diverticula without evidence of diverticulitis.
Mild prostatic enlargement.
Bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias.
Multilevel compression fractures in the thoracolumbar spine of indeterminate chronicity, status post kyphoplasty at two levels.
No associated soft tissue component is noted along the spine.
CARDIAC ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Mild to moderate ([**1-19**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations seen, but technical study quality precludes definite asssessment of valvular morphology.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 84 yo M with history of MM, DVT, admitted with hypotension and ARF.
He received volume resuscitation with 8 liters and subsequently developed bilateral pleural effusions.
He was briefly on bipap overnight for 5 minutes because patient appeared uncomfortable, but no clinical change.
A CT c/a/p showed bilateral renal cyst, for which he has urology f/u.
He denies pleuritic chest pain, palpitiations.
HYPOTENSION: Patient had mild fever and leukocytosis but no localizing symptoms.
Hypotension was originally fluid refractory but responded to steroids.
CT C/A/P showed no evidence of infection.
Most likely cause is mild viral vs. bacterial infection worse in setting of adrenal insufficiency.
No clear evidence of heart failure.
# HEMATURIA: Patient with hematuria along with bilateral renal cysts on CT scan.
ARF - likely prerenal azotemia.- Now resolved .
Multiple Myeloma - multiple myeloma for which he takes dexamethasone weekly on a regular basis.
Depression - continue citalopram.

We looked for signs of infection but did not observe any.
These symptoms were likely due to a viral infection in the setting of steroid use.
If you have fevers, chills, feel week or lightheaded, or have any other concerning symptoms.
