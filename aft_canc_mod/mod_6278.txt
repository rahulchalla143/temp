In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he was switched to Daptomycin from Vanco due to his history of VRE and also started on empiric C. Diff treatment with PO Vanco and IV Flagyl as well as continued on his Fusarium treatment.
TTE showed a small effusion.
CT Chest showed a bilateral, moderate on the right and small to moderate on the left pleural effusions, associated with bibasal consolidations.
Denies chest pain or shortness of breath.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologist History: Biphenotypic Leukemia - Initially prsented with "autoimmune pancytopenia" treated with steroids and IVIG.
Preliminary bone marrow biopsy was suspicious for a biphenotypic leukemia and therapy was initiated with hyperCVAD.
His day 14 marrow showed persistent disease and his regimen was changed to 7+3.
Day 14 and two subsequent marrows all continued to show persistent involvement with leukemia.
Further chemotherapy was held as he was found to have disseminated fusarium infection in the setting of prolonged neutropenia.
Other PMH: Disseminated Fusarium - [**5-14**] - treated with Ambisome and Voriconazole h/o hepatitis B - on lamivudine s/p appendectomy s/p umbilical hernia repair  Social History: Currently on disability.

There is accentuation of vascular markings and new bilateral pleural effusions and fluid tracking within the fissures.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with apparent superimposed interstitial edema.
Repeat radiography after appropriate diuresis is recommended to assess for underlying infection.
Increased bilateral pleural effusions, new moderate pericardial effusion, and new small volume ascites, all suggestive of fluid overload.
No evidence of colitis, intra-abdominal abscess, or other acute process toaccount for patient's pain and fever.
Stable splenomegaly and left renal cyst.
TTE [**2157-7-28**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the septum and mid-distal inferior/infero-lateral walls.

Mild to moderate ([**11-21**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is at least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

No evidence of vegetations or abscesses.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.

No definitive evidence of tamponade physiology, but correlation with echocardiography is required.
The amount of effusion appears to be slightly increased even compared to prior CT abdomen from less than 24 hours ago.
No focal consolidations within the upper lobes of the lungs noted.
Severe splenomegaly.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
There is brief right atrial diastolic invagination consistent with elevated intrapericardial pressure without overt tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-7-28**], no major change (no RV diastolic collapse was seen on review of the prior study).
IMPRESSION: Small, circumfirential pericardial effusion without overt echocardiographic tamponade.
Substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists with moderate residual pulmonary congestion.
Opacification at the right base medially most likely represents crowding of residually dilated pulmonary vessels.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.

No acute intra-abdominal process.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: 61M with active biphenotypic leukemia, neutropenia and disseminated fusarium infection admitted on [**7-27**] with fever and right-sided abdominal pain.
Biphenotypic Leukemia.
While in house, he was treated with a 10 day course of decitabine, which he tolerated without complications.
Neutropenic Fever.
Patient had neutropenic fever, in which all blood and urine cultures showed no growth and CT thorax showed no evidence of pneumonia or fungal infiltrate.
The patient had no diarrhea.
Daptomycin was discontinued when the patient was afebrile and transferred out of the ICU.
When patient remained afebrile for several days, he was switched to levofloxacin.
At time of discharge, he remained neutropenic and is expected to remain neutropenic for several days from decitabine treatment.
Pain in RLQ and RUQ was noted on admission to ICU and persisted on the floor.
LFTs remained normal throughout admission with the exception of persistently elevated alk phos; CT abd on admission showed no evidence of liver or biliary abnormality and normal colon.
RUQ US similarly did not show evidence of abnormality.
Patient stated pain in right abdomen increased with breathing and with movement, suggesting some type of diaphragmatic involvement.
Variation of abdominal pain with respiration suggested possible pleuritic component.
Pulmonary consult was obtained and did not believe there was a thoracic cause to patient's abd pain and did not believe a bronchoscopy would be useful as there was no clinical or radiological evidence of pneumonia.
Per radiology, however, phase of contrast could miss subtle liver lesions, thus it is still possible patient had mild tumor involvement of liver or liver capsule not picked up by imaging.
Abdominal pain resolved by its own on Day 5 if decitabine and remained stable until discharge.
A pericardial effusion was noted on TTE obtained shortly after admission.
Cadiology consult was obtained and daily TTEs were performed to monitor for tamponade physiology.
DDx included hypervolemia, malignant effusion, or pericarditis.
Effusion was not amenable to pericardiocentesis as patient had low platelet count.
Cardiology believed unless patient developed hemodynamic instability, no need to obtain pericardiocentesis.
Serial TTEs showed no evidence of tamponade for several days, thus cardiology recommended no further need to repeat daily TTEs.
# Hypervolemia.
The patient was fluid overloaded secondary to CHF (EF 45%), 1L NS boluses around ambisome infusions and later on, volume associated with chemotherapy.
Originally upon transfer to the floor, diuresis was held secondary to fear of lowering preload in the setting of pericardial effusion, but once this was deemed stable stable, patient was diuresed on 3 consecutive days with 20 IV lasix, and then remained euvolemic throughout the remainder of hospitalization.
Surface antibody + and core antibody + in [**Month (only) 116**].
Transitional Issues: The patient is set up to come to [**Hospital1 18**] oncology outpatient on a daily basis to get his ambisome infusions, labwork, and prn platelet and RBC transfusions.
Disp:*20 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Critical Care Systems  Discharge Diagnosis: Biphenotypic leukemia Pericardial effusion Disseminated fusarium infection   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted with fever and right-sided abdominal pain.
CT scan and expert consultation did not reveal a source of your abdominal pain, which resolved on its own.
