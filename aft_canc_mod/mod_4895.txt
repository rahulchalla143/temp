Patient states that he was [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7188**] today and developed a [**6-11**] headache which caused him to go to an OSH.
Once at the OSH he had a CT scan which revealed a L frontal lesion with significant edema.
His headache is located in the temporoparietal region and describes it as a sharp pain that is not relieved with pain medication.
He also reports intermittent blurred vision x 4 days, dizziness, and unsteadiness.
He denies any n/v or dysarthria.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
R arm tremor.
No pronator drift  Sensation: Intact to light touch Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger   Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS: [**2139-8-30**] 11:00PM   UREA N-14 CREAT-1.0 [**2139-8-30**] 11:00PM   estGFR-Using this [**2139-8-31**] 07:05AM BLOOD WBC-10.5 RBC-5.18 Hgb-14.3 Hct-42.3 MCV-82 MCH-27.6 MCHC-33.9 RDW-14.2 Plt Ct-224 [**2139-8-31**] 07:05AM BLOOD PT-11.8 PTT-22.5 INR(PT)-1.0 [**2139-8-31**] 07:05AM BLOOD Glucose-84 UreaN-17 Creat-1.0 Na-139 K-4.5 Cl-104 HCO3-29 AnGap-11  DISCHARGE LABS:  CT torso [**8-30**]: No metastatic disease  [**8-31**] MRI Head: Large heterogeneously enhancing lesion within the left frontal lobe, which causes significant mass effect, contralateral midline shift and FLAIR and T2 signal abnormality in most of the left frontal lobe.
The appearances are highly suggestive of a neoplasm like Oligodendroglioma or a GBM.
[**9-2**] Head CT: Post-left frontal craniectomy, with small amount of expected postoperative hemorrhage, pneumocephalus and overall decrease in degree of subfalcine herniation and compression of lateral ventricles.
[**9-3**] Head CT FINDINGS: Patient is status post left frontal craniotomy with partial excision of large left frontal mass.
There is stable appearance of hemorrhage, air, and residual mass in the postoperative site.
There is persistent rightward shift of normally midline structures of approximately 11.8 mm.
There is postoperative soft tissue swelling over the left frontoparietal bones.
[**9-3**] MRI brain FINDINGS: Since the prior MRI of [**2139-8-31**], there has been interval resection of the large right frontal mass.
There is subcutaneous emphysema and swelling of soft tissues along the left convexity.
There is pneumocephalus within the surgical cavity.
Signal intensity compatible with early subacute blood products are seen within the surgical cavity.
There has been interval decrease in the rightward shift from normally midline structures measuring 9 mm, previously 14 mm.
There has been slight interval improvement but persistent effacement of the left lateral ventricle.
On post-contrast images, there is subtle enhancement at the margins and slightly inferior to the surgical cavity (13:15-16).
Diffusion-weighted images demonstrate restricted diffusion at the margins of the surgical bed.
A small amount of fluid is seen in the left mastoid air cells.
Mild residual enhancement at the margins and slightly inferior to the surgical cavity.
No evidence of territorial infarct.
Brief Hospital Course: 43 y/o M presents to OSH with 3-4 weeks of frontotemporal headaches.
Head CT showed large frontal mass.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evaluation.
MRI head revealed a large mass with edema.
On [**9-2**] he went to the OR for a L frontal crani for resection of the mass.
The preliminary pathology was malignant metastatic tumor.
He tolerated the procedure well and went directly to the PACU, extubated.His SBP was less than 140 with a nipride drip.
He initially followed commands and had a non focal exam.
His post op head CT dmonstrated no acute post op hemorrhage.
His pain was well controlled.
Butalbital-Acetaminophen-Caff 50-325-40 mg Tablet Sig: [**1-3**] Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for headache.
Disp:*120 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: L frontal mass   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
