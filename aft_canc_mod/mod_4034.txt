Patient became obtunded/agitated in ED, was noted to have a large JVD and right arm edema.
CT scan of chest showed a large mediastinal mass that was impinging on her SVC.
Metastatic breast cancer: - noted RUE swelling in [**9-28**] - breast biopsy and the pathology showed infiltrating poorly differentiated carcinoma with invasion into skeletal muscles.
Family History: Mother was deceased at age 74 and she had diabetes and breast cancer (she had a mastectomy).
Her father is alive at age 89 and he has peripheral vascular disease.
Physical Exam: Vit:  97.7  111/57   104   26   98% RA Gen: middle aged woman, resting in bed, crying intermittently HEENT: PERRLA, EOMI CV: RRR, no MGR Pulm: rhonchi bilaterally anteriorly Abd: +BS, soft, NT, ND Ext: R UE erythematous and warm with pitting edema, no edema of other extremities.

No definite evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
A questionable density within the left frontal lobe on one image is incompletely evaluated and may relate to artifact.
CHEST CT: Compression of SVC.
Moderate to large size right pleural effusion layering posteriorly.
An underlying consolidation within the right lung cannot be excluded.
Right anterior mediastinal density, which may represent a mediastinal mass, is unchanged from [**2190-6-25**].
Right anterior mediastinal density is unchanged from the prior study and may represent a mediastinal mass.
Brief Hospital Course: 55 yo female s/p right mastectomy/xrt/chemo with diffusely metastatic CA (including carcinomatous meningitis by MRI) presents w/ MS changes and dehydration.
Pt's mental status and agitation initially improved with ativan.
She was initially started on antibiotics in view of recent chemothearapy and declining cell counts, cultures were drawn.
In addition, pt was found to have compression of her SVC, which she was started on IVF for.
Initially there was discussion regarding possibly tapping her pleural effusion as well as doing a spinal tap.
However, after discussion with family in view of her metastatic breast cancer resistant to treatment, it was decided that patient's care should focus on comfort and any further diagnostic test were discontinued.
