THE HSOD BAND IS A CONTROL FOR THE DETECTION OF NON-SPECIFIC REACTIVITY.
IT IS NOW KNOWN THAT THE HEPATITIS C VIRUS ( HCV) IS THE CAUSE OF MOST CASES OF NON-A, NON-B HEPATITIS ( NANBH).
IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE PATIENT [**Month (only) **] HAVE HEPATITIS C BUT LACK, OR NOT YET HAVE DEVELOPED (DUE TO EARLY INFECTION), OR HAVE RESOLVED AN ANTIBODY RESPONSE DETECTABLE BY THE ASSAYS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.
THE RIBA HCV 3.0 STRIP IMMUNOBLOT ASSAY (SIA) IS LIMITED TO THE DETECTION OF ANTI-HCV IN HUMAN SERUM AND PLASMA.
THE PRESENCE OF ANTI-HCV IS INDICATIVE OF PAST OR PRESENT INFECTION BY THE HEPATITIS C VIRUS, BUT DOES NOT ALWAYS NECESSARILY CONSTITUTE A DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSIS.
A PATIENT SPECIMEN THAT HAS TESTED REACTIVE BY A LICENSED ANTI-HCV SCREENING PROCEDURE THAT IS FOUND TO BE NEGATIVE BY RIBA HCV 3.0 SIA DOES NOT EXCLUDE THE PATIENT FROM THE POSSIBILITY OF INFECTION WITH HCV.
<br> Peritoneal Fluid ([**10-13**]) - NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
<br> Bile Duct Stent ([**10-13**]) - SUSPICIOUS for malignant cells.
<br> <b>Studies:</b> CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2167-10-26**] 3:28 PM CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Lung bases demonstrate mild atelectasis.
The liver is without focal lesions.
Pneumobilia and intrahepatic billiary dilatation is unchanged.
Spleen is mildly enlarged at 13.7 cm.
The area of hypoattenuation, which was seen to be surrounding the stent in the head of the pancreas is now no longer seen as it is now occupied by a larger metallic Wallstent and thus the previous findings are most likely related to a very dilated common bile duct.
Pancreatic ductal dilataton is minimally increased and measures up to 8 mm and can be followed to its insertion into the common bile duct distally.
In this region, there is no evidence of mass.
Multiple prominent lymph nodes are seen within the retroperitoneum and in the peripancreatic region which are unchanged and do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Intra- abdominal loops of large and small bowel maintain a normal caliber without evidence of obstruction.
No intraperitoneal free air is identified.
Large amount of free fluid is identified within the pelvis.
No lymphadenopathy is evident.
BONE WINDOWS AND SOFT TISSUES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is identified.
Diffuse anasarca is noted.
Status post replacement of previously noted plastic biliary stent with a metallic Wallstent.
The previosly described abnormal hypodensity around the plastic biliary stent is no longer apparent as the space is now occupied by a larger metallic stent and thus the findings on the prior exam is most likely attributable to a focally dilated common bile duct.
Extensive ascites throughout the abdomen and pelvis, unchanged.
Cannulation and opacification of the biliary duct is seen.
Small filling defects within the lower common bile duct are noted may represent stones.
IMPRESSION: Successful ERCP with extraction of CBD stones and metal stent placement across the lower CBD stricture.
Liver is heterogeneous in echotexture, likely representing cirrhosis, with atrophic right lobe and pneumobilia as seen on the CT study.
No intrahepatic ductal dilatation is noted except for pneumobilia.
No definitive focal liver lesion is identified.
IMPRESSION: Heterogeneous echogenicity of the liver representing cirrhosis with pneumobilia and large ascites.
The evaluation of the pancreas is extremely limited, and please refer to the official report of CT scan for the pancreatic finding.
<br> CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2167-10-13**] 2:57 PM CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.
There is massive ascites throughout the abdomen.
The liver is without focal lesions.
Pneumobilia is noted from prior stent placement.
The spleen is mildly enlarged at 13.6 cm.
This appears to have some ring enhancement and possibly represents a very dilated common bile duct containing the stent in its center.
In this region, there is no evidence for a mass.
In both kidneys, there are subcentimeter hypodense lesions which are too small to characterize but likely represent simple cysts.
There are small lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum in the paraaortic region that do not meet criteria for pathologic enlargement.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Again noted is massive ascites throughout the pelvis.
Small and large bowel loops are normal other than diverticula in the sigmoid colon.
There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy.
On bone windows, there is a hemangioma in the vertebral body of L3.
No concerning osteolytic or osteosclerotic lesions are seen.
Abnormality in the head of the pancreas likely represents a focally dilated common bile duct filled with sludge.
A short interval followup CT possibly after stent removal is recommended to exclude a pancreatic mass.
Extensive ascites throughout the abdomen and pelvis and small bilateral pleural effusions as well as anasarca could be related to CHF.
There are tiny R waves in the inferior leads consistent with possible prior inferior myocardial infarction.
There is a late transition with anterolateral ST-T wave changes consistent with prior anterior myocardial infarction.
Non-specific lateral ST-T wave changes.
Low voltage.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Cannulation and opacification of the biliary tree demonstrate a dilated common bile duct with multiple filling defects in the lower portion.
IMPRESSION: Successful ERCP with replacement of a biliary stent.
Dilated CBD with multiple filling defects likely represent stones.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an 80 year old woman with likely biliary cancer, biliary obstruction s/p stenting presenting with cholangitis.
Initially admitted to MICU due to hypotension.
# Cholangitis Underwent an initial ERCP as above with placement of a plastic stent.
Initial cytology from stent raised suspicion of adenocarcinoma in the biliary tree.
The patient was about to have the repeat procedure when she refused due to discomfort.
During the repeat ERCP (see above for report) the patient was found to have a malignant-appearing stricture in the distal CBD.
Cytology from the ampulla was sent and showed an adeoncarcinoma.
Likely related to cholangitis discussed above.
# Biliary Adenocarcinoma Cytology above showed evidence of an adenocarcinoma of the biliary tree.
Initial CT scan raised the suspicion of a pancreatic mass, however this was not seen in repeat CT scan after metal stent was placed.
# Cirrhosis/Ascites She had significant ascites on exam and imaging.
At time she appeared to have some element of confusion and was noted to have asterixis on exam c/w hepatic encephalopathy.
# CAD: No current symptoms with non-specific changes on EKG.
Cardiac enzymes negative for acute ischemia.
She was not maintained on a beta blocker due to her low blood pressure.
Prior to discharge had slight discomfort with neuropathic pain when eating.
# Dispo - she was seen by physical therapy who clared her for return back to her [**Hospital3 **] facility with services in place.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with an infection of your bile ducts.
You also have cirrhosis of your liver with a resulting fluid accumulation (ascites) in your belly.
He can arrange for you to see a gastroenterologist (liver doctor) so that you can continue to have fluid drained from your belly as you need it.
He can also arrange for you to see an oncologist if necessary regarding the possible cancer of your bile ducts.
Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you have increasing belly pain, nausea, fevers, chest pain, or shortness of breath.
