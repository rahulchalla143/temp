[**2129-12-20**] - Cardiac Catheterization   History of Present Illness: 74 yo male with history of CAD (3 BMS in [**2119**]) who presented to PCP office today complaining of exertional/rest/post-prandial epigastric chest pain/tightness for the past 3 weeks.
The pain has been progressive and now occurs at rest and reminds him of his chest pain 10 yrs ago.
He restarted it 1.5 weeks ago when recurrent chest pain, orinally intermittent and associated with exertion describes as exertional.
At 5am today chest pain awoke from sleep.
This morning, pt reports chest pain which awoke him from sleep.
In cath lab, pt was found to have mid 80% LAD, 60%OM1, distal 90%RCA, mid RCA stent with some in-stent restenosis, no interventions occured.
On arrival to the floor, patient had no complaints and reported tolerating the procedure well.
CARDIAC HISTORY: CAD s/p 3 BMS in [**2119**] (LCX/OM and RCA) -CABG:None -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: [**2119**] (see above) 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -BPH, -asthma -Asbestos exposure (with possible scar tissue) -hematuria past 3 weeks with newly diagnosed bladder tumor that is tentatively scheduled for resection on [**2130-1-13**]   Social History: From NH.
2 kids, 8 grandkids  Family History: Father Died of MI at 58.
Paternal uncle died  of MI at 60.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Right radial artery with occlusive band in place, no hematoma.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+   Pertinent Results: See below EKG: [**12-20**] at 3pm: NSR HR 65, PR 150, QRS<120, NA, NI, No ST or TW changes.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**2129-12-21**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is probable mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the basal inferior wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Possible basal inferior wall motion abnormality with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.
No pathologic valvular disease.
ETT: [**2123-12-13**] INTERPRETATION: This 68 year old man with a history of CAD was referred to the lab for evaluation.
No arm, neck, back or chest discomfort was reported by the patient throughout the study.
At peak exercise, there was 0.5-1 mm upsloping ST segment depression in V4-6.
IMPRESSION: Borderline ischemic EKG changes in the absence of anginal type symptoms.
Coronary arteriography in this right dominant system revealed two-vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA was long and had mild plaquing.
The LAD was a long vessel that wrapped around the apex with a proximal 30% stenosis after the first septal perforator and before the first diagonal branch.
The left circumflex artery had a proximal calcified plaque with 70% stenosis extending into the major OM2 which contained a 90% stenosis at the origin of the small superior pole.
The RCA had a mid-vessel 80% stenosis just beyond the acute marginal and a 60% stenosis just before the r-PDA.
Overall, there was diffuse disease along the entire length of the RCA.
No mitral regurgitation was seen.
Successful PTCA and stenting of RCA was performed without residual stenosis, TIMI 2 fast flow into 2 jailed acute marginal branches, and no angiographically-apparent dissection (see PTCA comments).
Normal left ventricular systolic and diastolic function.

Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.
Subsequent bilateral areas of basal atelectasis.
Moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of pulmonary edema.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
A urology consult was obtained given his known bladder tumor.
Although there was some risk of bleeding associated with the tumor, it was recommended that he proceed with revascularization.
He was noted to have leukocytosis however no fever or signs of infection were noted.
He had a CTU of the abdomen and pelvis on the day of discharge and will need a BUN/creatinine drawn on Mon.
