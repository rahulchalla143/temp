Admission Date:  [**2149-4-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-4-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2081-2-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Right-sided temporal lobe lesion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Microscopic dissection.
Transcortical/transtemporal tumor debulking and     resection.
The patient has a history of non-small cell lung CA and had previously been whole brain radiated for several intracranial lesions.
The patient has now developed a new right temporal lobe lesion concerning for recurrent metastasis.
Past Medical History: She does not have diabetes, hypertension, or COPD.
Family History: Her mother died of an unspecified cancer while her father passed away from a heart attack.
She has 11 siblings and 3 of them are alive; a sister died of ovarian cancer, another sister died of breast cancer, and a brother died of an unspecified typed of cancer.
Her extremities do not show clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
There is no right-left confusion or finger agnosia.
Extraocular movements are full; there is no nsytagmus.
Motor Examination:  She does not have a drift.
She does not have a Romberg.
Linear high-attenuation material seen within the right sylvian fissure and several parietal sulci consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Small amount of hemorrhage is seen layering in the posterior occipital horns.
There is mild edema at the operative site with 3 mm leftward shift of normally midline structures.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus or infarction.
There is swelling and mild subcutaneous emphysema involving the tissues overlying the craniotomy site.
Status post resection of temporal lobe lesion with post-operative changes including pneumocephalus, mild edema and mass effect and subarachnoid blood.
No evidence of hydrocephalus or effacement of the basal cisterns.
5-mm rounded focus of hyperdensity in the right parietal operculum which may represent hemorrhage within an enhancing lesion seen within this region on MR study performed earlier the same date.
FINDINGS: There is an enhancing lesion in the inferior right frontal lobe which is irregular in contour and has a less enhancing center.
There is an additional small enhancing focus in the right frontal operculum.
This is very small and does not appear to be associated with significant mass effect at the present time.
No additional abnormal contrast enhancing lesions are identified.
There appears to be some generalized alteration in density on the T1-weighted sequence of the white matter in the centrum semiovale regions.
This could reflect some edema or could be secondary to prior therapy.
SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: RIGHT TEMPORAL TUMOR #1, RIGHT TEMPORAL TUMOR #2.
DIAGNOSIS: #1, RIGHT TEMPORAL TUMOR RESECTION (including intraoperative smear #1): METASTATIC POORLY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA.
#2, RIGHT TEMPORAL TUMOR RESECTION (including intraoperative smear #2): METASTATIC POORLY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2149-4-11**] 7:20 PM CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with status post surgery, rule out residual lesion.
FINDINGS: There are craniotomy defects identified in the right temporal and parietal regions for resection of previously noted enhancing lesions in the temporal and parietal lobes.
There are blood products seen in the right temporal lobe with increased signal along the margin of the surgical cavity on diffusion images due to postsurgical change.
There is no hydrocephalus or midline shift.
Diffuse hyperintensities in the white matter could be related to previous radiation/chemotherapy.
Blood products and postsurgical changes are seen in this region.
No evidence of hydrocephalus or midline shift.
On POD 1 she also had a repeat MRI of the head to look for residual tumor which did show some residual enhancement.
Also due to her continued dysarthria it was decided that the decadron would be not be tapered to 2 mg po BID but instead stay at 3 mg PO TID.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right-sided temporal lobe lesion   Discharge Condition: Neurologically Stable.
