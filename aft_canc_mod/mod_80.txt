DIAGNOSIS: CARDIAC MUSCLE AND FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE WITH FIBRIN DEPOSITION AND GRANULATION TISSUE REACTION.
Note: H&E sections (B through E) reveal fibrous tissue with abundant geographic necrosis and infiltration by an atypical lymphoid population in an invasive and reticulated growth pattern with delicate interstitial fibrosis.
The tumor cells are large with moderately abundant amphophilic cytoplasm.
The nuclei have pale chromatin, irregular and angulated nuclear contours, and small inconspicuous nucleoli.
The tumor is negative for CD10, CD15, and CD56, which shows only rare scattered positive cells.
The combined clinical, morphologic, and immunophenotypic findings are most consistent with the diagnosis of primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma.
Erythrocytes are decreased, with mild anisopoikilocytosis including occasional echinocytes, and rare target cells.
Erythroid precursors are relatively proportionately decreased in number and exhibit overall normoblastic maturation with rare cells with irregular contours.
Abnormal forms are not seen.
It consists of a 1.1 cm core biopsy of trabecular marrow with a cellularity of 70%.
The bone appears mildly osteopenic.
Megakaryocytes are increased in number, with focal loose and tight clustering.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
This could represent an acoustically dense epicardial fat pad or an extensive epicardial tumor/metastasis.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with depressed free wall contractility.
There is a large pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
Abnormal septal motion, likely due to effusive-constrictive physiology (commonly seen for a limited time after pericadiocentesis).
Mediastinal mass abutting the right ventricular free wall.
No evidence of tamponade physiology.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There is a mediastinal mass compressing the heart.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of significant pericardial fluid or tamponade physiology.
Mediastinal mass anterior to the right ventricle.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 45 year f with past medical history of hypothyroidisim presenting with diaphoresis, presyncope, and severe DOE and found to have an anterior medialstinal mass  consistnet with Primary Mediastinal Large B- Cell Lymphoma on pathology, transfered from CCU after pericardial window and resolution of tamponade to BMT service for intiation of R-[**Hospital1 **]  #Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma- The patient presneted with dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain.
A CT chest done as part of her evaluation was notable for a anterior mediastinal mass.
Biopsy of the pericardium and mediastinal mass was positve for B-cell lymphoma.
The patient experienced an adverse reaction during infusion of rituxan ( see below), but tolerated the remainder of her treatment course without complication.
# Afib w/ RVR- the patient triggered twice during infusion of rituxan on Day 1 of R-CHOP.
The patient was found to be in afib with RVR ( Hrs 130s-150s) on telemetry ( confirmed by EKG).
The patient convereted to NSR HR in he 80s with out any intevention, and resolution of palpitation.
The BMT atending was notified and the decision wasmade to restart Rituxan at 0mg/hr,and if an further complications would stop completely.
An echo was done the next morning, significant for an LVEF > 55%.
Her afib was most likley a exaggerated inflammatory reaction to Rituxan.
?She had no further episodes during her hospital course  # Pulmonary Embolism- The patient was found to have a right subsegmental PE and on CTA.
# pericardial effusion/tamponade-  The patient  most likely had a malignant effusion secondary to her Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma.
Pericardial drain was pulled on [**9-21**] and f/u echo showed resolution of pericardial effusion.
# Urinary tract infection- The patient noted to have hematuria.
should be removed on [**10-2**]   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis Primary Mediastinal large b cell lymphoma Pulmonary embolism/deep venous thromboembolism  Secondary Diagnosis Hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were found to have a  cancer in your chest ( Primary Mediastinal large b cell lymphoma) and a blood clot in your lungs ( Pulmonary Embolism).
You were also found to have a clot at the site of your PICC line, and the line was ultimately removed.
