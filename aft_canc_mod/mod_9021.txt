He had an upper GI series with small bowel followthrough done [**1-19**], which showed a prolonged transit time of about seven hours with some dilated small bowel loops, but no definite evidence of a fistula at that time.
Over the next few weeks, Mr. [**Known lastname **] then developed intermittent abdominal distention and cramping alternating with diarrhea.
He had occasional bouts of emesis with this.
He additionally, over the time course, developed acute renal failure with rising creatinine to 2.9.
The TPN was restarted and he underwent colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy, both of which showed nonspecific friability and ulcerations with erythematous areas.
He also underwent a barium enema, which showed a pattern in the distal sigmoid colon and distal small bowel consistent with a functional ileus, but no evidence of obstruction.
Due to the patient's inability to tolerate p.o., a GI consultation was obtained with recommendations made for MRI and MRA to rule out venous thrombosis.
This was performed [**2-12**], which again showed mild-to-moderate dilated bowel proximal and distal to the anastomosis consistent with an ileus.
There was no venous thrombosis demonstrated on this study.
There was, however, seen an abnormal area of soft tissue enhancement, which could possibly represent some localized ischemia.
The patient remained stable, however, on [**2-15**], it was found on physical examination that his midline abdominal wound had again dehisced with exposed bowel and a serosal tear representing a new small-bowel fistula.
At this point it was decided that he had failed nonoperative management.
He was taken to the operating room [**2105-2-18**], at which time he underwent an exploratory laparotomy with takedown of enterocutaneous fistula, lysis of adhesions, revision of the enterosigmoid colostomy, small bowel resection, and a component separation ventral herniorrhaphy under general endotracheal anesthesia.
He had good urine output throughout the case, however, towards the end he became mildly acidotic.
The ICU course was complicated by hypotension requiring pressors, high blood sugars requiring an insulin drip.
Chest x-ray was consistent with likely left lower lobe pneumonia.
Blood cultures grew out coagulase negative staph.
Sputum grew out yeast and gram-negative rods.
Repeat sputum cultures grew out Klebsiella oxytoca, which was pansensitive.
On postoperative day #6, he was noted to have necrosis along the incision line and wound breakdown.
[**Name (NI) **] remained in the ICU, however, for further management secondary to altered mental status, which slowly improved.
He continued to have copious secretions.
He had a repeat abdominal CT scan [**3-4**], to evaluate for intra-abdominal abscess.
There were a few small fluid collections visualized, however, no definite abscesses were identified.
On postoperative day #19, the patient complained of dull, left-sided chest pain at rest.
The pain was relieved with nitroglycerin.
The patient had no further episodes of chest pain throughout his hospitalization.
It was felt that this was due to acute renal failure.
He underwent renal ultrasonography on the [**2105-3-14**], which showed normal kidneys, no evidence of hydronephrosis, stones, or masses.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  (review by systems)  NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient initially suffered from depression during his early hospitalization based on psychiatry recommendations from consultation obtained [**2104-12-12**].
Based on the further recommendations from the Department of Psychiatry, he was maintained on Remeron and Ritalin to help manage his depression and attentiveness.
He had periods of confusion postoperatively after extubation in the ICU, which spontaneously resolved.
However, due to likely sepsis, postoperatively, he had significant pressor requirements, which were eventually weaned.
He also had one episode of left dull chest pain for which he was ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  As per above, after a prolonged course of the NPO with intermittent abdominal pain, distention, the patient is able to tolerate some PO intake, which is limited by a feeling of early satiety and intermittent distention, relieved by bowel movements.
He underwent upper series with small bowel followthrough [**2105-3-17**], which again showed a delayed transit time, but no mechanical obstruction.
The patient was noted to have copious diarrhea, question of bacterial overgrowth was raised.
GENITOURINARY:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] suffered from acute renal failure.
Renal consultation was obtained and thought was that this may be ATN secondary to a hypotensive episode.
He has also had difficulty with urinary retention requiring multiple Foley catheter insertions.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient initially required an insulin drip immediately postoperative for management of high blood glucose while on TPN.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Initially, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was afebrile, however, he developed pneumonia postoperatively, growing Klebsiella oxytoca and gram-positive bacteria, further identified as coagulase-positive staph.
However, he continued to have an elevated white blood cell and low-grade temperatures.
Urine culture, from [**3-8**], grew Enterococcus and yeast, for which she was treated with a full course of Ampicillin.
WOUND:  After the patient's initial fistula closed with development of the new fistula, as stated above, postoperatively the incision underwent extensive flap necrosis and breakdown.
Wet-to-dry dressing changes.
The wound progressively began to granulate in and currently has beefy red, healthy granulation tissue with a few areas of fibrinoid.
The wound is clean and there is no exudate or drain.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) 6719**], after undergoing an extensive hospitalization, is stable and in good condition for discharge to a rehabilitation facility to further convalesce.
He is afebrile with a normal white blood cell count.
