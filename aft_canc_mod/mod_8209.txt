He [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy which were negative, followed by a RUL wedge resection  [**2154-12-30**] with path returning as a 2.6 cm well to moderate differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma , neg nodes, clear margins.
He has had a persistent density 3.5 cm in lateral RUL since surgery, now denser and FDG avid.
His FNA ([**2155-8-12**]) was nondiagnostic with occas groups of large atypical cells thought to be glandular in nature or reactive.
He is short of breath walking down the [**Doctor Last Name **] and is at most able to climb one flight of stairs with significant dyspnea.
PET is negative for metastatic disease.

Lung Cancer Synopsis Staging according to American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual -- 7th Edition, [**2152**]   MACROSCOPIC  Specimen Type:  Lobectomy.
EXTENT OF INVASION  Primary Tumor:  pT3:  Tumor >7 cm or of any size that directly invades any of the following: chest wall, diaphragm, mediastinal pleura, parietal pericardium; or tumor of any size in the main bronchus less than 2 cm distal to the carina but without involvement of the carina; or tumor of any size associated atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis of the entire lung; or tumor of any size with separate tumor nodule(s) in same lobe.
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN1:  Metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes, including intrapulmonary nodes involved by direct extension of the primary tumor.
Other than on the previous examination, no overt pneumothorax is seen on today's examination.
Whereas the left lung appears normal, the post-operative right lung is substantially decreased in size after lobectomy and evidence of post-surgical parenchymal opacities.
Moderate elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
No larger pleural effusion.
CXR [**2155-9-21**] A small apical pneumothorax is present.
There is no central pulmonary embolism, but the exam is not diagnostic distally.
There is no acute aortic syndrome.
Patient with recent right upper lobe lobectomy with residual small pleural effusion and small-to-moderate pneumothorax.
Bilateral, more prominent on the left side independent portioned ground-glass opacities around severe emphysema is mostly compatible with pulmonary edema as seen in previous chest x-rays.
Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged.
Right apical small pneumothorax is stable.
Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
There are no new lung abnormalities.
CXR [**2155-9-24**] In comparison with study of earlier in this date, there is some increase in the degree of right upper lung pneumothorax.
CXR [**2155-9-28**] Mild interstitial edema is unchanged.
Small right pneumothorax is stable.
Small amount of right pleural effusion is also unchanged.
Postoperative changes in the right perihilar region are again noted.
There are no new lung abnormalities.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 112101**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a right upper lobectomy for recurrent NSCLC on [**2155-9-17**].
However, he had to be reintubated in the OR due to respiratory distress and was put on a neo drip for hypotension.
On POD #2, he started his epidural for pain control, and started on a clear liquid diet, which he tolerated well.
On POD #5 he [**Month/Day/Year 1834**] a clamp trial, which showed no increased pneumothorax on chest xray.
However, later that day, he desaturated on the floor, was tachycardic to the 130s, had increasing anxiety and pain, and was transferred to the ICU for concern for PE and increased confusion.
A CTA was obtained which showed no evidence of a PE.
On POD #6, he continued to have some residual agitation and confusion in the morning, which resolved by the afternoon.
Due to concern for fluid overload and pulmonary edema, he was given lasix 20 IV twice.
He had some shortness of breath in the afternoon requiring CPAP.
He continued to have an oxygen requirement at 3-4L and congestion on chest xray.
