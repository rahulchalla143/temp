MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]: Upon detailed analysis of the FLAIR images, comparison with the prior study shows slightly less extensive appearance of a semicircular area of heterogeneously diminished FLAIR signal in its central portion seen along theanteromedial border of the principal tumor mass.
Lastly, there is a moderate-sized air-fluid level within the left sphenoid air cell with moderate mucosal thickening.
This finding could relate to prior intubation or potentially be inflammatory in origin, as fluid levels were seen on the prior study within both sphenoid air cells on [**2197-7-22**].
There is also prominent high T2 signal within the mastoid sinuses, which again could relate to prior intubation or be inflammatory in origin.
No mitotic figures are identified in the above blocks.
No necrosis or vascular proliferation is present.
The available tissue lacks satisfactory pathology that would explain the enhancement in the neuroimaging, which suggests the enhancing areas were not sampled.
***NOTE: These immunostaining results confirm the sampled tumor is a glioma with a low proliferative potential.
The staining features in #11 are more suggestive of a grade 2 astrocytoma while those in #4 are more suggestive of a grade 2 oligodendroglioma.
The tumor should be considered a grade 2 out of 4 infiltrating glioma with low proliferative potential   Brief Hospital Course: On arrival to the [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to be septic with a temperature of 104, blood pressure of 76/59, and was given a total of 11L IV fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
He was also loaded with Dilantin, given IV Ativan and Valium for continued seizures.
He had left arm and left leg as well as left deviation throughout examination.
He was transferred to the MICU where he was loaded with phenobarbital and given propofol for continued evidence of seizures.
He was monitored by bedside EEG and finally around 5:00 p.m. on [**7-20**] he stopped having electrographic seizures.
Pt had initially required pressors for BP support in the ICU and remained intubated for respiratory failure and pulmonary edema.
He was monitored by EEG on [**7-22**] with showed no evidence of any more epileptiform activity.
MRI was done on [**7-22**] and showed a right frontal lobe lesion with small areas of enhancement in the anterior and posterior area suggestive of neoplasm.
Weight based heparin was started for treatment of PE and therefore, surgery was delayed.
Pt then had recurrence of fever while intubated and was treated with a full course of antibiotics for presumed ventilator associated pneumonia.
Pathology showed a diffusely infiltrating Astrocytoma grade 2.
After diuresis and resolution of pulmonary edema/pneumonia, the patient was extubated on [**8-9**].
EEG on [**8-10**] showed no signs of continued seizure.
He has been weaned from facetent and has been sating 99% on room air without any continued evidence of pulm edema.
Pt passed his swallow study on [**8-14**], NG tube was removed and he has been eating well since with no need for supplemental nutrition.
Pt was restarted on Lovenox sc BID for ongoing treatment of PE and was restarted on most of his pre-admission medications.
Nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: One (1) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for oral exudate.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed: for severe pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Brain Tumor  Secondary: Dyslipidemia TG [**2190**] Type II DM Macular degeneration HTN Kidney stone Gastritis Cervical spondylosis Colonic polyp Gout   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after having a seizure that went on for some time and was difficult to stop.
You were in the intensive care unit and had some complications of having a breathing tube but these have all resolved.
It was discovered that you have a mass in your brain that is being followed by neuro surgeons.
If you experience any chest pain, severe headache, shortness of breath, recurrent seizures or any other general worsening of condition you should return to the ED immediately.
