Past Medical History: Past Medical History: CAD s/p stents x3,  11 yrs ago per pt HTN AAA, no surgery polyp diverticulitis GERD Hyperlipidemia Metastatic NSCLC Squamouse cell diagnosed [**2161-2-27**]  PSH: s/p appy  Onc Hx: 65 yrs.
man with heavy smoking history, CAD s/p stents, HTN and hyperlipidemia presented with cough with blood tinged sputum, leukocytosis and weight loss at the beginning of [**Month (only) **] [**2161**].
CXR on [**2161-1-23**] showed RLL infiltrates and he was treated with Levaquin for pneumonia.
CT c/a/p on [**2160-2-14**] at [**Location (un) 2274**] showed a 3.5 cm right infrahilar abnormal soft tissue density appearing necrotic  and with central cavity which extends along the pleural surface medially into the right middle lobe.
CT also showed a 4.9cm enlarged left adrenal gland compatible with metastatic lesion, possibly necrotic given its low density.
Infiltration of the surrounding fat and small nodules suggest metastatic spread from  the adrenal gland.
His pain increased to [**10-21**] on [**2-16**] and  he was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for pain control and to expedite the work up.
CTA and CT a/p at [**Hospital1 18**] did not show PE but emphysema.
CT also showed a cavitating pulmonary mass adjacent to the pericardium within the right medial lower lobe; Mediastinal and bihilar lymphadenopathy; an enlarged left adrenal gland.
PET CT demonstrated FDG-avid lesions in the right lung, bilateral mediastinal LN's, left adrenal, right 11th rib and T-spine (T8, T11), all c/w with a primary lung cancer with metastatic disease.
He underwent a EUS by the Advanced Endoscopy/ERCP service with EUS-biopsy of the left adrenal mass and subcarinal LN on [**2-18**], with samples returning non-diagnostic.
Of note, during this procedure, he had an episode of SVT and brief hypotension requiring IV pressor therapy.
Thoracic Surgery was consulted to evaluate for possible VATS or mediastinoscopy, however, Thoracic  Surgery recommended to continue with less invasive measures first, and recommended a CT-guided biopsy of the left adrenal mass.
The path shows squamous cell carcinoma, consistent with lung primary.
He has CTA that is negative for PE and was kept on DVT prophylaxis.
He does have long smoking history and imaging suggests a component of COPD, but he had no active wheeze.
No clear infiltrate on chest x-ray other than right-sided lung mass.
Felt to be likely due to a combination of his right lung mass and also splinting from his metastatic bone pain that prevents him from taking deep breaths.
He was initially discharged, but then readmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-5**] with dehydration and right chest/flank pain.
He has a metastatic lesion at T10, and pain was felt to be radicular.
CTA  in ED showed no pulmonary embolus.
He received chemotherapy with carboplatin, AUC 5, on [**3-7**], (day 1) and gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2, day 1 and d8, ([**3-14**]), without difficulty.
Metoprolol was started after an episode of AF with rapid ventricular response.

Right lung pneumonia, most severe in the lower lobe, with small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Continued followup with radiographs is recommended to assess for resolution.
Right paramediastinal mass is similar in size to [**9-16**], [**2161**].
Left adrenal gland nodule and right eleventh rib sclerotic lesion, similar in size to prior, were characterized on PET-CT as metastases.
Small pericardial effusion, minimally enlarged since [**7-26**], [**2161**], without evidence of tamponade.
Severe diffuse centrilobular emphysema.
CXR [**2161-9-23**]: IMPRESSION:  Right upper lobe pneumonia with equivocal involvement of lower and middle lobes with small accompanying parapneumonic effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Brief Course: 66 YM with Hx CAD s/p stents, emphysema, HTN and hyperlipidemia, stage 4 squamous cell lung cancer with bone and adrenal mets presented to the emergency room with dyspnea and hypoxia and found to have right-sided pneumonia.
#AMS: Most likely to be secondary to toxic metabolic encephalopathy in setting of infection.
However, in the setting of his metastatic cancer, mets to the brain were also possible.
#Tachycardia: Suspected due to infection and resolved with IV fluids.
S/p 2 cycles of Taxotere maintenance treatment, last on [**8-10**], was held in house given that he developed fatigue and dehydration after chemo.
Last MRI L spine showed possibility of leptomeningeal disease.
#?Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear why pt was on dexamethasone, possibly has h/o AI given mets to adrenals but unclear.
#CAD: There were no clear ST changes on EKG.
Troponin not elevated and chest pain seemed most likely pleuritic.
#Anemia: Normocytic, chronic, likely related to his chemotherapy.
