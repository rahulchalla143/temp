Admission Date:  [**2144-9-23**]       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2095-7-17**]       Sex:  F  Service:  OMED  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 44-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer diagnosed on [**1-/2139**] status post left mastectomy, 19/21 positive lymph nodes, status post four cycles of CAF and subsequent autologous BMT in [**2138**] which was unsuccessful.
Since that time, the patient has had slowly progressive disease with pathological fractures in the ribs, the pelvic rami, and concurrently being treated with monthly treatments of Zometa.
On admission, the patient was found to be incidentally pancytopenic and also had a subacute left parietal subdural hematoma without a midline shift.
No enhancing lesions were noted.
The patient did not have neurologic symptoms at the time of presentation and was evaluated by Neurosurgery in the Emergency Department.
The patient was found to be neurologically stable without increasing subdural hematoma based on MRI on [**2144-9-26**].
The patient's chief complaint of dizziness had resolved after adequate hydration in the ICU.
During the hospital stay in the ICU, the patient received a Porta-Cath for permanent intravascular access with the right internal jugular for temporary access.
The patient has metastatic disease to bone.
Osteoblastic metastatic lesions in the pelvis and acetabula bilaterally.
Status post high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue in [**2138**].
There was no visible thrush, lesions, mucous membranes were moist.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.
There was visible left mastectomy with scars.
Abdomen:  No splenomegaly.
No hepatomegaly, nontender, nondistended, no masses appreciated, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities: There was no edema, +2 pulses dorsalis pedis bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Oncology Service to monitor her pancytopenia and neurologic examination for her subdural hematoma.
Because of the subdural hematoma, the patient's platelet level was kept around 100.
The cause of the pancytopenia was unclear.
It was unlikely due to bleeding as there is no obvious source of bleeding, unlikely to be hemolysis.
Biopsies showed extensive breast tissue within the marrow confirming infiltration.
She had no focal neurologic deficits.
CT examinations showed no increase in interval changes.
On [**2144-10-2**], the patient complained of some mild blurry vision in the right eye.
Ophthalmology was consulted and examination was performed which showed bilateral papilledema and small hemorrhage in the left optic disk.
There was concern that the patient had increased intracranial pressure.
MRI with gadolinium scan was performed to evaluate for possible increasing subdural hematoma versus emergence of a new intracranial metastasis.
The results of the MRI were unchanged from previous showing no parenchymal metastasis but involvement of the bone of the skull.
There was no evidence of herniation or increased intracranial pressure.
On hospital day number six, the patient began to develop fevers of 100.8 which progressed to lows of 100.2.
The source of fever was unclear.
The patient had no complaints or localizing source of infection.
Antibiotics were not given as the patient looked clinically stable and no obvious source of infection could be elucidated.
A CT scan of the torso and sinuses were performed which did not show abscesses or signs of infection.
To the time of this dictation, cultures have been negative or show contamination.
The patient's pain initially prior to admission was managed with NSAIDs; however, given her subdural hematoma and thrombocytopenia, all NSAIDs were discontinued upon her admission.
Her pain was controlled with opiates.
The pain was managed unsuccessfully with Percocet; however, the pain was well controlled after administration of Fentanyl at 50 micrograms per hour.
The elevated LDH possibly was secondary to hemolysis.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed which showed no evidence of ductal dilatation.
CT scan of the torso also did not show evidence of ductal dilatation.
