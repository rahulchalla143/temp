Admission Date:  [**2182-2-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2182-3-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2100-10-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Lipitor / Prozac / sertraline  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**] Chief Complaint: leg weakness, back pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracic laminectomies and fusion   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 7168**] is an 81 year old woman with history of multiple myeloma, chronic renal insufficiency, T10-T11 lesion with cord compression, admitted from nursing home for elective surgery.
X-rays and MRI revealed a pathological fracture of her thoracic spine, given TLSO and after serial MRIs showed worsening fracture.
Multiple Myeloma diagnosis was made in [**2178**], treated with radiotherapy, but noted in the past month to have progressive neurologic decline with lower extremity weakness and difficulty with walking.
MRI showed T10-T11 lesion with severe fracture and anterior wedging with near collapse of T11, resulting in cord compression.
Patient did not tolerate TLSO brace well, and lower extremity weakness progressed to significantly decreased proximal muscle strength with some decreased distal strength as well.
Spinal cord edema was noted on repeat MRI, and patient was started on dexamethasone.
Urine culture showed E. Coli >100,000 which was resistant to ampicillin/sulbactam, cefoxitin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin; cultures were sensitive to bactrim, ceftazidime, cefepime, gentamicin.

Lungs: Clear to auscultation, without wheezing or crackles.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Ext: Hands edematous and cool with + radial pulses.
No erythematous, no drainage.
**FINAL REPORT [**2182-2-25**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2182-2-25**]):    NO GROWTH.
FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
IMAGING:  MRI of thoracic spine [**2182-1-16**]: Significant for T10 and T11 fractures with cord compression at these levels and cord edema.
Again note is made of a marked compression deformity of T11 and compression fracture of T10.
There is a right internal jugular catheter and a right-sided Port-A-Cath through the right internal jugular as well.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Left and right colonic diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Extensive vascular calcifications.
No abnormal fluid collections, intraperitoneal/retroperitoneal free air, or upper abdominal ascites.
Post posterior spinal fusion with advanced degenerative changes as above.
Fluid distended distal esophagus.
[**Month (only) 116**] represent dysmotiliy, reflux, or mechanial process.
CXR [**2-24**]: FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: A right sided port and left internal jugular central venous line are in unchanged position without pneumothorax.
There is mild vascular congestion and a newly apparent right basilar opacity mildly obscuring the right hemidiaphragm.
This could represent a combination of pleural fluid and atelectasis, although consolidation is not excluded.
There is a small left effusion/atelectasis and linear atelectasis in the lingula.
NOTE: CrossMatch information with irregular antibodies: CLINICAL/LAB DATA: Ms. [**Known lastname 7168**] is a 81-year-old female with worsening thoracic spine fracture who is scheduled for laminectomies on [**2182-2-18**].
A blood sample was sent for type and screen.
Antigen phenotype: Fya-antigen negative, K-antigen negative  Transfusion history: No previous transfusions at [**Hospital1 18**].
DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Ms. [**Known lastname 7168**] has a new diagnosis of anti-Fya antibody and a history of anti-K antibody at an outside hospital.
Both anti-Fya and anti-K antibodies are clinically significant and capable of causing hemolytic transfusion reactions.
Free Kappa/Lambda light chains   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 7168**] is an 81 yo woman with PMH significant for multiple myeloma who was admitted from her nursing home for an elective laminectomy for cord compression.
SURGICAL COURSE: Pt was admitted to the hospital electively and was brought to OR where under general anesthesia she underwent posterior thoracic laminectomy and fusion.
On [**2-20**] patient remained hypotensive in bed, despite holding Lasix.
MICU COURSE: In the MICU [**2-23**] she was volume rescuscitated with 6L isotonic fluids after CVL was placed and MAP improved to >65 with minimal time on norepi for BP support.
BPs remained stable, she had no further hypoglycemia, and MS returned to baseline.
#Urosepsis: Patient was continued on Cefepime as treatment for infection.
Of note, her sepsis in the ICU was thought to be due to a pan-sensitive Klebsiella UTI (see sensitivities in results section.)
However, there was a question of HCAP in the ICU as well- with an opacity seen on CXR but no clinical symptoms.
Although the patient did not have a cough and was weaned off oxygen on the floor, Cefepime was continued for possible HCAP as well as UTI.
# Possible adrenal insufficiency: The patient had been on standing steroids for approximately one month prior to admission for cord compression.
# Diabetes Mellitus: The patient was hypoglycemic prior to transfer to MICU with FS in the 30s.
However, on the floor FS were 60s- 80s, in the context of poor PO intake, and so her pm insulin glargine was reduced.
# C.diff diarrhea: Patient developed C.diff positive diarrhea.
# Multiple myeloma: Patient was on thalidomide and dexamethasone prior to admission.
During her stay, she developed worsening anemia and thrombocytopenia, thought to be due to these medications.
Thrombocytopenia improved during his stay and anemia was stable.
AntiPF4 antibody negative.
Of note, free kappa and lambda light chain pending.
# Guiaic positive stools: The patient did have guiaic positive stools during her stay.
However, there was no evidence of acute bleed but this should be followed up by her primary physician.
# S/P laminectomy and fusion of T10-11: Patient's back wound is not completely approximated but appears stable.
# Decubitus Wounds: The patient has skin wounds from her [**Hospital1 1501**] stay.
Her Cr was improved from baseline at discharge, but she does have upper and lower extremity edema, likely from large volume fluid resuscitation during her stay.
# Chronic kidney disease: Stable.
# Parkinsonism: Resting tremor.
2nd MICU Course: Patient was transferred to ICU for hypotension and altered mental status.
Family meeting was held given volume overload and DNR/DNI status and need to escalate care to maintain adequate MAPs, and family, incl [**Telephone/Fax (1) 802**] [**Name (NI) 382**] decided to focus on comfort.
Immed cause of death was hypotension, chief cause was multiple myeloma, other causes were CHF and [**Last Name (un) **].
