He first began to feel unwell this past [**Month (only) 547**], when he was in [**State 108**] and woke up one morning with shortness of breath precipiated by minor exertion (5 steps) which he has never had before.
No CP at the time.
Approximately 4 weeks ago, he developed bilateral, stabbing chest pain.
The pain did not radiate and was not accompanied by SOB or fever.
The pain was worsened by lying flat and on the left side.
Patient unsure if the pain was less severe with leaning forward.
He had an outpatient work up which included ECG, stress test and TTE.
TTE on [**8-30**] demonstrated a pericardial effusion measuring 1.5-1.9cm posteriorly, 1.3-2.1cm anteriorly and 0.8-1.6 cm behind the right atrium.
There was also severely decreased LV systolic function with EF 25-30%.
Patient complained of dyspnea and intermittent sharp, stabbing chest pain w/ coughing or deep breathing, in addition to generalized weakness.
CXR showed post-surgical changes in the left hemithorax, patchy opacity with interstitial markings in the right lung base, suggestive of chronic COPD changes with atelectasis, but no pulmonary vascular congestion.
Bedside echo showed trace pericardial effusion w/o evidence of tamponade.
D-dimer sent and elevated at [**Numeric Identifier 15717**].
Patient underwent CTA which was positive for multifocal PEs, LAD, lytic lesions and soft tissue mass in chest concerning for metastatic disease.
He is unsure if the pain is better with leaning forward.
He has had decreased appetite and endorses a 13 pound weight loss in hte last 2-3 weeks.
He also reports back pain which started 3-4 weeks ago.
The pain is achy/nagging in nature and involves the mid back and lower back.
The pain does not radiate and worsens with weight bearing.
He also developed left leg pain recently from the hip to the knee posteriorly that is worse with weight bearing.
Patient denies weakness in UEs/[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] loss of sensation.
Oncology was involved to guide management, and recommended multiple imaging studies as well as a SPEP/UPEP for mildly elevated calcium, which came back negative.
Bone scan was performed and showed multiple lytic lesions including a large one in the left femur, and also in the thoracic/lumbar spine, pelvis, and ribs.
Patient has also had MRI of the brain which was limited but with no obvious metastases seen.
On arrival to the medical floor the pt c/o central lower back pain, [**6-4**], for which he requested pain medication.
He says that his back pain is currently well-controlled, and that he looks forward to going home after his staging procedure.

Imaging CXR ([**9-9**]): IMPRESSION: Post-surgical changes in the left hemithorax.
Patchy opacity with interstitial markings in the right lung base, which could represent chronic changes with atelectasis.
No pulmonary vascular congestion.
Multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli, the largest noted at the segmental level in the right upper lobe.
No evidence of right heart strain or pulmonary infarct.
These findings are concerning for underlying malignancy.Soft tissue mass identified in the right upper paratracheal region may represent enlarged ymphadenopathy; however, there is concern for a possible lung parenchymal involvement as there appears to be adjacent architectural distortion.
Soft tissue lesion identified in the upper anterior chest wall.
Multiple lytic lesions identified throughout the thoracic spine, right humeral head and sternum highly suspicious for osseous metastases of unknown primary malignancy.
Trace right pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
3 cm rounded hypodensity in the left lateral hepatic lobe, likely hepatic cyst.
TTE ([**9-10**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %) with regional variation (apical segments better than basal segments).
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-27**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion subtending the base of the heart.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Bone scan ([**9-10**]): IMPRESSION: Multiple foci of abnormal tracer uptake, including left femur, thoracic/lumbar spine, pelvis, sternum, and ribs.
Anatomic evaluation of the left femur should be performed to evaluate the risk of pathologic fracture.
Nonocclusive thrombus within the mid-to-distal segments of the left superficial vein.
Non-occlusive thrombus in the left popliteal vein.
Occlusive thrombus within one of the right posterior tibial veins.
MR head ([**9-10**]): FINDINGS: No obvious intracranial mass effect is seen.
Femur and Pelvis XR ([**9-10**]): In the pelvis, there is moderate degenerative change of bilateral femoroacetabular joints and lower lumbar spine.
In the left hip, there are similar findings, with degenerative changes, left femoroacetabular joint.
There are lytic lesions of the left femoral diaphysis.
Correlate with history of metastatic disease.
There is also a subtrochanteric lytic lesion.
High risk for fracture as more than three-quarters of the femoral shaft is involved.
R humerus XR ([**9-10**]): Three views of the right humerus demonstrate medullary based lesion causing endosteal scalloping of the mid humeral diaphysis, with faint periosteal reaction and patchy lucency in the humeral lateral cortex, concerning for aggressive lesion.
There is high fracture risk, although no discrete fracture is identified.
Of note, bone scan demonstrated multiple foci of abnormal tracer uptake and prior CT scan demonstrated multiple lytic lesions on spine CT.
0.10 SPEP:  no specific abnormalities seen UPEP:  no protein detected .
Microbiology: - [**2171-9-13**] Tissue Cx from LYMPH NODE MEDIASTINAL AP WINDOW showed GRAM POSITIVE RODS, rare growth.
-[**9-9**] MRSA screen negative  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 4318**] is a 68yo man with h/o left lower lobectomy for AV malformation, COPD, dilated cardiomyopathy and recent hospitalization for pericardial effusion who p/w weakness and dyspnea and was found to have multifocal PEs, lytic bone lesions and lymphadenopathy on CT.
In summary, he received a biopsy of the left paraaortic lymph nodes, the results of which were not finalized as of [**9-18**] but were thought to be indicative of non-small cell lung cancer.
# Likely metastatic neoplasm of unknown primary:  His chest CT upon admission showed lymphadenopathy and lesions suspicious for malignancy in the chest wall, rubs, and lungs.
Bone scan showed multiple lytic metastases to Lspine and Tspine as well as large lytic lesions in superior and midshaft L femur, concerning for potential for future pathologic fracture.
DDx includes primary lung cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer and multiple myeloma.
This was performed on [**9-13**], and Left para-aortic lymph nodes were sampled.
Based on the patient's wishes to go home as soon as possible, and the patient's relatively poor prognosis from this cancer with complications thereof, we felt that a hospice agency might be able to best meet all of his needs, and he signed on after meeting with a hospice liaison.
# Pulmonary embolisms: Patient had multiple PEs with more clot burden on the right.
Given smoking history as well as lytic lesions/lymphadenopathy on imaging, cause of PE was most likely a hypercoaguable state [**2-27**] malignancy.
On ECG, he did not have any evidence of right heart strain.
LENI showed nonocclusive clots in left superficial and popliteal veins, occlusive clot in right posterior tibial vein.
# Lymphadenopathy/lytic lesions:  Orthopedics was consulted and determined that there was no immediate risk of pathologic fracture, but that he had a high risk of fracture given cortical involvement of lytic lesions and mechanical pain.
There was no e/o tamponade on repeat echo performed at [**Hospital1 18**], and pt remained hemodynamically stable.
