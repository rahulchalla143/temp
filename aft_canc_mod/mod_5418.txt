Chronic cholecystitis, mild.
Tiny focus of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasm, low grade (PanIN I).
No invasive carcinoma.
Multiple foci of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasm, low grade (PanIN I-II), including the uncinate area.
EXTENT OF INVASION Primary Tumor:  pT3:  Tumor extends beyond the pancreas but without involvement of the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery.
One of the lymph nodes involved with tumor is due to contiguous spread.
Minimal pleural effusion.
There have been no interval changes.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, greater in the left side with associated atelectasis and atelectasis in the right upper lobe are unchanged as does cardiomegaly and prominent pulmonary arteries.
There is no CHF or new lung abnormalities.
The RV is not well seen but may be dilated with depressed systolic function.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now seen.
There is a hypodense area adjacent to the pancreaticojejunostomy that cannot be evaluated well without oral contrast.
The hypodense area appears to be a jejunal loop; however, hematoma or postoperative collection cannot be excluded.
Multiple hypodense liver lesions in both lobes of the liver, one in segment II appears to be new.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with increased dependent atelectasis versus infiltrate in the right lower lobe.
Minimal atelectasis in the left base.
Status post abdominal hernia repair.
Large bladder calculus.
Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2188-7-27**] 4:27 AM Provisional Findings Impression: DJRX SUN [**2188-7-27**] 11:49 AM Bilateral perihilar densities suspicious for pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: Focal areas of increased density bilaterally suspicious for pneumonia.
A little interval change .
No acute intracranial pathology identified.
Sinus disease as described above, likely related to chronic inflammatory process and/or patient's intubated status; however, correlation should be made for any findings to suggest acute sinusitis/mastoiditis.
Allowing for difference in positions, there is no significant change in the degree of cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural effusions, or pulmonary vascular congestion.
No pulmonary embolus or acute aortic abnormality.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with fluid tracking into the fissures, which could be loculated.
Associated compressive atelectasis demonstrates enhancement, and is not likely to represent pneumonic consolidation.
Extensive vascular calcification.
Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2188-8-6**] 4:36 AM IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**7-31**]: Mild pulmonary edema has worsened since [**8-5**].
Large heart and generally large and tortuous thoracic aorta are chronic.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2188-8-14**] 4:47 AM Of note, the patient is markedly rotated.
Bibasilar consolidations consistent with aspiration or pneumonia are stable.
Opacity in the right upper lobe is more conspicuous in this examination could be due to aspiration.
Radiology Report VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW Study Date of [**2188-8-19**] 9:47 AM IMPRESSION: Mild oropharyngeal dysphagia characterized by mildly reduced bolus control with thin liquids, and mildly reduced laryngeal elevation and laryngeal valve closure, resulting in episodes of penetration during swallow of thin liquids.
Three hypodense liver lesions no fully characterized.
Peribronchovascular ground glass opacities may represent infection, inflammation and less likely edema.
Enlarged pulmonary artery suggesting underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 73 year old female with a pancreatic head mass who went to the OR on [**2188-7-16**] for: 1.
There is no evidence of any pneumothorax, and she had a bronchoscopy in the case which was nonrevealing.
On POD 2, she desaturated on floor and was transferred to the ICU and reintubated for acute respiratory distress/failure.
The following summarizes significant events:  [**7-18**]: CTA neg for PE , increased PEEP, EKG, cardiac enzymes were negative.

Peribronchovascular ground glass opacities may represent infection, inflammation and less likely edema.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Due to Bradycardia and pauses, her nodal blocking agents were held.
Zosyn to continue for 2 weeks due to PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA from the JP drain.
