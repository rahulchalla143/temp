FINDINGS: Similar to the prior exam, a left chest wall pacemaker/AICD with dual contiguous leads remains stable in position and course.
The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.
Aortic tortuosity with calcification of the arch is again noted.
No effusion or pneumothorax is noted.
A gradual S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine including prior vertebroplasty in the upper lumbar spine is again noted and likewise stable.
IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 87 yo F with h/o DM type 2, CML, HTN, HL, CAD s/p MI in [**2094**] (treated medically), ventricular tachycardia s/p AICD, and PAF who presents with hyperglycemia.
The Ddx for her spike in blood sugars was natural progression, change in diet, nonadherence to medication, infection (UTI), or cardiac ischemia.
EKG showed no ischemic changes or peaked T waves, and CXR showed no acute pulmonary process.
Some evidence exists implying increased insulin sensitivity with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] it is possible that her discontinuation of [**First Name3 (LF) **] several weeks ago worsened her glucose control.
Her discharge medications for diabetes were as follows: Lantus 20U qhs, glipizide 5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
##UTI On admission, the patient complained of dysuria, and her UA showed many bacteria and [**4-22**] WBC's.
She remained afebrile throughout her hospital admission.
#Coronary artery disease s/p MI [**2094**] (RCA occlusion, managed medically): The patient's admission EKG showed mild STE's in the inferior leads, which resolved on subsequent EKGs throughout the admission.
Statin was not initiated because of the patient's reported prior allergy to atorvastatin and her history of elevated LFT's.
The patient's remained on room air through her admission, and her shortness of breath was at baseline.
#Ventricular tachyarrhythmia s/p AICD in [**2107**] The patient remained on her home dofetilide 500 mcg q12h and digoxin 0.125 mg po daily.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Hyperglycemia from uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type II UTI   Discharge Condition: Stable, ambulatory, tolerating oral diet   Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 1617**],  You were admitted for acutely increased blood sugar levels (>500) from your diabetes.
You were treated with IV insulin, and we performed multiple finger sticks each day to monitor your blood glucose.
