PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE:  Base of tongue resection with primary closure.
Thus, the patient now presents for salvage surgery.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
He has a significant past history of tobacco.
He was in no acute distress.
The oropharyngeal examination revealed approximately a 2-cm firm mass at the right base of the tongue.
Otherwise, no other lesions on his tongue.
No oropharyngeal or oropharyngeal mucosal lesions were appreciated.
Examination of the patient's neck did not reveal evidence of lymphadenopathy.
The patient had a normal first heart sound and second heart sound with a regular rate and rhythm.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops were appreciated.
There was evidence of a previous open G-tube.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  In summary, the patient is a 69-year-old with residual squamous cell carcinoma of the base of the tongue, status post chemoradiation therapy.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   Thus, the patient presents to the hospital for a same day admission for surgery.
At this time he underwent a right selective neck dissection including levels I through IV with a lateral pharyngotomy approach to the base of the tongue.
The patient's immediate postoperative course was benign except for new onset intermittent persistent headaches.
In summary, they found the headaches to likely be of little concern and suggested muscle contraction and spasm as the likely source.
Otherwise, the patient's postoperative course was without acute complications.
The patient was evaluated by Speech and Swallow with a video swallow assessment approximately on postoperative day seven.
At this time the patient was found to have some evidence of aspiration.
DISCHARGE ACTIVITY:  The patient had no activity restrictions.
DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:   He was to follow up with Speech and Swallow for continuing swallowing rehabilitation with hopes of eventually being able to tolerate a full diet by mouth and concomitant discontinuation of the G-tube.
