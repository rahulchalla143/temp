Admission Date:  [**2200-8-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2200-8-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2122-5-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Statins-Hmg-Coa Reductase Inhibitors  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 594**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 86045**] is a 78 year-old man with metastatic prostate CA and pulmonary hypertension who presents with 5 days of worsening SOB, DOE, and fatigue.
The symptoms first began about a month ago, slightly before he was admitted s/p fall and found to have a new O2 requirement.
No etiology was identified during that admission, but subsequent pulmonary work-up identified new pulmonary HTN.
The patient reports that after that prior admission, he first wore O2 only at night but progressively wore it more and more during the day due to increasing SOB, DOE, and fatigue.
Over the last 5 day, he reports acutely worse SOB even at rest.
Exam was notable for clear lungs and mild b/l LE edema.
A CT chest PE protocol showed no PE and diffuse osseous metastatic disease.

No acute cardiopulmonary process.
No pulmonary embolus.
Enlarging right lower lobe 8-mm nodule, suspicious for metastatic disease.
Diffuse osseous metastatic disease.
Unremarkable appearance of the liver with no biliary dilatation.
Mild splenomegaly.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No evidence of lymphangitic tumor spread in the chest.
Stable size of numerous tiny nodules, and a 7-mm nodule in the right lower lobe.
Enlargement of the right and left main pulmonary arteries, consistent with clinical history of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Diffuse heterogeneous enhancement of the liver, with multiple hypodense lesions most concerning for metastasis; diffuse infection is unlikely to have this appearance.
Diffuse osseous metastatic involvement, unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 78 year-old man with metastatic prostate CA and recently diagnosed pulmonary hypertension who presents one month of gradually worsening SOB, DOE, and fatigue, acutely worse over the 5 days prior to admission.
# SOB/Pulmonary hypertension: Likely multifactorial although no clear diagnosis made.
We suspected pulmonary hypertension secondary to possibly pulmonary vaso occlusive disease.
Patient had had numerous work ups for PE and all had been negative in the past.
[**Month/Year (2) **] showed stable LV dysfunction with LVEF 55% c/w CAD and worsened pulmonary HTN (TR gradient = 60mmHg, up from 36mmHg on [**2200-7-2**]).
Patient did not appear volume overloaded on exam, and orthostatics suggest he is actually volume down.
CTA negative for PE or an infectious process.
High resolution CT negative for lymphangitic tumor spread.
Workup for primary pulmonary hypertension was negative for [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, RF, HIV.
His physiology appeared to be consistent with pulmonary [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusive disease as his PA pressures were elevated without evidence of pulmonary arterial pathology (negative CTA) nor left-sided heart pathology (reassuring [**Last Name (un) **] with regard to LVEF and left-sided valvular function.)
[**Name (NI) 30983**], his clinical deterioration appeared to be due to progression of his underlying metastatic cancer, although this could not be definitively proven without biopsy.
# SIRS: Patient spiking fevers to 101.6 with SBP in the 80s as well as tachypnea, tachycardia, and lactate 2.9.
Lungs are clear, and he has no cough.
Hypotension initially responded to IV fluids.
# Transaminitis: Has elevated LFTs at baseline but admission ALT 343, AST 198, AP 1058, tbili 1.7 are 3-4 times above his baseline.
Most likely congestive hepatopathy in the setting of worsening pulmonary hypertension versus metastatic spread.
RUQ ultrasound was unremarkable for any intrinsic liver process.
Less likely viral syndrome.
# Thrombocytopenia: Baseline plt ~100, but has been stably 25-30.
# Metastatic prostate cancer: extensive bony mets seen on chest CT, no pathological fractures.
# DMII: Continued home 30 units 70/30 at breakfast and dinner and HISS  # HYPOTHYROIDISM - Continued levothyroxine  # Transitional: as above, patient passed peacefully with family at beside.
