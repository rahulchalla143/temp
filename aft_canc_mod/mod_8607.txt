At approximately 4 AM on the morning of presentation the patient woke up and began to cough which is typical for him secondary to copious secretions.
The bleeding lasted for approximately 1 hour and had stopped by the time he reached the emergency room.
The bleeding was not associated with lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria, melena, hematochezia, leg pain or swelling.
He reports a similar episode of hemoptysis in [**2189-12-22**] which was ultimately attributed to granuloma tissue near his tracheostomy site which was excised.
ENT was consulted who performed performed a fiberoptic laryngoscopy through the tracheostomy and saw no active sites of bleeding and no granualation tissue.
He had a CT of the neck which showed no evidence of tracheal malpositioning or erosion into the major vascular structures and evidence of right upper lobe aspiration.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he had no complaints.
Denied lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, melena, hematochezia, leg pain or swelling.
Shortly after arrival the patient was noted to begin bleeding profusely from his nose and tracheostomy site.

A heterogeneously-enhancing region of soft tissue is noted in the region of the vallecula likely representing known vallecular carcinoma.
There is moderate lobulated mucosal thickening within the maxillary sinuses.
Calcified atherosclerotic plaque is present at bilateral carotid bifurcations with greater than 50% narrowing bilaterally.
There is a right dominant vertebral artery system.
A small amount of patchy opacity is present within the right lung apex most consistent with aspiration.
Injected contrast material via the G-tube is seen filling the stomach and entering into the proximal small bowel.
There is no extraluminal leak of contrast, stricture, or definite obstruction to flow.
The bowel gas pattern is nonobstructive and there is no free gas or pneumatosis.
Worsening of the left lower lobe opacification.
Cirrhotic-appearing liver with no focal lesions.
Sludge in the gallbladder with no gallstones identified.
Trace of ascites and a left pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: PROCEDURES DURING ADMISSION IR embolization of L facial artery [**12-3**]  CONSULTATIONS DURING ADMISSION SICU Gastroenterology Interventional Radiology Pain and Palliative Care Chronic Pain Service Head and Neck Oncology  Mr. [**Known lastname 10378**] is a 52 year old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the vallecula s/p chemotherapy and XRT with unresectable cervical recurrence, alcoholic cirrhosis with esophageal varices, and recent admission for abdominal pain and epistaxis s/p bilateral [**Female First Name (un) 899**] embolizations on [**11-15**] who presented on [**2190-12-3**] from home with hemoptysis.
Hemoptysis/epistaxis: Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the pt experienced massive epistaxis from the nose, mouth and tracheostomy site.
It was concluded that his unresectable pharyngeal CA was likley eroding the carotid artery, the most likely source of the massive bleeding.
He subsequently underwent IR embolization of the L facial artery on [**12-3**] although active bleeding was not appreciated.
Unfortunately we were not able to pinpoint the specific source of these episodic bleeds with IR.
GI was consulted to consider esophageal varices as a source of bleeding.
A liver U/S was taken which showed signs of liver cirrhosis with mild ascites and splenomegaly.
Ultimately we were left to conlude we had run out of realistic surgical or intervential options in controlling future episodes.
The family and the patient agreed at that point to withhold future treatments, blood/platelet transfusions, and provide minimal supportive care and comfort measures only during the next bleed.
On [**1-5**] the patient had a chronic pain consult to help with palliative care in managing his symptoms.
In late [**Month (only) 404**] the patient began to develop more frequent episodes of ventricular tachycardia and torsades that were self-limited but accompanied by extreme anxiety for the patient requiring increasing anxiolytics.
Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Squamous cell cancer vallecula/tonsillar, X 2, s/p trach, peg, XRT, chemo, possible recurrence noticed on recent PET, but  decision to wait until [**8-30**] for further eval given good functional status at present.
Liver cirrhosis secondary to EtOH, complicated by splenomegaly, esophageal varices (last EGD [**11/2188**] with grade 1  varices) with prior bleeding.
Reported history of portal vein thrombosis, though I can not find when this happened.
Chronic pancreatitis secondary to EtOH.
