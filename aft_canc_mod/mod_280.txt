In addition, there is a radiopaque line projecting partially over the course expected for PICC line, but than a less radiopaque catheter is seen coiled in the left neck.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is some plate-like atelectasis in the left lower lung.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 8004**] is a 75 yoM with neurogenic bladder s/p paraplegia from lymphoma involving his spinal cord in [**2157**].
Patient was started on zosyn empirically given prior UTI's with zosyn-sensitive Proteus species.
GRAM NEGATIVE ROD BACTEREMIA, SEPSIS: Patient presents from OSH with hypotension and blood and urine cultures positive for Serratia marcesens after manipulation of foley catheter.
ABDOMINAL DISTENSION: Patient with chronic abdominal bloating of unclear [**Name2 (NI) 8006**].
He admits to some improvement in constipation with the antibiotic course but no improvement in bloating.
He was started on scheduled miralax for constipation and high dose simethicone.
ANEMIA: He has a baseline anemia with an acute on chronic Hct drop noted in the MICU.
This was likely due to blood loss from traumatic foley change and had an appropriate response to 1 unit pRBC.
Based on Dr. [**Name (NI) 8007**] note on [**7-/2161**] it was felt that his tremor was more consistent with a familial essential tremor rather that parkinsonian tremor.
