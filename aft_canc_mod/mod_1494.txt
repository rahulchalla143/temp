Admission Date:  [**2169-5-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-6-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2091-11-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: tumor resection  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**5-31**]: Right parietal craniotomy and resection of lesion [**6-1**]: Right craniotomy evacuation of epidural hematoma   History of Present Illness: 77 year old woman followed as an outpatient with complaint of right upper extremity pain and burning.
Upon examination she was noted to have symptoms likely from a cervical pathology.
Past Medical History: Type II DM Hyperlipidemia HTN Right parietal convexity meningioma  Social History: Patient lives with her daughter, [**Name (NI) 24095**] in [**Name (NI) 392**].
Family History: Brother - DM  Physical Exam: At discharge:  She is awake, and alert.
Left hyperreflexia with upgoing left toe.
Extra-axial, dural-based mass lesion measuring 15 (CC) x 25 (transverse) x 31 (AP) dimensions within the right parietal region of the vertex with homogenous enhancement shows no significant change from the prior examination allowing for positioning and technique.
Stable size of the small dural-based lesion in the right temporal region lateral to Meckel's cave.
Paranasal Sinus disease  [**5-31**] CT Head: Expected post-operative changes, after recent right frontovertex  craniotomy with resection of the known frontal meningioma.
There is moderate bilateral prefrontal pneumocephalus and minimal blood products in the surgical bed.
[**6-1**] MRI Brain: New convex epidural fluid collection with contrast extravasation, highly concerning for epidural hematoma and active bleeding.
Status post evacuation of a right frontoparietal epidural hematoma, with evolving right frontoparietal white matter hypodensities likely representing edema.
No new intracranial hemorrhage.
Moderate amount of pneumocephalus and expected post-surgical changes  [**6-1**] CT head - 1.
Status post evacuation of a right frontoparietal epidural hematoma, with evolving right frontoparietal white matter hypodensities likely representing edema.
No new intracranial hemorrhage.
Moderate amount of pneumocephalus and expected post-surgical changes  EEG [**6-1**] This telemetry captured one pushbutton activation.
It showed some rhythmic left arm jerking of low amplitude 5 video, but there was no clear electrographic seizure at the time.
There was some rhythmic delta activity in the right frontal area then and, at other times, some brief but rhythmic sharp activity in the right central region.
These findings suggest areas of potential epileptogenisis likely related to the clinical observations.
Otherwise, the most prominent finding was the lower voltage and slow activity in the left occipital area.
The event at 7:30 on the morning of [**5-31**] showed video and EEG  evidence of a seizure.
The focus was not completely clear by EEG as there was irregular slowing in the right central region and also left temporal area, both with sharp and spike features.
At other times, the spikes and sharp waves were evident but did not appear to lead to clinical or electrographic seizures.
The background remained slow and encephalopathic throughout.
[**6-3**]: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
The telemetry showed a mildly slow background throughout.
After the first hour or so, right central sharp waves and focal slowing were less prominent.
Also, the mildly slow, often 7 Hz, background while generally improved from the previous day, did not change much after that first hour.
There were no electrographic seizures.
[**6-4**]: IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
In addition, there was minimal slowing and occasional sharp wave in the right central region, but there were no repetitive discharges or electrographic seizures.
[**6-5**]: MPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of attenuation of faster frequencies and background rhythmicity over the right hemisphere particularly in the right parasagittal area.
These findings are indicative of a mild to moderate diffuse right hemispheric dysfunction more prominently seen in the parasagittal region.
The background activity over the left hemisphere reaches 8-8.5 Hz with admixed excess theta.
In addition, there are brief runs of bifrontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).
These findings are indicative of a mild to moderate diffuse encephalopathy of nonspecific etiology.
No epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures are present.
No significant change in the appearance of the post-surgical resection bed in comparison to exam obtained 15 hours prior.
Again seen is a small amount of pneumocephalus, trace residual blood products, and [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter hypodensities, most consistent with edema.
[**6-4**] Ct Head -  With the exception of the resolution of the minimal pneumocephalus previously seen, there has been no significant change in the appearance of the right [**Last Name (un) 24096**]-frontal post-surgical resection bed, including trace residual blood products and [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter hypodensities, most consistent with edema.
[**6-5**] EEG: Findings are indicative of a mild to moderate diffuse encephalopathy of nonspecific etiology.
No epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures are present.
Compared to the prior day's recording, there is improvement.
Surgery was without complication and she tolerated it well.
She was extubated and transferred to the ICU for neurological monitoring.
She was stable overnight but in the morning she was noted to be more agitated/confused and had significant left sided weakness.
This was thought to be due to post operative edema.
Post operative MRI was performed which revealed new convex epidural fluid collection with contrast extravasation.
Head CT was obtained which showed acute hemorrhage in the R frontoparietal region.
Post operatively, patient was lethargic and confused, no movement of LLE.
Post op head CT showed good resection of clot with no acute hemorrhage.
EEG showed seizure activity in the R central region and her keppra was increased to 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] and dilatin was added.
[**6-3**], Patient's TFs were held and she was extubated without incident.
On [**6-6**], she was without seizure activity.
At the time of discharge on [**6-9**] she was tolerating a pureed (dysphagia) diet with thin liquids, afebrile with stable vital signs.
70/30 30 Units Breakfast 70/30 2 Units Dinner   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: right parietal lesion right epidural hematoma seizures postop anemia dysphagia malnutrition   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam) and Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicines, please take as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week to measure the phenytoin level.
This can be drawn at rehab or your PCP?????
