Admission Date:  [**2159-1-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2159-1-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2073-4-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Percocet / Cefaclor / Monopril / Ciprofloxacin / Iodine / Antihistamine / Ambien  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**] Chief Complaint: presented for upgrade to biventricular pacer, transferred to CCU for management of cardiogenic shock  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Catherization for upgrade of biventricular pacer  History of Present Illness: 85 yo M with hx of AF & CHB s/p PPM ([**4-/2148**]), generator change ([**2-7**]), CAD s/p CABG ([**2139**]) & multiple coronary/renal/peripheral stents, ischemic CM (EF 35%) who presented for resynchronization with upgrade to biventricular pacer given recently worsened EF and CHF symptoms.
During the procedure he underwent balloon venoplasty of his obstructed SVC, and became increasingly agitated requiring more sedation.
He was intubated, became hypotensive with BPs droppng to systolic 60s, and started on multiple pressors.
Emergent echo showed no tamponade, but decreased cardiac function likely cardiogenic shock.
Given he had instrumentation of both the SVC and pulmonary artery, with hemoptysis during intubation, there was concern for hypovolemia secondary to blood loss (?
into mediastinum versus pulmonary hemorrhage).
CXR was negative for PTX.
He was hypothermic and had a lactate of 10.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is no pericardial effusion.
EEG [**2159-1-10**] IMPRESSION: This long-term EEG showed an encephalopathic background throughout.
The background was slow and of low voltage.
There were no prominent focal abnormalities.
There were no epileptiform features.
EEG [**2159-1-11**] IMPRESSION: This long-term EEG showed an encephalopathic background throughout.
The background was slow and of low voltage.
There were no prominent focal abnormalities.
There were no epileptiform features.
EEG [**2159-1-12**] This EEG telemetry with video showed a low voltage mildly slow background throughout, without any evidence of seizures or epileptiform discharges.
There were no focal abnormalities or epileptiform features.
EEG [**2159-1-21**] IMPRESSION: This telemetry showed a markedly encephalopathic background throughout.
There were no clearly epileptiform features or electrographic seizures.
There was frequent movement artifact, and some of this appeared to be large amplitude movements, possibly as part of an abnormal respiratory pattern.
Also, there were some sudden jerks of the head to the left, possibly myoclonic, but without associated epileptiform features on the EEG, and at a frequency of under one every three seconds.
There were no clear seizures.
EEG [**2159-1-22**] This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
The background was slow throughout, with additional bursts of generalized slowing.
These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing.
There were no clearly epileptiform features, and there were no electrographic seizures.
No acute intracranial process on CT. 2.
Extensive subcortical white matter hypodensities; could be related to chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
No acute intracranial process.
Increased mucosal thickening within the sphenoid sinus could represent an ongoing inflammatory process.
Cholelithiasis, without specific son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of acute cholecystitis.
No biliary ductal dilation.
Extensive aortic atherosclerotic disease, with linear echogenic focus within the mid abdominal aorta possibly representing a dissection flap of indeterminate chronicity.
Bilateral renal cysts.
Right pleural effusion.
ABDOMINAL XRAY [**2159-1-16**] Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with no evidence of obstruction .
CXR [**2159-1-16**] Persistent bilateral pneumonia, or resuscitation-related lung contusion.
LOWER EXTREMITY NON INVASIVE ULTRAOUND IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in both lower extremities.
Right pectoral pacemaker, no evidence of pneumothorax.
Pulmonary vascular engorgement has also improved, indicating improved cardiac function.
Right lung base is partially obscured by pleural effusion, but also appears to have cleared of pneumonia or asymmetric edema.
Small right pleural effusion persists.
There is no pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE This is an 85 year old gentleman with a history of atrial fibrillation, complete heart block PPM, coronary artery disease CABG & multiple coronary/renal/peripheral stents, ischemic cardiomyopathy who presented for upgrade to biventricular pacer.
His procedure was complicated by cardiogenic shock.
Post operative course was further complicated by pulmonary hemorrhage prolonged intubation and second arrest while having a doboff placed.
Concern for brain stem injury in the setting of absent spontaneous eye movements, and inablity to follow commands.
ACTIVE ISSUES # GOALS OF CARE: The patient was full code on admission to the cardiac intensive care unit.
# CARDIOGENIC SHOCK: Unclear precipitant for intra-operative PEA arrest, but likely related to baseline low EF and poor reserve and likely intra-operative complication of pulmonary hemorrhage secondary to pulmonary artery - left main stem fistula.
Cardiac biomarkers were not consistent with acute MI.
An emergent echocardiogram was negative for tamponade and revealed severely depressed cardiac function.
TTE revealed EF 30%, right ventricular cavity dilation and depressed free wall contractility, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate PA systolic HTN.
# PULMONARY HEMORHAGE: Initially, there was concern for hypovolemic shock secondary to blood loss given instrumentation of SVC and distal pulmonary arteries.
Additionally, he was noted to have hemoptysis during intubation.
A repeat Hct revealed a 5 point drop.
He continued to have gross blood suctioned from his ET tube.
Pulmonary was consulted for bronchoscopy, which revealed a large amount of blood and active bleeding in the left mainstem, endotracheal tube was selectively placed into the right mainstem.
Overnight, off heparin the patient did well, and only old blood was suctioned from ET tube therafter.
After second arrest, the patient developed persistent fevers without localizing source of infection.
Etiology initially felt to be likely pulmonary hemorrhage.
After several days of persistent fevers, and interval development of hypotension requiring intermittant pressor support, the patient was empirically started on vancomucin and zosyn.
# NEUROLOGIC IMPAIRMENT: After inital arrest, the patient was followed by neurology.
EEG findings were significant for a slow background without any evidence of seizures or epileptiform discharges.
A non contrast head CT was consistent with extensive subcortical white matter disease, unclear how much secondary to prior ischemia versus current event.
After second arrest and re-intubation a repeat EEG demonstrated again slow low voltage background, with additional bursts of additional slowing indicative of widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.
Off sedation for several days, his exam was notable for intact brainstem reflexes and purposeful movements of his extremities.
However the patient was no longer responsive to commands and appeared to have no spontaneous eye movements with eyes in slight upgaze.
# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE / PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE: History of multiple stents in coronary, renal, peripheral arteries.
Cardiac biomarkers show mildly elevated trop, but flat CK and CKMB making an ischemic event unlikely.
He was continued on aspirin and plavix which were discontinued in the setting of pulmonary hemorrhage.
# SYSTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILYRE: Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Last echo with EF of 35%, echo performed during cath showed severely depressed global function.
Most likely etiology for hypotension is cardiogenic shock.
A repeat echo demonstrated an EF of 30%, right ventricular cavity dilation and depressed free wall contractility, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate PA systolic HTN.
# RHYTHM: Underlying rhythm is Atrial Fibrillation and Complete Heart Block with evidence of ventricular pacing.
The QRS complexes on EKG are not consistent with BiVentricular pacing.
It is likely that the leads became displaced during his acute decompensation (described in HPI).
We continued his Aspirin which was discontinued in setting of pulmonary hemorrhage.
# CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: Creatinine on presentation was 2.4 with unclear baseline.
# METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: The patient initially presented with an anion gap acidosis in the setting of elevated lactate (10 on admission) from cardiogenic shock.
He later developed a hyperchloremic non anion gap metabolic acidosis with acidemia from mixed respiratory acidosis in the setting of multiple normal saline based gtts (midazolam and precedex) and normal saline boluses during second arrest.
# HYPERTENSION: Outpatient antihypertensive medications held in setting of cardiogenic shock.
# HYPERLIPIDEMIA: Held in setting of cardiogenic shock.
# ELEVATED BLOOD GLUCOSE: The Elevated blood glucose levels: The patient was started on an insulin sliding scale.
No history of diabetes.
