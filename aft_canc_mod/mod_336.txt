Admission Date:  [**2120-9-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-10-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2051-3-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Protonix  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 473**] Chief Complaint: Mass in pancreatic head  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2120-9-19**] 1.
Unfortunately she has recurred in that she has a large mass in the head of her pancreas which is a metastasis from the renal cell cancer.
It has eroded through the duodenal wall and has been causing recalcitrant gastrointestinal bleeding necessitating continual transfusions of packed red blood cells.
Past Medical History: Metastatic renal cell cancer (mets to parotids, lung, pancreas)- dx'ed in [**2111**], s/p R nephrectomy- [**2111**] h/o +PPD HTN TIA osteoporosis  Social History: works as receptionist at [**Hospital **] Medical Society no tobacco, quit 40 years ago no alcohol   Family History: lung cancer- father  Physical Exam: On physical exam Gen: well-nourished, relatively thin, no acute distress [**Name (NI) 4459**]: No jaundice, absent parotid gland on the left, but otherwise, her head and neck exam is unremarkable.
She has no jugular venous distention.
Pulm: Her respiratory rate is unlabored, and her breath sounds symmetrical.
ABD: Her abdomen is soft, nondistended, and nontender with no masses at all.
b) Small bowel segment, with chronic inactive inflammation.
Metastatic renal cell carcinoma, 6.7 cm, involving the duodenum and pancreas (see note #2).
Five regional lymph nodes, no malignancy identified (0/5).
Small foci of inactive chronic pancreatitis.
Rare focus of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN, grade I).
Chronic focally active duodenitis (see note #1).
The duodenal and jejunal mucosa show chronic inflammation with marked villous shortening, probably related to stasis and bacterial proliferation.
Other causes including celiac disease should also be considered.
The tumor morphology is consistent with that of a conventional (clear cell) renal cell carcinoma.
Approximately 60% of the tumor cells have granular eosinophilic cytoplasm.
Approximately 15% of the tumor showed spindle cells (sarcomatoid) growth.
The patient was pain controlled with a PCA after the epidural was d/c'd.
The patient began to feel some abdominal discomfort later that night.
She continued to feel abdominal discomfort the following day and she required fluid boluses for blood pressure control on the night of POD#[**7-16**].
She then began to develop abdominal pain, with a CT scan on the morning of [**9-26**] that demonstrated that she was leaking on the basis of a presumed enteric dehiscence from either the pancreatic, biliary or duodenojejunostomy anastomoses.
While she required quite a bit of fluid before she went into the operating room, she was reasonably stable hemodynamically but had a low urine output and the operation was performed on an emergency basis.
Antibiotics were started (Vanco, Levo, Flagyl) for positive cultures from the OR (strep viridans, enterococcus, & gram-negative rods).
This was likely due to pulmonary edema from overall total body fluid overload.
After extubation she remained stable but had one episode of respiratory distress manifested by an acute desaturation which was possibly an episode of flash pulmonary edema.
She also had a very brief episode of Afib and was started on an amiodarone drip on [**10-9**].
She was seen by ophthomology and neurology for a visual field deficit and was noted to have a condition compared to [**Doctor Last Name 4116**] syndrome.
A head CT revealed bilateral effacement of the occipital sulci.
MRI showed bilateral occipital signal abnormalities consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.
An MRA as well as bilateral carotid ultrasound showed no pathology.
