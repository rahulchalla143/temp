He presented with fever, cough, and fatigue in the setting of undergoing bowel prep for colonoscopy (for workup of chronic diarrhea).
Of note he had a recent MRSA PNA and Pseudomonas sinus infection (as well a thrush and intertiginous [**Female First Name (un) 564**]) and had been on vanc and cefepime.
CXR in the ED was concerning for an opacity.
Azithromycin was started on [**1-16**] due to concern for atypical PNA.
IVIG was recommended, but not given due to concern for administration during fevers.
Nightfloat was called to see him due to worsening tachypnea in the 40's and initiated transfer to the MICU.
ROS was limited due to respiratory distress.

RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2107-1-21**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
MODERATE GROWTH.
The rhythm is likely atrial flutter/coarse atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
The left lower lobe opacity is slightly more extensive than on the previous examination and is today accompanied by a small left pleural effusion.
No evidence of newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.
Unchanged heart size, unchanged mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
[**1-20**] LENIs: No deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity.
Cytology: [**1-18**] Bronchial washings: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Brief Hospital Course: Initial differential for his tachypnea and hypoxia included worsening PNA, PE, or acute CHF.
Patient was intubated emergently on arrival to MICU for respiratory distress.
Microbiology studies were as above; sputum grew pseudomonas and aspergillus.
IP was consulted for possible u/s guided thoracentesis of left pleural effusion but were unable to locate a big enough pocket of fluid.
Blood pressures were initially stable but the patient eventually developed likely septic shock, and became vasopressor dependent.
His CLL was evident with leukocytosis beyond his baseline WBC levels.
IVIG was considered, but ultimately not given in his state of acute critical illness and fevers.
The patient's family had been kept aware of his worsening condition.
