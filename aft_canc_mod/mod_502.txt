Admission Date:  [**2170-1-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2170-1-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2095-6-11**]       Sex:  M  Service:  MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73 year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, history of deep venous thrombosis and PEs who presents with complaints of worsening shortness of breath.
The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] from [**12-18**] to the 4th for an asthma exacerbation.
The patient showed some mild to moderate improvement in his shortness of breath.
He was noted at that time to have a known vocal cord polyp, which was believed to be stable on laryngoscopy down in the Emergency Department.
Pulmonary function tests at that time revealed mild restrictive lung disease and flow volume loop revealed extra thoracic obstruction.
The patient was diagnosed with vocal cord polyps in [**2169-6-16**] by ENT and it was felt by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 217**] that this was the etiology of the patient's worsening shortness of breath.
Although the patient's symptoms seem to improve with inhalers and steroids after discharge he noted a one week worsening shortness of breath upon exertion, worsening hoarseness and orthopnea.
on account that there was a question of whether the patient's congestive heart failure was exacerbating.
The patient denies any fever, productive cough, change in peripheral edema, pleurisy or chest pain.
The patient denies any dysphagia with food or liquids, no weight change or night sweats.
No prior history of chewing tobacco.
No hemoptysis.
Given the patient's previous history of pulmonary emboli a CTA was performed, which showed no PEs.
The patient was evaluated at that time with laryngoscopy and it was noted that there was significant edema and erythema of the false cords and folds bilaterally.
The bilateral arytenoid was mobile during phonation and inspiration, but without much mobility at the glottic level.
Given the question of a supraglottitis versus laryngeal mass CT of the neck was performed simultaneously with the CT angiogram and showed fullness and thickening of the vocal cords bilaterally with narrowing of the airway.
There was no discreet mass or abnormal lymphadenopathy noted at that time.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2163**].
Congestive heart failure last echocardiogram from [**2166**] shows biventricular enlargement, systolic dysfunction with an EF of 25%, moderate mitral regurgitation and pulmonary artery hypertension.
History of atrial fibrillation status post duel chamber pacemaker and AICD in [**2166**] 4.
History of lower extremity deep venous thrombosis status post IVC filter secondary to PEs bilaterally in [**2168-6-16**].
History of retroperitoneal bleed.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
[**Name (NI) **] history of chewing tobacco.
No visible abnormalities.
Extremities left greater then right, 1+ lower extremity edema, tender to palpation in the bilateral calf.
No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Neurological alert and oriented times three, moving all extremities, no focal abnormalities.
Chest x-ray showed no pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
Neck and CTA showed no PE and fullness and thickening of the bilateral vocal cords with narrowing of airway as described above, no discreet mass or lymphadenopathy.
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with frequent premature ventricular contractions.
Significant bigeminy with normal axis, QRS prolongation, old significance of S wave or R wave in lead V1, old T wave inversion in lead 1.
The patient was started on CPAP at night in order to prevent soft tissue collapse and was placed on cool nebs throughout the day.
Repeat fiberoptic examination on [**1-7**] revealed mild epiglottic edema, bilateral false vocal cord edema, limited PVC motion and limited visualization of the left posterior vocal cord.
The follow up plan was for endoscopy in the Operating Room for performance of biopsy of the left laryngeal lesion.
The patient was also evaluated by cardiology and with echocardiogram to rule out any valvular abnormalities or significant atrial thrombus secondary to atrial fibrillation.
Repeat echocardiogram showed an EF less then 20% with severe left ventricular dilatation.
Of note the patient also had significant atrial fibrillation with tachybrady events.
At times he dropped his rate down into the 40s, but with over symptomatic or dropped his blood pressure.
When evaluated by EP to assess his pacemaker EP noted that the patient's pulse was only palpable every other beat secondary ventricular bigeminy and that his pacer was functioning perfectly well.
Biopsy of the left vocal cord lesion and right vocal cord lesion were done by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
Following the procedure the patient was given 12 mg of intraoperative Decadron and an endotracheal tube was placed secondary to narrow airway.
Pathology quickly returned, which showed a squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.
The left true vocal cord and commissure lesion showed an invasive and in situ squamous cell carcinoma moderately differentiated.
On the right vocal cord lesion there was an invasive squamous cell carcinoma also moderately differentiated.
In addition to biopsy there was small amount of debulking, which was done at the time of the procedure.
Following the procedure the Ceftriaxone which discontinued as it was used as a prophylactic medication for any possible laryngeal infection.
Following the biopsy it was known that the edema was more consistent with tumor and therefore the Ceftriaxone was discontinued.
Trachea was found to be clear with slight secretions.
The larynx showed some edema, but decreased erythema.
In regard to the patient's vocal cord lesion and new diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma he was followed by his ENT Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] while in house.
It is possible still that the patient may require tracheostomy during his cancer treatment.
Of note, the patient also experienced left upper extremity edema in the last few days during his hospital stay.
An ultrasound revealed a deep venous thrombosis in the left axillary vein extending to the brachial veins.
No deep venous thrombosis was evident in the jugular or subclavians.
secondary to his previous INR goal for atrial fibrillation.
The patient denies any new shortness of breath and reported that his [**Last Name (un) 15883**] symptoms had significantly improved.
Squamous cell carcinoma of the bilateral vocal cords.
Left upper extremity deep venous thrombosis.
Atrial fibrillation.
Congestive heart failure.
Coronary artery disease.
History of PEs status post IVC filter placement.
Albuterol MDI four puffs q 6 hours prn wheezing.
The plan is for the patient to follow up next week with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3311**] at [**Hospital3 328**] Institute for possible treatment of his squamous cell carcinoma.
Most likely the patient's glucose should resolve to normal in the immediate future given that his Decadron has since been discontinued.
The patient is to follow up in the Device Clinic in three months to have his pacemaker checked.
No intervention is required at this time, but follow up so it does not continue to decrease should be continued.
