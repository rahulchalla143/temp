Admission Date:  [**2200-2-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2200-2-19**]   Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Drug Allergy Information on File  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3227**] Chief Complaint: consulted for SDH found on head CT   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 85 male sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ER with mental status changes from the nursing home.
There is no report of a fall or any other trauma.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
He appears to have some neglect on the right side but does move the right side somewhat.
Over the three-day interval, there has been little change in the overall appearance of the heterogeneous but predominantly hyperattenuating lobulated process centered in the extra-axial space of the left parietovertex.
This appears to "mold" to the contour of the subjacent convexity, where there is focal low-attenuation in the immediate subcortical white matter, corresponding to the FLAIR-signal abnormality in this region, which may represent edema secondary to venous congestion, gliosis, or both.
The overall appearance is most suggestive of a partially calcified en plaque meningioma, though there is no specific evidence of "reactive change" in the suprajacent inner table of the skull.
There has been no other short-interval change.
IMPRESSION: No short-interval change in the overall appearance, with the lobulated, predominantly hyperdense, process, in the extra-axial space at the left parietovertex, given its stability and MR [**Date Range **] more likely an en plaque meningioma, partially calcified, accounting for the MR [**First Name (Titles) 16313**] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
Moreover, the findings on both this exam and the recent enhanced MR study raise the serious possibility of at least partial invasion of the immediately subjacent superior sagittal sinus, without definite thrombosis, and possible venous obstruction-related edema in local white matter.
There is enhancement noted in the area of known hemorrhage in the left parieto- occipital region, compared to the pre-contrast sequences done on the prior study.
However, the etiology of enhancement is not clear as there is significant amount of hemorrhage in this location, as seen on the prior CT and MR studies.
Mildly dilated ventricles are visualized, not adequately assessed.
Study significantly limited due to motion artifacts.
Enhancement noted in the left parieto-occipital region, partly extending along the dura, the etiology of which is uncertain, as this is in the region of the known hemorrhage.
Repeat evaluation, after resolution of the hemorrhage can be considered, to evaluate for any underlying vascular or space-occupying lesion.
However, the patient had an MRI which revealed a mass resembling a meningioma.
There was no hemorrhage there.
On [**2-19**] he was also able to take in thin liquids and pureed solids without difficulty.
He had his foley catheter removed on [**2-18**] but had urinary retention.
His medications were optimized due to his mental status changes.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion, lethargy or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
New onset of the loss of function, or decrease of function on one whole side of your body.
You had a foley catheter placed on [**2-18**] due to urinary retention.
