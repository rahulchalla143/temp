multiple paracenteses Abdominal washout.
Therapeutic bronchoscopy.
History of Present Illness: The patient is a 67-year old male who was recently diagnosed with stage T3N1 distal esophageal adenocarcinoma by EUS and biopsy who underwent preoperative chemo/radiation treatment.
Past Medical History: - duodenal ulcer '[**21**]; '[**43**], tx for H pylori '[**52**] - hiatal hernia, gastritis, duodenitis '[**49**] - asthma, exercise induced (well controlled w/ pulmicort, albuterol prn, no O2) - ADHD - s/p MVA w/ depressed skull fx '[**23**] - SBO '70s, managed conservatively - colonic polyps, s/p colonoscopy & excision (adenoma), last colonoscopy '[**58**] - no polyps, hemorrhoids PSH: - s/p appy - s/p ing hernia repair [**5-9**]   Social History: former smoker (1ppd x 10yrs, quit 35yrs), ETOH one wine or beer/day; denies drugs; married w/ 3 children, realtor   Family History: mother w/ gastric or uterine CA '[**00**], s/p surgery, MI - deceased father w/ resp disease, attributed to occupational exposure to dust or mold   Brief Hospital Course: OPERATIONS DURING ADMISSION: [**8-4**]   Transthoracic esophagectomy with cervical anastomosis ([**Last Name (un) 62523**] Procedure).
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (3-hole esophagectomy) [**9-8**]  ex-lap, abdominal wash-out [**9-13**]  abdominal wash-out [**9-22**]  abdominal wash-out, bovine pericardium abdominal closure, VAC dressing placement [**9-24**]  trach placement [**9-26**]  colocutaneous fistula w/leaking feces [**9-26**] s/p vac, skin, and pericardium takedown with bedside placement of red rubber tube in fistula [**10-8**] portacath out, PICC out [**10-8**] bronch neg  CONSULTATIONS DURING ADMISSION: Interventional Pulmonology Acute Pain Service Nephrology Service x2 Surgical ICU Trauma-Surgical ICU General Surgery Infectious Disease cardiology  HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital for known esophageal cancer (T3N1MO) s/p portacath placement and J-tube placement in [**2162-4-8**], followed by neoadjuvant chemo (F5U/cisplatin) and radiation for an esophagectomy with cervical anastomosis ([**Last Name (un) 62523**] procedure).
Postoperatively he went into acute renal failure and was seen by the nephrology service.
He was also seen to develop loculated pleural effusions, and so he had a pigtail placed on [**8-25**]; CXR post placement revealed a right lung fluid in new loculated effusion/ hydropneumothorax towards apex with the left effusion unchanged.
When drainage had decreased significantly and there were no signs of pneumothorax, the patient's left and then right pigtails were removed, which he tolerated well.
Pt given albumin for volume expansion transiently resulting in an increase in BP into the 90s.
Pt was noted to have a burst of SVT with HR in 160s which improved with carotid massage.
[**1-9**] overwhelming nursing concern, transient hypotension, concern for worsening hypercarbia, decrease in mental status, pt transferred to ICU for further management.
Pt intubated for hypercarbia and for fluid management concern as latest cxr revealed volume overload versus underlying pna(no fevers)  [**9-8**] - Pt self-extubated in AM, reintubated in CVICU, was hypotensive, femoral a-line and RIJ triple lumen placed.
Pt taken back to OR for ~5hr exploration as to acute decompensation, bronchoscopy unrevealing, on ex-lap multiple loculated abscesses found and drained, JPs left in place, anastomosis no leak.
Pt hypotensive during abdominal closure --> asystolic arrest, CPR initiated, epi/atropine given --> Vtach, defib into sinus rhythm.
Then had episode of SVT during transfer from OR table to bed -Afib w/ RVR w/ hypotension, cardioverted back to sinus.
Overnight in CVICU had a slight dropoff of UOP and mild hypotension, responded to fluid bolus.
Diuresed to goal of 100cc/hour of urinary output with a CVP greater than 10 and an SBP > 100.
4am RN noticed slightly uneven pupils and less reliable response to voice/command on neuro check.
300cc's of yellow serous fluid drained from site.
For IP drainage of right apical effusion today, if drainage successful chest tube to be d/c'ed by thoracic.
Plan for OR [**9-21**] for possible abdominal closure.
[**9-21**]: Unable to take back to OR, will go back [**9-22**] for closure of negative pressure therapy, d/c'ed versed gtt in favor of intermittent ativan with minimal requirement of usage, TF off after MN/NPO p MN for OR [**9-22**].
[**9-22**] Went back to OR today, DC left chest tubes, dc both JP drains, DC ng tube, placed bovine pericarial matrix on superior portion of wound, and closed the infraumbilical portion.
No OR cultures to follow.
On [**9-26**] the patient was noted to have copious amount of frank green thick feces emanating from his vac dressing.
He was found to have a colocutaneous fistula, from which was emanating the stool.
That day he underwent a CT abd/chest with contrast that revealed leakage of contrast to anterior abdomen from transverse colon; no biliary  dilatation or gallbladder distension.
CT C/A/P w/ small perf transverse colon to anterior abdomen, kept NPO, TPN restarted.
[**9-27**] - no HIDA scan, ostomy nurse creates large vacuum sump for EC fistula, 2UPRBC xfused, TPN continues, no tube study necessary for EC fistula as prior contrast passes distal to the fistula, currently on only Zosyn - added Vanco due to new culture data from cath tip [**9-28**] - Pt taken by IR for placement of cholecystostomy tube.
[**10-5**]: vent regimen to PS20 (from PS25) 2-3x/day for diaphragm exercise.
o/n high peak pressures (PIP 40s, plateau 30s), severe resp acidosis + metab acidosis, anuria/oliguria, back to pressure controlled ventilation 10/31 - hypothermic x 2 (both axillary temps), bedside echo adequate intravascular filling with nl contractility; bronch for elevated airway pressures, no plugs, minimal thin secretions, BAL sent; left IJ placed w/ SvO2 monitoring, SvO2 80s.
Unable to wean off vent - increasing acidemia with HCO3 to low of 15.
The patient also underwent a gastrograffin study that revealed free flow of contrast from the rectum to the distal transverse colon with drainage into the anterior abdominal wound via colocutaneous fistula without evidence for an obstructing lesion in the left colon.
[**10-13**]  The patient's acute renal failure worsened to a creatinine of 3.9 with clonus on exam and concern for uremic encephalopathy as per the renal fellow.
He remained on PCV ventilation but became hypocapnic but also with a low bicarb.
[**10-14**]- [**10-15**] Bilirubin up to 14.7, becoming more jaundiced; had RUQ U/S and evaluation of perc choly tube that was negative for cholecystitis or infection or abnormality of the biliary tract.
Feces out of abdominal fistula.
Open abdomen developed small but persistent area of bleeding lateral and slightly superior to the fistula.
[**10-20**] - VAC dressing applied to abdominal wound by general surgery service [**10-21**] - atrial flutter, low blood pressure.
[**10-22**]: CT torso - no changes/new acute issues very hypotensive, tachycardic overnight, was in A flutter, cardioversion x 2.
Patient continued on pressors, tpn, amiodarone for afib, stable ventilartory setting but continued to have rising liver finction tests and required increased doses of pressors so that he also had a very positive fluid balance for a few days in a row.
