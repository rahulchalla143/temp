Admission Date: [**2136-10-8**]        Discharge Date: [**2136-11-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-8-23**]        Sex:  M  Service:  HEPATOBILIARY SURGERY SERVICE   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 64 year old male who underwent a low anterior resection with coloproctostomy on [**2133-1-16**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for grade 2 adenocarcinoma of the colon who had free margins of resection free of tumor of 0 out of 12 lymph nodes that were positive, developed sternal chest pain.
On further evaluation including laboratory studies patient was noted to have an elevated CEA and abdominal ultrasound performed on [**2136-7-13**] demonstrated two heterogenous masses in the right lobe of the liver measuring 7.3 x 6.3 x 5.5 cm and 6.1 x 5.8 x 4.7 cm.
Patient underwent a CT guided liver biopsy that was interpreted as adenocarcinoma consistent with colonic origin.
Patient also had a PET scan on [**2136-8-6**] that demonstrated two large foci of a hypermetabolic activity in the right lobe of the liver consistent with hepatic metastasis.
There was also a large bone metastasis.
Patient underwent a CT guided biopsy of the sternum on [**2136-8-17**] which was read as no adenocarcinoma.
The chest CT demonstrated one solitary pulmonary nodule in the superior segment of the right lobe at the level of the carina approximately 3 to 4 mm in diameter and it was not determined whether it was granuloma versus metastasis.
Three month follow up was suggested and the CT scan of abdomen demonstrated a lesion on the dome of the right lobe of the liver posteriorly.
The lesion contained some calcification and there was some faint enhancement of the more medial aspect.
Directly inferior to this there was almost inseparable another mass with another poorly marginated area of irregularly decreased attenuation of the multiple foci of the peripheral enhancement which measured 4.5 cm in diameter.
A third lesion was seen in the anterior inferior adjacent to the gallbladder measuring 3.5 cm in diameter.
On [**2136-9-11**] a repeat CT guided biopsy of the sternum was obtained and it was confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma consistent with colonic origin.
No history of intravenous drug use, marijuana use, blood transfusions, tattoos, hepatitis or piercing.
Carotids are 2 plus and 4 plus without bruits.
Patient with normal S1, S2, no S3, S4, murmurs or rubs, regular rate and rhythm.
No edema was noted peripherally.
Patient was determined to have a metachronous metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon to the liver and patient was consented for the right hepatic lobectomy as well as the sternal resection.
Patient remained afebrile with stable vital signs on a drip of Neo-Synephrine and propofol as well as continuing to be intubated with CPAP with good gases and postoperative patient's hematocrit was 33.2 postoperatively with creatinine of 0.6.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12828**] were putting out serosanguineous fluid and the patient was kept sedated overnight.
Patient's pain was well controlled.
On postoperative day number two patient received some bolus for low urine output.
The patient actually failed to extubate because of fluctuating respiration.
On postoperative number four patient continued to remain afebrile with stable vital signs and was neb negative about 500 cc but continues to be edematous.
On postoperative day number five the patient continued to do well, was transferred to the floor, remained afebrile with stable vital signs with a significant amount of [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] output which are continued as well as chest tube output.
On postoperative day number six the patient remained afebrile with stable signs and continued to have a significant edema and significant output from the chest tube and the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12828**] were draining clear ascitic fluid as well.
On postoperative day number 7, however, the patient had significant drop in the sodium to 124 from 129.
Patient's diuresis was stopped and the patient has frequent sodium checks to ensure that there is no continuation in drop in the sodium.
The patient's chest tubes were removed and [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12828**] were continued for high output.
Patient continued to have some drainage from the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**].
On postoperative day 13 the patient remained afebrile with stable vital signs and taking good P.O.
Patient continues to have [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] output and from one of the areas where the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] was removed there was continual leak where an ostomy bag was placed which put out approximately 1.3 liters.
On postoperative day 14 patient remained afebrile with stable vital signs.
Patient continued to have significant output from the drain and there was also an opening at the sternal wound edges where the thoracic service recommended placement of VAC dressing which was performed to allow for good healing of that wound.
Patient also had an ultrasound of the liver to look for portal vein thrombosis which showed that there is no thrombosis of the portal vein or superior mesenteric artery.
On postoperative day 15 patient remained afebrile with stable vital signs making good urine.
Patient also had a MR scan which was negative for any signs of thrombosis of the portal vein.
On postoperative day number 17 the patient continued to remain afebrile with stable vital signs.
On postoperative day number 19 patient had good urine output and remained afebrile with stable vital signs with stable sodium at 137 and on postoperative day 17 patient remained afebrile with stable vital signs making good urine.
Patient's sternal wound was healing well.
On postoperative day number 21 patient remained afebrile with stable vital signs making good urine and improvement in the edema.
On postoperative day number 22 patient was taken to the operating room for the removal of the [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex that was placed in the original sternal resection and the debridement of the sternum with pectoral flap advancement.
The patient remained afebrile with stable vital signs making good urine.
On postoperative day 26 and 4 patient remained afebrile with stable vital signs.
without any difficulties.
On postoperative day 27 and 5 patient remained afebrile with stable vital signs with good urine output.
FINAL DIAGNOSES:  Status post colon cancer with metastasis to liver.
Sternal post sternal debridement and pectoralis major flaps.
