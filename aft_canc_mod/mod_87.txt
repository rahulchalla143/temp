There is no evidence of large intracranial hemorrhage, mass, or mass effect.
A small subarachnoid hemorrhage or extraaxial hematoma cannot be excluded.
No large displaced fracture is evident.
Left frontal osteoma is unchanged in appearance.
No large intracranial hemorrhage identified.
Small subarachnoid hemorrhage or extraaxial hematoma cannot be excluded.
CTA chest: CT CHEST BEFORE AND AFTER IV CONTRAST: The heart size is enlarged with severe coronary artery disease and calcification of the aortic valve.
Atherosclerotic calcifications are also noted in the aorta.
There is extensive pulmonary embolism involving all segments of the right lung.
The appearance of the thrombi is most consistent with acute pulmonary embolism.
There is no radiographic evidence of right heart strain.
There are also no filling defects in the visualized IVC to suggest extension of renal cell carcinoma as a cause for pulmonary embolism.
There is suggestion of several centrilobular and other pulmonary nodules that cannot be further evaluated on the current study.
There is also moderate-to-large right and small-to-moderate left simple, layering pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
No mediastinal or axillary lymphadenopathy is noted.
There is an old healed fracture of the left lateral fifth rib.
There are no regions of bone destruction suspicious for metastasis.
Extensive acute pulmonary embolism in all segments of the right lung.
Several centrilobular and other pulmonary nodules are suggested on this exam limited by motion.
A repeat CT scan as an outpatient after resolution of these acute setting may be warranted.
However, given that PET CT of [**2169-10-28**] was negative for metastatic pulmonary lesion, the likelihood of these nodules representing new metastatic lesions is decreased.
Bilateral pleural effusions with subpulmonic effusions.
Cardiomegaly with severe coronary artery disease.
Cardiac Echocardiogram [**2169-12-5**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %).
There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The aortic stenosis is moderate to severe.
Cardiac cath report: [**2169-12-5**] HISTORY:   73 yo female with a history of lung cancer, metastatic renal cell carcinoma with met to right femur s/p recent reconstruction admitted on [**2169-12-5**] with large right-sided pulmonary embolism with hypoxia for which she was intubated.
With hypotension requiring pressors and ST elevations in V1-V4, concern for STEMI and directed to cath lab with troponin 0.31.
Echo shows EF 15-20% with severe aortic stenosis.
Initial angiography revealed an 80% LM stenosis with damping of the catheter with engagement of the LM and a 70-80% stenosis of the mid LAD as well.
A prowater wire crossed the lesion into the lad with minimal difficulty.
The patient had received iv lytics for her PE in the emergency department and thus she received prophyactic hpearin in the cath lab.
A 3.5x12mm driver stent was deployed in the LM at 16 atm and post dilated with a 4x12mm quantum maverick balloon at 20 atm with excellent result and no evidence of jailing either the lad or lcx.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and timi 3 flow.
The patient remained hypotensive and ventuilated in critical condition.
There was difficulty re-obtaining arterial access but once we did, angiography of LM revealed patent LM stent.
There was absence of flow elsewhere in the left coronary in the setting of an asystolic heart.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed a proximal 80% stenosis in the LMCA.
The LAD had a 70-80% stenosis in the mid portion with a 50% stenosis at the origin of the diagonal.
The LCX had a 60% stenosis at the origin.
OM2 and OM3 were without obstructive disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right-sided filling pressures.
There was a mean gradient of 23 mm Hg across the aortic valve with a calculated area across the aortic valve of 0.73 cm2 consistent with severe aortic stenosis.
Successful LM and LAD stenting with a 3.5x12mm driver stent post dilated to 4.0mm in the LM and a 3.0x24 driver stent posted to 3.0mm in the LAD.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and timi 3 flow.
Subsequent PEA arrest with prolonged but unsuccesful rescusitative efforts.
Severe aortic stenosis.
In the cath lab patient found with 80 % stenosis in the LMCA.
LAD had 70-80% stenosis mid portion and 50% origing of diagonal.
Severe aortic stenosis was found.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and timi 3 flow .
After procedure while transfering patiento to stretcher for transport, patient had a PEA arrest.
Hydromorphone 2 mg [**12-22**] tab PO q4h for pain 13.
