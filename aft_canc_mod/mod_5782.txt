The bilateral basal atelectasis is grossly unchanged with small left more than right amount of pleural fluid.
The patient continues to be in mild failure, although there is no frank pulmonary edema.
No substantial pneumothorax is demonstrated.
Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after establishing intravenous access.
There were no immediate complications.
Bolus formation, control, and tongue movement were severely impaired with consistent premature spillage noted.
Once the pharyngeal swallow was initiated palate elevation, laryngeal elevation and epiglottic deflection were within functional limits.
No episodes of penetration or aspiration were observed throughout today's evaluation though evaluation was very limited by patient positioning.
Solid residue was noted remaining in the mid- to- distal esophagus after the evaluation.
IMPRESSION: Severely prolonged oral phase with no definite evidence of aspiration, though evaluation was limited.
However, her creatinine began to rise and it was felt that we had reached the limit of active diuresis.
At that time, it was noted that she had 3+ MR on a previous echocardiogram which was likely making her heart failure much worse than it appeared to be.
In preparation for surgery she underwent evaluation of her carotids which showed a patent right carotid and a 60-69% stenosis in the left.
Cardiac surgery also recommended an evaluation by GI given her history of GI bleeding and the increased intraoperative risk given the large heparin dose she would get.
She received an EGD with small bowel enteroscopy which showed some small AVMs in the stomach which were cauterized and no further AVMs in the visualized portion of the small bowel.
The gastroenterologists felt that she had a moderate risk of bleeding during perioperative time period.
In discussion with the patient and the cardiac surgeons, it was felt appropriate to continue with the surgery.
She had episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation and was startedon amiodarone, as well as heparin and coumadin.
Seen by ID for continued  leukocytosis of unknown etiology and started on empiric vanco and zosyn.
She was again reintubated on POD #17 for near badycardic near arrest.
She was seen by orthopedic surgery for decreased ROM in her left shoulder.
There were no acute issues found.
Yeast grew from her sputum and urine and she was started on fluconazole.
She had no further episodes of bradycardia and did not require a pacemaker.
Diuresis and volume status continued to be an issue.
She had rapid atrial fibrillation, and was given iv amiodarone and again became bradycardic.
Repeat swallowing evaluation on [**3-24**]  receommended continued nectar thick lequids and pureed foods, as well as small sips of thin liquids and modified barium swallow prior to advancing diet.
She continues on coumadin for atrial fibrillation, and has received 0.5 mg for 4 days.
