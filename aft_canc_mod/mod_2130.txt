The patient was admitted to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab [**2166-3-31**] following an admission to [**Hospital1 882**] for left leg hematoma with INR 19 s/p fasciotomy [**2166-2-22**] which was c/b DVT in hematoma for which she was restarted on coumadin and underwent repeat surgery [**2166-3-24**].
She has noted at the Rehab to have poor po intake for days without a bowel movement in five days.
[**12-26**] large amt of hematemesis, she received 2-3L of fluid in the ED.
She specifically refuses cpr, intubation, EGD, interventional lines, embolization but does want dialysis and blood-products in the short term.

Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for hematemesis/UGIB in setting of anti-coagulation for DVT as well as permanent afib with course complicated by E. Coli bacteremia, rapid afib, hypotension, and respiratory failure requiring intubation.
GI evaluated the patient in the ICU with assessment that the patient should undergo EGD but that it would be better to defer until her repiratory status stabilized given the patient's bleeding was self-limited and there was no evidence for active bleed at that time.
The patient had no repeat episodes of hematemsis throughout the hospital course and her Hct was stable.
In the setting of a supratherapeutic INR the patient did exeprience some bloody discharge from her rectal tube which was self limiting without Hct drop.
The patient continued to have guaiac positive stools but no evidence of rapid bleeding.
Respiratory Failure - The patient appeared to be relatively stable after initial admission to the MICU and was to be transferred to the floor when she began to develop respiratory distress.
Subsequent imaging revealed evidence for volume overload and pulmonary edema.
The patient required intubation on [**4-10**] because of impending respiratory failure.
The patient had multiple spontaneous breathing trials with difficult wean, but was eventually extubated on [**4-13**].
S/p extubation there was some concern for ongoing respiratory insufficiency w/ hypercarbia although the patient was mentating well.
The patient was initially maintained on 2L NC with recent increasing O2 needs to 3L and postional desats.
Repeat chest film demonstrated persist pulmonary vascular congestion but no new infiltrates or consolidation.
More aggressive volume removal has been limited to date by persistent relative hypotension.
Subsequent sensitivites revealed however only partial sensitivity to Zosyn for which Abx therapy was tailored to ceftriaxone, dosed with HD.
However, sputum cultures revealed moderate growth E. Coli which was thought more likely to represent colonizer than respiratory pathogen.
The patient's elevated white count was initially attributed to her known MDS on admission although on discharge from most recent hospitalization on [**2166-1-10**] the patient had a white count of only 14.3.
The patient was subsequently found to have C. Diff which was thought to most likely account for her elevated white count.
The patient was treated with oral Flagyl as well as oral Vancomycin given persistently elevated white count a and is currently on both with planned treatment duration of three weeks.
ID reported additional concern for potential infection of the patient's left thigh hematoma.
Review of records from [**Hospital1 882**] revealed that hematoma aspiration cultures from the patient's second intervention on [**2166-3-24**] demonstrated negative gram stain and no growth on cultures.
A repeat CT of the LLE was performed that demonstrated two hematomas in the medial and anterior thigh, but imaging demonstrated no gas or destructive changes to suggest an active infectious process.
Given this, it was felt that most likely the patient's E. Coli bacteremia was iatrogenic during her MICU stay and repeat aspiration of the patient's hematoma was not performed given concern of actual introduction of infection into this space with sampling.
Patient additionally has a sacral decubitus ulcer.
On transfer to the floor evaluation of sacral decub was not revealing for active infection, there was no purulent drainge or fluctuance associated.
However, despite the patient having a rectal tube in place, given intermittent leakage and soiling, this site likely represents the most life threatening source of infection at time of discharge.
During the hospital course the patient had episodes of occasional RVR with rates in the 140s.
Given history of DVT as well as persistent afib the decision was made to continue anticoagulation but with goal to maintain anti-coagulation at the lower end of therapeutic.
Since placement of tunneled hemodialysis catheter, the patient has begun transition back to coumadin and should continue of Heparin gtt with gaol PTT 50-70 until a therapeutic INR is achieved.
Again, given the history of GI bleeding and thigh hematoma, an INR on the lower range of therapeutic would be recommended, 2.0 to 2.5.
As above, the patient was transfused 2U PRBCs in the ICU in the setting of hematemesis but had otherwise stable Hct since transfer to the floor.
ESRD: As previous in the setting of volume overload and respiratory failure the patient was receiving qd dialysis for volume removal upon establishment of euvolemia the patient continued to recieve HD as needed.
The patient initially developed transient hypotension post-dialysis likely related to volume shifts.
The patient was given small boluses as needed and efforts were maintained to control heart rate as above.
However, over the hospital course the patient was noted to develop persistent hypotension.
This occurred in the setting of poor po intake, increase in rate control meds, and concern for possible impending sepsis.
DM2 - The patient was maintained with Lantus 5 Units at breakfast with additional ISS with generally tight glycemic control, with most sugars < 180.
Over last few days with improving PO intake patient's sugars have been increasing with increase in Glargine to 8 units.
Left Leg Hematoma - The patient was admitted with known prior left thigh hematoma s/p fasciotomy and evacuation at [**Hospital1 882**].
Inital hematoma occured in the setting of INR of 18.
Surgery was consulted with assessment that there was no indication for evacuation of hematoma given there were no neurologic or vascular deficits.
No air was seen in these collections, nor were there any destructive changes to the surrounding tissues.
Given this as well as concern for actually introducing infection with sampling, decision was made not to aspirate fluid from the hematoma this admission for cultures.
Myeloproliferative disorder - The patient was admitted with known diagnosis of a MPD.
As previous, the patient had a persistent leukocytosis throughout this hospitalization with question of whether this represented an infectious source or the patient's known MPD.
Heme pathology was asked to prepare a peripheral blood smear for review.
It was felt that there was no significant left shift or toxic granulations to suggest infection and that the elevated white count may be consistent with her underlying MPD, although the possibility that an uderlying infection could have caused demargination could not be ruled out.
The patient was continued on her outpatient treatmet regimen of Anagrelide for thrombocythemia with platelet counts < 400K.
Hypotension - Please note on transfer that patient at baseline has had persistent baseline hypotension with SBP rangin 80-100.
The patien has received few 250cc boluses as needed but aggressive volume repletion has not been attempted given ESRD and patient's DNR/DNI status with evidence previously for pulmonary edema.
There were many conversations with regards to code status with many reversals throughout the patient's hospitalization.
However, upon conversation with patient's family and patient, this decision was reversed and the patient was acutally intubated this admission for respiratory failure.
