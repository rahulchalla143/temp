Lung mass/Hemoptysis: The patient was transferred from OSH with know endocronchial mass lesion which was identified for evaluation of hemoptysis.
Bronchoscopy on [**9-24**] showed an endobronchial mass consistent with possible carcinoid tumor by appearance.
The patient did not report symptoms consistent with carcinoid syndrome other than some diarrhea.
Differential diagnosis of the mass also includes other neoplasm vs. infection.
No other lesions were identified during bronchoscopy.
Gram stain from BAL showed 1+ PMNs with no organisms seen.
The patient was initially placed on TB precautions given history of nightsweats and hemoptysis but induced sputum was negative and BAL negative on concentrated smear.
The patient has follow up appointment with Interventional Pulmonary in place to review findings of bronch as well as to coordinate plans for ongoing management.
HTN: Patient initially presented with BP of 240/160 at OSH with no evidence of end-organ damage.
A number of labs for secondary causes including Renin, Aldosterone, Metanephrines are pending at the time of discharge although more likely etiologies for patient's hypertension include longstanding idiopathic hypertension (undetected due to lack of consistent medical care) as well as possible alcohol withdrawal.
Antibiotics were discontinued given no definite evidence of infection on arrival.
The patient remained afebrile without leukocytosis or worsening pulmonary symptoms through multiple day hospital course.
EtOH abuse: The patient has a history of significant EOTH use with evidence of fatty liver and possible grade 1 varcies at OSH.
Abnormal CT: Chest CT performed for hemoptysis revealed a 3 mm lung nodule was seen in the LLL, separate from the patient's known lesion, as well as a low-density attenuation in the right kidney thought to represent a myoleiolipoma.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Endobronchial mass Hemoptysis Hypertensive Urgency .
Patient's blood pressure still above goal but better controlled with plan for ongoing titration of BP meds as outpatient (do not want to normalize rapidly given likely long standing hypertension)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with blood in your sputum, elevated blood pressure and a mass that was identified in one of your airways.
You were also evaluated for Tuberculosis with no evidence that you have TB at this time.
There was a small long nodule seen on your chest CT in addition to your known airway mass.
There was also a small nodule in your right kidney that was difficult to characterize and can also be reevaluated with the repeat CT in 12 months.
