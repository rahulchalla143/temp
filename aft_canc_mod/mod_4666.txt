The hx is very limited given the patient being uncooperative and limited info provided by her boyfriend.
Talked with her boyfriend who lives with her who states that she started to complain of headache yesterday.
He also states that she was complaining of left hand numbness for months/ ?
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Oriented to self, and [**2113**] but does not answer when asked month or recent holidays.
The tone is decreased in the Left side and the reflexes are brisker on the left.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.

No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast (rest injection only).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The large right frontal infarction as well as multiple scattered smaller right frontal and parietal ischemic infarcts appear to be embolic in nature.
Given associated T2 hyperintensity and significant mass effect with midline shift, the infarcts are likely subacute (days old).
There is no hydrocephalus, no evidence of herniation and no hemorrhagic transformation of the infarct.
Extra-axial mass originating from the right petroclival dura which is extending into the right cavernous sinus.
While this lesion most likely represents a meningioma, differential diagnosis includes a dural-based metastasis, tuberculosis, or sarcoid.
The mass appears to encase the cavernous segment of the right ICA and causes severe stenosis.
These findings should be further assessed by MRA of head and neck.
MRA [**2113-11-17**]: IMPRESSION: Occlusion of the right internal carotid in the neck with reconstitution in the intracranial region.
No significant change in large right frontal lobe infarction.
Additional smaller right frontal and parietal infarcts are better seen on prior MR. 2.
No evidence of hemorrhagic transformation.
No definite central herniation.
High grade (>95%) stenosis of the origin of the right internal carotid artery, with "string sign" more distally.
No evidence of hemorrhagic conversion or new infarct in other regions.
Similar degree of mass effect causing subfalcine herniation, effacement of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], and 13-mm leftward shift of midline structures, possibly 1 mm less than two days ago without significant change.
CT HEAD [**2113-11-26**]: IMPRESSION: Interval evolution of infarction with mildly decreased but persistent edema and decreased leftward shift of midline structures.
No evidence of hemorrhagic conversion.
Brief Hospital Course: 48yo F with HTN who presented with headache and was found to have multiple strokes in the ACA/MCA territory, on admission thought likely embolic, also had cerebral edema and 11mm midline subfalcine shift likely secondary to ischemic stroke.
Although she was intermittently oriented x3, she became somewhat paranoid and very disinhibited likely as a result of her strokes.
In terms of motor strength, she had left sided face/arm/leg weakness that were stable.
Repeat CT scans of her head revealed slightly increase midline shift without hemorrhage.
Stroke workup revealed 95% stenosis of her right ICA as well as  and incidental meningioma around intracranial ACA that Nsurg decline to operate on and will follow up on in brain tumor clinic.
She was started on heparin Gtt for the stenosis and then bridged to coumadin.
Her repeat head CT on [**11-26**] showed improved edema and size of the infarct.
Therefore we felt that the most likely cause of her stroke was from her 95% R ICA stenosis.
She was treated with fioricet for her HA while here.
# CVS: No afib noted on tele, BP allowed to autoregulate from 120-160 with hydral prn.
# Nutrition: She passed swallow eval and was started on a limited oral diet but intermittently refused food given paranoia about poisoning.
Eventually her paranoia improved and she continued to eat a soft diet.
