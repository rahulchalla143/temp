Mr. [**Known lastname **] was recently D/C'd from [**Hospital1 18**] after admission for ARF and dehydration felt [**2-9**] overdiuresis.
Per NH notes, patient noted to have increasing pulmonary crackles 3 days PTA and was given an additional 80 mg PO of Lasix.
Worsening pulmonary crackles were noted this AM, and patient received an additional Lasix 40 mg IV X 1 in addition to usual 80 mg PO.
4 lbs weight gain noted over weekend.
Stable 2-pillow orthopnea, no PND.
Mild cough, non-productive.
No rhinorrea, no sore throat.
No N/V, no diaphoresis, no abdominal pain.
CXR without CHF or pneumonia.
Hypertension 4.
Myelodysplastic syndrome with anemia (baseline Hct 29-31) and thrombocytopenia (baseline plt 25-30) 6.
H/o lung cancer s/p resection in [**2155**].
No chemo or XRT.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: VITALS: T 97.2, BP 122/74, HR 87, RR 23, saturation 100%on 5L NC GEN: Mild respiratory distress with abdominal muscle use.
S/a dried blood around mouth.
Carotid pulse with somewhat decreased amplitude.
No carotid bruit appreciated.
RESP: Poor air entry with decreased breath sounds bilaterally.
No bronchial breathing.
Abdomen soft and non-tender.
[**2-10**]+ pitting edema bilaterally up to groin, LLE>RLE (chronic per patient and review of records).
No acute ischemic changes versus 12/[**2162**].
There is moderate cardiomegaly.
The appearance of the right lung is unchanged, with right lower lobe costophrenic angle pleural thickening and faint lower lobe linear opacities.
There is no evidence of congestive heart failure.
No new opacities are present.
No acute infiltrates and no evidence of congestive heart failure.
Note is made of mild congestive heart failure.
Note is made of patchy opacity in the right lower lobe, which may represent atelectasis versus pneumonia.
No pneumothorax is noted.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, mild CHF, and small right pleural effusion.
Opacity in the right lower lobe, representing atelectasis versus pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 89 year-old male with multiple medical problems including CHF with EF 35%, severe AS, severe MDS with thrombocytopenia, chronic atrial fibrillation on Coumadin on admission, HTN and DM type 2, admitted with weight gain and increasing pulmonary rale, as well as severe thrombocytopenia.
1) CHF: Patient with known CHF with an EF of 35% in [**2162-8-8**], likely as a complication of HTN and severe AS.
He is chronically fluid overloaded with a tenuous intravascular volume status in the setting of AS, and aggressive diuresis in the past has resulted in dehydration and ARF.
On admission, he was felt to be likely in mild CHF, and was given Lasix 40 mg IV X 1 in ED.
Lasix was temporarily held in the setting of low BP and likely GI bleed (see below) but resumed on [**2163-1-19**] and titrated to TID dosing.
He will need daily weights and careful monitoring of his fluid balance, with extra Lasix as needed for >= 3 lbs weight gain as BP tolerates.
2) Wheezing: Patient had significant wheezing in hospital, felt likely cardiac asthma, treated with standing Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.
Despite bronchodilator therapy and diuresis, he continued to have wheezing and SOB, but saturation stable on room air.
Repeat CXRs were suggestive of mild CHF, no clear infiltrate.
On [**2163-1-18**], however, Hct 33--> 24 in the setting of severe thrombocytopenia and INR 1.9, and patient noted to have 1 episode of melena.
He was transferred to the ICU for close observation and possible EGD.
He had 1 further episode of melena in the ICU, none on the floor.
On admission, patient had mild troponin elevation, felt likely troponin leak in the setting of CHF, RF.
EKG was without acute ischemic changes.
While in hospital, Imdur was D/C'd given his severe AS, and he was started on low-dose Metoprolol 25 mg PO BID.
According to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 141**], patient deemed a poor surgical candidate for valve replacement.
5) MDS: Patient with severe MDS, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] as an out-patient.
6) Atrial fibrillation: Patient with chronic atrial fibrillation on Coumadin on admission.
After discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 141**] and primary team, decision was taken to D/C long-term anticoagulation in the setting of likely GI bleed, severe thrombocytopenia and fall risk.
7) DM type 2: Glyburinde was held and he was kept on RISS in hospital, with fair glycemic control.
8) Chronic renal insufficiency: Per OMR records, baseline creatinine 1.1-1.5.
Regular insulin sliding scale [**Hospital1 **]   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Congestive Heart Failure Gastrointestinal bleed Myelodysplastic syndrome Coronary artery disease Aortic stenosis Diabetes mellitus type 2 Chronic renal insufficiency   Discharge Condition: Patient stable at discharged.
Of note, we have stopped Imdur and have started Metoprolol 25 mg twice daily.
Please contact your PCP should you develop any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, bright red blood per rectum, or shortness of breath.
