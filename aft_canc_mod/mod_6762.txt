Admission Date:  [**2177-4-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2177-5-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-4-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9853**] Chief Complaint: Hemoptysis DVT  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC placement Transfusion of packed red blood cells Ventilator use (hooked up to tracheostomy) IVC filter placement IR coiling of laryngeal artery Tooth extraction  History of Present Illness: This is a 67 yo man w/ HTN, CVA, COPD, hyponatremia, EtOH abuse, and SCC of the larynx s/p coil embolization of right inferior thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleed [**3-/2177**], s/p tracheostomy and PEG [**3-/2177**], recently discharged to rehab from MICU [**Location (un) **], who was admitted to the floor on [**4-29**] for right LE DVT.
His right leg has become more warm and edematous, with mild pain, compared to the left x3 days, and LENIs showed a right partially occluded distal femoral and popliteal DVT.
Given his recent bleed, anticoagulation was not started, and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for consideration of an IVC filter.
Also completing course of antibiotics for suspected aspiration pneumonia from prior admission.
While on the floor early morning of [**4-30**] he started coughing and was noted to have bleeding from his trache.
He did not have any respiratory difficulties, and ~150cc of blood was suctioned out through the trach, the cuff was inflated for airway protection and he was transfered to MICU green for monitoring.
Given that his bleeding has been attributed to his mass, he is being transfered to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] ICU for ongoing care while he initiates XRT to his mass.
Denies CP, SOB, palpitations, change in chronic productive cough.
No other bleeding.
Currently pain free.
Past Medical History: Cerebrovascular accident, treated at [**Hospital1 2025**] [**2157**] with residual gait weakness Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Hypertension Gout Hyponatremia SCC of the larynx diagnosed [**2177-3-31**], s/p coil embolization of right inferior thryroid artery for hypopharangeal bleed S/p tracheostomy and peg [**2177-4-1**] at [**Hospital1 34**] EtOH abuse  Social History: Former smoker quit at day of dx, EtOH 14 beers daily up until 1 month ago.
RRR No m/r/g Resp: Coarse rhonchorous BS throuhgout.
No HSM Ext: 2+RLE edema to upper calf with erythema.
Trace edema LLE Neuro: AAOx3.
Imaging Studies: [**4-30**] Procedure: IMPRESSION: Prominent bilateral superior thyroidal arteries and left inferior thyroidal artery supplying hypervascular oropharyngeal mucosa.
Successful embolization of blood supply to hypervascular tumor via the bilateral superior thyroidal arteries and left inferior thyroidal artery.
No acute intracranial process; specifically no evidence for enhancing masses.
Bilateral maxillary sinus mucosal disease.
Extensive hypopharyngeal mass appearing similar to prior with evaluation of supraglottic extension difficult.
No obvious lymphadenopathy.
Persistent left vertebral artery nonvisualization and plaque in the left carotid bifurcation.
New multifocal ground-glass opacity and consolidation in left lung, mostly in the peribronchial and peripheral distribution, with one wedge shaped peripheral opacity.
Findings are nonspecific but could be due to infection such as angioinvasive fungus (for example, mucormycosis); hemorrhage; or, alternatively, with history of DVT, this could reflect infarct from non- visualized pulmonary embolism.
Thickening and calcification of the anterolateral wall of the trachea and both mainstem bronchi, could be idiopathic or related to relapsing polychondritis.
Diffuse bronchial wall thickening, slightly more prominent on the left associated with left lower lobe mucoid impaction could be related to infection or inflammation.
Minimal emphysema.
Moderate left and small right pleural effusion.
Small pericardial effusion.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
Enlargement of main pulmonary artery, suggesting possible pulmonary hypertension.
Severe calcifications of the left main coronary artery.
Secretions in the carina and both mainstem bronchi, which could be blood in setting of tracheal bleed.
Please see separately dictated neck CT.     Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 67 year old man with history of HTN, CVA, COPD, status post recent diagnosis of SCC of larynx status post coil embolization of right inferior thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleed [**3-/2177**], status post trach and PEG [**3-/2177**], recently discharged to rehab approximately 1 month ago, who initially presented and was admitted to the floor on [**4-29**] for right LE DVT, with subsequent complicated hospital course for bleeding at tracheostomy site.
# Bleeding from tracheostomy site:  24 hours after admission to floor, patient was noted to have coughing and bleeding from his tracheostomy site.
He went to IR for IVC filter placement to address his DVT, at which time he also underwent coiling of a thyroid artery.
# Right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis: Patient was admitted to the floor on [**4-29**] for right lower extremity DVT.
He was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] with above for consideration of IVC filter (as no plans for anti-coagulation given recent hypopharyngeal bleed).
He successfully underwent placement of IVC filter in IR on [**4-30**] without complication.
# Laryngeal Cancer:  As above, complicated by recurrent bleeds, now status post 2 coil artery embolizations, status post trach and PEG.
# Aspiration pneumonia:  He has a history of aspiration PNA on admission and completed a 10-day course of ceftaz and Vanco on the day after admission.
Likely secondary to bleed and inflammation.
Iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.
# Hyponatremia:  Chronic, improved over the course of his hospitalization.
# Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  Continued home nebulizers PRN.
# Status post cerebrovascular accident:  There were no active issues.
He is not on aspirin due to bleeding risk.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One Hundred (100) mg PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
