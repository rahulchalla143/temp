HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a pleasant 73-year-old gentleman with a past medical history significant for multiple myeloma, peptic ulcer disease, cholangitis, iron deficiency anemia, B12 deficiency anemia, status post cholecystectomy and appendectomy, who was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] from [**Hospital3 **] for an ERCP.
The patient had an ERCP that was done on [**2-9**], and had a stent placed with no significant findings except for mild dilatation, but no stones or strictures.
A MRI that was done after [**2-9**] showed abnormal tissue in the region of porta hepatis and some lymphadenopathy.
During the ERCP procedure, the initial contrast revealed an amorphous intraductal mass.
With further manipulation and extraction of the mass, there was an old blood clot and once the blood clot was removed, bright red blood began to drain from the biliary system.
An A-gram was done that showed no active bleeding, however, the stent that was placed in the common bile duct was no longer there.
The patient was then transferred to the floor after the hematocrit had been stable for greater than 24 hours and there was no evidence of any new acute bleed.
Peptic ulcer disease.
Iron deficiency anemia.
B12 deficiency anemia.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his brother, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], and the patient denies any alcohol, smoking, or IV drug abuse at this time.
General: Comfortable, in no acute distress.
Cardiovascular:  S1, S2 slightly tachycardic, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops heard.
Abdomen is soft, nondistended, mild tenderness in the epigastric area to deep palpation, decreased bowel sounds.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Skin:  No evidence of any rash.
The patient also had a repeat CT angiogram for pancreatic protocol that was done on [**2-23**], and it was found that there was no evidence of any mass and patient had a dilated common bile duct with wall thickening and enhancement which is consistent with either hemobilia or cholangitis.
However, patient's findings were most likely secondary to his hemobilia since he did have a bleed after his ERCP.
In addition, the CT angiogram did show extensive bony involvement of his multiple myeloma.
During the hospital course, the patient did not seem to have any right upper quadrant tenderness or epigastric tenderness that would be concerned with cholangitis, and on the date of discharge, he was sent with Levaquin 500 mg po q day for seven additional days.
Oncology:  The patient has a history of multiple myeloma, and as per the CT angiogram, it appears that there is extensive metastases to the bones.
However, the patient would prefer to let it be as it is, and did not appear to be interested in any chemotherapy, or radiation therapy, or even talking to an oncologist during this hospital course.
