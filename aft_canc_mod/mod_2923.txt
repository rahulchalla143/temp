HIs renal failure resolved with hydration and his creatinine was back to basline at 2-2.4.
CT revealed LLL mass for which he had a bronchoscopy on [**3-18**] which showed a large exophytic mass engulfed in clot(old, no active bleed) at LLL bronchus at the level of secondary carina.
ON that evening, he became hypoxic(low 80s on 4L) and tachypneic with unchanged EKG.
CXR showed pulmonary edema with no collapse/PTX.

There is consolidation of the left lower lobe with mass in the left hilar area.
There is probably a small bilateral pleural effusion.
CXR [**3-20**]: Limited chest x-ray demonstrating cardiac enlargement and findings suggestive of congestive heart failure.
In this patient with history of lung mass, there is a questionable opacity at the right apex for which standard PA and lateral chest radiographs are suggested as well as comparison to the patient's outside films.
CXR [**3-21**]: Interval placement of right IJ central venous catheter in satisfactory position with no pneumothorax seen on this supine radiograph.
Persistent CHF and left lower lobe consolidation/collapse.
Endobronchial biopsy (A):    Predominantly necrotic tissue with rare atypical cells.
Frozen section diagnosis made by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as: "Endobronchial biopsy; extensive necrotic tissue; few atypical cells, suspicious for malignancy.
Respiratory type epithelium with mild atypia".
Rigid bronchoscopy.
Tumor destruction and Argon plasma coagulation.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Tumor eminating from the basilar left lower lobe.
General anesthesia was instituted.
Once an adequate level of anesthesia was reached, the patient was intubated easily with a bronchoscope 12-13mm and thorough examination of the tracheobronchial tree was done flexibly.
The left main stem proximally is patent, but there was 85% distal obstruction from a tumor eminating from the lower lobe.
At that moment, the left lower lobe was opened and there was evidence of tumor emanating mostly from the basilar segments.
Hypoxia: The pt was felt to be hypoxic secondary to a post-obstructive pneumonia (LLL consolidation on CXR), superimposed on lungs damaged by COPD.
He did not appear to be in CHF and actually appeared volume depleted on exam.
He underwent a bronchoscopy which revealed a LLL tumor completely obstructing his bronchus.
They excised the tumor and destroyed it with APC, wiht resultant patent airways (did not require a stent.)
He intermittently became hypoxic to the 70s-low 80s, which was felt to be due to his pneumonia and COPD.
He was continued on atrovent and albuterol nebulizers as well as a salmeterol inhaler.
Hypotension:  He became hypotensive and febrile a day after admission, and was transferred to the MICU.
He was not given an ACE due to his renal failure.
Hx of ischemic cardiomyopathy:  His ACE was held due to renal failure.
He had no signs of failure on his exam here, although one night his sats acute dropped to the low 80s and he was given Lasix.
This was felt to be due to prerenal physiology.
The next day, he had an episode of melena/dark red blood per rectum.
Electrolytes:  He developed hypernatremia to 155 after he was given Lasix and put out 3 liters in a day.
It was likely due to ICU delirium vs. hypernatremia.
He understands that her has a terminal illness and at times said he did not want to be intubated or rescusiated.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 25750**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Lung CA Pneumonia Ischemic cardiomyopathy Acute Renal Failure   Discharge Condition: stable, O2 saturations in low 90s with 40% face tent  Discharge Instructions: Call your doctor or come back to the emergency room if you experience dizziness, palpitations, coughing up blood, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, decreased urine output, or any other concerns.
