Significant interval increase in the size of the large left upper lobe mass as well as interval worsening of the liver and splenic metastases.
Diffuse septal thickening, which may relate to congestive heart failure.
Lymphangitic spread of tumor cannot be excluded.
Mottled appearance of the iliac bones, which may relate to metastatic lesions.
ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
LV systolic function appears moderately depressed with global hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable for review) of [**2152-10-12**], biventricular abnormalities are new and mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation are now significantly worse.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted for sepsis and started on the MUST protocol.
Source of infection felt to be from the lungs, as pt with stage 4 lung cancer with rapidly growing tumor.
Felt to have post obstructive PNA.
It was felt that his cancer was end stage and no further treatment was available given the extent of his disease.
But only lasted about 30 minutes before he became severely acidotic and required reintubation.
Given poor prognosis due to the cancer, pt decided he wanted no further treatment and requested comfort measures only.
