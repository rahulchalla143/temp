The patient was recently admitted to Neurosurgery after presenting with 10 days of a left visual field cut and a progressive feeling as if she were falling to her left, especially when leaning over to pick things up.
An MRI showed a solid and cystic enhancing mass lesion in the medial right parietal lobe.
Further metastitic work up showed a 1.5 cm cystic nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid gland for which she underwent a needle biopsy.
On [**2103-6-15**] she underwent a right-sided superior parietal craniotomy for resection of the tumor with pathology that revealed glioblastoma multiforme.
She had been doing reasonably well (with minor symptoms from initiating chemo including hair loss and fatigue) until the day prior to admission when she developed the acute onset of chest pain.
She describes this pain as a pressure sensation located across her chest, which is worse when she takes a deep breath and when she lies flat.
She also reports dyspnea and breathing faster over the last day as well.
She has had night sweats for the last five days and developed low grade fevers 2-3 days ago.
No cough or wheezing.
No PND or edema.
No difficulty swallowing, acid reflux, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.
In the ED, the patient was noted to have a fever to 100.9.
The ED did an ultrasound that did not reveal evidence of a pericardial effusion.
Brain tumor, s/p resection [**2103-6-15**], pathology showed a glioblastoma multiforme, grade IV/IV, miB-fraction was 22%.
90% of the tumor resected 2.
Right breast lump 15 yrs ago, benign   Social History: The patient is not married and has no children.
Her mother died of lung cancer at age 84, her father had [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer age 68, and her brother had melanoma.

STUDIES: CXR: Low lung volumes bilaterally.
Likely small bilateral pleural effusions.
[**7-20**] CTA chest: No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
Aneurysmal ectasia of the aortic root, which measures 4.1 x 3.7 cm.
Areas of scattered ground-glass opacity, interlobular septal thickening, and atelectasis (c/w CHF) .
[**7-20**] CXR: Low lung volumes bilaterally.
Likely small bilateral pleural effusions.
Micro: [**7-20**] bcx pending; [**7-20**] U/A (-) .. [**7-23**] TTE:  No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Seen by cardiology, TTE showed small effusion but no evidence of tamponade.
had no SOB or lightheadedness.
2) Hypoxia: Improved over stay in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], decreased O2 requirement after thoracentesis - likely related to atelectasis and pleural effusion.
Pulmonary embolism originally considerer - CTA and LENI's both were negative.
4) Anemia of chronic disease: Currently stable, nemia of chronic disease (with possible contributor of temozolomide).
5)Atrial fibrillation: metoprolol 12.g mg po bid, digoxin 0.125 mg po qd; has resolved and not had AF day of discharge, may resolve completely when pericarditis resolves.
Digoxin 125 mcg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily): Please have your digoxin level checked when you see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**7-31**].
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
