No acute intracranial process.
Stable findings of chronic small vessel ischemic changes and old prior right cerebellar infarct.
There is minimal streaky density at the lung bases consistent with subsegmental atelectasis or scarring, as before.
A bipolar transvenous pacemaker is present as demonstrated earlier.
There is no acute change.
IMPRESSION: No acute change.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral wall and hypokinesis of the mid to distal anterior septum and anterior wall.
There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study ([**Month/Day/Year **] echo - limited images reviewed) of [**2106-2-18**], the above mentioned wall motion abnormalities were present in a milder form on the prior echo.
TEE [**2106-4-14**]: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior hypokinesis.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No valvular vegetations or perivavlar abcesses seen.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild focal left ventricular dysfunction with basal to mid wall hypokinesis.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 64-year-old gentleman with metastatic RCC, SSS s/p pacemaker, history of seizure x 1, who is transferred here from [**Hospital6 33**] for an episode of syncope, agonal breathing, and cyanosis.
#) Syncope/Ventricular Tachycardia: Initially his symptoms appeared consistent with cardiac etiology (history of sick sinus syndrome, no prodrome, "drop attack," cyanosis).
After the patient defervesced in the ICU, he had no further episodes of ventricular tachycardia.
# Sepsis/Cellulitis: when he became febrile and hypotensive, he also developed areas of erythema and induration around the sites of prior venipuncture, and he was transferred to the ICU for further management.
Infectious disease was consulted and recommended a 4 week course of IV antibiotics due to his bacteremia complicated by septic thrombophlebitis.
Hand surgery was consulted for evaluation of the septic thrombophlebitis of his hand, an ultrasound was done that showed only superficial involvement, and they recommended conservative management.
# HTN:  Patient was continued on lisinopril and metoprolol, though this was discontinued upon admission to the MICU.
# Thrombocytopenia: During his course in the MICU, the patient's platelets gradually trended down to a nadir of 66 from an admission level of 141.
[**Hospital3 8974**] Bacteremia complicated by superficial thrombophlebitis 2.
Sustained ventricular tachycardia .
Hypertension 2.
Metastatic papillary renal cell cancer on chemo (initially diagnosed [**2103**]) 3.  syncope, SSS s/p pacer (DDD) in [**2091**], generator change in [**2092**] 4.
You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from an outside hospital because of syncope and nausea.
You most likely had a heart arrythmia, which caused you to lose consciousness.
Shortly after your admission you were found to have a fever, areas of redness on your right hand/left arm and then had blood cultures that showed bacteria growing in your blood stream.
While in the ICU when you had a fever it was found that your heart went into an abnormal rhythm called ventricular tachycardia.
The electrophysiologists (heart rhythm doctors) saw you and felt that the abnormal heart rhythm was likely related to the infection.
After you finish your course of antibiotics for the bacteria in your bloodstream, you will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 120**] to discuss putting in a defibrillator.
STARTED Loperamide 2mg every 4 hours as needed for diarrhea .
Return to the hospital if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope or near syncope, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bright red blood in urine or stool, fevers, chills, or any other concerning signs or symptoms.
