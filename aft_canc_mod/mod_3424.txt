Past Medical History: Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, Osteopenia, GERD, Hypthyrodism s/p thyroidectomy, Diverticulosis, Glaucoma, s/p TAH, s/p craniotomy [**2128**] for Glioma  Social History: Resides at home with daughter.

FINDINGS: There is a large heterogeneously enhancing lesion, in the left posterior temporal and the occipital lobes, extending to the splenium of the corpus callosum as well as into the periatrial region, not significantly changed, compared to the most recent CT scan allowing for the technical differences.
There is minimal shift of the midline structures to the right side, not significantly changed.
Continued mass effect, on the atrium and posterior part of the body of the left lateral ventricle and effacement of the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and sulci, unchanged.
Large heterogeneous lesion, in the left posterior temporal and the occipital lobes, extending into splenium, with mass effect on the left lateral ventricle, may relate to glioma/radiation necrosis, demonstrated for surgical planning, not significantly changed.
There are postoperative changes in the left occipital lobe including a post op cavity.
There is some hemorrhage within the operative bed.
There is residual enhancement in the left occipital lobe and temporal lobe with enhancement extending into the splenium of the corpus callosum.
There is a small amount of restricted diffusion along the margins of the ostoperative cavity and within the enhancing tumor mass in the temporal lobe.
This could represent foci of acute ischemia.
There is dural enhancement in the left hemisphere which is likely postoperative in nature.
There is a small subgaleal fluid collection on the left.
There is bilateral mastoid opacification.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was electively admitted on [**2-15**] for excision of recurrent mass in the left occipital lobe.
