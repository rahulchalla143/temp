Admission Date:  [**2197-5-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2197-6-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2143-12-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**] Chief Complaint: Somnolence.
History of Present Illness: (History obtained from medical record as patient was unresponsive on arrival.)
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 33754**] is a 53-year-old right-handed woman, previously healthy, with a  left basal ganglia tumor causing increasing somnolence and deteriorating neurological status.
A heaad CT at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital that same day showed left frontal edema.
She was discharged home 3 days later without complications but developed a right-sided facial droop and weakness on [**2197-5-8**].
An MRI at that time at [**Hospital1 756**] and Woman's showed left basal ganglia and left frontal enhancement.
She began vomiting and had increased right-sided weakness, dysarthria, and lethargy while at rehabilitation and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2197-5-31**].
She had a positive FDG-PET scan and a CT scan showing a 1.5 cm x 2.6 cm hyperdense lesion in the left frontal/basal ganglia region with extensive surrounding edema, 10 mm midline shift, and slight effacement of the left suprasellar cistern indicate possibly early uncal herniation.
She underwent a second biopsy on [**2197-6-2**], the prelimary pathology from which was reportedly most consistent with CNS lymphoma.
The gram stain from the biopsy was negative for PMNs or organisms.
Staining for toxoplasma was negative.
She was continued on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis (has not had any seizure activity), and Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis per ID recommendation.
She was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] of Neuro-Oncology who recommended transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for observation and initiation of high-dose methotrexate therapy on [**2197-6-5**].
Past Medical History: HTN Hyperlipidemia Oophorectomy at young age  Social History: Lives with husband.
GENERAL: Unarousable, non-verbal HEENT: Right pupil 6 mm, L pupil 5 mm, reactive CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular but bradycardic with normal S1 and S2, but no murmur, clicks, or gallops PULMONARY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly no w/r/r  ABDOMEN: Obese, soft, non-tender, non-distended, positive bowel sounds EXTREMITIES: Warm, dry, positive pedal pulses, trace edema bilaterally  NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: Her Karnofsky Performance Score is 50.
She does not have doll's eyes.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2197-6-2**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Shift of normally midline structures by approximately 10 mm is noted.
Significant increase in size, degree of surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect with effacement of the left perimesencephalic cistern, consistent with uncal herniation, indicating early uncal herniation.
Right maxillary sinus disease with fluid level again identified.
[**2197-6-4**] CT head - No significant change in the degree of mass effect or herniation secondary to a hyperattenuating lesion involving the left putamen and globus pallidus.
Given that this lesion crosses the midline via the corpus callosum, the differential diagnosis is most suggestive of either lymphoma or glioblastoma multiforme.
Slight improvement in mass effect related to known left frontal lymphoma, including slightly decreased shift of midline structures to the right, and slightly decreased left subfalcine herniation.
Slight reexpansion of the left lateral ventricle.
Persistent trapping of the right lateral ventricle, with slightly decreased dilatation of the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
The cardiac silhouette remains within normal limits and there is only mild prominence of pulmonary vessels consistent with a slight elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.

CNS Lymphoma: This was diagnosed by brain biopsy on [**2197-6-2**], HIV and toxoplasma staining were negative.
Initial CT scan with mass, shift, edema and possible early herniation.
Her last head CT done on [**2197-6-10**] demonstrated improvement in mass effect and decreased midline shift, with unchanged left uncal herniation.
She was kept on Keppra 500 mg po bid for seizure prophylaxis.
Gram Positive Cocci in Blood: This is likely contaminant, but clinical status improved significantly on vancomycin.
Also had corynebacterium in urine on [**2197-6-10**], which was felt to be covered by vancomycin.
Hypertension: Continued on Lisionpril, hydrochlorothiazide and low dose metoprolol added for intermittent tachycardia (mostly associated with delirium).
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
Senna 8.8 mg/5 mL Syrup Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 1293**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Central nervous system lymphoma Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Thrush Bacteremia  Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from an outside hospital with confusion and difficulty writing.
Upon your arrival here, you had a brain biopsy (brain test) that showed that you have a cancer called brain lymphoma.
You were also started on treatment for your lymphoma with a drug called methotrexate by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**].
You continued to have difficulty moving the right side of your body.
Because of the swelling in your brain, you were also placed on steroids, you should continue to take these as prescribed.
Should you experience any fevers, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, severe headaches, new weakness, numbness, balance difficulties, double vision or any other symptom concerning to you, please call the health care provider at your facility for further assisstance or go to the emergency room.
