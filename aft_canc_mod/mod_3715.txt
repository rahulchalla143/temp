[**2132-6-6**] Biopsy: Left larynx, supraglottic mass, biopsy: Poorly differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma   Brief Hospital Course: 78-year-old woman with a laryngeal mass, diagnosed with poorly differentiated laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, stable with tracheostomy and G-tube placement.
Carcinoma: Biopsy of the laryngeal mass done [**6-6**] demonstrated poorly differentiated, invasive squamous cell carcinoma.
Intraop findings were notable for a bulky exophytic mass emanating from left aryepiglottic fold extending to medial wall of left piriform sinus and onto left true cord.
Pneumonia: There was concern that the patient may have had an aspiration event complicated by pneumonia following her tracheostomy procedure.
She was initially treated with five days of levofloxacin; this was broadened to pip/tazo on when she developed increased secretions.

She had aspiration during her swallowing evalulation as.

Echo showed normal EF (>55%), mild atrial dilation, moderate PA systolic hypertension.
Hypertension: Her lisinopril was stopped in favor of rate control with metoprolol (following episode of paroxysmal Afib).
These can be restarted at rehab as needed for edema or [**Month/Year (2) **] pressure control.
