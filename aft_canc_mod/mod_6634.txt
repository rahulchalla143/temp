Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 34601**] is a 58-yo woman s/p Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [**2177**] and Hx of [**Year (4 digits) **] NSAID use for back pain who presented [**2182-4-18**] w/ 4-day Hx of tarry stools, weakness, dizziness, and headaches  1.
Negative review for diarrhea and tenesmus, along with positive Hx of gastric bypass, gastritis/duodenitis on [**2176**] EGD, and Hx of prior GERD suggested likely upper GI source.
NGT aspirate showed no frank blood suggestive of brisk bleeding.
An EGD showed a gastro-jejunal anastomotic ulcer oozing blood, which was treated thermally.
She was transferred to the medical service with continued HCT and hemodynamic stability.
Pain management for [**Hospital1 **] pain was provided below.
The patient is also overdue for lower GI screening, as her last flex-sig was in [**2174**].
[**Year (4 digits) 8304**] Pain: The patient reports several types of pain: (a) [**Year (4 digits) **] back pain secondary to lumbar instability, s/p lumbar spine fusion in [**2162**], (b) [**Year (4 digits) **] oral pain s/p several dental implants over the last 10 years, and (c) "gas" pain s/p gastric bypass in [**2177**].
Home non-opioid medications (gabapentin, tizanidine) were restarted, with addition of scheduled acetaminophen.
Mental status remained preserved with this regimen, and the patient showed no clinical signs of opiate withdrawal.
Oral pain was insignificant during hospitalization, and PRN simethicone was suggested for bloating.
She was congratulated on managing her [**Hospital **] pain without significant opiate and NSAID use, with counseling to avoid NSAIDs completely and to attempt to wean opiates.
On transfer to medical floor, the patient showed stable HCT at 29-30, with SBP to high 150s without tachycardia.

Iron deficiency anemia The patient's baseline HCT is roughly 35.6, and Atrius records document Hx of iron-deficiency anemia.
The patient reports no iron supplementation for ~1 yr. Iron repletion was held during hospitalization due to potential confounding of BM inspection and Hx of [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] constipation linked to opiate use.
During hospitalization, zolpidem 5 mg qhs was used to avoid confounding of mental status evaluation, with good results.
Simethicone 80 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for Bloating.
)(s)* Refills:*1*  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Blood loss, anemia .
Secondary diagnoses: Gastric ulcer s/p Gastric bypass Hypertension [**Unit Number 8304**] back pain   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Ambulatory, independent, without dizziness.
You were started on a medicine (pantoprazole) for likely bleeding from your gastrointestinal tract.
You also had an endoscopic study, which showed an ulcer at the connection made between your stomach and small intestine during your gastric bypass surgery.
Your symptoms improved, and you were transferred from the intensive care unit onto a general medical floor.
Your symptoms continued to improve, and your blood tests and clinical condition suggested no further clinically significant bleeding.
Because of your stomach ulcer and recent gastrointestinal bleeding, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU AVOID TAKING MEDICINES CONTAINING aspirin (including Alka-Seltzer) and NSAIDS (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), naproxen (Aleve)).
During your hospitalization, you were able to significantly decrease the amount of opiate pain medicines used for your back.
Please talk to your primary doctor and pain management doctors about your [**Name5 (PTitle) **] back pain and mouth pain.
You are also overdue for colon cancer screening and evaluation of your lower gastrointestinal tract.
