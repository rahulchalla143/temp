Mild pericardial tamponade status post balloon pericardiotomy.
PRE PROCEDURE ECHO [**2153-10-24**] There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**10-5**]/201, the pericardial effusion has increased in size.
There is a small pericardial effusio similar to prior effusion seen after the pericardiocentesis [**2153-10-24**] which appears loculated and not circumferential.
No diastolic collapse of RA as seen on echocardiogram prior to the pericardiocentesis on [**2153-10-24**].
ECHO [**2153-10-26**] There is no pericardial effusion.
