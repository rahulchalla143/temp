No evidence of hydronephrosis.
There is perihilar haziness, upper zone vascular redistribution, and vascular indistinctness, findings all consistent with mild congestive heart failure, which is improved since the prior examination.
There is persistent retrocardiac opacity present, which may represent a collapsed/consolidation.
Additionally, there is a small bilateral pleural effusions, which appears slightly improved since the prior examination.
Degenerative changes are noted within the thoracic spine.
Mild congestive heart failure, improved since the prior examination.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, decreased since the prior examination.
Head CT [**2171-3-14**]: IMPRESSION:  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
Of note, an MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is most sensitive for acute infarction.

There is persistence of the nonspecific [**Doctor First Name 9189**] mesentery, without associated lymphadenopathy or bowel abnormalities.
There is no evidence of abscess or ascites.
There is no CT evidence of pancreatitis.

Renal failure was likely multifactorial related to his poor cardiac function, prerenal azotemia leading to ATN, and complicated by ACE inbitor and lasix use, obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy as he was noted to have urine residuals of 350cc when catheter was inserted, and continued periods of hypotension.
Despite efforts to closely monitor his fluid status, to increase his blood pressure to SBP >120 to maintain renal perfusion, to relieve obstruction by placing a foley, and to treat his funguria aggressively, his creatinine continued to rise.
He developed subtle metabolic acidosis, K+ rose but not above the normal level, and he continued to make urine and maintain a euvolemic fluid balance.
There was no an indication for acute initiation of hemodialysis.
Funguria: the patient had a fever and a delirium.
The only source of infection identified was yeast in his urine, and it was felt this warrented treatment.
Conjestive heart failure:  With treatment for his renal failure the patient developed acute worsening of his conjestive heart failure.
He became hypoxic and was admitted to the CCU.
His renal failure continued to worsen on this regimen, and he became hypotensive with SBP 80-90.
He did not complain of shortness of breath.
He did have elevated JVP suggestive of fluid overload.
He was discharged on continued metoprolol, hydralazine, and statin, for secondary prevention of CHF exacerbation.
Fevers:  The patient presented initially with fevers, with concern for UTI and pneumonia.
Additionally he was treated with flagyl for c.diff infection.
He also ruled out for influenza by nasal aspirate.
Additionally, there was concern for osteomyelitis given his chronic left heal ulcer.
X-ray; however, did not show any signs of osteomyelitis.
5.  h/o DVT:  pt had a DVT diagnosed in [**12-26**].
Anemia:  the patient has a history of anemia and guiaic positive stools.
He continued to have guiaic positive stools, but his Hct remained stable.
He should likely consider repeat colonoscopy as part of his outpatient.
Type II diabetes mellitus:  [**Last Name (un) **] services were consulted.
He should be encouraged to improve his po diet to sustain nutrition for healing of his pressure ulcers.

Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day): hold for loose stools.
