She also had pruritic lesions on the extensor surfaces of bilateral elbows, chest and scalp.
She was afebrile throughout the admission.
Derm believed that her rash was nonspecific but could be consistent with induced lichenoid eruption vs dermatitis herpetiformis vs non-specific eczema but w/u did no reveal any particular diagnosis.
She presented again to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**10-22**] with persistent cough, SOB, N/V, chills, low grade fever, fatigue and joint pain preventing her from ambulation.
She was found to be in severe acute renal failure and admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] Hospitalist service.
On [**10-25**] patient had increasing N/V and somnolence with asterixis, was started on HD for suspected uremia, with improving mentation after HD.
Pulmonary was consulted for persistent pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia.
Initially she was felt to be volume overloaded but HD did not clear her infiltrates and she was felt to be dry not wet.

No focal or textural abnormality of the liver.
No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.
The differential diagnosis includes HIV nephropathy as well as other medical renal diseases.
Enlarged fibroid uterus.
Small distal esophageal diverticulum.
No evidence of acute intra-abdominal pathology.
Mild fluid overload.
Possible right lung nodule incompletely evaluated.
Slight improvement in diffuse peribronchovascular patchy and nodular opacities, which may again be due to vasculitic or infectious process.
Peripheral reticular opacities, with basilar predominance and with some architectural distortion, suggestive of a UIP pattern.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2111-10-22**], no major change.
Pt was admitted to MICU with severe acute renal failure in setting of mild hypoxia.
Pt's serologies sent out for extensive rheum/renal w/u - pt's sx started to improve with treatment.
A renal biopsy was done on left kidney [**10-22**] and eventually showed collapsing FSGS.
She also has b/l pulmonary infiltrates of unclear etiology, and along with polyarthritis, new onset renal failure, mild transaminitits, initial concern was vasculitis.
However, renal biopsy did not show vasculitis and [**Doctor First Name **]/ANCA negative.
They felt the infiltrates were likely secondrary to fluid overload from renal failure.
However, after two weeks of dialysis and steroids, repeat CT [**11-8**] did now show much difference from [**10-22**] other than decreased pleural effusions.
She did not have any orthopnea, echo showed small LV/RV, she became tachycardic with standing (100-150s), and she had NO peripheral edema.
This suggested volume depletion.
Also, she was having intermittent fevers to 102 and intermittent O2 requirements.
As for her ARF, acute nephrotic syndrome, progressive renal failure, and renal biopsy c/w collapsing FSGS, the etiology was not clear.
Ms. [**Known lastname 35443**] history begins approximately 2 months ago with development of a macular rash on her chest that she thought was acne.
It was not pruritic or painful.
Then she developed arthralgias and morning stiffness.
She was seen by PCP in clinic on [**9-23**] c/o worsening arthritis/arthralgias symptoms, chest pain and non-productive cough.
In PCP's office she was noticed to have darkening of palmar surface of hands bilaterally with scattered 2-4 mm areas of macular hyperpigmentation on the distal aspects of fingers bilaterally which was suspected to be [**2-7**] Parvovirus infection.
A CXR revealed RML infiltrate c/w PNA and the Pt was Rx with Azithromycin on [**10-6**].
She was admitted briefly from [**Date range (1) 97758**] for PNA and polyarthritis, as outlined in HPI.
Her course has also been notable for tachycardia and persistent hypoxia with pulmonary infiltrates.
Her non-productive cough, DOE, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/opacities have persisted  despite dialysis with fluid removal.
Anti-smooth muscle antibody is positive.
A workup for elevated PTT has been non-specific with ongoing mild elevations in PTT with normal PT.
There was also concern for breast cancer recurrence based on CT findings for her pulmonary work up, but diagnostic mammography was negative for Ca.
The initial bronch report noted 2 white plaques in her trachea and bronchial systems with erythematous bases.
The pt reports ongoing dry cough and SOB.
Her cough improved with hydrated mask as compared to 6L NS dry O2.
The definitive diagnosis of her multi-organ system dysfunction has remained ellusive, but each problem was addressed as follows: .
# ARF/collapsing FSGS: Biopsy on [**2111-10-22**] showed collasping FSGS, and pulse steroids were started in addition to HD.
# Pulmonary opacities/Cough/hypoxia: Bilateral brochovascular opacities, also reticular peripheral/basilar opacities, and mild mediastinal LAD likely reactive.
Imaging was suggestive of vasculitis but [**Doctor First Name **]/ANCA negative as noted above.
ILD vs sarcoidosis were also considered, and she underwent VATS with biopsy.
Bx preliminarily showed dysplasia v. chronic inflammation but no granulomas.
Pulmonary embolism was considered, but UE/LE dopplers were negative, and echocardiogram showed small but normal RV, no pulmonary HTN.
We were unable to obtain CTA or V/Q scan due to her poor renal function and abnormal CXR, respectively.
Bronch and BAL findings as noted above, started on fluconazole with a plan to continue for 14 days (last dose [**2111-12-2**]).
# Anxiety/adjustment disorder: Pt was evaluated by Psychiatry and is thought to be at high risk for depression.
Pt particularly anxious at HD.
# Elevated PTT: Only very mildly elevated off heparin with normal PT, unclear clinical significance.
Restarted heparin SQ given very high risk of DVT/PE in this Pt who was essentially bed-bound with nephrotic syndrome.
CT [**11-3**] with fibroid uterus, and patient had been menstrating during the same period.
MRA done and showed patent mesenteric vessels.
# Abnormal breast opacity: H/o L breast DCIS s/p lumpectomy '[**09**], then partial masectomy.
CT on [**2111-10-29**] showed L breast spiculated nodule and R breast opacity.
Diagnostic mammogram on [**2111-11-10**] was negative for malignancy.

A biopsy of your kidney showed collapsing focal segmental glomerular sclerosis.
The bronchoscopy showed evidence of a fungal infection, which we are treating.
