HPI (per floor/MICU notes, confirmed w/pt): Briefly, 26 y/o F, flew from [**Country **] [**1-7**] for medical care, who presents with severe hip pain, low back pain and 4 weeks of urinary incontinence and fevers since [**2172**], although increasing in frequency over the past few weeks.
Also with occasional night sweats, denies weight changes or change in appetite, +intermittent nausea.
Recent progression of urinary incontinence, also associated with sensation changes in RLE.
In ED, performed pan-spine MRI, which demonstrated collapse of the superior and inferior endplates at L3, along with mild enhancing epidural soft tissue changes posterior to the vertebral body.
In the right sacrum, there was a large area of signal abnormality with adjacent soft tissue mass from S1 to S3 level, extending to the right iliacus muscle and ilium.
There also appeared to a thrombus in the IVC.
CXR also suggested bilateral lower lobe pulmonary nodules.
She was also found to have elevated LFTs, with ALT 48, AST 57, Alk phos 548, GGT 248, tbili 0.8.

Pan-spine MRI: CERVICAL SPINE: IMPRESSION: No significant abnormalities on MRI of the cervical spine.
THORACIC SPINE: IMPRESSION: No significant abnormalities on MRI of the thoracic spine.
No evidence of disc herniation, bony metastasis or epidural abscess.
1.2-cm nodular opacity in the right lower lung.
LUMBAR SPINE: IMPRESSION: The signal changes and associated soft tissue extension at L3 level and within the sacrum are suggestive of metastatic disease.
The central post-gadolinium low signal seen within the sacral mass appears to be due to central necrosis within a tumor than an area of abscess.
Probable thrombus within the inferior vena cava.
Massive aggressive tumor involving the entire left and mid scarum, right iliac bone, L3 and symphysis pubis which most likely represent metastatic spread.
Marked involvement of the liver by large masses most likely due to metastatic spread of unknown primary.
Multiple pulmonary metastases.
Bilateral massive central pulmonary embolism as described above, involving right main, right ascending and descending, left descending and their branches.
Multiple pulmonary nodules in lower lobes, representing metastasis as seen on the prior study.
Partially visualized heterogeneous masses in the liver representing metastasis as seen on the prior CT scan.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with preserved systolic function.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no evidence of DVT.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
Focal inferior vena caval thrombus at the L2 level.
Multiple masses consistent with the patient's history of metastatic disease.
There is no definite evidence of intracranial metastatic disease.
Prominent pituitary gland with possible microadenoma.
Heterogeneous bone marrow signal within the partially imaged cervical spine.
This finding may be related to underlying anemia versus an infiltrative process.
No interval change in appearance of innumerable soft tissue and bony metastatic lesions from prior exam dated [**2175-1-8**].
New left lung base wedge-shaped opacity most consistent with infarction given the prior history of a left lower lobe pulmonary embolism.
A/P:  26 y/o F, from [**Country 3587**], with h/o ovarian cyst/mass 6 years ago presenting with hip and back pain, decreased ability to ambulate and urinary incontince, found to have widely metastatic disease of unclear primary and bilateral PEs with residual IVC thrombus, s/p IVC filter placement [**1-10**].
# Initial hospital course: On the floor, Ms. [**Known lastname 13983**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a torso CT, which confirmed the presence of soft-tissue density masses, the largest in the left lingula, measuring 7.2cm x 6.5cm.
There was also local septal thickening in the subpleural posterior portion of the left lower lobe which could represent focal lymphangitic spread.
There was a 1.2cm hypoechoic nodule in the thyroid.
There was no mediastinal, axillary, or hilar adenopathy, and no bony lesions in the chest.
Abdominal cuts demonstrated multiple large heterogeneous masses involving the entire left hepatic lobe up to 6.5 cm in the most distal portion of the lobe and 6 x 7 cm in the more medial and lower portions with marked enlargement of the entire left lobe, depressing the transverse colon and stomach downward and backward.
There was retroperitoneal LAD up to 3 x 1.8 cm.
There was no evidence of bowel obstruction, and kidneys, adrenals, and pancreas were unremarkable.
Pelvis cuts demonstrated a L 7cm x 6.5cm ovarian lesion consistent with a dermoid cyst.
Images also confirmed the presence of a 9.5 x 7 x 10 cm heterogeneous mass involving the right and mid portion of the sacrum, the proximal portion of the iliac bone with complete destruction of the above-mentioned bones and invading the spinal canal at the level of the sacrum as well as the spinal nerve foramina.
In addition, there was partial destruction of the vertebral body of L3 with soft tissue mass entering into the spinal canal with mild compression.
There was a lytic lesion of the right part of the symphysis pubis with erosion of the cortex, periosteal reaction and soft tissue component.
The morning of admission, Ms. [**Known lastname 13983**] became tachycardic, with ECG showing evidence of right heart strain.
A stat chest CTA was obtained, which demonstrated massive bilateral central pulmonary embolism.
There was a large clot in the right main pulmonary artery, proximally occluding at least 50% of the lumen, distally completely occluding the lumen extending to right ascending and descending arteries, which continues down to the right middle and lower lobe branches.
There was also a total occluding clot in the left descending artery and its branches.
She was started on heparin drip, and a stat TTE was obtained, which demonstrated intact RV systolic function, with moderately elevated PA pressures, and no evidence of clot-in-transit.
LENIs showed no evidence of clot.
On [**1-10**], she went to IR and had an infrarenal IVC filter placed, and also had a biopsy of her sacral lesion by IR.
She was transferred back to the floor for further management after she was monitored and treated for PE in the MICU.
# Sacral mass w/widely metastatic disease: Concerning for neoplastic disease.
Pathology obtained from the sacral lesion showed only necrotic material.
The patient then had an IR-guided biopsy of a lesion lesion.
The pathology from the liver core showed poorly differentiated cells.
The differential included primary ovarian (hx of ovarian "cyst" removed 6 years ago and dermoid noted in left ovary on CT scan) vs yolk sac (given elevated AFP) vs lymphoma vs hepatoma (has active hep B) vs osteosarcoma vs breast.
A breast exam was performed and the patient was found to have fibrocystic breasts but no fixed masses or lumps, and no discharge from either breast.
The patient was seen by neurosurgery who felt the sacral lesion was inoperable.
There was concern for cord compression but the patient's neuro exam was carefully monitored and remained stable (patient continued to have urinary incontinence and unchanged slight lower extremity weakness ([**5-20**] LLE but normal strength 4/5 RLE)).
Heme/onc also followed the patient and recommended starting steroids for concern of cord compression.
Her pain remained under adequate control with PRN oxycodone.
There was no evidence of RV collapse on TTE.
#Hepatitis B: The patient was found to have labs consistent with chronic hepatitis B.
Her LFTs showed a mildly elevated AST (45), elevated GGT, and elevated AP (400) c/w metastatic bone and liver dx.
Bilirubin was normal and the patient showed no evidence of acute cholestasis during this admission.
# Elevated platelet count: Patient was admitted with extreme thrombocytosis given prior values >1000.
# ?UTI: Patient was found to have a mildly positive UA, and urine cx with Burkholderia cepacia.
# Low HCT: There are no prior Hct for a baseline Hct.
Primary: 1) Widely metastatic disease (sacral mass, pulmonary nodules, masses in liver) 2) pulmonary emboli - severe 3) dermoid cyst in left ovary 4) microcytic anemia 5) thrombocytosis 6) pseudomonal UTI .
Secondary: 1) Chronic HBV infection .
- Dexamethasone for possible cord compression from the tumor in your sacrum - Oxycodone as needed for back pain.
