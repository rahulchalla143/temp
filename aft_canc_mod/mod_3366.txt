<br><br><B>PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:</B> ======================== - [**2147**]: diagnosed with left renal cell carcinoma and underwent nephrectomy.
- [**1-/2159**]: PET-CT showed multiple foci of uptake in right lung, and subcarinal adenopathy and right liver lesion.
CT showed a 4.4 x 2.7cm right lower lobe lesion and right hilar lymphadenopathy and 7.6cm low density liver lesion.
FNA of the lung mass positive for NSCLC.
Bone scan showed abnormality in T10.
MRI brain showed an enlarged pituitary consistent with macroadenoma, but metastasis could not be ruled out.
- Treated to Dubai with alternative therapies until [**Month (only) 1096**] [**2159**] - [**Date range (2) 74388**]: Back at [**Hospital1 **] with CTA revealing marked progression of disease and new right adrenal metastasis.
- He has completed XRT to lung mass followed by two cycles of [**Doctor Last Name **]/Taxol chemosensitization.
Past Medical History: Metastatic NSCLC, as below h/o RCC s/p nephrectomy in [**Country 9819**] [**2147**] h/o abdominal ventral hernia SIADH  Social History: The patient immigrated to the United States in [**2151**] as a refugee from [**Country 16160**].

There is no pneumothorax or evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process, with multiple lung nodules/masses partially visualized and better evaluated on previous CT. Heart size is normal.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumothorax or new infiltrate.
<br> [**2160-4-18**] LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis of the right or left lower extremity.
No evidence of major vascular territorial infarct, although MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging remains more sensitive for this indication.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 66 yo male with metastatic NSCLC who presents following a witnessed syncopal event now anemic .
Syncope: Patient with likely vasovagal and/or hypovolemic syncope.
Patient without prior cardiac risk factors aside from age and enzymes/EKG are negative.
CT head negative for metastatsis.
Patient had this event in the setting of a bowel movement, which would suggest vasovagal activity.
Both hypovolemia and vasovagal likely contributed.
Tamponade was also suspected because pt had pulsus alternans and a pulsus of 15 as well as distant heart sounds.
A stat bedside echo showed no effusion.
Febrile neutropenia: Fever of unclear etiology and no suspected source.
He was afebrile for over 48 hours and ANC improved, so he was taken off antibiotics.
