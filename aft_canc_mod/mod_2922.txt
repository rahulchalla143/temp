Treatment was delayed a few days secondary to elevated bili, but started on [**2-6**].
He returned to clinic today for follow up and was found to have fever to 100.6 and ANC of 60.
His course was complicated by arachnoiditis and spinal headache after intrathecal methotrexate and he developed a large saddle pulmonary embolus potentially related to his L-asparaginase.
He also developed pulmonary infarct with bloody pleural effusion and has had several episodes of febrile neutropenia.
He was treated with heparin for the pulmonary embolus and an IVC filter was placed.
He had a trial of fondaparinux but had an allergic reaction.
In light of having a filter in place and cyclic thrombocytopenia while on treatment, he has not had further anticoagulation.
He has received the remainder of his protocol treatment with L-asparaginase omitted due to the pulmonary embolism.
He completed his intensification with high-dose methotrexate and underwent stem cell mobilization in the summer of [**2197**] and then completed his radiation therapy in early [**Month (only) **] and underwent consolidation with intrathecal ARA-C.
He began cycle 1 of consolidation on [**2198-9-10**].
He began cycle 2 of consolidation on [**2198-10-8**], where he received 5 days of cytarabine and etoposide last given on [**2198-10-12**].
Shortly before [**2198-10-22**], he began to experience an ascending weakness.
He was admitted to the neurology service where nerve conduction studies revealed a Guillain-[**Location (un) **] like syndrome as well as a polyneuropathy presumed to be from diabetes mellitus and vincristine.
He completed cycles 3 and 4 without further complication.
Complicated by transaminitis requiring dose reduction of 6MP and then a change to thioguannine and chemotherapy break in [**10-30**].
