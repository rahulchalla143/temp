Occasional erythroid precursor with irregular nuclear contours and asymmetrical nuclear budding is seen.
Megakaryocytes are present in normal numbers; loosely clustered and abnormal forms are seen including some hypolobated forms.
[**2101-4-22**] TTE: Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Lungs demonstrate some atelectasis at the right base.
There is no focal consolidation or pneumothoraces.

[**2101-4-27**] LENI's: No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.
There is no CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion.
No pneumothorax is detected.
No pneumothorax detected.
Subtle changes described in the report of a [**2101-4-26**] CT scan are not appreciated on today's radiograph, question due to interval resolution versus limitations of radiographs versus CT.  [**2101-5-6**] BM cytogenetics: KARYOTYPE: 47,XY,+15,[**Doctor First Name 15**](15)(Q15Q24)[5]/46,XY[11] INTERPRETATION: Five of 16 metaphases contained an additional copy of chromosome 15 (TRISOMY 15) and an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 15.
[**2101-5-6**] BM biopsy: BONE MARROW WITH FINDINGS CONSISTENT WITH CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC  MYELOABLATION.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES OF INVOLVEMENT BY ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA ARE NOT SEEN.
Erythrocytes appear decreased in number and exhibit mild anisopoikilocytosis..  Rare dacrocytes and red cell fragments seen.
Rare large granular lymphocytes seen on scan.
It consists of few cellular spicules.
The majority of the cellularity is comprised of stromal cells, lymphocytes and reactive plasma cells.
Erythroid elements and megakaryocytes are nearly absent.
[**2101-5-7**] CT chest: No acute intrathoracic process.
[**2101-5-8**] CT sinus: Mild bilateral maxillary sinus mucosal thickening but no bone destruction or remodeling.
Decreased attenuation in the peripheral zone of the prostate in the appropriate clinical setting could reflect prostatitis.
The well circumscribed hypodensity is likely a prostatic cyst, but an abscess cannot be excluded.
Linear opacity in the proximal appendix could reflect an intraluminal foreign body such as a bone, the distal appendix is not distended and there is no associated inflammatory change.
There are, however, two large lymph nodes in the ileocolic region of uncertain significance.
Brief Hospital Course: 35 year old male with no past medical history with multiple month history of malaise and shortness of breath, presents with laboratory studies suggestive of acute leukemia, found to have AML.
He completed 7+3 with...  # Acute leukemia: Aggressive presentation found to be monocytic leukemia as expected given signs of gingival hyperplasia.
Patient also presented with acute kidney injury and elevated uric acid.
Leukopheresis was not performed given no signs of leukostasis.
Electrolytes, CBC, fibrinogen, uric acid, and LDH were checked initially every four hours, but then every six hours to evaluate for both tumor lysis and DIC.
He had persistent daily febrile neutropenia.
There is a question of prostatis on imaging but without any clinical symptoms and with all urine cultures incl chlamydia being negative, but regardless was started on meropenem.
There is also a question of a bone in his appendix, but upon review with rads, this could be an appendicolith which may cause appendicitis when his white count recovers.
He noted new pain at angle of the left jaw.
CT neck ordered to evaluate and negative for mastoiditis.
ENT was curbsided and wo evidence of mastoiditis pt was not candidate for surgical intervention or drainage.
He was treated with Afrin x 3 days with resolution of the pain attributed to congestion and otitis.
Repeat bone marrow biopsy done on day 14 revealed persistent cytogenetic abnormalities.
Bone marrow biopsy done on day 20 revealed no leukemic cells and pt was discussed at transplant meeting w decision to postpone additional chemo or SCT at this time w plans for observation.
# Thrombocytosis: Uptrend observed and splenomegaly appreciated on exam [**5-21**] w pt c/o mild abd discomfort w sitting.
CT abd showed no acute process.
# Acute kidney injury: Likely secondary to leukemic infiltration and excess lysozyme release.
Renal ultrasound was perfomed and showed enlarged kidney.
Patient was started on allopurinol and was given one dose of rasburicase prior to chemotherapy administration to for tumor lysis prophylaxis.
# DIC: Patient presented with signs of DIC on admission, with elevated PT, PTT, INR and fibrinogen.
Active type and screen was maintained.
# Normocytic anemia: MCV was 96 on admission, likely in setting of excess blast cells.
# Dyspnea on exertion: Patient presented with dyspnea, likely related to anemia and acute leukemia.
There was no history of lung disease, and symptom was not associated with chest pain or palpitations.
A baseline chest X-ray was obtained and showed no abnormality.
Nebulizers were given PRN for symptoms of dyspnea during admission.
# Lightheadedness/syncope: Patient sustained numerous falls before admission, likely related to anemia and volume depletion.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed before chemotherapy administration which showed no gross abnormalities of heart function.
ECG showed no abnormalities.
# Otitis: no evidence of mastoiditis on CT. ENT curbsided and recommended treatment with afrin.
Pt had resolution of jaw pain, pt had continued congestion and "muffled hearing" that will likely resolve slowly in next few weeks.
Disp:*5 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Acute myelogenous leukemia  Secondary Diagnosis: Prostatitis  Tertiary Diagnosis: Otitis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted with dehydration and recurrent falls, found to have acute myelogenous leukemia.
You had persistent fevers during the course of your neutropenia was likely a cause of prostatitis and treated with antibiotics.
Repeat bone marrow biopsy done on day 14 showed a persistence of abnormal cells.
Bone marrow biopsy done on day 20 revealed lack of leukemia and we plan to observe you for now without additional chemotherapy at this time.
You had jaw pain and muffled hearing consistent with otitis media.
