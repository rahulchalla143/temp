Admission Date:  [**2159-9-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2159-9-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2090-11-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**] Chief Complaint: Hypercarbic respiratory failure.
History of Present Illness: This is a 68 M with lung cancer, status post trach with vent dependence, recent post obstructive pneumonia on broad spectrum antibiotics, prior pulmonary embolus, COPD, hypertension and diabetes.
He presented from a rehabilitation facility to the ED, with increased respiratory distress and new opacities seen on chest x-ray.
He had recently been discharged from the ICU of an OSH for dyspnea and lethargy.
There he had been diagnosed with the pneumonia and started on a 14 day course of vancomcyin/cefepime/flagyl (last day [**9-11**]),  At 11 am yesterday he was noted to be increasingly tachypneic, a chest x-ray reveal "white out" in the L lung field (per facility report).
He was afebrile but tachypneic, hypertensive and tachycardic.
Chest X-ray revealed L perihilar lung mass and opacities in the L lower lobe.
CTA confirmed presence of these findings and, in addition, was negative for pulmonary embolus.
After the CTA the patient's mental status began to decline and he became increasingly difficult to ventilate.
He became poorly responsive and a blood gas returned as 7.02/144/402/40.
It was believed that there were air leaks around his trach and there also was possibly some obstruction.
Also of note he was given labetalol for control of his hypertension and tachycardia.
A bronchoscopy was urgently performed and revealed an obstruction in the trach.
Past Medical History: 1) Lung adenocarcinoma 2) Tracheostomy, chronically ventilator dependent 3) Post obstructive pneumonia 4) History of VRE and MRSA infection 5) S/p G-tube placement 4) History of pulmonary embolism, not on anticoagulation 5) History of retroperitoneal bleed 6) COPD 7) Hypertension 8) Diabetes type II.

The patient was intubated and placed on assist control mechanical ventilation with respiratory and mental status returning to baseline as a result.
He underwent repeat bronchoscopy which revealed near complete occlusion of the trach tube.
The patient did complain of dyspnea intermittently and there was some concern that he had an air leak around his tracheostomy tube.
For the air leak the tracheostomy tube was replaced with a larger tube.
1) Respiratory failure.
Speech and Swallow was consulted for Passy-Muir placement but were unable to see the patient due to his recent trach change.
Likely lobar pneumonia rather than post-obstructive (as indicated in notes from OSH) given absence of obstruction noted on bronchoscopy.
OSH had recommended this duration given patient's history of MRSA and VRE.
4) History of pulmonary embolus.
No evidence of PE on CTA.
Patient has IVC filter in place and history of retroperitoneal bleed and is therefore not anticoagulated.
5) Hypertension/Grade I CHF with Diastolic Dysfunction.
Although likely secondary to chronic disease, please follow-up iron studies.
No record of medications for glycemic control.
7) History of ureteral tear.
Mild hematuria on urinalysis.
8) Non SCLC stage IIIb.
According prior records, this has been deemed unresectable and patient is on no treatments at this time.
Please consider reopening discussion of lung cancer treatment with his family.
FEN: Patient had episode of clogged G-tube refractory to flushing efforts, but an abdominal x-ray with gastrografin contrast through G-tube showed contrast in stomach.
Secondary non small cell lung cancer pneumonia hypertension diabetes mellitus type II   Discharge Condition: Good, respiratory status now returned to baseline.
Otherwise, afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
Discharge Instructions: Please return patient to emergency department for any sign of respiratory failure including: hypoxemia unresponsive to adjustments in ventilation declining mental status  also seek emergent medical intervention for any signs or symptoms of sepsis  Followup Instructions: Patient to extended care facility.
