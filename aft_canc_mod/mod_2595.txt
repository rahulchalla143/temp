Patient was well until 3-4 weeks ago when he noticed exertional dyspnea when climbing a flight of stairs or out shopping.
He denies any symptoms of chest pain/pressure or SOB at rest.
Past Medical History: Coronary Artery Disease Mitral Regurgitation Heart Failure (systolic) Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation Renal Insufficiency Peripheral Vascular disease Hypertension Chronic Anemia AAA s/p Endovascular stent [**2129**] Myocardial Infarction [**2109**] Gout Osteoathritis Venous ligation GI bleeding   Social History: retired, worked in plastics factory, Married lives with spouse [**Name (NI) 1139**] - quit 25 years ago, 80 pack year history Denies ETOH  Family History: Brother and mother deceased from [**Last Name **] problem  Physical Exam: Blood pressure was 170/100 mm Hg while seated.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
neck was supple with JVP of 11 cm with postive hepatojugular reflex The carotid waveform was normal.
There was no thyromegaly.
The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
The patient has a prominent venous pattern in his subcutaneous tissues.
The lungs had soft end expiratory crackles bilaterally at both bases.
There were no thrills, lifts or palpable S3 or S4.
There were no rubs, murmurs, clicks or gallops.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness.
The abdomen was obese, soft nontender and nondistended.
The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
There were no abdominal, femoral or carotid bruits.
no evidence of stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Rectal Exam: Smooth symmetrically enlarged prostate with brown stool in rectal vault.
N:65.7 L:24.7 M:5.0 E:2.5 Bas:2.0 PT: 12.6 PTT: 26.4 INR: 1.1  [**2133-1-30**] Echocardiogram:  EF 35-40%, the left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed with thinned and akinetic inferior/inferolateral.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Subpleural areas of reticular opacity with associated traction bronchiectasis, corresponding to the abnormalities seen on the recent chest radiograph.
Findings likely reflect sequela of prior infectious etiology or chronic aspiration.
Panacinar emphysema with upper lobe predominance.
Extensive coronary artery calcifications.
[**2133-2-3**] Bladder U/S: Arising from the left posterior bladder wall, there is a 1.7 x 1.2 x 2.1 cm soft tissue lesion.
The lesion is solid, therefore this would not be consistent with an ureterocele and more concerning for a bladder mass or benign solid lesion.
No other bladder abnormalities are detected.
1.7 x 1.2 x 2.1 soft tissue lesion arising from the left posterior bladder wall adjacent to the orifice of the left ureter.
Given slight interval growth compared to CT of [**Month (only) 216**] [**2129**] and solid appearance this may represent a benign or malignant solid lesion and further workup with cystoscopy is recommended.
Elevated filling pressures.
Depresed cardiac index.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Moderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: Presented for evaluation of chest pain, started on heparin for atrial fibrillation and underwent cardiac catheterization [**2133-1-30**] which revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.
While on heparin he developed both hematuria and bright red blood per rectum.
A bladder ultrasound revealed a mass and urology was consulted.
Bladder irrigation was started and he was cleared by urology for cardiac surgery.
He went to the operating room on [**2133-2-3**] where coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels was performed as well as a mitral valve repair using a 26mm [**Company **] band.
He required bladder irrigation for hematuria in the OR which was continued in the unit.
Bladder irrigation was stopped and he remained without hematuria.
On POD #2 he had atrial fibrillation which was treated with beta blockers and amiodarone.
The renal service was consulted for an elevated creatinine which slowly trended back towards normal.
He will follow-up with the urology service for further management of his bladder mass.
His coumadin will be managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 24717**] for an INR of 2.0-2.5 for atrial fibrillation.
The vascular surgery service will follow-up with him in a couple of weeks for a revision of his infrarenal aortic stent.
Warfarin 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: Does for goal INR of 2.0-2.5 for atrial fibrillation.
Atrovent HFA 17 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation four times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
