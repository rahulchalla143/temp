Blood Cultures x 4 no growth to date  Pathology: Procedure date     Tissue received [**2129-6-23**] [**2129-6-23**] [**2129-6-28**] DIAGNOSIS: Left Parietal pleura, biopsy: Negative for malignant cells.
There is no residual pneumothorax.
Loculated left pleural effusion is unchanged.
Bibasilar opacity, probably due to atelectasis are unchanged.
[**2129-6-24**] Chest X-Ray IMPRESSION: Interval reaccumulation of moderate-sized pleural effusion on the left with loculated air at the apex.
Worsening airspace consolidation indicative of worsening pneumonia or possible hemorrhage.
Multifocal increased airspace opacity in both left lower lobe and right middle lobe.
Decreased intraperitoneal free air as compared to CT from [**2129-6-30**].
Mild gallbladder pericholecystic fluid and wall edema with intraluminal sludge.
Reactive lymphadenopathy and pulmonary nodules and lateral chest wall inflammatory changes, recommend followup CT once acute process has resolved to evaluate for interval course.
Marked decrease in left pleural effusion following decortication and placement of two left chest tubes, with residual moderate partially loculated effusion.
High attenuation lenticular pleural collections in the lower left hemithorax are suggestive of hemorrhagic fluid.
Small left apical hydropneumothorax and marked pneumoperitoneum.
Numerous small lung nodules, with long-term stability of right upper lobe nodules.
Right lower lobe nodules are new since [**2123**] and may be inflammatory, but attention to this area on followup CT in three months is recommended to exclude neoplastic nodules.
Widespread ground-glass attenuation and asymmetric septal thickening, possibly representing hydrostatic edema, but coexisting infection should be considered, particularly given asymmetrical areas of consolidation in the right upper lobe.
[**2129-7-5**] Echocardiogram: IMPRESSION: No vegetations visualized but image quality insufficient to exclude endocarditis given shadowing from aortic prosthesis and mitral annular calcification.
If clinically indicated, a TEE would better assess for prosthetic valve endocarditis.
Mild-moderate mitral stenosis due to mitral annular calcification.
No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 284**] was admitted on [**2129-6-23**] following medical pleuroscopy, during which 750 cc of serosanguineous fluid was drained.
There were no pleural abnormalities noted on thoracoscopic evaluation.
A postprocedure x-ray disclosed that the lung did not expand and placement of a left chest tube.
POD#2 She had low urine output and was bolused with IV fluids.
The chest x-ray showed a consolidation likely blood, therefore tPa was administered through the chest tube with a good response.
POD#5 Her chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and she was given iv lasix with a good response.
POD#6 CT chest without contrast revealed a marked decrease in left pleural effusion following the decortication and placement of two left chest tubes, with residual moderate partially loculated effusion.
Findings also included a small left apical hydropneumothorax and marked pneumoperitoneum along with expansion of the left lateral chest wall musculature with adjacent fluid.
Finally, numerous small lung nodules, with long-term stability of right upper lobe nodules, were observed but the right lower lobe nodules are new since [**2123**] and may be neoplastic.
IV heparin was begun at 1100 units and due to subtherapeutic PTTs, increased gradually to 1350 units.
The PICC line was removed and tip was cultured with no growth.
POD#9  An echocardiogram was performed and showed no aortic vegetation.
An abdominal ultrasound was done and revealed no acute cholecystitis.
POD#[**9-3**] Her temperature gradually resolved.
A repeat Chest CT showed possible pneumonia verses hemorrhage.
Follow-up chest x-ray revealed a loculated left pleural effusion.
