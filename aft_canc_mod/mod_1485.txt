PEG placement   History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old Russian-speaking female with a history of HTN, CRI, chronic nephrolithiasis, who presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure.
In the ED found to have a right mainstem intubation so her ETT was drawn back.
Large amount of thick sputum noted.
U/A revealed many bacteria, w/ >50 WBC's.
Hypertension 2.
Chronic renal insufficiency 3.
Type II diabetes mellitus 4.
Chronic low back pain 5.
Nephrolithiasis  Social History: 1.
No obvious perinephric abscess is seen.
There is no evidence of small bowel obstruction.
2) Right lower lobe opacity is most likely atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be excluded.
3) Small pericardial effusion.
4) Severe vascular calcifications.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with left PCA acute infarct on CT, unresponsive, intubated.
Has flaccid right arm, moves the right leg less than the left.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Left PCA stroke on CT. Unresponsive and intubated ____ right arm.
FINDINGS: There is abnormal diffusion in the inferior right cerebellar hemisphere as well as focally in the left cerebellar hemisphere.
There is also abnormal signal in the left medial occipital lobe and medial temporal lobe, all consistent with infarction.
In retrospect the right inferior cerebellar infarct was present on the CT scan of [**2167-5-24**].
There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage.
On the susceptibility sequences compared to the prior study of [**1-27**], there appears to be a new abnormal focus in the medial left thalamus perhaps reflecting the intercurrent petechial hemorrhage in this location.
There is no evidence of a focal extra-axial lesion or fluid collection.
There is confluent T2 high signal intensity signal in the periventricular white matter and centrum semiovale, which is nonspecific but could reflect microvascular angiopathy.
There is a cystic lesion deep to the left rectus capitis muscle which was not present on the prior MR study of [**2163-2-3**].
This may be an unusual location of a Tornwaldt cyst or possibly an inclusion cysts.
No specific evidence to suggest that this represents retroperitoneal abscess.
IMPRESSION: Subacute infarcts involving the left cerebral hemisphere and the cerebellum as described.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of aneurysm or flow abnormality.
The left posterior cerebral artery has diminished signal and to be occluded or stenotic.
IMPRESSION: Reduced signal left posterior cerebral artery see above discussion.

IMPRESSION: Reduced signal left posterior cerebral artery see above discussion.
Aneurysmal interatrial septum.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
Mild mitral annular calcification.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Based on [**2158**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The interatrial septum is markedly aneurysmal.
No atrial septal defect is identified on color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Aortic valve sclerosis.
Based on [**2158**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
A developing density at the left base is noted since [**2167-5-25**].
Widening of the superior mediastinum on the right side remains stable.
IMPRESSION: Developing density at the left base since [**2167-5-25**].
Brief Hospital Course: 1) CVA - The patient presented after being found unresponsive.
A CT head was performed and revealed an "acute / sub acute infarct in the left posterior cerebral artery distribution."
It was presumed that the patient may have suffered a new stroke leading to a aspiration pneumonia.
She remained intubated during her short ICU stay as she remained minimally responsive off sedation.
The neurologists noted a left-sided weakness on their exam and recommended a MRI/MRA scan to assess for the new stroke which was confirmed acute and embolic.
The MR revealed "subacute infarcts involving the left cerebral hemisphere and the cerebellum" and the MRA revealed "left posterior cerebral artery has diminished signal and to be occluded or stenotic."
Given multiple areas of infarction suspicion was for an embolic source.
A TTE was performed which revealed a aneurysm of thje right atrial septum.
This was presumed to be the source of the embolic strokes.
However, ongoing hematuria limited coumadin therapy.
However, hematuria continued nonetheless, requiring another unit of blood to be transfused.
The possibility of an increased risk of stroke with less anticoagulation was conveyed to the daughter and HCP.
2) Respiratory failure - She presented with hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation.
This was presumed to be due to aspiration pneumonia following the CVA.
On day 2 of admission, the patient underwent a bronchoscopy revealing pus in the right lower lobe area.
3) Altered mental status: The patient's mental status was attributed to a combination of infectious processes and medications, and multiple strokes.
Over her hospital course she showed slow improvement, eventually speaking a few words in Russian prior to discharge.
4) UTI - treated with Levoquin  5) Nutrition - Given her poor mental status following extubation, it was not safe to even attempt a speech and swallow evaluation.
If her mental status improves she should have an outpatient swallow evaluation prior to taking any POs.
6) Hematuria - Patient has a history of bladder polyps that have required cauterization.
Recently a large, fungating bladder mass was found at an OSH.
Patient had persistent hematuria in house requiring continuous bladder irrigation.
Urology was following and stated that the patient will always have hematuria and that prior attempts have been unsuccessful in reducing it.
They stated that hematuria could be tolerated as long as there were no large blood clots.
She continued to have bleeding, but no clots were observed and there was good UOP.
7) Abdominal pain - Following PEG placement, she complained intermittently of abdominal pain.
There were no tube feed residuals and amylase and lipase were normal.
8) Hyperglycemia - she had elevated blood sugars once tube feeds started.
Initially treated with ISS, but Lantus started due to persistent hyperglycemia.
9) Thrush - 7 day course of fluconazole  10) HTN - lopressor 50 [**Hospital1 **]  11) Code - DNR/DNI   Medications on Admission: 1.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: CVA PNA UTI Sepsis Hematuria Thrush Hyperglycemia   Discharge Condition: stable  Discharge Instructions: Please seek medical attention if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or other concerning symptoms.
