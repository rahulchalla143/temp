History of Present Illness: 72M with MDS, recently discharged from 12R for diffuse body pain without improvement or diagnosis, initially planned for direct admit back to 12R.
However, given slowed mental status, refusing speaking per family, evaluated in ED.

CT HEAD: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or large vascular territorial infarction.
Mild prominence of the ventricles and sulci is compatible with mild diffuse atrophy which is age-appropriate.
There is no acute fracture.
Included views of the mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses are clear.
There is moderate calcification of the cavernous segments of both internal carotid arteries, left greater than right.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
22 x 7 mm intramedullary mass within the cervical spinal cord from C2 to C3 which is hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging, with areas of lower signal intensity within the mid superior aspect.
There are multiple nodules within the lungs.
11 x 8 mm right parotid lesion, T2 hyperintense may represent a cystic mass or node, and less likely a pleomorphic adenoma.
Multilevel degenerative changes throughout the cervical and thoracic spine, with partial ankylosis of C3 to C5 with bulky anterior osteophytes.
No evidence of epidural abscess.
Additionally, there are multiple sternotomy sutures.
There is no paravertebral soft tissue swelling to suggest an ongoing inflammatory process.
CONCLUSION: Intramedullary mass within the upper cervical cord.
See above  report for differential diagnosis.
Degenerative changes of the cervical spine.
No evidence of intracranial mass or cerebral edema.
Moderate global atrophy.
Diffusely and uniformly T1-hypointense regional bone marrow signal, as on the recent MR examinations of the spine; this likely relates to the apparently known underlying myelodysplastic syndrome .
MRI Lumbar: Findings of concern for metastatic neoplastic disease involving the visualized lower thoracic and lumbar spine, with additional findings as noted above.
Bone Scan [**2175-4-13**]: IMPRESSION: Widespread foci of abnormal tracer activity throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton as described above.
Pattern most compatible with widespread osseous metastasis from an unknown primary.
No failure is present.
There is some loss of the right heart border suggesting infiltrate in right middle lobe.
IMPRESSION: Probable right middle lobe pneumonia.
In addition, a small left suprabasal opacity has occurred that could correspond to local atelectasis.
Otherwise, there is no relevant change.
Unchanged absence of pulmonary edema.
Unchanged absence of pleural effusions.
Old right-sided clavicular fracture.
PATHOLOGY PENDING AT TIME OF DISCHARGE   Brief Hospital Course: 72 yo M with MDS, chronic back pain of unknown source with recent neg eval, returns with back pain, fever, AMS.
# Fever: Patient admitted with fever and concurrent rise in WBC from 2s to 3.6 and diff changed from 3 30-40% neutrophils and no bands, to 61%N and 9%bands.
Given the back pain there was concern for epidural abcess.
MRI r/o abcess (no contrast given creatinine of 2.7), but showed metastatic disease to the spine.
Antibiotics were discontinued on [**4-10**] as no obvious source of fever was present.
Patient again spiked a fever to 101 after his bronchosopy, and was noted to be confused an mildly hypoxic to 91 on RA.
A CXR showed evidence of RLL infiltrate, so he was treated with 7 days of PO levofloxacin.
CT scan images from OSH were obtained and reviewed and nodules only seem to be amenable to open lung biopsy or CT-guided biopsy.
Repeat CT torso showed interval increase in the size of his lung nodules as well as interval increase in the size of a mediastinal lymph node.
Spinal masses: MRI with multiple masses throughout his spine suggestive of metastatic disease.
Oncology was consulted and suggested biopsy of the lowest risk spinal lesions.
Interventional neuro radiology felt that the spinal lesions were not necessarily metastasis and may be related to his MDS.
A CT torso was performed, which was less suggestive of spinal metastasis.
A bone scan was performed which suggested widespread bony metastatic disease.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr baseline 1.5, stage 3 admitted with Cr of 2.7 UA with SG 1.018, pos for protein and bacteria, no WBCs/leuks/epis.
No EKG changes.
# Intubation: Pt electively intubated for MRI given concern for epidural abcess.
He was kept intubated given concern for metastatic disease and further work up needed (MRI of head).
# Myelodysplastic Syndrome: On aranesp and neupogen.
Some concern that this pain is related to his neupogen, although his pain has not improved despite decreased dose of neupogen.
Given his worsening anemia and bony pain, there has been consideration of repeating a bone marrow biopsy.
# Angina/CAD s/p CABG - Aspirin was held given possible procedure.
# Aflutter: currently sinus.
# Hyperlipidemia - continued Zetia .
# Enlarged prostate - patient was continued on Tamsulosin.
On exam, prostate was enlarged, asymmetric, firm with irregular surface.
# Gout: Patient noted R metatarsal-phalangeal joint pain and swelling, consistent with prior joint flare.
# Type 2 Diabetes [**Date Range **] - Held glipizide and metformin given NPO and renal failure.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Malignancy with metastases, unknown primary Fever Back Pain Pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for back pain and fever.
Further imaging with CT and bone scan showed lung nodules, and lesions in your bones suspicious for cancer.
After the procedure you developed fevers, confusion and shortness of breath.
Also, your pain was controlled with long acting and short acting narcotics.
Please start Oxycodone 5-10 mg by mouth every 4-6 hours for BREAKTHROUGH pain.
This is your short acting pain medication.
