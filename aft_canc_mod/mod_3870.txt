Admission Date:  [**2173-11-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-12-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2144-1-16**]             Sex:   F  Service: OBSTETRICS/GYNECOLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 21007**] Chief Complaint: chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 29 yo female with history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid bleeding, presents with pleuritic chest pain for approximately one week.
She notes that she felt some left chest cramping last week; however, the pain did not become severe until [**2173-11-26**].
Pain initially radiated to back and now is going down to her left buttocks.
This is in background of ~2 months of dyspnea on exertion which has noticably worsened in last two weeks.
Also patient is reporting that she had sudden onset BLE edema that she first noticed after a plane trip to St. [**Doctor First Name **] (4 hour leg to [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 8880**] [**Country **] was longest time on plane).
She denies any LE edema at this time.
She notes that her last menstral period (and start of her abnormal uterine bleeding) was [**2173-9-27**].
Patient took a high dose OCP taper starting [**2173-10-22**] for large uterine fibroids that were causing significant uterine bleeding.
At time of admission she was taking one pill daily, though she had been instructed to start another high dose OCP taper due to increased vaginal bleeding in the last 4 to 5 days.
She had planned for an open myommectomy on [**2174-1-12**] due to persistent bleeding.
She explicitly denies any history of pregnancy, abortions, or miscarriages.
Presented with chest pain.
Was found to have elevated d-dimer to ~[**Numeric Identifier 7206**] and subsequently found to have extensive bilateral PE on CTA chest.
EKG was without wigns of right heart strain.
Was originally destined for the floor, though the floor attending was concerned about full anticoagulation in the setting of recent uterine bleeding.
Needs to be typed, crossed, and consented for blood products in the event of uterine bleeding while anticoagulated.
Tobacco: Rare EtOH: Occasional, less use since she has struggled with uterine bleeding Illicits: Denies   Family History: MGM, MGF, PGF: Diabetes PGF: Died from MI No history of blood clots, sudden death, autoimmune disorders.

There is a nodular subpleural opacity within the periphery of the right lower lobe (2, 40) which may represent a small pulmonary infarct.
Filling defects within the left upper lobe segmental arteries (2, 19), lingula (2, 24), and left lower lobe (2, 36) segmental arteries are also identified.
There is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a small left pleural effusion.
There is no evidence of bowing of the interventricular septum to suggest right heart failure at this time.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions identified.
IMPRESSION: Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli as described above.
Possible right lower lobe pulmonary infarct.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2173-11-29**] Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasound No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either lower extremity.
Brief Hospital Course: 29 yo female with history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid bleeding who presented with pleuritic chest pain for approximately one week and was diagnosed with pulmonary emboli.
#VB: She had increased bleeding in the 4 to 5 days leading up to presentation to the hospital.
She was started on Lupron to minimize uterine bleeding on [**11-28**].
Her bleeding worsened after being placed on a heparin gtt for PE, and in the setting of acute Lupron injection but and she was followed closely by the gynecology service while in the ICU.
the tachycardia was attributed to the pulmonary embolism.
#PE: She was continued on the Heparin gtt until HD#9 at which time, her vaginal  bleeding had decreased significantly.
# Fever/Pelvic Pain: Her hospital course was complicated by recurrent fever and pelvic pain.
The fevers and pain were attributed to degenerating fibroids in the setting of recent Lupron injections.
Several sets of blood cultures were drawn but showed no growth.
A urine analysis was initally negative but on HD11 the urine culture grew Gardnerella and she was started on flagyl 500 twice daily to be continued for 7 days.
An infectious disease consult was also obtained to help ensure that no occult infections were being missed given the recurrent fevers.
The ID consultants agreed that UTI was unlikely to be causing fevers, but that the most likely etiology was degenerating fibroid given pain and no change in fever curve with antibiotics.
They recommeded an MRV of the pelvis to rule out septic pelvic thrombophlebitis, repeat blood cultures, and a CT of the chest to rule out lung abscess.
The CT demonstrated no abscess.
A pelvic MRV/MRI did not demonstate septic pelvic thrombophlebitis but did show non-enhancing fibroids--consistent with the diagnosis of fibroid degeneration as an etiology for her fever.
The addition of ibuprofen helped to control her pain but did not relieve it.
# Dispo: On HD 13 She was discharged home in stable condition.
Her pain was well controlled and her vaginal bleeding was minimal to moderate.
The plan was for her to remain on Lupron for vaginal bleeding until which time she was no longer anticoagulated and then she will likely have a myomectomy.
