No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Stable pancreatic tail cystic lesion since [**2104-12-22**], though lesion has increased in size since [**2095**].
Large hiatal hernia.
[**2105-1-11**] Chest xray IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**8-2**] and [**2104-11-25**]:  Large hiatus hernia, filled with air and fluid occupies the midline.
Heart size is top normal, but there is greater mediastinal vascular engorgement reflecting mild volume overload.
Lung volumes are lower and making it difficult to distinguish between mild dependent edema and atelectasis, particularly on the left.
Small right pleural effusion is new.
No pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
Erythema and friability in the whole stomach compatible with gastritis Polyps in the stomach body Bile noted in duodenum.
Small lipoma visualized in 2nd portion of the duodenum.
No other ulcer or source of bleeding identified.
Do not initiate currently in the event of recurrent bleed and need for endoscopic intervention.
Stomach: Protruding Lesions Four mixed polyps of benign appearance with stigmata of recent bleeding and ranging in size from 10 mm to 20 mm were found in the stomach body.
Small ulcerations were seen on the surface of 2 of the larger polyps.
GI performed EGD which demonstrated no active bleeding, but did identify polyps as the likely source of his HCT drop.
History of DVT: Supratherapeutic INR on admission; lovenox/coumadin held in the setting of GI bleed.
Duplex scan demonstrated no residual clot in either leg.
Derangement was believed to be hypovolemic hypernatremia, as he was made NPO and lacked access to free water.
Anticoagulation was witheld for concern for rebleeding and multiple episodes of GIB on coumadin in recent months.
Pt was made aware that he may continue to experience melenic stools for additional 5-7 days given his current constipation.
History of DVT: DVT diagnosed [**2104-11-25**], on coumadin prior to admission for DVT treatment and afib w high CHADS score.
DVT was in setting of recent immobilization after ankle fracture, and patient received approx 7 weeks of anticoagulation.
Recent LENI was negative for DVT obtained in MICU.
Discussion was held between PCP and inpatient team and given his recurrent GIB and gastric polyps decision was made to avoid anticoagulation for now.
Afib: Currently in paroxysmal afib with long PR, holding anticoagulation as above.
# HL: continued on home statin .
# Pancreatic tail lesion: Unclear significance.
# Urethral irritation: Foley cath was discontinued on [**1-16**] and pt reports some urethral discomfort since it was removed.
No polyuria, WBC or fever to suggest UTI.
Would expect some mild discomfort for couple days but if symptoms persist would obtain a UA to check for possible UTI.
UA checked prior to discharge on [**1-17**] was negative for WBC and suggested contamination rather than infection.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for bleeding in your stomach from polyps.
These were removed by endoscopy (swallowed camera test) and we consider them the likely source of your bleeding.
A leg ultrasound showed resolution of the blood clot in your leg.
It is important to note that some bleeding is still expected from your recent procedure.
Subsequently, hematocrit labs can be stopped and you can be followed clinically for any concern for bright red bleeding.
