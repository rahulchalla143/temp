History of Present Illness: This is a generally healthy 59-year-old woman with no significant past medical history who is transferred from LGH for bilateral lower extremity DVTs and PE.
Patient states that she was in her usual state of health until [**Holiday 1451**] when she noticed some swelling in her left leg.
Patient was doing well until [**Holiday **] time when she began developing shortness of breath with minimal exertion and pleuritic chest pain.
A large right-sided consolidation was seen on CTA, consistent either with pneumonia or less likely, pulmonary infarct.
An EKG showed sinus tachycardia without evidence of right heart strain.
ROS:  Positive for dyspnea on exertion, pleuritic right-sided chest pain, weakness.
Patient denies fevers/chills at home, recent weight loss, change in her stools, vaginal bleeding, or any other concerning signs or symptoms.
Past Medical History: Recent left lower extremity DVT  Social History: Patient lives with her husband, her daughter, and her grand-daughter.
Smoked 1PPD "forever" but recently cut down to 3-4 cigarettes/day after DVT diagnosis; used to drink 2 glasses of wine/night but stopped now that on coumadin.
No miscarriages.
Has not had a mammogram or a colonoscopy.
Family History: Sister with DVT and Factor V Leiden mutation.
Mother died of respiratory failure and father died of AD.
Physical Exam: Admission exam: Afebrile, 113/52, 93, 99% on 2L GENERAL:  Well appearing thin female, no acute distress HEENT:  No cervical, submandibular, or supraclavicular lymphadenpathy, throat is clear and non-erythematous BREAST EXAM:  Fibrous tissue in right breast, no nipple discharge, no axillary LAD CHEST:  Dullness at right lower base, poor airmovement throughout ABDOMEN: +BS, soft, non-tender, non-distended EXTREMITIES:  Marked swelling of lower legs bilaterally, tender GUAIC: Negative.
Discharge Exam: Tm99.8 Tc98.8 90 106/50 (100-120) 18 98RA GENERAL: Well appearing thin female, no acute distress EXTREMITIES: Marked swelling of lower legs bilaterally, calves minimally tender to palpation on right worse than left.
IV/V weakness on dorsiflexion, worse on the left than right.
Sinus tachycardia.
Short P-R interval.
T wave abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
CXR [**2158-12-11**]: chest read in conjunction with CT scanning of the chest earlier in the day performed elsewhere: Heterogeneous opacification at the base of the right lung conforms to the appearance on CT scanning earlier today, most likely pneumonia or extensive aspiration.
Small right pleural effusion is probably still present.
Mild emphysema is demonstrated on the CT scan.
Minimal ascites, tiny right pleural effusion and cystic pelvic masses, one of which in the right hemi-pelvis has a solid component.
These findings are strongly concerning for ovarian carcinoma.
Gallstones and no evidence of acute cholecystitis or biliary dilatation.
Large mixed solid and cystic pelvic mass, concerning for gynecologic malignancy (likely ovarian adenocarcinoma).
Trace complex ascites.
No definite evidence of intra-abdominal metastasis.
Evolving right lower lobe infarct, secondary to PE.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 59-year-old woman with a pmhx.
significant for recent left lower extremity DVT now with bilateral lower extremity DVTs and PE, who was found to have a pelvic mass on CT concerning for ovarian cancer.
PE/DVT:  She was initially admitted to the ICU for management of large PE/DVT, though there was no evidence of hemodynamic compromise or right heart strain.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound performed for an urelated reason showed ascites and a cystic pelvis mass concerning for ovarian cancer, which was again seen on pelvic CT scan.
Hypercoagulable state of malignancy is a likely precipitant in her case, though there is possibly a compressive mass-effect of the mass as well causing hemostasis.
OVARIAN MASS:  LFT abnormalities prompted an abdominal US, which showed complex ascites and a pelvic mass with cystic and solid components.
A follow up CT scan confirmed the presence of a mass highly concerning for ovarian adenocarcinoma.
Her INR will need to normalize before this procedure, so she was transitioned to lovenox for ease of reversal prior to procedures, and increased efficacy in malignancy.
FEVER/CONSOLIDATION ON CT:  She was started on levaquin in the ICU on [**12-11**] for CXR evidence of RLL consolidation that was thought to be infection versus infarction.
Her levaquin was stopped on [**12-14**] as she was afebrile without leukocytosis.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: She will require prompt followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for coordination of her biopsy and further care of a potential ovarian malignancy.
