His current symptoms include dyspnea on exertion, chills, night sweats, extremely poor PO intake.
The patient also reports several days of crampy abdominal pain & diarrhea.
He denied dizziness and lightheadedness.
He had a CXR and CT that showed enlarged pleural effusion on the left.
250 cc of serous fluid was drained.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient states that he is thirsty but that his breathing has improved dramatically.
Also feels slight wheeze.

Extensive metastatic disease within the chest.
Extensive metastatic disease within the chest, including mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy and extensive pulmonary nodularity and both hilar and perihilar consolidations.
Increased consolidations in the left lower lobe, lingula and right lower lobe likely account for acute symptoms of tachypnea.
Slight increase in left loculated pleural effusion and interval development of a small right pleural effusion.
Metastatic disease burden in the abdomen appears overall stable with retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
Small volume ascites is new from prior exam with mild bowel wall thickening along the distal colon, likely indicative of colitis (inflammatory versus infectious, versus ischemic).
No central PE identified.
Severe consolidation in most of the left lower lung and in a smaller region of the right lower lung has improved slightly on the left, worsened slightly on the right.
Previous pulmonary edema has improved.
Extensive pleural mass surrounds the left lung and small pleural effusion and is collected in a nondependent fashion, probably unchanged in overall volume since the earlier study.
Small right pleural effusion layers dependently.
Heart size is normal, but mediastinal contours and the enlarged left hilum reflect extensive central lymph node enlargement.

Brief Hospital Course: REASON FOR ICU ADMISSION:  45 M with metastatic RCC s/p multiple chemo regimens p/w fevers, cough, SOB, hypotension as well as abdominal pain with diarrhea x 2-3 days.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  # Acute respiratory failure, with post obstructive pneumonia and progressive tumor burden, and pleural effusion: Dr. [**Known lastname 22998**] presented with increased shortness of breath, with CT scan that revealed significant disease progression in his left lung, but no pulmonary embolism.
Given his recent hospitalization and evidence of new L-lung consolidation, he was treated empirically for HCAP.
However, the findings on his chest CT were possibly infectious, but also most likely related to incresed tumor burden.
Cultures from thoracentesis showed no growth.
# Colitis: The patient had abdominal pain for the past several days as well as diarrhea.
His CT showed evidence of distal descending & sigmoid colitis.
Given recent hospitalization and antibiotic administration there was c/f C.Diff and he was started on IV flagyl and PO vancomycin.
However he had decreased stool output, and ultimately C.Diff PCR was negative, so po vancomycin was discontinued.
CT abdomen showed some mild bowel wall thickening along the distal colon, likely indicative of colitis (report said inflammatory vs infectious vs ischemic).
It was felt this was not ischemic colitis.
# Renal Cell Carcinoma: The patient is on daily tarceva.
Home oxycodone 5-10 mg Q4H prn and dilaudid for breakthrough pain were continued, and his Oxycodone was renewed on discharge with #90 tablets.
I suggested to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] that he consider offering further psychosocial support to patient who is dealing with a devastating disease while trying to support his family (wife and two children).
Other cell lines are not involved, arguing against myelophistic process.
# Transaminitis/LFT Abnormality: Pt with evidence of transaminitis in 100s on admission.
No elevation in bilirubin.
Could be med side effect vs. acute illness vs. hepatitis.
Could be due to sepsis, acute illness, malignancy, poor nutritional Vit K intake.
# Tachycardia; patient with borderine tachycardia that was fluid responsive prior to discharge.
Is at risk for volume depletion with decreased PO intake.
Medications on Admission: - Oxycodone 5 mg Q6H PRN pain - Tarceva 150 mg QD   Discharge Medications: 1. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
5. acetaminophen 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain or fever.
Disp:*9 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Pneumonia Renal cell cancer w/ metastasis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with respiratory failure, likely related to both post obstructive pneumonia and progressive metastatic disease to your lungs, as well as the pleural effusion.
Your CT scan showed mild colitis affecting the distal descending and sigmoid colon.
Stool studies were negative for infection.
