Admission Date:  [**2126-6-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2126-6-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2046-5-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**] Chief Complaint: " I'm listing to the left"  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**6-15**]: Right frontal craniotomy and mass resection  History of Present Illness: HPI: 80yo woman with history of small cell lung CA (diagnosed 3 yrs ago) receiving chemotherapy (last dose 5 weeks ago) was in usual state of health until approximately 3 days ago when her daughter and [**Name2 (NI) 22858**] noted that she was tired, not ambulating independently (and leaning to the left when she did), was confused, and  had decreased short term memory.
She presented to [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital [**6-13**] AM where a head CT was obtained and suspicious for right frontal mass.
Past Medical History: HTN HL Hypothyroid DM anemia s/p Appy s/p C-section x2   Social History: Social Hx: lives with daughter and granddaughter.
90pack yr history of tobacco use, no etoh.
Orientation: Oriented to person  Cranial Nerves: I: Not tested II: right Pupil round and reactive to light, left pupil is hazy,nonreactive and the patient has no vision.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
left pronator drift  Sensation: Intact to light touch  Reflexes: Br Pa Ac Right     1   0  1 Left      1   0  1  Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: finger-nose-finger and rapid alternating movements decreased on left  ******* PHYSICAL EXAM UPON DISCHARGE *******   Pertinent Results: [**6-13**] Head CT : IMPRESSION: Likely right frontal mass with surrounding vasogenic edema.
Possible left frontal mass.
Dominant 4.2 cm right frontal mass with heterogeneous enhancement and superficial extension to the brain surface, where there is overlying dural thickening concerning for broader dissemination of tumor, transgressing the subarachnoid space.
There is a moderate degree of associated vasogenic edema and mass effect.
Otherwise, innumerable smaller metastatic lesions throughout both the supra- and infratentorial compartments.
[**6-14**] Chest/Abd/Pelvis CT: IMPRESSION: 1.
Necrotic right lower lobe pulmonary mass with multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules.
Enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes concerning for metastatic disesae.
Left hilar lymph node measuring 8 mm.
Otherwise, no evidence for metastatic disease.
Multiple minimally displaced right-sided healing rib fractures without bone destruction.
Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Small amount of extra- and intra-axial hemorrhage and pneumocephalus at the right frontal resection site.
Persistent vasogenic edema, but interval decrease in degree of shift.
Known left frontal mass with associated edema, and additional innumerable metastases (identified by recent MRI) not appreciated, as there is little associated edema.
Slightly limited evaluation of the right frontal surgical site due to the absence of pre-contrast T1-weighted images in the axial plane.
Questionable nodular contrast enhancement along the superior medial aspect of the surgical cavity.
Numerous small supratentorial and infratentorial metastases with mild associated edema, as seen on [**2126-6-14**].
[**6-18**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: Expected evolution of postsurgical changes in the right frontal lobe.
No evidence of new abnormalities.
[**6-18**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Known large right lower lobe mass.
No evidence of aspiration.
Blood Gas [**2126-6-19**] 08:07    ART             108* 52* 7.36 31* 2 NOT INTUBA1 [**2126-6-18**] 17:17    ART             97 47* 7.38 29 1 NOT INTUBA1 O2   Brief Hospital Course: This is an 80 year old female with PMH of metastatic small cell lung cancer who presented for evaluation of left sided weakness and confusion and was found to have a right frontal lobe brain mass for which a craniotomy and resection was performed by neurosurgery on [**2126-6-14**].
Her post-operative course was complicated by respiratory failure requiring transfer to the MICU from the neurosurgical service for initiation of biPAP, steroids, and an empiric course of antibiotics which resolved her respiratory distress.
An enema was attempted for her comfort, but was unable to be passed rectally.
She should be continued on a maximal bowel regimen for her comfort.
She was never nauseous and had no signs of obstruction.
Brain metastasis s/p surgery: The patient was found to have a right frontal lobe brain mass likely from metastasis of her known small cell lung cancer.
She had left sided weakness on exam, but did not have a seizure.
She was started on Keppra and Decadron and taken to the OR by neurosurgery for a craniotomy and right frontal lobe mass resection without complication.
Post-operatively she was alert and oriented x3 with left facial droop/pronator drift and 4/5 weakness of the left upper extremity.
A post-operative head CT was obtained within 4 hours as well as an MRI for post operative evaluation.
Both revealed normal post operative changes and no significant hemmorrhage.
This revealed no significant changes from the previous post operative scan.
A CXR was also obtained for increasing respiratory distress which was negative for aspiration.
The neurology team was consulted for help evaluating the increasing confusion/unresponsiveness and they recommended an EEG.
This was done and revealed that she was encephalopathic but had no seizure activity.
She became unresponsive for several days in the ICU, but her mental status improved spontaneously with treatment of her respiratory failure detailed below.
She was also continued on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
On [**6-19**], the patient was noted to continue with respiratory distress.
It is likely that she developed aspiration PNA/pneumonitis in the setting of altered mental status post-operatively.
She did have leukocytosis, but it is unclear whether it was steroid related vs. an infection.
A COPD exacerbation is also a possibility given her underlying lung disease.
Less likely PE or CHF as the patient has improved dramatically with abx and steroids alone.
Solumedrol 125 mg IV q8H was initiated on [**6-19**] for presumed COPD flare as well as anti-inflammatory effect following extensive neurosurgical procedure, which was tapered to dexamethsone 2mg PO BID indefinitely per neurosurgical recommendations.
The etiology of her altered mental status was likely from post-op changes after neurosurgery in the setting of poor respiratory status from possible infection vs COPD exacerbation.
An EEG was performed on [**6-18**] and showed evidence of a moderate encephalopathy perhaps stemming from metabolic derangements, medications, infection, anoxia, or hypercarbia.
Likely prerenal etiology due to poor PO intake.
Small Cell Lung Ca: On [**6-15**] she underwent the CT torso which revealed necrotic RLL mass.
The mass may have been contributing to her respiratory distress as it could be obstructing a bronchus.
No anticoagulation was given due to multiple brain mets and recent post-op status.
Likely secondary to both steroid dosing and infection described above.
# DM: The patient had increased hyperglycemia secondary to steroid dosing which responded to increased glargine up to 20 units and Humalog insulin sliding scale.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Right Frontal Brain mass s/p craniotomy and resection Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] for evaluation of left sided weakness and confusion.
You were found to have a right sided brain metastasis of your known lung cancer.
You became extremely short of breath after your surgery and required care in the intensive care unit to improve your breathing.
