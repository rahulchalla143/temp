Bilateral ureteric stents (placed by urology team).
Resection of ileorectal anastomosis.
Redo ileorectal anastomosis.
He expressed his desire to proceed with surgical intervention to address these colonic polyps.
Past Medical History: Anemia, iron deficiency Inguinal hernia, s/p repair with mesh [**2122-7-3**] Colonic adenoma Obesity, morbid Thyroiditis - chronic lymphocytic Atrial fibrillation - on chronic coumadin Hypertension COPD Hyperlipidemia Sleep Apnea    Social History: Lives alone, smoked 1 ppd x 30 years, hx of alcoholism 20 years ago, no IVDU   Family History: Family History Of Ulcerative Colitis   Physical Exam: Upon Discharge: Vitals - 98.6  97.9  69  124/54  20  96%RA Gen - AAOx3, in no apparent distress CV - RRR +S1/S2 Resp - CTAB Abd - soft, mildly tender to deep palpation per-incisionally, nondistended, +BS, no rebound/rigidity/guarding, no palpable masses, VAC in place Inc - VAC in place to good suction @125 mmHG, no leaks, draininge serosanguinous output Ext - varicosities noted, no edema/cyanosis/clubbing   Pertinent Results: OPERATIVE PATHOLOGY ([**2122-7-31**]): 1.
Total abdominal colon, colectomy (D-BH) - Twenty-seven adenomas, ranging from 0.3 - 4.7 cm, two with focal high-grade dysplasia; no invasive adenoma identified.
Hernia sac ([**Hospital1 **]) - Fibroadipose tissue consistent with hernia sac.
Exam is severely limited due to patient body habitus.
There is inferior extension of the extravasated contrast and gas containing material into the right inguinal canal.
Marked gastric distention.
Multiple dilated proximal small bowel loops with change in caliber distally, although an abrupt transition point is not identified.
Findings could be related to ileus, however a partial small bowel obstruction cannot be excluded.
Limited evaluation of the distal pulmonary arterial branches, however, no central or segmental pulmonary thromboembolic disease.
No pulmonary arterial hypertension or right ventricular strain.
Bilateral basilar airspace disease may represent atelectasis, however infectious consolidation is difficult to exclude.
OPERATIVE PATHOLOGY ([**2122-8-2**]): Ileorectal anastomosis, excision (A-B) - Viable intestinal tissue with acute serositis.
CHEST X-RAY ([**2122-8-3**]): Lung volumes remain quite low with most severe atelectasis at the base in both lower lungs, slightly worse today on the left than it was yesterday.
There has been some improvement in mild pulmonary vascular congestion, but there is no pulmonary edema.
No pneumothorax.
Exam is severely limited due to patient's body habitus.
Within these limitations, no evidence of leak of rectal contrast.
Rim-enhancing fluid collection with air in the anterior abdominal wall soft tissues extending from the right rectus to the right scrotal sac without clear connection to bowel.
Small left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.
Umbilical hernia repair.
Bilateral ureteric stents (placed by urology team).
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter, JP drain, and intermittent IV dilaudid for pain control.
He was placed on telemetry for a history of atrial fibrillation.
On this day, he experienced an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, sustained HR to 140s, which broke and resolved with 10 mg of IV lopressor.
On POD#2 ([**8-2**]): The patient experienced sudden-onset dyspnea, RR 34, tachycardia to HR 130s, sever abdominal pain, and an increase in WBC.
A CT scan was performed (reader referred to 'Pertinent Results' section for full details) which raised concern for peritonitis due to a leak from the blind end of the ileum.
Resection of ileorectal anastomosis.
Redo ileorectal anastomosis.
He was NPO, on IV fluids, on a diltiazem drip for atrial fibrillation, with a Foley catheter, JP drain, and NG tube in place.
A dilaudid PCA was provided for effective pain control.
On POD#[**3-9**] ([**8-4**]): The patient experienced an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, HR sustained in 140s, SBP 110-120s.
His pain remained well-controlled with a PCA.
He was placed on home PO meds (both for home medications) but a PCA was maintained for pain control.
He was given his home medications as usual, and had pain control with a PCA.
He was transitioned to oral medications for pain control.
Erythromycin and reglan were discontinued on this day due to increased bowel movements.
His JP drain was removed, all staples removed from his incision, and a wound VAC was placed.
Imodium was started, and reduced the frequency of his frequent bowel movements.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
OxycoDONE (Immediate Release)  5-10 mg PO Q4H pain Please hold for oversedation or RR < 12.
Incision Wound VAC care: *Please maintain the wound VAC with regular (every 2 day) changes *Please use a standard VAC black sponge in the wound *The VAC should always be placed to good suction at 125 mmHg, with no leaks *Please check the VAC regularly for any leaks or defects *Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or output from the VAC.
Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you experience the following: *You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or tightness.
*New or worsening cough, shortness of breath, or wheeze.
*If you are vomiting and cannot keep down fluids or your medications.
*You are getting dehydrated due to continued vomiting, diarrhea, or other reasons.
Signs of dehydration include dry mouth, rapid heartbeat, or feeling dizzy or faint when standing.
*Your pain is not improving within 8-12 hours or is not gone within 24 hours.
