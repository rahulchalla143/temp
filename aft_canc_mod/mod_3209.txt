Interval progression of bulky supraclavicular, mediastinal, and hilar lymphadenopathy with progression of mass-like consolidation of the right lower lobe.
It is unclear to what extent the progression of consolidation in the right lower lobe represents progression of tumor versus superimposed pneumonia.
Consolidation in the right middle and upper lobes presumably represents an infectious pneumonia.

Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Chronic supra-azygous SVC occlusion.
