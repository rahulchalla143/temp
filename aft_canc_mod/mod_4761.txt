Brief Hospital Course: Patient was taken to the operating room on [**2132-4-5**] for [**Month (only) **] of her rectal carcinoma.
Pain was controlled with a high epidural.
After being normalized with supportive measures, her pain was managed in the PACU with a dilaudid PCA.
She continued to have a respiratory acidosis after receiving IV dilaudid and was re-intubated.
In the morning of POD#1, her ventilator was weaned and she was started on toradol for pain control.
Overnight on POD#1, she was short of breath and disoriented and reportedly bradycardic.
Cardiology was consulted and was unable to find evidence of cardiac issues or documented bradycardia on the telemetry monitor - leads were off / artifactual during episode.
A CTA was performed to rule out a pulmonary embolus and was negative for PE but showed atelectasis.
Her diet was advanced as the stoma began to have flatus and output.
