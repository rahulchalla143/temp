Admission Date:  [**2187-12-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2187-12-18**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2279**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness:  Ms. [**Known lastname 4248**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old woman with HTN presenting with two days of worsening dyspnea on exertion.
She described that she initally did not have symptoms at rest, however this on the morning of presentation she describes dyspnea to the point of extreme fatigue even with standing still and intermittent left sided chest discomfort prompting presentation to BIDN ED.
Initial vitals at BIDN were 98.4 83 132/59 20 89% RA and was noted to have difficulty breathing while lying down.
Patient's presenting EKG showed ST elevations in the inferior leads and symptoms are initially concerning for unstable angina/ ACS.
Subsequent CTA, performed prior to starting anticoagulation, revealed bilateral PEs with evidence of RV>LV suggestive of right heart strain.
CT head was negative for mass or bleed and the patient was started on a heparin drip and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
A chest X-ray was repeated in the ED and revealed no evidence of congestive heart failure and right-sided calcified pleural plaques.
The patient was then admitted to the MICU given convern for right heart strain in the setting of BL PEs.
On the floor the patient appears comfortable and is without chest pain, shortness of breath or additional complaints.
Review of sytems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

Right-sided calcified pleural plaques.
ECHO: Mildly dilated right ventricle with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Very mild pulmonary hypertension.
Deep vein thrombosis seen within the left popliteal and the left posterior tibial veins.
Occlusive thrombus is also noted within the right greater saphenous vein.
A 2 x 3 cm necrotic mass in the tail of the pancreas most likely represents a primary pancreatic malignancy.
Enhancing nodules within the breast parenchyma bilaterally could represent metastases versus primary malignancy.
DISCHARGE LABS: [**2187-12-16**] 01:05PM BLOOD WBC-7.8 RBC-3.40* Hgb-9.8* Hct-29.7* MCV-87 MCH-28.6 MCHC-32.8 RDW-13.0 Plt Ct-195 [**2187-12-17**] 05:50AM BLOOD PT-28.1* INR(PT)-2.7* [**2187-12-16**] 01:05PM BLOOD Glucose-171* UreaN-10 Creat-0.5 Na-133 K-4.1 Cl-98 HCO3-25 AnGap-14 [**2187-12-16**] 01:05PM BLOOD Calcium-8.5 Phos-3.2 Mg-2.1   Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year-old woman with a history of HTN and remote history of TB presents with acute onset dyspnea admitted for bilateral pulmonary emboli found to have evidence of metastatic pancreatic cancer on CT.  #.
Bilateral pulmonary emboli: Patient had evidence of bilateral pulmonary emboli involving the RML, RUL, LUL nad LLL.
There was a suggestion of right heart strain with flattening on interventricular septum on chest CT, however bedside ultrasound in the ED did not reveal evidence of right heart strain.
Echocardiogram showed mildly dilated RV with normal biventricular function.
LE ultrasound showed bilateral DVTs.
Chest CTA at [**Hospital1 **]-N showed multiple nodules in liver so CT A/P was pursued to work up possible malignancy as source of PE.
CT A/P showed necrotic pancreatic tail mass and "numerous hypodense lesions with peripheral arterial enhancement most consistent with metastases" in the liver.
# suspected metastatic pancreatic cancer: PE work up for hypercoagulability showed necrotic pancreatic tail mass and "numerous hypodense lesions with peripheral arterial enhancement most consistent with metastases" in the liver as mentioned above.
This most likely represents a primary pancreatic malignancy that has metastasized (especially considered it is a very clot-prone malignancy).
There are also some breast calcifications bilaterally but the significance of this is unknown.
Explained to patient the likelihood that this is a cancerous process, but that it is difficult to predict prognosis or treatment options without biopsy.
Pt discussed options with social work and palliative care and decided not to pursue any further work-up or treatment and prefers not to discuss results any further.
She was made aware that if she developed symptoms such as pain, she could seek symptomatic treatment at that time.
Elevated Troponin: Patient has an elevated troponin to 0.13 at 10AM at BIDN.
Follow up troponin at [**Hospital1 18**] at 1PM was 0.13 with CKMB or 7, which was peak level after which it trended down.
Elevated troponin in unlikely to represent ACS and likely represented right heart strain [**1-31**] PE.
CODE: Full (confirmed with patient) TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 1. continue lovenox for PE treatment 2. if begins to develop symptoms such as abdominal pain, pt should be encouraged to speak with PCP about pain control and asked if she would like to revisit malignancy work up or treatment 3. follow up BP on new regimen  Medications on Admission: - Atenolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **] - [**2187-12-10**] - Felodipine ER 10mg daily - [**2187-10-19**] - may not be taking - Lisinopril 30mg daily - [**2187-11-28**] - Flonase 50mcg nasal spray 2 puffs each nostril once daily - [**12-10**] - preservision daily  Discharge Medications: 1. labetalol 200 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
7. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
8. polyvinyl alcohol 1.4 % Drops Sig: 1-2 Drops Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dryness.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Residence - [**University/College **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: pulmonary embolism bilateral deep vein thrombosis necrotic pancreatic tail mass with multiple liver nodules on CT  Secondary Diagnoses: hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital because you had a pulmonary embolism in your lungs and deep vein thromboses (clots) in your legs.
You were given medications to treat the clots and discharged to rehab with oxygen.
You also developed a urinary tract infection so you were started on antibiotics for this.
