Admission Date:  [**2157-4-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2157-5-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2077-10-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfanilamide / Digoxin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea on exertion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 86630**] is a 79 year old male with history of Pulm fibrosis, coronary artery disease status post CABG x 4 vessels in [**2134**], paroxysmal atrial fibrilation status post ablation x 2 and recent failed cardioversion who was recently admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital after for severe dyspnea and diaphoresis.
At the outside hospital he underwent a cardiac cath on [**2157-4-5**] which revealed 3 vessel disease.
He was readmitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital [**2157-4-13**] for progressive fatigue and shortness of breath.
During this admission he also complained of poor PO intake and regurgitant food.
He had an EGD and barium swallow that showed dilated esophagus with erosion but no Zenker's or strictures.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8579**] recommended performing a Persantine thallium test which showed moderate size lateral wall ischemia extending to portions of the anterior and inferior walls; with preserved LVEF.
If this did not improve his SOB, a pulmonary process would be persued.
Dyslipidemia 7.
Spinal stenosis 8. degenerative arthritis 9. cataract s/p surgery both eyes 10.
Hypertension   Social History: Retired technician.
[**Date range (1) 86633**] Blood and urine cultures no growth/pending .
Foci of possible decreased diffusion adjacent to the trigone of the right lateral ventricle and in the left centrum semiovale, raise the possibility of relatively acute infarcts, likely embolic in nature (and, apparently, the patient does have a history of atrial flutter).
Focus of enhancement in the right basal ganglia on the sagittal MP-RAGE sequence, with no definite correlate on the other sequences.
Ventricles and sulci appear proportionately enlarged, and findings likely represent age-related global atrophy.
Multifocal T2- and FLAIR-hyperintensity within the white matter are a nonspecific finding, but may represent sequelae of chronic microvascular ischemia, given the patient's age and possible evidence of additional punctate acute infarcts.
There is a break in the primary peristaltic esophageal contraction in the very proximalesophagus.
There is no clearance with secondary contraction.
The proximal esophagus is extremely patulous extending from approximately T1 through T3.
There is a small amount of residual material seen within this dilated area.
There is arounded, extrinsic impression along the posterior border of the esophagus at this level.
There is normal relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter.
Extrinsic impression at the distal end of this dilated area could represent an aberrant right subclavian artery.
Moderate esophageal dysmotility.
[**4-30**] EEG This is an abnormal portable EEG due to slowing and disorganization of the background rhythm consistent with a mild to moderate encephalopathy.
No areas of focal slowing, epileptiform discharges, or electrographic seizures were seen during this recording.
Extensive dilatation and irregularity of the dorsal pancreatic duct measuring up to 1.2 cm in the head and 7 mm in the body.
No worrisome features for the malignancy such as enhancing nodules were seen, but the interpretation for enhancement is limited due to non-breath holding technique.
Gallbladder wall edema and small amount of fluid in the paracolic gutters.
Findings are consistent with prior asbestos exposure and asbestos related disease.
[**5-4**] CXR Increasing opacification of the left hemithorax has progressed over the past 2-3 days is most likely a now large pleural effusion, consolidation may be also present.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 86630**] is a 79 year old man with pulmonary fibrosis, atrial fibrillation, CAD s/p CABG and recent stenting who presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital with worsening fatigue/SOB and was found to have abnormal persantine thallium test.
Brief highlights of this extended hospital stay are as follows -  He was initially admitted to the cardiology service where further history indicated a subacute progression of his exertional SOB; which ischemic MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1902**] were considered ultimately focus shifted to failure to thrive workup and evaluation of weakness and swallowing difficulties.
Patient's PO intake had been poor at home, with generalized weakness and progressive functional decline.
Though depression was felt to be likely contributory to this he underwent he did have evidence of esophageal dysmotility and oropharyngeal dysphagia.
Patient subsequently underwent EGD which was notable for gastric ulcers.
Post procedure, patient developed respiratory distress in PACU, felt likely aspiration event.
He remained weak and lethargic, though he did have moments where his alertness and interactivity were improved.
He was seen by the neurology service for evaluation of a possible neurologic cause of his decline - no definitive diagnosis was established during this hospitalization.
MRI of the brain showed evidence of chronic microvascular disease.
EEG showed diffuse slowing.
CSF analysis was limited by small volume of fluid that could be obtained.
We considered the possibility of a paraneoplastic neuromuscular disorder.
While there was initial question of pancreatic lesion which was ruled out on MRCP.
Also considered multiple systems atrophy or olivopontocerebellar atrophy.
The evening prior to admission, patient developed increased secretions, lethargy, and hypercapneic respiratory failure.
