# Febrile Neutropenia.
Diagnostic paracentesis was considered to rule out the possibility of SBP, but no suitable fluid pocket could be identified for safe bedside paracentesis.
Her fever resolved within 24 hours of admission and she remained afebrile throughout the remainder of her hospital stay.
12-lead EKG was obtained which showed sinus tachycardia.
This was felt likely secondary to fever/infection, as when her fevers resolved her heart rate decreased to 90s-100s.
#Abnormal LFTs: Patient was noted to have a transaminitis as above.
This was felt possibly secondary to known liver metastases vs. toxicity from recent chemotherapy.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] went out of the ICU to the oncology (OMED) service on hospital day #2, where she remained afebrile and normotensive and was discharged to home with services.
- Patient at higher risk for readmission due to reaccumulating ascites and ongoing issues with pain (although under better control than admission).
