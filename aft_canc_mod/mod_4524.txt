Procedure date     Tissue received     Report Date    Diagnosed by [**2139-10-27**] [**2139-10-27**] [**2139-11-2**] DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]/ttl DIAGNOSIS: I.  Portal lymph nodes (A-D): Three lymph nodes with no carcinoma seen (0/3).
Chronic cholecystitis with cholesterolosis and mural fibrosis.
C.  No carcinoma seen.
Bile duct margin (K): Segment of bile duct with focal periductal glandular complexity; no definite carcinoma or dysplasia seen.
Jejunum (L-O): Small intestinal segment, within normal limits.
Six of twenty-two regional lymph nodes (periampullary and peripancreatic nodes), involved by adenocarcinoma ([**7-28**]).

Distal Extrahepatic Bile Duct Resection Synopsis Includes Local / Segmental Resections and Pancreaticoduodenectomy Specimens Staging according to American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual -- 7th Edition, [**2138**] MACROSCOPIC Specimen Type:  Common bile duct.
Primary Tumor (pT):  pT3: Tumor invades the gallbladder, pancreas, duodenum or other adjacent organs without involvement of the celiac axis or superior mesenteric artery.
MARGINS: Segmental Resection Margins:         Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma:         Distance of invasive carcinoma from closest margin:         Specify margin:  <1 mm (posterior retroperitoneal).
Distal Pancreatic Margin: Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma.
Comments:  Tumor is present within lymph node parenchyma less than 1 mm from the inked retroperitoneal pancreatic margin.
[**2139-10-28**] EKG: Sinus rhythm.
Precordial T wave abnormalities.
[**2139-10-30**] EKG: Sinus rhythm.
Left anterior fascicular block.
There is a late transition with anterior and anterolateral ST-T wave changes consistent with possible prior anterior myocardial infarction.
[**2139-10-27**] CHEST PORT: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-19**]: Lung volumes are generally lower, suggesting that bilateral infrahilar consolidation is probably atelectasis.
Small left pleural effusion is new.
There is no pleural effusion on the right or any indication of pneumothorax.
A 37 mm long straight metallic linear opacity projecting to the left of the neck is also present on subsequent study 4:43 a.m. on [**10-28**].
[**2139-10-31**] CHEST PORT: FINDINGS: Frontal chest radiograph is compared to the prior study from [**10-30**].
There is dense left lower lobe consolidation with moderate left-sided pleural effusion.
There is mild congestive failure.
No evidence of free air to suggest perforation.
Air-filled loops of large and small bowel are seen with distention of the small bowel concerning for postoperative ileus, though early partial small- bowel obstruction cannot be excluded.
Imaging findings most suggestive of focal ileus involving portion of the pancreaticobiliary limb and proximal jejunum about duodenojejunal anastomotic site and near J-tube entrance.
No fluid collection is noted about the blind-ending portion of the hepaticobiliary limb nor is there any extraluminal enteric contrast.
Oral contrast within the distal esophagus and stomach also suggests underlying esophageal/gastric ileus or dysmotility.
Interval development of small bilateral simple pleural effusions with adjacent regions of lower lobe compressive atelectasis.
Mild edema involving the base of the cecum of unclear etiology with no other findings of enteritis or colitis.
No discrete collections or abscesses identified.
Thickening of the adjacent hepaticojejunostomy bowel loops may be secondary to underdistension.
No evidence of small-bowel obstruction.
Moderate cardiomegaly with enlargement of the left ventricle.
Mild residual pulmonary edema.
Minimal left pleural effusion.
No newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities.
Again, there are low lung volumes with atelectatic changes and effusion at the left base in the retrocardiac region.
No definite vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient with history of biliary malignancy was admitted to the General Surgical Service for elective Whipple procedure.
On [**2139-10-27**], the patient underwent Pylorus-preserving Whipple's pancreaticoduodenectomy, open cholecystectomy, jejunostomy tube placement and placement of CyberKnife gold fiducial seeds for radiation therapy, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
After a surgery patient was transferred in ICU secondary to respiratory distress and hypotension.
On POD # 1 patient was extubated, he self discontinued NGT, and hypotension was improved with IV fluid.
When tolerating oral intake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications - Oxycodone.
Currently patient taking PO Tylenol prn for pain control.
On POD # 22 patient was triggered for acute mental status change.
Patient had several episodes of tachycardia, especially with activities, which were treated IV Lopressor with good respond.
On POD # 12, patient developed persistent sinus tachycardia with HR 120s, did not improved with IV Metoprolol, patient was transferred into ICU.
On the floor patient's cardiac status was continued to be monitored with telemetry unit, patient continue to have episodes of tachycardia and PVCs without any symptoms, patient was restarted on his home medications when tolerated PO.
On POD # 22, patient was triggered for episode of tachycardia and mental status change, patient returned back to his baseline without any interventions.
On POD # 12, patient was triggered for persistent tachycardia and tachypnea, he was transferred into ICU.
JPs amylase was sent and result of output was high ([**Numeric Identifier 86924**] - JP#1, [**Numeric Identifier 86925**] -JP#2), patient was continued on Octreotide IV for treatment of pancreatic leak.
Patient's TF was advanced to goal on POD # 15, repeat abdominal CT scan was negative for ileus or SBO.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Patient remained afebrile during hospitalization.
After initiation of tube feed, patient developed frequent, loose stool.
Stool was sent for c-diff and was found to be positive.
Patient's urine and blood were negative for infection during hospitalization.
On   Wound was examined routinely and no signs or symptoms of infection were noticed.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a clear liquid diet and TF up to his goal, ambulating with assist, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
5. miconazole nitrate 2 % Powder Sig: One (1) Appl Topical TID (3 times a day) as needed for peri area.
Tylenol 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO every six (6) hours as needed for fever or pain.
Incision Care: *Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision site.
*You may shower, and wash surgical incisions with a mild soap and warm water.
JP Drain Care: *Please look at the site every day for signs of infection (increased redness or pain, swelling, odor, yellow or bloody discharge, warm to touch, fever).
*Make sure to keep the drain attached securely to your body to prevent pulling or dislocation.
