[**2197-12-9**] Flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration [**2197-12-18**] Flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration and bronchoalveolar lavage [**2197-12-20**] Tracheostomy, bronchoscopy, insertion of left subclavian hemodialysis catheter   History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 86746**] is a 62 year old female with stage T3 N1 signet ring adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus who recently completed induction chemotherapy.
Since that time she has had a PET scan for repeat staging which showed persistent upper mediastinal adenopathy, and head MRI revealing a suprasellar lesion that was biopsied by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and found to be consistent with a benign cyst.
Biopsy of the  mediastinal nodes revealed only non-necrotizing granulomas with no evidence for metastasis.

ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal with thoracic epidural.
INDICATIONS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 86746**] is a 62-year-old woman with biopsy- proven T3, N1, stage III carcinoma of the distal esophagus with lymph nodes that were PET-positive extending well up into the superior thorax.
Residual PET- positive lymph nodes were evaluated thoracoscopically and with mediastinoscopy and were found to be sarcoidal.
Without evidence of disease progression, I recommended resection and she agreed to proceed.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the operating room after the insertion of a thoracic epidural catheter.
She underwent the uneventful induction of general endotracheal anesthesia.
No endobronchial purulence, tumor, or blood was noted to the subsegmental level.
The upper GI endoscope was used to assess for residual endoluminal tumor.
There was what appeared to be a healed bland ulcer in the distal esophagus, at the site of the former tumor.
There was no visualized tumor along the lesser curvature using a retroflexed view of the GE junction.
The patient was positioned in the left lateral decubitus position, and the right chest was prepped and draped as a single sterile field.
Circumferential dissection of the esophagus was then carried out beginning in the subcarinal space.
The esophagus was looped with a Penrose drain and dissected free of its mediastinal attachments down to the crura of the diaphragm inferiorly.
Subcarinal lymph nodes were sampled, and one was submitted to pathology, which showed only a hyalinized nodule.
Paraesophageal nodes in the inferior ligament and at level VIII were included with the specimen.
A small Penrose drain was knotted around the specimen and passed into the neck for subsequent retrieval.
Palpation of the lung revealed no nodules.
It was secured to the skin with heavy suture and connected to a Pleur-Evac with an underwater seal.
The muscular chest was closed in layers with absorbable suture, and the skin was closed in the subcuticular fashion.
A midline abdominal incision was made, and the peritoneum was entered through the linea [**Female First Name (un) **].
Inspection revealed no ascites.
There was no studding of the omentum.
There were no nodules palpated in the liver.
There was thickening at the GE junction and no gross adenopathy along the left gastric artery.
The small bowel was run from the ileocecal valve up approximately to the level of the jejunostomy and there were no lesions.
There were no colonic abnormalities palpated, and no pathology was noted in the pelvis.
Lymphoid tissue was then swept up towards the stomach, and the balance of this dissection was done with the cautery.
We turned our attention to the left neck where we made an oblique incision along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.
Areolar tissue in the wound was separated, allowing adequate mobilization in the neck.
The esophagus was elevated and controlled with a linear stapler at the level of the clavicular heads.
Umbilical tape was secured around the proximal portion of the specimen, and the esophagus was divided after pulling the NG tube back to above the stapler.
There was definite foreshortening and induration along the lesser curvature, and we divided 2 branches of the right gastric artery to clean off the lesser curvature of the stomach.
The left gastric nodal packet was dissected away from the specimen and this was submitted to pathology.
Distally, there were a few isolated signet cells in the submucosa with overlying normal mucosa.
The back row of 3-0 silk interrupted sutures was placed and left with the knots on the inside.
This was returned to the posterior aspect of the neck and upper mediastinum where it lay under no tension.
The conduit was tacked to the enlarged hiatus with 2-0 silk interrupted sutures in 3 places to prevent herniation of peritoneal contents into the thorax.
Pneumothorax and effusion.
No pneumothorax identified.
Similar postoperative findings in left neck area consistent with esophagectomy.
***** [**2197-12-8**] CHEST XRAY: REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Shortness of breath in a patient second day after esophagectomy.
Interval significant progression of the right lung consolidation currently involving almost entire right lung is consistent with aspiration pneumonia progression.
Left lung linear atelectasis is unchanged.
The small bilateral pleural effusions did not change significantly and there is no pneumothorax  ***** [**2197-12-10**] BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right and left common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed.
There is no evidence of intraluminal thrombus.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of lower extremity DVT bilaterally.
A small pericardial effusion is noted.
In the mediastinum, just anterior to the left main stem bronchus, a 17 x 23-mm relatively high density (40 [**Doctor Last Name **]) round fluid collection may represent a small hematoma.
Stranding in the mediastinum is likely due to recent esophagectomy.
A small right apical pneumothorax and small amount of air in anterior right costophrenic angle.
Extensive ground- glass opacity and consolidation with air bronchograms in the right lower lobe, in a pattern suggestive of aspiration.
A small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is present.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Gallbladder is distended, but without radiopaque stones or CT evidence of cholecystitis.
There are enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, for example, para-aortic node measuring 10 mm in short axis (series 2 image 70).
These lymph nodes are increased since the last examination, probably due to recent esophagectomy.
Stranding in the root of the mesentery may also be related to recent surgery.
No free air or free fluid.
No free air.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesions.
There is diffuse edema in the subcutaneous soft tissues, particularly on the right side.
Their dependent distribution suggests aspiration as an etiology.
Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion.
Small pericardial effusion.
Inflammatory changes in mesentery and prominent lymph nodes, likely due to recent abdominal surgery.
Small right pneumothorax.
There were no diagnostic films obtained.
There is evidence of a pacer wire in the right ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2197-12-11**], the pericardial effusion now appears slightly larger.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: acute renal failure  HISTORY: 62-year-old female status post esophagectomy, complicated by pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure and sepsis.
CT OF THE SINUSES: Visualized paranasal sinuses are normally aerated, with the exception of a small amount of fluid and/or mucosal thickening in the sphenoid sinus and its lateral recesses.
The nasal septum is midline, with a small leftward deviated spur.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of sinusitis.
***** [**2197-12-31**] RUQ ULTRASOUND: RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The gallbladder is markedly distended and contains shadowing stones.
There is no gallbladder wall thickening.
A small amount of pericholecystic fluid is thought more likely related to ascites, which was demonstrated on the recent CT study.
There is no fluid within Morison's pouch.
There is no biliary ductal dilatation.
There is no focal or textural hepatic abnormality.
IMPRESSION: Cholelithiasis but no definite evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Assess for interval change.
There remains dense bilateral multifocal consolidation.
There has been slight interval improvement in the right lower lobe consolidation which still encompasses a large portion of the right lower lobe.
Right upper lobe consolidation is not significantly changed.
There has been slight interval worsening in consolidation in the lingula as well as confluent ground-glass opacity and alveolar consolidation in the lower lobe.
Bilateral pleural effusions remain small but are slightly increased in size.
Small pericardial effusion persists but is slightly decreased in size.
No focal osseous lesions.
Limited noncontrast imaging through the upper abdomen demonstrates no gross abnormalities.
Coronal and sagittal reformatted images confirm the above findings.
IMPRESSION: 1) Persistent dense multifocal consolidation, slightly improved in the right lung, but slightly worsened in the left lung.
2) Slight increase in small bilateral pleural effusions.
3) Slight decrease in small pericardial effusion.
4) Status post esophagectomy, not well evaluated without IV or oral contrast.
***** [**2198-1-4**] CT HEAD: INDICATION: 62-year-old woman status post esophagectomy, now with dilated left pupil.
FINDINGS: Again seen is a hyperdense rounded lesion in the suprasellar region corresponding the prior CT and MR; it appears slightly smaller and more hyperdense than on prior CT, perhaps post-procedural change.
There is no acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or acute territorial infarction.
There has been resolution of the pneumocephalus.
There is an air-fluid level within the right sphenoid air cell, and near total opacification of the posterior ethmoids as well as the left sphenoid air cell.
An air-fluid level is incompletely visualized in the right maxillary sinus and there is incompletely evaluated mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus.
Since the previous study, there has been opacification of bilateral mastoid air cells.
Air-fluid levels in the sphenoid and right maxillary sinus and opacification of several ethmoid air cells, and bilateral mastoid air cells are all suggestive of sinusitis.
Hyperdense rounded suprasellar lesion, which has been previously biopsied, and whose pathology is most consistent with a benign cyst such as a Rathke cleft cyst.
***** [**2198-1-8**] RUQ ULTRASOUND: INDICATION: 62-year-old female with prolonged ICU stay for ARDS presenting with increasing WBC.
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The visualized right hepatic lobe demonstrates normal echotexture without focal mass.
The gallbladder is moderately distended and contains small shadowing stones.
A small amount of pericholecystic fluid is again identified, likely related to ascites and unchanged from the prior study.
Limited views of the right kidney demonstrate no evidence for hydronephrosis.
Cholelithiasis with no definite evidence for acute cholecystitis.
A small amount of pericholecystic fluid is without change and is likely secondary to perihepatic ascites.
On POD 1 she went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and was started on amiodarone drip with diltiazem for rate control.
She also had an episode of hypotension with concurrent ST elevations on EKG, so cardiac enzymes were sent and she was started on Levophed.
On the morning of POD 3 she had an episode of respiratory distress, hypotension, altered mental status, and associated rapid ventricular response after suctioning, so was reintubated.
A post-intubation xray showed patchy opacities in the RML and LLL, concerning for ARDS.
She also became febrile to 102.1, so pancultures were sent and she was started on Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, and Zosyn in addition to Flagyl.
Sputum cultures grew out non-resistant Pseudomonas, and pansensitive enterobacter.
On POD 4 Nephrology was consulted for her rising creatinine and acute renal failure.
however she continued to spike fevers, so all of her lines were changed and cultures were resent.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 86746**] was improving slowly until [**2197-12-20**], when she went back into rapid AFib and was restarted on amiodarone drip.
She had several further episodes of brief asystole/acute bradycardia over the next few days, so a transvenous temporary pacemaker lead was placed by EP on [**12-26**].
She remained relatively stable, requiring constant pressors and ventilation and intermittently in Afib, but her chest xrays continued to show increased infiltrates bilaterally.
On [**1-3**] Mrs. [**Known lastname 86746**] went back into atrial fibrillation with rapid response unresponsive to amio and betablockers, and hypotensive to the 60s-70s.
Her pupils were noted to be unequal on [**1-4**] so a CT head was ordered which showed only sinusitis and the previously visualized suprasellar mass.
Her pO2 began to decrease gradually despite continued aggressive ventilation with [**Last Name (LF) 97798**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was paralyzed in an attempt to prevent vent dyssynchrony.
Zofran 8 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Tablet PO every six (6) hours  as needed for nausea.
