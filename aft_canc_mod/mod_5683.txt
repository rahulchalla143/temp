The pt was in his usual state of health until 2-3 days ago when he noticed increased dyspnea on exertion, and a stomach ache that he noticed yesterday.
Today he was at a bbq at his mother's house and became dyspneic and dizzy while walking up a [**Doctor Last Name **].
When he stopped to relax he noticed some substernal chest pain.
He complained of pleuritic CP and was noted to be in sinus tach to 110, q waves anteriorly.
There was concern for STEMI and pt was given asa 325mg, heparin, atorva 80mg, however per cards did not meet criteria.
CTA chest was done which was prelim negative but did demonstrate small pericardial effusion, small right pleural effusion, bilateral ill-defined lung opacities (Aspiration, edema, hemorrhage)and prominent lymph nodes in the axilla, mediastinum, and hilum.
On the floor the pt was 100% on RA, denied CP, palpitations, SOB, did endorse some pain in the areas of his skin abrasions.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.

Mild blunting of bilateral costophrenic angle suggests trace effusion.
Bilateral ground-glass opacities, as better evaluated on immediately subsequent CT, may be due to aspiration and/or pulmonary edema, although pulmonary hemorrhage or infection is not excluded .
No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Diffuse bilateral ill-defined lung opacities.
Small right pleural effusion.
Ovoid hyperdense material in the esophagus, likely ingested material, appear as tablets on the coronal images.
CT Head ([**5-14**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process .
No angiographically apparent flow limiting epicardial coronary artery diease, but diffuse slow flow consistent with microvascular dysfunction.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Moderate LV and marked RV diastolic heart failure.
Systemic arterial hypotension with mixed venous O2 sat consistent with cardiogenic shock.
No convincing hemodynamic evidence of constritive physiology.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Biventricular (L>>R) concentric hypertrophy with borderline systolic function.
No LVOT obstruction or clinically-significant mitral regurgitation.
Findings are most compatible with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Moderate left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size with poor deformation of the inferior and septal walls on tagged images.
The LVEF was mildly depressed at 48%.
The effective forward LVEF was moderately depressed at 31%.
These findings are consistent with cardiac amyloidosis.
Right ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
[The degree of mitral regurgitation may be significantly OVERestimated.]
The main pulmonary artery diameter index was mildly dilated.
Mild biatrial enlargement.
Brief Hospital Course: Summary: Mr [**Known lastname 76783**] is a 42M with 8pky tob hx, and recent hematochezia who p/w episode of syncope and subsequent VT arrest in ED found to have concentric LVH on Echo.
# VT arrest: Pt presented to the ED after episode of syncope and had subsequent episode of pulseless VT resolved with 2 shocks.
Urgent ECHO showed severe symmetric LVH.
Cath was performed on [**5-15**], which showed no intraventricular gradient, PCW = 21, diffuse slow flow through coronaries c/w  microvascular dysfunction but without flow-limiting lesions, dilated heart, and systemic arterial hypotension with low mixed O2 sat c/w cardiogenic shock.
A formal Echo was obtained, which showed severe, symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy -  amyloidosis or Fabry's disease.
A cardiac MRI was obtained, which showed mildly depressed LVEF at 38% and a pattern of gadolinium enhancement consistent with amyloidosis.
Studies were sent to investigate the cause of the hypertrophy with the SPEP results showing monoclonal IgM lambda and trace free monoclonal Bence-[**Doctor Last Name **] lambda highly suggestive of myeloma.
Syncope was thought to be [**12-28**] arrhythmia as above.
He had recent c-scope with 2 benign polyps.
Disp:*90 Tablet Extended Release 24 hr(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Ventricular tachycardia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were found to have an enlarged heart and a biopsy was done on [**5-17**] to diagnose the reason for the heart thickening and enlargement.
An internal cardiac defibrillator (ICD) was placed as well so that you will get an internal shock if the ventricular tachycardia returns.
No lifting your left arm over your head or lift more than 5 pounds for 6 weeks.
Start taking acetaminophen, tylenol, as needed for the pain in your defibrillator area.
