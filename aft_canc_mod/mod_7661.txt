EGD on [**2102-1-13**] showed a mass in the distal esophagus which was biopsied and is poorly differentiated carcinoma.
Patient was initially referred to GI in early [**Month (only) 956**] for weight loss and new dysphagia.
CT [**1-5**] showed esophageal mass.
EGD on [**1-13**] saw fungating mass in lower esophagus with extrinsic compression.
Nephrology consulted and felt this was likely [**Last Name (un) **] [**12-29**] volume depletion, and though CT scan showed left only hydronephrosis (presumably due to lymphadenopathy) with diffuse abd/pevlis LAD, this was not felt to be related to the bump in creatinine given his presumably normal baseline kidney function.
Patient denied any history of kidney problems (stones) previously.
He was challenged with several liters of IVF with no response.
Put out 50 ccs of urine which looked like ATN per nephrology, so was given Lasix 120 mg IV x 1 [**1-20**] with no response.
Does not appear fluid overloaded on exam.
He denies any pain except for abdominal tenderness to palpation.
Per nursing, had 1 episode of vomiting feculant material, not saved.

Married, lives with wife [**Name (NI) 30512**] and son [**Name (NI) **] tobacco - ex-smoker approx 20 years of smoking history quit [**9-/2101**] ETOH - denies Drugs - denies   Family History: Kidney disease - denies negative for FH of cancer or other chronic diseases  Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM: Vitals - 98, 100/62, 94, 20, 98/RA GENERAL: ill-appearing, somnolent but arousable SKIN: warm and well perfused, no rashes HEENT: AT/NC, EOMI, PERRLA, anicteric sclera, pink conjunctiva, dry MM, no LAD, left HD line site NL and dressing with dry blood.
CARDIAC: irregularly irregular , S1/S2, no mrg LUNG: CTAB except decreased at bases ABDOMEN: mildly distended, decreased bowel sounds, diffuse mild TTP,  no rebound/guarding, no hepatosplenomegaly M/S: moving all extremities well, no cyanosis, or edema PULSES: 2+ DP pulses bilaterally NEURO: CN II-XII intact, sensation, strength intact.
Prominence of the distal thoracic esophagus likely due to neoplasm associated with bilateral supraclavicular and mediastinal lymphadenopathy suggesting metastases.
Bilateral small pleural effusions.
Abdominopelvic lymphadenopathy likely due to metastases.
Moderate left hydronephrosis with no clear visualization of obstructing lesion.
CT Head ([**1-21**]): FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, edema, masses, or mass effect.
The ventricles and sulci are enlarged, consistent with moderate-to-severe involutional changes.
No acute fractures are detected.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology.
Diffuse cerebral atrophy.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 yo M with hx of CAD s/p CABG, Afib previously on coumadin, HLD presents with new diagnosis of metastatic esophageal cancer, ATN on HD, possible bowel obstruction.
# ESOPHAGEAL CANCER - Following admission for his poorly differentiated carcinoma of esophagus, the patient was deemed a non-surgical candidate given the extent of his disease.
His imaging revealed lympadenopathy in the abdomen and pelvis with presumed widepsread disease.
He had acute renal failure necessitating dialysis and fulminant liver failure and biliary obstruction precluding any attempt to administer chemotherapy.
He was transferred to the medical ICU given his tenuous respiratory status and secretion burden, worsening dysphagia with concern for obstruction in the setting of his malignancy, and worsening renal failure.
After a lengthy discussion with the family regarding goals of care, in collaboration with oncology service including OMED attending, consult service and the GI malignancies team (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1852**], it was decided that invasive strategies or aggressive interventions were not desirable.
Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma  Discharge Condition: Expired.
