He was referred to the Interventional Pulmonology service for Pleuroscopy, Biopsy, Evacuation of a Probable Malignant Pleural Effusion, and talc Pleurodesis [**2122-1-9**].
His functional status did not allow for surgical management of his disease previously.
He was being followed serially by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] in the multidisciplinary Thoracic [**Hospital **] clinic and serial imaging revealed a persistent, and possibly enlarging right pleural effusion.
Additionally, the patient was known to have a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the RLL and was s/p VATS/wedge resection of this lesion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] in 1/'[**20**].
After serial pleural cytologic analysis was persistently suspicious for malignancy but no definitive pathologic diagnosis could be rendered, he was referred for pleuroscopy, pleurodesis and biopsy with Dr. [**Name (NI) **].

Initially post-operatively, his chest tube outputs were serosanguinous with no evidence of airleak on suction.
Interval fimls confirmed improved aeration of the right hemithorax after evacuation/pleurodesis of the right chest.
By POD#1, the patient had an symptomatic bout of Afib with a RVR necessitating transfer to the CSRU.
A surface echo revealed no tamponade physiology and a stable peri-cardial effusion.
No significant decrement in EF or wall motion abnormalities were noted on this study as well.
A CT chest done on [**2122-1-12**] revealed a moderate to large hemothorax (as described by Houdsfiled signature of the complex right pleural effusion in the background of bloody chest tube outputs).
He was managed conservatively and no transfusion requirement occured.
Intermittently, the patient had burst of Afib that converted to SR necessitating advancement of his lopressor medication.
Metoprolol Tartrate 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for tachycardia.
