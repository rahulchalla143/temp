She was recently diagnosed with left lung nodule for which she is undergoing w/u and went to see her PCP for this yesterday.
At her PCP she admitted to feeling fatigued, having many black stools, and a 10 lb weight loss and was subsequently sent to the ED.
She denies any abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysphagia, nausea or vomiting.
History of renal transplant [**2140**] in the setting of chronic renal failure of unclear etiology.
History of MVA complicated by multi trauma including pneumothorax and splenectomy in [**2137**].

Left main bronchus mass; currently being worked up-bronch planned for Mon [**11-29**] with internventional pulm   Social History: She lives in [**Location **] with her husband of many years.
She has one brother alive with thyroid disease and one sister alive and well.
Her one daughter with Down's syndrome died of head trauma and she has two daughters who are alive and well, one of whom also has thyroid disease.
Physical Exam: PE: 96.4 111/57 98 44 (documented, breathing at 30 on my exam), 96%RA Gen: NAD, is taking rapid,shallow breaths, but does not appear to be in respiratory distress, she speaks in full sentences without difficulty HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, OP clear Neck: supple, No LAD, no JVD Chest: Right lung clear posteriorly, Left lung w/ absent breath sounds at base, bronchial BS upper post lung field.
No wheezing appreciated Cardiac: irregularly irregular, no m/r/g appreciated ABD: +BS, NTND, no HSM, Ext: WWP, trace edema right LE which is > left (she reports this is chronic in nature x many years and is unchanged), no increased erythema/tenderness/warmth Neuro: AAOx3, moves all 4, 5/5 strength, sensation intact to light touch   Pertinent Results: Pathology: High grade non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma; see note.
The clinical history and positive [**Last Name (un) **] hybridization is consistent with a post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder.
Sections (slides A&B) show a dense infiltrate of cells with marked crush artifact which precludes optimal assessment of morphology in most areas.
There are several areas of necrosis noted.
Scattered cells with prominent nucleoli are seen.
DRC shows scattered dendritic cell meshworks.
[**Last Name (un) **] ([**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] encoded RNA) hybridization studies were positive within a large subset of atypical lymphocytes.
Overall, the morphologic and immunophenotypic findings are consistent with a high grade B cell lymphoma.
Given the patient's history of renal transplant ([**2140**]) and immunosuppressive therapy, this likely represents a post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (monomorphic subtype).
The differential diagnosis includes a high grade diffuse large B cell lymphoma and less likely an atypical Burkitt lymphoma.
The morphologic features (including a monomorphic population of medium-sized cells with 3-5 small, membrane bound nucleoli) of classic Burkitt lymphoma are not seen.
Paraffin sections will be sent for FISH analysis to look for c-myc translocation, and the results reported in an addendum.
Since prior exam, there has been interval increase in opacification of the entire left hemithorax with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lung collapse.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Left- sided rib cage deformity is again noted.
IMPRESSION: Interval increase left lung collpase secondary to known endobronchial lesion, with increased left hemithorax opacification and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
Small right pleural effusion may be present, unchanged.
CXR  [**12-1**]: The left hemithorax is completely opacified due to known lung collapse.
Evaluation of the left lung demonstrates unchanged perihilar and right lower lobe heaviness, which might be attributed to mild volume overload, accompanied by small pleural effusion.
CXR [**12-6**]:Moderately increased opacification of previously minimal right lung base opacity since [**2151-12-4**] may represent enlarged effusion or pneumonia.
No change in complete opacification of the left hemithorax since [**2151-11-3**].
CXR [**12-8**]: In comparison with the study of [**12-6**], there is little change.
Opacification at the right lung base is consistent with pleural fluid and underlying atelectasis or pneumonia.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
The severity of tricuspid regurgitation has increased.
The small pericardial effusion posterior to LV is new.

Her upper GI bleeding resolved after endoscopy and diagnosis of duadenal AVM's.
After rigid bronchoscopy for the lung mass, she remained intubated, developed a post-obstructive PNA and UTI, developed sepsis and required pressors.
She was diagnosed with lymphoma with a poor prognosis.
#Duodenal AVM: The patient presented with mulitiple melanotic bowel movements and fatigue.
She has a known history of GI Bleed secondary to a peptic ulcer.
She was evaluated by GI who performed an EGD on [**2151-11-26**] after her INR had corrected with 2 additional doses of vitamin K.  The EGD showed an AVM in the duodenal bulb but no active bleeding.
After having stable HCT while in MICU-[**Location (un) **], she then was noted to two episodes of slow upper GI bleeding (nasogastric aspirates guiac positive, FOBT negative) while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
# Pulmonary mass: Recently diagnosed and chest CT during recent admission showed soft tissue density within left main bronchus extending into LUL and LLL causing complete LUL collapse and partial LLL collapse.
CXR reveals worsening of left lung collapse.
Given the severity left lung collapse, she remained intubated after rigid bronchoscopy.
She received steroids and three rounds of XRT without resolution of the size of the lung mass or left lung white out.
Finally, pathology then revealed that the tumor was a high grade Non-Hodgkin's B-Cell Lymphoma (EBV+) that was likely post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder.
However, given the severity of her lymphoma and the overall poor health, the oncology team advised that even with aggressive chemotherapy that this patient had a minimal chance of survival.
She remained ventilator dependant and all attempts at weaning were unsucessful due to hypoxia.
# Sepsis: Just prior to her transfer from MICU [**Location (un) 2452**] to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient became septic either from PNA or UTI.
On [**12-7**], she was noted to have upper GI bleeding and received 2 units PRB's.
An echo was obtain to evaluated for pericardial effusion or LV collapse from adjacent lung mass; there were no significant abnormalities to explain hypotension.
It is likely elevated in the setting of free water restriction, hypernatremia,and poor PO intake.
Renal Transplant was also consulted given patients history of renal transplant in [**2140**].
During this time, she had started on prednisone and XRT for the lung mass and was found to have tumor lysis syndrome.
Based on a low urine uric acid/creatinine ratio, the renal transplant team did not believe that she had urate nephropathy.
However, she was given a dose of rasburicase to prevent urate nephropathy.
Her creatinine and urine output then began improving with a high level of dilute urine output consistent with ATN.
# Hypernatremia: Patients Na was elevated on admission.
She does have recent history hyponatremia for which she was being fluid restricted presumably for SIADH in setting of lung mass.
However, as her ATN resolved, she began putting out very dilute urine.
She then became hypernatremic again and required free water administration, which successfully reduced her sodium from 150->144.
# Leukocytosis: WBC was elevated throughout her last hospital stay in [**Month (only) 359**] of this year.
She was afebrile throughout her stay.
The differential showed a mild-moderate neutrophilia, no bands.
It was thought there could be a post-obstructive pneumonia, however given she remained afebrile and asymptomatic, no therapy was indicated.
She then grew enterococcus UTI and Pseudomonas PNA.
Flagyl was added for possible component of anaerobic infection in her lungs.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient was admitted in atrial fibrillation.
She has a CHADS score 3 given hypertension and stroke, thus was on coumadin.
Given elevated INR on admission in setting of active GI bleed, she received 10mg Vitamin K in the ED, and subsquently an additional 10mg to correct her INR for her EGD and bronchoscopy.
# Tumor Lysis Syndrome: After starting prednisone and XRT, her uric acid and phosphate rose and her calcium fell.
She was then given one dose of Rasburicase with significant reduction in uric acid levels.
# Elevated BS: On admission the patient had mildly eleaved blood sugars.
Her sugars were monitored, but no intervention needed.
# Anxiety: Increased in the setting of left lung mass.
