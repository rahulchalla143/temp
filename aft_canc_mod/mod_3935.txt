From the grandson, the patient has had increasing RLE pain times several days, and from the limited info provided by the patient she ran out of the 60 tabs of Percocet also several days ago.
In the ED, the patient was confused and somnolent but in obvious pain, wailing out but unable to give a history.

The patient is rotated but there is probable small linear atelectasis at the left lung base.
IMPRESSION: Mild cardiac failure.
[**2163-4-21**]   CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: There is no sign for the presence of an intracranial hemorrhage.
There are cluster of small (less than 1 cm) hypodense areas near the atrium of the left lateral ventricle.
While nonspecific in etiology, the findings are most commonly secondary to chronic small vessel infarction.
Probable additional chronic small vessel infarction is seen in the right corona radiata.
There is no sign for hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.
The surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures show no overt pathology.
CONCLUSION: No evidence for intracranial hemorrhage.
Probable multiple small chronic infarcts, as noted above.
One of them had stigmata had recent bleeding.
Three 1 cc.Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] injections were applied for hemostasis at the base of the polyp with stigmata of recent bleeding.
[**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully.
Excavated Lesions A single superficial non-bleeding 5mm ulcer was found in the stomach body.
Brief Hospital Course: Impression: 68 yo w/ MMP now with recent GIB from likely polypoid lesions s/p MICU stay, and severe PVD likely needing [**Hospital1 1106**] surgery intervention.
Upper GI bleed The patient has a history of GI bleeding and had a normal EGD in the past several months per report.
During her hospitalization, she had an episode of large volume hematemesis, requiring PRBC support (x6 units) and a MICU transfer.
There she underwent two EGDs which demonstrated normal esophagus and normal duodenum, but showed three polypoid lesions in the stomach, one of which had stigmata of bleeding; she underwent epinephrine injection and cauterization to this area.
She also had a 5mm non bleeding gastric ulcer.
Her HCT was stable after this, and she had no further episodes of hematemesis.
Chronic Pain The patient presented with difficult to control lower extremity pain and a change in mental status on admission.
Acute and chronic pain service consults were obtained, and her mental status cleared on modification of her pain regimen.
Peripheral [**Hospital1 1106**] disease and ulcerations The patient was on [**Hospital1 **] and plavix after a common iliac stent and angioplasty on right tibial artery.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 60470**] is planning for a STSG of her RLE ulcerations in two to three weeks after discharge.
She was briefly on vancomycin given her history of MRSA colonization of her RLE lesions, but this was discontinued prior to discharge as there was no sign of infection.
CAD The patient was continued on a beta blocker, losartan, and a statin; her [**Last Name (STitle) **] was held in the setting of her GI bleed.
She was started on a small dose of lisinopril given her diabetes, though she did not have proteinuria on this admission.
Lactulose 10 g Packet Sig: One (1)  PO once a day as needed for constipation.
