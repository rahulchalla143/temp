[**2155-7-24**]: Rigid bronchoscopy using the Dumon black bronchoscope.
History of Present Illness: 67 year old man who presented to his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 13835**] 6 weeks ago due to malaise.
He has a long history of cough productive of brown-yellow sputum as well as wheezing.
Due to his heavy smoking history, a chest xray was ordered and an abnormality detected therefore he was sent for a CT of the chest.
Rather, he was sent to us for evaluation.
Of note, he also complains of a 20 pound weight loss over the past 4 weeks.
He denies other constitutional symptoms and there are no symptoms suggestive of localized metastatic involvement.
He underwent a flexible bronchoscopy today which revealed a near occlusion of the bronchus intermedius with an endobronchial mass.
Married and lives with his family   Family History: Mother- died of old age in late 80's Father- died of old age in late 80's Siblings- alive and well Offspring- 4 children all well   Physical Exam: VS: 99.0  HR: 80-90 SR  BP: 135/45  Sats: 97% RA General: no apparent distress HEENT: normocephalic, mucus membranes moist Neck: supple no lymphadenopathy Card: RRR Resp: decreased breath sounds GI: benign Extr: warm no edema Neuro: Awake, alert, oriented  Pertinent Results: [**2155-7-25**] WBC-18.0* RBC-4.02* Hgb-9.9* Hct-32.1* MCV-80* MCH-24.7* MCHC-31.0 RDW-15.4 Plt Ct-522* [**2155-7-24**] WBC-25.6* RBC-3.85* Hgb-9.9* Hct-30.6* MCV-80* MCH-25.8* MCHC-32.5 RDW-16.3* Plt Ct-566* [**2155-7-23**] WBC-23.3* RBC-4.42* Hgb-11.2* Hct-34.5* MCV-78* MCH-25.4* MCHC-32.5 RDW-16.5* Plt Ct-552* [**2155-7-23**] Neuts-88.8* Lymphs-7.8* Monos-3.2 Eos-0.1 Baso-0.1 [**2155-7-25**] Glucose-96 UreaN-11 Creat-1.2 Na-138 K-3.7 Cl-101 HCO3-27 [**2155-7-23**] Glucose-103 UreaN-17 Creat-0.9 Na-138 K-4.6 Cl-100 HCO3-28  CXR: [**2155-7-25**] The mass known to protrude into the right main bronchus can be seen on the chest radiograph.
There is no pneumothorax.
[**2155-7-24**] FINDINGS: Reduced volume of the right hemithorax with right basal alveolar opacity that shows central and peripheral consolidation.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
CCT: [**2155-7-23**]: IMPRESSION: 1) Large right lower lobe mass which has an endobronchial component in the bronchus intermedius causing complete collapse of the right lower lobe with narrowing of the right middle lobe bronchus.
2)Pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the subcarinal, right hilar and precarinal regions with enlarged nodes also in the right paratracheal regions extending up to the 2R level.
No contralateral hilar lymph node enlargement.
3)Left adrenal soft tissue mass suspicious for a metastasis.
4)Diffuse right upper and middle lobe nodularity with ground-glass appearance may be related to recent aspiration and does not have a typical appearance for lymphangitis carcinomatosa.
5)Left posterior basal segment moderate bronchiectasis with reticular pattern and fibrosis suggests recurrent aspiration or infection, which is probably unrelated to the right lower lobe process.
Microangiopathic ischemic white matter disease.
Multiple old lacunar infarcts as described above.
No acute intracranial process detected.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 82925**] was admitted on [**7-23**]/of for Right lung mass with extrinsic compression of bronchus intermedius and loculated right pleural effusion.
He had a chest CT & Head MRI.
He underwent flexible bronchosocpy which showed an endobronchial mass that was nearly obstructing the bronchus intermedius but that mass was bypassed with patent distal bronchus intermedius.
On [**2155-7-24**] he was taken to the operating room for Rigid bronchoscopy using the Dumon black bronchoscope.
The preliminary pathology results on the frozen sample of the tumor reveals squamous cell carcinoma.
While in the PACU he had respiratory distress requiring re-intubation.
He was started on IV Zosyn for obstructive pneumonia.
Atrovent HFA 17 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Two (2) puffs Inhalation four times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
