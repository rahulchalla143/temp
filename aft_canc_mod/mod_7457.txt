Brief Hospital Course: 83-year-old man with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, ongoing chemoradiation, presents with altered mental status.
Hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient had been in sinus tachycardia to ~120 since admission despite 2L IVF and 2 units pRBC.

Stat CXR showed diffuse pulmonary edema, and with his concurrent hypertension, he was started on a nitroglycerin drip.
He was sent for CT head given his altered mental status and possibly new anisocoria.
While being transported, he developed bradycardia down to 20, desaturation, and apnea requiring bag ventilation.
On evaluation, there were no palpable pulses and no obtainable blood pressure.
Altered mental status: Cause not entirely clear, but possible contribution from opioids at home, as well as hyponatremia.
He was also treated with levofloxacin for a possible pneumonia, given left basilar opacity, mild hypoxia (93% RA), low grade temps (99.7) and cough.
When the patient became agitated as noted in the events described above, he was treated with 0.5mg IV haloperidol prn (total 1.5mg given) with good effect.
