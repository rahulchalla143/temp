Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Upper endoscopy with cauterization of bleeding esophageal cancer.
IVC filter placement.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 36365**] is a 53 year-old man with history of stage IV esophageal CA, PUD, ESRD with live donor transplant, PE and DVT on lovenox who presents with hematemesis since this morning.
The patient reports that at approximately midnight, he felt nauseous, went to the bathroom, began coughing and then vomited up a toilet bowl full of bright red blood, some clots and food.
There is some question whether this is emesis or sputum with blood.
No prior episodes and no new SOB or leg swelling.
Reports chest wall pain similar to chronic discomfort for which radiation therapy is being administered to palliate his symptoms.
NG lavage not performed due to esophageal stent.
He remained HD stable but concern for potential for worsening of hematemesis.
Of note, he had one episode of coffee ground emesis in the ED on last admission in the setting of heparin bolus for PE.

Apparent mild wall thickening of the descending and sigmoid colon may be due to underdistension.
However, given change in appearance from prior study and mild stranding around the ascending and left colon, a focal/segmental colitis secondary to diverticulitis, or other infectious or ischemic etiologies could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
Increased size of large hepatic metastases, many of which bulge the liver capsule, though there is no sign of capsular rupture.
Two new lesions are also noted.
New small bilateral pleural effusions.
Interval partial resorption of right lower lobe pulmonary emboli.
No significant change in bilateral pulmonary nodules and metastatic lymphadenopathy in the chest.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary a 53 year-old man with history of stage IV esophageal CA (mets to lungs and spine) s/p esophageal stenting, recent PE and DVT on lovenox, ESRD s/p transplant presents with hematemesis due to bleeding at site of esophageal cancer.
# Hematemesis EGD was performed [**10-24**] that showed bleeding at the site of known esophageal mass, which was cauterized to one area.
In addition to the cauterization, he had XRT to his esophageal lesion on the day prior to discharge.
This therapy was completed without complication.
# Esophageal CA Stage IV with distant metastasis.
During this hospitalization, XRT was administered to his esophageal mass in order to stabilize the site and prevent further bleeding.
Prior to discharge, he reported mild abdominal pain and a CT was performed that showed increasing size of liver metastases with stretching of the hepatic capsule.
He was continued on long acting morphine with oxycodone for breakthrough pain.
At time of discharge, his pain was well-controlled on regimen of MS Contin and oxycodone.
# History of Pulmonary Embolism He has recent a diagnosis of DVT and PE and had been on Lovenox.
However, due to his  hematemesis at admission, the Lovenox was held.
GI was consulted and recommended stopping anticoagulation altogether given his high risk of re-bleeding from the esophageal tumor.
# End-stage Renal Disease He is status post living donor transplant and was followed by the renal transplant service.

Pain adequately controlled.
Discharge Instructions: You were hospitalized for treatment of bleeding from your esophagus.
You underwent endoscopy and the bleeding mass was cauterized.
Due to your history of pulmonary embolism (blood clot to the lungs), a filter was placed in one of you veins to prevent blood clots from traveling to your lungs.
Due to the risk of bleeding associated with anticoagulation therapy, we have decided not to treat you with anticoagulation.
Please return to the emergency department or call your doctor if you experience any new or worsening pain, any fever, or any other symptoms that are concerning to you.
