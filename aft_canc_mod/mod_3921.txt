Admission Date:  [**2164-1-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-1-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2115-11-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2291**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath, cough  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 48 y/o Cantonese speaking F with a history of a rt groin synovial sarcoma s/p extensive resection in [**2160**] presenting with shortness-of-breath, cough and right shoulder pain that started 2 weeks ago.
She was in her usual state of health until 2 weeks ago when she developed a persistent cough that continued to progress with subjective low grade fevers and chills at home.
She presented to a physician when her cough continued to persist for more than 1 week and she was started a azithromycin approximately 2 days ago.
This morning, she suddenly felt worse with increased work of breathing and presented to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**].
CXR showed white out of the RLL (ddx collapse, post obstruction pneumonia vs diaphragmatic collapse) w/ a superimposed right pleural effusion/pleural thickening.
Additional findings included a mass in the left mid lung zone and probable lymphadenopathy in a paratracheal distribution all argued in favor of a metastatic process.
CT torso demonstrated large low density metastases in the chest on the right w/ a 13cm x 11cm mass collapsing the right lower lobe and compressing the right atrium, shifting the mediastinum to the left.
A smaller mass was seen on the left.
Findings consistent w/ hepatic and groin mets were also seen.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or changes in bowel habits.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
Family History: Significant for diabetes in her mom  Physical Exam: Admission exam: VS: 97.8; 90; 153/90; 23; 100% on NRB GEN: A&O, NAD, accessory muscle usage HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes dry CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation left, no breath sounds on the right except in apex.
ABD: Soft, nondistended, nontender, no rebound or guarding, normoactive bowel sounds, no palpable masses.
Left abdominal wall hernia without signs of incarceration.
DRE: normal tone, no gross or occult blood Ext: No LE edema, LE warm and well perfused.
There is soft tissue thickening along the right main bronchus.
The mediastinal structures are roughly midline, without apparent volume loss.
There is no left pleural effusion.
Right lower lung zone white out, which might be the result of airway obstruction with post-obstructive pneumonia, collapse (though lack of volume loss argues against this), or paralysis of the right hemidiaphragm.
There is a superimposed right pleural effusion/pleural thickening.
Additional findings of a mass in the left mid lung zone and probable lymphadenopathy in a paratracheal distribution all argue in favor of a metastatic process.
Pulmonary masses concerning for metastasis, large on the right measuring up to 13cm with significant mass effect causing leftward cardiac and mediastinal shift.
Hypodensity within segment III of the liver, new from prior and concerning for focal fatty infiltration versus metastasis.
New poorly defined hypodensities in the kidneys, concerning for metastasis vs. infection.
Large anterior abdominal wall hernia containing small bowel and colon, uncomplicated.
Post surgical changes in the right groin, without definite evidence of local recurrence.
Brief Hospital Course: 48F s/p synovial sarcoma resection, now presenting w/ respiratory distress and radiographic evidence of new right lung mass and liver mass and who passed away from hypoxemia from the lung mass.
# Respiratory distress/lung metastasis: Patient presented with worsening dyspnea and cough, and was found on CXR and CT scan to have large occlusive mass on the right side, most likely metastatic disease from prior known sarcoma.
Discussion with patient and her sister yielded wish to be [**Name (NI) 3225**] without further pursue of treatment for metastatic cancer.
The patient passed away on [**2164-1-8**] from hypoxemia from the underlying lung mass.
