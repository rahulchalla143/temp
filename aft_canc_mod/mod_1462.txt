Admission Date:  [**2108-4-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2108-5-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2039-5-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**] Chief Complaint: anemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: interventional radiology procedures: angiocath thrombectomies.
History of Present Illness: 68 yo M with h/o MDS, thrombocythemia, HTN, COPD and recent GIB was admitted from NH for decreased HCT (HCT was at baseline 22) and leukocytosis.
DVT: Pt has a h/o of DVT and spelic thrombosis.
Cholecystitis: He was noted to have worsening abd pain and elevated LFTs.
RUQ US showed concern for cholecystitis.
He was readmitted tot he 11R floor for anemia (though HCT was stable).
Attg and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his hematologist, felt that he has some degree of slow GIB still.
IVC gram done to assess clot burden and showed that there was clot above the filter and could extend into the hepatic vein entry.
He was continued with an infusion of TPA overnight that was infused through a catheter extending the length of the clot and then was taken back to the IR suite on [**4-20**] and imaging showed that the clot had broken up a little.
On arrival to the MICU he states he is feeling well and that the chest pain was very fleeting - it was only present when he was lying on his stomach and is now completely gone.
Denies any SOB, abd pain, or palpitations.
Influenza A--> "coma" for 21 days ([**2100**]) Pt admitted to [**Hospital1 **] for respiratory distress.
Dignosed w/ influenza or PNA.
RUQ ultrasound showed a hypoechoic pancreas and sludge in the gallbladder.
Incidentally was diagnosed with Anemia and manocytosis so got Bone Marrow Biopsy.
Anemia/ Manocytosis (myelodysplastic syndrome), very difficult blood type match.
on epogen 5. hemochromocytosis or sideroblastic anemia?
COPD "breathing much improved since stopped smoking 9 months ago".
10 Scarlet fever as child.
Physical Exam: 98.1, 155/69, 107, 93% on 2L NC Gen - Alert, no acute distress but then transiently becomes very sleepy and is hard to keep awake, but then will wake up and be conversant.
HEENT - extraocular motions intact, anicteric, mucous membranes dry Neck - no JVD, no cervical lymphadenopathy Chest - slight end exp wheeze CV - Normal S1/S2, RRR, III/IV SEM rad to carotids biaterally Abd - Soft, nontender, mild distended, with normoactive bowel sounds Extr - 4+ bilat perph edema.
2+ DP pulses bilaterally Neuro - Alert and oriented x 3 Skin - No rash   Pertinent Results: Micro: [**2-19**] bcx positive for coag neg staph cdiff neg x1 .
Rads: [**4-19**] IVC gram: clot above the filter [**4-18**] CT abd: PNA vs. small PE's; There is a large clot burden extending from the IVC just proximal to the insertion of the hepatic veins down the IVC through the known IVC filter into the common iliac veins and through the superficial and deep femoral veins bilaterally.
no abscess [**4-17**] RUQ US: No definite evidence of acute cholecystitis.
No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
[**4-17**] CXR: No pneumonia noted.
Left basilar atelectasis.
[**4-22**] CXR: The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged with pulmonary vascular redistribution and small bilateral pleural effusion suggesting an element of fluid overload.
There is subsegmental atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 68 yo m with a h/o MDS, anemia, ETT, recent large GIB, now with large clot burden of DVT extending into the IVC: .
TPA was infused overnight on several occasions but repeat venogram still showed substantial clot.
IR felt there were no further interventions available.
The patient was informed that it may take months for this clot to dissolve and the risk of further progression as well as embolization is very real.
#) SOB/hypoxia: Has some wheezing, crackles and decreased BS at the bases.
O2 sats to high 80s when sleeping on 2 L NC and increased to 4 L NC in the setting of SOB and satting in high 90s.
During previous admssion he required small amounts of nasal cannula oxygen intermittently which was attributed likely secondary to volume overload and atelectasis.
CXR with small b/l pleural effusions and overload and LL atelectasis.
At discharge bicarb was rising to 35 and Cl was decreasing and thus it was felt that contraction alkalosis was developing.
There was also some concern for aspiration given that at times pt was seen to have profuse coughing when drinking thin liquids.
He did not aspirate on a formal speech and swallow eval, but given these episodes were intermittent he was placed on a thickened liquid diet (soft solid) diet with aspiration precautions.
#) Scrotal swelling: likely from poor venous and lymphatic drainage in legs from extensive DVT's.
The patient seemed to have substantial pain with this which was treated with judicious use of lidocaine jelly, miconazole powder, and elevation as possible.
No ECG changes.
No further episodes.
#) Bacteremia: with coag neg strep - 2/4 bottles were positive from [**4-17**].
Likely skin contaminant, but d/c'ed PICC from R arm anyway since it was present when the positive blood cultures were drawn.
TTE and TEE were negative for vegetations.
However, his sputum production increased near the end of the hospitalization and CXR on [**5-3**] demonstrated new LLL pneumonia.
#) Cholethiasis: RUQ ultrasound showed no definite evidence of acute cholecystitis.
No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
No plans for cholecystectomy unless acute gallbladder pathology again.
Pt did continue to complain of intermittent RUQ pain but stated this was not worsening.
#) Anemia/MDS: The patient has myelodysplastic syndrome - from which anemia is the primary manifestation.
Recently had severe GIB which required an SMA angiogram which showed bleeding at the distal ileocolic branches, which underwent successful embolization.
He was transfused several units while in house but was not felt to be actively bleeding as Hct was relatively stable and would drop very slowly after a few days.
#) Essential thrombocythemia - Patient has history of multiple thromboses due to this disorder.
Pt should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] to discuss any possible further treatment.
#) FEN: When pt was intubated for one of the interventional radiology procedures he had some trauma to his teeth.
Afterwards he had some pain and requested a soft diet.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Morphine Sulfate 2-4 mg IV Q3H:PRN Start: [**2108-4-28**] for breakthrough pain after po oxycodone 22.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagsoses: 1)Extensive intra-abdominal and lower extremity venous clot burden with thrombus extending superior to the IVC filter ending just proximal to the drainage of the hepatic veins into the IVC.
2)Extensive lower extremity and scrotal swelling.
3)LLL pneumonia 4)Hypoxia likely [**2-17**] combo of COPD, pneumonia, pulm edema, and PE's.
Discharge Instructions: During this hospitalization you were diagnosed with extensive deep venous thromboses in your legs.
