She had no clonus.
MRI showed a well circumcised extra-axial mass seen along the left frontal lobe.
It has an enhancing dural tear and is consistent with a meningioma.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] had a long discussion with the patient and her parents in regard to the findings and the options of observing or resecting or having x-ray therapy.
He did recommend resection based on the patient's young age and the large size of the tumor, who also had edema and the fact that she was symptomatic.
