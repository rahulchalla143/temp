Admission Date:  [**2175-5-16**]       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2110-8-10**]       Sex:  F  Service:  O-MED  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old lady with locally advanced non-small cell cancer that was initially presented as superior vena cava syndrome more than one year ago and recently diagnosed subsegmental PE who initially presented to the Emergency Department on [**2175-5-16**] with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
She was subsequently found to have a large PE with a tamponade physiology.
Her chronic anticoagulation for a history of superior vena cava syndrome and PE was initially reversed to enable the pericardial placement.
While she was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, she also had a barium swallowing study done to evaluate a questionable small amount of air behind the esophagus on her admission chest computed tomography.
Her stay int he Medical Intensive Care Unit was also notable for episodes of psychosis which were attributable to opioids side effects.
Non-small cell cancer diagnosed in [**2173-1-18**] after the patient presented with superior vena cava syndrome.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Chronic low back pain.
Chronic abdominal pain.
Esophageal strictures; status post dilatation.
In [**2175-1-18**], pancreatic divisum with chronic hyperamylasemia due to macroamylasemia.
Congestive heart failure (with an ejection fraction of 40%).
In general, a pleasant elderly woman sitting up in bed, in no acute distress.
The lungs revealed bilateral basilar crackles.
The back revealed no costovertebral angle tenderness.
No spinal tenderness.
Extremity examination revealed trace edema but warm to touch.
Skin revealed no rashes, and no lesions.
A nonfocal examination.
She continued to require ibuprofen, Tylenol, and occasional oxycodone for her pain around the pericardial window site.
Her hematocrit had slowly been trending down throughout her hospital stay, which was thought most likely secondary to her chronic disease.
Since the patient complained of recurrent dysphagia, she went for another esophageal dilatation.
She was thought to have methemoglobinemia with a methemoglobin level of up to 17, for which she was treated with methylene blue.
However, after methemoglobinemia was resolved with methylene blue she was also noted to have acute mental status changes with the inability to speak.
Since her mental status and neurologic deficits resolved spontaneously, it was thought she had acute metabolic encephalopathy due to analgesics which she received perioperatively.
However, the Neurology Service recommended a lumbar puncture to rule out meningeal carcinomatosis.
The decision was made not to pursue lumbar puncture since the patient was not a candidate for intrathecal chemotherapy.
Cardiac tamponade with pericardial effusion; status post pericardial window placement.
Esophageal stricture; status post dilatation.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
