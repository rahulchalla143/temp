History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a gentleman with the diagnosis of esophageal carcinoma.
As you know, he was noted to have a mass at his esophagogastric junction.

EGD on [**2197-1-4**] demonstrated a 3cm malignant, nodular mass at the GE junction with biopsy consistent with adenocarcinoma, extending beneath squamous epithelium.
Given his renal insufficiency he is not a candidate for cisplatin therapy, however his primary oncologist is considering adding a second [**Doctor Last Name 360**] depending on how he responds to 5-FU 2.

Cardiomegaly and mediastinal enlargment superiorly indicative of mediastinal post-surgical changes or hematoma.
Right chest wall subcutaneous emphysema.
New left retrocardiac atelectasis and/or aspiration and a left mid lung infiltrate that could be a focus of atelectasis and small left pleural effusion are new on today's examination.
No residual carcinoma seen; see note.
b. Twenty-one lymph nodes, no malignancy identified (0/21).
Lymph node, left gastric (Y): One lymph node, no malignancy identified (0/1).
The area is focally re-epithelialized with gastric cardiac-type, and fundic-type epithelium.
A few isolated glands with atypical epithelial cells are seen with other benign-appearing glands in muscularis mucosae, probably representing treatment effect.
No definite carcinoma is seen.

Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2193-2-7**], the degree of mitral regurgitation may have increased.
[**2197-5-24**] UGI swallow study IMPRESSION: Limited study, but no sign of leak or holdup of contrast.
[**2197-5-25**] CXR IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax status post chest tube removal.
