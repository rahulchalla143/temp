[**2168-7-7**] 03:40AM BLOOD ESR-7 [**2168-7-7**] 03:40AM BLOOD CRP-0.5  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 25 year old woman who presented with abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea which resolved and was replaced with tachypnea, dyspnea and hypoxia.
1) Dyspnea/Tachypnea with mild hypoxia: On admission, she appeared to have a high work of breathing but was oxygenating fairly well.
The remaining possibilities included pulmonary edema, PNA, ACS, other lupus or autoimmune manifestations.
An ESR of 7 and a CRP of 0.5 made active autoimmune disease unlikely.
She had received 7L of NS for aggressive resuscitation for perceived hypotension in the ED.
Her CXR and CTA showed evidence of moderate pulmonary edema.
This gentle diuresis rapidly improved her breathing status and she was discharge home with instructions for close follow up with her PCP.
2) Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension appears resolved and was most likely her baseline low normal blood pressure.
3) Abdominal Pain: The rapid onset abdominal pain with non-bloody diarrhea, vomiting and vaginal bleeding (reasonably explained by expected menstruation) is concerning for an acute process (appendicitis, cholecystitis, ovarian torsion, fibroid related pain, [**Last Name (un) **], PID, ectopic pregnancy), although none evident at this time.
Pleurodynia and gastroenteritis also possible/likely but a single episode not consistent with gastroenteritis.
Gynecology was consulted and determined her symptoms were c/w mensural cramps with possible fibroid degeneration.
Original abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea most likely represents viral gastroenteritis.
