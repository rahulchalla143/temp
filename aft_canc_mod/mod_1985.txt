Patient was recently admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 32483**] for PCP pneumonia which he developed in the setting of increasing [**Date range (1) **] symptoms.
Course c/b hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation, transfer to ICU.
During ICU course developed hypotension requiring pressors, occurring in the setting hypersensivity reaction to bactrim, and one episode of hematochezia during anticoagulation for previous PE.
Patient was discharged to [**Hospital6 310**] w/ plans to complete a 28 day course of primaquine and clindamycin (allergy to bactrim, concern for pancreatitis with pentamidine).

His course at [**Hospital1 18**] was complicated by UGIB from PEG/J tube erosion into duodenum, intubation for EGD and fast extubation, probable nonconvulsive seizures.
1) MS change: Initially, the patient's poor mentation was felt to be [**3-2**] resolving infection (asp pna) in the setting of a low threshold for confusion because of his underlying astrocytoma.
Imaging showed that his astrocytoma had not advanced and was not in and of itself the cause for his decreased mental capacity.
The possibility was also raised that there was a contribution to his confused state from the steroids that the patient received on his arrival to [**Name (NI) 2025**] (unclear reason why- possibly initial concern that MS change was [**3-2**] tumor progression?- no explanation in d/c summary).
Patient was evaluated for nonconvulsive seizure disorder by EEG, with prior study [**2145-12-28**] showing subcortical dysfunction but not clear evid of sz activity, first study on this admission [**2146-1-19**] showing cortical and subcortical dysfunction, no clear evid of sz.
A second EEG from this admit on [**1-26**] showed paroxysmal semi-rhythmic epileptiform activity over both frontal regions.
A final EEG during this admit on [**2146-2-3**] showed an area of cortical hypersynchrony likely to be a focus of sz activity, though no such sz activity was observed during the study.
2) Aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis: the patient had at least two likely aspiration events, one prior to his admission to [**Hospital1 2025**] when he was found at [**Hospital1 **] with tube feeds all over his clothing, and a second witnessed event during bronchoscopy at [**Hospital1 2025**].
MRSA from sputum was felt to be likely colonization given recent hospitalizations and rehab stay.
Patient's respiratory failure was felt to be most likely [**3-2**] to pneumonitis or bacterial pneumonia.
Initial series of CXRs showed stable diffuse patchy opacification of the right lung.
Patient was off all antibiotics for three days, then noted to have LLL asp pna vs. pneumonitis on [**2146-2-7**] and so Levaquin and Flagyl were started again on [**2146-2-8**].
3) DVT- neg CTA and LENI's here during previous admission; Fragmin started at [**Hospital1 2025**] was dc'd on admission and pt maintained on prophylactic dose heparin.
Then patient's LLE was noted to be swollen on [**2146-1-23**], so LENIs were done that showed b/l DVTs in superficial and common femoral veins.
He was then transitioned to Lovenox, but both were stopped in the setting of a hct drop shortly thereafter with bleeding from his PEG/J site.
Patient was later noted to have a LUE DVT, but was not anticoagulated for this given his continued slow hct drop and likely continued UGIB bleed.
However, this is unlikely to happen in the near term given his continued GI bleeding and hct drop.
4) Astrocytoma - repeat CT scan [**2146-1-26**] showed a large mass in R temporal lobe extending into R frontal lobe.
No significant change since prior study [**2145-12-29**] with regard to the mass effect on R lateral ventricle; no evid of brainstem compression.
Patient's astrocytoma was not felt to have changed on this admission, and as a result his symptoms were not felt to be directly related to this lesion.
It was felt that his tumor may have lowered his threshold for becoming confused, somnolent, but that either infection or seizures were the cause of his altered mental status.
He then began to have melena, external bleeding from his PEG/J site and received transfusions of 5 U PRBC without adequate HCT increase.
EGD showed bleeding around the PEG/J and a string associated with a clot and fresh blood in the duodenum.
Following the procedure, the patient had an IVC filter placed as he has had a DVT and given his bleeding, anticoagulation was not an option.
He continued to have a dropping HCT after the procedure and was transfused several more units of PRBCs over the remainder of his admission.
He was noted to still have gastrografin-positive residuals on [**2146-2-5**] in the setting.
Patient required a total of 4 units before EGD, 6 units while in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for EGD, then 2 units after back on the floor for a slow hct drop with guaiac positivity.
