Brief Hospital Course: # Shock: The patient presented with hypotension with systolics in the 70s-80s compared to his baseline of 120s-130s in the outpatient setting.
Dopamine was switched to vasopressin given concern for his recurrent ascites.
His shock was thought to be due to a combination of sepsis and intravascular volume depletion [**3-3**] recurrent malignant ascites.
Fluid resuscitation was performed with crystalloid and colloid without success.
# Respiratory failure: The patient developed tachypnea and increased work of breathing on the morning of his expiration while undergoing a CT head.
A CXR did not show any acute intrapulmonary process.
Bilateral LENIs were negative for DVTs.
Most likely etiology was worsening lung function in the setting of extensive RCC lung metastases and worsening metabolic acidoses due to renal failure.
# Acute renal failure: The patient was oliguric on presentation.
A renal ultrasound did not show impaired renal flow.
Etiology was likely secondary to intraarterial volume depletion due to massive 3rd spacing of fluids secondary to ascites.
Urine output did not improve after large volume paracentesis or after fluid resuscitation with crystalloid or colloid.
Patient became increasingly acidemic.
Dialysis was discussed and not considered appropriate given his poor prognosis.
# Metastatic renal cell carcinoma: The patient required 2 large volume paracenteses to manage his malignant ascites.
His pain was managed with a dilaudid PCA.
Patient's outpatient oncologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] and informed of worsening status and the decision was made to not be aggressive with interventions given his worsening prognosis and lack of tumor response to multiple biologic therapies.
