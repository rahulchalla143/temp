There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal septal, anterior and apical akinesis (distal LAD territory).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**11-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Widening of the azygos contour and convexity within the aorticopulmonary window are present, as well as apparent thickening of the posterior wall of the bronchus intermedius on the lateral view and symmetrical narrowing of the lower trachea on the frontal view.
Lungs are clear except for minimal linear atelectasis versus scar at the bases.
Apparent bronchial wall thickening is noted in the lower lungs on the lateral view, and note is also made of small pleural effusions on this projection.
Skeletal structures demonstrate mild scoliosis and degenerative changes in the spine, as well as healed right rib fractures.
Cardiac and mediastinal contours are essentially unchanged although hilar contours are slightly prominent and have previously raised the possibility of lymphadenopathy.
No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal septal, anterior and apical akinesis.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**11-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent with distal LAD ischemia/infarction.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild PA hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-6-24**], no change.
Cell marker analysis demonstrates that 2-4% of cells isolated from this bone marrow express immature antigen, CD34, and myeloid associated antigens CD33 and CD117.
Bone Marrow Biopsy [**2165-7-18**] SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY:  DIAGNOSIS:      Hypercellular marrow for age bone marrow with megakaryocytosis, myeloid predominance and left shift in myeloid lineage  Note:  The findings are consistent with recovering marrow post chemotherapy.
By immunohistochemistry CD34 highlights approximately 2-5% of blasts, while CD117 highlights approximately 10% of blasts and promyelocytes and occasional mast cells.
CD33 staining abundant immature and mature myeloid elements (20%).
Numerous dysplastic (monolobulated) neutrophils with toxic granulations are present.
Blasts exhibit open nuclear chromatin , 1 - 2 prominent nucleoli and scant amount of light-blue cytoplasm.
However, specimen quality appears to be compromised due to poor preservation.
Forms with asymmetric nuclear budding and irregular nuclear contours are noted.
Megakaryocytes are present in increased numbers, abnormal forms are seen including micromegakaryocytes, hypolobated and monolobated forms.
Rare blasts (less than 1%) similar to the ones in the diagnostic marrow are seen on scan.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation and consists of a core biopsy specimen that measures 1.5 cm and length and contains periosteum trabecular bone and bone marrow elements.
Erythroid precursors are normal in number and have normoblastic maturation.
Mild dysplasia seen.
Myeloid elements are increased in number and exhibit left-shifted maturation.
Several small interstitial aggregates comprised of small lymphocytes are present and account for less than 5% of marrow cellularity.
Location: OUTPATIENT   KARYOTYPE: 46,XY[20]  INTERPRETATION: No cytogenetic aberrations were identified in 20 metaphases analyzed from this unstimulated specimen.
This normal result does not exclude a neoplastic proliferation.
Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the standard methods employed.

Admission c/b ICU transfer for afib with RVR in setting of idarubicin treatment and hypotension s/p beta blocker.
This was held on [**6-23**] due to possible cardiac toxicity (see below), but then restarted on [**6-24**] and completed without further event.
He did have sore throat and conjunctivitis as that time which was thought could be viral.
No source of infection was identified, but because of persistent febrile neutropenia, he was started on cefepime, vancomycin, and micafungin.
Patient's fever came down, but on the morning of HD6, he became febrile again to 100.6.
He had been noted to have expanding erythema at a site where his IV had infiltrated, and there was suspicion of cellulitis/phlebitis at that site.
Following chemotherapy, as his counts approached nadir, he developed low grade fevers less than 100 F, but CT chest showed only resolving cryptogenic organising pneumonia.
#Atrial Fibrillation:  On [**6-23**], the patient was transferred to the ICU for afib with RVR, possibly secondary to volume overload vs. anthracycline toxicity vs. electrolyte abnormalities, as well as hypotension, which resulted from attempted rate control with beta blocker.
He was closely monitored for hemodyamic stability through 4 days of idarubicin administration without cardiac events.
# CHF - TTE on [**6-20**] showed EF 40-45% with anterior wall motion dyskinesis.
Given risk of anthracyclin cardiac toxicity, cardiology was consulted and felt that chemo was still necessary at this time, although with increased heart risk.
They also felt that he probably had an MI about 1 month ago.
Pt developed chest pain on [**6-21**], with unchanged EKG and troponin that stayed flat at 0.05.
On exam, he had decreased lung sounds in lower lobes bilaterally.
Following transfer to the floor from the ICU, he had no further problems with dyspnea.
Repeat TTE on [**2165-7-15**] showed an unchanged LVEF and no new abnormalities since pre-chemo.
?s Hct kept trending down with no obvious source of blood loss and no evidence of hemolysis.
There is an expected pancyotpenia [**12-26**] chemo, however twice he had had an abrupt drop that may be in excess of that expected.
Patient denied GI bleeding, but later mentioned that he had had several episodes of black-colored diarrhea that he did not mention to medical staff.
During the [**6-25**] transfusion, patient complained of dyspnea after the first unit of pRBCs and was found to have congestion CXR, consistent with either pulmonary edema or TRALI.
# Diabetes: Blood sugar at outside hospital <700, HgbA1c 11.6%.
Medications on Admission: - lisinopril 20mg PO daily - pravastatin 20mg PO daily (pt does not take this) - erythromycin eye ointment since [**6-18**] for conjunctivitis  Discharge Medications: 1. metoprolol tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute Myeloid Leukemia Atrial Fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
When chemotherapy was started, you developed an abnormal heart rhythm.
