HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 89-year-old man with a history of chronic gastric pain with recent worsening over the last one to two months, who presents with two days of acute abdominal discomfort as well as nausea and vomiting.
The patient denies any melena, no hematemesis, no bright red blood per rectum, no fevers, chills, no unusual foods, no sick contacts, no chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other associated symptoms.
Per the patient and his wife, he has had intermittent abdominal pain over the past few months, but has been able to live in general a normal life as before, with acute worsening of the pain over the past two to three days, with decreased oral intake for about a week prior to admission.
The patient was initially admitted to Surgery on [**9-8**] with a suspicion of small bowel obstruction.
A CT on admission on [**9-8**] showed small bowel fluid-filled loops as well as a question of a splenic flexure obstruction.
A repeat CT at that time showed no significant change, however, the patient also had an episode of coffee-ground emesis and was placed on a nasogastric tube, and the Gastroenterology service was consulted.
Hypertension 2.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease 3.
Atrial fibrillation 4.
Carotid stenosis 6.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy 7.
Peptic ulcer disease 8.
The neck showed no lymphadenopathy, and was supple.
The heart was irregularly irregular, with normal S1 and S2, and no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
His abdomen was soft, nontender, mildly distended, with active bowel sounds.
His extremities showed no edema.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated small bowel dilatation with a large amount of intraluminal fluid, as well as persistent short segment of wall thickening of the transverse colon at the level of the splenic flexure, without significant inflammatory changes.
Gastrointestinal:  Given the findings on the patient's CT, which were felt to be most consistent with either ischemic vs. infectious colitis, the patient was continued on intravenous ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.
The Gastroenterology service was consulted and suggested a nasogastric tube on low intermittent wall suction and rectal tube for decompression, as well as antibiotic therapy.
The patient was planned to undergo a barium enema on [**9-10**], however, further evaluation of the abdominal CT studies obtained on admission demonstrated a small, unable to further characterize, pancreatic mass in the tail of the pancreas adjacent to the area of colonic thickening, as well as a splenic infarct and absence of the splenic vein.
Given these findings, a dedicated pancreatic abdominal CT was obtained, which demonstrated a focal area of soft tissue density adjacent to the splenic flexure on the tail of the pancreas, which could be related to inflammatory process such as diverticulitis or focal pancreatitis.
The CT also demonstrated some improvement in the degree of small bowel dilatation, without obstruction of the splenic flexure, and non-visualization of the splenic vein, likely related to splenic vein thrombosis given the finding of a stable splenic infarct and perisplenic fluid.
The patient had several episodes of pulling out his nasogastric tubes.
A KUB demonstrated continued dilated small bowel loops, however, as the nasogastric tubes did not have significant output on wall suction, the nasogastric tube was discontinued on hospital day four.
The patient remained afebrile and without nausea or vomiting.
The esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed diffuse granularity, erythema and congestion of the mucosa, with no bleeding in the stomach, body and antrum, compatible with gastritis and nasogastric tube trauma, as well as a markedly angulated stomach, suggesting potential extrinsic compression.
The colonoscopy demonstrated an obstructing mass at the splenic flexure, through which the endoscope was not able to pass.
This mass was found to be non-bleeding and causing a partial obstruction.
Multiple non-bleeding diverticula with large openings were also demonstrated in the sigmoid colon and descending colon.
Given the partial nature of the obstruction, he will be allowed to have clears and a trial of clear liquids as tolerated.
The CEA was 1.5, however, the CA-19-9 was 4702, consistent with a pancreatic malignancy or a pancreatic benign adenoma.
Should the patient and the family decide to undergo surgery, likely the pancreatic mass will be resected at that time.
He did voice passive suicidal ideation, however, did not show any signs of active plans.
When ____________ was given, the patient became intensely pruritic and his skin turned erythematous.
The patient remained very sedated from the Benadryl for the rest of the afternoon, however, remained oriented and in stable condition.
