HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60 year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, history of SBL, question of Crohn's disease with an ETOH history who initially presented from the outside hospital with jarring and tearing abdominal pain with radiation to the back and hypotension from 68/30 to 38/palp.
He had an abdominal CT, which revealed subcapsular liver hematoma and was guaiac positive.
The patient was intubated on [**2173-10-21**] and had a liver angiogram, because the CT with contrast revealed multiple liver masses and a cirrhotic liver with the largest mass bleeding.
He grew out gram negative rods consistent with E-coli in his sputum on [**10-22**] and was started on Zosyn and then was changed to Levo.
The patient also had an elevated sodium to a max of 157 on [**10-25**].
Repeat CT on [**10-27**] revealed no abscess, but revealed an interval increase in ascites and multiple liver masses.
Atrial fibrillation.
Question of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  The patient had a colon polypectomy.
Sclera anicteric.
The patient had 2+ pitting edema bilaterally to the knees.
Cirrhosis:  Throughout his hospitalization the patient had elevated transaminases.
Additionally his liver parenchymal was consistent with cirrhosis.
The patient had continued ascites throughout his hospitalization.
Paracentesis was performed and was consistent with a transudate.
During his hospitalization there was concern regarding possible compartment syndrome based on the fact that the patient's ascites would continue to grow.
The patient had decreased urine output.
Hepatology was following and felt that repeated paracentesis was indicated only should the patient have pulmonary compromise.
The patient's cytology and pathology results was consistent with hepatoma.
Given that his disease was so diffuse with multiple hepatic masses and most likely seeding in his abdomen the family decided that they did not want to initiate any chemotherapy at the current time.
The patient had persistent fevers initially.
It was felt secondary to heavy tumor burden and consistent with patient metastatic cancer.
Cardiovascular:  The patient did have episodes of a supraventricular tachycardia, however, remained asymptomatic during these episodes.
He had multiple rule out protocols performed and ruled out for myocardial infarction on repeated occasions.
Acute renal failure:  The patient had acute on chronic worsening of his renal failure, but with hydration his creatinine normalized to the baseline of 1.3.
After having extensive discussions with the wife it was decided that the patient should be made DNR/DNI and then later the patient was made comfort measures only.
This was due to the fact that the patient had widely metastatic carcinoma with mets to the liver and most likely peritoneal seating with an increase in his ascites.
By the time of transfer to the MICU to the General Medicine Floor the patient again had elevated sodiums up to 152.
A hospice bed could not be found given that there was conflict between the facilities available in the area where the patient lived and his type of insurance.
