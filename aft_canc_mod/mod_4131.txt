HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer for which he received radiation in [**2139-1-29**].
He has a history of Stage I A nonsmall cell lung CA diagnosed in [**2139-8-30**] which he underwent a right upper lobectomy in [**2139-10-30**].
He has been followed and has had no evidence of recurrent or metastatic malignancy.
A recent follow-up chest CT demonstrated a 3 cm hypervascular mass at the junction of the left and right lobes of the liver and possibly a 2nd subcapsular-hypervascular mass in the right lobe.
He underwent a liver biopsy on [**2139-10-7**] that demonstrated poorly differentiated malignancy consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma.
On a triphasic CT, a normal sized liver was noted with an ovoid hyperattenuating lesion measuring 3.8 x 3.7 x 3.6 cm in segment 4 of the liver with enhancement pattern typical of hepatocellular carcinoma.
On the posterior-superior aspect of the lesion, there were at least 3 subcentimeter nodular areas of hypoattenuation that was suspicious for local satellite nodules.
The dome of segment 8 of the liver had a 6-7 mm area of subnodular hyperattenuation which showed washout on the delayed phase.
This was suspicious for small lesion.
He was replaced with 2,500 cc of crystalloid and 1,500 cc of albumin.
ALLERGIES:  Patient has no known drug allergies.
He was given a fluid bolus for decreased urine output and Lopressor x1 with excellent effect.
He had decreased agitation after the Haldol, but this reoccurred.
Ativan 1 mg was given with decreased agitation.
A chest x- ray was done that demonstrated central venous catheter in satisfactory position with no evidence of pneumothorax.
It was suspected that the patient had a delirium tremens.
In the SICU, he was confused and agitated at times.
Mental status could not tolerate eating during to agitation and confusion.
On [**12-26**], he had a nutrition consult.
These findings included recommendations to keep the patient NPO and to continue TPN as the patient was demonstrating overt signs and symptoms of aspiration with thin liquids and this was related to the positive poor mental status secondary to delirium tremens.
On his abdominal incision, he had a JP draining serosanguineous output.
He continued to have a cough with scattered rhonchi at the lung bases.
He underwent a duplex ultrasound on [**12-27**] to assess the portal vein and to assess for bile duct dilatation.
This ultrasound of the liver demonstrated slightly echogenic right lobe of the liver and status post left liver lobe resection.
This demonstrated no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
On postop day 7, he had a low grade temperature of 100.6.
It was noted that patient had impaired functional ability and impaired cognition.
On postop day 9, the patient's mental status was slightly improved.
But he still experienced some agitation intermittently.
A urine culture was done that demonstrated E. coli greater than 100,000 colonies pansensitive.
[**2140-12-29**] he became extremely agitated.
On [**12-30**], he seems to be more oriented and more himself, speaking coherent, but often nonsensically.
for abdominal incision erythema.
On [**12-30**], he spiked a temperature at 102.
He continued to have a mild amount of serosanguineous drainage.
Chest x-ray demonstrated improved fluid status versus prior chest x-ray.
No pneumonia or bilateral effusion was noted.
EKG was done that demonstrated a probable multifocal atrial tachycardia with nonspecific ST wave changes.
An abdominal CT was done on [**2141-1-2**] to assess for fluid collection/abscess/bile leak.
The CT demonstrated left hepatectomy, there was evidence of a thin sliver of fluid extending along the surface.
It was noted that there was probably a small subcapsular component along the medial resection margin, a small amount of residual hypoattenuation was noted within the dome of the liver of undetermined significance, and there was persistent portal venous thrombosis identified.
Of note, the patient's mental status became clearer.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Hepatocellular carcinoma, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, delirium tremens, urinary tract infection Escherichia coli treated with Levaquin, abdominal wound cellulitis.
DISPOSITION AND CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Patient was discharged home with family in stable condition tolerating regular diet with supplements, ambulating with supervision, and is status post left hepatectomy on [**2140-12-19**].
