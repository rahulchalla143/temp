Admission Date:  [**2180-1-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2180-2-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2114-3-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo Cantonese-speaking man w/hx of stage IV NSCLC dx [**12-29**] who presented to the ED with acute onset SOB yesterday with exertion.
He was found to have right mainste PE with extension into apical RUL, RML, and RLL segemnt.
Patient triggered on the floor for tachycardia to 150s at 9 PM on the evening of his admission with a stable blood pressure.
He also had an increasing oxgyen requiring ment from 91% on RA on admission to 92% on 4LNC and ultimately to a NRB.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History (per medical record): - presented [**2179-12-21**] with SOB and was found to have stage IV lung cancer with mets to the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia, with pathologic fractures of T2 and T5 and malignant effusion on teh left.
The primary lesion is in the left lung apex with invasion into the anterior chest wall.
- thoracentesis [**2179-12-22**] showed adenocarcinoma with CK7 and TTF-1 positive, consistent with NSCLC.
Other Past Medical History: none   Social History: Home: lives with wife; immigrated from [**Country 651**] 18 years ago Occupation: previously worked in markets EtOH: Denies Drugs: Denies Tobacco: [**11-20**] PPD x 20 years  Family History: Father - died of lung cancer Mother - died of liver cancer  Physical Exam: GEN: elderly male, in respiratory distress, tachypneic, unable to speak in full sentences VS: afebrile, HR 140s a. fib, BP 130 CV: tachycardic, irregular rate, no murmurs, rubs, gallops PULM: increased work of breath, accessory muscle use, crackles at bases bilaterally, ABD: soft, non-tender, non-distended LIMBS: no edema SKIN: no rash  Pertinent Results: ABG 7.44/24/93/19 .
Imaging: CTA [**2180-1-27**] (prelim read): R main PE with extsn into apical RUL, RML, and RLL segments .
Head CT [**2180-1-27**] (prelim): no ICH .
interval development of pulmonary edema with increased left pleural effusion.
Lower extremity ultrasound [**2180-1-28**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the bilateral lower extremities.
CXR [**2180-1-30**]: Increasing parenchymal opacity is seen at the right lung diffusely, particularly in the upper lobe as well as in the left lower and mid lung zones.
The pattern is most consistent with a combination of alveolar and interstitial disease.
There is a left-sided pleural effusion that appears similarly to the prior study.
The heart size is not changed substantially since the prior study and there is no PTX.
IMPRESSION: Worsening airspace disease nonspecific - pneumonia, CHF or ARDS should be considered.
Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications have somewhat decreased, especially in the upper zones.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC admitted with large right mainstem bronchus PE complicated by new onset atrial fibrillation with RVR and respiratory distress.
Patient is known to have large PE and was anticoagulated with lovenox.
CXR demonstrated pulmonary edema likely secondary to fluids and rapid ventricular rate.
ABG demonstrated respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia with PAO2 of 93 on NRB.
Additionally, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted on chest CT to have worsening interstitial disease secondary to malignancy progression.
Ventilator setting were titrated to ARDSnet protocol low tidal volume ventilation.
His hypoxia and acidemia gradually improved.
The patient initially in atrial fibrillation with RVR and was started on a diltiazem drip with resolution of his RVR.
It was thought that his new onset atrial fibrillation was likely secondary to respiratory distress from known pulmonary processes.
As his respiratory status deteriorated, he intermittently converted back to atrial fibrillation with rates in the 150s.
An TTE was done on [**2180-1-28**] to check for heart strain and revealed: mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy LVEF: >55%.
Trivial MR, trace aortic regurg, and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No pericardial effusion.
Septic Shock.
Once intubated, patient developed hypotension with BP 80/60.
the patient subsequently converted to atrial fibrillation with RVR with rates into the 150s and dopamine was stopped.
Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.
Patient was treated for pain with long acting morphine.
Given his persistent hypotension and respiratory failure, it was considered highly unlikely that the patient would survive this hospitalization with maximal medical treatment, and nearly impossible that he could return to his prior level of functionality if he did survive.
