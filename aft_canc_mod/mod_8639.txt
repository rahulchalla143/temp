History of Present Illness: **Pt eloped from hospital prior to discharge** Ms. [**Known lastname 99956**] is a 60 year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer who presents with shortess of breath and findings suspiscious for PE on an outpatient CTA.
No significant change in breathing in the last two days.
No chest pain, PND, orthopnea, lower extremity swelling or palpitations.
Patient went for a previously scheduled out patient CT today and was asked to come to the hospital due to bilat DVT and suspected LLL PE and left basal effusion.
Attending radiologist reviewed film today and ruled out PE and confirmed effusion.
Past Medical History: **Pt eloped from hospital prior to discharge** Metastatic breast cancer involving the peritoneum and bone, s/p lumpectomy, multiple chemo and XRT.
Osteoporosis Osteoarthritis Status post myomectomy for fibroids Status post appendectomy.
I/VI holosystolic murmur at apex.
I/VI midpeaking systolic murmur at RUSB.
Mildly distended.
No palpable masses.
ext - warm, no edema, no palpable cords, negative [**Last Name (un) **] sign neuro - Non focal exam   Pertinent Results: **Pt eloped from hospital prior to discharge** .
- Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global   systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) - Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral   regurgitation is seen.
- The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
- There is no pericardial effusion.
Bilateral lower ext u/s [**2118-9-6**] No evidence of lower extremity DVT.
Overall interval progression of disease with increased abdominopelvic ascites as described above.
Increased confluence of the skeletal metastases involving the axial and appendicular skeleton suggestive of disease progression.
Filling defect in the branches of the left lower lobe pulmonary artery are highly suggestive of pulmonary emboli.
Interval increase in the left basal effusion with passive atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
Large amount of peritoneal ascites.
Diffuse skeletal metastasis involving the axial and the appendicular skeleton, this appears more confluent suggestive of increased tumor burden .
CT HEAD: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Detection of smaller mass lesions is limited due to lack of IV contrast.
Brief Hospital Course: **Pt eloped from hospital prior to discharge** ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 60 year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer, admitted as outpt.
chest imaging was worrisome for PE .
Repeat [**Location (un) 1131**] of PE without definite PE, and lower extremity ultrasound negative for DVT.
Small L pleural effusion was not tapped, as did not appear significant enough to be causing pt's symptoms.
No active therapy while in house.
Small L pleural effusion on CT, did not tap.
# Anemia: Macrocytic anemia with baseline in the mid-30s.
No acute isssues.
# UTI: UA suspicious for UTI on admission.
