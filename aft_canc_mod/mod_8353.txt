This afternoon, noted to be very tachycardic and tachypnic en route to [**Hospital3 2558**] after HD, so EMS brought pt to ED.
In the ED, he was given 750mg iv levofloxacin for possible LLL airspace disease, though progression of metastatic malignancy more likely and CT chest did not show consolidation.
Developed neck pain and found to have C2 pathological fracture, [**11-22**] cytology demonstrated poorly differentiated carcinoma.
Likely non-small cell lung carcinoma, with RML mass and metastasis to the cervical and sacral spine.
The only manifestation of his disease currently is cervical neck pain, s/p pathologic fracture and posterior cervical arthrodesis C1-C3 and palliative XRT.
Left Common Femoral DVT: small non-occlusive, possibly chronic DVT and started on coumadin for a goal INR [**1-7**] in [**1-/2198**]  #.

Most likely, these represent the patient's known bilateral metastatic disease, though it is difficult to exclude an underlying pneumonia at the left base.
There is no significant pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
Left basilar atelectasis is slightly improved.
No pulmonary embolism.
No aortic dissection.
Unchanged appearance of innumerable bilateral spiculated pulmonary nodules, most consistent with metastatic disease.
Unchanged appearance of low-attenuation foci within the liver, which may represent metastatic disease.
Unchanged appearance of multiple osseous metastatic lesions.
CT Head: IMPRESSION: No enhancing mass lesions.
Stable head CT examination relative to [**2198-1-21**] with no acute intracranial process.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 65 yo M with metastatic poorly differentiated CA which likely NSLCA, CHF, DVT, ESRD on HD, recent cauda equina syndrome treated with xrt and dexamethasone discharged [**4-5**] returned [**4-6**] with hypotension, mental status change.
No specific etiology was identified for his deterioration, which was likely multifactorial due to his widely metastatic cancer and multiple medical co-morbitities.
While ongoing discussions with his partner, his two sons, and various members of his extended family about possible disposition plans that would allow him to leave the hospital without returning to an extended care facility were underway, the patient continued to worsen in terms of mental status and respiratory status.
His respitory status particularly worsened, with several likely aspiration events and additionally several episodic oxygen desaturations unrelated to obvious aspiration.
Since he had indicated his wish for hospice care, and the palliative care team was following, he was not intubated for this respiratory distress.
