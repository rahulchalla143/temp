He tolerated [**1-24**] doses with minimal complications.
A CXR was notable for low lung volumes contributing to increased IS and vascular markings.
Multiple attempts were made at intubation without success.
Eventually anesthesia felt they had an oral airway and his sats increased to high 80s with bagging.
The course was also complicated by persistent hypotension requiring dopamine and neosynephrine and continued afib w/ RVR with rates 120s-180s.
He was then taken to the OR for EGD and bronchoscopy.
In the OR, he underwent neck exploration, bronchoscopy, repair of laryngeal laceration and EGD.
Past ONC Hx: Mr. [**Known lastname 2405**] was diagnosed with left renal cell carcinoma approximately 8 years ago.
He was well until approximately [**6-15**], when he developed chest pain and difficulty swallowing with endoscopy revealing oral candidiasis.
Approximately 6 months later, he underwent repeat endoscopy with stomach biopsy showing a lymphoid infiltrate.
The presence of the gastric lymphoid infiltrate lead to a CT scan which revealed a 10 x 10 mm lesion in the gallbladder fundus.
Pathology revealed metastatic clear cell carcinoma involving the gallbladder consistent with metastasis from renal primary.
In [**2-17**], CT abd was notable for enlarging LN near the uncinate process.
Past Medical History: PMH: renal cell carcinoma HTN Anxiety .
Family History: He denies history of cancer in his parents or siblings.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: Impression/Plan: 59 yo M w/ metastatic renal cell carcinoma s/p dose 12/14 of IL-2 at 3pm on [**3-29**] with acute onset of hypoxia and hypotension transferred to unit with respiratory code.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure - Most likely due to pulmonary edema/ capillary leak in the setting of the pt receiving IL-2 and being 3-4L positive.
CT showed multifocal pna and loculated parapneumonic effusion, positive for exudate.
Patient found to have serratia and proteus pneumonia and was treated for 7 days with aztreonam, 7 days of ceftriaxone.
On [**4-12**] his sputum cx showed sparse growth of serratia which was pan-sensitive.
Will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1729**] and thoracics for trach removal.
#Acute Renal Failure: Most likely due to IL-2 +/- Naproxen use or ATN in setting of hypotension.
Hyperglycemia- initially thought to be due to tube feeds and pt was put on lantus and humalog sliding scale.
Klonopin 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO three times a day as needed for anxiety.
