man with a history of COPD, lung cancer s/p lobectomy, MI s/p stenting, diastolic CHF who presented with R hip fracture now POD7 s/p repair who was transferred several times to the MICU for SOB/hypercarbic respiratory failure and eventually developed a high-grade small bowel obstruction for which he was eventually made comfort measures only and extubated.
# Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure / COPD: He was known to have an FEV1 of 26% of expected in [**2145**].
The original differential for his respiratory failure was broad, including PE, PNA, flash pulmonary edema from diastolic heart failure, and a-fib.
PE and pneumonia were ruled-out with a CT-A Chest.
He also did not appear volume overloaded on exam.
Atelectasis and lobectomy may have contributed to SOB but does not explain symptoms alone.
He was weaned off of his BIPAP down to 3L NC for O2 requirement by POD2.
Solumedrol was transitioned to prednisone 40 mg PO the day following his hypercarbic respiratory failure and he was transferred to the medical floor.
He was transferred again to the MICU on the night of [**7-8**] for desaturations following working with the physical therapy team.
He was stabilized in the MICU without intervention and worked with PT here.
He was then transferred back to the MICU given worsening respiratory distress likely [**2-11**] small bowel obstruction (see below) for which he was intubated.
On [**7-12**], given the persistent high-grade bowel obstruction for which the patient and family did not want to pursue further treatment, he was made comfort measures only and extubated terminally on [**7-12**].
#Small Bowel Obstruction On the floor [**7-9**], he was noted to have a markedly distended bowel in the setting of not having a bowel movement for several days.
An abdominal x-ray [**7-9**] and follow-up CT scan of the abdomen [**7-10**] noted marked dilation of the small bowel with a transition point at the RLQ, c/w small bowel obstruction likely due to adhesion.
A follow-up CT abdomen on [**7-12**] found persistent diffuse small bowel dilation w/ transition point in the RLQ.
Surgery recommended operative intervention however his family elected to make him comfort measures only after family meeting regarding goals of care, given his poor overall prognosis and high risk for surgery.
# Mechanical Fall/R Intertrochanteric Hip Fracture: He was transferred from an OSH overnight [**2151-7-3**] to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of his R hip fracture.
CT head [**7-3**] was performed given the concern for an intracranial process, as he hit his head during his fall, but this was unremarkable.
He was admitted to the Medicine service for management of his comorbidities while awaiting surgery.
Orthopedics was following, and they recommended weight bearing of R lower extremity as tolerated, PT, Hct TID, and lovenox for 2 weeks.
His pain was well controlled with standing tylenol, lidoderm patch, oxycodone PRN, and morphine PRN severe pain.
# A-Fib with RVR: CHAD2 = 3.
Due to persistent elevation in his BP, his metoprolol XL was increased to 37.5mg qd.
CXR [**7-6**] and CT-A on [**7-6**] did not show evidence of pulmonary edema in the setting of respiratory failure.
His furosemide was held during the admission due to him not appearing volume overloaded on exam and intermittent Cr elevations.
However, his Cr began to increase, up to 2.1 on [**7-12**], in the setting of increased burden of illness in developing an SBO along with being intubated.
# Coronary artery disease: s/p MI with coronary artery stenting in the [**2129**].
# Leukocytosis: He had a leukocytosis since admission (ranging from 12.9-19.7), but this resolved (WBC 8.7) even in setting of new solumedrol administration by the morning of [**7-7**].
UCx showed no growth.
No other foci of infection were appreciated.
This was likely due to a stress response from breaking his hip from his mechanical fall.
# Macrocytic anemia: His baseline hematocrit was known to be in the high 20s as of [**2151-5-13**].
# Prostate cancer and BPH: Stable.
# Gout: He did not have any acute flares.
His colchicine was held due to his renal issues, but his allopurinol was renally dosed.
# Osteoarthritis: His home celebrex was held in the peri-operative setting for his hip fracture repair.
