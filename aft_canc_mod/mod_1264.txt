female who was referred for a 12.3 X 9 cm pelvic mass seen on CT [**2154-11-25**].
She has a h/o small bowel obstruction in 8/99.
At that time she underwent small bowel resection and was found to have a gastrointestinal stromal tumor of high malignant potential.
She was treated with chemoembolization and radiofrequency ablation.
Past Medical History: PMH: COPD, Bronchitis, SBO, gastrointestinal stroma tumor, gout, portal HTN PSH: Small bowel sarcoma s/p resection (99/01), mastecomy in [**2152**] (pathology benign), partial liver resection [**2150**].
Family History: Brother with pancreatic cancer.
Lungs: scattered expiratory wheezes and distant breath sounds.
CV: RRR, no murmurs.
Abd: soft, NT, suggestion of a mass in the lower abdomen which was difficult to define.
Bimanual and rectovaginal examination revealed a suggestion of a large pelvic mass which again was difficult to define.
This mass seemed to be more anterior and high up in the pelvis.
The rectum was intrinsically normal and there was no cul-de-sac nodularity.
She also experienced three episodes of desaturation to 73%.
Intraoperative findings included a large left adnexal mass with extensive adhesions.
Her pain continued to be controlled with Dilaudid.
Her agitation was felt to be due to post-op delirium with pain medications from surgery and resolved on POD#2 with minimization of narcotics.
Respiratory: The patient had three episodes of acute desaturation during the operation.
She had course breath sounds bilaterally and a chest X-ray performed on POD #1 showed fluid overload she was treated with Lasix.
Cardiovascular: Cardiac enzymes were checked post-operatively due to the intra-operative desaturations and she ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
The patient had 2 episodes of rapid ectopic beats on POD #2; these were asymptomatic and electolytes were wnl.
An echo showed likely normal LV systolic function, trace aortic regurgitation, slightly thickened mitral valve with mild mitral regurgitation and pulmonary artery hypertension.
Renal: The patient had low urine output post-operatively.
She was thought to have acute-on-chronic renal failure, with an FeNa of <1%.
A urine analysis and culture were sent and found to be positive for yeast.
Her foley was D/C'd on POD#5 and the patient experienced nocturia, similar to the symptoms she had prior to the operation.
The patient was found to be slightly jaundiced with elevated LFT's on POD#4.
The LFT elevation was thought to be consistent with a brief hemolytic picture.
By the time of discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating with assistance, voiding spontaneously, passing flatus, and her pain was well-controlled.
Imatinib Mesylate 100 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO QAM (once a day (in the morning)) as needed for sarcoma.
3) Please call your doctor if you experience fever/chills, nausea/vomiting, increasing abdominal pain, or other symptoms that are concerning to you.
