Admission Date:  [**2151-5-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-5-12**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfonamides / Dicloxacillin / Becaplermin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**] Chief Complaint: R shoulder pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: HPI: This is a 87 yo F with MMP including CAD s/p NSTEMI [**1-21**] s/p POBA of LAD, CHF (EF 25-30% on TTE [**3-23**]), critical AS s/p valvuloplasty [**3-23**], atrial fibrillation, s/p PPM for SSS and h/o VT who presents with R shoulder pain and found to have an elevated troponin.
The patient first began to notice R sided shoulder pain this past weekend.
The pain is worse with movement, constant, and is a [**2153-3-20**].
She denies h/o trauma, heavy lifting, and has not had prior similar R shoulder pain.
No PND, no worsening LE edema.
EKG with a-v pacing, widened QRS, ST/T wave abnls but unchanged from prior EKG on [**2151-3-27**].
CXR with tiny R pleural effusion and changes suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension, R shoulder x-ray without dislocation or fractures.
Continued R shoulder pain, but improved from prior.
Otherwise negative for fevers, chills, headache, blurry vision, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, constipation, or focal numbness or weakness.
Does report urinary frequency, but this is chronic for the patient and she attributes this to diuretics.
Past Medical History: - Atrial fibrillation: off coumadin secondary to epistaxis - [**Month/Year (2) **] sinus syndrome: temporary pacer placed during [**11-20**] admission, was to return for permanent [**Month/Year (2) 4448**] placement, which was again deferred during [**1-21**] admission secondary to medical illness.
- CAD s/p NSTEMI in [**1-21**] and [**2-19**] s/p ballooning of LAD - systolic CHF (EF 30%) - HTN - Hyperlipidemia - Chronic venous stasis - Squamous cell carcinoma: right medial calf, s/p excision [**11-20**], positive margins on 1st and 2nd excision attempts, needs XRT to area 6 weeks after the wound heals.
- UTI - rectal ulcers: possibly from constipation and straining - History of C diff colitis - Anemia: from blood loss after GI bleed - Urge incontinence - Depression - Colon adenoma in [**2141**]: last colonoscopy in [**2143**], no polyps - s/p hysterectomy - Hypothyroidism   Social History: Currently living in Chestnut park [**Doctor Last Name **].

EKG - a-v sequential pacing @ 70 bpm, LAD, widened QRS, diffuse ST and T wave changes unchanged from prior on [**2151-3-27**].
CXR - There is no change in cardiomegaly with left ventricular configuration.
There is central pulmonary arterial prominence consistent with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
There is likely a tiny right pleural effusion, although lack of lateral view makes confirmation difficult.
However, no focal airspace consolidation is identified in either lung to cause concern for infectious pneumonia.
There is no change in a left chest dual-lead pacer with intact leads projecting over the right atrium and right ventricle.
The bony thorax is notable only for degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.
This study is limited by lack of external rotation or axillary views.
However, no fracture or dislocation is identified.
There are mild degenerative changes involving the acromioclavicular and glenohumeral joints.
No radiodense foreign body or soft tissue calcification is identified.
TTE [**3-23**] - The left atrium is mildly dilated but quite elongated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.4 cm2).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis due to mitral annular calcification.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Critical aortic stenosis 3.
Successful aortic valvuloplasty   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 87 yo F with h/o CAD s/p NSTEMI [**2149**], afib, systolic CHF, SSS and h/o VT s/p PPM who presents with R shoulder pain and NSTEMI.
Initially with elevated troponin to 0.22, flat CKs.
Pt currently clinically stable denying symptoms of CP although did have episode of assymptomatic hypotension in ED that responded to 500 cc bolus.
Recent cath [**3-23**] revealed 60% mid LAD disease, site of prior POBA.
Developed shoulder/?chest pain a few hours after heparin turned off; ECG still AV paced but with altered precordial axis (lateral leads downgoing) of unclear significance; thus restarted and patient given SL NTG x1.
Patient hypotensive the following day as detailed below; recommend no SLNTG in future.
With hypotensive episode, enzymes further cycled but were relatively flat (troponin in 0.4 range; CKMB decreasing).
P: With known h/o systolic CHF, EF 25-30% on TTE 1 month ago.
Currently appears slightly volume overloaded on exam but not acutely so.
Does have history of critical AS s/p valvuloplasty last month with decrease in peak AV gradients from 70 to 36 mmHg.
Has h/o SSS and VT. No events.
# Hypotension.
Had hypotensive episode to 70's-80's systolic with decreased mental status.
Also cultured and given broad spectrum abx which were discontinued once cultures negative x 48 hours.
Thought to most likely be due to NTG and morphine given ~8 hours previously for concern of chest pain in addition to some degree of hypovolemia with IV lasix diuresis.
#) R shoulder pain - Likely musculoskeletal in etiology given history and physical exam, but can possibly be atypical presenting symptom of ACS.
Tylenol for pain control; PT following.
Shoulder x-rays showed DJD only.
#) Squamous cell carcinoma - of RLE.
#) Hypothyroidism - Continued synthroid.
#) Depression - Continued celexa.
Lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Solution Sig: Thirty (30) mL PO three times a day as needed for constipation.
Ipratropium Bromide 17 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Two (2) Puff Inhalation QID (4 times a day) as needed for shortness of [**Hospital1 1440**] or wheezing.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for wheeze or dyspnea.

Return to the hospital or call your doctor if you have chest pain, shortness of [**Hospital6 1440**], dizziness, shoulder pain, or any new symptoms that you are concerned about.
