Patient's Y-stent was placed [**2163-1-26**] and complicated by cough, copious secretions requiring multiple therapeutic aspirations.
Patient also elicits decreased appetite, 50 lb weight loss (X 6 months) and decreased activity tolerance.
A PET scan in [**6-/2163**] revealed FDG avid soft tissue mass adjacent to right upper resection site with some avid nodes concerning for recurrence of lung cancer.
Per MICU admit note, patient was scheduled for bronchoscopy on [**9-12**] at [**Hospital1 18**] for his increased secretions and mental status changes.
Bronchoscopy showed no complete opacification, right sided secretions and granulations (non-obstructing).
The patient was difficult to arouse after the procedure, with episodic respiratory depression (O2 sat 70%) and required high flow oxygen via non-rebreather mask.
Interventional pulmonary was found copious purulent secretions around the previous stent which was removed but a new stent could not be placed.

RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):       MODERATE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Reports- CXR FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no major change.
No newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
Pre-existing minimal scarring at the left and right lung base are unchanged.
No evidence of pleural effusion.
No evidence of tumor recurrence.
Brief Hospital Course: 67yo male with end stage COPD, tracheobronchomalacia s/p Y-stent, squamous cell carcinoma s/p RUL resection with Cyberknife treatment, s/p flex bronchoscopy admitted for COPD exacerbation.
# Progressive COPD/pseudomonas bronchitis: Given history of worsening somnolence, likely worsening hypercarbia/OSA.
On initial bronchoscopy, patient had copious secretions.
He was also treated for COPD exacerbation with solumedrol --> prednisone and azithromycin.
He went for a exchange of his Y-stent on [**9-14**], however, while the old stent was removed, a new stent was not placed due to purulent secretions.
Pt remained afebrile but with an elevated white count so he was started on Zosyn/Cipro ([**2163-9-15**]) for pseudomonas infection.
# Leukocytosis: Likely secondary to intravenous steroids and ongoing pseudomonas bronchitis.
Patient did not have any diarrhea concerning for C.difficile.
As his anemia is likely due to chronic inflammation/disease, it was not further worked up.
# Chronic respiratory acidosis: Likely chronic, progressive hypercarbia/obstructive sleep apnea in setting of non-compliance with CPAP.
On day of discharge, discussed with patient the utility of CPAP and its role in preventing a similar episode of slow recovery from respiratory depressing medications (bronchoscopy on [**9-12**]).
# Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung with recurrence: Patient to follow-up as outpatient with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] .
# Hypertension: Continued Metoprolol tartrate, quinapril and HCTZ with good blood pressure control .
# Pain (chronic lower back): Continued on Naproxen and Fentanyl patch .
# Gout: Stable.

Patient's pulmonary status at baseline and being treated for infection.
You are currently being treated with antibiotics for a lung infection (pseudomonas).
Your Y-stent will be replaced Ocotber 14 when the infection has resolved.
Also seek medical attention if you develop any new fever/chills, trouble breathing (requiring more than 3L nasal cannula), chest pain, nausea, vomiting or unusual stools.
