On the floor at OSH he developed sinus tach to 140s to 160s and hypotension to 88/59.
Echo was normal w/ EF 50%, CTA chest was negative for dissection and PE.
He was started on vancomycin, clindamycin and ceftriaxone for aspiration pneumonia and vomitting 1.25L of clot/blood, mostly clot.
They did not have a source for sepsis though CXR looked like aspiration.
COPD  Social History: Lives alone, previously lived with Brother  Family History: Multiple family members with GI malignancies  Physical Exam: On admission to the medicine service from ICU: .
General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, slightly injected and pale, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: Supple, JVP not elevated, large neck, JVP undiscernable Lungs: Crackles at bases, coarse breath sounds right upper anterior field, moving air through all lung fields, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: corpulent, Soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis.
2+ pitting edema bilaterally Neuro:  Alert and oriented times three.
Pertinent Results: EGD ([**2187-9-29**]): Impression: Erythema in the lower third of the esophagus Gastric erosion Ulcers in the pylorus (thermal therapy) Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum .
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2187-10-2**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
[**2187-10-1**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 50-55%).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus.
Left ventricular function is mildly hypokinetic, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricle is moderately dilated and at least mildly hypokinetic.
Mild mitral and moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Abdomen is incompletely imaged but notable for mild-to-moderate gastric distention, and mildly distended loops of bowel within the abdomen, which are predominantly large bowel.
Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, probably somewhat worse compared with one day earlier.
Patchy opacity at right base, grossly unchanged.
[**10-11**] Video swallow:  Aspiration with thin and nectar consistencies.
Patient remained intubated with CXR showing with bilateral opacities, concerning for aspiration event.
During his MICU stay, he also had a run of rapid afib with RVR with hypotension.
He was aggressively diuresed prior to extubation given markedly elevated fluid status.
An echo was completed to rule out wall motion abnormalities.
At the time he was saturating 92% on 4L of nasal cannula, thought to be due to his volume overloaded state and component of diastolic heart failure, as well as resolving PNA.
He was maintained on metoprolol for rate control and a recent history of atrial fibrillation in the MICU.
ACE was not started in house because BPs were stable in low 100s, however would consider starting as an outpt if htn and also eval for need for statin therapy given HF.
He was evaluated by psychiatry for an episode of agitation/belligerance which occured while the pt was NPO and not receiving his usual psychiatric medications.
He was seen by speech and swallow, who recommended modified diet due to significant aspiration risk, however after a long discussion with the pt and family, it was decided that the pt was willing to accept the risks associated with taking a full diet.
On [**Year/Month **], pt continued to require oxygen, which is likely due to recurrent aspirations/resolving pna, this should be weaned as tolerated to maintain sats >90%.
He will be seen at the sleep center on [**Year/Month **] given concern for sleep apnea during the admission.
Medications on Admission: Tylenol Chlorpromazine Perphenazine Bactrim   [**Year/Month **] Medications: 1. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID prn as needed for constipation.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check CBC on [**10-19**] to ensure crit is stable, check lipid panel to eval need for statin given heart failure   [**Month/Year (2) **] Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 34004**] Rehab  [**Hospital **] Diagnosis: Peptic Ulcer Disease Hospital Acquired Pneumonia Atrial Fibrillation   [**Hospital **] Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You came to the hospital because you were having bleeding coming from an ulcer in your stomach.
In addition, while you were here, your heart developed an abnormal rhythm called atrial fibrillation.
While in the hospital you were also treated for pneumonia, and you will have to go to your follow-up appointment with your primary doctor to ensure that your pneumonia has resolved.
Take senna one tab by mouth twice per day as needed for constipation 3.
