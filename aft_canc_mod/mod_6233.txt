She was conscious but repeating the same phrase over and over again (in Russian).
She was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] via EMS and upon arrival she had a one-minute GTC (unclear if focal onset) which self-resolved.
No known history of seizures.
She was admitted to neurology in [**2124-10-20**] with two transient episodes of right hand weakness and speech difficulties, thought to be TIAs (she was off coumadin after SDH at that time).

There is mild periventricular hypoattenuation consistent with sequelae of small vessel ischemic disease.
A focal hypodensity in the right internal capsule (2A:13) likely represents a chronic lacunar infarct.
EEG ([**7-18**]) IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous EEG due to the presence of a subclinical seizure at 6:48 a.m. characterized by a run of rhythmic [**4-24**] Hz delta-theta activity seen over the right frontotemporal region lasting for approximately 30 minutes.
In addition, there are frequent independent and synchronous bilateral sharp interical discharges phase reversing at F7/C3/P3 and P4/T4/T6.
This pattern is suggestive of a generalized cortical irritability.
Brief Hospital Course: 84 year old woman with a h/o AF on coumadin, pacemaker, brought to the hospital after she was found by her husband leaning over the edge of her bathtub, repeating herself, consistent with partial seizure.
Initial exam (extubated) showed patient was awake, slow to respond, but with language, sensation and motor exam intact.
CT did not show any evolving infarcts or hemorrhage though she has had an old SDH which may serve as a seizure focus.
Her exam remained reassuring and nonfocal, and a repeat head CT again showed no change in subdural hemorrhage and no new acute process.
Bedside EEG showed generalized periodic epileptiform discharges (GPEDS).
She had no seizures and her EEG was much improved from her ICU EEG with complete resolution of her GPEDs.
However, she did have a subclinical seizure on the early AM of [**7-19**].
Ms. [**Known lastname 82969**] also continued to complain of chronic low back pain, which is [**2-21**] osteoarthritis per her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 12883**].
She had some improvement with her lidocaine patch and jelly (brought in by husband), but occasionally required opioids for pain control.
CARDS: NSTEMI Patient had elevated troponins that increased over the first night of admission, and elevated CK to 200s.
EKG showed some T wave flattening.
She was on nitro drip for short amount of time but had no chest pain.
ECHO the following day showed no focal wall motion abnormalities, stable pulmonary HTN, 2+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] and an EF of 60%.
She otherwise was afebrile during her hospital course.
Respiratory: Ms. [**Known lastname 82969**] was intubated in the ED after having been witnessed to have a seizure and was quickly extubated.
A repeat CXR seemed c/w b/l pleural effusions and she was diuresed with an extra dose of lasix, which improved her symptoms.
She did have some hypokalemia and was restarted on her home potassium repletion on HD#3.

Urinary tract infection   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted initially because you were found with decreased responsiveness and later observed to have a seizure.
Currently, it is unclear why you had a seizure, but most likely related to either your previous subdural bleed or possible history of previous TIAs in the past (unable to further characterize due to inability to get MRI) with your concurrent UTI likely lowering your seizure threshold.
You were also found to have "demand ischemia" of your heart, meaning that because of your seizure you had some mild injury to your heart.
However, in discussion with your cardiologist and PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] discontinued your coumadin because of a concern that if you had a seizure you might have a severe bleed in your head should you fall.
You will need to have a cardiac stress test as an outpatient in order to evaluate the function of your heart.
You have been treated for a urinary tract infection during your admission.
