Biopsy of right atrial mass in the free wall, suspected lipoma [**2155-8-29**] AICD   History of Present Illness: 76 yo M with hyperlipidemia s/p NSTEMI after initial presentation to [**Hospital **] hospital on [**2155-8-9**].
He had been given Plavix and was awaiting a "washout" pre-operatively, but was then noted to have progressively longer runs of ventricular tachycardia.
He also reportedly had no hemodynamic or neurologic compromise at the time.

Left ICA stenosis <40%  [**8-22**] Echo: Prebypass: A mass is seen in the wall of the right atrium.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesia of the apex, apical and mid portions of the inferior and inferoseptal walls.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Mild mitral regurgitation persists.
DIAGNOSIS:  Right atrial mass: Mature adipose tissue with entrapped cardiac myocytes consistent with lipoma.

He had a chest CT with contrast to evaluate dilated aortic root.
He underwent plavix washout over the next few days and subsequently went into acute renal failure over the wkd.
Carotid ultrasound revealed <40% stenosis bilaterally.
Recommendations were made, wound healed and there were no further complications of this.
He developed a phlebitis which was treated with ancef.
The patient did go to the OR with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**8-22**] for CABG x 4 and biopsy of left atrial mass (which would prove to be lipoma on pathology).
On the morning of POD 1 he developed pulseless VT requiring cardioversion.
The right lower extremity was found to be swollen and cool with dopplerable pulses.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
