As per his report she had a LEFT gaze deviation with LEFT facial twitching and her head was turned to the LEFT.
She did not receive any ativan or PHT during her transfer.
She had a LEFT gaze deviation with LEFT facial twitching and her head was turned to the LEFT.
Her arms and legs were not showing tonic/ clonic activity.
?Her oncological problem began in [**2104**] when she palpated a mass in her left breast.
Her lung cancer symptoms occurred when she developed a dizzy spell on [**2133-4-16**].
A head CT at [**Hospital3 **] showed a right frontal metastasis.
Visual fields and EOM's are full without nystagmus.
There is no drift.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: Her oncological problem began in [**2104**] when she palpated a mass in her left breast.
Her lung cancer symptoms occurred when she developed a dizzy spell on [**2133-4-16**].
Full body imaging revealed a large RUL nodule with many satellite nodules, as well as possible T11 bony involvement.
FNA of the dominant lung nodule was TTF-1 positive, mammoglobin and GCDFP-15 negative, most consistent with a lung adenocarcinoma.
A head CT at [**Hospital1 4259**] showed a right frontal metastasis.
[**2133-7-9**]: Received CyberKnife x 1 to right frontal lobe lesion.
Other Past Medical History: HTN Hyperlipidemia +stress [**2128-1-5**] GERD Thyroidectomy Bilateral mastectomy for breast ca Bladder fulguration Shoulder hemiarthroplasty CAD w/ 1 vessel disease s/p DES ([**2129**])  Social History:  She lives by herself and has a son who lives in MA.
She has no history of smoking or alcohol.
Family History: Maternal aunt had "eye cancer", father had Type II diabetes and prostate ca at older age.
Mother who had a myocardial infarction in her 50s  Physical Exam: PE:  BPs 187/76, 112 pm On vent, CMV mode breathing at 18RR POSTICTAL.
HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa Neck: supple, no carotid or vertebral bruit Back: No point tenderness or erythema CV: Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally Abd: Soft, nontender, non-distended.
No masses or megalies.
Ext: no edema, no DVT data.
No bobbing or Roving.
No facial asym.
Right frontal mass with slightly increased vasogenic edema and mass effect when compared to the most recent MR. 2.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST ON [**2134-1-11**] IMPRESSION: Interval enlargement of lytic osseous metastases, specifically within the T6 and T11 vertebral bodies.
Otherwise, essentially stable appearance of extensive metastatic disease with extensive pulmonary nodules, a right-sided infrahilar pulmonary mass, several hypodensities within the spleen and irregular nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland.
EEG ON [**2134-1-12**]: IMPRESSION: This is a mildly abnormal routine EEG in the waking and drowsy states due to mild right hemisphere slowing most notably in the central regions and particularly during drowsiness.
There were no epileptiform features on this recording.
New punctate focus of enhancement in the left frontal lobe as described above suggestive of a new metastatic focus.
There is a new punctate focus of enhancement in the left frontal lobe adjacent to the genu of the corpus collosum seen only on the MPRAGE images ( series 1101 image 39; series 1100 image 54).
Minimal interval increase in size and surrounding vasogenic edema involving the right frontal lobe enhancing lesion when compared with the previous examination of [**2133-12-9**].
Limited post-contrast only imaging of the total spine demonstrating probable acute mild pathologic fractures of the T11 and T6 vertebral bodies.
Multiple T1 post-contrast hyperintense lesions which likely represent benign hemangiomas.
Probable osseous metastasis at T2 and C4.
No cord compression.
Female w/ CAD s/p DES, NSCLC [**3-/2133**] w/ right frontal mets s/p cyber knife SRS [**2133-7-9**] presented initially to the SICU on [**1-8**] with seizures.
Found to have right frontal mass with increase edema and new bony mets to the spine, transfer to OMED for further therapy.
#Seizure/brain Mets: Pt s/p cyberknife to right frontal lobe lesion on 8/[**2132**].
She also received systemic treatment for NSCLC in Gemzar last dose in [**2133-11-20**].
Now with seizures likely due mass on frontal lobe.
CT showed increased vasogenic edema and mass effect when compared to the most recent [**Year (4 digits) 4338**] which could mean recurrence of mass vs. necrosis of the tumor.
For now her neurologic symptoms have overall improved.
# NSCLC: Pt with stable pulmonary nodules, but with increase in spinal lytic lessions.
She also has several hypodensities within the spleen and irregular nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland.
#Metastatic spinal lessions: CT scan of torso showed interval enlargement of lytic osseous metastases, specifically within the T6 and T11 vertebral bodies.
Pt denies having any back pain and has no neurologic findings suggestive of cord compression.
It showed "stable pathologic compression deformities at T6 and T11.
Probable osseous metastasis at T2 and C4.
No cord compression."
# Hypothyroidism: continued levothyroxine.
