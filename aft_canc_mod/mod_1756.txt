She then had a significant recurrence in [**2125-7-13**] with a near total resection of the left temporal lobe [**Year (4 digits) **] on [**2125-8-31**].
Two weeks after completion of involved field radiation, the patient had suffered worsening mental status.
MRI revealed tumor progression.
However, she had suffered a bowel perforation while on Avastin (one of the known complications of Avastin).
The patient then went on to develop progressive HA's, aphasia, and gait instability which is consistent with hydrocephalus.
Past Medical History: Seasonal Allergies Migraine Headache GERD s/p lt craniotomy for mass([**Hospital **])   Social History: She lives with family and 3 children (ages 9, 6, and 2 [**12-14**] yrs old).
Her paternal grandfather had brain cancer (?type) and died at the age of 60.
Her maternal grandfather had renal cell cancer.
dysarthria or paraphasic errors and word finding difficulty.
No abnormal movements, tremors.

Since [**Month (only) **] of [**2124**], there has been an interval decrease in size of a left sided subdural hypodense fluid collection, with resolution of pneumoperitoneum.
The underlying cerebral convexity demonstrates multiple foci of high-density material, which likely represent calcification and post-op changes in the dura.
The parenchyma in  the left temporal lobe is somwhat heterogeneous in appearance and recurrent tumor in this region is likely present given the findings on prior MRI.
There is no acute hemorrhage.
There is no associated mass effect to suggest edema.
There is no new bony abnormality.
Right mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses (where visualized) are well aerated.
Post-surgical changes of the left temporal lobe following mass resection.
Evaluation for recurrent disease is limited on this noncontrast exam and correlation with MRI is advised to further assess.
No new intracranial hemorrhage.
Chest X-ray [**3-7**]: CLINICAL HISTORY: 44-year-old woman with altered mental status, on chemotherapy for brain mass.
Low lung volumes limit evaluation.
Areas of plate-like atelectases are seen at the lung bases bilaterally.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
There is no evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
No free air is seen below the diaphragm.
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar plate-like atelectasis, without evidence of pneumonia.
Diffusion images were also reviewed.
FINDINGS: Surgical changes from a left frontal/parietal/temporal craniotomy are again noted.
New from previous examinations is nodular diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement, concerning for spread of neoplasm on the leptomeninges.
Also, new from previous MR examinations is hydrocephalus presumably related to the aforementioned finding.
Post-contrast images were also notable for area of solid tumor enhancement, similar to that seen on examination from [**2125-12-18**], including the left temporal lobe and left insula.
Unchanged from the most recent CT exam is a thin rim of extra-axial fluid along the left cerebral hemispheres.
IMPRESSION: Similar appearance to enhancing tumor on the left as detailed above, and new leptomeningeal enhancement and hydrocephalus, concerning for neoplastic spread.
No evidence of acute hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 3646**] was admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 29259**] service on [**3-6**] with new hydrocephalus.
Pt had an EVD placed.
Given abdominal wound dehiscence, the patient underwent ventriculo-pleural shunt placement on [**2126-3-15**].
Serial head CTs revealed no evidence of ventricular dilatation or ICH.
After detailed discussion with the family, the patient was discharged home with hospice care..  By the time of discharge, the patient had regained her pre-hospitalization neurologic examination.
