He says that he still had abdominal pain on discharge, but over the last day he also developed nausea and vomitted 3 times, prompting his return to the ED.
He denies any melena or hematochezia.
No fevers, chills, SOB, cough, urinary frequency or dysuria.
He has had decreased appetite with occasional N/V for the last month or so, and per report, has had a 40 pound weight loss since [**12-28**].
He has intermittent band-like abdominal pain and takes dilaudid/percocet PRN.
In the ED the patient appeared comfortable, with a mildly tender abdomen.
A KUB showed dilated small bowel loops improved since last KUB.
Surgery did not feel the patient had a surgical abdomen.
A UA showed ketonuria and glucosuria.

Dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels, which is concerning for small bowel obstruction, possibly.
EKG [**8-7**]:  NSR at 75 bpm, Q waves in the inferolateral leads suggestive of old inferolateral MI, unchanged.
T wave flattening in lateral leads, likely related to globally decreased amplitude when compared to prior.
Otherwise, no diagnostic change.
CT chest/abd/pelvis - [**2113-8-18**] IMPRESSION: 1) Mechanical small bowel obstruction involving the stomach, afferent loop leading from the hepaticojejunostomy, and the proximal small bowel with a transition point in the right mid abdomen, and new pneumobilia, likely related to the small bowel obstruction.
2) Essentially unchanged bulky lymphadenopathy in the periportal, periaortic, and mesenteric regions.
3) Decreased conspicuity of multiple hepatic metastatic foci.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 yo M with h/o metastatic pancreatic cancer (dx [**2113-1-2**]) s/p Whipple procedure, COPD, and HTN who presented with N/V and abdominal pain after discharge on [**8-10**] s/p treatment of SBO admitted for management of DKA and continued decreased PO intake at home.
He was not transfered out of the hospital due to inability to find placement that the family was ammenable to.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1) DKA:  Anion gap elevated at 21 on transfer, ketones in the urine.
In terms of etiology, cultures sent, CXR obtained, though patient without localizing signs of infection and WBC actually lower than usual, afebrile.
Patient has had minimal po intake so home dose of glargine was decreased to 6U and patient was maintained on regular insulin sliding scale for glucose control.
Anion gap remained closed and symptoms improved over course of admission.
On the floor pt continued to have hiccups and was started on decadron.
2) N/V/Abdominal Pain:  Likely related to DKA in part, however patient with extensive intra-abdominal procedures and recent hospitalization for small bowel obstruction (SBO).
For now, abdomen doesn't appear surgical, and AXR demonstrates some improvement in bowel distention although still evidence of dilated loops of small bowel.
Serial abdominal exams did not reveal any evidence of further obstruction.
Patient was tolerating clear liquids while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with no further abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting.
Decardron was started which did not improve symptoms much.
Morphine concentrated elixer was tolerated and reduced pain.
3) Hyponatremia: Hypo-osmolar, likely related to mild volume depletion in setting of DKA with possible component of SAIDH.
Admission CXR showed mild initial CHF so reluctant to give significant amounts IVF during his stay.
There was no indication of progressive hyponatremia.
4) Pancreatic Cancer: Increase in abdominal LAD on recent CT scan.
Patient's O2 saturations were maintained in the high 90's on room air during his stay with no respiratory problems.
6) Depression:  Possibly contributing to his weight loss and lack of appetite.
7) Decreased appetite:  Likely cancer related but admitted with N/V from DKA/SBO that seem to have exacerbated his lack of appetite.
[**First Name (STitle) 216**] we would not place one for nutritional purposes alone.
Fluids were maintained until the last day of his life when he became anuric and pulmonary edema was a concern.
Lipram(pancreatic enzymes) CR20 Insulin Lantus 12 Q AM/ humalog scale   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Pancreatic Cancer s/p Whipple - cause of patient's eventual death in the hospital.
