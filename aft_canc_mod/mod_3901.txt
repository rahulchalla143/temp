[**Hospital 923**] Medical Epic Biocor tissue valve), Coronary artery bypass grafting x 1 with reverse saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 41323**] is an 84 year-old woman with history of atrial fibrillation (not anticoagulated), aortic stenosis, CHF, COPD, and pulmonary hypertension.
For the past several months she has been having increasing symptoms of dyspnea on exertion.
In [**4-30**], she was admitted to [**Hospital3 2737**] with a CHF exacerbation in the context of an infection (pt unsure of nature of infection).
Although she was previously able to ambulate through the grocery store without difficulty, her current baseline respiratory status is notable for dyspnea on exertion half-way across a room in her home, causing her to sit down and rest.
Because her symptoms were thought to be in large part secondary to her AS and limiting her ADLs, she was referred for catheterization in anticipation of possible AVR.
She denies any recent chest pain, light-headedness, or syncope.
She was taken for cath on [**7-10**] demonstrating an 80% ostial RCA lesion and valve area 0.5 cm2.
After the case the patient developed bleeding from groin with hypotension 60s systolic, HR 40s - received fluids and atropine.
Past Medical History: Meniere's disease Leukemia in [**2097**] treated with Chemotherapy Myelodysplastic syndrome COPD Paroxsymal Atrial Fibrillation - She did not know of this diagnosis.
Aortic Stenosis with valve area 0.7 cm2 Pulmonary Hypertension Hemorrhoidectomy Tonsillectomy Appendectomy GERD Chronic Diarrhea Frequent Urination Previous UTI's Degenerative Disc Disease  Social History: Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 55821**] alone in [**Location (un) 2498**] MA.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right atrial and right ventricular filling pressures with mean RA pressure of 6 mmHg and end-diastolic RV pressure of 5 mmHg.
There was mild pulmonary arterial hypertension with mean PA pressure of 26 mmHg and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance of 150 dynes-sec/cm5.
The left ventricular filling pressure was slightly elevated with mean PCW pressure of 17 mmHg.
There was no evidence of mitral stenosis.
Severe aortic stenosis was present, with a peak aortic gradient of 66 mmHg, mean gradient of 49 mmHg, and estimated aortic valve area of 0.59 cm2.
There was no evidence of a left-to-right shunt based on oxygen saturation data.
[**2115-7-11**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA stenosis <40% EKG: sinus at 75 bpm, NL axis, 1st degree AV block, no ST-T wave changes [**2115-7-15**] ECHO: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**11-23**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post_Bypass: Patient on infusion of epinephrine 0.04 mcg/kg/min, mild RV and global LV hypokinesis.
There is a bioprosthesis in the native aortic position with stable and well functioning leaflets.
There is minimal MR.   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 41323**] is an 84 year-old woman with aortic stenosis, recent admission to outside hospital for CHF/flash pulmonary edema with subsequent ongoing shortness of breath, now s/p catheterization on [**7-10**] demonstrating 90% ostial RCA lesion and [**Location (un) 109**] 0.5cm2.
As mentioned in the HPI, she was hypotensive with bleeding post-cath requiring fluids and atropine.
CT abdomen done en route to the CCU did not show any signs of retroperitoneal bleeding.
Post-operatively she required large amount of fluid resuscitation, transfusion, and pressors for bleeding and hypotension.
Meclizine 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for dizziness.
Ipratropium-Albuterol 18-103 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Two (2) Puff Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
