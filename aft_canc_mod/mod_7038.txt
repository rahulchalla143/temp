She initially denied any fevers/chills, but did report nausea without vomiting.
Of note patient has history of pansensitive E.Coli UTI dating back to [**11/2184**] per OMR notes.
Urology workup from same timeframe included CT pelvis that showed tiny stone in the left ureterovesical junction causing mild left pelviectasis and delayed excretion from the left kidney.
HCT 28 / elevated from baseline , and Cr 1.6 (recent baseline fluctuates between 1.3-1.8).
She spiked fevers in ED to 104F range and given 650mg Tylenol and 400mg ibuprofen,a right IJ placed for access.
After CT Abd/Pelvis revealed [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 5692**] [**Location (un) 1131**] of hydronephrosis, hydroureter and 0.4 mm left UVJ ureteral stone.
Urology was consulted and considered placing a stent, but anesthesia felt uncomfrotable intubating her and it was decided to proceed with IR.
The patient subsequently became hypotensive with SBP high 70's and was started on levophed 0.06mcg/kg/min.
Also given unit of platelets, 2 unit PRBCs and 2 units cryoprecipitate in setting of bleeding from IJ site and worse DIC labs.
A sample of pus from stent was sent off for culture.
A thrombin dressing was packed tightly over RIJ with limited evidence of oozing BRB.
-lumbar spinal stenosis.
She has no grandchildren.

EKG: rate 64, NSR, incomplete LBBB, no ST elevations/depressions, slight left axis .
Echo [**2185-6-6**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened (sclerotic) but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.

There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-11-16**], no change.
Interval development of bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions with subjacent atelectatic changes.
No focal fluid collections are seen.
Decompression of left pelvicaliceal system after placement of percutaneous nephrostomy tube with dislodged left UVJ calculus into the distal left ureter.
Diffuse subcutaneous soft tissue edema reflecting anasarca.
FINDINGS: Mild cardiomegaly.
New bilateral diffuse interstitial opacities with basilar predominance.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are new.
IMPRESSION: New interstitial edema and small pleural effusions.
No complication.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is a 72 yo W with PMH of Type II DM, MDS, B-thalassemia trait who is called out of the MICU after resolution of septic shock [**3-15**] pyelonephritis from obstructive nephrolithiasis, now s/p stent and nephrostomy tube placement.
1. septic shock secondary to obstructive nephrolithiasis:  Pt was admitted with septic shock from urosepsis from obstructive pyelonephritis.
She is now status post IR nephrostomy placement which was complicated by worse shortness of breath prior to procedure so patient was intubated in IR suite.
Urine grew out pan sensitive Ecoli and Blood from A-line grew out GPCs.
Pt had RIJ removed due to concern for line infection and LIJ was placed under sterile conditions.
After replacement of the [**Name (NI) 14938**], pt was able to be weaned from pressors and started having increased UOP from nephrostomy and foley.
Patient will follow up with urology as an outpatient for definitive treatment.
Afib with RVR: likely related to acute illness & volume overload and pt was loaded with Amiodarone over wkd and went back into sinus.
During SBT on [**6-7**], pt developed AF and after discussion with primary cardiologist, started on oral load of Amiodarone with plan for titration in 2wks, overall goal for rhythm control and avoid risks of anti-coag.
Pt developped respiratory distress while in the IR suite when she became tachypneic and had decreased oxygen saturations which were likely due to fluid overload as patient has known dCHF and had received 4L IVFs, 6 Units FFP.
Despite meeting diuresis goals of -1 to -1.5 L/day, the patient remained subjectively dyspneic with signs of volume overload on exam.
CXR on [**6-10**] showed new interstitial edema and small pleural effusions, so she was diuresed further on morning of discharge with improvement in symptoms.
ARF: Presented with acute renal failure secondary to hydronephrosis and severe septic shock.
Anemia / MDS: Pt with longstanding history of transfusion requiring MDS with anemia.
Asthma: Pt with history of asthma who was intubated for tachypnea and volume overload.
There is still some evidence of cardiac vs asthmatic wheeze.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 **]-Combridge  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: septic shock with DIC obstructive nephrolithiasis with hydronephrosis e. coli urinary tract infection  Secondary Diagnoses: MDS type II DM   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital with left sided back pain and were found to have a kidney stone blocking the outflow of urine and causing a severe infection.
You were monitored in the intensive care unit, initially requiring medications to help maintain your blood pressure and a breathing tube.
While you were sick, you developed a heart arrhythmia called atrial fibrillation and you were started on amiodarone to help the rhythm return to normal.
You will eventually need to have the kidney stone surgical removed.
