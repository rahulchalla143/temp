I last saw him on [**2149-11-17**] and his head CT showed growth of the left sphenoid meningioma.
[**Name (NI) **] does not have headache, nausea, vomiting, urinary incontinence, or fall.
His neurological problem began on [**2142-6-22**] when he became confused and disoriented in a hotel bathroom.
At that time, he was visiting his daughter for a wedding.
He had a cardiac pacemaker placement due to irregular heart rate and bradycardia.
Past Medical History: Cardiac arrhythmia as noted above, has a pacemaker in place, prostate cancer with prostatectomy, and hypertension.
His extremities do not show clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
There is no nystagmus.
Motor Examination:  He does not have a drift.
He does not have a Romberg.
Likely meningioma along the greater [**Doctor First Name 362**] of the left sphenoid bone, measuring 18 mm in diameter, unchanged since the most recent study of [**11/2149**], with reactive bony changes, as above.
Bifrontal cortical atrophy, which has progressed slightly over the series of studies since the earliest studies of [**2142**].
[**2-25**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: Expected post-operative changes with the left frontal craniotomy including subcutaneous air and soft tissue swelling, moderate pneumocephalus overlying predominantly the bilateral frontal lobes, and foci of hemorrhage in the surgical bed.
No evidence of residual tumor on this non contrast CT.  [**2-26**] CXR: FINDINGS: The lung volumes are rather low.
There is moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of overt pulmonary edema.
No areas of atelectasis or pneumonia.
[**2-28**] Head CT /c contrast: IMPRESSION: Status post left frontal craniotomy changes with improvement of pneumocephalus and stable 3 mm left to right midline shift; focus of hemorrhage with/without residual tumor in the resection bed is similar in appearance to prior exam but now with more surrounding vasogenic edema.
Stable appearance of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Followup to assess for residual tumor/ interval change.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient presented electively on [**2-25**] for left sided craniotomy for mass resection.
Shortly thereafter he was deemed fit for extubation which was done without difficulty.
This did not happen due to bed shortage.
