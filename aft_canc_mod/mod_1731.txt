Admission Date:  [**2108-5-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2108-5-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2030-11-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**] Chief Complaint: Wound erythema, new atrial fibrillation   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation, mechanical ventilation  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 77 year old man with a history of ischemic R foot pain s/p recent R fem-AT popliteal bypass with cephalic vein [**2108-4-27**] who presents to the ED with drainage from his RLE incision and rapid AF without hypotension, with subsequent respiratory code in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
The patient was admitted in early [**Month (only) **] for RLE rest pain and underwent an angiogram which demonstrated R SFA disease, and subsequently underwent R fem-AT popliteal bypass with non-reversed cephalic vein on [**2108-4-27**].
His post-operative course was slightly protracted and complicated by acute on chronic renal failure (creatinine at the time of discharge was 3.9) and a reactive leukocytosis with WBC of ~30 during admission.
This morning, however, he noted some drainage from the dorsal aspect of his R foot with some wound breakdown which prompted his presentation to the [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital ED.
He has not had fevers/chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness.
Also of note, he has never had rapid atrial fibrillation before.
At the Tody ED he had a leukocytosis (WBC 57- baseline is 20-30) and a HR of 140 with rapid AF without hypotension.
At the time of evaluation in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he reports mild pain in his R foot but denies other complaints including chest pain, shortness of breath, and dizziness.
He was stable and mentating well for ~45 minutes, and then had an acute respiratory decompensation with neck/chest pain requiring emergent intubation.
He maintained his pulse throughout the event, and his HR remained tachycardic at ~140 with a SBP>100.
Denied any active complaints at that time.
Past Medical History: Diabetes Mellitus Type Two - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Thrombocythemia - History shingles - Myeloproliferative disorder - Status-post appendectomy, left elbow ulnar nerve repair, carpal tunnel repair, right inguinal hernia repair   Social History: Posting 1PPD tobacco hx quit 40 year ago, EtOH 1 vodka/day, no ilicit drugs.
No acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation anterolaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, 1+ pulses in b/l LE, 1+ edema in b/l LE, no clubbing, cyanosis.
No active bleed noted.
Left lower lobe pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
Small volume abdominal ascites.
Extensive atherosclerotic disease including CAD.
Nonspecific bilateral perinephric stranding.
Left upper pole renal hypodensity could represent a small cyst, too small to characterize.
Prostatic enlargement.
No acute intracranial pathology.
Marked periventricular white matter hypodensity, compatible with small vessel microvascular infarcts.
With these findings the sensitivity for subtle infarcts is diminished, an MRI could be performed if there is persisting concern for acute infarct.
Sinus opacification.
Primary possibilities investigated were pna, flash pulmonary edema vs PE after his recent surgery.
On [**5-16**] the pt became hypoxemic and CXR demonstrated evidence of RUQ pneumonia and possible pulmonary edema.
On the evening of [**5-16**] the patient became hypoxemic to the mid 80s after eating.
Repeat CXR on demonstrated radiographic evidence of increasing consolidation of the RUQ pneumonia with evidence of a new right lower lobe process perhaps secondary to an aspiration event.
Atrial fibrillation:  New onset afib at time of admission, CHADS2 score was 5.
On [**5-16**] the patient developed tachycardia despite diltiazam drip and metoprolol.
Wound infection:  The pt's initial reason for ED visit was for concern for recent surgical procedure.
Leukocytosis:  The patient presented with underlying leukocytosis thought to be reactive from prior work up revealing no evidence of CLL/CML.
GI Bleed: The patient had an EGD [**5-15**] which demonstrated 2 nonbleeding cords of grade II varices which were cauterized.
The patient tolerated heparin challenges and drip with no further bleeds.
The patient's statin were held during the admission and he was placed on his home insulin regiment and BPH medications.
Atrial fibrillation 3.
Hospital Acquired Pneumonia 4.
Aspiration Pneumonia 5.
