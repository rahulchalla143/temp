Placement of an incisional VAC.
Lysis of adhesions   History of Present Illness: 72-year-old morbidly obese woman with a history of thyroid cancer and atrial fibrillation who recently underwent a colonoscopy by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1940**] here at [**Hospital1 827**].
The patient notes that on [**5-9**] she had a colonoscopy and a few days after that she developed severe right-sided pelvic and abdominal pain.
It was not associated with fever, vomiting, change in bowel habits.
fibroid versus ovarian fibroma.
She has been followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for this problem in the past and has basically been observed during this time period.
[**Known firstname **] has been reluctant to undergo surgery for this mass in the past.
She returned after having had a MRI to evaluate her pelvic mass at an outside institution.
It is unclear once again whether this is a fibroid or a tumor of the ovary.
She has undergone an MRA and this reveals significant stenosis of the proximal celiac artery.
There are also dilated anterior and posterior pancreaticoduodenal arteries with aneurysmal dilations and collaterals in the root of the mesentery adjacent the SMA.
A renal lesion was also identified and was advised for evaluation in six months for a pre and post contrast renal MRI.
Also noted was a 3-mm cystic lesion in the pancreatic body.
The patient was recommended to have a preoperative evaluation.
In the interim time period, the patient had elected to proceed with surgery but unfortunately fell and had a urinary tract infection as well as pneumonia.
Her most recent was on [**2-6**] and this reveals little change from her prior chest x-ray, which shows "improved but not complete resolution of a right middle lobe pneumonia," followup is recommended.
Past Medical History: The patient has a history of fib, morbid obesity, and thyroid cancer, which appears to be under control and without evidence of recurrence.
She denies history of hypertension, mitral valve prolapse, asthma, or thromboembolic disorder.
She denies postmenopausal bleeding.
She denies any history of fibroids, cysts, pelvic infections or abnormal Pap smears.
She denies any family history of thromboembolic disorder.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies fever, weight change, or weakness.
HEENT:  Denies headache, visual or hearing changes, epistaxis, dysphasia.
Cardiovascular:  Denies chest pain, palpitations, or orthopnea.
Respirations:  Denies cough, dyspnea, or hemoptysis.
She denies constipation, diarrhea or melena.
GU: Denies dysuria or frequency.
She denies hematuria or abnormal vaginal bleeding.
Neuro:  Denies syncope, paresthesia, or muscle weakness.
Hematologic:  Denies fatigue, petechia, or spontaneous bleeding.
Oral mucosa without evidence of thrush or mucositis.
BACK:  No spinal or CVAT tenderness.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, no apparent distention.
A large vertical midline incision is noted to extend from the umbilicus down.
The pannus is without any evidence of edema or irregularity.
EXTREMITIES:  There is no clubbing or cyanosis.
The pelvic mass on the right side is very difficult to palpate due to the patient's morbid obesity.
There is a fullness appreciated on the right side only.
A rectal exam reveals good sphincter tone without mass or lesion.
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2108-3-22**]):    NO GROWTH.
MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2108-3-18**]):    No MRSA isolated.
[**2108-3-17**] Bilateral Lower extremity dopplers FINDINGS: Focused exam for evaluation for DVT was performed.
The study was moderately limited by body habitus.
IMPRESSION: Moderately limited exam without evidence of lower extremity DVT.
[**2108-3-20**] CXR REASON FOR EXAM: 73-year-old woman with shortness of breath.
Rule out pneumonia versus volume overload.
Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
Mild vascular congestion is new.
Small left pleural effusion slightly increased.
[**2108-3-22**] ECHO The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Dilated ascending aorta.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 16232**] is a 72 year old with multiple comorbidities who underwent an exploratory laparotomy, right salpingo oophorectomy, myomectomy, adhesiolysis for a large ovarian fibroma.
- Patient experienced intermittent periods of confusion which were attributed to narcotic use.
Patient's confusion was much improved with decreased narcotics.
- The patient maintained an oxygen requirement overnight until POD # 4 - The patient had several episodes of desaturation and tachypnea with activity, which was felt to be partially secondary to severe deconditioning and volume overload.
Chest XRay on [**2108-3-16**] suggested mild volume overload.
- Given concern for potential DVT, the patient underwent LENI's on [**2108-3-17**], which were negative - She is discharged  with oxygen saturations in the 94-98% RA  *) Cardiovascular: - Patient has a history of Atrtial fibrillation.
She continued her home doses of flecainaide and metoprolol - Patient has a history of congestive heart failure and continued her home dose of Lasix.
The patient under recommendation of the medicine team underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2108-3-22**] which revealed a mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Dilated ascending aorta.
*) Renal/GU: - The patient had transient oliguria on POD # 2, which resolved spontaneously.
*) Wound care: - Patient had a prophylactic wound vac placed by plastics, which was removed on POD # 3.
- The patient had JP drains x 3 and was receiving prophylactic Kefzol IV while the drains were in place.
*) Prophylaxis - The patient received Protonix and subcutaneous heparin as well as pneumoboots as prophylactic measures during her hospitalization - The patient was also asked to have aggressive incentive spirometry  The patient was discharged home with home PT on POD # 9 in stable condition.
