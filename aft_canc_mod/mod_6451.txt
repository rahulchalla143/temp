# Upper GI bleed: EGD performed in the ICU showed no evidence of ongoing bleeding or stigmata of chronic bleed.
It was felt that the bleed was likely secondary to the EUS with fiduciary placement.
All anticoagulants were held and patient remained hemodynamically stable.
He was transferred to the floor and monitored after restarting Aspirin 81mg without any evidence of recurrent bleeding.
# Fiducial placement: Continued on augmentin per GI and was discharged on this medication for a total course of 5 days.
# Pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
The patient has unresectable adenocarcinoma and plans to undergo Cyberknife with fiducials placed on [**2173-12-16**].
# CAD / DM2: As discussed above, anti-hypertensives were held in the acute setting and restarted prior to discharge.

You were hospitalized because you were vomiting blood after your endoscopic ultrasound procedure.
You were transfused blood because of your bleeding and monitored in the ICU.
In the ICU, the gastrointestinal doctors saw [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and performed an endoscopic grastroduodenscopy to look for active bleeding in your stomach - they found no active bleeding and no signs of old bleeding, which led them to believe that your blood loss was due to the endoscopic ultrasound procedure you had happened several hours before the bleeding started.
We temporarily held some of your blood thinners and anti-hypertensive medications when you were losing blood, but we are restarting MOST - but not ALL - upon discharge.
# STOP Plavix - It is very important that you follow-up with your PCP regarding whether to restart this medication for your heart # START Augmentin for post-endoscopy antibiotic treatment # START Senna for constipation # START Colace for constipation  Followup Instructions: Department: RADIOLOGY When: MONDAY [**2173-12-20**] at 7:45 AM With: CAT SCAN [**Telephone/Fax (1) 327**] Building: [**Hospital6 29**] [**Location (un) 861**] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage  Department: HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY When: MONDAY [**2173-12-20**] at 11:30 AM With: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6050**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8770**] Building: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) 24**] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage  Department: HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY When: MONDAY [**2173-12-27**] at 9:00 AM With: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6050**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8770**] Building: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) 24**] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage
