Admission Date:  [**2177-3-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2177-3-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2108-9-30**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: s/p unwitnessed fall; transferred from [**Hospital1 1474**] for eval of intracranial hemorrhage and non-ST elevation MI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: - placement and removal of right internal jugular central venous catheter - placement and removal of right femoral central venous catheter - placement of left femoral central venous catheter  [**2177-3-4**] IVC filter placement [**2177-3-6**] Bronchoscopy, transbronchial biopsy, bronchoalveolar lavage and brushing [**2177-3-13**] Stereotactic CT guided brain biopsy [**2177-3-14**] Ultrasound-guided liver biopsy  History of Present Illness: 68F with HTN, COPD, EtOH abuse, and question of lung CA presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2177-3-1**], one day after having fallen in the setting of EtOH use.
Pt denies chest pressure or chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations.
The morning after the fall ([**2177-3-1**]) pt's daughter called pt, noted that pt seemed confused, with slurred speech, and brought pt to the ED at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital.
In the ED at [**Name (NI) 1474**] Hospital, pt complained of headache, mild right shoulder pain, and blurry vision.
Her exam was significant for a left frontal echymosis and some swelling around her left orbit.
Pt was alert and oriented x 3, with no focal neurologic deficits.
A head CT revealed right parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Due to hypotension to 79/palp, code sepsis called and pt was started on levophed.
Does not have any pain now, does not feel thirsty.
Pt denies recent fevers at home, denies dysuria, cough, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel movements.
Past Medical History: ETOH abuse HTN R lung mass, possibly malignant, with "spot" in liver - pt due for Bx and staging COPD anxiety   Social History: Lives alone, has someone help with vacuuming and washing the floors.
Pt denies having had shakes [**3-14**] withdrawal or having h/o seizures.
Family History: noncontributory  Physical Exam: VS: 97.9 101/67 98 21 99% 4L NC Gen: disheveled appearing, slurring speech, NAD; C collar in place HEENT: dentition poor, MM dry Neck: could not assess JVP 2/2 C collar in place CV: mildly tachycardic, regular, nl S1/S2, no m/r/g Pulm: CTAB anteriorly Abd: soft, NT/ND, +BS, no masses Ext: no c/c/e Neuro: CN II-XII intact; strength 4+/5 bilaterally, sensation intact to light touch, hyperreflexic in patellar and biceps reflexes; toes neither up nor downgoing bilaterally; has difficulty following commands; oriented to person, hospital in [**Location (un) 86**], not to year (says [**2077**])   Pertinent Results: CT head: hemorrhagic foci in L cerebellum and R frontal lobes with surrounding vasogenic edema, concerning for metastatic foci  .
CT C spine: no acute fracture .
EKG: 115bpm, NSR, nl axis, no ST/T wave changes .
Pulmonary macrophages and rare bronchial cells.
CXR, [**2177-3-6**]: No evidence of pneumothorax status post transbronchial biopsy.
Hazy increased opacity throughout the right upper lobe could be suggestive of a postobstructive process, likely secondary to right hilar adenopathy, better appreciated on recent CT. 3.
Rounded nodular opacity in the medial right upper lobe correlates with mass seen on recent CT. .
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and posterior (inferolateral) walls.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valveleaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Impression: inferior posterior hypokinesis .
Right upper lung nodule concerning for lung carcinoma until proven otherwise.
Partially occlusive intraluminal filling defects inferiorly from the right upper lobe nodule as well as separate left lower lobe fourth order branch filling defect is better visualized on CTA of [**2177-3-3**], but likely still present.
5.4 x 4.0 x 5.0 cm heterogeneously enhancing liver mass as described.
The appearance is more suggestive of a metastatic lesion than primary hepatocellular carcinoma or benign lesion.
Multiple hypoattenuating lesions in both kidneys too small to characterize.
Stable bilateral small pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis.
Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
[**2177-3-12**] Stereotactic brain biopsy, +6 mm (smear #15 only): Reactive brain, numerous cells with small, pyknotic nucleus and red cytoplasm, and single, microscopic, poorly-preserved fragment of atypical cells, suggestive of metastatic carcinoma.
NOTE: The only tissue suggestive of metastatic carcinoma is a single tiny cluster of poorly preserved cells in the final smear.
The remaining tissue is either air dried, necrotic and partially mineralized, or contains blood with frequent nucleated red blood cells.
Nucleated red blood cells are abnormal and make the diagnosis of carcinoma suspect, especially given to poor preservation of the small cluster of suggestive cells.
The current material alone should NOT be the basis of treatment for metastatic carcinoma.
Confirmation of carcinoma elsewhere should be sought (e.g.
[**2177-3-13**] Liver biopsy:  POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent with metastatic small cell carcinoma.
She was found to have an intracranial hemorrhage and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for further management.
During this admission, she was found to have a lung nodule, liver nodule and several brain nodules.
She was also found to have multiple pulmonary emboli.
# Intracranial hemorrhage/lesions: The patient experienced a fall in the setting of alcohol intoxication.
She was found to have an intracranial hemorrhage and multiple lesions on head imaging.
She was started on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis and it was titrated according to serum levels with adjustment for a low albumin.
Sterotactic brain biopsy was performed which demonstrated metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma, histologically similar to the tumor in the patient's subsequent liver biopsy.
# Metastatic small cell lung cancer: A lung nodule was identified on chest CT. A bronchoscopy was performed by Interventional Pulmonary in an attempt to gain tissue.
Bronchial washings performed were negative for malignant cells.
A CT chest/abdomen/pelvis revealed a large superficial lesion in the liver which was amenable to biopsy by ultrasound and demonstrated metastatic small cell carcinoma.
Differential included alcohol withdrawal versus PE.
CTA performed showied intraluminal filling defect arising inferiorly from the right upper lobe lung nodule with extension into a second-order right upper lobe pulmonary artery branch.
Additionally, fourth-order partially occlusive filling defects in the left lower lobe consistent with PE were found.
# Elevated troponin: The patient denies any chest pain during this episode or prior to this episode.
Her troponins were found to trend downward (0.45 -> 0.24 -> 0.18 in the setting of negative CK-MBs; CK was elevated most likely secondary to patient's fall and being immobilized for a period of time).
It was unclear if the troponins were secondary to PE or NSTEMI.
Echocardiogram showed evidence of posterior inferior wall motion abnormalities, raising concern for possible NSTEMI.
Heparin, aspirin and plavix were contraindicated in the setting of the intracranial hemorrhage.
# Possible sepsis: The patient became hypotensive shortly after admission requiring levophed for a brief period.
Given fever and elevated WBC, aspiration PNA resulting in possible sepsis was a concern.
It was unclear if her oxygen requirement was at baseline given a history of COPD.
# COPD: The patient had good air movement on admission without rales or wheezes.
