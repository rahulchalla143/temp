Name:  [**Known lastname 9830**],[**Known firstname 9831**]                  Unit No:   [**Numeric Identifier 9832**]  Admission Date:  [**2129-11-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-11-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2078-11-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1015**] Addendum: [**Hospital Unit Name 1863**] Course [**Date range (1) 9833**]: 51 yo F with end stage metastatic ovarian cancer and pancreatic pseudocyst s/p debulking and cyst-gastrostomy, transferred to the ICU with worsening renal function and persistent leukocytosis.
Further fluids were eventually discontinued in the setting of massive ascites and third spacing with no improvement in her renal function from this intervention.
For her leukocytosis, no definite source was ever identified, though there was radiographic evidence of a possible left lower lobe pneumonia.
In the setting of end-stage ovarian cancer with multi-system organ failure the patient decided to be made comfort measure only and was transferred to the floor for further care.
# Sepsis/leucocytosis - Afebrile since [**11-9**] however has had elevation in WBC upto 32, now trending down.
Large fluid-filled collections in liver not felt to be infectious per radiology consistent with mucinous mets.
Left lower lobe infiltrate noted on abd CT concerning for pneumonia.
Ascitic fluid gram stain negative.
However, did have elevated WBC count to 350 concerning for culture negative neutrocyctic ascities v. spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, both, however, are treated with the same broad spectrum antibiotics.
# Renal Failure - Has been oliguric since [**11-11**] and was been temporarily responsive to IVF boluses.
Last set of urine lytes with Feurea 4.4% and urine Na of 14 consistent with prerenal etiology.
Renal ultrasound neg for post renal causes.
Because of overwhelming ascites and third-spacing of fluids and the fact that patient continued to make urine at a constant, however minimal rate, fluid boluses were discontinued.
Albumin infusions were also administered q6hours for a 24 hour period in an attempt to minimize third spacing of fluid but discontinued when the patient was made CMO.
#: Acute Hematocrit drop - Patient received 2 units pRBC for downward trending HCT.
Downward trending HCT suggested that she was losing blood somewhere, likely source being her abdomen given her high RBC count in her paracentesis.
# Pulmonary Embolism - Had an upper GI bleed on heparin so gtt discontinued and IVC filter placed on [**11-8**], LENI's negative on that day.
# Ileus/Vomiting - Likely multifactorial contributed from recent surgery (pseudocyst marsupilization) and narcotics.
However, as she transitioned to CMO, she requested that it be removed,  Patient expressed full awareness of consequences and stated that she would still like tube out.
# Upper GI Bleed: Thought to be secondary to recent surgery and supratherapeutic PTT.
# Hyperbilirubinemia: Followed but no intervention was thought to be possible in setting of massive ascites and liver metastases.
Palliative care involved Therapeutic paracentesis were performed for abdominal ascites.
