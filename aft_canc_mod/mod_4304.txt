Sphincterotomy was deferred due to coagulopathy (elevated INR to 1.8), but biliary stent was placed successfully.
She has also been mildly anemic but no overt signs of bleeding.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 63834**] (surgeon) and her oncologist did not feel these abnormalities were related to her surgery or chemotherapy.
Of note, she was diagnosed with a LUL PNA, and broadened to Vanco/Zosyn for possible biliary infection plus HCAP.
She has also been given 2 units FFP for her coagulopathy and possible need for repeat ERCP, as well as 2 units PRBCs.
She did have a ?
On admission she complains of fatigue/weakness and shortness of breath with cough.

No mediastinal, hilar, axillary or internal mammary adenopathy.
There is a left-sided Port-A-Cath, its tip is identified within the SVC.
There is a small pericardial effusion measuring maximum thickness anteriorly of 5 mm (series 2, image 35).
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
Evaluation of the lung parenchyma demonstrates marked thickening of the interlobular septae with ground glass change identified within the superior segments of the right lower lobe (series 2, image 21), distal segment of the right middle lobe (series 2, image 25) and within the superior segment of the lingula (series 2, image 31).
No pulmonary masses or nodules.
Evaluation of the upper abdomen demonstrates pneumobilia within the left lobe of the liver with surgical clips identified in the gallbladder fossa, and plastic stent is noted in a decompressed CBD.
CT OSSEOUS SKELETON: Evaluation of the bony skeleton shows multilevel degenerative changes in the dorsal spine with relative osteopenia of the bony skeleton without osseous destructive lesion.
2.Bilateral hazy ground-glass change consistent with intercurrent infection or resolving pulmonary edema.
3.Small bilateral effusions.
RUQ U/S [**2137-10-29**]:FINDINGS: There are no focal hepatic lesions.
There is pneumobilia predominantly in the left lower lobe, as expected after ERCP.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation with the common hepatic duct measuring 4 and the common bile duct measuring 7 mm.
There is no evidence of common bile duct stones, however evaluation with ultrasound is limited.
The pancreas is only partially visualized secondary to overlying bowel gas, but appears normal.
There is no free fluid.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
CXR [**2137-10-28**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-24**], there is some decrease in the opacification in the right mid and lower lung zones, most likely representing some decreasing atelectasis in a patient with improved degree of inspiration.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 yr/o F w/ stage IIIb colon Ca s/p partial colectomy in [**Month (only) 116**] [**2137**], on adjuvant chemo since [**Month (only) **] who recently underwent a lap chole and ERCP for cholecystitis with CBD stones presented with increase in liver function tests, LUL opacity concerning HAP, and fever.
# Tachypnea with hypoxia: likely [**2-26**] to fluid overload based on CXR which showed vascular congestion and diffuse bilateral opacities and exam with anterior crackles/wheezing and abdominal rounding; also may be due to underlying PNA however it was difficult see definite opacity in LUL described at OSH due to volume overloaded on initial examination.
Tachypnea with hypoxia improved throughout ICU stay.
Respiratory status significantly improved but patient still slightly tachypneac after walking.
O2 sats after walking did decrease to 88% and patient is discharged with 2 lit O2 per NC as needed for activity.A CTA was done and there was no evidence a pulmonary embolus.
Pulmonary was also consulted and agreed that sob most likely secondary to edema an drecommended to continue diureses.
# Transaminitis with elevated Tbili: Likely [**2-26**] to recent CBD stones with bypass stent by ERCP on [**10-17**].
Repeat ruq u/s prior to duscharge showed that th eCBD was patent and no evidence of obstruction.
#Diarrhea: Pt did develop diarhhea during hospital course.
A low lactose and low residue diet is recommeded , repeat stool cultures should be done if diarhhea persists.
Patinet did note that she has a history of thrombocytosis that was never investigated or treated .
She also has a family history significant for myeloproliferative disorders.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and a biliary tract obstruction as well as pulmonary edema (fluid in your lungs).You received a course of broad spectrum antibiotics nad also diuresed with significant improvement in your shortness of breath.
You should have labs drawn to check a cbc to follow plt count and electrolytes to asses any need for potassium supplements and renal function.
