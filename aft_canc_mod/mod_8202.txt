ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2162-7-31**]):       CLOSTRIDIUM SPECIES NOT C. PERFRINGENS OR C. SEPTICUM.
Small intraperitoneal air and large ascites.
Hemoperitoneum cannot be excluded given the slightly increased density of fluid in the cul de sac.
Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the patient does not have a history of recent paracentesis.
Abnormal cecum consistent with known malignancy with liver mestases, peritoneal carcinomatosis and mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
Bone metastases with impression on the thecal sac, particularly at L5.
Consider MRI if there is no recent MRI already performed.
Brief Hospital Course: 61M with cecal carcinoma metastatic to the liver, s/p 2 weeks of radiation and chemotherapy who presented with increased shortness of breath, fatigue and abdominal pain who was found to have bowel perforation with bacterial peritonitis.
The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with abdominal pain and was found to have ascites and free air w/ sepsis.
Diagnostic and therepeutic paracentesis was preformed, results showed high polys and gram negative rods, it was felt that he had a small perforation in his GI tract leading to bacterial peritonitis.
Discussions were initiated with palliative care.
Palliative care was consulted and recommended increasing morphine for pain control.
He has worsening liver and kidney failure and his mental status declined.
# Bowel perforation: Pt was found to have had a perforated bowel and was initially started on broad spectrum abx.
Pt was found to have gram negative rods growing in his peritonial fluid.
# Sepsis: He was initially hypotensive in the setting of presumed infection but his BP stablilized after fluid resuscitation.
# Metastatic colon ca/pancytopenia- The patient is s/p 2 weeks of radiation and chemotherapy for metastatic colon cancer.
Recent chemotherapy is likely the cause of his pancytopenia as it did improve somewhat after treatment for sepsis.
# Liver Failure/ [**Name (NI) 112073**] Pt had severe jaundice secondary to hyperbilirubimemia which is likely related to his liver mets and biliary cholestasis which was previously diagnosed.
# Coagulopathy- Secondary to hepatic mets.
No evidence of bleeding was present.
# [**Last Name (un) 13160**] Pt had poor renal function which was intially thought to be seondary to his hypotension and pre-renal etiology.
Cause of death Primary Diagnosis: Bowel Perforation Secondary Diagnosis: Metastatic Cecal Carcinoma PCP and outpatient oncologist were notified of his death.
