Her post-chemotherapy course was complicated by febrile neutropenia and pancytopenia.
She remained thrombocytopenic following this without a response to steroids and only minimal response to IVIG.
She began maintenance Rituxan on [**4-/2165**], but her course was complicated by diffuse arthralgias.
Due to increasing painful lymphadenopathy and IVC compression seen on CT, she was treated with chlorambucil from [**2166-2-24**] through [**2166-4-3**].
This was then stopped due to thrombocytopenia.

#) Lymphadenopathy / Airway compromise: Although patient was admitted for jaw/tooth pain, she was noted to have significant facial edema and odynophagia.
After outside records were reviewed, it was discovered that patient did not have dental evaluation as previously reported, but instead had CT scan which was concerning for airway compromise.
CT scan of neck and torso was performed here and revealed severe narrowing of the airway at the level of the oropharynx.
ORL service noted narrowing in upper airway and edema which would make emergant intubation difficult.
Etiology of edema thought to be [**2-14**] to extensive lymphadenopathy decreasing lymphatic draingage.
Initial biopsy plans had been delaye3d by hypertensive urgency thought related to her underlying difficult to control BP in the setting of steroids.
Bone marrow biopsy done ([**1-13**]) to re-evaluate etiology of thrombocytopenia in preparation for chemotherapy decision-making.
Dexamethasone 40mg was given when airway compromise first suspected and tumor lysis labs monitored.
Patient became dyspneic and tachypneic on the floor, and was transferred to MICU for closer monitoring as there was significant concern regarding airway patency.
She was electively intubated and sedated for airway protection in preparation for LN biopsy and subsequent planned radiation (to protect against radiation induced edema and need for urgent intubation).
She received radiation treatments on [**1-15**] and [**1-16**], and had daily cuff leaks checked.
After this she complained of burning pain in her throat, which was likely related both to her nasotracheal intubation and to the radiation to her throat.
She developed thrush on her last day of her MICU stay.
When transferred back to the oncology service, she was still complaining of some difficulty breathing, had severe thrush, had an NG tube in place, and her sodium was 149.
She continued to receive daily XRT to the throat and neck, and remained on a slow steroid taper to control her swelling (10mg daily at time of d/c).
Her oropharyngeal and neck edema continued to improve.
She is next due for XRT on [**2-3**], and had completed [**12-31**] sessions by discharge.
Patient initially placed on Cefepime for febrile neutropenia while cultures were made available.
Patient noted to have history of agranulocytosis with beta-lactams; antibiotic regimen changed for levaquin and clindamycin for 14 day course.
However, once transferred to the MICU, after biopsy showed CLL in her lymph nodes and there was no evidence of jaw infection, antibiotics were stopped.
However, on [**1-19**] she developed fevers while on the vent, up to 101.3, and was treated for VAP based on gram stain showing GPCs.
We continued treating with vanco, levo, flagyl (a second-line approach because of her beta-lactam allergy) with a planned 7 day course for VAP.
Foley catheter removed and pt followed off antibiotics for symptoms and evidence of fever.
#) Hypertension: Patient had history of malignant hypertension in prior admissions with symptoms of headache and epigastric / left sided chest pain.
Patient experienced new episode during this hospitalization after discontinuation of lisinopril after this was held for worsening renal insufficiency, in spite of addition of hydralazine PO PRN for SBP > 160 and Q4H vital signs.
Patient was ruled out for MI and likely experienced this episode secondary to Dexamethasone therapy.
An echo was done and showed mild pulmonary artery hypertension and preserved systolic function with LVEF >55%.
Her pressures became elevated during the latter part of her MICU stay but she was having great difficulty with swallowing, so she was put on IV metoprolol and hydralazine to control pressures as needed; she was also started on a clonidine patch.
#) Atrial Fibrillation - on [**1-27**] pt was noted to be in an irregular rhyhtm and EKG confirmed Afib.
Due to her chronic low platelets she was not a candidate for anticoagulation.
She did not experience chest pain, palpitations, or RVR.
#) Acute renal failure / Chronic renal failure: Although patient has known chronic renal insufficiency, she was noted to be above her baseline at admission.
Urine electrolytes revealed FeUrea greater than 40% and nephrotoxic drugs were stopped.
The cause of her next worsening while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] (a return to peak of 2.2) may have been the initiation of steroids.
On the floor, with aggressive rehydration for hypernatremia (max was 151), her creatinine decreased to baseline.
CBC's were checked daily with criteria for transfusion being HCT 21 and platelets of 10. .
We transitioned several to IV during this period and treated pain with PRN meds.
She was diagnosed with thrush on her day of transfer from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
#) CAD: Although patient experienced malignant hypertensive episode with associated chest pain, there were no ECG changes and cardiac enzymes were negative x 3.
Aspirin therapy was considered but not given due to thrombocytopenia.
Glyburide restarted prior to discharge after patient demonstrated acceptable po intake.
However, when she developed new afib, thyroid studies were again checked.
#) ACCESS: L PICC placed [**1-26**] (previously had R PICC but D/C'ed [**2-14**] thrombus)  #) PPx: Pneumoboots, PPI because of high dose steroids, bowel regimen.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Lymphadenopathy Causing Tracheal Obstruction  Secondary diagnosis: CLL CAD CHF CRI HTN Hyperlipidemia DM type II Hypothyroidism Atrial Fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Good, stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with fever and jaw pain.
A CT scan was done which showed tracheal obstruction from buildup of lymph nodes in your chest and neck.
While intubated in our ICU, you developed a fever and completed a course of antibiotics for a presumed pneumonia.
You also had evidence of bacteria in your urine.
If you do develop these symptoms please contact your doctor.
You did develop a superficial blood clot in your right arm, where you had a special kind of catheter called a PICC line.
We did an ultrasound and it showed no clot there.
Your heart also developed an abnormal rhythm called atrial fibrillation.
If you develop any symptoms which concern you, such as fevers/chills, bleeding, or breathing difficulty, please call your doctor or go to the ER.
