Right cervical incision with scalene fat pad and lymph     node resection as well as mobilization of superior sulcus     tumor off of 1st rib and division of the 2nd rib     anteriorly.
Thoracic lymphadenectomy.
History of Present Illness: 62-year-old woman who developed right shoulder pain and was found to have a large right upper lobe tumor invading into the 2nd and 3rd ribs and abutting up against the 1st rib.
She underwent cervical mediastinoscopy as well as peripheral metastatic workup.
There were no positive lymph nodes and no metastasis.
Our plan was to biopsy the scalene fat pad and lymph nodes and if there is no evidence of tumor to move on to mobilize the superior sulcus tumor from the cervical incision, including division of ribs as necessary.

FINDINGS: There has been interval removal of two right apical chest tubes.
No definite pneumothorax identified.
There are post-surgical changes at the right apex including signs of volume loss of the right hemithorax with persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and mediastinal shift to the right.
Again noted are multiple surgical rib defects at the right apex.
IMPRESSION: Interval removal of right apical pleural drains.
No definite pneumothorax.
Surgical changes at the right apex with associated volume loss of the right hemithorax.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted on [**2171-10-18**] for ecxision of Pancoast tumor in RUL.

PT, IS, ambulation cont w/ high compliance.
Pt R/O'd for MI by enzymes and EKG.
Lovenox started for anticoagulation in setting of intermittent Afib post epidural d/c.
Evidence of left antecubital phlebitis(red, swollen, min discomfort) at old IV site present, Keflex po x10 days started, warm soaks locally w/ small improvement.
Incision- no erythema, small amount serous drainage superior posterior incision.
