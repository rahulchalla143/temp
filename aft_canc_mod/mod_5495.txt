History of Present Illness: This is an 81-year-old gentleman with unresectable pancreatic cancer who has been developing worsening pain of his left lower extremity over the past several months with significant increase in severity over the past 2 days with loss of some motor and sensory function noted within the last day.
He had a rather cyanotic foot.
Newly diagnosed pancreatic mass encasing the SMA and obstructing the portal and splenic veins.
Brushing from the common bile duct with atypical glandular epitheleal cells.
COPD on 2.5L oxygen at home.
Coronary artery disease.
Atrial fibrillation status post pacemaker placement.

MODERATE GROWTH.
[**2132-10-23**] 11:51 AM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage.
There is a probable subacute to chronic lacunar infarct within the left corona radiata.
A second, either subacute or chronic lacunar infarct is seen within the left lentiform nucleus.
Considering patient age, there is the expected involutional change of the brain parenchyma identified.
There is moderate atherosclerotic calcification of the cavernous portions of both internal carotid arteries.
No overt extracranial abnormalities are discerned.
CONCLUSION: No definite evidence for acute intracranial pathology.
However, in this regard, MRI scanning with diffusion-weighted imaging, if feasible, is a more sensitive imaging study in the detection of acute brain ischemia.
The more proximal aspect, however, takes an expected course through the mediastinum and left upper quadrant, consistent with placement within the gastrointestinal tract.
Please refer to the portable abdominal radiograph obtained for further details.
The study is of marginal diagnostic quality for lung evaluation secondary to respiratory motion.
Linear atelectasis is seen in the left lung base.
Grossly, no new consolidations are identified.
No significant edema is seen.
Likewise, there has been no interval change in the course or position of a right internal jugular approach central venous catheter device.
Please refer to abdominal x-ray for further details.
Marginal diagnostic quality of study otherwise, however, no qualitative significant interval change   Brief Hospital Course: pt admitted  underwent a Left lower extremity and bilateral pelvic arteriography of right external iliac angioplasty and stent placement.
Post operative - respiratory distress and is intermittently agitated and non-verbal with decreased responsiveness, in the context of receiving haldol, ativan and morphine for sedation  nuerology consulted - respiratory acidosis with renal compensation / Head CT is normal  transfered to SICU for hemodynamic instability.
