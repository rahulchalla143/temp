Sometime after 7PM, her husband felt that she was having some difficulty talking and that she was "not making sense."
Her husband helped her to bed, though he noted that she had no obvious weakness or facial droop noted, nor difficulty with gait.
In retrospect (on ROS) she seemed slightly unstable on feet prior night.
She has had a chronic cough (productive, no hemoptysis) over months.
She has also c/o CP at night.
No wt loss/f/c/GI c/o except for constipation, and no urinary/MSK c/o.
She has had some memory problems for several months (remembering names, etc.)
She has c/o some insomnia, fatigue recently, and itching of the ears, but all other ROS neg.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Hyperlipidemia GERD depression osteoma left skull spindle cell neoplasm/leomysis cutis on knee skin cancer s/p biopsy several mo ago  Social History: Lives with husband does not smoke or drink; former accountant, has two children.
Family History: no cancers, strokes or seizures in the family  Physical Exam: T 96.3  BP initially 202/96 (down to 142/48 when seen), HR 80s, RR 18  98%RA->95%2L in ER General appearance: well appearing initially HEENT: moist mucus membranes, clear oropharynx Neck: supple, no bruits Heart: regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs Lungs: poor insp effort, no apparent crackles/rhonchi/wheezes Abdomen: soft, nontender +bs Extremities: warm, well-perfused Skull & Spine: no TTP along spine  Mental Status: alert and interactive, but cannot answer questions appropriately with Russian interpreter at bedside (asks interpreter "how are you" but this is only sentence heard, occasionally says 1 word).
No other commands.
Motor System and sensory: Difficult to assess due to limited commands - provides resistance on L arm better than R, and L leg slightly better than R - full strength at bilat IPs, foot plantarflexion, but everywhere else limited by ability to follow commands.
Reflexes: The tendon reflexes are trace throughout, with upgoing toe on R, down on L.  Coordination: No obvious ataxia with mvmt, copied F-N with hand->nose instead, but did not appear tremulous or dysmetric.
Pertinent Results: Admission labs: WBC 11.3 D  H/H 13.4/39.3  PLT 255 N:62.5 L:31.4 M:4.4 E:1.0 Bas:0.7  PT: 11.5  PTT: 21.0  INR: 1.0  UA neg x 30 protein  HCT: Multiple foci consistent with acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the left temporal and parietal lobes as described above, with probable hemorrhage also within the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle without subfalince herniation.
Repeat HCT: Marked interval enlargement of the left temporal parenchymal hemorrhage, with marked increase in mass effect producing compression of the left lateral ventricle and dilatation of the right lateral ventricle, probable subfalcine and possible uncal herniation.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: There is definite evidence of subfalcine and uncal herniation, as there is medial displacement of the uncus of the right temporal lobe, as well as effacement of the right perimesencephalic cistern and slight rotation of the midbrain and distortion of the ipsilateral ambient cistern.
There is no evidence of ipsilateral PCA territorial infarction.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 y/o Russian speaking female with hx hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, depression, osteoma left skull and ?spindle cell neoplasm/leomysis cutis on knee, and apparent hx skin cancer s/p bx few mo ago presents with difficulty speaking and understanding, initially found on exam to have mixed aphasia with both sensory and motor components, no repetition, subtle R sided weakness, head CT with multiple foci of hemorrhage (lobar).
Several hours later, she acutely decompensated with seizure, L blown pupil, uncal herniation on CT with large expansion of L temporal lobe bleed.
Etiology of hemorrhage is unclear, with concern for metastases given multiple foci of hemorrhage, though still possible that the bleed was from an underlying vascular anomaly, HTN or amyloid; the family denied trauma.
After 24hours off all sedation, she had a formal brain death exam, which was notable for absence of all brain stem reflexes, including apnea response.
