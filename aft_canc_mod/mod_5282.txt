He showed improvement in his leukocytosis and respiratory status.
His CXR was negative for new infiltrates and his Ucx was clear, but his blood grew MRSA and he was placed on IV vancomycin.
He showed an elevated d-dimer, and was subsequently found to have R popliteal DVT on LE Dopplers.
His respiratory status continued to worsen, but his VQ scan showed low probability for pulmonary embolism.
Given patient's obesity and immobility, he was placed on lovenox and warfarin.
On presentation to the Medicine Service at [**Hospital1 **], patient complains of having pain and discomfort in his shoulder and neck for many months.

Mr [**Known lastname 66103**] is a 74yo morbidly obese male with hx significant for HTN, stroke, cor pulmonale [**3-17**] COPD, CRI, DM, and stroke, transfered from OSH with LLE DVT, PE, and lympadenopathy on CT. .
#Enlarged lymph nodes on CT: Patients clinical presentation was most concerning for lymphoma, especially given his family history of leukemia and exposure to [**Doctor Last Name 360**] [**Location (un) 2452**].
However, sensation of abdominal fullness and bone pain, reported as pain in his back and neck, may be indicative of the nontender diffuse LAD of NHL.
Patient has remained febrile, even during infection with MRSA per records; however, he has had the other constitutional or B symptoms of weight loss and sweats.
The rapid progression of his LAD may suggest an aggressive lymphoma such as mantle cell.
HD Limited disease has 80% long-term survival, whereas advanced disease has a considerably less survial time.
Patient's recent respiratory decline may be [**3-17**] mediastinal mass obstructing the airway.
CRI: Patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency.
It is important to realize that renal involvement with lymphoma is seen in 2 to 14 percent of all patients, and an elevated serum creatinine is reported in 26 to 56 percent.
GERD: denies any current symptoms -protonix .
Diabetes -insulin sliding scale .
Preliminary pathology results showed poorly-differentiated large cell carcinoma with focal glandular and focal clear cell features.
