to [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in the inferior leads, lead 3 greater than lead 2, ST elevation V1 and V2, and right sided lead showing ??????
She was then made pain free with Morphine 2 mg and 2.5 mg IV Lopressor.
Chest x-ray showed deviated trachea and mild CHF.
Per family discussion, she will not have cath or CABG.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Coronary artery disease, status post inferior MI in 9/00, cath in 9/00 showed 100% proximal RCA lesion, left main with 20% lesion, proximal LAD with 80% lesion, LAD 90% lesion, D1 80% lesion, D2 90% lesion, proximal left circumflex 100% lesion, OM1 70% lesion with cardiac output of three liters.
3) Auto immune hemolytic anemia.
4) Pelvic mass, refused intervention.
8) Congestive heart failure with EF of 30-40%.
9) Spinal stenosis.
11) Hip fracture.
Chest x-ray showed deviated trachea with mild failure.
EKG with pain showed normal sinus rhythm with rate of 82, normal axis and intervals, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in lead 3, ??????
mm ST elevation in AVF, lead 2 and 1-[**Street Address(2) 12501**] elevation in V1 and V2.
Pain free EKG showed improved ST elevations in leads 3, AVF, decreased ST depressions in lead 1, AVL, decreased ST elevations in V1 and V2.
Echocardiogram from [**7-/2191**] showed mild LAE, mild focal septal hypertrophy, LV depression with inferior hypokinesis, posterior akinesis and lateral hypokinesis.
There is also trace AR and mild to moderate MR with no effusions.

She was ruled out for an MI with three consecutive cardiac enzymes which showed decreasing CPK but no significant troponin leak.
She underwent echocardiogram that morning which showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with overall left ventricular systolic function mildly depressed and posterior hypokinesis present.
There were mildly thickened aortic valve and mitral valve leaflets with 1-2+ mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary:  Miss [**Known lastname 93077**] [**Last Name (Titles) 8337**] IV fluids without pulmonary edema or dropping O2 sats.
GI:  As stated above, Miss [**Known lastname 93077**] was guaiac positive but could be secondary to hemorrhoids.
