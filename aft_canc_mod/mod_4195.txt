HPI: 44 yo F with metastatic lung cancer to brain s/p recent chemotherapy (C2D1 of Taxotere on [**2107-3-2**]) who was transferred from [**Location (un) 2274**] oncology clinic with persistent nausea, vomiting, and hypotension to the 80s.
Patient of note recently had a CT Torso from [**2107-3-16**] which showed progression of her metastatic disease including in her lungs, mediastinal lymph nodes, and new hepatic masses.
There has been discussion with her outpatient oncologist about clinical trials with TKIs but the patient needs to off chemotherapy for one month and needs to qualify for the study.
Patient reports persistent nausea and vomiting for the several days.
She did not have any nausea immmediately after her chemotherapy.
She has been vomiting up her food, but no blood.
No diarrhea, and no abdominal pain.
She received 1 L of NS in her clinic for an SBP of 80, decadron, zofran, and IV morphine for her back pain in the clinic prior to transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
States her upper extremity swelling is worse after receiving IVFs today.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denied diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: [**Known firstname **] was in her usual state of health up until [**2106-4-20**] when she developed RUQ abdominal pain.
An abdominal US showed abnormal thickening of the gallbladder and cholecystitis, w/o intra/extra hepatic dilatation, changes c/w fatty liver disease, and a small pleural effusion.
She underwent cholecystectomy and 1 week post op developed pericardial effusion.
She had a mammogram that showed benign microcalcifications, no radiographic evidence of malignancy.
A repeat echocardiogram [**5-26**] showed EF 60%, nl LV thickness and wall motion, normal RV/LA, no valvular dysfunction and no effusion.
1 week prior her [**Hospital1 18**] admission, patient developed swelling in her right neck which was thought to be reactive lymphadenopathy.
Over the next two days she developed DOE and went to [**Hospital6 **] where she was found to have redeveloped pericardial effusion w/o tamponade.
Also had multiple clots in both UEs with multiple subsegmental PE's; received IVF filter and enoxaparin.
Hospital course was complicated by a large abdomino/pelvic hemoperitoneum due to ruptured ovarian cyst vs.  drop metastases.
MRI head [**7-5**] showed solitary met in left temporal lobe which she underwent SRS for on [**7-13**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 3929**].
Completed six cycles of cis/navelbine (C6D8 on [**2106-11-1**]) Chemotherapy complicated with hospital admission for neutropenia  Also concern for TB initially but seen by [**Hospital1 18**] ID, TB treatment not necessary based on subtype [**Date range (1) 87462**]- Admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with increase in dyspnea, facial swelling.
Pericardial tamponade requiring window and left pleural effusion.
Extensive clot burden resulting in SVC syndrome, no intervention possible.
[**2107-2-28**]: Neuro follow-up MRI with new brain mets.
PMH: - Lung adenocarcinoma with known mets to brain, dx [**6-/2106**]; metastatic to brain s/p cyberknife therapy, malignant pleural and pericardial effusions s/p pericardiocentesis (see above for further details) - DVTs s/p IVC and SVC filters - Malignant pleural effusion s/p drainage - PE s/p IVF on chronic lovenox and s/p IVC filter - Mycobacterium gordonae - s/p CCY - s/p pericardiocentesis   Social History: She is originally from the [**Country 31115**] in [**2092**], lives with husband.
No smoking, alcohol, or illicit drug use  Family History: Mother with diabetes.
Pulm: crackles at R/L lower bases BL.
Extremities: wwp, no edema in BLLEs, 4+ pitting edema in bilateral upper extremities.
Interval increase in the degree of bulky supraclavicular, axillary, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Heterogeneous enhancement of the thyroid, new from the prior study, concerning for infarction or hypoperfusion.
Metastatic infiltration is another less likely consideration.
Improved aeration of the lungs despite right upper lobe bronchial obstruction.
Right upper and middle lobe masses appear enlarged compared with the CT torso [**2107-1-17**] with bilateral chest tubes in place and small left pleural effusion.
Multiple new hepatic metastases as described above with new right and left adrenal lesions and possible development of peritoneal disease.
Diffuse osseous involvement of multiple lower cervical and upper thoracic vertebral bodies as well as focal lesions in the L2 and L3 vertebral bodies.
Irregularity of the T3 and T4 superior endplates concerning for new pathologic fractures.
CO3-25 AnGap-14  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 44 yo woman with metastatic lung cancer s/p six cycles of cisplatin and navelbine presenting with persistent nausea, vomiting, and hypotension presented from oncology clinic found to have obstructive uropathy and pyelonephritis.
# Obstructive Uropathy:  The patient underwent nephrostomy tube placement by interventional radiology in attempt to alleviate obstruction likely caused by metastatic spread of primary lung cancer to the retroperitoneum.
Procedure complicated by hypotension and septic shock likely related to urosepsis.
#) NSCLC adeno, stage IV: Advanced disease - per primary oncologogist the patient had worsening lymphadenopathy, liver, brain and bony mets since most recent course of taxotere.
#) h/o PE: IVC filters inplace.
Continued anticoagulation, held for procedure .
#) Stage 2 ulcer - stable  Medications on Admission: .
9. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
13. morphine 15 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every twenty-four(24) hours as needed for pain: To be used for pain from pleurex drainages; do not drive or operate machinery.
