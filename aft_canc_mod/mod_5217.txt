It is unclear if the mass located in the parenchyma represents primary tumor in the hilar mass, a nodal met.
The appearance of these lesions are worrisome for lung carcinoma.
Small pleural-based lesions within left lung also suspicious for malignancy.
Pockets of mediastinal air tracking into the soft tissues of the neck consistent with patient's recent history of bronchoscopy.
Low attenuation lesion of right lobe of thyroid indeterminate for metastatic lesion.
Likely a metastatic lesion of left iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**].
MRI brain: IMPRESSION: Features most likely due to metastases, bilateral mid frontal, right posterior parietal, and dural-based metastasis in the anterior part of the tentorium cerebelli.
FNA, Lung, right upper lobe mass at right mainstem bronchus:   POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS consistent with non-small cell carcinoma.
