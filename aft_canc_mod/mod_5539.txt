Admission Date:  [**2174-9-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2174-11-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-12-17**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Dolasetron Mesylate  Attending:[**Known firstname 7591**] Chief Complaint: Admitted for chemotherapy for AML  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Placement of right IJ line; removal of right IJ bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 69581**] is a 63 year old man with history of Crohn's Disease that was recently admitted to an OSH for abdominal pain presumed to be a Crohn's flair, and during which he was found to be leukopenic.
Approximately ten days prior to admission at [**Hospital1 18**], Mr. [**Known lastname 69581**] experienced intense abdominal pain that was similar in quality to his normal Crohn's flair; the only difference was that he did not vomit as he normally does with his flairs.
At the time, he attributed the pain to dietary indiscretion.
The pain recurred over the next several days, even causing him to skip work.
He denies weight loss (lost 8 lbs with flair, but gained back; this is normal for flair), no fevers, some night sweats (in hospital).
His energy level has decreased over the past few weeks, and he has felt extremely tired and fatigued.
The patient does complain of increased leg swelling R>L, but a venous Doppler was negative (per patient's wife).
Denies arthritis and rashes.
Family History: Mother died of cancer (age 67), father died of cerebral aneurysm.
Midline abdominal scar.
Back: No spinal tenderness, no CVAT.
1+ pitting edema bilaterally  Pertinent Results: BONE MARROW: [**9-21**]: 22% Blasts,  4% Promyelocytes, 4% Myelocytes, 3% Metamyelocytes,  2% Bands/Neutrophils, 2% Plasma cells, 15% Lymphocytes, 48% Erythroid .
Markedly hypocellular bone marrow consistent with post-therapy myelo-ablation (see note) 2.
No morphologic evidence of acute myelogenous leukemia seen.
The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Inflammation and thickening of the wall of the distal small bowel up to the level of the anastomosis with the colon with resultant narrowing of the lumen.
Findings are most consistent with a Crohn's disease with acute inflammation.
There is dilation of the more proximal small bowel, though contrast is seen to flow into the colon, suggestive of partial obstruction.
There is no focal abscess or fluid collection identified.
Heterogeneous appearance of the prostate gland with an area of slightly lower attenuation centrally.
In the correct setting, the findings could be due to prostatitis or a small focal abscess.
A 11-mm nonobstructing left renal collecting system stone.
Persistent and slightly improved neoterminal ileitis consistent with Crohns flare.
Skin Biopsy [**2174-10-10**]: Epidermal acanthosis with parakeratotic scale, dyskeratotic keratinocytes and mild focal superficial perivascular lymphocytic inflammation.
Brief Hospital Course: #) AML: Patient was diagnosed with AML and bone marrow biopsy on [**9-21**] revealed 22% Blasts.
In addition, he developed abdominal pain on [**9-28**] c/w his usual Crohn's flare and meropenem added.
No leukocytoclastic vasculitis or leukemia cutis seen; no inflammation and no evidence of a deep fungal infection.
He developed bone pain to neupogen which was well controlled with oxycodone.
#) Fevers/hypotension: Over the hospital course, he developed fevers and hypotension.
The work-up was negative with no evidence of bowel infection, but some infiltrates on chest CT. Bronchoscopy on [**10-12**] was negative, cultures negative.
After [**10-17**], he had no further issues with fever or hypotension.
#) Transaminitis/Elevated INR: He was noted to have persistently elevated INR as well as periods of elevated LFT's.
He was started on Vitamin K in his TPN with no improvement.
He also has periods of mild transaminitis with negative work-up (normal RUQ U/S and no clincial symptoms).
This was explained to him and his children were encouraged to also have iron tests.
GI was consulted [**9-22**], and recommended strict dietary control (No fiber, no lactose).
On [**9-30**], he developed worsening abdominal pain and was started on high dose steroids with a rapid taper.
Howeevr, while on high dose steroids, he developed bradycardia to 30-40's.
EP consulted, believed to be secondary to increased vagal tone vs. rare effect of methylprednisolone.
The bradycardia resolved following steroid taper.
For the remainder of the hospital course, he was pain free.
At discharge, it was felt that he should take this window of time before next course of chemo to have the 4 cm inflammed segment of his small bowel surgically resected.
#) Elevated PSA.
Elevated at 9.8, never been elevated before.

In addition, your body iron levels are high and blood tests were suggestive of a disease called hemachromatosis.
Please call 911 or your primary physician if you have any worsening abdominal pain, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, nausea/vomiting, or any other concerning symptoms.
You need to stay on fluconazole for fungal infection prevention   Followup Instructions: You have an appointment to follow-up with Dr. [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5026**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 3237**] Date/Time:[**2174-11-10**] at 10:30 AM.
Also, you should contact your GI surgeon regarding resection for your Crohn's disease as we discussed.
