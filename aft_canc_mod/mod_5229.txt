History of Present Illness: This is a 65 y/o woman with no known past medical history (she has not had medical care in about 20 years), who presented to the ED at an OSH complaining of abdominal pain.
She says she was getting out of the shower when she all of a sudden developed a [**9-27**] pressure like abdominal pain.
She denies any nausea, vomiting associated with the pain, was not eating at the time.
The pain was so severe she became diaphoretic.
She has never had this abdominal pain before.
She denies any family history of breast or ovarian cancer.
In the ED at the OSH, she had an abdominal ultrasound which showed a ascites.
This prompted a CT scan which was notable for a complex cystic low abdominal and pelvic mass, measuring 16 x 16.5 x 11.5 cm, positioned superior to the uterus.
She was admitted to the OSH, and overnight, she developed a leukocytosis to 23,600, up from 11,000 on admission with a bandemia of 25%.
On arrival, the patient denied shortness of breath.
Her last episode of hematuria was ~1-2 weeks ago.
She denies chest pain.
Family History: She has a father who died of lung disease at 59 and a mother who died of "[**Last Name **] problem" at 70s.
She has no FH of breast or ovarian cancer.

Respiratory failure In the MICU, she underwent evaluation to r/o pulmonary embolus given her rapid decompensation.
Given the likelihood of acute renal failure from CT contrast, she could not be evaluated with CTA.
In consultation with Pulmonary Medicine, the decision was made not to treat her for pulmonary embolus.
Her respiratory failure was thought to be secondonary to mod/large bilat effusions seen on chest CT and large ascites, as well as volume overload from acute renal failure.
No hemorrhage was seen.
Acute Renal failure: On presentation to the MICU, the patient was anuric and her creatinine was significantly higher than at the OSH.
A CT of the abdomen on [**2-9**] showed no evidence of obstruction.
Fevers - On arrival, the patient was noted to have a fever with leukocytosis.
The CXR had no evidence of infiltrates.
The abdominal ultrasound showed some cholelithiasis but no evidence of cholecystitis.
Altered mental status: On presentation, the patient had altered mental status that was thought to be secondary to taking dilaudid and benzodiazepine at OSH.
Once stable from her respiratory status, she underwent CT Head that revealed a small hyperdense mass in right cerebellum c/w meningioma.
Elevated cortisol: On arrival, the patient was found to have elevated cortisol levels.
This was thought to be due to acute stress reaction and leukomoid reaction.
As rare forms of ovarian cancer can also cause ectopic ACTH production, ACTH was also measured and found to be mildly elevated at 52.
Hypothyroidism: The patient was found to have an elevated TSH of 13 during her ICU stay.
Pelvic mass: CT of the abdomen from OSH suggested a large pelvic mass.
On her second day, she underwent paracentesis under ultrasound guidance to improve her respiratory status and to R/O bacterial peritonitis.
Although the fluid seemed suggestive of peritonitis, this was not associated with bacteria on gram stain.
No malignant cells were seen.
Her CA-125 was mildly elevated at 96, CEA as measured at 10, a 19-9 was significantly elevated at >[**Numeric Identifier 38500**] and her HCG was negative.
Given the elevation in CA [**52**]-9, she was seen by the surgical oncology who did not feel that this was consistent with pancreatic cancer despite such an abnormally elevated CA [**52**]-9.
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2028**] from gynecology-oncology recommended exploratory laparotomy for likely ovarian cancer once stabilised.
* The patient was taken to the operating room where she underwent exploratory laparotomy, supracervical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, partial omentectomy, pelvic mass resection for large mass from R ovary.
* Her post-op course was complicated by: 1. wound infection 2. tachypnea likely secondary to atelectasis and pneumonia and presumed pulmonary embolus * 1.
Wound: On post-op day #2, the patient was found to have a wound infection for which she completed a 5 day course with vancomycin with complete resolution.
Tachypnea: On post-op day #4, the patient was found to be tachypneic with considerable shortness of breath at rest.
An ABG was performed that did not show evidence of hypoxemia.
There was concern for pulmonary embolus given that the patient had initially developed respiratory failure and had not been treated for embolus.
Pulmonary medicine was consulted and they felt strongly that this was likely secondary to atelectasis and mucus plugings but could not rule out pneumonia or pulmonary embolus.
Given her renal failure from CT contrast, she was not recommended for CTA.
US of the LE was performed that did not show evidence of DVT.
As pulmonary embolus could not be definitively ruled out, they recommended empiric therapy with lovenox.
Otherwise, her pain was well controlled, she was tolerating a regular diet and urinating without difficulty.
