Night sweats improved with one episode per night when he noted new onset chills last 2 nights, rigors today, with fever to 103.5 last night and 103 this am and progressively worsening SOB, chest tightness and DOE last [**2-6**] days with SOb with minimal activuty (speaking, walking across room).
Denies cough or hemotypsis.
Associated symptoms include intermittent diarrhea with loose stools 3 days ago and again today but no N/V or abd pain.
Has mild HA and neck/back stiffness but no photophobia.
+ h/o weight loss 8 pounds last 1-2 weeks.
3 days ago, was not having any respiratory symptoms and able to work in garden, walk up stairs with no difficulty.
Denies [**Last Name (LF) **], [**Known lastname **], rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, enlarged or painful LNs, melena, hematochezia, visual chages, numbness, weakness, joint aches/stiffness.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: ====================== Burkitt's lymphoma on [**2110-8-13**] after having a lymph node biopsy of the right axilla.
He presented with 2 weeks of a rapidly growing mass in the right axilla that he says grew to the size of a plum.
Was also having constitutional symptoms at presentation.
FISH was performed and it was positive for a rearrangement involving MYC.
He had a bone marrow biopsy performed on [**2110-8-28**] and this revealed a hypercellular bone marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis, no histomorphologic evidence of leukemia, or lymphoproliferative disorder was seen.
He does report that  he did have intrathecal chemotherapy twice.
He was diagnosed with HIV in [**2101**], when he seroconverted and had an acute [**Year (4 digits) 18617**] illness.
He was started on a trial of an intensive anti-retroviral regimen at diagnosis, but ultimately had to stop these medications due to elevated amylase.
He denies any history of opportunistic infections and did not have low CD4 until chemo initiation.
He reports a history of hepatitis A and is a hepatitis B carrier.
2) history of asthma:Moderate-to-severe bilateral paraseptal and central lobular emphysematous changes predominantly in the upper lobes.
3) depression, anxiety 4) anal herpes 5) low testosterone state 6) h/o left shoulder fracture in a scooter incident 7) anal fistula repair ([**2109**])    Social History: SOCIAL HISTORY: Lives with family in [**Last Name (un) 79914**] right now.
RRR, S1/S2, no mrg LUNG: Inspiratory and exp wheezes bilaterally, no focal crackles or rhonchi.
Using abdominal and SCM accessory muscles ABDOMEN: nondistended, +BS, nontender in all quadrants, no rebound/guarding, no hepatomegaly, mild spelnomegaly just belwo costal margin.
Influenza virus RNA (A/H1/H3/B) not detected  IMAGING CXR [**6-24**] IMPRESSION: Findings are most likely due to infection including PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 18617**], bacterial or atypical pneumonia.
Diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities and scattered areas of focal consolidation has a wide differential which includes infectious (aspiration, PCP or [**Name10 (NameIs) 18617**]), inflammatory (drug reaction from bleomycin) or neoplastic (multifocal BAC) etiologies.
Followup after therapy can be obtained to ensure resolution of these lesions.
Hilar and mediastinal adenopathy may be reactive or may reflect Burkitt's lymphoma recurrence and should be followed to resolution.
Fusion of the left transverse process of L5 to S1 increases risk for degenerative disc disease at L4-L5.
Mild hepatosplenomagealy.
Severe apical bullous emphysema.
There is gradual progression of bibasilar opacities with particular worsening between [**6-24**] and [**6-26**], but currently with no evidence of progression, but significant presence of the abnormalities.
Large bullous emphysema in the upper lungs.
Brief Hospital Course: 52yoM with history of HIV and Burkitt-like lymphoma presenting with 1 week of nightsweats and two days' of worsening shortness of breath, now with high fevers and imaging demonstrative of bilateral groundglass and patchy consolidative opacities.
#) Atypical Pneumonia.
Acuity of onset of SOB, bilateral infiltrates in addition to high spiking fevers is most suggestive of infectious etiology.
He was initially started on levofloxacin, vanco and cefepime for broad coverage.
The following day, he had an increased oxygen requirement up to 6L NC when initially was satting mid 90s on 2L.
Fever curve trended down and antibiotics were discontinued and he remained onlevoflxacin for 10 day course with no further fevers, afebrile >72 hours on levofloxacin alone prior to discharge.
# Vent Status: He was intubated for broncoscopy.
#) Hypotension/ Hypothermia: Pt was hypotensive in MICU partially attributed to propofol sedation and possible interaction of midazolam with ritonavir, but very concerning given what is likely an ongoing infectious process in lungs.
Central venous access was attempted in the RIJ vein under ultrasound guidance.
#) History of Burkitt-like lymphoma.
CT torso demonstrates 2 cm hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy, thought by oncology to represent reactive lymphadenopathy.
LDH only mildly elevated, no other evidence of tumor lysis.
#) Elevated INR/PTT.
No evidence of DIC on other labs.
#) Chronic renal insufficiency.
Combivent 18-103 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Two (2) puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Disp:*1 bottle* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis Atypical Community Acquired Pneumonia  Secondary Diagnosis HIV history of Burkitt like Lymphoma Depression/Anxiety Asthma   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, afebrile, oxygen saturations mid 90s on 3L nasal cannula   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath, fever, and low oxygen levels.
You were treated with antibiotics and your symptoms improved.
You were intubated (placed on a breathing machine) for assistance with breathing and for a bronchoscopy, which took samples of fluid from your lungs to determine what kind of infection you had.
We did not find the exact cause of your infection but you did not have any more fevers and your oxygen levels and breathing improved on antibiotics.
We added atovaquone to prevent PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2**]  Please return to the ER or call your primary oncologist if you develop worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, fever>101, chills, lightheadedness, diarrhea, or any other concerning symptoms.
