Patient states episode begain with one dark melanotic stool on friday night, no BRBPR.
He then had 4 episodes on saturday and 3-4 episodes of very loose melanotic stools today.
He does report two episodes of LH within the past two days when standing, no syncope.
2 18g IVs placed and patient sent to the ICU for monitoring overnight with GI planning for scope in the AM.

Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 98.4   BP: 143/62   P: 92   R: 14 96% RA General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema .
CXR ([**3-20**]): CONCLUSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2192-11-8**] the ventricular response to atrial fibrillation has slowed from 136 to 87 beats per minute.
The ST-T wave changes in leads V4-V6 are prominent and are new, possibly secondary changes due to left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Dilated ascending aorta.
GI: EGD ([**3-21**]): IMPRESSION: - non-obstructive Schatzki's ring - Medium hiatal hernia - Ulcer in the stomach body on the greater curvature.
- Erosion in the stomach body compatible with erosive gastritis - Erosions in the first part of the duodenum compatible with mild duodenitis - There was evidence of a submucosal lesion in the gastric antrum.
- Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum .
Capsule Endoscopy ([**3-23**]): pending  Brief Hospital Course: In brief, Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 56M with hx of HTN, Hypertriglyceridemia, Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma (s/p short bowel resection), Atrial Fibrillation on coumadin who presented from home with melena and anemia, was found to have likely UGIB [**3-14**] gastritis/duodenitis, now hemodynamically stable.
# GI Bleed: Likely gastritis/duodenitis in the setting of anticoagulation.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] presents with complaint of melena and acute anemia with HCT drop from 40.4 ([**2195-12-12**]) --> 28.5 (on admission) ---> 22 (MICU).
Pt received 6 blood transfusions total.
EGD revealed gastritis/duodenitis/?ulcers, which could be the source of bleeding.
# Chronic Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient has hx of A-fib and is on Coumadin (CHADS2=1).
# ECG changes:  Patient with new ECG changes likely in setting of strain with acute anemia.
# Peripheral Neuropathy: Lyrica continued on discharge.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: gastrointestinal bleeding likely secondary to gastritis/duodenitis .
hypertension hypertriglyceridemia chronic atrial fibrillation lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma   Discharge Condition: hemodynamically stable, Hct ~32 for >48 hours   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with dark stools.
