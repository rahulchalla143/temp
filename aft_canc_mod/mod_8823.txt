Admission Date:  [**2130-4-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2130-4-19**]  Date of Birth:   [**2081-6-15**]       Sex:  F  Service:  PLASTIC SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Ms. [**Known lastname 1968**] is a patient with a left breast mass and presents for excision of the breast lesion and reconstruction with a TRAM flap.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Insulin-dependent diabetes, breast cancer invasive ductal carcinoma, sarcoidosis, hepatitis C with chronic cirrhosis and mitral valve prolapse  MEDICATIONS:  Cozaar 25 mg by mouth once daily, insulin NPH  HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the first day of her hospital stay, the patient was taken to the operating room, where she underwent an uncomplicated left simple mastectomy, left axillary sentinel node biopsy, and TRAM flap to the left breast, as performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 364**].
In the perioperative period, the patient had significantly inadequate urine output as well as the development of a left abdominal wall hematoma.
Given the patient's multiple medical problems and concern over the patient's urine output, the patient was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for observation.
The patient also had an increase in her serum creatinine to 1.8, at which point a Renal consult was also obtained.
The Renal team felt this was most likely pre-renal hypoperfusion in the setting of relative hypotension during extended period in the operating room.
These circumstances likely exacerbated issues associated with her chronic underlying diseases.
During this time, the patient was also receiving intravenous Kefzol for antibiotic, and for pain control, the patient had been receiving an epidural, however, given the setting of her postoperative complications, the epidural was discontinued and a patient-controlled analgesia was begun.
The apparent hematoma which had been forming on the anterior abdominal wall continued to remain soft and decreasing in size and presented no further problems or complications.
The patient's Foley catheter was discontinued, and the patient continued to make adequate urine with spontaneous voiding.
