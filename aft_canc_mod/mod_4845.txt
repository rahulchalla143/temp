(100% L)  His EKG showed a sinus tachycardia w/o repol abnormalities.

It is not approved for diagnosis of acute HIV       infection.
In symptomatic acute HIV infection (acute retroviral syndrome), the       viral load is usually very high (>>1000 copies/mL).
It is recommended that any NEW positive HIV-1 viral load result, in       the absence of positive serology, be confirmed by submitting a new       sample FOR HIV-1 PCR, in addition to serological testing.
CMV IgG ANTIBODY (Final [**2180-3-10**]):       POSITIVE FOR CMV IgG ANTIBODY BY EIA.
CMV IgM ANTIBODY (Final [**2180-3-10**]):       NEGATIVE FOR CMV IgM ANTIBODY BY EIA.
INTERPRETATION:  INFECTION AT UNDETERMINED TIME.
A positive IgG result generally indicates past exposure.
Infection with CMV once contracted remains latent and may reactivate       when immunity is compromised.
Greatly elevated serum protein with IgG levels >[**2170**] mg/dl may cause       interference with CMV IgM results.
DIRECT INFLUENZA B ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2180-3-9**]):       Negative for Influenza B.  TOXOPLASMA IgG ANTIBODY (Final [**2180-3-10**]):       NEGATIVE FOR TOXOPLASMA IgG ANTIBODY BY EIA.
Reference Range:  No antibody detected.
Negative results do not rule out B. burgdorferi infection.
Patients       in early stages of infection or on antibiotic therapy may not produce       detectable levels of antibody.
Patients with clinical history and/or       symptoms suggestive of lyme disease should be retested in [**2-16**] weeks.
TOXOPLASMA IgM ANTIBODY (Final [**2180-3-10**]):       NEGATIVE FOR TOXOPLASMA IgM ANTIBODY BY EIA.
INTERPRETATION:  NO ANTIBODY DETECTED.
SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON REQUEST..     Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2180-3-12**]):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN CLUSTERS.
Blood Culture, Routine [**3-8**] (Final [**2180-3-14**]):    NO GROWTH.
**FINAL REPORT [**2180-3-14**]**     Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2180-3-14**]):    NO GROWTH.
FLAIR abnormality in the subcortical left occipital lobe with some focal overlying cortical involvement and no evidence of associated hemorrhage, restricted diffusion, or definitive enhancement.
The differential diagnosis includes low-grade primary glial neoplasm and tumefactive demyelination.
Unremarkable MRA of the head and neck without evidence of tumor vascularity, shunting, or flow-limiting stenosis.
Sinus disease as described above, the activity of which is to be determined clinically.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No echo evidence of endocarditis.
Brief Hospital Course: 26 year old RH man with an unremakable PMH who was last seen in his USOH in the early am (prior to going to work) and then at noon (normal conversation with his wife over the phone) p/w two subsequent seizures with associated leukocytosis, fever, non-blanching erythematous rash, conj.
hemorrhage, rhabdomyolisis, ARF, transaminitis with a L parietal lesion on MRI representative on edema w/o [**Year/Month/Day **] enhancement.
DDx included an underlying primary CNS malignancy with edema, leading to seizure and subsequent rhabdomyolisis, ARF, though given fever and rash an infectious process (viral HSV, EBV, HHV-6) could not be definitively ruled out.
In addition, a metastasis from a lymphoma in  this patient was also considered.
OSH LP negative and viral studies w/ cultures pending.
Patient treated empirically with Acyclovir/CFTX/Vancomycin as per ID recommendation for possible coverage of HSV encephalitis (atypical presentation), possible meningitis and/or endocarditis with vancomycin.
No stigmata of endocarditis were noted and TTE was negative.
Neuro-oncology was consulted who recommended outpatient follow up for biopsy of brain tumor  after normalisation of high CK and improvement in general medical condition.
EEG was obtained and showed spikes nearly Q1-2mins w/o NCSE, thus patient was continued on Dilantin with goal of > 10 corrected for albumin, which was later changed to keppra which was continued as outpatient.
No further respiratory issues were noted, after trasnfer to floor.
CK on arrival ~ 18K treated with moderate IVF rate, and rose to peak of 100 K.  Pt.
Cr peaked at 1.9 and microscopic analysis was notable for granular casts concerning for tubular renal injury.
Cr at time of discharge was 4000s, with rapid downward trend.
w/ fever on presentation and recurrence on HD2.
BCx, UCx were pending and CXR was negative for infection.
There was opacification of sinuses, however patient did report URI sx prior to presentation.
Disp:*9 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Left parietal area wedge shaped brain lesion ?
neoplastic Rhabdomyolyis- recovering aspiration pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for evaluation of seizure.
You were found to have a wedge shaped lesion on left side of brain.
You had a condition called rhabdomyolysis which results from injury to muscles.
You were found to have aspiration pneumonia for which you recieved/will be recieving antibiotics for total duration of 1 week.
You were started on a medicine called keppra for control of seizures which you will be taking even after discharge.
