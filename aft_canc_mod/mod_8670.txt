On morning of admission (as per HPI) she experienced acute SOB-->respiratory distress.
This was thought to be [**2-4**] to flash pulmonary edema vs. mucus plug vs. PNA.
Given h/o noncompliant diet(s/p sardines) and incomplete dialysis 2 days prior to admit, flash pulm edema seems most likely diagnosis.
2 L fluid taken off at emergent HD upon transfer to MICU with symptomatic improvement.
PNA - however, f/u CXR showed improvement and was thought to be more consistent with atelectasis.
After extubation, patient was stable from respiratory standpoint, with no further SOB or need for supplemental oxygen.
* 2) ESRD - [**2-4**] DMII; aneuric; admitted with volume overload secondary to dietary noncompliance(ate can of sardines [**11-2**]).
She was then continued on her outpatient M/W/F dialysis schedule and followed by renal team without further complications.
* 3) CAD - demand ischemia w/ trop elevated during this admission (to 0.4); likely high in the setting of renal failure.
She is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on discharge for further evaluation/treatment of cardiac disease.
However, at onset of respiratory distress there was concern for ?
Neuro evaluated patient and felt that the episode was likely due to her tenuous cardiorespiratory/fluid status and not CVA.
Patient was anticoagulated on admission (coumadin started 8 weeks ago after pt had stroke on asa/plavix).
She received to units of blood during emergency dialysis after episode of respiratory distress, which increased hct from 28.5 ->33.2.
Coumadin was held during admission for GI procedures and there was discussion with PCP as to whether to continue coumadin on d/c given acute drop in HCT.
Colonoscopy was performed on [**11-7**] with polypectomy (adenoma per path report) diverticulae, but no other gross abnormalities.
Bx of antrum of stomach on EGD on [**11-8**] revealed chronic inactive gastritis.
No evidence of active bleeding per GI studies.
U/S on [**11-4**] without evidence of  DVT [**11-4**].
Her fistula remained patent with no needle placement issues during admission.
Likely [**2-4**] to nerve damage, but considered sympathetic nerve dystrophy syndrome.
* 7) OPHTHALMOLOGIC ISSUES: The patient with a history of glaucoma and cataracts.
Fluid overload resulting in flash pulmonary edema, respiratory distress, and intubation 2.
Acute blood loss Secondary Diagnosis: 1.
End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis since [**2167**].
Coronary artery disease, status post right coronary artery stent in [**8-6**] with thrombus, in-stent restenosis in [**10-6**] elevation MI.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 40%, +1 mitral regurgitation.
Type 2 diabetes complicated by nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy status post laser photocoagulation.
History of transient ischemic attack 15 years ago with slurred speech and unsteady gait per the patient.
Peripheral vascular disease, status post bilateral femoral-popliteal and left femoral-tibial bypass.
Cervical spondylosis with myelopathy status post anterior cervical diskectomies infusion C3-6 complicated by postoperative dysphagia.
H/o rectal CA in [**2163**] s/p poly removal.Last colonoscopy in [**2167**] with 1 polyp removal, 3 others bx   Discharge Condition: stable  Discharge Instructions: Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet Fluid Restriction: 28 ounces Please call your PCP or return to the ED IMMEDIATELY if you develop shortness of breath, chest pain, increase lower extremity swelling, or other worrisome symptom.
No food/drink after midnight prior to test.
