Admission Date:  [**2152-12-3**]     Discharge Date:  [**2152-12-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2106-6-1**]     Sex:  M  Service:  O-Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46 year old man with a history of renal cell carcinoma that is widely metastatic, status post multiple rounds of Il-2, who was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2152-12-3**] for an upper gastrointestinal bleed.
Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] was recently admitted to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**2152-10-28**] until [**2152-11-6**] after he had a large upper gastrointestinal requiring 28 units of packed red blood cells and 23 units of fresh frozen plasma.
His bleed was due to esophageal and gastric varices secondary to portal vein compression by metastatic tumor.
During the hospital stay, the patient had complications including transient intubation, development of an aspiration pneumonia, transient acute renal failure secondary to dye induced nephrotoxicity, and an increased alveolar arterial gradient in the setting of deep vein thrombosis, status post a failed attempted at an inferior vena cava filter placement due to concern for pulmonary embolism.
After discharge, the patient was in a compensated state of health until [**2152-12-1**], when he had an episode of bloody emesis times one.
The next day, he had a second episode of hematemesis and presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital.
The patient initially had borderline hemodynamic instability with a heart rate in the 100s and a blood pressure of 98/42.
Intravenous octreotide was started and emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed which revealed grade IV esophageal varices that were banded.
He then had recurrence in [**2149**] and underwent Il-2 again.
Another complication included portal vein compression proximal to the liver, complicated by portal hypertension, portal hypertensive gastropathy with gastric varices and esophageal varices.
Another complication included deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history is negative for renal cell carcinoma.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient was a visibly jaundiced man in no acute distress with scleral icterus.
He had flat neck veins.
His heart rate was tachycardiac with no murmur, rub or gallop.
He also had portal hypertensive gastropathy with gastric varices.
He also had stigmata of recent bleeding.
His hematocrit stabilized at around 31 and he had no further episodes of bleeding, namely, hematemesis or melena.
He had a stent revision with a larger stent placed and the old stent removed on [**2152-12-3**].
This resulted in better bile drainage and a drop in his bilirubin to 6.9 at the time of discharge.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Metastatic renal carcinoma.
Gastric and esophageal varices, status post upper gastrointestinal bleed.
