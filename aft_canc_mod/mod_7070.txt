Admission Date:  [**2130-2-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-2-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-4-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**] Chief Complaint: nausea, fatigue, doing poorly at home  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 59 year-old female with Crohn's disease status post multiple bowel resections with ileostomy, on chronic TPN, as well as smoldering myeloma followed without treatment, with a history of metastatic squamous cell esophageal cancer, presents with worsening fatigue and draining enterocutaneous fistula.
Patient has not received any treatment for esophageal cancer given her poor performance status.
She continues to experience pain in her left shoulder and both legs.
She also has intermittent abdominal pain.
Review of Systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Review of Systems: GEN: No fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
HEENT: No headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
CV: No chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
PULM: No shortness of breath, or wheezing.
GUI: No dysuria or change in bladder habits.
This became more severe in [**2129-11-9**] and on [**2129-12-5**] EGD was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 452**], and this showed segmental continuous granularity, friability, and erythema of the mucosa in the distal esophagus from 25-30 cm.
Biopsy of distal esophagus revealed markedly atypical squamous epithelium highly suspicious for squamous cell carcinoma.
On [**2129-12-23**] endoscopic ultrasound showed an ulcerated, infiltrative circumferential mass at 30 cm causing partial obstruction, close to 2 cm in maximum depth.
By EUS criteria this was T3N1 with evidence of invasion beyond the muscularis layer.
Two peri-tumoral nodes were noted which were not sampled as they could not be sampled without traversing the primary esophageal lesion first.
Biopsy revealed invasive squamous cell carcinoma.
On [**2130-1-3**] PET/CT showed FDG-avid mass (SUV 15.4) involving the distal [**12-12**] of the esophagus through the level of the GE junction, with adjacent FDG avid soft tissue possibly representing a nodal mass.
There was FDG avidity (SUV 5.6) in ill-defined retrotracheal soft tissue, concerning for second site of esophageal involvement or nodal conglomerate.
There was a posterolateral subpleural right upper lobe mass, 1.9 x 2.2 cm, concerning for pleural metastasis (SUV 14.9).
In the right femur, 4 cm below the femoral neck was markedly increased FDG avidity (SUV 9.4) in marrow without correlative lesion on CT.  On [**2130-1-12**] she had CT-guided biopsy of the right upper lobe mass revealing squamous cell carcinoma, felt to be metastatic from her esophageal primary.
She is also followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12354**] who has recommended palliative radiation, possibly with concurrent chemotherapy, for her dysphagia.
OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: # Crohn's disease with history of resections and short gut syndrome, ileostomy, on chronic TPN since [**2124**] # smoldering myeloma, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] since [**8-17**], with stable paraprotein.
# arthritis # osteoporosis and history of multiple thoracic compression fractures # history of MSSA disseminated infection s/p admission to the [**Hospital1 **] in [**2124**] with septic pulmonary emboli, left iliopsoas abscess, T9 paraspinal abscess, and T7-9 vertebral osteomyelitis s/p percutaneous pigtail drain, parascapular abscess  Social History: She lives with her husband of 33 years as well as their 25 year-old son.
Pulm: No dullness to percussion, CTAB no crackles or wheezes Abd: soft, nontender, ileostomy bag in place with stool, midline fistula with surrounding erythema and no active drainage Extremities: wwp, no edema.
Multifocal large hypoenhancing areas in the kidneys and spleen, compatible with multifocal abscess from septic emboli.
New large heterogeneously enhancing lesion in the left hepatic dome, adjacent to and contagious from the known esophageal cancer at the GE junction, likely represents interval aggressive tumor infiltrate.
New large cystic lesion anterior to the new hepatic mass, could represent an abscess or a biloma.
This cystic lesion is amenable to image-guided drainage/aspiration.
Interval marked enlargement of bilateral adrenal lesions, compatible with aggressive metastatic growth.
No free air.
Interval marked enlargement of the right lower lobe squamous cell carcinoma site.
Marked interval interstitial thickening in the posterior aspect of left lower lobe, likely represents lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
However, if the patient had interval radiation therapy, this could also represent post-radiation changes.
Ill-defined heterogeneous esophageal tumor at the GE junction, incompletely assessed.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 year-old female with Crohn's disease status post multiple bowel resections with ileostomy, on chronic TPN, as well as smoldering myeloma followed without treatment, with a history of metastatic squamous cell esophageal cancer, presents with worsening fatigue and draining enterocutaneous fistula.
She was found to have profound hyperkalemia and on  CT abdomen/pelvis there were multiple abscess as well as growing metastases noted.
She had a ruptured enterocutaneous fistula that had been draining for the past few weeks.
She had crackles on the left.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was covered for sepsis with broad spectrum antibiotics and ID was consulted.
On evaluation she appeared to have a mixed picture of distributive and cardiogenic shock.
