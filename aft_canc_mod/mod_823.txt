Cortical irregularity and periosteal reaction in the shaft of the proximal phalanx of the great toe, is concerning for osteomyelitis.
Suspected minimally impacted fracture at the base of the middle phalanx of the left second toe.
Continued healing of the proximal left metatarsal shaft fracture with callus formation and obscuration of the fracture line.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 10936**] was admitted with hypotension and intubated in the ED for altered mental status, though there was some report that he had throat swelling after an injection of dexamethasone.
Cardiology thought that this was most likely secondary to demand and given his 3vd he would not benefit from catheterization, they recommended calling cardiac surgery to redisscuss a CABG as he had been turned down for unclear reasons in the past.
He had an infected toe which grew MSSA and was amputated by vascular surgery with placement of a wound vac.
He was seen by physical therapy, with a plan for weight bearing while wearing a post operative shoe, and continued outpatient physical therapy.
He was not having increased stool output, and it was unclear whether this was asymptomatic carriage.
For his Coronary Artery disease, his simvastatin was increased to 80mg daily from 20 mg daily for cardioprotective purposes while revascularization surgery continues to be considered.
