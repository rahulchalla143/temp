Admission Date:  [**2163-10-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2163-10-25**]   Service:  [**Hospital1 **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 89-year-old male with history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, end stage renal disease on hemodialysis who presented to an outside hospital with hypoglycemia.
Apparently, on the morning of presentation he had a reported glucose of 10, though did not have the typical symptoms of hypoglycemia such as diaphoresis.
His EKG showed new ST depressions in leads V3 through V6.
He makes minimal urine at baseline.
Diabetes mellitus.
End stage renal disease on dialysis.
Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].
In general awake, alert and appropriate in no acute distress.
Neck: No jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardia, but regular, S1, S2 with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities reveal no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
He has an albumin of 2.9, positive acetones and INR of 1.2.
This is evident by his anion gap acidosis, ketones in blood and urine as well as extremely elevated glucose.
He was started on insulin drip and aggressive hydration which lead to quick resolution of his symptoms.
There thoughts were that he probably had hyperglycemia as well as concomitantly occurring metabolic acidosis which could have been out of starvation or other metabolic processes.
He had no further episodes of hypoglycemia and only occasional episodes of glucose between 300 and 400.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  During his MICU stay, the patient had an episode of several hypotension with blood pressure about 70/palp.
The catheterization there revealed a stenotic lesion in the LDA about 90% which was stented.
It also revealed an RCA lesion of 70 to 80% which was nothing to intervene upon on.
A following bedside echo following the MI revealed an ejection fraction of about 20%.
There are several options in the future such as doing a stress test to see whether the patient has symptomatic pain from the defects versus purely medical management versus cardiac catheterization in the future if the patient improves symptomatically.
We decided to obtain on the day of discharge, another cardiac echocardiogram now that his cardiac function has somewhat stabilized to assess his ejection fraction and to determine the for systemic coagulation if he has a low ejection fraction.
He continued to complain of abdominal pain, however those are believed to be due to urinary obstruction which was relieved after straight catheterizing him and finding 1000 cc in his bladder.
He had diarrhea during hospital course, but numerous samples were sent for Clostridium difficile and all of those were negative.
We obtained several imaging studies of his belly all of which revealed no evidence of obstruction or lesions to explain abdominal pain.
It must be noted that abdominal pain waxed and wane together with his mental status.
Additionally, consultation was obtained with Speech and Swallowing Service.
They performed a video swallow which revealed possible aspiration with some liquids, therefore their recommendation included thick and nectar consistency type diet while awaiting for improvement in his mental status and overall function before advancing to thin liquids.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  On initial presentation, the patient had occasional fevers as well as a white count, however search for infectious source was unrevealing.
He received a full seven day course of Ceftriaxone for possible pneumonia during his stay on the regular medical floor.
The only evidence of infection was an equivocal urinalysis which revealed some white blood cells and bacteria.
He received a short course of Ciprofloxacin for potential urinary tract infection.
There was no other source of an infectious process and his fevers resolved.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  During his stay on the Medical Floor, the patient was found to have a significant amount of right shoulder pain.
An x-ray revealed no signs of fracture or dislocation.
The consultation with the Orthopedic Service was obtained and their opinion was that this is most likely a chronic rotator cuff injury.
Apparently he receives very high doses of benzodiazepine, Haldol and other medications effecting his mental status.
Also such medications were discontinued on the Medical Floor and he had mild improvement in mental status.
A consultation with the .................... Service was obtained and there feeling is that this is most likely medication induced contusion and delirium which will hopefully resolve as time goes by.
An EEG was obtained which showed changes consistent with toxic metabolic picture and no evidence of seizures.
His electrolytes remained well-controlled and there are no acute issues from a renal standpoint.
Note, patient makes small amounts of urine, but has somewhat reluctant to void and had required Foley catheter for this purpose.
Diabetes mellitus.
Status post acute myocardial infarction.
Right shoulder rotator cuff chronic injury.
End stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
