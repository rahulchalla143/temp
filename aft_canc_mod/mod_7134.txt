BPs 118/83 initially, now 111/74 GEN:The patient is in no distress and appears comfortable SKIN:No rashes or skin changes noted HEENT:No JVD, neck supple, No lymphadenopathy in cervical, posterior, or supraclavicular chains noted.
Non-distended, and soft without tenderness EXTREMITIES:no peripheral edema, warm without cyanosis NEUROLOGIC: Alert and appropriate.
No pronator drift.
There is persistent cardiomegaly with central pulmonary vascular congestion and relative indistinctness of the hilum.
Bilateral pleural effusions are again noted with fissural fluid noted on the right.
No pneumothorax is seen.
Bibasilar atelectasis is also stable.
IMPRESSION: Mild CHF with bilateral pleural effusions.
TTE [**2159-3-17**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiographic examination is recommended to assess mitral valve morphology, exclude a vegetation, and better evaluate severity of mitral regurgitation.
Dilated and at least mildly hypokinetic right ventricle.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Severe pulmonary hypertension.
Mitral regurgitation severity has increased, and pulmonary pressure is more severe.
Progressive decrease in the pleural effusions, especially on the right.
Mild bibasilar atelectasis persists.
ECG [**2159-3-18**] The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation with a moderate ventricular response and occasional ventricular ectopy.
Right bundle-branch block.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2159-3-16**] atrial fibrillation has appeared.
Left atrial abnormality.
Right bundle-branch block.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2159-3-16**] no diagnostic interim change.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan 84 y/o gentleman with history of diastolic CHF and hypertension who presents with acute CHF exacerbation initially requiring non-invasive ventilation as well as new 3+MR now improved satting mid 90s after aggressive diuresis.
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC DIASTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE - Pt was admitted with acute on chronic diastolic heart failure decompensation with [**Date Range 113**] on admission showing worsening moderate to severe MR [**Name13 (STitle) 104756**] with [**2159-1-18**].
He had no evidence of new ischemia by ECG or biomarkers.
Diuresis with lasix IV boluses was initially limited by low BPs with SBPs in 70s-80s but BP improved throughout hospital course as he was diuresed with lasix gtt.
He bumped his creatinine on day of discharge from 1.7 to 2.3, so regimen was downtitrated to torsemide 60mg PO BID with no metolazone.
# MR: New 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 113**] concerning for ischemic MR vs volume overload.
Continued diuresis as above and attempted to optimize medical management as patient does not want surgery or any invasive procedures.
# H/O DVT ON ANTICOAGULATION: Coumadin initially held due to supratherapeutic INR but then restarted at home doses.
# MYELOMA: Have been holding dexamethasone secondary to fluid overload .
# CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE: Creatinine trended up through admission likely from heart failure and decreased renal perfusion as well as diuresis.
# HEMATURIA: Likely from elevated INR.
# BPH/Bladder spasms- Patient started on pyrimidine 100mg PO TID for 3 days which improved spasms.
# FEN : Pt with hypokalemia while being diuresed.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO at bedtime as needed for constipation.
