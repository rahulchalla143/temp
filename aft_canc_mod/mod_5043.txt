Admission Date:  [**2194-5-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2194-6-5**]   Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath w/ exertion- new x2 weeks  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Flexible bronchoscopy, diagnostic.
History of Present Illness: delightful 83- year-old gentleman with COPD and pulmonary fibrosis with a long history of smoking.
The CT scan during this visit demonstrated a new 15 mm spiculated right upper lobe nodule.
He denied any significant dyspnea other than these acute episodes that he has in the Spring; however, his wife reports that his wife is winded with minimal exertion, including climbing a flight of stairs.
He does play golf on a daily basis but does so with a cart.
He reports being reasonably active and not being particularly limited by shortness of breath.
A preoperative PET scan demonstrated activity within the lesion but not elsewhere within the body.
Additionally, I discussed the likelihood of performing a wedge excision for diagnosis and therapy given his extensive pulmonary disease and baseline dyspnea.

PTX INDICATION: Status post chest tube removal, evaluate for pneumothorax.
No definite pneumothorax is identified.
There is pleural effusion layering along the lateral aspect of the right lung and stable parenchymal opacities within the right lung and at the left base.
Left pleural effusion is unchanged.
Stable subcutaneous emphysema within the right chest wall.
No definite evidence of pneumothorax following chest tube removal.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Stable patchy opacities within the right lung and left base.
INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:  The patient is a delightful 83- year-old gentleman with COPD and pulmonary fibrosis with a long history of smoking.
The CT scan during this visit demonstrated a new 15 mm spiculated right upper lobe nodule.
He denied any significant dyspnea other than these acute episodes that he has in the Spring; however, his wife reports that his wife is winded with minimal exertion, including climbing a flight of stairs.
He does play golf on a daily basis but does so with a cart.
He reports being reasonably active and not being particularly limited by shortness of breath.
A preoperative PET scan demonstrated activity within the lesion but not elsewhere within the body.
Additionally, I discussed the likelihood of performing a wedge excision for diagnosis and therapy given his extensive pulmonary disease and baseline dyspnea.
We found no endobronchial lesions and found no anatomical abnormalities.
We positioned the patient supine but we were unable to extend his neck due to degenerative joint disease.
We prepped and draped his neck and chest in the usual sterile fashion.
We made a 1 cm transverse incision 2 cm cephalad to the sternal notch and dissected down to the pretracheal plane.
There was an extensive amount of fatty tissue within the mediastinum and vicinity of the lymph nodes.
We found small lymph nodes in the 4-R position and biopsied two separate areas and sent them for frozen section analysis.
We performed extensive dissection in the left paratracheal region, identifying the course of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve and dissecting down to the esophagus but found no identifiable lymph nodes to biopsy.
The mediastinoscope was placed as deep as it would go and it was barely within reach of the subcarinal space, due to the lack of extension of his neck and the depth, I was unable to safely biopsy the subcarinal lymph nodes.
On frozen section, there was no evidence of malignancy and, therefore, we closed the wounds after achieving meticulous hemostasis.
We dissected down to the pleura and encountered a very thick fibrotic pleura that we were unable to break through but there was no pleural space to dissect within.
We, therefore, aborted the idea of a thoracoscopic approach.
We were able to develop the fissure between the upper and superior segment of the lower lobe and we developed a fissure between the middle and the lower lobe.
We then palpated the tumor which measured approximately 3 cm on palpation.
It was located in the periphery at the junction between the anterior and apical segments.
We mobilized the pleura around the anterior apical and posterior hilum, sweeping the lung off the hilum as much as possible to gain mobility for a large wedge excision.
We then used the US Surgical thoracoscopic stapler with a 6 cm long, wide mouth thick tissue staplers to perform a wedge excision down to near the hilum.
We performed the wedge excision with several firings of the stapler and sent specimens for pathological analysis.
Our discussion was centered around the fact that a lobectomy would run the risk of pushing him into respiratory failure and worsening his dyspnea.
I was particularly concerned by the fact that he had dyspnea on several occasions and at least one of them, requiring hospitalization.
His wife reports that he is quite dyspneic around the house and is concerned about his breathing.
His pulmonary function tests demonstrated restrictive lung disease and he has a history of pulmonary fibrosis and COPD.
We resected the right paratracheal lymph node in a complete packet with sharp dissection.
I then also freed the lower lobe as much as I could from the chest wall, without performing a counter incision.
We placed multiple intercostal nerve blocks with a total of 20 cc of [**11-26**] strength Marcaine with epinephrine.
Patient admitted to SICU post-op for hypotension and low urine output requiring fluid boluses and neo gtt.
