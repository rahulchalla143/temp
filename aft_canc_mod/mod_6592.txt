He began having left-sided weakness at home, prompting him to go to an OSH for evaluation.
He was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraparenchymal hemorrhage involving the frontal and right parietal lobe and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation.
On [**2184-5-12**], he had respiratory distress overnight off of O2 (increased RR) and required 4 L O2 to achieve normoxia.
Per nursing, has been having increased secretions with periodic desaturations, which resolve with suctioning.
Repeat CXR was significant for worsening pulmonary edema.
Has had worsening LE edema after his MI in [**2182**], requiring an increase in lasix dose (40->80 mg daily) and was recently on metolazone with good effect.
Currently, the patient reports slight difficulty breathing, but denies any chest pain, dizziness/LH.
Denies any cough, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, or dysuria.

Contrast: MAGNEVIST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 70 year old man with subarachnoid and intraparenchymal bleeds REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please evaluate for underlying mass as source of hemorrhage.
HISTORY: 70-year-old male with subarachnoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhages after fall.
TECHNIQUE: Axial T1, FLAIR, T2, gradient echo, and diffusion-weighted images as well as sagittal T1-weighted images were acquired prior to administration of IV contrast.
MR HEAD: A 3.7 x 1.8 cm right frontal parafalcine intraparenchymal hemorrhage with mild surrounding edema is grossly unchanged in appearance compared to the CT performed earlier on the same day at 10:33.
Regions of subarachnoid hemorrhage are also noted in the bilateral frontal and parietal lobes, also unchanged.
A small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage is noted in both occipital horns.
In addition, a tiny focus of gradient echo signal drop-out in the right occipital lobe (9:10) likely represents a focus of microhemorrhage; no other foci of microhemorrhage are seen.
There is no shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or loss of the basal cisterns.
There is no region of diffusion abnormality to suggest underlying infarction.
No region of abnormal enhancement is seen to suggest underlying mass.
No MRI signs of venous sinus thrombosis are seen.
Decreased T1-weighted signal in the clivus may relate to myelodysplastic changes or an infiltrative process.
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells remain well aerated.
Right frontal parafalcine intraparenchymal hemorrhage, multiple foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage, and tiny bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage unchanged.
Tiny focus of susceptibility artifact in the right occipital lobe may represent focus of microhemorrhage.
No definite evidence of underlying mass, infarct or vascular abnormality.
Decreased T1 signal in the clivus may represent myelodysplastic changes in this patient with history of myelodysplastic syndrome.

FINDINGS: Again a right posterior frontal intra-axial hematoma is identified with mild surrounding edema.
The edema is slightly more prominent than the previous study.
There is no mass effect or midline shift seen.
Again subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular blood is identified which has not significantly changed.
No significant new areas of hemorrhage seen.
IMPRESSION: Slightly more prominent hypodensity due to edema surrounding the intra-axial hemorrhage in the right posterior frontal lobe along the midline.
This could be secondary to evolution.

However, the cranial vertex is relatively spared with respect to motion artifact, and numerous foci involving the frontal and parietal lobes bilaterally demonstrate subarachnoid hemorrhage in the sulci interdigitating with the gyri.
Although there is surrounding edema, there is no apparent mass effect or midline shift of normally midline structures.Parenchymal hematoma right cingulate gyrus may also be present.
Although no fracture is definitely identified, severe motion degradation limits the ability to detect a fracture.
IMPRESSION: Subarachnoid hemorrhage involving the frontal and parietal lobes bilaterally.
Because of significant motion artifact, it is not possible to assess for fracture.

INTERPRETATION: Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in 8 views demonstrate abnormal decreased ventilation of the left lung base which corresponds to the CXR finding of the elevated left hemidiaphragm.
Chest x-ray shows decreasing pulmonary edema, no pleural effusion and persistent abnormal elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
The above findings are consistent with an inconclusive study as no perfusion phase has been performed.

# Fever/UTI - Blood cultures and urine cultures were taken.
Chest x-ray was most consistent with fluid overload rather than pneumonia as was subsequent clinical course.
# Respiratory distress - due to CHF.
# Acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure An echo was performed - results above.
# Subarachanoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhages: he was initially monitored in the neurosurgical ICU and blood pressure controlled with IV nicardipine.
Serial CT and clinical exam suggest resolution; most recent CT scan showed mild cerebral edema without shift of any midline structures and resolving blood with resorption of intraventricular blood.
# DM: - glyburide initially held in case pt would require any procedures that would require him to be NPO; restarting at 5mg on discharge  # seizure disorder: cont outpatient dilantin dose.
# Transient hematuria was noted likely from foley trauma.
