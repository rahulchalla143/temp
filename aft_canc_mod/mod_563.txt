PPM (DDD) placement   History of Present Illness: 84 y/o F with severe AS (0.8), chronic lymphoma, DVT on coumadin, asthma who p/w falls X 1 month.
Baseline ECG reveals bifasicular block with prolonged PR.
Attempt at RIJ for temp wire unsuccessful.
Pt became hypotensive requiring max dose dopa and neo gtt's.
Due to ventricular ectopy, weaning dopa first.
Past Medical History: 1) Aortic stenosis: last echo [**6-16**] with EF > 55%, severe AS (worse than prior echo) 2) Rheumatoid arthritis (followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Rheum, on methotrexate) 3) asthma 4) HTN 5) LLE DVT 6) Pneumonia 7) Anemia of chronic disease 8) CAD 9)h/o thrombocytopenia of unknown etiology (negative HIT, and SRA) 10) Areflexive bladder (requiring chronic foley)   Social History: Lives with daughter.
HEENT:  PERRL, MMM, JVP elevated ~11cm, firm hematom R neck.
CVR:  RRR, III/VI cresendo decresendo murmor at RUSB radiating to carotids.
[**2148-11-30**] Head CT no ICH or mass .
Moderate size hematoma in the subcutaneous tissues of the right groin.
No pelvic or intra-abdominal hematoma.
Large hernia containing two separate segments of colon.
Mild circumferential thickening along part of the ascending colon partly located within the abdomen and within the right inferolateral abdominal wall hernia with mild adjacent stranding compared to previous CT. No sign of mechanical obstruction.
Possibilities would include an area of focal segmental congestion or even colitis depending on clinical correlation.
Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 3.9 cm transverse unchanged.
Moderate right basal pleural effusion and minor associated right posterobasal atelectasis.
ECHO [**2148-12-2**] There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (estimated [**Location (un) 109**] ~0.6 cm2 but LVOT velocity estimation is technically limited) .
There is no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: This is a 84 year old female with severe AS (0.8), chronic lymphoma, DVT on coumadin, asthma who p/w s/p fall and complete heart block.
# Pump - Recieved 3U FFP.
Attempt at RIJ for temp wire unsuccessful.
Pt became hypotensive during attempt at RIJ temp wire requiring max dose dopamine and neosynephrine gtt's.
Hypotension was thought to be secondary to increased vagal tone with pressure and manipulation at the RIJ.
Patient became hypotensive and required fluid boluses and resumed on dopamine ggt temporarily after removal of right femoral sheath and right groin hematoma was seen on CT.
# Rhythm - Noted to have 8 sec run of non-conducted P's (assymptomatic).
Baseline ECG reveals bifasicular block with prolonged PR.
##Hematomas - Patient developed multiple hematomas at access sites including RIJ, left forearm, right groin and left chest (pacer site).
Bleeds stopped with pressure bandages, FFP and vit K. Abdominal CT showed right groin bleed and no RP/intrapelvic bleed.
## UTI:  Enterococcus 100K, PROVIDENCIA RETTGERI 10-100K on ucx.
## Anemia: Labs consistent with iron def anemia.
anemia concerning for GI origin and should have outpt workup.
Patient received blood after decreased Hct after RIJ attempt, R femoral groin cordis removal and left chest hematoma at pacer site.
Initially patient was started on coumadin with heparin bridge however had pacer bleed and so coumadin and heparin were held given bleeding risks.
Head scan negative.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Last Name (un) **] Center - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: High-degree heart block  Secondary Diagnosis: Chronic lymphoma Aortic stenosis Hx of DVT Lymphoma Rheumatoid arthritis Iron deficiency anemia   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: Please take medications as prescribed.
Since you have aortic stenosis, please have your primary care physician adjust your lasix does accordingly.
You have iron deficiency anemia and have been started on iron repletion.
If you have any chest pain, fevers/chills, loss of consciousness or any worrying symptoms please call your primary care physician or come to the emergency room.
