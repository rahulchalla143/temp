CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Critical tracheal narrowing from mediastinal mass; transferred from [**Hospital6 **] for rigid bronchoscopy and stents.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old Caper Verdean male with hypertension, asthma, many pack year smoking history, asbestos exposure, and positive purified protein derivative with known right apical cavitary lesion (being treated since [**2126-10-1**]) who was admitted to [**Hospital6 **] on [**2127-1-29**] with a productive cough, increased shortness of breath, and bilateral neck swelling.
He originally had a positive purified protein derivative in [**2126-9-1**] with an initial negative chest x-ray.
Then, in [**2126-10-1**], he had scant hemoptysis and weight loss.
An x-ray revealed a new 5-cm mass with lucency suggestive of cavitation in the right apex with hilar retraction and fullness in the paratracheal area.
He was seen back in the [**Hospital 45727**] Clinic on [**1-13**], and the chest x-ray showed no change in the cavitation.
Then, on [**1-29**], the patient presented to [**Hospital6 14430**] complaining of a persistent productive cough times three months with greenish white/yellow sputum with occasional scant blood mixed in, increased shortness of breath, and increased dyspnea for two weeks, dysphagia times three months, and bilateral neck swelling times a few weeks.
He also complained of chest pain with left arm radiation.
He ruled out for a myocardial infarction with serial cardiac enzymes and was started on levofloxacin for "bronchitis."
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   On review of systems, he complained of a 50-pound to 60-pound weight loss over a two to three month period, a persistent productive cough, neck swelling, dysphagia, shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, nausea, and vomiting.
He hospital course at [**Hospital6 **] was notable for ruled out for a myocardial infarction by enzymes.
Then, several hours after his exercise treadmill test, he had increasing shortness of breath and respiratory distress with "signs of seizure activity."
After intubation, 150 cc of blood came out of the patient's left naris and 100 cc of bright red blood per endotracheal tube.
An emergent bronchoscopy revealed distorted tracheal anatomy at the level the carina, and no visualization of the right main stem bronchus due to mass compression and clot covering the area.
Brushings for cytology were sent which ultimately revealed large-cell carcinoma of the lung.
Of note, with labile blood pressures with a systolic blood pressure of 200/110 and was started on a Nipride drip.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Lungs with rhonchi diffusely.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
No hepatosplenomegaly appreciated.
Upper extremity edema of 2+, trace lower extremity edema.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  [**Hospital6 **] chest x-ray on [**1-28**] revealed persistent increased opacity of the right apex with linear densities and apparent cavitary lesions, a soft tissue nodule, within this cavity, and a meniscus sign.
A computed tomography at [**Hospital6 **] on [**1-29**] revealed a 2.7-cm X 1.8-cm thick wall cavitary lesion within the right apex, several stellate fibrotic bands radiated from this lesion inferiorly.
There was an irregular 3.5-cm X 1.5-cm lesion in the posterior portion of the right upper lobe in surround ground-glass opacity in the right upper lobe, and a 7-mm nodule in the posterior right base.
No pleural effusions.
No pericardial effusions.
Positive lymphadenopathy in the paratracheal, prevascular, precarinal, and subcarinal spaces.
A exercise treadmill stress test on [**1-31**] revealed positive chest pain.
No electrocardiogram changes.
A computed tomography tracheostomy was performed for planning of rigid bronchoscopy with stents; which revealed a large speculated mass in the right upper lobe with cavitations and extensions to pleural surface, hilar lymphadenopathy.
Masses posterior to right carina and main stem bronchi, and two necrotic lymph nodes in right upper and mediastinal left supraclavicular, two bibasilar atelectasis with scarring containing nodular components, and three scattered tiny nodules in the lunch parenchyma.
A flexible bronchoscopy was performed which revealed possible communication between the right upper lobe lesion and trachea, severe narrowing of the right main stem bronchus.
First staging computed tomography was obtained which showed no hemorrhage, and no enhancing lesions, and normal [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white differentiation.
A computed tomography of the abdomen showed no metastases.
Because of concern over infection control, given that the patient traveled to [**Country 3587**] since the last time he ruled out for tuberculosis, acid-fast bacillus times three were obtained; which were negative.
The patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy with stents on [**2127-2-6**] which revealed large amounts of paratracheal edema.
It was felt that he was unlikely an extubation candidate given severe paratracheal edema without tracheostomy placed.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The differential diagnosis for the right upper lobe cavitary mass included malignancy alone, tuberculosis, and aspergillosis.
Tuberculosis was unlikely given the negative acid-fast bacillus smears and negative cultures; however, that he was always on anti-tuberculosis medications during this time complicated matters as well as recent travel to [**Country 3587**].
Due to the rising AST and ALT and low likelihood for tuberculosis given negative acid-fast bacillus smears, his INH and rifampin were discontinued.
The patient was initially placed on levofloxacin and Flagyl for postobstructive pneumonia; however, he continued to spike fevers and was changed to AmBisome on [**2127-2-6**] due to aspergillus growing out of bronchial washings from sample taken here at [**Hospital1 69**] as well as a computed tomography cavitary lesion highly suspicious for aspergilloma.
The patient also with heavy amounts of sinus discharge, which were negative for aspergillosis.
He was continued on AmBisome per Infectious Disease recommendations and continued to spike temperatures to 103.8.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient continued with hypotension which responded to fluids.
A cardiac echocardiogram was performed which revealed findings consistent with infiltrative cardiomyopathy.
A cosyntropin stimulation test was performed which revealed no evidence of renal insufficiency.
