MRI at that time revealed enhancing mass consistant with GBM.
She had a series of focal motor seizures after her diagnosis.
She also received 2 cycles of temozolomide chemotherapy, and is now undergoing edotecarin chemotherapy (s/p 24 cylces q 3 weeks - last dose on [**2159-9-19**]).
She also recently had an MRI on [**2159-9-17**] which showed no change from previous/no tumor progression.
For the last several weeks she has been having increasing right sided weakness associated with frequent falls.
She has been maintained on her current chemotherapy regimen, Decadron, and Keppra without changes.
During breakfast, she began to have rhythmic shaking of the right hand and wrist.
Her husband called the [**Name (NI) 746**] Clinic to report these symptoms and was advised to administer an extra dose of Keppra and Decadron.
She did not respond to questions or commands appropriately.
A head CT was done which showed left frontoparietal edema with a calcified mass, there was no evidence of bleed.
Of note, she has not had a seizure since her tumor resection in [**2157**].
At that time her seizures consisted of focal motor seizures of the right lower extremity.
Per her husband, she has not had a fever/chills, headache, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea or vomiting, or diarrhea.
She has not missed any doses of her medications.
She has not had any recent head trauma despite her frequent falls.
Hypertension 4.
Hypothyroidism 5.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease 6.
Dyslipidemia 7.
Family History: Coronary artery disease Sister had a "benign cysts in her brain" requiring surgical excision   Physical Exam: Vital Signs:  Temperature: afebrile; blood pressure 94/42; heart rate 57; respiratory rate 12; and oxygen saturation 100% **examination performed off propofol x 15 minutes**  Gen: Intubated, moving left arm and leg spontaneously HEENT:  NC/AT, ETT and OG tubes in place Neck: supple, no bruit CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, 2/6 SEM Lung: Clear to auscultation anteriorly Abd: +BS soft, non-distended Ext: no edema, multiple ecchymoses with skin breakdown on right arm and leg.
Neurologic examination: Mental status: Unresponsive, does not open eyes to verbal or tactile stimulation.
Grimaces to noxious stim and moves her left arm and leg spontaneously.
Withdraws left arm and leg and moves antigravity spontaneously; no spontaneous movement on the right.
Bilateral periventricular white matter hypodensity, likely related to tumor and treatment effects.
Clustered calcifications in the superior left frontal lobe, possibly in the surgical bed.
No acute hemorrhage.
There is a left subclavian Port-A-Cath with tip in the lower superior vena cava, unchanged in position from the prior study.
There is likely a tiny right pleural effusion.
Linear atelectasis is present in the left lower lobe.
No areas of consolidation are present.
Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There were no areas of persistent focal slowing although encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.
There were no epileptiform features.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 74 year old woman with a history of left frontoparietal GBM, s/p surgery and XRT, on chemotherapy who presented to OSH with status epilepticus.
The etiology of her seizure may have been progression of the underlying disease (GBM/edema) or lowering of seizure threshold from infectious or metabolic disturbances.
Ativan was given PRN for partial seizures, observed on [**2159-10-2**].
After discussion between Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] and the family on [**2159-10-3**] it was decided not to treat the glioblastoma further.
During the following day the stridor improved but she had difficulties clearing her secretions.
A CXR was suggestive for aspiration pneumonia for which the patient was started on Levaquin and Flagyl.
She was able to mount a low grade fever, but her WBC trended down.
Another source of infection might have been her skin (multiple lacerations) or peripheral lines.
