Admission Date:  [**2154-9-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-10-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-2-2**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**] Chief Complaint: Unresponsive  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 82yo female with past medical history of asthma was admitted from an OSH with hypotension, altered mental status, and likely metastatic brain lesions.
On the day prior to admission, patient reported the sudden onset of a severe headache for which she took approximately 7 advil tablets.
Shortly afterwards, she reportedly developed increasing lethargy, vomiting, weakness, and subsequently became unresponsive.
Patient was noted to be unresponsive and was intubated.
Shortly after intubation she was noted to be hypotensive with SBP in the 50s and she was started on dopamine gtt with improvement in SBPs to 70-80s.
Initial head CT at [**Hospital3 **] noted a hyperdense lesion in the right posterior temporal lobe with suggested intraparenchymal hemorrhage versus metastatic lesion.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evaluation of possible intraparenchymal bleed.
Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], radiology reviewed her imaging and found her images most consistent with a metastatic lesion, concerning for a primary adenocarcinoma.
Clinically patient remained unresponsive despite having not received any sedation in the last 6-8 hours prior to arrival.
Neurosurgery evaluated patient and found her exam concerning for unresponsiveness and posturing, although with no other acute surgical issues.
Regarding likely metastatic lesion, unclear that patient has ever had age-appropriate cancer screening, including mammogram or colonoscopy.
PEEP 5 Gen: lying in bed, responsive to irritative stimuli, NAD HEENT: dry mucous membranes NECK: Supple, No LAD, No JVD CV: RR, NL rate.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops LUNGS: CTA, BS BL, No W/R/C ABD: Soft, NT, ND.
No HSM EXT: No edema.
dusky extremities but warm SKIN: No rashes NEURO: intermittently arousable.
Pertinent Results: [**2154-9-27**] Blood Cx pending x 2 [**2154-9-28**] Urine Cx pending  OSH STUDIES: - CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis - [**2154-9-27**] - no abnormality identified within the chest, abdomen, or pelvis to account for loss of consciousness; mild dependent atelectasis within the lung; abdominal examination is normal.
- CT Head - [**2154-9-27**] - 11mm round hyperdense focus centered at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white junction of the posterior right temporal lobe, seen in association with vasogenic edema.
hemorrhagic metastasis or focal parenchymal bleed.
[**Hospital1 18**] STUDIES: - ECG [**2154-9-27**] - NSR at 85 bpm with no ST changes - Head CT - [**2154-9-27**] - 1.
1.1-cm hyperdense lesion with surrounding edema seen in the right temporal lobe, suggestive of metastatic lesion.
Linear hyperattenuation seen at the posterior right lateral ventricle, possibly representing venous filling, however, assessment for hemorrhage is limited by intravenous contrast.
- Head MRI - [**2154-9-28**] - final read pending - CXR - [**2154-9-28**] - final read pending   Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an 82 yo F with asthma admitted with hypotension and altered mental status found to have profound metabolic acidosis (lactate 7).
She was also found to have a brain lesion, with possible hemorragic component based on imaging at the OSH.
It was thought that the patient may have had a seizure from the brain lesion.
The neurosurgeons evaluated the lesion and felt that a brain biopsy of the lesion would be necessary for diagnosis.
