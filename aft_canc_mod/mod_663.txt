Admission Date:  [**2154-1-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-1-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2114-3-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: doxycycline  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: vision loss  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2154-1-3**]: Right Pterional Craniotomy and resection of cyst   History of Present Illness: 39 year old woman returns to clinic today after being evaluated by opthamology and endocrinology.
She was seen one month prior for evaluation of an incidental finding of a suprasellar mass.
It was noted that this lesion had significant mass effect on the optic chiasm and that her prolactin level was known to be elevated.
Formal visual field testing revealed bitemporal hemianopic defects.
She states that she feels much more energized since starting these medications but continues to have excessive thirst and urination.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Visual fields- lateral and upward/lateral restricted face symmetric, tongue midline no pronator drift MAE's with 5/5 strengths incision- well healing, dissolvable sutures  Pertinent Results: [**2154-1-3**] MRI Head: IMPRESSION: Suprasellar cystic lesion with intrasellar extension and peripheral rim enhancement.
Differential diagnosis can include a Rathke's cleft cyst or cystic craniopharyngioma.
The lesion is close to components of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] and causes mass effect on the optic chiasm.
Status post craniotomy with evidence of pneumocephalus, and a small amount of blood along the surface of the brain in the right frontal and temporal regions.
POst-procedural pneumocephalus causing mass effect with displacement of midline structures and effacement of sulci in the right cerebral hemisphere.
Postoperative sequelae in the right temporal lobe are again noted.
A small focus of restricted diffusion in the right temporal lobe might represent a small infarct.
Residual cystic area behind the pituitary stalk could represent a small residual lesion.
Surgery was without complication.
Post op head CT was stable and revealed no hemorrhage or obvious infarct.
She responded appropriately with decreased urine output and normalization of sodium (145 in AM [**1-4**]).
Post op MRI was performed and revealed post op changes and residual cystic area behind the pituitary stalk.
Urine output remained stable with a slight increase toward the end of 12 hours.
Her Na remained WNL and on the day of discharge her Na is 143.
On [**1-8**] PT and OT worked with the patient and recommended d/c home, no services.
At the time of discharge she is tolerating a regular diet, ambulating without difficulty, afebrile with stable vital signs.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
