Admission Date:  [**2173-5-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-5-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2117-7-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Altered speech/ headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2173-5-25**]: R frontal craniotomy for tumor resection   History of Present Illness: 55 yo F with hx of abrupt onset of garbled speech who presents as transfer from OSH with CT/MRI showing new diagnosis R frontal mass.
Per patient, she has a history of migraine headaches but has not had any in the last number of years.
These have not been associated with any neurological changes but in conjuction with these headaches has been having fleeting episodes of "out of body experiences" during which she describes this vague sensation of not being present where she is.
Now today, patient notes that she had another "out of body experience" that was then followed by an episode in front of her class (pt is a teacher) of garbled and mumbling speech that lasted probably around 20-30 seconds.
She was taken to [**Hospital6 **] where a CT head showed a R frontal mass with midline shift.
An MRI head showed Poorly enhancing 48 x 43 x 49 cm mass in the right frontal be with associated mass effect and subfalcine and right uncal herniation and extension of parenchymal edema into the right temporal lobe.
No anticonvulsant medications given as there is concern for subclincal seizures.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Low-attenuation lesion with thin rim calcification seen in the greater omentum and subcapsular region of segment VI liver.
Differential diagnosis includes peritoneal inclusion cyst vs echinococcal disease.
Large fibroid uterus, similar in appearance to previously described reports from [**2167**].
Old L2 and sternal fractures as described.
Functional MRI [**2173-5-20**]: IMPRESSION: Functional MRI of the brain, demonstrating the expected activation areas during the movement of the hands, feet, and tongue with activation areas adjacent to the mass lesion during the movement of the tongue.
CT head Post-Op Post right frontotemporal craniotomy and right frontotemporal lesion resection with post-surgical changes in the vicinity.
No acute hemorrhage.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: There is a relative small amount of acute hemorrhage at virtually the entire margin of the resection cavity.
Mixed solid and cystic lesion in the anterior omentum, with partial calcification and hemorrhage, and mild peripheral enhancement suggestive of fibrotic component.
The etiology is unclear, and may represent enteric duplication cyst or other unusual, likely benign cystic lesion or sequelae of atypical infection.
Small lesion at the periphery of hepatic segment VI, likely representing chronic subcapsular hematoma.
No abnormal enhancement.
No evidence of intra-abdominal metastasis.
Expected post-operative changes with persistent 7-mm leftward shift of normally midline structures.
Continued followup with MRI after resolution of post-operative changes is recommended.
Anterior-inferior margin of the resection site demonstrates a region of slow diffusion, new from the pre-operative study and not accounted for by the marginal hemorrhage seen on susceptibility sequence; this is concerning for post-surgical cytotoxic edema in the adjacent parenchyma.
Brief Hospital Course: 55 y/o F presented to OSH with 1 and a half months of headache and dysarthria.
Head CT revealed a R frontal lesion and patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further neurosurgical evaluation.
A CT torso was done which showed low-attenuation lesion with thin rim calcification seen in the greater omentum and subcapsular region of segment VI liver and fibroid in the uterus, no other metastasis.
MRI head showed a poorly enhancing 4.8x4.3x4.9 R frontal mass with mass effect.
Patient is scheduled for a funtional MRI and will go to the OR for resection of lesion on [**5-25**].
A post-op Head CT showed expected post-operative changes.
on [**5-26**] She underwent MRi scan which showed expected post-operative changes as well and she was transferred to the floor.
Hepatology was consulted and they felt that there was nothing to do, no need for furhter tests or biopsy and no need for follow up with a hepatologist.
