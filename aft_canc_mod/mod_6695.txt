Admission Date:  [**2111-8-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2111-9-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2068-11-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: hematopoeitic stem cell transplant  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 42 year old woman with M5 acute myeloid leukemia with complex cytogenetics and refractory to multiple chemotherapeutic regimens.
Persistently chemoablated bone marrow since that time.
She has developed likely leukemia cutis over last couple of weeks.
Had an episode of emesis following line insertion today, but is otherwise doing well.
This progressed to include pleuritic chest pain and she was seen in an OSH.
She was diagnosed with acute monocytic leukemia, M5, and had complex cytogenetics.
Her course was complicated by pulmonary infiltrates which were likely leukemia, fever/neutropenia with negative evaluation and thought to be possible drug fever and pericardial effusion/tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis.
The etiology of her pericardial tamponadewas not determined, though there were atypical cells in the fluid (thought to be reactive lymphocytes).
Her day +27 marrow was consistent with regenerating marrow without clear evidence of leukemia.
On [**2111-6-8**], she was noted to have a new rash on her torso and biopsy demonstrated leukemia cutis.
Bone marrow examination on [**2111-6-10**] demonstrated generalized dysplasia with 5% blasts.
Father: Fatal myocardial infarction 50's.
NECK:  Supple, without adenopathy.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, no clicks, murmurs or rubs, question slightly tachycardic.
SKIN: 1 cm RLQ lesion consistent with leukemia cutis.
IMAGING: [**9-4**] RUQ DOPPLER; FINDINGS: The liver demonstrates no focal or textural abnormality.
There is no biliary dilatation.
Color Doppler son[**Name (NI) **] was performed, demonstrating patent left portal, right anterior and right posterior portal veins, SMV, IVC, and hepatic veins, with direction appropriate flow.
[**9-7**] RUQ ULTRASOUND: RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The liver is normal in echogenicity, without focal lesions.
The gallbladder is partially distended without wall edema, gallstones, biliary sludge, or pericholecystic fluid.
There is no abdominal ascites.
Evaluation of hepatic vasculature was suboptimal, due to patient's inability to breath-hold.
However, Doppler waveforms demonstrate slightly increased phasicity.
Normal liver, without evidence of ascites.
Partially distended gallbladder, without acute cholecystitis.
Slightly increased pulsatility could be compatible with hepatic [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusive disease in the correct clinical setting.
[**9-7**] CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS: CHEST: Left internal jugular line terminates in the distal SVC, and a right large-bore catheter extends from the internal jugular vein into the deep right atrium.
There is mild interstitial and alveolar pulmonary edema, with smooth interlobular septal thickening and perihilar ground-glass opacities.
Moderate left and small right simple pleural effusions have developed.
There are few hazy peripheral opacities in both lungs, most compatible with subsegmental atelectasis, although aspiration or early multifocal infection cannot be excluded.
There is a trace pericardial effusion.
Note is made of a small sliding hiatal hernia.
ABDOMEN: There is mild simple ascites throughout the abdomen and pelvis.
Laparoscopic gastric band surrounds the gastric fundus, without evidence of obstruction or leak.
There are no air-fluid levels or transition points to indicate obstruction.
There is mild fatty infiltration of the liver.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation.
Kidneys are normal in size, without stones or hydronephrosis.
Mild bilateral perirenal edema is noted.
Mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are not pathologically enlarged.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are identified.
There is diffuse body wall edema.
Volume overload with pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, ascites, and anasarca.
Opacification in the retrocardiac region persists, consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.
Hazy opacification bilaterally is consistent with substantial elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was a 42 year old female with a history of acute myelogenous leukemia with complex cytogenetics and failed remission efforts who was admitted to the hospital to undergo an allogeneic stem cell transplant.
She was conditioned with total body radiation and cytarabine.
She received the transplant on the floor, but a few days later she had worsening liver and renal function with rising bilirubin, INR, and creatinine.
Patient was transferred to the ICU following an episode of hypotension during which she was unresponsive.
Her antibiotic coverage was broaded and her BP improved to the point where she was no longer pressor dependent.
She remained stable throughout the day, however it was noted that she was having increased work of breathing.
Bone marrow transplant service was notified and her steroids were increased to try to treat a possible engraftment syndrome/cytokine storm.
There was concern for [**Last Name (un) **]-occulsive disease due to her transplant.
A RUQ ultrasound did not show ascites, venous occlusion, or hepatomegaly.
However, she did have new right-sided abdominal pain for the first time during the admission.
She developed profound acidosis and was again required vasopressors for blood pressure support.
Eventually, patient's clinical course continued to deteriorate, and eventually and another code blue was called for PEA arrest (pulseless electrical activity).
