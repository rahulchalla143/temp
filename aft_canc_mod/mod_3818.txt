The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis, hypothyroidism, anxiety, depression and gastric reflux including regurgitation.
She developed initially severe headaches in [**2142-7-16**].
At that time, she had a MRI that showed a hyperintense lesion on the left frontal brain with invasion of the left middle frontal gyrus.
The case was discussed, and it was felt there was a high suspicion that this represented an intrinsic glioma.
The patient was therefore counseled and consented and was booked electively to go for left frontal lobe partial resection to obtain a tissue diagnosis as the basis for further treatment.

On her first post-op day she was found to be neurologically intact, she was transferred to the surgical floor, tolerated a regular diet and ambulated without difficulty  A Post-Op MRI was completed: Within the left frontal lobe, there is a surgical defect with blood products within it.
There is minimal enhancement along the margins of the defect.
There is also left cerebral dural enhancement.
T2-weighted images demonstrate increased signal intensity in the brain surrounding the surgical cavity, and extending up to the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
No other areas of signal abnormality are observed within the brain.
