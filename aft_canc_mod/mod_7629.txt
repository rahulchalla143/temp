Calcific aortic valve disease with minimal stenosis/mild regurgitation.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
RUQ US-IMPRESSION: Distended gallbladder with gallbladder wall edema, pericholecystic fluid with a small amount of sludge and tiny stones visualized in the gallbladder.
There is however no evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Although cholecystitis cannot be fully excluded, although these findings are likely related to inflammatory changes from adjacent pancreatitis.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was an 89 year old female who suffered from transfusion dependent myelodysplastic syndrome that was transferred from [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**8-10**].
She had initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) **] with abdominal pain where she was found to have pancreatitis.
In their emergency department, she developed respiratory distress and was intubated necessitating transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
She was followed by the ERCP team who believed the pancreatitis was due to a passed gallstone and that no intervention was necessary.
Following one platelet transfusion, the patient became difficult to ventilate and had a drop in her BP.
CXR showed new opacities bilaterally and effusions.
Following extubation the patient immediatly began to show signs of increased work of breathing.
