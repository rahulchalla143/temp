Admitted to Bay State Hospital, where cause of abdominal pain not found; however, imaging showed new RUL lung mass.
Course complicated by osteomyelitis of the sternum, with a long course of antibiotics.
There had been no evidence of recurrence on followup as recently as fall of [**2102**].
3 vessel CABG in [**10-10**] DVT in [**2094**] History of depression Type II DM GERD hyperlipidemia s/p bilateral inguinal hernia repair s/p lipoma resection   Social History: He lives with his son.
Family History: Significant for mother with cancer (uncertain type) and DM, brother with [**Name2 (NI) 27339**] cancer, another brother with CAD and DM.
Physical Exam: AF, 104, 145/68, 98%%5L Gen:  laying in bed, non-toxic appearing HEENT  NCAT, MM slightly dry Neck supple, JVP 6 cm Chest scattered rales in RUL, R lung base, otherwise clear CVS tachy without murmur Abd benign Extrem Tr edema Neuro A & O x 3   Pertinent Results: OSH Studies: .
RUL mass extending from the hilum to the chest wall, most likely malignancy, malignant LAD with poss postobstructive PNA 2.
Peripheral ill-defined nodules likely due to metastatic disease, but could potentially be granulomatous/infecious.
Loculated L pleural effusion.
Left sided calcific pleural thickening.
Hypodense lesion in the liver maybe due to metastatic disease.
Small intra-abdominal paraaortic nodule of indeterminate signifance.
[**2-5**] CT abd/pelvis: No urolithiasis or obstructive uropathy.
L renal cyst.
[**2103-2-8**] Bone Scan: Findings concerning for diffuse osseous metastases.
[**2103-2-8**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]: No sign of an enhancing intracranial mass to indicate the presence of a parechymal metastatic disease.
[**2103-2-9**] Biopsy Pathology: Combined invasive carcinoma with a squamous component and an undifferentiated component with marked cell size variation.
The tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin cocktail (squamous component greater than undifferentiated component) and synaptophysin (undifferentiated component) and negative for LCA and chromogranin.
[**2103-2-17**] CXR: New right upper lobe opacity which likely represents pneumonia.
[**2103-2-17**] Head CT: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
No significant change allowing for differences in technique.

# Lung cancer - The patient was found to have a new right lung mass, which was revealed to have small cell and non small cell features on pathology.
A bone scan revealed diffuse osseous mets.
# mental status changes/hypotension - The patient had an episode of acute mental status changes, unresponsiveness, and hypotension which was likely multifactorial in etiology.
It was likely partly due to medications (narcotic pain medications among them) as well as a possible contribution of infection (pneumonia as described below).
There was no intracranial hemorrhage by CT scan, no brain mets by recent MRI.
The patient was found to be hypercarbic, though it was difficult to say whether this is a cause or result of MS changes.
# Hypercarbic resp failure: The patient had an elevated CO2 on blood gas in association with the altered mental status and hypotension described above.
This was likely secondary to medication effect, with the respiratory failure being secondary to sedation.
# Pneumonia - The patient had a new RUL infiltrate on chest xray, likely a postobstructive vs. aspiration pneumonia.
# abdominal pain - The patient presented with abdominal pain of unclear etiology, and had a negative CT abd/pelvis at an outside hospital.
Possible etiologies included metastatic disease, hypercalcemia, constipation, or a combination of these.
He was given bowel regimen for constipation, treatment for hypercalcemia as below, and pain medications.
He ultimately had good control of his pain, as well as resolution of his constipation.
# hypercalcemia - Calcium was 11.2 on admission, likely related to the patient's malignancy.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease (ferritin >[**2097**]).
This was likely hypervolemic hyponatremia, in the setting of IVF and blood products.
Sodium returned to [**Location 213**] after a small dose of lasix.
# h/o CAD: Currently asymptomatic.
Cardiac enzymes were negative when checked in the ICU in the setting of hypotension and mental status changes as above.
# h/o depression: Paxil had been discontinued in [**Month (only) **], but then was restarted at the outside hospital, and was continued here.
