WOUND CULTURE (Preliminary):    No significant growth.
S/P HEART CATH, HYPOTENSIVE, HEMATOMA ON CT  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 67 year old man w/R fem hematoma ?active bleed; s/p R groin entry for cardiac cath 2 wks ago; now hypotensive REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: duplex ultrasound of R fem art RIGHT FEMORAL VASCULAR ULTRASOUND  INDICATION: 67-year-old with right groin hematoma, question active extravasation, rule out pseudoaneurysm.
This corresponds with intramuscular hematoma noted on CT. No significant vascular flow or connection to the femoral vessels is demonstrated.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pseudoaneurysm.
Hematoma noted .
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of abdomen and pelvis were obtained without administration of oral or intravenous contrast.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is dependent atelectasis at lung bases bilaterally.
Thoracic and abdominal aorta contain extensive calcification.
There is nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland.
There is fusiform aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal aorta, measuring up to 3.4 cm in AP diameter.
There is no free air and no free fluid in the abdomen.
There are no pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph nodes.
There is diverticulosis of the descending colon without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
Small bowel loops are normal, given lack of oral contrast.
There is no retroperitoneal hematoma.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is extensive diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
The air in the bladder is presumably related to recent instrumentation.
There is no free fluid and no pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes.
There is no pelvic hematoma.
Within the adductor muscle compartment of the right medial thigh, there is a 8.7 x 5.4 cm high attenuation collection, consistent with an intramuscular hematoma.
Active extravasation cannot be excluded on the basis of non-contrast study.
BONE WINDOWS: Demonstrate no concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Degenerative changes are noted in the lumbar spine.
Large intramuscular hematoma within right adductor compartment; active extravasation cannot be excluded.
No retroperitoneal hematoma.
Diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
Atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta with fusiform dilatation up to 3.4 cm.
FEMORAL VASCULAR US RIGHT  [**2120-3-15**] 12:52 PM  FEMORAL VASCULAR US RIGHT  Reason: please assess for right cath site hematoma, pseudoaneurysm,  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 67 year old man s/p heart cath through right groin with thigh hematoma and unstable HCT.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please assess for right cath site hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, interval change of thigh hematoma INDICATION: 67-year-old man with recent right groin catheterization, assess right groin for pseudoaneurysm or hematoma.
FINDINGS: Again seen in the right groin is a heterogeneous mass consistent with a hematoma.
Appropriate vasculature with no evidence of a pseudoaneurysm or an AV fistula.
Echo: There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior, inferolateral and basal inferoseptal severe hypokinesis/akinesis.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation secondary to tethering and restricted leaflet motion is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
At this rate, probable atrial tachycardia with 2:1 block versus slow atrial flutter.
There is low limb lead voltage.
The presence of inferior myocardial infarction cannot be ruled out.
Right bundle-branch block.
On the previous tracing of [**2110-6-16**] inferior myocardial infarction was noted.
However, the atrial tachycardia with 2:1 block and right bundle-branch block are new.
TRACING #1    Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 86 [**Telephone/Fax (3) 17442**]/[**Medical Record Number 17443**] -141    Brief Hospital Course: 67 year old male with CAD s/p CABG and recent stent to SVG-PDA 10 days ago admitted from PCP's office with right leg pain and hypotension.
# Hypotension.
The source of his hypotension was a right femoral hematoma, as he just had a cardiac catheterization done the week before, and radiographic imaging revealed a right femoral hematoma without fistula or pseudoaneurysm.
Other etoiologies of hypotension, including cardiogenic shock from stent thrombosis, septic shock, or pulmonary embolism, were considered in the differential but were not supported by the history, physical examination, or other laboratory/imaging data.
# Right groin hematoma.
he was discharged from the hospital on [**3-7**], and presented to his PCP with hypotension on [**3-12**].
Right groin ultrasound showed a hematoma without fistula or pseudoaneurysm.
CT abdomen/pelvis ruled showed a large intramuscular hematoma without retroperitoneal bleeding.
A repeat right groin ultrasound on [**3-15**] showed the hematoma was stable and not enlarging.
#:Bilateral foot pain: The patient presented with bilateral foot pain, right greater than left.
Pain felt like a sharp ache, and was reproduced with palpation over the balls of his feet.
The patient reports his pain began during his previous hospitalization in early [**Month (only) 547**], after someone manipulated his feet in the hospital.
The pain began before he underwent cardiac catheterization during his previous hospitalization.
His pain is thought secondary to plantar fasciitis as the patient is quite obese, and his legs are tremendously swollen, with pitting edema on top of preexisting lymphedema.
He had bilateral foot x-ray's prior to discharge but the results were not yet available.
He was started on metoprolol once his hematocrit stabilized, and there was no evidence of active bleeding.
# Pump: Bedside echo done in ED shows EF 45 with HK of the inferorior inferior, inferolateral and apical walls consistent with mutlivessel coronary disease, not significantly changed from [**2117**].
After resuscitation in the ED with  6 L IVF and 3 units packed RBC's, the patient developed moderate pulmonary edema and significant lower extremity edema.
paroxysmal afib while on telelmetry during this hospital stay.
His creatinine remained stable once he was fluid resuscitated, indicating that his acute renal failure was prerenal.
Only found in [**12-1**] bottles, and not found from peripheral cultures.
Lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right groin intramuscular hematoma within adductor compartment Coronary Disease Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure Myelodysplastic Syndrome Atrial Fibrillation Osteoarthritis   Discharge Condition: Good, tolerating PO.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with low blood pressure, and found to have a right groin hematoma.
Bleeding from your hematoma stopped, and your blood pressure and hematocrit normalized.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other symptom.
