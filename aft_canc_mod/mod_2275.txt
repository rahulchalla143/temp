History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 42459**] is a 73-year-old gentleman who recently presented with obstructive jaundice and was found to have a mass in the head of his pancreas by ultrasound.
Endoscopic ultrasound and ERCP were performed and a diagnosis of malignant pancreatic adenocarcinoma was made through a biopsy.
The ultrasound suggested a large mass which was adjacent to the portal vein.
I was unable to get better axial imaging due to the fact that he had chronic renal insufficiency from diabetes and, therefore, we could not get an MRI or CT scan.
he underwent staging laparoscopy a week ago, which was clean and showed no evidence of liver metastases or carcinomatosis.
Intraoperative ultrasound at that time showed a significant sized mass of pancreatic head with apposition to the portal vein, but no more distinction could be understood.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on [**2112-9-29**] for treatment of a cancerous head of pancreas mass.
On [**2112-9-29**], the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, double bypass consisting of choledochojejunostomy with a Roux-en-Y formation and gastroenterostomy, excision of stomach lesion, placement of gold fiducial seeds for CyberKnife radiation therapy, and open cholecystectomy, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
The planned Whipple procedure was abandoned when it was clear during surgery that the patient had unresectable pancreatic cancer.
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO with an NG tube, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter and a JP drain in place, and an intra-thecal Morphine injection and either Morphine or Dialudid IV PRN for pain control.
Due to hypotension and low urine output late on POD#0 and early POD#1, the patient received a total of 1 liter NS fluid bolus, Albumin 25g IV, and Hespan 500mL IV.
Post-operative pain was initially well controlled with intra-thecal morphine and IV pain medication PRN.
He pain control was consistent and adequate.
The patient subsequently voided without problem.
At the time of discharge on POD#6, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a diabetic regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
