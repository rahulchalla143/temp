[**2188-10-27**]: Small-to-moderate right pneumothorax with apical lateral and basal component has increased since [**10-25**] following removal of the right pleural drain.
Subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall is smaller and there is no appreciable right pleural fluid.
Small left pleural effusion is stable.
[**2188-10-25**]: There is again seen a small right apical pneumothorax.
There remains soft tissue emphysema within the right lower chest wall.
There is minimal blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles suggestive of small pleural effusions.
There are no signs of overt pulmonary edema.
A small-to-moderate right apical pneumothorax is relatively unchanged in size.
Small left-sided pleural effusion is unchanged.
Unchanged complete occlusion of the right ICA extending from the bifurcation to the petrous portion with the recalzed segment possibly representing antegrade collaterals, which are not directly visualized on CT. 2.
Evidence of large territory right MCA ischemia with a central smaller area of decreased blood volume suggestive of a core infarct.
No evidence of hemorrhage.
Unchanged left upper lobe apical opacity.
Unchanged right apical pneumothorax and moderately severe background emphysema.
MRI Head: [**2188-10-24**]: Acute infarcts in the distribution of right middle cerebral artery with cortical infarcts in the right posterior frontal region as well as in the watershed distribution and subcortical region.
No blood products seen.
Severe changes of small vessel disease.
Chronic right fontal lobe watershed infarct.
Absent flow void in the right internal carotid artery.
Echo: [**2188-10-24**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Mild pulmonary hypertension   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 17926**] was brought to the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2188-10-23**] for RUL VATS wedge resection of her FDG lung nodule suspicious for cancer.
Over night she developed left sided weakness and the stroke team was consulted.
Neuro: findings and recommendations: probable right fronto-parietal infarct due to embolism from an occluded right proximal ICA.
Head CT and MRI confirmed Acute infarcts in the distribution of right middle cerebral artery with cortical infarcts in the right posterior frontal region as well as in the watershed distribution and subcortical region.
Chest film: serial chest film were performed and showed a stable small to moderated right apical pneumothorax improving.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
