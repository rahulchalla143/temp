Admission Date:  [**2172-7-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2172-8-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2138-8-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3276**] Chief Complaint: Neutropenic fever, atrial fibrillation  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 33 year old female with a recently diagnosed thymoma.
At that time she was complaining of chest pain at the biopsy site.
n ECHO during that admission revealed an effusion but was negative for tamponade.
A CTA showed large mediastinal mass and cardiothoracic surgery did not feel there was any need for intervention as it was not felt to be hematoma.
During her admission she had episodes of hypoxia requiring supplemental O2 which was felt to be due to combination of Afib and pulmonary edema and atelectasis.
Following her discharge, she returned to the ED on [**2172-7-20**] for low BPs found by VNA services.
She was rehydrated with IVFs and her hypotension soon resolved.
Labs were significant for anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and a transaminitis, which has been stable and extensively worked up on a prior admission but exact etiology still unknown.
At that time CXR showed a large anterior mediastinal mass.
Flow Cytometry showed a non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile with diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by a B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma seen in specimen.
Past Medical History: # Thymoma ([**6-30**]) and status post chemotherapy [**7-13**] (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and cisplatin regimen) #Afib/flutter, diagnosed [**3-/2172**] # h/o transaminitis/LFT elevations - liver Bx from [**Hospital1 1474**] in [**1-/2172**] nonspecific minimal lobular and portal mononuclear cell inflammation w/ rare hepatocyte necrosis.
- negative for Hep A, B, and C # anemia, etiology [**Last Name (un) 5487**] # h/o high grade cervical SIL  Social History: Previously worked as a case manager for a home care company, out of work since recent diagnosis of Thymoma.
No tobacco or illicits.
Family History: Sister has atrial fibrillation and elevated liver enzymes, unknown cause.
Physical Exam: On admission/[**Hospital **] transfer to the ICU the patient's Physical Exam was as follows:   Physical Exam: T: 98.8 BP: 104/54 HR: 104 RR: 16 O2 100% RA Gen: ill appearing, pale, anxious affect HEENT: + conjunctival pallor.
OP clear, no thrush.
NECK: Supple, No LAD, No JVD.
No thyromegaly.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion subtending primarily the posterior and lateral walls of the left ventricle.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
No PE but limited study due to large anterior mediastinal mass.
Rounded hyperdense swirling density arising from site of prior biopsy, extending through the right anterior chest wall into the subpectoral soft tissues, most c/w hematoma; however, concerning for possible superinfection vs residual air related to bx.
Also possible contiguous tumor extension and invasion through the chest wall, though unlikely 3.
No significant interval change in appearance of biopsy-proven thymoma 4.
Increased small to moderate pericardial effusion, and small bilateral pleural effusions.
[**1-/2172**]: liver Bx from [**Hospital1 1474**] in [**2172-1-24**] showed nonspecific minimal lobular and portal mononuclear cell inflammation w/ rare hepatocyte necrosis.
CXR [**7-23**]: Wide mediastinum with known anterior mediastinal mass.
No other focal infiltrates or edema noted.

Brief Hospital Course: # SIRS : On admission, the patient met SIRS criteria of fever, leukopenia, and tachycardia plus suspected infection on initial presentation.
BLood, urine and throat cultures were negative and CXR remained without evidence of infiltrates.
The patient has a left sided subclavicular placed port which appeared clean and without bleeding, discharge on daily exams so it is an unlikely infection source.
UAs and cultures do not reveal any UTI sources to date nor are there any clinical symptoms to suspect GI source (no diarrhea, abdominal pains, occasional nausea likely chemo related).
She completed a course of IV vancomycin and cefepime, and remained afebrile for the remainder of her admission.
# Fevers: persistent fevers alongside neutropenia s/p recent chemotherapy ([**7-13**])prior to admission.
As of [**2172-7-27**], the patient is no longer neutropenic.
She remained afebrile for the duration of her admission.
# Afib:  with RVR in ED on [**7-23**].
Anemia may be contributing to afib/tachycardia also, thus was transfused 2 u pRBCs on [**2172-7-27**] - volume replete with NS IVFs - monitored UOP, keeping >35cc/hr - rate control attained through beta blocker, increased dose during ICU stay and continued home level Digoxin.
No evidence of tamponade on exam currently.
- CHADS score of 0 so ICU team felt there was no need for systemic anticoagulation.
#Anxiety - patient had crying and appeared extremely anxious during her stay so a psychiatric consult obtained and per recs she began Remeron as it was felt this would not only help her anxiety and mood but boost her poor appetite too.
#Chest pain: patient c/o intermittent [**2174-2-24**] chest pain throughout her ICU stay.
It was felt this pain was due to mediastinal mass or recent biopsy or combination of both.
There is possible contribution of pericardial inflammation from mass.
Pain was control with Oxycontin and Oxycodone prn and later Morphine PRN given as her nausea seemed to increase with oxycontin dosing.
# Anemia: Current Hct consistent with prior values during recent admission.
Retic was 1.8% in setting of anemia suggesting poor erythropoiesis.
Currently no suggestion of hemolysis with low normal K, Tbili of 0.7.
Suspect this change was due to myelosuppression from chemotherapy.
She had no evidence of bleeding during stay and by HD#4, on [**7-26**] her Plts had come back up to 170s range.
They remained stable and no further transfusions were needed.
# Transaminitis: LFTs c/w recent values.
GGT significantly elevated suggesting possible biliary process.
