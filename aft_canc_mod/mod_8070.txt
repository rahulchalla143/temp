He does endorse the sensation of urinary retension.
Denies SOB or chest pain.
In the ER he had a head CT that showed a posterior contusion.
No hematuria, no cough or SOB.

Multilevel degenerative  changes causing moderate canal narrowing at C3-4, C4-5 and C5-6.
CT head Unchanged hyperdense lesion along the left tentorium.
While this could represent hemorrhage from the prior reported trauma, a tentorial meningioma could also be considered.
Again as noted on the cervical spine CT of earlier today, there is an ill-defined sclerotic lesion in the posterior arch of C1, which could represent metastatic disease given the history of recently diagnosed prostate  MRI C-Spine The MR study confirms the findings on CT, namely multilevel cervical spondylosis extending from the C3-4 through C6-7 levels.
Small posterior osteophytes as well as infolding of the ligamentum flavum at each level produce a mild-to-moderate degree of spinal cord compression, most evident at the C3-4 interspace.
Associated uncovertebral spurring produces prominent bilateral C3-4 and C4-5 neural foraminal stenosis, and to a lesser degree on the left at C5-6 and C6-7 levels, again on the left.
As was noted on CT as well, there is a heterogeneous T1 and to a lesser extent T2 signal pattern within the bone marrow, which could represent degenerative changes.
However, as you informed us that the patient also has had chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a myeloproliferative disorder or reactive marrow changes secondary to prior therapy could enter into the differential diagnosis.
Metastatic prostate cancer is a possibility, but would seem in odds with the apparent contained nature of the disease which prompted localized therapy, with apparent low PSA levels present at the time of this scan (1.3).
There is no overt paraspinal pathology seen.
MRI head Small isointense T1 and hypointense T2 left tentorial lesion most consistent with a meningioma based on signal intensity values.
Renal US No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Incidentally noted exophytic cyst off the left kidney.
Findings are consistent with patient's known chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 81 YOM with CLL, prostate cancer s/p brachiotherapy, who was admitted with a head injury, hypernatremia, and renal failure .
# Head injury- Mr [**Known lastname 93945**] fell likely in setting of orthostasis from profound volume depletion/poor po intake.
CT neck showed some degenerative changes and question of small sclerotic lesion at C1, but no dislocation.
MRI of that area revealed some marrow hyperintensity and degenerative changes.
He had no neck pain.
If the patient has neurologic symptoms in the future a repeat MRI can be performed.
# Hypernatremia- Secondary to decreased PO intake; this resolved with IVF recussitation.
# Renal failure - Baseline is normal.
His lisinopril was held in the setting of renal failure.
# Poor appetite: Mr. [**Known lastname 93945**] refused to eat or drink most anything on admission.
Given his h/o esophageal stricture and a speech and swallow evaluation mentioning gagging the gastroenterology service was consulted.
The patient was taken down for a barium swallow but refused to complete the test.
With resolution of his uremia/renal failure as well as starting remeron his appetite began to improve.
# CLL - Mr [**Known lastname 93945**] [**Last Name (Titles) 93946**] was increased this hospitalization above baseline (from 35 to about 40).
He also had anemia and low platelets, whereas his counts had always been normal.
No LAD was seen on examIron studies did not reveal iron deficiency; Coombs test was negative; hemolysis labs were normal.
Hematology was consulted who felt that the anemia was likely [**3-1**] systemic illness/phlebotomy.
# Anemia - Not hemolytic.
# Deconditioning/ poor nutrition- Likely from some depression as well as uremia causing altered appetite.
# Prostate Ca - Recent treatment.
As above a CT scan mentioned sclerotic C1 lesion which was not apparent on MRI, however it did show some marrow hyperintensity.
# Access: PIVs .
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] of [**Location (un) 583**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Hypernatremia Dehydration Acute renal failure Fall Meningioma Prostate cancer with urinary obstruction   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with elevated sodium because of not eating and drinking adequately.
Because of your urinary obstruction we have placed a foley catheter that you should keep until [**7-16**], then you may need daily intermittent catheterization to make sure that you are emptying your bladder completely.
