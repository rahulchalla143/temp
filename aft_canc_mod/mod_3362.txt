Pt has a hx of renal cell ca s/p rt partial nephrectomy and on CT scan was found to have new rt sided renal mass.
He underwent CT guided bx on [**6-5**] c/b some bleeding requiring tract embolization.
He then returned to the ED on [**6-6**] for worsening hematuria and urinary obstruction due to clot.
He was seen by urology and foley was placed with bladder irrigation and cystoscopy revealed multiple clots.
He was found to have high grade gram neg bacteremia, metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate, and ARF.
Ultrasound of the kidneys on [**6-9**] showed mild rt hydronephrosis with good decompression of the bladder and the patient has had [**4-2**] foley catheter changes since his admission.
Cardiology was consulted as well for chest tightness and shortness of breath.
Echo showed new lateral wall motion abnormality and an EF of 30% so decision was made for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU for further evaluation of his cardiomyopathy and elevated CE.
Of note his renal bx results revealed clear cell carcinoma.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
Neck: Supple with no elevated JVP CV: PMI diffuse.
No thrills, lifts.
No S3 or S4 although difficult to auscultate Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU for managment of possible cardiomyopathy in the setting of sepsis.
Original concern was for new ischemic wall motion abnormality, but repeat echo here after resolution of septic physiology showed recovery of myocardial funtion with EF of 50%.
His lab values showed evidence of severe systemic septic response with likely ischemic injury from hypotension to body tissues.
LFT elevations, CK elevations (without MB) and a lactate of 7.7 all trended down on admission with maintence of blood pressure.
He was continued on [**Last Name (un) **]/Cipro IV x 2 days and when cultures from outside hospital showed Klebsiellia species pan-sensative (except for Augmentin) he was changed to IV cipro.
A repeat echo cardiogram showed resolution of the wall motion abnormalities.
Additionally, he had a large rise in his transaminases, reflecting shock liver.
A urine culture here grew 10,000 colonies of amp sensitive enterococcus, and so ampicillian was added to his regimen.
He did develop diarrhea, and had a persistently elevated wbc count.
2 C. Diff smears were negative, but he was started on flagyl x 7 days empirically for C. Diff.
