Patient was found to have a mediatinal mass which was biopsied and came back as B cell lymphoma.
Pt had PEG tube placed secondary to dysphagia and now takes almost all of his nutrition via PEG.
Despite the chemotherapy, the mediastinal mass has not improved and it was felt that perhaps the area could be rebiopsied to confirm diagnosis (as first biopsy done in [**State 108**]).
The patient has had intermittent episodes of dull chest pain in varied locations across his chest, radiating to his back when it is particularly severe, which became notably worse this past Friday.
No diaphoresis, radiation to jaw or arms, or nausea associated with the chest pain.
He also has frequent episodes of nausea, with vomiting on an almost daily basis.
Denies any cough or cold symptoms except for some very mild intermittent rhinorrhea, no fevers or cough; denies hematemesis, hemoptysis, BRBPR, melana, or hematuria.
He was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-23**] for planned IP stent given patient's increasing difficulty with breathing.
He had the stent placed on [**7-24**] and he reports his breathing feels much improved.

man with hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, infrarenal AAA, and posterior mediastinal mass with prior biopsy consistent with non-Hodgkin's B cell lymphoma who presented to [**Hospital 189**] Hospital for repeat biopsy, at which time he became acutely short of breath and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a bronchial stent.
1) Mediastinal Mass: The patient has a large posterior mediastinal mass obstructing esophagus and now compressing bronchi and pulmonary vasculature.
This was diagnosed as Non-Hodgkin's B cell lymphoma at outside hospital ([**State 108**]).
The patient is now s/p chemotherapy with no radiographic improvement.
Following admission, he underwent a left mainstem stent by the interventional pulmonary service on [**7-24**]; repeat bronchoscopy on [**7-27**] showed that the stent was patent and there was no need for a right mainstem stent.
The pathology was consistent with lymphoma (see attached report).
2) Relative hypotension: The patient's blood pressures remained in the low 100s, possibly due to  poor intake due to nausea or IVC compression from mediastinal mass.
Oxycodone-Acetaminophen 5-325 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: 5-10 MLs PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for chest/back pain.
Compazine 5 mg/5 mL Syrup Sig: [**4-12**] mL PO q 6 hours prn as needed for nausea.
If you experience any nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms please seek medical attention immediately.
