HISTORY:  [**Known lastname **] is a 30-6/7 week baby delivered at 1230 grams and admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for prematurity, respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis evaluation.
Maternal history was notable for chronic hypertension, and pregnancy was complicated by progressive preeclampsia.
Maternal history was otherwise notable for bipolar disorder, treated with Seroquel.
Due to worsening hypertension and proteinuria, mother was taken for c-section on [**2149-11-28**].
Infant was in moderate respiratory distress.
Respiratory: Infant was treated for RDS with intubation, one dose of surfactant, and mechanical ventilation for 2 days.
She had some mild apnea of prematurity, treated with caffeine for 17 days, with gradual resolution.
Last spell occured at approximately 36 weeks PMA, and by the time of discharge, she has been without spells for several weeks.
B. Cardiovascular: Infant remained hemodynamically stable throughout admission without need for cardiovascular support.
A murmur was noted over course of hospitalization, and cardiac evaluation on [**1-12**] revealed normal chest x-ray, normal EKG, and normal 4 extremity blood pressures.
Murmur persisted, and cardiology was consulted with ECHO performed on [**2150-2-3**]; ECHO was normal with no structural heart disease noted.
Progression of oral feedings was slow, most likely secondary to mechanical and pain issues related to her lip [**Known lastname 68813**] (see below), but eventually, infant transitioned to all oral feedings.
Weight gain overall has been consistent, and caloric density may be able to be decreased further in the near future.
She received no transfusions.
No lesions were noted on the buccal mucosa or posterior palate, and no lesions were seen in the perineum.
A culture was sent of the tongue on [**2-2**] which showed no evidence of yeast.
Thus, with no response to therapy, negative gram stain, and no evidence of yeast infection elsewhere, it was thought that the tongue findings were unlikely to be a yeast infection.
Of note, a small sacral dimple has been noted; this was not evaluated by ultrasound by the time of discharge.
G. Skin: Over the first few weeks of life, the infant was noted to develop multiple [**Known lastname 68813**], including a large hemangioma on the lower lip.
Subsequently, a portion of the lesion began to involute, but it subsequently ulcerated causing pain and discomfort.
No further growth in the lip lesion was seen, with some involution noted and progressive healing of the ulcerated portion.
No significant side-effects of the steroid therapy related to blood pressure or blood sugar was noted.
Plan at this time is to continue the current dose of orapred without adjustment for weight until 1 month of treatment (approximately [**2-21**]), and then to initiate weaning of the dose.
Born between 32 and 35 weeks with 2 of the following -     day care during RSV season, a smoker in the household,     neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities or school-age     siblings, or 3.
With chronic lung disease.
Before this age and for the 1st 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
Respiratory distress requiring Surfactant.
Sepsis evaluation.
Apnea of prematurity.
