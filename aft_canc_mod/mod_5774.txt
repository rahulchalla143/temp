Patient was hospitalized initially for symptomatic hypoglycemia caused by glipizide which was supposed to be discontinued.
On admission he was also noted to have a cough 3L O2 requirement, equivocal CXR and UTI and was started on treatment with levofloxacin.
During his hospitalization, he was noted to be ataxic, possibly froma  paraneoplastic porcess, and unsafe to go home unsupervised with plan to d/c today with 24 hour supervision and 2L home O2.
There was concern for mucus plug.
CXR showed question of new aspiration PNA.
Dyspnea has been going on for many years, worse in the last three years, but no acute change today.
He has had a cough for several week.
He also reports dysuria for several weeks.
Worsening ataxia that makes it difficult to ambulate, uses a 4pod cane at home.
He reports a 35lb weight loss over the last 3-5 weeks.
He has chronic double vision on the right side.
He subsequently had recurrent hospitalization for PNA and ultimately AMS.
MRI in [**11-4**] demonstarted new cortical T2/FLAIR-hyperintensity along left frontal lobe, and  the orbitofrontal gyrus in the anterior cranial fossa.
Developed progression of sx on CT, started on Gemcitabine [**10-6**], utlimately d/c'd [**1-6**] due to side effect(pneumonitis), restarted on palliative therapy with Navelbine recently reduced in dose intensity due to tolerance of side effects (fatigue and hematologic).

CXR [**2163-4-4**]: Stable appearance of chronic lung changes on top of known bronchioalveolar cell carcinoma.
CXR [**2163-4-5**]: Stable appearance of chronic lung changes from known bronchioalveolar carcinoma.
MRI HEAD [**2163-4-5**]: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, infarction, edema, mass, or mass effect.
Few scattered T2/FLAIR hyperintensities are seen in bilateral periventricular white matter and centrum semiovale, likely represent small vessel ischemic disease.
There is generalized prominence of ventricles, sulci, and extra-axial CSF spaces consistent with age-related involutional changes.
There is no abnormal enhancement seen.
Visualized orbits and mastoid air cells are unremarkable.
There is mucosal thickening in bilateral ethmoidal air cells.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of metastatic disease   Brief Hospital Course: 81 year old male with Stage IV bronchoalveolar carcinoma on palliative chemotherapy, ataxia, initially admitted to the floor with hypoglycemia, transferred to the MICU for hypoxia.
# Acute on chronic hypoxia: Likely a progression of his known BAC, with copius secretions and mucous plugging.
Initially thought that there could be a component of pneumonia and was treated with a course of vanc/cefepime/azithromycin, though our suspicioun for an infectious process was lower.
Given the irreversibility of his disease and worsening symptoms, a family meeting was held with his primary oncologist and the decison was made to discharge to rehab with bridge to hospice if no improvement.
# Delerium:  pt became delerious in the MICU secondary to several sleepless nights.
Of note, he was started briefly on ritalin to help with his daytime energy but this was discontinued in the setting of his delerium.
# Hypoglycemia: His poor PO intake and declining nutritional status in combination with his oral hypoglycemics and underlying UTI likely precipitated hypoglycemia.
Patient has history of UTI initally tender suprapubic region.
He was maintained on broad spectrum abx as above for his pna which covered his UTI .
Fever likely due to UTI and disease progression.
Deconditioning vs. paraneoplastic phenomenon.
PT feels that patient is a high fall risk and very unsteady on his feet.
Brain MRI shows no evidence of metastatic lesions.
# CAD s/p MI: No acute cardiovascular issues.
# Depression: Continued wellbutrin .
# Transitional issues: -Pt should continue nebs, Bronchopulmonary hygiene, guaifensin and supplemental O2 at rehab -Currently DNR/DNI.
