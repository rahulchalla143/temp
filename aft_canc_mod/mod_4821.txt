Admission Date:  [**2118-6-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-7-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-5-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: EMERGENCY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2565**] Chief Complaint: Failure to wean from mechanical ventilation  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2118-6-23**] Dynamic flexible bronchoscopy [**2118-6-27**] Rigid bronchoscopy; decannulation of [**Last Name (un) 295**] tracheostomy tube; flexible bronchoscopy; airway surveillance and therapeutic aspiration; #14 10 x 10 Dumon silicone Y- stent placement.
Rigid bronchoscopy.
[**2118-7-11**] PICC placement   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 62F with a medical history of SLE, mechanical ventilation s/p tracheostomy ([**2116**]) with worsening ventilator requirement transferred from outside hospital for interventional pulmonary evaluation.
She underwent tracheostomy in [**9-/2117**] with unclear etiology of her respiratory failure.
Per mother no history of respiratory disease but underwent colonoscopy and required intubation during this for respiratory distress.
While at nursing home became progressively difficult to wean from ventilator, becoming short of breath after several minutes.
Regarding her outside hospital course, she was found to have multi-drug resistant pseudomonas in her sputum and was treated with ceftazidime and amikacin.
Per notes there is history of para-esophageal rupture with fluid collection.
On bronchoscopy appeared to have collapsing distal tracheal walls and proximal mainstem bronchi.
CT showed chronic appearing infiltrates and possibly decreased airway diameter with extensive vertebral compression fractures also with breast mass (biopsy negative).
She is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for interventional pulmonary evaluation and possible airway stenting.
On the floor, she has no complaints.
Past Medical History: Multidrug resistant pseudomonal pneumonia Chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure Tracheobronchomalacia Mixed connective tissue disease Hypothyroidism Diabetes mellitus Depression Anxiety Thoracic spine compression fractures   Social History: Tobacco:non smoker Alcohol: none Lives in nursing home Occupation: Former biochemist   Family History: No lung cancer or congenital lung diseases   Physical Exam: DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM BP 99/69  HR 90s  O2 sat 100% on 50% trach collar GEN: Appears comfortable HEENT: PERRL, sclera anicteric, OP clear with MMM NECK: supple without JVP or LAD CV: regular rate nl S1S2 no m/r/g LUNG: unlabored respiration, good air movement, crackles at bases ABD: soft, NTND normoactive VS SKIN: diaphoretic, no rashes EXT: bilateral 1+ edema, cool, 1+ distal pulses NEURO: Awake, nonverbal, follows commands   Pertinent Results: EMG:  Mildly abnormal study.
There is no clear electrophysiologic evidence for a generalized polyneuropathy.
There is very subtle evidence for a mild, proximal myopathy without denervating features; this does not suggest an acute quadriplegic myopathy or critical illness neuromyopathy.
There is no evidence to suggest a disorder of motor neurons or their axons.
Repetitive stimulation of the facial nerve did not demonstrate any evidence for a disorder of neuromuscular transmission.
CT Chest [**2118-6-23**] IMPRESSION: Decreased lung volumes and diffuse ground glass opacity may relate only partially to hypoventilation, in the absence of little clinical history or previous imagig, the differential diagnosis for this appearance is broad.
It may represent a resolving acute lung injury, diffuse infectious process or COP.
Comparison with previous imaging would assist in determining the time course and possible etiology of this diffuse abnormality.
No pulmonary embolism.
Diffuse ground-glass opacities with subpleural reticular opacities and mild basilar predominance are most consistent with non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) pattern of interstitial lung disease, without fibrosis.
Severity and extent is similar to that seen eight days prior, with no new superimposed pulmonary process.
Tracheostomy tube and tracheal Y stent in place, without evidence of complication.
Status post distal esophageal resection with gastric pull-up repair, with fluid seen within the dilated esophagus into the upper thorax, increasing risk for aspiration.
Fat containing hiatal hernia surrounding gastric pull-up.
Kyphosis, but no retropulsion.
Mass or post-treatment changes are considerations.
Recommend correlation with mammography on a non-urgent basis.
New area of consolidation in the right upper lobe concerning for infection.
Stable appearance of diffuse ground-glass and reticular opacities which may be seen in nonspecific interstitial pneumonia.
EEG [**2118-7-8**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of background activity that was slower than average and disorganized.
This pattern may be seen in moderate encephalopathies of toxic, metabolic or anoxic etiology, or may be seen in the context of extensive lesions of bilateral subcortical or deeper midline structures.
No evidence of ongoing or potential epileptogenesis was seen at the time of this tracing.
No acute intracranial process.
Well calcified round lesion in the right frontal lobe.
[**2118-7-12**]:  CT abdomen/pelvis: No evidence for intra-abdominal abscess or colitis .
