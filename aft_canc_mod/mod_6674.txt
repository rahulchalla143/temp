Admission Date:  [**2151-6-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-7-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-3-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: nonresponsiveness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: HPI: Ms [**Known lastname 26442**] is a 81 year-old woman admitted to [**Hospital 88567**]Hospital with anemia, melanotic stool on [**2151-6-23**].
She was found to have a bleeding marginal ulcer and underwent UGIE and was transfused 4 units of blood.
EGD visualized a nonbleeding visible vessel which was appropriately clipped.
There was no spontaneous movement except that she would occasionally become flaccid.
Neurology was consulted and the patient was felt to have a brainstem stroke.
Minimal movement of her right upper extremity and bilateral lower extremities.
Prior to discharge, the patient was described as  "moaning, groaning with no purposeful movements".
Past Medical History: Hypertension CAD s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 892**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] II Marginal Ulcer s/p cauterization.
Pulmonary fibrosis Duodenal ulcer Rectal carcinoma, s/p radiation therapy HTN GERD Dyslipidema CHF Oxygen dependency  PSH: Gastrectomy Cholecystecomy   Social History: Patient lives at home with her husband and quit smoking over 50 years ago.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Extremities:warm and well perfused Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Head CT shows diffuse changes of small vessel disease, but no loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is noted, nor is there evidence of hemorrhage.
CT angiography of the neck demonstrates small vertebral artery secondary to persistent trigeminal artery, but no evidence of occlusion in the carotid or vertebral arteries.
Carotid calcifications seen.
Extensive parenchymal disease with bullous changes seen at the visualized both upper lungs.
Chest CT can help for further assessment.
These findings indicate chronic interstitial disease.
There is subcutaneous emphysema in the right upper thorax, which could be related to rupture of a bullous or secondary to a procedure.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates persistent right-sided trigeminal artery, but no vascular occlusion is seen.
EEG These findings are indicative of severe independent [**Hospital1 **]-hemispheric cerebral dysfunction likely an acute large focal structural lesion in the left hemisphere involving cortical and subcortical structures.
Large vessel territorial infarct and cortical spreading depression can give similar EEG patterns.
Alternatively, the left hemisphere focal slowing could be related to postictal dysfunction, but the degree of slowing would be unusual given that no seizures were seen from the left hemisphere during this recording.
There is also independent severe dysfunction over the right hemisphere with an epileptogenic focus in the right posterior quadrant giving rise to two right occipital subclinical seizures.
No definite seizures were seen after 8 p.m. on [**6-28**].
Suggest continuous EEG monitoring to monitor for recurrence of electrographic seizures.
CT-HEAD IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the brain without evidence of an acute major vascular territorial infarction.
Please note that MRI would be more sensitive for detecting an acute infarction and evaluating seizures, if clinically indicated.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the NeuroICU for rhythmic jerking and intermittent unresponsiveness.
She remained unresponsive to stimuli.
Repeat imaging showed a likely stroke in the left precentral area.
EEG was suggestive of a large area of ischemia.
Unfortunately her hospital course was complicated by worsening respiratory status.
A family meeting was held at which point the husband decided that his wife would not want heroic measures or to pursue aggressive measures given that she would likely have significant disability.
She was given sublingual Ativan for seizure prophylaxis.
