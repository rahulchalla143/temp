She was advised patient to go to local ER in [**Location (un) **] Valley, as [**Hospital1 18**] is 1 hour away, and had an ultrasound performed of her leg which was negative for DVT.
This morning, she came into clinic with [**10-14**] pain in her leg, and she was given Dilaudid 2mg IV and Solumedrol 100mg IV this AM and then admitted for pain control and preparation for BMBx tomorrow ([**1-14**]).

Past Medical History: Onc History: *[**9-/2193**]- Developed progressive lethargy -> elevated WBC count -> BMBx -> diagnosis of M5b AML.
*Admitted [**2194-1-24**] for allogeneic transplant from brother with cytoxan and TBI.
Hospital course complicated by diarrhea thought [**2-6**] GVHD of gut and intubation/transfer to unit for hypoxia of unknown etiology.
ICU course required pressors, complicated by renal failure on temp HD, shock liver, ?TTP with plasmapharesis, multiple small cortical infarcts in watershed pattern, seizures requiring phenobarb to control- all of unknown etiology; thought [**2-6**] SIRS with multi-organ failure.
*[**2194-6-26**]- Neuro f/u with no evidence of residual symptoms from stroke or epilepsy- tapered off AED.
*[**2194-8-19**]- developed back/abdomen rash c/w GVHD of skin, started on pred 20 *[**2194-9-9**]- developed oral ulcers c/w GVHD of oral mucosa, started on Famvir *[**2194-10-2**]- elevated LFT's c/w GVHD of liver *[**2194-11-11**]- increased Cellcept to 250 tid for persistent elevated LFTs .
Social History: She notes exposure to a number of chemicals including organic solvents and possibly benzene.
Physical Exam: T: Afebrile Pulse Ox: 98% RA P: 64 BP: 120/76 RR:18 Gen: Middle aged woman in NAD HEENT: posterior oropharynx and tonsils with non-exudative shallow ulcers bilaterally.
MMM, EOMI, PERRL CV: +s1+S2 RRR No M/R/G Resp: Bibasilar dry crackles Back: Hyperpigmented macular rash diffusely over back, no raised lesions Abd: Soft, NT ND Ext: No pretibial edema Neuro: CN 2-12 grossly intact, speech appropriate, strength 5/5 in BLE.
[**2195-1-15**]- CXR: IMPRESSION: New small right pleural effusion and adjacent subtle peripheral right lower lobe opacity.
The latter may be due to an early focus of pneumonia given the history of fever.
Allowing for slight differences in technique, there no change in the appearance of interstitial and alveolar opacities in bilateral lungs, consistent with ARDS.
[**2195-1-14**]- BMBx: Relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia with monocytic differentiation (FAB AML-M5a).
Micro: [**2195-1-29**] blood cx: ENTEROCOCCUS FAECIUM                              | AMPICILLIN------------  =>32 R DAPTOMYCIN------------       S LINEZOLID-------------     1 S PENICILLIN------------  =>64 R VANCOMYCIN------------  =>32 R   Brief Hospital Course: 49 yo female with AML s/p MRD allogeneic transplant 1 year prior to admission (complicated by chronic GVHD involving the skin, oral mucosa and liver- maintained on prednisone and cellcept), presented with leg pain and 6% blasts on peripheral smear.
A bone marrow biopsy was done showing relapse of AML and she was treated with MEC, after which she was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory distress.
She was intubated for worsening hypoxemia and increasing work of breathing.
Chest imaging was c/w infection as well as ARDS.
She grew out VRE in blood cultures.
She also remained pancytopenic so was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics and antifungals, including daptomycin, ampho, azithro, atovoquone, and meropenem.
She also was intermittently hypotensive and required frequent fluid boluses.
It was determined that she was in an incurable stage of her disease and the family decided to change the goals of care to focus on no escalation of care (no pressors, no IV fluids, no resuscitation).
Over the course of that evening, the patient became increasingly hypoxemic and had a drop in her blood pressure.
