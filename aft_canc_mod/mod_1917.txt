At that time her bilirubin climbed to over 70, and endoscopic treatment revealed a malignant biliary stricture which was stented; brushings of which were unfortunately consistent with adenocarcinoma.
After seeking the advice and consultation of Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] in his clinic on Monday, the tumor was deemed to be resect w/o evidence of metastatic disease.
At home, she was alerted to her blood gluc value, which had come back as 450 from her testing.
Since this finding is a poor prognostic indicator of underlying disease and may be considered malignant hyperglycemia, she was called at home and instructed to come straight to the ED for evaluation and admission to the West 2A surgical service.
