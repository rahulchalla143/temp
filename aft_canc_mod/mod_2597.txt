The patient states that four days ago he was bearing down secondary to constipation and had some dark black stools.
He had positive nausea when standing which was associated with some dizziness.
He denies any hematemesis, denies any abdominal pain.
Early the morning of admission, the patient experienced one episode of chest pressure for several minutes with some shortness of breath that then resolved on its own.
The pain itself is not associated with nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis.
He has had no similar episodes of chest pain in the past.
Of note, the patient had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy in [**2183-5-21**], for workup of melanotic stools that demonstrated prior peptic ulcer disease, diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and polyps in the rectum and hepatic flexure.
The patient has had a history of peptic ulcer disease and upper gastrointestinal bleed with hematemesis fifteen years ago.
In the Emergency Department, the patient was given nasogastric lavage which was negative for blood or bile and received two units of packed red blood cells and 40 meq of Potassium Chloride before transfer to the floor in stable condition.
Transitional cell carcinoma of the left kidney, most likely metastasis to the left periaortic and aortocaval nodes.
Asthma with p.r.n.
The patient has a history of diverticulosis and colonic polyps with adenoma at hepatic flexure, hyperplastic rectal polyp with biopsy negative.
History of peptic ulcer disease fifteen years ago.
Superficial bladder cancer, status post BCG treatments [**2182-10-21**].
FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother died at age of 96 and father died with an accidental death.
ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.
Generally, the patient is pleasant and in no acute distress.
The neck is supple, positive lymphadenopathy in the submandibular glands, 2+ carotid pulse bilaterally, no bruits.
Cardiac examination - regular rate and rhythm, II/IV crescendo decrescendo midpeaking murmur at the right upper sternal border radiating to the carotids and a II/IV holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla with laterally displaced point of maximal impulse.
Pulmonary examination - bilaterally expiratory wheezes with no crackles.
Extremities - feet warm to touch, palpable pedal pulses with no edema.
The pylorus suggested prior peptic ulcer disease.
The colonoscopy dated on [**2183-6-17**], showed diverticulosis of the sigmoid, polyps in the rectum and polyps in the hepatic flexure.
Left ventricular hypertroph.
Flattened T wave in lead I.
Chest x-ray on [**2183-7-13**], showed no infiltrates and no heart failure.
The most likely cause was a bleeding arteriovenous malformation that was between the second and third portion of the duodenum.
There was no further evidence of active bleeding.
CT of the abdomen was reported as negative for metastatic disease.
The patient had another episode of chest pain on [**2183-7-14**], with no associated symptoms.
The chest pain was described as substernal and did not radiate and lasted for a few minutes.
The patient then had a second episode of chest pain overnight on [**2183-7-15**], and again with no changes.
The patient was considered to have ruled in for myocardial infarction.
An echocardiogram was done which showed the left atrium mildly dilated with left ventricular cavity normal.
Overall left ventricular function was mildly depressed with posterior hypokinesis.
The aortic valve was mildly thickened, mitral valve was moderately thickened, severe 4+ mitral regurgitation, mild pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension.
The patient's cardiac ischemia was thought to be most likely due to demand ischemia secondary to a profoundly low hematocrit of 13.0 upon presentation.
The patient had thrombocytopenia with platelets on presentation of 51,000.
This was thought to be secondary to his chemotherapy and also to his bleeding and climbed nicely during his hospital stay.
The patient had no further gastrointestinal events and no further cardiac events and was ready for discharge, however, the patient then spiked a temperature and was found to be neutropenic with white blood cell count of 1.1 and absolute neutrophil count of 350.
The patient also had some crackles on the left lower base during lung examination and was given a chest x-ray which showed left lower lobe consolidation possibly consistent with atelectasis or infiltrate.
and neutropenic precautions.
as needed for constipation.
The patient was diagnosed with subconjunctival hemorrhage likely secondary to thrombocytopenia and severe anemia.
Recommended for lubrication and monitoring.
The patient was discharged with a prescription for Lacri-Lube Artificial Tears one drop in the left eye as needed for redness.
