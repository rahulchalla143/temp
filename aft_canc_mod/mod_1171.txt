Admission Date:  [**2104-1-17**]     Discharge Date:  [**2104-1-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2044-6-27**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59 year old man with a history of stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung, who originally presented with a neck mass in [**2102-8-8**] and was found to have stage IV lung cancer with metastases to his left neck and subcarinal lymph nodes, status post a right upper lobe wedge resection in [**2102-10-8**].
A follow-up CT scan in [**2103-6-8**] and [**2103-9-8**] showed interval worsening of the pulmonary nodules as well as retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
The patient presented to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital the Saturday prior to admission with atypical right sided chest pain.
There, a CT angiogram showed small filling defects of tertiary branches of his pulmonary vasculature and a pericardial effusion.
He was started on heparin, with a drop in his platelet count from 244,000 to 130,000 in three days.
A repeat CT angiogram showed tiny nonocclusive filling defects in the lower lobes bilaterally, consistent with emboli, and a large pericardial effusion with a pulsus of 30.
An emergent echocardiogram was performed that was consistent with tamponade.
The patient was taken to the catheterization laboratory for pericardiocentesis under fluoroscopy.
Stage IV adenocarcinoma with clear cell features of lung, as described above.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
He has no history of drug abuse.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient was a pleasant male in no acute distress who was afebrile with a heart rate of 115, respiratory rate 20s, blood pressure 90s/60s with an oxygen saturation of 98% on two liters.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardiac with no murmurs but a rub in systolic and diastole loudest at the apex.
Extremities:  Without edema, groin sites looked good.
Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with biphasic P waves but normal voltage criteria after catheterization.
The drain was successfully removed after a repeat echocardiogram showed minimal reaccumulation and he had drained less than 25 cc over 24 hours.
The drainage fluid was positive for malignant cells and so was likely secondary to lung metastases.
As anticoagulation for his pulmonary embolism was contraindicated secondary to his bleeding pericardial metastases, an inferior vena cava filter was placed to lower the risk of future pulmonary embolism.
The patient's oncologists, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 26763**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], had a discussion with him regarding his life expectancy, which is about one month secondary to his underlying disease.
Tamponade secondary to pericardial metastases.
Pulmonary embolism, status post inferior vena cava filter     placement.
Stage IV metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung.
