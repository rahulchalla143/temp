Patient had echo done this AM, [**2189-9-11**], as ordered by his PCP for peripheral edema (as an outpatient), which showed tamponade.
Specifically, she had a small-moderate pericardial effusion with RV diastolic collapse.
Pericardiocentesis with micropuncture needle under echo guidance was done with pt in upright position.
Post-pericardiocentesis echocardiogram showed no fluid and no signs of tamponade, and the patient was admitted to the CCU.
She denies pain at the site of the drain.
Per her son, she had been complaining of pleuritic pain over the past few weeks, for which her oncologist prescribed cough suppressives.
On review of systems, she (and her family) denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
No history of smoking, alcohol, or illicit drug use.
Family History: FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for Colon cancer in her father.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
No HSM or tenderness.
No femoral bruits.
Notable cogwheeling and rigidity on muscular exam with some choreiform movements.

Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.

No femoral bruits.
Notable cogwheeling and rigidity on muscular exam with some choreiform movements.
[**2189-9-11**] cardiac cath: INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION: Pericardial tamponade  PROCEDURE: Pericardiocentesis via subcostal approach with echocardiographic guidance.
Elevation and equalization of filling pressures.
Pulsus paradox of 45 mm hg all consistent with tamponade physiology.
Interventional details Accessed pericardial space with combination of echocardiography, pressure and fluoroscopic guidance using a micropuncture needle.
Needle temporarily in the RV which was expected given small nature of the pericardial effusion.
Exchanged for an Amplatz stiff wire and using a series of 5,6,7,8 French Dilators were able to place an 8 French drainage catheter and remove 120 cc of bloody fluid.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There is marked right ventricular diastolic collapse (primarily involving the infundibular segment, but also to a lesser degree the anterior free wall), consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
[**2189-9-11**] post cath echo:  prepericardiocentesis: small circumferential pericardial effusion with right ventricular free wall diastolic collapse  postpericardiocentesis: no residual pericardial effusion; no chamber collapse; improved ventricular filling .
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2189-9-14**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):     ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2189-9-12**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.

# Tamponade:  Patient was admitted from the ECHO lab after routine imaging showed evidence of pericardial effusion of tamponade physiology.
Patient was sent directly to the cath lab where a right heart catheterization confirmed the diagnosis of tamponade with a Pulsus of 45 mg Hg.
A transcutaneous drainage procedure was preformed with 150 cc of serosanginous fluid removal and decrease in the pulsus to 15 mg Hg.
Patient was later sent for difinitive pericardial window by CT surgery and tolerated the procedure well.
Per the surgical report patient had -closely monitor pericardial fluid drainage.
# Metastatic NSCLC:  patient was admitted with a known diagnosis of stage IV NSCLC with metastatis to the brain, a large left sided effusion vs collapse on CXR and was s/p cyberknife therapy.
Patient was seen while in the CCU by her oncologists who began erlotinib for a EGFR mutation sensitive tumor.
Patient developed heavy output loose stools to this medication, but no other side effects.
Patient was continued on a dexamethasone taper for her reccent cyberknife procedure.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient had known NSCLC and was noted to be hypoxic to the low 90s on addmission though not on home oxygen.
CXR showed complete white out of the left lung suggesting effusion vs. collapse and appeared worse from a prior CXR in [**Month (only) **].
Patient had plurex catheter in on admisison and IP was consulted who d/c'd the tube as it had not had any output in several days.
#  Parkinson's Disease:  Patient with a known history of severe parkinson's disease and noted to have writhing choreform movements on admission.
# Hep B: patient continued on home entecavir.
