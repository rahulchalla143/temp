HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old female who has a history of metastatic breast cancer who was started on Decadron on [**2107-9-27**] after starting stereotactic radiation therapy to the midbrain for a 7-mm metastasis as well as gemcitabine treatment.
She reported to the Hematology/[**Hospital **] Clinic on [**11-9**] in order to receive her gemcitabine; however, she felt weak and had a fever at that time to 101.7.
The patient continued to feel weak and had chills and shakes overnight, and therefore she called her oncologist who instructed her to report to the Emergency Department for a fever workup.
The patient has had a recent sinus infection which was treated with Augmentin; the course ended on [**11-9**].
The patient denied any nausea, vomiting, urinary symptoms, diarrhea, cough, and shortness of breath.
She has had some nasal congestion which has been improving over the past two weeks after being stated on Augmentin.
The patient's Port-A-Cath in the left chest was without any erythema.
There was no evidence of skin breakdown.
The patient has noted increasing proximal muscle weakness over the past few weeks after being started on the Decadron.
In [**2106-9-26**] she was found to have a new left breast cancer (her original primary was in the right breast).
She had eight positive lymph nodes that were estrogen-receptor positive.
She had a head CT which showed multiple brain metastases.
She had a follow-up MRI done on [**2107-9-27**] which showed residual brain metastases.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's mother died of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and Alzheimer's disease.
Her father died of pancreatic cancer.
In general, the patient was a thin woman with mild cushingoid features, somewhat restless.
The neck had no lymphadenopathy.
There was no jugular venous distention.
The heart had a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border.
There was mild diffuse discomfort with pressure.
The extremities were without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Motor examination was notable for some weakness in the triceps and hamstrings at a level of [**3-31**].
The patient complained of mild double vision which was unchanged from her previous status.
Urinalysis was positive only for minimal protein.
On microscopic examination there were no red blood cells, there were 0 to 2 white blood cells, occasional bacteria with 3 to 5 epithelial cells.
There were no consolidations or pneumothorax.
There was resolution of bilateral pleural effusions compared with previous examination.
There was diffuse osteopenia.
At the time of admission the patient was felt most likely to have a possible sinus or abdominal source of infection.
She had no real localizing symptoms of infection on admission.
On the day following admission, the patient was noted to have bronchial irritability with persistent coughing with deep inspirations.
She also then stated she had a dry cough at home for a couple of days prior to admission.
A chest CT was obtained to look for possible infiltrates which could not be appreciated on chest x-ray, being most concerned with possible Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia given the patient's previous steroid treatment and recent tapering of her steroids.
The chest CT showed diffuse ground-glass opacities which were consistent with possible opportunistic infection.
Her LDH was measured which also was elevated in the 700s.
Therefore, based on the clinical findings the patient was felt to likely have Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
A repeat chest x-ray at that time showed bilateral alveolar infiltrates which were new compared with the three days prior.
The patient was transferred to the unit at that time as it was felt that she had rapidly progressive Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and was at risk for possible intubation.
She also had been started on prednisone for her Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia the day she had been transferred to the Intensive Care Unit at a dose of 40 mg p.o.
A repeat chest x-ray was obtained three days after being transferred out to the floor, and she was found to have a 30% pneumothorax in the left lung likely secondary to underlying Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia as well as positive pressure ventilation in the unit.
The chest tube continued to have an intermittent air leak, however.
By [**11-23**] the chest tube was without air leak.
At the time of this dictation, on [**11-24**], the patient was still with a small apical residual pneumothorax on the left.
She again had an air leak in her chest tube.
The patient's only other active medical problem while she has been an inpatient has included a low sodium level.
It was felt to be most likely secondary to syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, although adrenal insufficiency secondary to long-term glucocorticoid use was also a possibility.
