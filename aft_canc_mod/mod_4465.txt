She was in her usual state of health until three days prior to this presentation when she noticed worsenign shortness of breath and non-productive cough.
She initially attributed this to her cancer but the shortness of breath progressively worsened to dyspnea at rest.
It was not associated with leg pain or swelling.
It was associated with non-productive cough, lethargy and decreased PO intake.
She had a CTA which showed a large right sided PE, large right sided pleural effusion and right sided collapse.
She had an EKG which showed normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals, TWF III, avF, otherwise no acute ST segment changes.
She had a CXR which showed complete opacification of the right lung.
On arrival to the ICU she reports that her dyspnea has improved since arrival to the hospital.
She endorses worsening non-productive cough and dyspnea on exertion as above.

EKG: normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals, TWF III, avF, otherwise no acute ST segment changes.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus and ascending levels are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CXR [**2171-12-25**]: Again seen is complete whiteout of the right hemithorax and worsening opacification of a previously seen small area of spared lung parenchyma in the right upper chest.
Incidentally noted is contrast in the pelvis of the kidneys consistent with recent IV contrast injection.

Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 61 year old female with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension and recently diagnosed stage IIIb non-small cell lung cancer who presents with three days of progressive dyspnea found to have large right sided pulmonary embolism, pleural effusion and right sided collapse.
Dyspnea:  Likely multifactorial secondary to large left sided pulmonary embolism, large right sided pleural effusion, right lung collapse.
No signs and symptoms of infection presently.
No indications for lysis given that she was hemodynamically stable and BNP and troponins were within normal limits.
LENIs were without evidence of DVT.
Fluid sent for cytology, which showed malignant cells consistent with non-small cell lung cancer.
The patient then had a pleurx catheter placed in her right thorax for symptomatic relief, with good effect.
Lovenox was restarted for long-term management of her thromboembolic disease, which was continued at discharge.
Now presents with dyspnea, large effusion and pulmonary embolism.
She was discharged with short term anti-emetics.
Patient has anxiety regarding diagnosis and treatment plan, information was given to Hope Lodge for future needs.
Anemia: HCT improved during admission; there was concern for bleed into pleural space.
No signs or symptoms of bleeding were evident, stool guaiac was negative.
labs showed iron deficient, no hemolysis.
