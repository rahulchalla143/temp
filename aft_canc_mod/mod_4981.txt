He underwent an incomplete resection of a right brain lesion in [**State 5864**] and had a temporary resevoir for the cystic component.
Social EtOH, no other drugs.
[**Last Name (LF) 2994**], [**First Name3 (LF) 2995**] [**5-21**], no pronator drift.
Head incision is C/D/I, dissolveable sutures.
Recommend MRI to assess for residual tumor bulk.
Acute infarct versus post-surgical cytotoxic edema in superior right frontal lobe.
Unchanged inferior cerebellar tonsillar displacement.
Extensive new pulmonary emboli in the right lower lobe artery and posterior/lateral segmental arteries of the right lower lobe.
Associated pleural effusion, atelectasis, and likely pulmonary infarction in the right lung base.
Apparent resolution of left lower lobe pulmonary embolus.
Mild right hilar lymphadenopathy.
Small right pleural effusion with adjacent right lower lobe atelectasis and likely pulmonary infarction, as seen on earlier same day CTA chest.
Large IVC clot burden seen extending from the confluence of the iliac veins, through the infrarenal IVC filter, and extending superiorly beyond the tip of the IVC filter for 3.2 cm, just beyond the level of the inferior renal vein.
Stranding along the right iliac vessels and the lower IVC likely due to thrombosis.
Increased vasogenic edema noted.
CT Head [**2104-2-23**]: IMPRESSION: Stable post-surgical changes from the partial resection of the large right frontal mass.
No fractures or alignment abnormalities.
Retroperitoneal stranding, could be related to chronic venous thrombosis with a potential non-occlusive thrombus in the left common iliac vein, subptimally evaluated in non-contrast setting.
He was taken to the OR by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a stereotactic approach to further decompression of right sided lesion previously classified at oligodendroglioma.
He had a fever to 101.2 on [**2104-2-20**].
LENS studies showed Non-occlusive thrombus in the right iliac vein.
He developed midsternal chest pain overnight into [**2104-2-21**].
There was a question of an iodine allergy when the CTA was ordered.
He developed a truncal rash later in the week and took Benadryl.
He never had an anaphylactic reaction.
The time course for the development of the rash seems more consistent with a Dilantin rash than an iodine allergy.
He continued to have midline LBP thought to be a result of immobility.
CT head in the morning showed increase in vasogenic edema but stable.
On [**2104-2-23**] Lumbar spine CT was done and was negative for any fractures or malalignment.
CTA Abdomen/Pelvis to evaluate the cage/filter showed no new thrombus.
He has a recurrence of CP during the afternoon of [**2-26**].
IT was similar in quality to pain that he had previously.
This showed no acute pulmonary issues.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain or fever.
Methocarbamol 500 mg Tablet Sig: 1.5 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for back pain.

You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.
-An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.
Loss of vision, either partial or total.
Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.
Severe sensitivity to light.
Severe headache or change in headache.
Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
New onset of seizure or change in seizure, or seizure from which you wake up confused.
Due to the complexity of neurosurgical procedures and treatment of neurosurgical problems, effective advice regarding emergency situations cannot be given over the telephone.
Should you have a situation which is not life-threatening, but you feel needs addressing before normal office hours or on the weekend, please present to the local emergency room, where the physician there will evaluate you and contact us if needed.
