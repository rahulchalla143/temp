There is no evidence of stones, mass, or hydronephrosis.
Doppler waveform analysis of the renal arteries was performed to evaluate for renal artery stenosis.
The left renal arteries are difficult to evaluate despite scanning with multiple accoustic windows and in multiple patient positions.
No evidence of stones, mass, or hydronephrosis.
No evidence of renal artery stenosis on the right.
Despite slight limitation on the left, no evidence of renal artery stenosis.
Patient was monitored by a nurse throughout the procedure Echocardiographic Measurements Results  Measurements  Normal Range Aorta - Ascending:  3.4 cm  <= 3.4 cm Aorta - Descending Thoracic:  *3.3 cm  <= 2.5 cm Findings LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Mildly dilated descending aorta.
Simple atheroma in abdominal aorta.
No thoracic aortic dissection.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
No masses or vegetations on aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
No masses or vegetations on mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Image quality was suboptimald - poor esophageal contact.
Conclusions Technically suboptimal study due to poor contact.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is prominent symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There are simple atheroma in the abdominal aorta.
The descending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
An eccentric jet of moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen directed towards the anterior mitral leaflet.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate aortic regurgitation with thickened leaflets but without discrete vegetation.
Dilated descending aorta without evidence of aortic dissection.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
