The patient was born prematurely due to worsening maternal pregnancy-induced hypertension.
The prenatal history includes mother was a 46- year-old female with prenatal labs significant for blood type A+, antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, rubella immune, and GBS unknown.
The pregnancy was complicated by pregnancy-induced hypertension and mom was treated with nifedipine.
The patient had no palatal cleft.
The patient had no dysmorphic faces.
Cardiovascularly this patient had normal S1 and S2, with a 2/6 systolic murmur noted most loudly at the left sternal border.
The patient's abdomen was soft, nondistended, and nontender, and no palpable masses were felt.
The GU exam was significant for bilateral descended testicles and a circumcised penis.
The patient had a small left inguinal scar that was well appearing.
The patient also had apnea of prematurity.
The patient was observed without any     apnea or bradycardia events for greater than 5 days prior     to discharge.
This patient continued to have a systolic murmur     during exams for the remainder of the hospital course.
The cardiac MRI     was also performed to evaluate for evidence of congestive     heart failure related to potential high output failure     from the liver hemangiomas.
It is possible     that the liver hemangiomas will continue to enlarge, and     the patient may begin to have evidence of congestive     heart failure in the future.
GI: On [**2-18**]-14, this patient was noted to have     increasing abdominal distention.
A KUB was performed     that showed no free air.
KUB also did not show evidence     of necrotizing enterocolitis.
The belly and GU exam also     revealed scrotal swelling.
It was found that the patient did     have a left-sided incarcerated hernia.
Initially minimal amounts of ischemic bowel     were seen during the procedure, but when the bowel was     removed from the hernia, it became pink and well     perfused.
Hematology: This patient did have hyperbilirubinemia and     was on phototherapy the first week of life.
This patient has anemia of prematurity and was placed on     iron during the hospitalization.
Infectious disease: This patient was initially started     on ampicillin and gentamicin for a rule out sepsis     evaluation at birth due to respiratory distress and     premature birth.
The most recent head ultrasound     performed on [**2145-3-12**], prior to discharge, revealed     a small left-sided germinal matrix hemorrhage.
Renal: In the last 1-2 weeks prior to discharge, this     patient was noted to have intermittent elevated systolic     blood pressures.
There is an enlarged celiac axis and hepatic     artery into the liver.
This     patient was evaluated by the cardiovascular clinic     including Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7860**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], NNP, who are     members of the vascular anomaly team.
Of note, the     problems with hypertension preceded the administration of     prednisone.
The first had abnormal values for     metabolic levels often seen in preterm infant receiving     hyperalimentation.
IMMUNIZATION RECOMMENDED:  Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who meet any of the following 4 criteria: 1) born at less than 32 weeks, 2) born between 32 and 35-0/7 weeks with 2 of the following: Day care during RSV season, a smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities, or school-age siblings, 3) with chronic lung disease, or 4) hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease.
Before this age (and for the first 24 months of the child's life), immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
This patient will also have a referral for early     intervention for premature birth.
Respiratory distress syndrome.
Apnea of prematurity.
Anemia of prematurity.
Small left-sided germinal matric hemorrhage.
