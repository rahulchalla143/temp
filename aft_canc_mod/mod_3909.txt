Admission Date:  [**2200-9-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2200-9-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2131-4-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MED  Allergies: Iodine / Penicillins / Iodine; Iodine Containing  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**] Chief Complaint: 69M w/ hx pancreatic CA dx [**12-12**] s/p multiple CBD stent placements was admitted on [**2200-9-17**] with acute cholangitis.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP 7 cm 10 French stent placement  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known firstname 53773**] is a 69 year old Italian speaking gentleman diagnosed with pancreatic CA in [**12-12**], s/p multiple CBD stent placements, who presented to an OSH on [**2200-9-15**] with severe abdominal pain and jaundice.
He had been feeling well since removal of his last stent in [**7-13**] until [**2200-9-10**], when he told his family that he wasn't feeling well, with decreased appetite and malaise that progressed during the next several days.
On [**2200-9-15**] he experienced onset of severe abdominal pain in the RUQ and epigastric region with radiation to his back, and was admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital.
He denied fevers or chills.
He was afebrile, hemodynamically stable, with no leukocytosis, so was given IV hydration and analgesia.
He complained of severe abdominal pain radiating to his back.
ERCP was performed on [**9-18**], and the patient was noted to have a 10 mm long irregular stricture of the lower [**1-11**] CBD.
The patient noted resolution of pain following ERCP.
He was transferred to the floor on the morning of [**2200-9-20**] for monitoring and evaluation.
The history of Mr. [**Known lastname 53774**] pancreatic cancer is as follows.
He had been in his usual state of good health until [**Month (only) 359**] of [**2199**], when he began experiencing abdominal pain and anorexia.
He was treated with antibiotics with initial resolution of symptoms, but through [**Month (only) **] and [**Month (only) 1096**] noted increasing anorexia.
Non-contrast CT at that time showed an abnormal pancreatic duct with ductal dilation, a cystic lesion measuring 8 mm in the pancreatic body and a cystic structure in the tail measuring 1.3 cm.
ERCP showed stricture of both the pancreatic duct and intra-pancreatic portion of the CBD, and a plastic stent was placed in the CBD.
Cytology was negative for malignant cells.
The patient continued to experience nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, without fever or jaundice.
EUS with FNA of the pancreatic cystic lesions (head and body) on [**2200-2-6**] revealed atypical cells and CEA of 416.
Based on cytology, the patient was thought to have either IPMT or mucinous ductal ectasia, and a Whipple procedure was contemplated for [**2200-6-4**].
An echo showed EF of 65% and an exercise stress test showed no evidence of ischemia.
However, just before the procedure, the patient was hospitalized for SOB and was found to be in pulmonary edema.
Per his niece, plans for surgery in the immediate future were discontinued secondary to concerns for his perioperative pulmonary status.
On repeat ERCP, the CBD stent was removed on [**2200-7-10**] and not replaced when it was found that a 12 mm balloon could be passed through the stricture.
He did well at home on solid POs and 3L O2, with good mobility and mental function, until the symptoms prompting the current admission.
Pancreatic CA, as above 2.
Ventricular ectopy, possibly secondary to small MI at age 40 4.
Anxiety  PSH: - s/p laminectomy in 30s, for back pain following a car accident.
Negative for pancreatic, colorectal, or any other CAD.
No Virchow's node appreciated.
PULM: Reduced breath sounds bilaterally.
CV: NSR, no MRG.
ABD: soft, non-distended, tender to palpation in RUQ, no rebound or guarding.
No masses appreciated.
No periumbilical nodes appreciated.
Varicosity noted on anterior aspect of R crus.
An area of lucency representing a bulla is seen in the right lower lobe, and a smaller than was seen on the previous exam.
Diffuse linear opacities are noted, likely representing parenchymal scarring and fibrosis are seen diffusely bilaterally.
No pneumothorax is seen.
No osseous abnormalities are identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia.
Right lower lobe bulla is smaller in comparison to previous exam.
Diffuse interstitial scar is seen.
ERCP [**2200-9-18**]:  - A single irregular stricture that was 10 mm long was seen at the lower third of the common bile duct and it could represent malignant versus inflammatory stricture.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 69M with hx pancreatic cancer since [**12-12**], s/p multiple CBD stents, presents to OSH with abdominal pain and jaundice.
Transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**], ERCP performed, and stent placed [**2200-9-18**], with resolution of pain and disorientation.
GI History and labs consistent with ascending cholangitis [**2-10**] CBD stricture.
S/p ERCP with stent placement on [**2200-9-18**], with resolution of pain and disorientation.
Pain free since [**2200-9-19**].
Will f/u with ERCP in [**1-10**] months for metallic stent.
Pancreatic CA  Whipple procedure considered in [**5-13**] but aborted due to episode of pulmonary edema and concern for pulmonary status.
Pulmonary  Etiology of oxygen requirement uncertain.
Per niece, patient had not needed oxygen prior to [**Month (only) 116**] episode of pulmonary edema; has been on 3L home O2 requirement since to maintain sats in low 90s.
Pulmonary edema episode may have been caused by volume overload [**2-10**] TPN, transient cardiac ischemia, or less likely PE.
- LENIs negative, no right heart strain per TTE.
- WBC stable.
Has not spiked fever since [**2200-9-18**].
- C. diff antigen from [**9-20**] negative.
No evidence of volume overload by lung, neck, or extremities exam.
Digitoxin started during pulmonary edema episode d/ced in MICU due to suggestion of first degree heart block.
- Ischemia: no evidence of current ischemia.
- Rhythm: borderline first degree heart block noted on EKG, Dig discontinued.
No active issues.
Endocrine: - Improved sugars with increased SS Insulin.
Alternatively, could be new onset diabetes [**2-10**] pancreatic process.
PO Morphine IR for breakthrough pain.
Anxiety and Depression -	However, patient is still sad and periodically anxious.
