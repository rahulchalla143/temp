Again seen is stable prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and moderate to moderately large right and small to moderate left pleural effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
There is also some irregular nodular and linear density in the left mid zone.
Possibility of pneumonia at the lung base cannot be excluded.
Blood cultures: Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2181-8-31**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.

Brief Hospital Course: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of CAD, LUL bronchoalveolar carcinoma, recurrent R sided pleural effusion, and HTN who presented with increased DOE over past several days found to have UTI on UA and found to be bacteremic.
# GNR bacteremia: likely the source is urine.
Pt was initially started on ciprofloxacin for UTI and when blood cultures grew out GNR zosyn was added.
She remained afebrile through the course of admission.
#CHF/PLEURAL EFFUSIONS: Patient was diuresed upon admission as she appeared mildly volume overloaded.
Pt has chronic pleural effusions that may have added to her baseline shortness of breath.
In the MICU, the patient was initially treated for her flash pulmonary edema with a night of BiPAP.
She was initially diuresed, but developed a contraction alkalosis.
Lasix was held for a couple of days, but patient was never in a positive fluid balance.
Interventional pulmonology re-evaluated her pleural effusions after she was initially stabilized.
Bedside ultrasound showed a fluid collection that was too small to tap.
A repeat CXR showed persistent pleural effusions with apparent loculation on the right.
Unfortunately, patient had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema with hypertension.
It was felt the patient was too unstable for this procedure, and it will be held for a later time.
Her multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema were relieved with lasix, nitroglycerin paste, metoprolol, and nebulizers.
The patient subsequently developed two brief hypotensive episodes with readings of 70/40, after resolution of her flash episodes.
She was given a gentle 250 cc bolus of NS, which normalized her blood pressure.
Cardiology was consulted to help with maximizing blood pressure control in the setting of severe diastolic heart failure.
Palliative care was consulted to help the patient and family understand the obstacles of care; we can maximize her BP regimen, but cannot completely prevent episodes of flash pulmonary edema.
# RECENT PE: pt was admitted with supra therapeutic INR and Coumadin was held.
Since the patient has a high likelihood of lung cancer, it was felt enoxaparin was a better medication for anti-coagulation.
Iron studies showed patient with iron deficiency anemia.
Iron was ultimately discontinued as this will not likely effect patient's short term prognosis.
# Hypothyroidism: Stable.
# GERD: Continued omeprazole.
# Code: DNR/DNI .
# Communication: Patient.

Flash Pumlmonary Edema 2.
E. coli Bacteremia Secondary: 1.
Chronic stable pleural effusions 2.
History of Pulmonary Embolus on anticoagulation 3.
Hyperlipidemia 4.
Hypertension 5.
Probable lung cancer  Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because of shortness of breath and increasing fatigue.
You were found to have a urine infection and bacteria in your blood.
You also had shortness of breath during your hospitalization.
We felt your chronic shortness of breath was due to your pleural effusions.
We did not drain these effusions because your breathing remained stable.
You also developed several episodes of acute shortness of breath called flash pulmonary edema.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you are feeling short of breath or very tired or have fevers or for any other symptoms which are concerning to you.
