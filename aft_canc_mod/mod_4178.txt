Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: B/L CIA stents, Right EIA stent Mediastinoscopy Lung Cancer   History of Present Illness: 49 y/o homeless male with history of severe PVD, DM, alcoholism, and COPD who was transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**10-3**] for management of RLE ulcer and cellulitis.He has undergone  iliac stent placement (b/l CIA, R EIA) with an extended PACU course  However his pre-operative work-up reveled two opacities in the LUL.
The patient has undergone a full staging work-up with cervical mediastinoscopy, that revealed to evidence of malignancy in the nodes, a PET scan that revealed FDG avid disease only in the LUL and a head MRI that was within normal limits.
However, given his poor pulmonary function, thoracic surgery does not feel that he is a good candidate for resection.
He denies nightmares, flashback or hypervigilance.

Cardiology Report STRESS Study Date of [**2186-10-25**]  EXERCISE RESULTS  TOTAL EXERCISE TIME:  4 % MAX HRT RATE ACHIEVED:  54  SYMPTOMS: NONE ST DEPRESSION: NONE  INTERPRETATION: This 49 yo diabetic male was referred to the lab for evaluation prior to surgery.
The patient denied any arm, neck, back or chest discomfort throughout the study.
There were no significant ST segment changes noted.
IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or ischemic EKG changes noted.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.  GENERAL COMMENTS: Left pleural effusion.
Due to suboptimal technical  quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
INTERPRETATION:  There is focal abnormal uptake of FDG in a left upper lobe spiculated nodule (SUVmax 3.1) and mild FDG-uptake in a more lateral spiculatednodule (SUVmax 1.7).
There is mild uptake in paraesophageal region at the azygoesophageal recess,where there is a tubular hyperdense structure; it is probably vascular.
There are bilateral pleural effusions and on the right at the level of the rightmain pulmonary artery there is an FDG-avid area where the lung is compressed wwith an SUVmax 5.0.
There is an FDG-avid right iliac node (SUVmax 4.2).
Physiologic uptake is seen in the brain, heart GI and GU tracts.
There is a right maxillary sinus retention cyst, bullae in the lungs and a non-FDG-avid cyst in the tail of the pancreas.
FDG-avid spiculated nodule in the left upper lobe concerning for lung cancer.
On the right at the level of the right main pulmonary artery there is an FDG-avid focus (SUVmax = 5.0) where the lung is compressed by pleural effusion without a distinct anatomical correlate.
Right FDG-avid iliac node likely reactive   Brief Hospital Course: This patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on the Vascular Surgery service for bilateral lower limb ischemia (transfer from [**Hospital 69040**] Hospital).
FDG-avid spiculated nodule in the left upper lobe concerning for lung cancer.
On the right at the level of the right main pulmonary artery there is an FDG-avid focus (SUVmax = 5.0) where the lung is compressed by pleural effusion without a distinct anatomical correlate.
Right FDG-avid iliac node likely reactive.
- [**10-25**] Spirometry: There is a mild obstructive ventilatory defect.
There are no prior studies available for comparison.
- [**11-2**]: Cardiopulm stress testing results: Testing showed a reduction in exercise capacity with a maximum oxygen consumption of 25% of predicted (8.4 ml/kg/min) in a test terminated for patient SOB and arm fatigue.
There was no pulmonary mechanical limitation.
The elevated Ve/VCO2 and reduced DLCO from prior testing are consistent with pulmonary vascular disease, however the lack of desaturation indicates that this is not a primary factor in the patient?s exercise limitation.
- [**11-3**]: Cervical mediastinoscopy, flexible bronchoscopy.
4R lower paratracheal nodes (A-B): Thirteen (13) lymph node fragments, all with no evidence of malignancy.2.
2R upper paratracheal nodes (C):Two(2) lymph node fragments, both with no evidence of malignancy.3.
4L lower paratracheal nodes (D):Six (6) lymph node fragments, all with no evidence of malignancy.4.
2L upper paratracheal nodes (E): Three (3) lymph node fragments, all with no evidence of malignancy.5.
7 subcarinal nodes (F-H): Nine (9) lymph node fragments, all with no evidence of malignancy.
- [**11-24**]: T spine films done - No listhesis or fracture.
- [**12-1**]: Seen by psych with the following asessment -  Axis I:   R/O psychosis NOS based on history           R/O alcohol abuse, in forced remission Axis II:  R/O schizotypal personality disorder Axis III: lower extremity ischemia, multiple ulcers AXIS IV:  homeless, socially isolated  RECOMMENDATIONS: At this point, patient is agreeable to discharge to a supported care facility, stating that he recognizes he needs help and cannot care for himself w/o some assistance.
If he vacillates in his decision, that would be a reason to re-explore the question of capacity as expression of choice over time is a component of capacity.
This is what we know is going on right now... " to explain the results of tests, more concrete recommendations for disposition and a timeline for disposition (patient is worried that he will be sent to the street in pain and unprepared).
It may be helpful to put patient on an ATC regimen of pain meds rather than prn, as he appears very worried that somehow his need for pain mgmt will be overlooked.
- CT SCAN for continued baclk pain:  IMPRESSION: 1) No bony destructive lesion identified in the thoracic spine.
3) Irregular spiculated nodule in the left upper lobe, corresponding to the known lung mass .
The wound base remains beefy red granulation tissue 100%.
There is moderate amounts of drainage, nonmalodorous.
Pt remains on a 1st step low air loss mattress and is having back pain and spasms.
Back pain may be worsened by the 1st step mattress and pt may benefit from regular mattress since he is able to turn independently and keep off his gluteal.
