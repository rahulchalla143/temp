Admission Date: [**2139-5-6**]        Discharge Date: [**2139-5-13**]   Service:  CSU   CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient presented to the Emergency Room with new onset chest pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and breast cancer (status post mastectomy with metastatic spread to the spine) who complained of chest pain on the morning prior to admission.
The patient described it as a sharp pressure that did not radiate but was associated with dyspnea and diaphoresis.
The patient states that she has had chest pain in the past which always resolved with nitroglycerin.
The chest pain has been increasing in frequency over the past month.
She denies dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, or exercise limitations due to chest pain, or palpations.
However, the patient does state that she has had pain at rest.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, transient ischemic attack, breast cancer (status post left mastectomy in [**2120**] with metastases to the spine), left upper extremity lymphedema, anxiety disorder, skin cancer, history of peptic ulcer disease in [**2114**], and left leg fracture.
ALLERGIES:  The patient states no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  In general,  the patient was in no acute distress.
There were no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
The abdomen was soft and nontender.
There were no edema.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY-IMAGING:  The patient's electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in V2 through V5.
An echocardiogram showed no wall motion abnormalities and an ejection fraction of 60 percent.
Telemetry revealed a sinus rhythm with a rate of 50 to 60.
Exercise tolerance test done in [**2138-6-20**] with four minutes on a modified [**Doctor First Name **] protocol and stopped secondary to dizziness with a heart rate of 105.
No electrocardiogram changes.
No wall motion abnormalities.
On [**2139-5-7**] the patient went for a cardiac catheterization which showed an ejection fraction of 60 percent with no mitral regurgitation.
The left main with a distal 70 percent hazy lesion at the bifurcation with the left anterior descending and circumflex.
The left anterior descending with diffuse disease and 99 percent mid segment lesion.
Second diagonal and the left anterior descending have TIMI-I flow.
The circumflex was a nondominant vessel with severe disease.
The second obtuse marginal had a 90 percent lesion at the origin.
The right coronary artery was the dominant vessel with an ostial 70 percent lesion, and also serial lesions in the distal vessel.
In summary, the patient had a coronary artery bypass grafting times three with a saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending, a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal, and a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.
Attempts to wean her from the ventilator were unsuccessful as she developed a severe respiratory acidosis when she was switched to pressure support ventilation.
The patient was noted to have some thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of only 48,000.
There was no edema.
The left lower extremity incision with Steri-Strips - open to air - clean and dry.
The patient was noted to have a large ecchymotic area on her right neck which resulted from her central line placement in the preoperative theater.
Laboratory data with her hematocrit level pending.
Breast cancer; status post mastectomy of the left breast with metastatic spread to the spine.
Left upper extremity lymphedema.
Anxiety disorder.
History of transient ischemic attacks.
History of peptic ulcer disease.
