Over a few months, I had observed the gradual development of a small ventral hernia.
However, on the day of surgery, the patient presented to the medical oncology clinic with acute enlargement of the hernia.

He had Vicryl mesh in place and a wound VAC covering his abdomen.
He was hypertensive and tachycardic in the PACU.
Acute Pain Service was called and he was started on a Dilaudid PCA, with good effect.
#Respiratory On POD 1, he had respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of 24 and brief apnea episodes.
The patient was transferred to the ICU for continued care of his respiratory distress.
He was stable in the ICU and the respiratory issues was likely related to sleep apnea.
On POD 37 ([**2142-6-13**]) he was transferred to the ICU secondary to respiratory distress.
He was intubated soon after arriving to the ICU and had metabolic alkalosis.
A CT showed no evidence of a PE, a CXR showed some CHF, and a MRI of his brain showed no acute changes.
A bronchoscopy was performed that showed increased secretions in the left mainstem.
He received Lasix, with good response, for increased SOB on [**2142-6-23**].
He received aggressive pulmonary toilet for suspected pneumonia.
#Code Status DR. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] met with the family on [**2142-6-14**] and [**2142-6-16**] to discuss further care for this patient.
He was thought likely to have ATN as the etiology.
He may intravascularly depleted secondary to a low albumin.
He and his wife were instructed to choose high protein, low sodium, low potassium and low phosphate foods.
Due to the abdominal wound, activity was limited to ensure proper wound healing and decrease the risk of dehiscence.
His abdomen remained soft, with decreased bowel sounds.
A air mattress was in place to help maintain skin integrity and he wore pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.
The VAC dressing was again changed on [**2142-5-14**] and [**2142-5-19**], with granulation tissue noted.

The abdominal wound had a VAC dressing in place; the thigh wound was dressed.
His mental status continued to wax and wane with periods of confusion as his hospitalization continued.
#Pain Consult He was complaining of increased pain ([**2142-6-19**]), especially to his back.
The Chronic Pain service recommended medication adjustments and his pain was in much better control.
He was requiring more Morphine on HD 53 for increased pain.
The Pain service recommended increased fentanyl patch from to 200mcg/hr, increased oxycontin to 40mg [**Hospital1 **].
# Urology A urine culture on [**2142-5-14**] showed P. Aeruginosa and Gram negative rods.
An ultrasound revealed a right-sided epididymitis with complex hydrocele.
A repeat urine culture showed E.coli resistant to Cipro.
A urine culture on [**2142-5-26**] revealed Klebsiella Pneumoniae, pan resistant.
It was thought that due to his poor performance status and overall condition that resumed chemo would have little benefits greater than burdens.
