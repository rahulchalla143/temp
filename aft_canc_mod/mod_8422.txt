Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation & bronchoscopy liver biopsy Left internal jugular central venous catheter placement Right radial arterial catheter placement bone marrow biopsy tracheostomy placement   History of Present Illness: This is a 72 yo F with h/o DM, OSA, right hemispheric CVA in the past, ?seizure disorder admitted on [**2146-12-4**] with chief complaint of ataxia and unsteady gait.
She hit her head against her bed room door without falling, no LOC.
On admission she had left lateral nystagmus, increased tone thoughout, brisk reflexes, weakness noted in left arm and leg suggestive UMN pattern.
Prior neuro exams only suggestive of mild left hand weakness after CVA [**2144**].
CT performed in the ED showed a 5 mm hypodensity in the right basal ganglia.
MRI showed occlusion of the R ICA with watershed infarction in the right hemisphere on [**12-4**].
Repeat MR today showed extension of the right infarct with multiple other small watershed infarcts in the thalmus and left hemisphere.
The patient also presented with pancytopenia making anticoagulation difficult.
The decision to initiate heparin therapy had been postponed however was started on the evening of transfer given her worsening symptoms.
In addition, she was noted to have a nodule on a CXR performed in the ED, CT of the chest showed multiple nodules concerning for either infection vs. malignancy.
CT abd/pelvis showed hpodensities in the liver and spleen with multiple lymph nodes however no mass.
As stated above, she was noted to be pancytopenic suggesting a possible underlying bone marrow process.
She was transfered to the MICU for monitoring given initiation of anticoagulation in the setting of thrombocytopenia as well as for tight BP control.
ROS (per records), she denied any CP, SOB, palpitations, HA, vision changes or weakness.
Past Medical History: 1)Diabetes mellitus - diet controlled 2)OSA - on BiPAP 12/8 3)Cataract in the left eye 4)CVA/TIA (positive MRI) - right frontal with L arm/hand hemiparesis; etiology likely moderate degree stenosis of the ICA in the cavernous region, stable on recent CTA 5)Asthma 6)Hypercholesterolemia 7)Seizure?

5 mm hypodensity in the right basal ganglia, either cyst or prior infarct.
CXR [**12-4**] 2.5 cm and 8 mm nodular opacities projecting over right mid lung, highly concerning for malignancy.
Multiple consolidations and ill-defined nodules and numerous small nodules mostly in centrilobular distribution.
The finding is most likely representing infectious process, likely bacterial infection, however, given the appearance, possibilities of fungal infection or tuberculosis infection should be considered.
2.Given the liver lesion and lymphadenopathy described below, some of the nodules especially larger nodules can represent metastasis if there is underlying malignancy.
Bilateral axillary and right paratracheal lymphadenopathy, also concerning for malignancy.
Multiple hypodense liver lesions, only partially visualized, of unknown origin however is strongly worrisme for metastasis from underlying malignancy such as colon or breast cancer.
Please correlate clinically, and please perform dedicated abdominal imaging such as ultrasound or contrast enhanced CT if renal function permits.
MRA Brain [**12-4**]: Occlusion of the right ICA with watershed infarction in the right hemisphere.
Occlusion or severe stenosis of the left vertebral artery.
CTA Head & Neck [**12-6**] Complete occlusion of the right internal carotid artery.
With the constellation of findings of multiple pulmonary nodules, ill-defined liver and splenic lesions, and lymphadenopathy, metastatic disease cannot be excluded.
There is unknown total occlusion of the right internal carotid artery.
There is some flow in the right MCA, primarily from the anterior communicating artery and right A1 segment, which appears to be small.
The current study extends further superiorly showing enlargement of the distal right anterior cerebral artery, suggesting that it supplies collaterals to the right MCA territory.
No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis or abscess identified.

[**12-10**] bronchial washings: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
No stenosis of the left carotid.
[**12-15**] Chest CT:IMPRESSION: New moderately severe pulmonary edema and increasing pleural effusions suggest cardiac decompensation.
The multiple pulmonary nodules which previously developed over several days likely represent disseminated infection, including septic emboli, not metastases.
Bilateral consolidation is a combination of atelectasis and pneumonia.
Interval evolution of bilateral infarcts.
Hyperdensity sighin a portion of the largest right frontal infarct is concerning for hemorrhagic transformation, minimal in degree.
New sinus opacification as described above, likely inflammatory in origin, and possibly related to the intubated status of the patient.
NOTE: There are secretions in the [**Last Name (un) **]- and oropharynx, also presumably related to intubation of the patient.
[**12-16**] neck soft tissue USN: IMPRESSION: Abnormally enlarged right supraclavicular lymph nodes.
[**12-16**] TTE:Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-12-9**], a small pericardial effusion is now present; otherwise no major change.
[**12-31**] TTE: MPRESSION: Trace aortic regurgitation and mild aortic valve sclerosis.
Compared with the prior study of [**2146-12-16**] (images reviewed), the severity of  mitral regurgitation has decreased.
Aortic regurgitation and pulmonary artery  systolic pressure are similar (and were overestimated on the prior study).
Overall worse appearance of lungs which may be due to a combination of cardiac failure and progressive infection.
Improvement in overall size of right pleural effusion, but evidence of further loculation.
Small left pleural effusion also present.
Free abdominal air presumably due to recent gastrostomy tube placement.
[**1-2**] LENI: No femoral or popliteal DVT was demonstrated in either the right or left legs.
[**1-6**] UE USN: No evidence of DVT in the left upper extremity.
No significant change in the appearance of the pleural effusions and diffuse ground glass opacities and _____ parenchymal nodules when compared to the prior study.
Overall, no significant change in the quantity of ascitic fluid, which has redistributed into the lower pelvis.

Some lymphocytes, rare groups of mesothelial cells and blood.
[**12-16**] BM aspirate and core biopsy: Markedly hypercellular bone marrow with trilineage dysplasia and increased blasts (18-20%) consistent with an evolving acute leukemia.
See note.Note:  The findings of marrow hypercellularity and trilineage dysplasia, in a patient with pancytopenia, are in keeping with involvement by a myelodysplastic syndrome.
Blasts represent approximately 18-20% of aspirate differential suggestive of an evolving acute leukemia.
Note:  There are several granulomatous necrotizing lesions in the core.
There is focal fibrosis deposition in relation to the granulomas.
However, a concurrent wedge biopsy of the lung, contains similar necrotizing lesions as in this liver, where there are acid fast organisms present consistent with mycobacteria (please see report: S07-3791).
An iron stain demonstrates increased stainable iron.
CD5 stains scattered T-lymphocytes.
CD68 stains Kupffer cells and lesional histiocytes.
CD3 stains scattered T-lymphocytes in the parenchyma and granulomas.

1) Fevers: Patient has been intermittently febrile since admission and overall picture concerning for underlying infection vs. malignancy given pulmonary, liver, and splenic lesions, ?BM infiltrative process leading to pancytopenia.
Acute CVA could produce fever.
Also, persistently colonized with E. Coli on sputum cultures, but has received several courses of antibiotics, including Ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin/tazobactam.
However, sputum cultures still growing E. Coli on [**1-17**].
TTE was negative for endocarditis, and TEE was deferred due to inability reach family for consent.
2) Evolving Watershed Infarcts: Repeat MRI showed evolving infarcts in watershed distribution with progressive neurological decline.
DDx influces embolic from tight R ICA lesions vs. brain mets vs. infectious such as TB involvement of CNS.
She was started on a heparin gtt which was stopped due to thrombocytopenia and positive HIT assay.
embolic infarcts; however, no evidence of vegetations or cardiac thrombi.
In the setting of her respiratory failure on [**12-9**], head was reimaged but CT without any interval change.
3) Respiratory failure - Patient with new onset respiratory distress on the evening of [**12-9**] with ABG 7.4/35/48.
She was intubated emergently; however, the trigger for her respiratory distress is undetermined, as CXR is clear and there is no significant underlying pulmonary process to which this can be attributed.
CT head was performed emergently, but was negative for evolution of her neurologic picture.
Mental status moderately improved, with compensated metabolic acidosis on vent.
Continues to have difficulties with weaning on pressure support ventilation, with RSBI consistently greater than 200. .
4) Pulmonary tuberculosis with liver/spleen granulomas: On [**12-16**] pt had right sided VATS, right supraclavic LN, and liver biopsy done.
Biopsy showed granuloma suspicious for infectious process.
Sputum cx also + for AFB on culture but never smear positive.
of drug fever was proposed so RIPE was held for three days, pt given STM/levaquin instead of rifampin, but she continued to spike.
She grew AFB from BAL or sputum on [**3-22**], and [**12-12**] but was never smear positive even on concentrated smear before treatment.
She has received treatment continuously since [**12-22**] (>2 weeks) and has no clinical symptoms of TB at this time.
Patient was transfused as needed for PRBC and platelets.
No evidence of malaria on interpretation of peripheral smear.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
