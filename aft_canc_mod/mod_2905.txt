Admission Date:  [**2187-9-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2187-11-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2136-5-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Betalactams  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**] Chief Complaint: Diarrhea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation x 2, central line placement, pericardial drain placement  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] went to clinic today for evaluation of diarrhea which has been worsening over the last week.
She was seen in clinic on Saturday and Sunday and was noted to have escalation of diarrhea at that time.
Advised him at that time that it was very important she come in due to the diarrhea and her previous low K. A second call from the husband reported they would be in shortly and he also reported that she had a fever to 100.5.
She reports that she is having pain in her knee because she slipped in stool last night while trying to get to the bathroom.
In clinic, she had a fever to 98.8.
Past Medical History:  Oncologic History: [**Known firstname **] is a 51-year-old woman who was admitted to [**Hospital6 33**] on [**2187-2-4**] after a period of fevers, myalgias, tender cervical adenopathy, and worsening chronic back pain.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and bone marrow aspirate and biopsy was notable for acute myeloid leukemia with monocytic differentiation.
On the second day after admission she went into a DIC with onset of acute renal failure, which resolved with IV fluids.
She was treated with 7 and 3(cytarabine and idarubicin) with subsequent complications of prolonged febrile neutropenia, VRE bacteremia, cephalitis, and mucositis.
She also was noted for some mental status changes concerning for CNS involvement.
The lumbar puncture showed no specific malignant cells, but high monocyte count was concerning for leptomeningeal spread and she received five doses of intrathecal chemotherapy, two doses of methotrexate, and three doses of ARC.
Unfortunately, she was noted for persistent disease and received a cycle of clofarabine.
She required an admission for neutropenic fever.
Her day 15 bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showed no evidence of disease.
POST-TRANSPLANT COURSE: [**Known firstname 60231**] post transplant course has been complicated by a diffuse erythroderma rash with marked pruritus and dull epigastric discomfort.
EGD was done which showed acute mild GVHD.
Cachectic appearing.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear no lesions or petechial hemmorhages.
Neck: supple, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
No other rashes evident.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2187-5-30**], a moderate circumferential pericardial effusion is now present.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75-80%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears circumferential but is distributed primarily posterolateral to the heart with patient in left lateral decubitus position.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to large circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**2187-10-5**]:Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility (focal mid RV free wall akinesis).
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is a large pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2187-9-27**], the pericardial effusion is slightly larger but there is no tamponade.
The RV is now more dilated with focal free wall hypokinesis with evidence of pressure/volume overload.
Acute RV strain?
Acute pulmonary embolism?
Significant mucosal edema evident in the transverse and descending [**Month/Day/Year 499**].
New bilateral pleural effusions and increase in the size of pericardial effusions.
New scattered areas of nodular ground-glass opacities bilaterally, which raises concern for infection including atypical infections such as viral and fungal etiologies.
Focal airspace consolidation of the left lower lobe at site of prior thoracentesis that may be developing infection with adjacent ground glass opacities that may be a component of reexpansion pulmonary edema.
Unchanged to mildly increased moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
Decrease in size of the left pleural effusion status post thoracentesis.
Moderate pericardial effusion, unchanged.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism to the subsegmental levels.
Moderately large bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusions.
The left pleural effusion has significantly worsened since [**2187-9-29**].
Dense consolidated left lower lobe on the prior study is replaced by atelectatis.
Bilateral upper lobe consolidation has progressed and may represent viral pneumonia, central edema or graft versus host reaction.
[**2187-9-25**] ENDOSCOPIC BIOPSY: [**Month/Day/Year **], sigmoid, biopsy:              - Colonic mucosa with mucosal edema and mildly distorted crypt architecture; no active inflammation identified.
- No viral cytopathic effect seen; immunohistochemical staining for CMV is negative with adequate controls.
Infectious work-up was negative and her course was complicated by AFIB with RVR requiring admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Echo at that time showed a moderate pericardial effusion without e/o tamponade which was monitored on echo x 4 and remained stable until subsequently in course.
#ICU Course 2: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 51-year-old woman with a history of AML day day 122+ s/p double cord allogeneic transplant who was admitted with fevers and diarrhea s/p 3 day [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay for hypotension and tachycardia now with hypotension in setting of rapid heart rate.
Initial episode of hypotension felt to be due to a combination of dehydration and atrial flutter.
Echo at that time showed a moderate pericardial effusion without e/o tamponade.
However, she became hypotensive with SBPs in mid-60s and she felt generally unwell.
She was afebrile with normal oxygen saturations.
Daily pulsus was checked and demonstrated no abnormality.
She once again became febrile to 100-101, and was placed on empiric broad spectrum antibiotics including daptomycin for her history of VRE, and aztreonam, though she continued to spike.
She developed watery diarrhea on [**2187-9-23**], and underwent a negative infectious workup.
A CT torso was explored to evaluate the cause of her persistent fevers, and it demonstrated some mild pleural effusions and transverse/descending colitis.
GI was consulted and she underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy on [**2187-9-27**] demonstrating diffuse erythema of the sigmoid [**Date Range 499**].
Biopsies were taken, though they did not show evidence of suspected graft versus host disease or viral cytopathic changes.
Her diarrhea subsequently stopped within a few days.
She developed shortness of breath with new oxygen requirement, and given her moderate-large pleural effusions, she underwent thoracentesis of the left pleural space on [**2187-9-28**], and 800cc of clear fluid was withdrawn.
Pleural fluid analysis yielded a transudative fluid that showed atypical cells, yet pathology did not reveal signs of malignancy.
Her respiratory status improved acutely, though several hours post-procedure, she became suddenly short of breath with audible wheezing and diffuse crackles heard throughout the lung fields.
CXR demonstrated a post-expansion pulmonary edema and she was diuresed with slight improvement.
Following further respiratory distress, she again underwent CTA of the chest, which demonstrated worsened pleural effusions, with a moderate to large bilateral pleural effusion, in addition to diffuse bilateral upper lobe consolidations.
Pleural fluid analysis demonstrated a transudative process.
No cytologic of the BAL fluid could be completed due to cell fragility.
No malignant cells were seen on pleural fluid cytology.
Cultures were negative of the pleural fluid and BAL washings.
Following her bronchoscopy, she developed respiratory distress with desaturations and was directly transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] without returning first to the floor.
She was noted to have asymmetric lower extremity weakness that was initially felt to be secondary to deconditioning, though her right lower leg was peristently weaker than her left.
Her CSF analysis demonstrated leukcytosis to 32 with 92% lymphocytes.
No malignant cells were seen.
#ICU course 3: Respiratory failure s/p bronchoscopy and pleurocentesis.
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 60232**] developed sudden hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation on [**2187-10-2**] after bronchoscopy and pleural tap.
Factors initially causing her to be in respiratory distress include a large multifocal pneumonia, her known pleural effusions, and also likely the effect of bronchoscopy fluid in her lungs.
She was treated with broad-spectrum Abx (Vanc, Cefepime, Cipro, Flagyl with multiple prophylactic medications).
Pt initially with hypotension and low urine output concerning for sepsis in context of PNA.
Also becoming hyponatremic with high BNP concerning for vol overload.
Head CT negative for acute change.
CTA did not show PE and showed mild improvement in ground glass opacities bilaterally but increase in size of pericardial effusion.
ECHO showed no evidence of tamponade and cardiology post-poned possible pericardiocentesis.
Pt was extubated on [**10-14**] but with significant agitation and tachypnea, so was re-intubated on [**10-17**].
CNS also positive for AML.
Course further complicated by SVT requiring eletric cardioversion and amio ggt converted to PO amio, continued pressor dependence, skin impairments of the arms bilaterally with wound culture positive for coag + staph.
