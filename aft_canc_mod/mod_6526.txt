Subsequently developed fevers to 102 intermittantly.
Per her transfer paperwork she was transfused blood and platelet products, but has remained pancytopenic.
She was found to have pulmonary infiltrates and nodules on CT chest, negative for PE.
She was also found to be anemic and thrombocytopenic with HCT in the high 20s and platelets in the low 100s, new since [**3-12**].
When antibiotics were stopped, she had recurrence of symptoms and was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] MC and transfered to Catholic MC.
Blood cultures were postive for pseudomonas and ECHO negative for endocarditis.
CT continued to show lung nodules and LUL infiltrated.
Recieved zosyn, gentamycin, vancomycin, amikacin and linezolid and had persistent thrombocytopenia and anemia in spite of multiple blood transfusions.
She developed additional antibodies and evidence of hemolysis with increased LDH and retic count.
She was then readmitted showtly after with flank pain and discharged.
She had C. diff colitis in [**Month (only) **].
Past Medical History: Pancytopenia Hemolytic anemia Hyponatremia MRSA nares screen positive at OSH CAD s/p MI/CABG in [**2131**] Chest pain, work up negative for ACS at OSH HTN Hyperlipidemia COPD Hypothyroidism Depression B12 deficiency Pseudomonas bactermia s/p mulitple antibiotic treatments including Zosyn, gentamicin, vancomycin, amikacin, and linezolid  Social History: The patient endorses a remote smoking history.
She lives at [**Location (un) **] nursing home with her daughter in [**Name (NI) **], but has been in and out of the hospital and rehab since [**Month (only) 958**]  Family History: Non-Contributory  Physical Exam: Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] ROS: GEN: + fevers, - Chills, - Weight Loss, - Night Sweats, - Pruritis EYES: - Photophobia, - Visual Changes HEENT: - Oral/Gum bleeding CARDIAC: - Chest Pain, - Palpitations, + Edema GI: - Nausea, - Vomitting, - Diarhea, - Abdominal Pain, - Constipation, - Hematochezia, + rectal pain on BM PULM: - Dyspnea, - Cough, - Hemoptysis HEME: - Bleeding, - Lymphadenopathy GU: - Dysuria, - hematuria, - Incontinence SKIN: - Rash ENDO: - Heat/Cold Intolerance MSK: - Myalgia, - Arthralgia, - Back Pain NEURO: - Numbness, - Weakness, - Vertigo, - Headache  PHYSICAL EXAM: VSS: 95.7, 90/48, 85, 18, 93% GEN: NAD, anisarca, Pale Pain: 0/0 HEENT: PERRLA, EOMI, MMM, - OP Lesions PUL: CTA B/L COR: RRR, S1/S2, - MRG ABD: NT/ND, +BS, - CVAT EXT: - CC, 2+ pitting edema NEURO: CAOx3, strength 5/5 UE/LE, CN II-XII wnl  Pertinent Results: [**2145-7-16**] 05:40AM BLOOD WBC-3.4* RBC-2.85* Hgb-8.2* Hct-25.2* MCV-88 MCH-28.8 MCHC-32.6 RDW-17.9* Plt Ct-66* [**2145-7-23**] 12:03AM BLOOD WBC-16.2* RBC-1.87*# Hgb-5.9*# Hct-18.1*# MCV-97 MCH-31.5 MCHC-32.6 RDW-17.4* Plt Ct-58* [**2145-7-16**] 05:40AM BLOOD Glucose-82 UreaN-20 Creat-1.0 Na-130* K-3.8 Cl-95* HCO3-26 AnGap-13 [**2145-7-23**] 12:03AM BLOOD Glucose-409* UreaN-32* Creat-1.4* Na-128* K-6.1* Cl-100 HCO3-13* AnGap-21* .
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the entire distal two-thirds of the left ventricle, and relative preservation of the basal one-third (LVEF <20%).
This is consistent with either an extensive infarction or transient apical ballooning syndrome ("Takosubo cardiomyopathy").
No left ventricular thrombus is seen.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Extensive regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction as described above.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2145-7-20**], left ventricular systolic function has significantly deteriorated, and severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation is greater.
Brief Hospital Course: 76F with compliacted PMH, with new dx large Bcell lymphoma c/b hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, who was transfered to ICU for hypotension on [**7-22**] and died on [**7-23**].
Brief hospital course: Course c/b hyponatremia and oliguria.
She was hypotensive on floor with SBPs in the 80s.
This seemed to maintain her SBPs and renal perfusion.
She also was noted to have profound pancytopenia w hemolytic anemia.
On evening of [**7-21**], she began complaining of chest pain around 11 pm.
On EKG, there were no ST changes or TWI, but there was loss of R wave progression.
On arrival to ICU, there was initial concern for a distributive shock, possibly infectious.
Shortly thereafter, she experienced CP and acute SOB.
CXR and exam c/w pulm edema.
It showed new anterior wall hypo/akinesis of LV.
Cardiogenic shock was considered strongly as etiology of hypotension.
Exam fairly benign but we were concerned about mesenteric ischemia, RP bleed, or other acute process.
Family requested invasive measures if meaningful recovery possible.
