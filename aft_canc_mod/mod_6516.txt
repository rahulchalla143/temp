(Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**2188-12-15**]: AVNRT ablation by EP cardiology   History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old female with history of NSCLC with liver metastases s/p right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy with taxol, carboplatin, and avastin.
She was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 79530**] for managment of recent bilateral pulmonary embolism after presenting with SOB in her [**Date range (1) 5564**], Dr.[**Name (NI) 3279**], office on [**2188-10-21**].
Around [**2188-12-7**] she started noticing calf and ankle swelling and tightness.
She presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2188-12-10**] where she was evaluated by the orthopedic trauma service for concern for hematoma-related left calf compartment syndrome.
She recovered well from that procedure without much pain or discomfort.
[**Known lastname **] was thought to be in atrial fibrillation with RVR with rate in the 170s on the floor.
She denied chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, or dizziness at that time.
She did endorse constipation and a cough productive of sputum.
On [**2188-12-15**] the AVNRT was ablated; there were multiple ectopic atrial beats noted.
She denies pain except for pain in her leg at the site of her recent surgery.
Has been OOB with PT in MICU, with minimal weight bearing on LLE.
Denies fevers, chills, urinary or bowel habit changes.
Prior to her episode of pulmonary embolus in [**10-15**], she felt in her usual state of health.
The pt denied recent unintended weight loss, fevers, night sweats, chills, headaches, dizziness or vertigo, changes in hearing or vision, neck stiffness,  dysphagia, odynophagia, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, cough, hemoptysis, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, orthpnea, joint pain.
Non small cell lung cancer (adenocarcinoma)     *[**2186**]: T1 N0 2.6-cm moderately differentiated      adenocarcinoma s/p right middle lobectomy at [**Hospital1 2177**] [**2186-7-11**] by      Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
*[**2187**]: increasing right lower lung nodule.
[**2187-7-31**] biopsy      consistent with non-small cell carcinoma, favor      adenocarcinoma.
CT-guided biopsy of liver      [**7-15**]: showed poorly differentiated metastatic NSCLC.
Allergic rhinitis.
Gastroesophaeal reflux disease.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: emphysema plus    restriction secondary to volume loss from lobectomy.
Family History: There is no family history of any lung disease.
Her brother had some type of cancer, which was either a thyroid cancer or throat cancer, the patient is not sure.
Mild pedal edema LLE - NVI.
compartments mildly tense.
Calf is markedly swollen with ecchymossis over the medial malleolus.
Neck: supple, no significant JVD or carotid bruits appreciated.
Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally, no wheezes, rhonchi or rales.
Cardiac: RR, nl S1 S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated.
Abdomen: NABS, soft, NT, ND, no rebound or guarding.
+2 non-pitting edema bil [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]>R, 2+ radial, DP pulses b/l difficult to appreciate secondary to edema, but [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 6816**] are warm and well perfused.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
No abnormal movements noted.
No dysarthria, intention or action tremor.
No deep venous thrombosis.
Large avascular hypoechoic collection on the left medial calf at site of palpable mass.
Correlate clinically as this may represent a seroma, less likely infected collection.
CT Chestm11/5/09: Impression: 1) Decreased pre-tracheal lymph nodes, with stable right hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy.
2) Stable large subpulmonic effusion associated with thickening of the overlying pleura and enhancement suggesting metastatic disease.
5) Mild coronary artery and aortic valvular calcification.
6) Enlargement of the left adrenal gland is stable, probably metastasis.
7) No pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection or aneurysm.
DISCHARGE LABS: [**2188-12-18**] 06:50AM BLOOD WBC-5.5 RBC-3.42* Hgb-9.6* Hct-30.4* MCV-89 MCH-28.1 MCHC-31.6 RDW-16.1* Plt Ct-365 [**2188-12-18**] 06:50AM BLOOD Glucose-102 UreaN-13 Creat-0.7 Na-139 K-4.3 Cl-100 HCO3-34* AnGap-9 [**2188-12-18**] 06:50AM BLOOD Calcium-8.4 Phos-2.5* Mg-1.7  Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old female with history of NSCLC metastatic to the liver, recent bilateral PE diagnosis s/p fasciotomy on [**2188-12-10**] for left calf hematoma-related compartment syndrome.
She was initially transferred to MICU for tachycardia and hypotension and is s/p AVNRT ablation on [**2188-12-15**].
Her HCT post-op was 24 and she was given 2 units of PRBCs for acute blood loss anemia.
Carotid massage and valsalva maneuvers were also unsuccessful.
This then recurred a doszen times, each episode was symptomatic with SOB and systolic in 80s; they all terminated with 6mg IV adenosine.
The frequency of these episodes decreased with esmolol drip.
PE: Oncology comfortable with pt being on coumadin over lovenox for PE even in setting of malignancy given her significant complication on lovenox.
AV nodal non-reentry tachycardia: EKG on admission to MICU appeared to be narrow complex tachycardia.
Underlying causes were thought to be due to recent surgery, 2 missed doses of diltiazem on the day prior, new pulmonary embolism, hyperthyroidism, or myocardial infarction.
-Status post ablation on [**2188-12-15**], HR and BP have been stable since.
Bilateral pulmonary emboli:: Likely secondary to known malignancy.
Left lower extremity compartment syndrome: Due to hematoma that patient developed while on lovenox for bilateral pulmonary emboli.
COPD: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] has emphysema superimposed on a baseline of restriction related to volume loss from her lobectomy.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Constipation.
Non small cell lung cancer with liver metastases   Discharge Condition: Stable, NSR at 96 bpm, oxygenating 96% on room air.
Discharge Instructions: Mrs. [**Known lastname **], you were admitted to the hospital because of left lower leg swelling.
You were also noted to have an irregular heartbeat, and underwent a procedure called an ablation to fix this arrythmia.
Please call your doctor or go to the nearest emergency room if you have increasing shortness of breath, chest pain, you lose consciousness, have a fever >100.4, you have diarrhea or vomiting for more than 24 hours, you have bleeding, or other concerning symptoms.
