Exploratory laparotomy, drainage of abdominal abscess.
Oversewing of bleeding site proximal duodenum 4.
He had an "upset stomach" and also had a GI bleed, which showed a duodenal tumor.
He underwent endoscopy and found the tumor in the third portion of the duodenum and biopsied, which showed adenocarcinoma.
He has had no further bleeding, but he has been somewhat tired since the blood loss.
Anemia 2.
HTN 3.
Duodenal mass 5.
Family History: There is a family history of colon cancer in a brother at age 43 and his mother died of brain tumor.

His immediate post-op course was complicated by development of significant leakage from the surgical wound with seroma seen on CT scan [**2131-3-12**] (persistent large fluid collection in the duodenal resection bed, suggestive of seroma with a hemorrhagic component).
0n POD 7 from the duodenal resection, he developed RLQ, incisional pain and right shoulder pain.
He subsquently became oliguric, with percipitous rise in Cr and was transferred to TICU for becoming progressively somulent, tachypnec, with increased work of breathing.
His post-op course was complicated by atrial fibrillation requiring amiodarone gtt and diltiazem gtt for rate control.
On POD 19 from the initial duodenal carcinoma resection ([**2131-3-21**]), he developed coffee ground NGT aspirates that progressed to bloody output with a 5 point Hct decrease.
Endoscopy by GI in the SICU showed bleeding from proximal to the duodenal anastamosis.
GI injected epinephrine as well as applied four endoclips with partial hemostasis at the anastomotic site.
However, a small but significant amount of residual bleeding was present, so the patient returned to the OR for the 3rd time for oversewing of the anastamosis, as well as J-tube placement.
The patient's duodenal resection was additionally complicated by developement of a pancreatic leak, as noted by milkly white drainage from JP drain with remarkably high amylase level ([**Numeric Identifier **] at discharge).
MRCP with secretin stimulus showed normal response to secretin with expected transient caliber change in the pancreatic duct in the head and body, although the study was limited due to artifact from surgical sutures.
During his hospitalization, the patient was given TPN for nutrition, and after J-tube placement was started on tube feeds, which he tolerated well.
The patient's pain was treated with dialudid PCA during most of his hospitalization.
Despite difficulty with A. fib with RVR during this hospitalization as noted above, his rate was well-controlled on Metoprolol at time of discharge.
At the time of discharge on [**2131-3-31**], the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating tube feeds, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for sleep.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Oxycodone-Acetaminophen 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every 4-6 hours as needed for pain for 30 days: Do not drive while taking this medcation.
Disp:*120 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital6 18346**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: 1) duodenal adenocarcinoma s/p duodenal resection and duodenojejunostomy, 2) atrial fibrillation with RVR, 3) pancreatic leak, 4) sepsis, 5) abdominal abscess, 6) upper GI bleeding  Secondary: 1) GERD, 3) hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] to the general surgery service for duodenal resection and duodenojejunostomy for duodenal adenocarcinoma.
Your course was complicated by development of a abdominal abscess with peritonitis (inflammation of the abdominal cavity).
You were later found to have a pancreatic leak.
This was treated with injections by GI as well as by oversewing of the bleeding area in the OR.
Return to the ER if: * If you are vomiting and cannot keep in fluids or your medications.
* If you have shaking chills, fever greater than 101.5 (F) degrees or 38 (C) degrees, increased redness, swelling or discharge from incision, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or anything else that is troubling you.
* Any serious change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms that concern you.
* Do not drive or operate heavy machinery while taking any narcotic pain medication.
You may have constipation when taking narcotic pain medications (oxycodone, percocet, vicodin, hydrocodone, dilaudid, etc.
Followup Instructions: Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for an appointment.
