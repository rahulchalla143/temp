Admission Date:  [**2186-8-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2186-8-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2120-3-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**] Chief Complaint: Pneumonia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracentesis   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 68645**] is a 66 yo M w/PMHx of Stage III metastatic NSCLC ([**7-/2184**]), sleep apnea, diabetes with nephropathy who was transferred from an OSH for mental status changes and possible PNA.
He was found to have acute renal insufficiency with rise in creatinine to 4.0 from baseline 1.5 ([**8-4**]).
After his first treatment, he was hospitalized for hypoxia [**12-22**] malignant pleural effusion (per wife's report).
He did have some confusion and new changes in motor function during that stay, but CT head was negative.
On [**8-12**], he received oxycontin for pain (prior to this he had been receiving oxycodone).
He developed a fever to 101 on day of admission.
Given hypercarbia and possible need for BIPAP, he was admitted to the MICU.
A pleural effusion was tapped on [**8-17**] and was negative for malignant cells.
His mental status, ARF and hyperkalemia improved and he was called out to the floor, still on 4liters NC.
CAD s/p MI [**2174**], PCI with BMS 3.
Diabetes melitus 4.
Hyperlipidemia 5.
Sleep Apnea 9.
Peripheral neuropathy s/p taxane 10.
History of flash pulmonary edema   Social History: Denies alcohol or IVDU Positive tobacco use  Family History: NC~  Physical Exam: VS: 96.9 BP 96/60 HR 102 RR 18 O2sat 96% 4L Gen: Mildly Ill appearing, enlarged neck, arousable, responding to all questions.
HEENT: Thick neck, w/ edema and induration on L > R. MM dry.
No murmurs or rubs.
Lungs: Dullness to percussion over right lung, with minimal breath sounds.
Distant breath sounds.
No organomegaly.
Trace pretibial edema.
Left upper extremity markedly swollen.
Able to recall meds and recent medical course.
Diffuse airspace opacity within the right lung fields represents atelectasis versus pneumonia.
Please correlate clinically as there are no prior radiographs available for comparison.
Interval removal of fluid with slight improved aeration of the right lung with persistent large opacity in the right mid lung zone, which consists of tumor and atelectasis.
Persistent asymmetric pulmonary edema.
No evidence of acute intracranial process.
Please note that metastatic disease cannot be excluded by this non-contrast study.
CT head ([**2186-8-20**]): No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or significant change from the prior study.
This effusion appears amenable to ultrasound-guided thoracentesis and can be performed with personnel from the referring team to assist in positioning and monitoring patient.
Renal US ([**2186-8-16**]): No evidence of obstruction.
Large right hilar mass with bronchial obstruction, extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy and axillary lymphadenopathy and multiple left lung and possible thoracic vertebral metastases.
Bilateral pleural and small pericardial effusion.
Possible right pleural tumore implant.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 66 yo M w/PMHx sx metastatic lung cancer s/p chemotherapy, recent hospital stay for pneumonia presents from rehab with altered mental status and acute renal failure with rise in creatinine from 1.0 to 4.0.
Patient afebrile since.
New leukocytosis to 12 on [**8-20**], but was been asymptomatic.
ARF: Etiology of renal failure was likely multifactorial including IV contrast from recent admission, continuation of nephrotoxic medications including LMWH, losartan, and furosemide, as well as recent antibiotics, including ceftriaxone and vancomycin.
Hyperkalemia: Was likely secondary to renal failure.
MS changes- This may have been secondary to oxycontin vs hypercarbia vs uremia.
Was getting radiation for postobstructive pneumonia.
Plan on discharge was for same-day followup at [**Company 2860**] for XRT with scheduling of appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23**] at that time  6.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for agitation, sleep.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: greater [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 269**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PNA ARF hyperkalemia mental status change pleural effusion NSLCA DM history of UGIB   Discharge Condition: Good; improved   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a diangosis of pneumonia, acute renal failure and mental status change.
You are being given a prescription for ultram which has worked well for your pain while here.
Additionally, you are being treated for a pneumonia and will be given a total of 14 days of antibiotics.
