Admission Date:  [**2167-2-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2167-2-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2084-3-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**] Chief Complaint: Difficulty in breathing  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 82 year-old female with a history of NSCLC (stage IV) who presents with shortness of breath.
The patient was in her usual state of health until the evening before admission when she began to feel somewhat short of breath.
She also reports a few day history of a non-productive cough.
Denies sick contacts, recent travel or sedentary lifestyle.
She denied chest pain, fever, chills, dizziness, lightheadedness or syncope.
She remained afebrile in the ED but was found to have WBC of 17.
She underwent a CT head to rule out metastases, which was negative.
On transfer, patient was afebrile with HR- 77, BP- 112/49, RR- 16, SaO2- 98% on 15L NRB .
ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, weight change, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, chest pain, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, cough, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p MI [**2134**] s/p CABG [**2165**] Hypertension Dyslipidemia CVA: small left posterior frontal infarct in [**12/2164**] Macular Degeneration NSCLC- stage IV (oncology history below) .
-- [**12/2165**] presented in with unresolving right-sided pulmonary infiltrate and an unrelated myocardial infarction.
-- [**2166-1-2**] Sputumcytology confirmed adenocarcinoma with a pattern of stainpositivity consistent with lung origin (CK7 and TTF-1 positive).
She had stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer, based on the multiple intrapulmonary lesions.
She has no evidence of extrathoracic or central nervous system involvement with metastasis.
Her course was complicated by cytopenias and development of increased creatinine levels.
-- [**2166-5-23**] Chest CT showed partial response with interval improvement in the consolidation of the superior segment of the right lower lobe and nodular densities of the left lower lobe.
-- [**2166-8-13**] CT Chest shows increased density of right lower lobe consolidation and worsened peribronchiolar ground-glass opacities in the lingula are most consistent with worsening of widely disseminated non-small cell lung cancer, much less likely due to infection.
-- [**2166-10-2**] Chest CT: slight interval progression of known disease, no new sites.
Family History: Her father died due to CAD at age 52.
Her mother had stomach cancer and osteosarcoma.
No history of lung cancer, colon cancer or breast cancer.
Physical Exam: On Admission: Vitals: T: 96.9 BP: 118/51 HR: 94 RR: 18 O2Sat: 94% on 5L with face tent GEN: Well-appearing female in no acute distress HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, MMM, OP Clear NECK: No JVD, no cervical lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: Regular rate and rhythm, no M/G/R, normal S1 S2 PULM: Decreased breath sounds throughout.
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
Urine cx:   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2167-2-15**]):    NO GROWTH.
There continues to be progression of disease with increased extent of consolidative opacity within the right lung base.
Ill-defined opacities within the lingula and left lower lobe are similar to prior.
Small right pleural effusion is present.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Evidence of disease progression.
CT Head: [**2-13**] FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or recent infarction.
An area of encephalomalacia in the left frontal lobe, compatible with chronic infarct is unchanged.
Areas of periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity likely reflect sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
No concerning osseous lesion is seen.
There are calcifications of the bilateral carotid siphons.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process or mass effect .
LENIs: [**2-14**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
Interval worsening of diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities, bronchiolar nodules and dense consolidation within the lingula and right middle lobe.
After review of multiple recent prior chest x-rays and CTs, these findings can all be explained by worsening bronchioalveolar carcinoma, given the absence of any change rapid enough to suggest pneumonia.
Of course pneumonia might be present and unrecognized, and treatment should be made on the basis of clinical findings.
Moderate emphysema.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Brief Hospital Course: 82yo female with NSCLC stage IV presents with hypoxia.
On admission patient with chief complaints of progressive shortness of breath and non-productive cough.
No home oxygen requirement at baseline.
Admission CXR with no definite infiltrate, though concern for progression of her known lung disease.
In setting of elevated WBC.
concern for infectious process and empirically treated with levofloxacin and vancomycin in the ED.
CXR on [**2-15**] demonstrates new left lower lobe consolidation.
Additional hypoxia work-up notable for negative biomarkers, negative LENIs; unable to perform CTA due to chronic kidney disease and creatinine 2.8.
She was transferred to the medical floor on [**2-17**], where she demonstrated exertional hypoxia, usually asymptomatic.
# Post-obstructive pneumonia.
Consolidation of left lower lobe evident on [**2-15**] likely secondary to infection rather than progression of disease due to short time course of infiltrate development (although on CT scan of [**2167-2-16**], the radiologist concluded the opposite: that changes seen were likely caused by her NSCLC, though pneumonia could not be absolutely ruled out).
Outpatient oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is planning on continued surveillance with plan for possible further palliative systemic chemotherapy if symptomatic progression of her disease is noted.
CT scan for evaluation of disease progression was obtained and did show further progression.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] plans to weigh the risks and benefits of additional chemotherapy, as it will be complicated by her kidney dysfunction and other comorbidities.
#  CAD s/p MI.
Patient without chest pain; however, EKG with new ST-depressions.
Patient continued on home beta-blocker at a decreased dose due to relative hypotension.
# chronic systolic CHF (LVEF 30-35% by TTE [**12-25**]): Well-compensated.
As described below, lasix was held but B-blocker was given at a lower dose given relative hypotension and exertional tachycardia.
No signs of bleeding on exam.
Patient transfused 2units of pRBC due to history of CAD with appropriate elevation in hematocrit.
The patient's anemia is most likely secondary to acute inflammation in the setting of underlying chronic disease.

We communicated with your primary oncologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who will weigh the risks and benefits of additional chemotherapy, as it will be complicated by your kidney dysfunction and other medical problems.
Your congestive heart failure has been stable.
