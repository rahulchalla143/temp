His post operative course was complicated by pneumothorax after removal of surgical chest tube.
He became confused yesterday with headache and neurology consult service was consulted.
They saw the patient, suggested CT, CT was performed today and showed a single hemorrhagic lesion in the right frontal lobe with mass effect on the lateral ventricle, blood in the occipital horns, hydrocephalus.
Patient has been having fatigue and "imbalance" walking for the past 3-4 months.
Also c/o memory loss for recent things.
He was admitted on [**3-8**] for surgery, did well immediately post op but then yesterday (POD #4) began to have confusion, a "disinterest" in the people around him, acting "spacey", talking about the need to attend his father's funeral (who is long dead), having day/night confusion, aggitation at night (pulling at lines, etc.)

Melanoma stage IIB, originally diagnosed in [**7-26**] with left arm lesion, excised.
Had CT torso which showed pulm nodules [**9-27**], then repeat CT that showed enlarging pulmonary nodules [**12-29**], now s/p VATS for lung nodule on [**2193-3-8**].
Non contrast Head CT on [**8-26**] showed enlarged ventricles but no masses.

Gait: Retropulsion upon standing,  unable to further investigate due to unsteadiness.
Pertinent Results: CXR [**3-22**]:  Disappearance of left-sided apical pneumothorax with 9 days interval for comparison.
MRI post op [**3-22**]:Enhancement within the right frontal lobe tumor resection bed, in which the appearance is worrisome for residual tumor.
The record shows a low voltage but symmetric background rhythm predominately in drowsiness.
Occasional generalized delta frequency slowing that likely reflects drowsiness but may suggest dysfunction of deep, midline subcortical structures.
No epileptiform abnormalities were seen in this recording.
