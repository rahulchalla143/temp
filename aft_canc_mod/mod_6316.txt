Admission Date:  [**2144-9-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-12-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2085-7-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**] Chief Complaint: A fib with RVR  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right side thoracoscentesis on [**2144-10-28**]  History of Present Illness: 59yF with h/o mental retardation,  Nodular sclerosing Hodgkins Lymphoma s/p chemo, refractory paroxysmal a.fib w/RVR, ileus, pericardial effusion requiring window and pleural effusions, who p/w Afib w/ RVR after being discharged on [**2144-9-18**] to rehab following hospitalization for tachypnea and increased O2 requirement.
This past hospitalization was complicated by refractory afib with RVR requiring amiodarone ggt for conversion, GNR bacteremia with ecoli, enterobacter, and two species of klebsiella, recurring ileus necessitating rectal tube decompression, herpes simplex ulceration of the mouth and hypercarbia and somnolence requiring intubation.
Cardiac U/S showed pericardial fluid.
She was given Cipro and fluconazole in the ED, and then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for monitoring and further management of low BP and Afib/RVR.
An echo showed pericardial effusion with no evidence of tamponade.
She was found to have an elevated CRP and negative [**Doctor First Name **] and RF.
She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2144-6-22**] for evaluation of abdomenal distention in the setting of recent dx of pericardial effusion and iron def anemia.
CT on admission showed pericardial effusion with evidence of tamponade.
Pericardiocentesis on [**2144-6-24**] produced 510mL of serosanguinous fluid with predominantly lymphocytes, a few mesothelial cells and blood but no malignant cells.
CT torso ([**2144-7-6**]) showed diffuse lymphadenopathy, diffuse colonic thickening and incresing abdominal distention which was thought to be functional by both radiology and GI, and was relieved by rectal tube.
FNA biopsy of a left axillary lymph node on [**2144-6-30**] was non diagnostic.
on [**2144-7-16**] she represented to [**Location (un) 745**] [**Hospital 3678**] Hospital and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with hypoxia, pleural effusion and pericardial effusion.
Excisional LN biopsy of a L supraclavicular LN showed classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.
CTA chest was negative for PE but did reveal a mass compressing SVC.
Patient continued to be hypoxic to the 80's on 100% face mask and had persistent Afib w/RVR to 140s.
Her ICU course was complicated by paroxysmal Afib with RVR.
A thoracocentesis drained 1.6L of fluid which showed "many small lymphocytes and scattered reactive mesothelial cells."
- Xfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**7-25**] for AFib with RVR and hypotension with pulse 160s and SBP to 80s.
Her pulsus was recorded as 4 but she did have pulmonary congestion and distended neck veins.
- On [**2144-8-24**], cardiac surgery was urgently consulted following the echo that revealed significant pericardial effusion and right ventricular collapse.
She tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
She was maintained on Amiodarone and beta blockade for intermittent atrial fibrillation.

# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient initially presented with A fib with RVR and hypotension and thus was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] (please see [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] #1, below).
Unfortunately, she returned to atrial fibrillation with RVR.
She was not hemodynamically unstable, but her atrial fibrillation was quite difficult to control and her rate didn't decrease despite multiple doses of IV metoprolol.
At that time the treating team was unwilling to give IV calcium channel blockers as the patient had experienced profound hypotension when treated with them in the past.
After her return to the floor she continued to have long periods of atrial fibrillation of up to 7 hours at a time that was not responsive to IV beta blockers by push.
Patient was transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory distress that required intubation (please see [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] #2, below).
Patient had low blood pressures at that time.
There was no evidence of ventricular arrhythmia on telemetry.
#Neutropenic fever: The patient had a fever during her neutropenic period from her first cycle of ICE (axillary temp of 99.5 = oral temp of 100.4).
She also had a new left upper lobe infiltrate at this time and thus was initially started on cefepime, vanco for empiric treatment of neutropenic fever.
The cefepime was changed to Pipercillin/Tazobactam on the day after this over concern of sacral skin breakdown in the context of fecal incontinence over concern for fecal soiling and to gain greater anerobic coverage.
She was seen by pulmonary who raised concern for fungal infection over the appearance of the lung infiltrate but as patient remained afebrile her coverage was not broadened.
Coverage was discontinued after 10 days of no longer being neutropenic.
With concerns for possible septic picture patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage.
Her fevers resolved, and her antibiotics were discontinued when she was no longer neutropenic.
#Hypoxia: Patient had onset of hypoxia needing 2-4L of O2 by nasal cannula in order to maintain sats >92% during her second ICU stay.
CT chest was obtained and showed new left upper lobe infiltrate as well as large pleural effusions bilaterally.
Her pneumonia was treated (as above) but thoracentesis deferred as she was thrombocytopenic at that time.
As her hypoxia resolved with treatment of her probable pneumonia and was resolved by the time her thrombocytopenia resolved we did not pursue thoracentesis further.
Patient had repeated episode of hypoxia which resulted in repeat transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], felt to be due likely due to aspiration & mucus plugging in the setting of depressed mental status, coughing and emesis.
A component of pulmonary edema thought to contribute to respiratory compromise, so she was diuresed for several days.
Repeat chest xray showed persistent bilateral pleural effusions that were stable.
No intervention was performed.
# Lymphoma: NSHL as per pathology from supraclavicular LN biopsy.
Pt has also had pericardial tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis on [**2144-6-24**] and pericardial window on [**2143-7-25**] as above.
Twenty sessions of XRT to mediastinal mass was administered without complications.
# Ileus/abdominal distention: The patient has a long history of an ileus/abdominal distension (?s/p ileal and sigmoid resection) and this was a constant concern throughout her hospitalization, has large dilated loops on portable film.
Suspicion is for hirschprung-like syndrome but no official diagnosis is known.
# Urinary tract infection:  The patient had an indwelling catheter throughout her stay.
# Speech and swallow:  Because aspiration was thought to have contributed to her respiratory distress, she was initially given tube feeds after extubation.
# Access:  The patient had multiple PICCs and peripheral IVs placed for access, which she repeatedly pulled out.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course #1: On arrival to the ICU, pt was in acute respiratory distress with sats in 70s.
Sats came up to low 90s on the NRB but pt continued to have increased work of breathing, not moving air well bilaterally.
Her hypoxia was thought to be due to aspiration and mucus plugging in the setting of depressed mental status.
Concern for sepsis arose and she was given IV fluids and levophed for BP control.
She became neutropenic during this admission, which fell in line with her chemotherapy nadir.
The patient repeatedly went in and out of atrial fibrillation during this admission.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course #2 ([**Date range (1) 41899**]): Patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in acute respiratory distress again.
Patient with large pleural effusion which was tapped via thoracenetesis.
In addition, cardiology consult was obtained for persistent atrial fibrillation.
Diltiazem was uptitrated to 60 QID which patient tolerated well without incident.
In addition, WBC trended upward and as of [**10-30**] patient was no longer neutropenic.
Continued regimen for c. diff (with previous history of c. diff) with plan to keep c. diff treatment on for 14 days after last dose of other antibiotics.
