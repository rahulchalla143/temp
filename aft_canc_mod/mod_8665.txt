He reports symptoms have been rather persistent, possibly worse when lying down and with valsalva, with transient improvement from ibuprofen and nasal decongestant (containing phenylephrine), and similar to headaches he had in his 20s.
His daughter states over the past month he has had somewhat "hesitant" speech with occasional word-finding difficulties and has seemed slower with his speech.
He awoke this AM with a severe headache, but similar in quality to his recent pain and did not want to get out of bed.
He took 6 motrin tabs today due to his headache.
At 2 PM while trying to dress himself he kept falling backwards, but was able to brace himself and did not hit his head or get injured.
He denied any visual changes, dizziness, dysarthria, dysphagia, focal weakness, sensory changes, bowel or bladder changes.

Limited MRI study demonstrates T1 isointense lesion within the left parietal lobe which is compatible with hyperacute hematoma.
MRI demonstrates no vascular abnormalities in the anterior and posterior circulations.
CT (chest/abdomen/pelvis) PRELIMINARY READ 1) No definite evidence of new metastatic disease.
2) Upper pole right partial nephrectomy site appears hypoattenuating with small amt of fluid and perinephric stranding, without definite discrete mass.
3) S/P splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy with hyperdense curvilinear densities at resection site with small amount of fluid.
4) Liver hypodensities some subcentimeter and too small to fully characterize but unchanged since [**2123-8-12**], probable cysts.
6) Gallbladder stone/sludge.
8) Diffuse atherosclerotic disease and coronary arterial calcifications.
9) Foley in prostatic urethra.
He was noted to have confusion and word finding deficits.
Hypertension - patient initially required a nicardopine drip for systolic blood pressures ranging up to 220 systolic.
He was well-controlled, with a goal SBP < 180 due to his hemorrhagic stroke.
Intraparenchymal hemorrhage - the patient was found to have a left occipital subcortical hemorrhage on CT scan.
He was started on Keppra 500 mg PO BID for concern of seizure given the location of the bleed, however his EEG only showed diffuse slowing consistent w/ encephalopathy, but no seizure activity.
Thus, since the MRI could not be performed, we were not able to rule out that the patient had an amyloid angiopathy as a possible explanation of the small posterior cingulate gyrus bleed.
Other possible explanations include a hypertensive hemorrhage, a vascular malformation that bled or a hemorrhagic metastasis.
CTA rule out a major vascular malformation, although a cavernous hemangioma could not be ruled out.
Urinary Tract Infection - patient had pseudomonas growing in the urine and was initially started on IV Ceftriaxone, but switched to PO ciprofloxacin for a 10-day course to be finished on [**2124-1-17**].
5. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Left Occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage (hemorrhagic stroke) Urinary Tract Infection Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after an epsiode of dizziness and confusion.
On exam he was having some difficulty with word-finding, was unsteady when standing and was noted to be falling to the left.
Your CT showed evisence of a left subcortical occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
When you were transferred out we started you on new antihypertensive medications and increased some of your existing medications.
We also noted that you had a urinary tract growing pseudomonas and you were started on a medication (ciprofloxacin) for treatment.
The location of your stroke predisposes you to seizures and you were started on an antiepileptic (keppra), although your EEG showed no evidence of seizure activity.
