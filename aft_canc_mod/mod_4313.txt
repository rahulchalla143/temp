Admission Date:  [**2137-2-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-2-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2076-6-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**] Chief Complaint: SOB   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracenteses x2 Pleurex catheter placement  History of Present Illness: 60 y/o female with recently dx metastatic breast presents with fatige and SOB.
Sudden onset of SOB over 1.5 days prior to admission.
No F/C, no cough, no chest or abd pain.
She has not had further thoracentesis or paracentesis performed since discharge.
She was originally sent to [**Hospital3 **] where labs were collected and she was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] without intervention.
Her oxygen requirement increased to non-rebreather.
On exam she has decreased BL BS and dullness to purcussion.
CXR showed L > R pleural effision and possible RLL PNA.
EKG showed sinus tach and RBBB of unclear chronicity.
She had transient hypotension to 92/55.
ED talked with pt regaurding code status and confirmed that pt is DNR/DNI but that she would be ok with non-invasive ventilation.
She was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 **] from [**1-1**] to [**2137-1-18**] after presenting to on OSH with abd pain and a right adnexal mass with ascites.
Gastric bx confirmed dx of metastatic breast ca and she was started on paclitaxel.
She developed BL pleural effusions which required thoracentesis x 2 (lasat [**2137-1-15**] for 1200cc).
She was empiric treated for SBP at the OSH although para later in the [**Hospital1 **] course was not consistent with infection.
Past Medical History: - History of breast cancer.
While on tamoxifen in [**2127**], she developed a left-sided tumor and had a modified radical mastectomy with TRAM flap.
- [**12-14**] [**Hospital1 18**] hospitalization dx with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma on gastric bx consistent with met breast ca.
Presented with lichen planus, adenexal mass, malignant pleural effusion and evidence of bone mets consistent with stage 4. s/p Pacitaxil [**1-12**] and [**1-18**] - Hypothyroidism - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia .
Social History: Lives at home currently alone, previously with husband who recently had a stroke and is in a nursing facility.
No first degree relatives with breast, ovarian, colon, endometrial cancers.
Physical Exam: Admission: VS: Temp: 95.8 BP: 108/69 HR: 109 RR: 23 O2sat 92% on nonrebreather GEN: cachetic and drowsy but NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, pale conjuctiva, DMM, op with whitelesions, no jvd RESP: Anteriorly decreased BS at the bases.
CV: tachy,  S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g ABD: nd,  decreased b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly.
No significant ascites EXT: 2+ edema in BL UE and BL LE to knee, 2+ radials and DPs SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice/no splinters.
NEURO: drowsy but arousable to verbal stimulus.
Left Pleural Fluid for cell block; C11-3953A DIAGNOSIS: Left pleural fluid, cell block:   Positive for malignant cells, consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma.
A sessile 12 by 16 mm globular apical mass is seen in the left ventricle.
The mass enhances during Definity contrast infusion suggesting a vascularized tissue mass rather than thrombus.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
New subsegmental right and left lower lobe pulmonary arterial filling defect consistent with acute pulmonary embolism.
Interval decrease in size of left pleural effusion and new extensive left lower lobe consolidation.
Stable moderately large right pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis.
Apparent filling defect in the right internal jugular vein may represent thrombus or a flow artifact and could be further evalutaed with ultrasound, if clinically appropriate.
New left ventricular apical filling defect, most likely represents a thrombus as it was not present on the CTA of [**2137-1-2**] but a cardiac metastasis could also have this appearance.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2137-2-12**] IMPRESSION: Possible focus of abnormal enhancement identified in the right frontal lobe, involving the right straight gyrus, measuring approximately 2.8 x 3.3 mm in size, with no evidence of mass effect or shifting of the adjacent structures.
Given the clinical history, the possibility of a metastatic lesion is a strong consideration; however, dural enhancement or vascular enhancement cannot be completely ruled out, correlation with a dedicated MRI of the orbits and frontal lobe with high-resolution and gadolinium is recommended.
The left pleural effusion is decreased in size compared to prior.
The right effusion is slightly larger.
There is some residual volume loss/infiltrate in the left lower lobe.
Brief Hospital Course: 60 y/o female with metastatic breast cancer presents with hypoxia and fatigue.
Hypoxia / hypercarbia: She initially required a non-rebreather to keep her O2 sats >90%.
She had bilateral, recurrent malignant pleural effusions, likely leading to significant restrictive physiology and reduced ventilation.
A left pleurex catheter was placed on [**2-17**] without complications.
Low urine output:  This was likely [**2-6**] to low intravascular volume due to hypoalbuminemia and third spacing.
Her lasix was subsequently discontinued given the tachycardia, and may be restarted if O2 requirement worses.
She may not need continued diuresis with her new pleurx catheters.
Subsegmental PE: CTA showed a RLL subsegmental PE as well as a "LLL pulmonary arterial filling defect."
MRI brain showed a likely metastatic lesions, and she was therefore not anticoagulated.
She did not have any further respiratory compromise and not further treatment was initiated.
Metastatic breast cancer : Imaging cosistent with stage 4 disease with mets in adnexa, stomach, bone, and malignant effusion.
Her neutropenia, secondary to previous chemotherapy, was treated with good effect with Neupogen.
Echocardiogram showed a mass suggesting vascularized tissue in left ventricle (a likely metastasis).
Palliative care was consulted to help patient to better cope with her illness, address goals of care, and provide an effective pain regimen.
She is currently on both long-acting morphone and short-acting doses for breakthrough pain, but her pain has been very well controlled on the MSContin with minimal breakthrough requirements.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 **]Hospice House  Discharge Diagnosis: ## Widely metastatic breast cancer, with new evidence for probable intracranial and intracardiac metastatic foci ## Cachexia secondary to above ## Pulmonary emboli - right and left subsegmental branches, not on anticoagulation due to concerns re: brain metastases ## s/p recent neutropenic episode s/p Taxol therapy ## Febrile with neutropenia - no clear source of infection identified, treated empirically with vanco/cefepime ## diarrhea ## Hypothyroidism ## Hypertension ## Unstageable sacral ulcer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You also had shortness of breath.
You were found to have fluid around your lungs related to spread of breast cancer.
After a full discussion of your prognosis with your doctors, it was decided to continue to support you but avoid further chemotherapy as well as heroic measures and you asked to be discharged to hospice.
