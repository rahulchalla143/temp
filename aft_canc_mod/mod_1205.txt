Past Medical History: Hepatitis C complicated by cirrhosis and esophageal varices, now w likely hcc s/p RFA, Knee pain, Dysphoria, GERD, Erectile dysfunction, L thumb verrucae.
No smoking cigarrettes, but does have a cigar occasionally, quit ETOH (wine) 10 months ago, although no reported abuse.
Also of note there was initially congestion in the liver which was relieved with side-to-side caval cavostomy in the infrahepatic location for additional venous outflow.
The liver was pink with good arterial flow that was only pulsatile, and pulsatility in both the left and the replaced right hepatic artery.
Late on POD 1, another ultrasound was performed, and this time there was a marked change in the hepatic arteries, with diminished peak velocity and lack of diastolic flow in the main hepatic artery.
No right or left intrahepatic artery was identified despite diligent effort.
It was noted that there was evidence of a bile leak from a slit in the anterior wall of the bile duct anastomosis.
The GDA was religated and the side-to-side cavostomy from during his original procedure did not have evidence of outflow obstruction.
An extremely diminutive segment of the right hepatic artery branch is also seen, likely secondary to an extremely tight stenosis or alternatively the RHA flow may be from collateralization from the left hepatic artery.
The hepaticojejunostomy was patent with no evidence of leak, however, there was just a pulsatile flow within the hepatic artery, and the replaced right hepatic artery was obviously thrombosed.
The liver looked viable without evidence of necrosis.
There was some concern for elevated velocity in the main hepatic vein, and there was mild elevation in the LFTs, and bilirubin, however, without intervention, all values were down-trending daily and no further surgery was done.
The previously noted kinks in donor celiac artery less apparent and there was dimunitive but patent L hepatic artery, RHA is diminutive but patent and IVC and PV anastomosis are patent.
Liver biopsies collected during both post operative surgeries showed no evidence of rejection, and no necrosis.
