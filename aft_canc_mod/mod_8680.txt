In addition, he had a 5.0 x 4.8 x 5.7 cm mass centered within the right middle lobe adjacent to the right atrium and potentially invading into the extrapericardial fat.
Staging workup showed no evidence of metastatic disease, and he commenced a combination of radiation therapy with weekly paclitaxel (50 mg/m2) and carboplatin (AUC 2) on [**2123-4-29**].
During his last hospitalization, the patient was found to have leptomeningeal spread of his disease via lumbar puncture.

Subcentimeter enhancing lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere may represent a metastatic focus.
EEG [**2123-9-19**] This is an abnormal portable EEG due to frequent bursts of generalized delta frequency slowing in the setting of a slow and  disorganized background, consistent with a mild global encephalopathy.
This suggests bilateral subcortical or deep midline dysfunction.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, infections, and anoxia are among the common causes of encephalopathy.
There were no focal or epileptiform features, although encephalopathic patterns can sometimes obscure focal findings.
No electrographic seizures were noted.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSEMENT/PLAN: 66 yo man with NSCLC with mets to leptomeninges s/p WBXRT who presents with mental status changes and witnessed seizure in ED intubated for airway protection admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Found to have enterococcus UTI.
# Mental status changes: Pt found to be unresponsive at the nursing home, had seizure in the ED.
Neurology c/s: EEG mild global encephalopathy which could have been attributed to a variety of reasons including worsening brain involvement of NSCLC, infection, electrolyte disturbances, ischemia.
Initially started on vanc/ctx for possible meningitis however d/c'ed.
MRI head showed improvement in leptomeningeal enhancement however possible new met to L cerebellum.
# Seizures: Origninally ntubated for airway protection but extubated without complications on the day after admission.
Seizure was most likely due to leptomeningeal involvement of cancer with lowering of seizure threshold by UTI.
Head CT didnot reveal any interval changes.
#UTI: Found to have UTI with vanc and ampicillin sensitive enteroccous.
# NSCLC with mets to leptomeninges: Most recently whole brain XRT [**2123-8-31**].

# Electrolyte imbalance: Hypercalcemia & hypokalemia in the setting of dehydration and seizures.
# h/o SIADH: No acute issues.
