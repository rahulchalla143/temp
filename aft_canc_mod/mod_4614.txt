There is a new large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left temporal lobe, measuring 6.5 cm anteroposterior x 3.1 cm transverse with associated surrounding hypodensity.
There is new mass effect upon the entire left lateral ventricle with approximately 6 mm midline shift to the right.
There is effacement of the frontal and occipital horns of the left lateral ventricle.
Additional note is made of intraventricular blood products layering within the occipital horns, unchanged.
There is evidence of left uncal herniation and transfalcine herniation.

Interval development of a large left intraparenchymal hemorrhage with new mass effect, rightward midline shift, left uncal herniation, and tranfalcine herniation.
Interval increase in diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular extension.

You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.
-An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.
Loss of vision, either partial or total.
Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.
Severe sensitivity to light.
Severe headache or change in headache.
Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
New onset of seizure or change in seizure, or seizure from which you wake up confused.
Due to the complexity of neurosurgical procedures and treatment of neurosurgical problems, effective advice regarding emergency situations cannot be given over the telephone.
Should you have a situation which is not life-threatening, but you feel needs addressing before normal office hours or on the weekend, please present to the local emergency room, where the physician there will evaluate you and contact us if needed.
