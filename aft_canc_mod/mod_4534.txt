Microscopic dissection.
[**2174-4-18**] - INTERVENTIONAL PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Embolization of left middle meningeal artery with GDC 2 x 4 mm UltraSoft helical coil.
History of Present Illness: This is a 60 year old female who presents in consultationv for a R parietal parafalcine meningioma.
In summary, she underwent a revision of a Type I Chiari Malformation in [**2168**].
Within [**2-6**] days postoperatively she developed visual disturbances and 'light beams' to her L eye.
A Head CT revealed a R occipital meningioma.
She continues to have these visual disturbances, and occasional occipital headaches.
CTA from [**Month (only) 404**] shows a large right parietal parafalcine extra-axial lesion is most likely meningioma, measuring up to 4.8 cm.
This involves and causes non-opacification of a significant portion of the superior sagittal sinus.
There is also a smaller right frontal extra-axial lesion is likely second meningioma.
She denies mental status changes or memory loss, speech difficulty, nausea, vomiting, seizures, or motor/sensory deficits.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Postoperative changes with residual right parietal parafalcine extra-axial mass lesion invading into the adjacent superior sagittal sinus.
Small right frontal extra-axial lesion along the frontoparietal convexity represents a second meningioma and is stable.
Minimal post-surgical blood products and pneumocephalus.
No evidence of major vascular territorial infarction.
The patient underwent a cerebral angiogram with embolization of the middle meningeal artery without complication.
She underwent an MRI for post angio evaluation and preoperative planning.
Surgery was without complication and she returned to the ICU for observation.
