Susceptibility will be performed on P.aeruginosa and       S.aureus if sparse growth or greater..       WORKUP REQUESTED [**2123-8-16**] BY DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **] 3-8862.

FINDINGS: Upright frontal and lateral views of the chest show a moderately sized right pleural effusion.
There are postoperative changes within the right hemithorax suggestive of prior right upper lobe resection.
IMPRESSION: Moderate right pleural effusion as above.
Postop CXR [**2123-8-18**]  INDICATION: Assessment for fluid overload.
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing right pleural effusion has substantially increased.
Effusion now occupies most of the right hemithorax and leads to substantial atelectasis as well as to mediastinal displacement towards the left.
No focal parenchymal opacities in the ventilated lung areas.
There is new interstitial edema.
There is no evident pneumothorax.
There are no other interval changes.
Brief Hospital Course: 74M with significant medical history including DM, ESRD on HD, NSCLC s/p multiple radiation treatments, PVD s/p R CFA-AKpop bypass [**2122**], L [**Name (NI) 1793**] PTA/stent [**7-19**] presented with gangrene of the left first and second toes and chronic nonhealing left heel ulcer with a new foul odor.
Forefoot PVRs were performed showing that the metatarsal waveforms on the right are dampened but slightly improved compared to left.
Moderate flow deficit to both forefeet, more severe on the left than on the right.
The patient needed ongoing encouragement to keep lower extremities elevated and saturated his dressings from the open amputation site on multiple occurrenes, requiring reinforcement.
Throughout the early hospital stay he had multiple low fingersticks requiring amps of glucose.
Postoperatively he was extubated without difficulty although anesthesia noted an intraoperative episode of transient desaturation and hypotension which did not persist.
The patient did have a wet cough immediately in the PACU and was agitated.
A CXR was obtained to evaluate for fluid overload since the patient had received 900 cc of fluid intraoperatively in addition to missing his morning dialysis session.
The CXR showed white out of the right lung consistent with R lung collapse.
The patient has a known history of lung CA s/p radiation but this CXR was significantly different from his preoperative exam.
He was transferred from the PACU to the ICU for bedside HD and consideration of intubation and bronchoscopy with suspicion for a mucous plugging event being the culprit for these findings.
The patient did struggle with intermittent, unpredictable anxiety and stress, at times improved with family presence, other times exacerbated by family presence.

* If you notice any leaking of the vacuum dressing, apply tegaderm dressings as needed for reinforcement to promote further suction and prevent air leak.
* Change VAC dressing every 3 days and monitor wound for granulation, fibrinous exudate or purulence.
