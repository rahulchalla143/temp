She was recent admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with fatigue, found to have anemia thought secondary to disease of chronic inflammation.
She had been transferred to [**Hospital1 **] from OSH where had had gauic positive stool although non noted at [**Hospital1 18**].
Her fatigue was thought to be secondary to hypophysitis and her prednisone was increased to 10mg and she was discharged.
She notes that her fatigue has improved somewhat, she continues to have intermittent right lower abdominal pain likely secondary to metastatic disease, controlled with p.o morphine.
Over the last two days she has noticed worsening in her right lower quadrant pain.
Yesterday she had 3 episodes of loose stools, on the third one she noted some blood clots.
Today, she noted watery black stool with bright red blood and clots.
She denies feeling light headed, having abdominal pain at the time.
On arrival to the MICU, pt found to be normotensive, comfortable on room air with mild RLQ pain.

She was found not to have the specific BRAF mutation.
- [**2148-3-21**]:  started phase 1 RAF265 clinical trial with dose reduction x2 for nausea, vomiting and neuropathy.
- [**2149-2-5**]:  therapy held due to atrial flutter unrelated to study drug, requiring cardiac ablation on [**2149-2-11**].
- [**2149-12-1**]:  CT showed disease progression with peritracheal pleural-based and retroperitoneal metastatic foci with several new right pleural and diaphragmatic foci.
She received [**8-4**] doses on week 1, complicated by tachycardia and pulmonary edema.

She was recently admited for vague symptoms of nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain.
She was found to have inappropriate cortisol response and her home prednisone was uptitrated with resolution of symptoms.
During that admission it was found that she had a LLE DVT and was started on Lovenox.
CTA was performed and did not show active extravasation and that the IVC filter was still in proper position.
A colonscopy showed a non-bleeding mass in the ascending colon, likely metastasis.
Given that pt had an IVC filter and that she was perhaps to start on a biologic therapy trial (for which she cannot be on anticoagulation for inclusion) it was decided to hold anticoagulation.
ACTIVE ISSUES # GI bleed: Lower GI bleed more likely given [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], brisk UGI bleed less likely.
Bowel ischemia unlikely given lactate 1.4.
CTA was performed to look for active bleeding and showed no active extravasation and an IVC filter in proper position.
Lovenox started on previous admission for LLE DVT was held.
While in the unit, she was seen by the GI team who recommended preparation for colonoscopy to look for diverticular disease, AVMs, or any intervenable lesions.
Subsequent colonoscopy revealed a non-bleeding mass in the ascending colon.
# Thromboembolic disease:  Given her history of recurrent DVT/PE and recent catheter-associated IJ thrombus, she has been on enoxaparin prior to this admission.
Management of the balance of her bleeding and thromboembolic diease was discussed with pt and her family and it was decided that given her IVC filter and possible enrollment in a biologics trial for melanoma that did not accept patients on anticoagulation that she would go home without restarting Lovenox.
# Metastatic melanoma:  No active therapy at this time.
Struggling with fatigue felt to be secondary to hypophysitis from ipilimimab therapy, anemia, and her malignancy.
INACTIVE ISSUES # Diabetes mellitus:  On levemir and ISS at home.
Metoclopramide 10 mg PO QAC/HS PRN nausea 5.
Acetaminophen [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1999**] mg PO Q4H:PRN pain   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Non bleeding colonic mass   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were brought to the hospital after a bloody bowel movement.
You received a colonoscopy which revealed a colonic mass.
We had a extensive conversation regarding the risks and benefits of anticoagulation with Lovenox and you decided to stop it for now.
