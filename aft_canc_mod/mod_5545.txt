MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST Study Date of [**2125-7-11**] 6:29 AM MR HEAD WITH ANDWITHOUT CONTRAST:  This is a limited MR study intended only for pre-operative planning.
Mass seen in the right frontoparietal lobe is now 5.5 cm (AP) x 3.6 cm (TV) x 4.4 cm (CC) which represents a moderate increase (6 mm) in the craniocaudal dimension; the other dimensions of the mass are unchanged.
There is approximately 6-mm of leftward midline shift unchanged from previous study.
Vasogenic edema is seen around the lesion and is essentially unchanged.
Mass abuts and likely invades this portion of the sagittal sinus; though there is effacement, the sinus remains patent.
No hemorrhage, edema, infarct or new masses are seen.
IMPRESSIONS: Right frontoparietal extra-axial mass, likely parafalcine meningioma, effaces and likely invades the right lateral aspect of the mid-portion of the superior sagittal sinus, which remains patent.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2125-7-11**] 5:14 PM IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated postoperative appearance of right craniotomy with resection of right-sided meningioma.
Bifrontal moderate pneumocephalus with displacement of the frontal lobes posteriorly-close followup to excldue tension pneumocephalus.
Scattered air and tiny hemorrhage in the surgical bed but without large intracranial hemorrhage or intraventricular hemorrhagic extension.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2125-7-12**] 5:36 PM Shows post op changes and good resection of previously seen meningioma    Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted for elective right sided craniotomy for resection of mass.
