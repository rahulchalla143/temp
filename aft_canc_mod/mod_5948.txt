Admission Date:  [**2147-10-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2147-10-13**]   Service:  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 95660**] is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with a history of dementia, hypertension, CAD, CHF, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, who was brought to the Emergency Room for confusion where she was found to be hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 60s as well as hypoxic and complaining of severe abdominal pain.
Per her [**Age over 90 802**], over the past week, the patient had increasing confusion and had been unable to perform her ADLs which was unusual for her.
She had a CT of the torso showing a subcarinal mass and bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
She was also noted to have a large pleural effusion.
A right main stem pulmonary embolism was also noted, but not further characterized.
Coronary artery disease, status post non-Q wave MI.
Dry mucous membranes.
No rales or wheeze.
The heart rate and rhythm were regular with normal S1, S2, no murmur.
The abdomen was soft with marked right lower quadrant tenderness.
No guarding, no rebound.
Her extremities were cool and dry with no edema.
IMAGING ON ADMISSION:  Chest x-ray showing large left pleural effusion.
PE in right main pulmonary artery at first bifurcation.
Large left pleural effusion.
Diverticulosis versus diverticulitis.
No aortic aneurysm or dissection.
CT of the head:  Extensive brain atrophy, no bleed, no mass.
EKG showing normal sinus rhythm at 91, old Q wave in III, no acute ST changes.
Given her hypotension in the setting of likely sepsis, pulmonary embolism, and cardiac shock, compounded by the fact that she had what appeared to be newly diagnosed lung cancer on CT scan, her poor prognosis was conveyed to her health care proxy, her [**Name2 (NI) 802**], as well as her lawyer who is very involved in her care.
Cardiogenic shock.
Volume depletion.
Acute renal failure.
