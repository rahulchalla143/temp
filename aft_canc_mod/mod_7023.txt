Ms. [**Known lastname 104221**] recently completed a course of chemotherapy and XRT for a small cell lung cancer, which was in the right lung.
This was treated as a limited stage small cell lung cancer, with recognition that there were several other lesions bilaterally.
Most notably, there were bilateral apical nodules as well as multiple other smaller nodules noted both lungs.
She has some hot flashes on occasion, but denies any  fevers or chills.
She has an occasional dry cough, which is not productive of any purulent sputum or hemoptysis.
Past Medical History: Bladder cancer, status post partialcystectomy in [**2186**], orally treated diabetes, hypertension, bilateral lower extremity leg fractures with extensive reconstruction being done in the left ankle region, left breast cancer in [**2182**], status post lumpectomy and axillary lymph node dissection, status post radiation for this and tamoxifen for 7 years, status post right vocal cord in situ squamous cell carcinoma and intraepithelial squamous neoplasia resected in [**2194**] and [**2195**].
Family History:  No family history of bleeding dyscrasia  Physical Exam: Temperature 97.7, pulse 96, blood pressure 137/88, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 96% on room air, and weight is 169.1 pounds.
GENERAL: Well-nourished, well-developed woman, in no apparent distress.
No facial asymmetry.
No oropharynx or nasopharynx mucosal abnormalities.
There is no thyroid enlargement.
There is no tactile fremitus or egophony.
BACK: There is no spine or CVA tenderness.
HEART: Regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub, or gallop.
ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, and nondistended, without mass or hepatosplenomegaly.
There is evidence of multiple surgical repairs of her bilateral lower extremities.
Pertinent Results: [**2196-8-3**] 03:03PM   TYPE-ART O2-4 PO2-69* PCO2-57* PH-7.26* TOTAL CO2-27 BASE XS--2 INTUBATED-NOT INTUBA COMMENTS-NC [**2196-8-3**] 06:38PM   TYPE-ART TEMP-36.3 RATES-18/ O2-70 PO2-88 PCO2-58* PH-7.28* TOTAL CO2-28 BASE XS-0 INTUBATED-NOT INTUBA  PA and lateral upright chest radiograph compared to previous chest x-ray from [**2196-1-26**] and to chest CT from [**2196-6-28**].
The aorta is slightly elongated with no evidence of focal dilatation.
The right hilus is again demonstrated enlarged with additional perihilar interstitial density which is worse since the prior CT.
The bilateral small rounded opacities in the right upper and left upper lobe are again demonstrated.
The pleural surfaces are smooth with no pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION:  1) Enlarged right hilum with worsening surrounding ground glass and interstitial opacity.
2) Persistent bilateral nodular opacities.
CHEST: A left chest tube is present and a small apical pneumothorax is seen.
Opacification of the left upper lobe is present and also some opacities are seen in the right lower lobe.
These opacities could be due to pneumonic consolidation or aspiration pneumonia   INDICATION: Left upper lobe [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 406**] tube removed, evaluate for pneumothorax.
FINDINGS: Since the previous examination, the left-sided chest tube has been removed and no pneumothorax is identified.
There is decreased prominence of the left upper mediastinum since the previous examination.
Areas of consolidation within the left upper and right lower lobe are probably unchanged although appear less conspicuous due to marked increase in interstitial and air space opacity throughout the remainder of the lungs.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax following removal of chest tube.
Marked progression of interstitial and air space opacities bilaterally, superimposed upon pre-existing left upper and right lower lobe consolidations.
The findings could reflect pulmonary edema due to transfusion, drug toxicity, or less likely cardiogenic causes, or other etiologies such as diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage.
