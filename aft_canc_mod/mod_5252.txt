CLINICAL DATA: Heavy tobacco use with hemoptysis and RUL mass.
REPORT TO: DR. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Doctor Last Name **]  DIAGNOSIS: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Rare epithelial cells, lymphocytes and neutrophils.
[**9-20**] PET CT INTERPRETATION: There is focal abnormal uptake of FDG in a cavitary right apical mass with an SUVmax of 18.1.
There is abnormal FDG uptake in a right hilar node (SUVmax 8.8) and in the left enlarged adrenal (SUVmax of 4.21).
There is homogeneously increased FDG uptake in the left iliopsoas likely due to biomechanics.
Physiologic uptake is seen in the brain, heart and GI and GU tracts.
The CT shows vascular calcifications, a left renal cyst (not FDG-avid; 4.5 cm diameter), a small right non-FDG-avid cyst and osteophytosis at numerous spinal levels.
IMPRESSION: Findings are consistent with a right apical lung cancer metastatic to a right hilar lymph node and possibly to the left adrenal gland.
for metastatic lun INDICATION: Metastatic lung cancer.
FINDINGS: There is nodular thickening of both adrenal glands, more prominent on the right than on the left.
These both show marked drop of signal on the opposed-phased images, consistent with intravoxel fat.
Visualized portions of the liver, spleen, and pancreas appear unremarkable allowing for the technique.
Multiple renal cysts are present.
There is bibasilar atelectasis.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, left greater than right.
No suspicious adrenal lesions are seen.
for brain metastatic disease Contrast: MAGNEVIST CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with right upper lobe lung cancer for further evaluation.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images were obtained before gadolinium.
T1 sagittal, axial and coronal images were obtained following the administration of gadolinium.
FINDINGS: The ventricles and extra-axial spaces are slightly prominent but appropriate for patient's age.
There is no midline shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus identified.
There is no evidence of significant subcortical white matter ischemic disease or acute infarct seen.
Following gadolinium no evidence of abnormal parenchymal, vascular or meningeal enhancement identified.
Small retention cysts are seen in the left maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION: No enhancing intracranial lesions are identified or mass effect is seen.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2131-9-24**] 8:25 PM CHEST (PA & LAT) Reason: eval for consolidation.pna  HISTORY: Right upper lobe mass and elevated white count.
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral view compared to [**9-20**]:  Infiltration surrounding the cavitary lesion in the right lung apex has improved revealing the multi-cameral quality of the lesion and local pleural thickening.
Lung volumes are lower and there is interstitial abnormality at the right base exaggerated by overlying soft tissue.
This could be early pneumonia or, under the appropriate circumstances, drug reaction.
There is no pleural effusion.
On HD2, bronchoscopy showed scant bleeding from posterior segment of RUL; cytology sent and no malignant cells found.
On HD3 PET showed focal abnormal uptake of FDG in a cavitary right apical mass, abnormal FDG uptake in a right hilar node and in the left enlarged adrenal gland.
Patient then transferred to ICU because of 200c hemoptysis on the floor.
Patient had MRI of the head and abdomen which showed b/l adrenal hyperplasia, left greater than right.
No suspicious adrenal lesions are seen.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: right upper lobe lesion   Discharge Condition: good   Discharge Instructions: Call Dr.[**Name (NI) 1816**] office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 170**] or your own pulmonologist if you develop fever, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain.
