He presented for urgent revascularization given his unstable symptoms.
He was extubated on post operative night after Precedex was started for agitation.
He initially had low urine output with creatinine bumping 1.0 to 1.3 which resolved by post operative day 2.
He also had hyperglycemia with blood glucose in the high 200's post operative day 2 and 3 which improved with resuming home doses of Metformin and Lantus.
Ophthalmology was consulted post operative day 1 for the patient's complaints of bilateral floaters.
It was determined that there were no signs of hemorrhage or neovascularization bilaterally and it was thought that the floaters were likely debris from PPV prior laser.
The patient initially had a first degree AV block coming out of the operating room.
He was transferred to the step down unit on post operative day 4 after blood sugars were better controlled and he was in a rate controlled atrial fibrillation at this time.
His INR goal for atrial fibrillation was [**2-23**] and will be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further instructions for Coumadin dosing.
