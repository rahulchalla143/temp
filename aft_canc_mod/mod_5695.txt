Pt reported 2 episodes of emesis at home and had loose stools in the ED.
She was otherwise denying cough and chest pain .
Pt was noted to have decreased breath sounds at Right base but otherwise unremarkable exam.
Due to elevated LFTs, pt underwent RUQ which showed cholelithiasis but no signs of acute inflammation.
CXR showed RML opacity essentially unchanged from prior films.
Pt went to radiology for a CTA which showed bilateral PEs in the proximal LUL, LLL & RUL.
Pt was found unresponsive in pulseless polymorphic VT.  CPR was initiated for 1 minute, defibrillated and then became asystolic.
CT head was performed and revealed new hyperdense lesions suggestive of new mets, thus decision was made to avoid lysis.
Of note, EKGs post code were noted to have inferolateral ST depressions.
She was reporting nausea and had some brown emesis that was gastroccult positive.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC Hx: diagnosed with right breast cancer in [**2139**] for which she underwent lumpectomy with axillary dissection and radiation therapy followed by 5 years of tamoxifen.
She developed a local recurrence in 12/00, diagnosed by biopsy of a palpable mass in the right breast.
Due to a positive serratus muscle margin, a re-excision of the right chest wall was performed on [**2149-2-28**].
In [**10-27**], she was found to have extensive bony metastatic disease of the pelvis with additional involvement of the liver, pleura, and mediastinal lymph nodes.
She was treated with zoledronic acid and fulvestrant followed by 15 months of liposomal doxorubicin, after which she was noted to have a rise in her CEA and CA 27.29 tumor markers and increased bony pain.
Of note, however, her most recent CT scan of the torso, obtained on [**2155-6-18**], demonstrated multiple new liver lesions and enlargement of the prior hepatic metastasis, involvement of multiple new foci in the skeleton with multiple new lytic and sclerotic lesions, and multiple new pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal nodes.
Atherosclerotic coronary vascular disease - S/p CABG in ([**2137**]) w/ no episodes of CP since 3.
Hypertension 4.

Acute pulmonary emboli involving the proximal left upper lobe, left lower lobe, and right upper lobe.
No CT findings to suggest right ventricular strain.
Unchanged and likely metastatic mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, resulting in compression and atelectasis of portions of the right middle lobe and right lower lobe.
Intraluminal secretions and possibly soft tissue tumor invasion within the right- sided bronchi are again noted as described above.
New small right pleural effusion is present.
Slight interval progression in the degree of predominantly peripheral right-sided opacities.
While this may relate to progression of presumed lymphangitic disease (given interstital thickening), peripheral regions of infarction related to pulmonary embolism or superimposed infection are also in the differential diagnosis.
Unchanged diffuse osseous metastatic disease.
[**2157-1-31**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %) with inferior, infero-lateral and apical akinesis.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 82yo F with metastatic breast cancer on virorelbine since last winter, presenting with fevers and dyspnea, s/p polymorphic VT/PEA arrest in the setting of bilateral PEs.
MICU course: # s/p PEA arrest: Pt with metastatic breast cancer who p/w fever and found to have bilateral PEs, went into polymorphic VT/PEA arrest, coded (CPR for 7 minutes) and converted to sinus tach.
Most likely etiology for arrest was PE and cardiac strain.
of hemorrhagic mets on Head CT. .
# Acute PE/Resp failure: Pt presented with fever & found to have bilateral PEs, subsequently developed polymorphic VT/PEA arrest.
of hemorrhagic mets.
Pt did not have any respiratory distress on presentation.
UENIs and LENIs revealed R popliteal DVT.
# Fever: Etiology unclear, though may have been due to acute PEs.
Given recent chemo and neutropenia, pt received Cefepime and Vancomycin for presumed neutropenic fever.
On [**2157-2-1**] all antibiotics were stopped as the pt did not have a leukocytosis, was afebrile, did not have sputum and had an unremarkable CXR.
# Elevated LFTs: Pt was noted to have new transaminitis and worsening of obstructive pattern.
RUQ u/s was negative for acute cholecystitis.
This may be due to worsening liver mets, congestive hepatopathy and cardiac arrest.
# Metastatic breast cancer: Pt with known progression of her disease on capecitabine, currently on navelbine, although recent cycle was held for neutropenia.
CT head revealed dural-based metastatic disease.
# Prophylaxis - Heparin gtt, PPI, bowel regimen.
Triggered twice for acute SOB and tachycardia (HR > 150).
Etiology felt to be acute CHF decompensation, flash pulmonary edema and possible worsening of PE load.
[**2157-2-5**] overnight she had difficult breathing and had long runs of wide complex tacycardia to 150s.
