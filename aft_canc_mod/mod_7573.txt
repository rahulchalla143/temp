[**Known firstname 91899**] was initially diagnosed with his bile duct stricture in [**2183**].
He has had a number of stents placed in the bile duct and eventually these were removed.
He was doing well until he was seen at the [**Hospital 8**] Hospital by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2161**] and [**Last Name (STitle) 1834**] a CT scan, which demonstrated what appeared to be metastasis in the right lobe of the liver.
He notes that he has a glass of wine or beer a couple of times a week, approximately 10 cigarettes per day and he has quit approximately three years ago.
No drugs, no marijuana.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to       hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..     FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2186-5-24**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2186-5-27**]):    NO GROWTH.
Brief Hospital Course: On [**2186-3-24**], Mr. [**Known lastname 91900**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] right hepatic lobectomy and Whipple procedure for distal cholangiocarcinoma with metastasis to the right lobe of the liver.
He was intubated and sedated postoperatively for a prolonged period due to revision of pancreaticojejunostomy, drainage of right upper quadrant abscess and redo of pancreaticojejunostomy on [**4-8**] for pancreaticojejunostomy dehiscence.
CTA was performed on [**2186-3-27**] and was negative for pulmonary embolus, but did show a subdiaphragmatic fluid collection.
Octreotide was also started due to continued bleeding after initial OR on [**4-8**].
Cardiac echo was performed [**2186-4-10**] which revealed normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved regional and hyperdynamic global biventricular systolic function.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
He was taken back to the OR for concern of anastomotic leak from his pancreaticojejunostomy.
He continued to have a dropping hematocrit on [**4-14**] and  returned to to OR on [**4-14**] for abdominal washout, however no source of bleeding was determined.
Despite this the patient continued to have a transfusion requirement.
had a persistent transfusion requirement and returned again to the OR for abdominal washout later that day.
He again returned to the OR on [**4-14**] for abdominal washout.
Respiratory status subsequently improved and patient had decreased oxygen requirement.
Thoracentesis was again performed on [**5-16**] for large pleural effusion.
CXR demonstrated apical pneumothorax.
Reaccumulation of the pleural effusion occurred necessitating repeat thoracentesis with pigtail drain placement was done on [**5-21**] yielding one liter of exudate.
Culture of this fluid demonstrated 4+PMN, but was negative for microorganisms.
Notation of an 8-mm right upper lobe nodule was made and attention on followup scans for surveillance for metastasis was recommended.
CXR on [**5-29**] showed slightly decreased loculated right pleural effusion since the prior study still involving the major fissure and still with multiple air-fluid levels consistent with air loculations.
No pneumothorax was noted.
There was a small left pleural effusion.
He passed a bedside swallow and was subsequently advance to clears and then regular diet.
It was felt that prolonged and repeated intubations were likely the cause and that granulomatous changes would resolve over time.
Blood cultures returned on [**4-7**] positive for Prevotella species, but surveillance cultures remained negative since this blood culture.
On [**2186-4-20**] his PICC line was removed and his CVL was replaced for concern of rising leukocytosis to 14.
He continued to have anemia with stable hematocrit of 25.
He had been very debilitated, tachycardic and with O2 requirement.
