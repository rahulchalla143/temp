Nonspecific increased density in the retrotracheal region.
No free air.
After suctioning, a large food bolus could be seen blocking the esophagus at around 30cm.
Otherwise normal EGD to esophagus  Repeat Endoscopy [**2122-4-15**]: Normal mucosa in the stomach Normal mucosa in the duodenum Irregular z-line with tongues of salmon colored mucosa that may be consistent with Barrett's esophagus.
Possible small multiple rings were noted in the mid-esophagus.
Multiple other cratered ulcerations ranging in size from small 3mm ulcer to 1.5 cm ulcers were noted between 20-35 cm in the mid esophagus.
There was no active bleeding at this time.
Endoscopy was completed in the emergency room with visualized steak impaction, but was unsuccessfully disimpacted with air insuflation.

The interaction between pantoprazole and raltegravir was noted, but the PPI was continued due to need for acid suppression to prevent ulcer bleeding.
The risks of leaving including esophageal perforation, severe infection, bleeding and death were explained in detail with his understanding.
