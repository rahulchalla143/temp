No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
No evidence of free air is seen beneath the diaphragm although the patient is semi-erect in position.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
No evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms, however the patient is semi-erect in position.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or recent infarction.
Prominence of the ventricles and sulci reflects a mild degree of global atrophy.
No concerning osseous lesion is seen.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
There is reflux of contrast into the distal esophagus with distal esophageal wall thickening which may be related to hiatal hernia or esophagitis.
Within the abdomen, there is diffuse bowel wall thickening involving the entire colon with pericolonic fat stranding.
There is also circumferential wall thickening of the terminal ileum.
No focal fluid collection is identified though evaluation is somewhat limited due to lack of intravenous contrast.
The gallbladder is mildly distended and there is suggestion of mild prominence of the CBD (601B:20), though again evaluation is limited in the lack of intravenous contrast.
No free air or lymphadenopathy is identified.
No fluid collection, free air, or lymphadenopathy is identified.
There are atherosclerotic calcifications throughout the abdominal aorta extending to the iliac arteries.
No concerning osseous lesion is seen.
Diffuse colonic wall thickening with also thickening of the terminal ileum.
Given distribution and clinical findings, findings are consistent with infectious colitis, less likely inflammatory.
Prominent CBD, incompletely evaluated on this non-contrast examination.
Thickening of the distal esophageal wall may be related to small hiatal hernia, though esophagitis is a possibility.
[**2104-11-20**] MR Pelvis with & without contrast: Extensive inflammation is seen throughout the rectum and visualized portions of the sigmoid colon.
There is diffuse transmural wall thickening, mucosal enhancement and wall stratification after administration of intravenous contrast.
Perirectal edema and stranding extend out into the perirectal fascia.
No abscess or fistula is identified.
There is no free pelvic fluid.
No inguinal or pelvic adenopathy is present.
IMPRESSION: Diffuse sigmoid and rectal wall thickening consistent with known infectious colitis.
No abscess or fistula.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 30689**] is a 55 year old male with human immunodeficinecy virus (HIV) (CD4 224, viral load 277 [**1-/2104**]), Hepatitis C (VL 1,350,000 IU/mL [**11/2103**]), and gastric lymphoma that was diagnosed 8 years ago who presented with nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, episodes of bright red blood per rectum, and increased confusion; he was found to have Shigella enteritis with bacteremia, as well as acute kidney injury, hyponatremia, anion gap acidosis and transient hpoxia.
CT with evidence of colitis as well as thickening of the distal esophagus, and MR pelvis showed extensive inflammation of the colon.
Patient has documented history of being noncompliant with his medications and indeed his CD4 was down to 121 with an elevated viral load to about 4,000 copies.
His stool studies came back positive for Shigella flexneri.
Shigella enteritis could also account for the bloody stools.
Even as the patient's diarrhea improved, he still reported rectal pain, most likely secondary to high stool output and presence of Flexiseal for several days.
MRI pelvis confirmed absence of other rectal pathology, such as rectal abscess or fistula formation as a result of flexiseal presence.
# Shigella bacteremia: Blood cultures demonstrated Shigella in bloodstream, likely from translocation from GI tract.
His elevated white count and bandemia was consistent with systemic infection.
# GIB: BRBPR on presentation was most likely a consequence of Shigella enteritis.
This was accompanied by a drop in hematocrit that required blood transfusion while in the ICU.
# Altered mental status: Patient was reported to have been found with altered mental status by neighbors.
The patient had some emotional lability and tangentiality early on during this admission.
This was likely secondary to systemic infection, with some involvement of hyponatremia and possible underlying psychiatric disease.
# Acute kidney injury:  Baseline creat 0.9, on admission creat up to 2.4.
Most likely prerenal/hypovolemia related given profuse diarrhea and decreased PO intake.
Urine electrolytes and FENa consistent with prerenal etiology.
# Hyponatremia: Patient initially with sodium of 125, most likely hypovolemic hyponatremia secondary to diarrheal losses along with decreased PO intake.
Likely due to his septic shock.
LDH 169, which is not high enough to be consistent with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] CXR without convincing evidence of PCP.
The patient was not hypoxic, nor did he have any respiratory complaints or pathology for the duration of his hospital duration.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # HIV: High viral load and low CD4 count were demonstrated during this admission, most likely from poor adherence.
# Code: DNR/DNI confirmed  Medications on Admission: acyclovir 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] Diflunisal 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] Truvada 200-300 mg daily vicodin 5-500 mg 1-2 tablets q6h PRN pain (hip/foot) lorazepam 2 mg qhs PRN for sleep metoclopramide 10 mg TID prn nausea Viramune 400 mg daily Viagra Bactrim 800-160 daily triamcinolone chlorehexidine gluconate loratadine 10 mg daily   Discharge Medications: 1. acyclovir 400 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q12H (every 12 hours).
You were admitted to the hospital because you were having bloody diarrhea.
Your stool and blood cultures grew a bacteria that caused this illness.
