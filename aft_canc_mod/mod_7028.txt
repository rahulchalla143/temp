Swelling of the inferior aspect of the incision was noted on POD0, but the swelling and ecchymosis remained soft, warm and stable throughout her stay.
She denied symptoms of hypocalcemia, and her pain was well controlled once the patient was placed on her home dose of prednisone; the majority of her post-operative pain appeared to stem from her arthritis.
Mrs.[**Known lastname 4145**] had an episode of O2 desaturation down to 88% on POD2; this resolved quickly after humidified air and deep coughing produced a large mucus plug.
Of note, patient refused to be moved out of bed to chair day prior to discharge and also declined pneumatic boots for DVT prophylaxis.
