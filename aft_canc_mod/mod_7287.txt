Her ascitic fluid had a SAAG>1.1 and demonstrated no evidence of infection.
Her RUQ ultrasound demonstrated cholelithiasis, but no evidence of cholecystitis.
Hepatitis and autoimmune serologies were sent, given her mild elevation of LFTs (mainly a cholestatic picture).
There was suspicion that her ascites could be due to peritoneal or hepatic metastases from her breast CA, but cytology of ascitic fluid was negative for malignant cells.
She was also found to be hypothyroid with TSH 8.9 and T4 0.9, and was started on synthroid.
Liver service was consulted on [**4-2**] for ascites, mild cholestatic picture, and gallstones on U/S.
When entering the room to see patient, the liver fellow noted the patient to be unresponsive with vomitus on her chin, and SaO2 48%.
She was intubated with etomidate and succinylcholine, and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management of likely aspiration event.
Her abdomen became increasingly tense and distended.
Abdominal compartment syndrome was also considered.
A repeat RUQ U/S with doppler was done to r/o Budd Chiari, and found a patent portal vein with no hyperdynamic waveform to suggest CHF.
She had no pulse, heart sounds, or breath sounds for 2 minutes.
