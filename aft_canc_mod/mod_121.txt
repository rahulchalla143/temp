GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND CHAINS.
-[**Date range (1) 6098**] blood cxs are no growth to date  CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2177-4-14**] 9:47 AM IMPRESSION: Increased hazy opacity in the right lung, predominantly in the right greater than left base, which could represent asymmetric edema versus aspiration or infection.
No pneumothorax.
No laboratory data is available at the time of interpretation, which should be correlated as well as with clinical presentation.
HIP UNILAT MIN 2 VIEWS LEFT PORT Study Date of [**2177-4-14**] 10:13 AM  IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with posterior dislocation of the prosthetic femoral head from the acetabular cup.
Bilateral lower lobe consolidations, likely reflecting pneumonia and/or aspiration, worse on the right.
Right upper lobe and left apical ground-glass opacities, with neighboring smooth septal wall thickening, likely reflecting combination  of inflammation/infection and mild edema.
No pulmonary embolus detected to the subsegmental levels.
No acute dissection.
Mildly prominent left para-aortic lymph node/  Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2177-4-15**] at 9:53:07 AM Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area ~1.0cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2177-4-15**] 7:59 AM FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is marked improvement of the pre-existing right parenchymal opacity.
On the left, there is unchanged evidence of moderate retrocardiac atelectasis, potentially combined to a minimal left pleural effusion.
Unchanged status post CABG with stable size of the cardiac silhouette and stable sternal wires.
PELVIS AP [**4-15**] There is some relocation of the left total hip arthroplasty.
There is some asymmetric positioning of the femoral head suggestive of polyethylene liner wear with the femoral head positioned slightly more superolaterally within the center.
No periprosthetic fractures are seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 78M with hx of CAD s/p CABG, L THA with Left hip dislocation s/p reduction, here with hypoxia in setting of likely pneumonia/aspiration.
ACTIVE ISSUES .
#Aspiration Pneumonia with Strep Viridans Bacteremia.
Patient presented with dyspnea, elevated lactate, hypoxia, and CXR/CT with evidence of pneumonia vs aspiration pneumonitis.
He continued to improve clinically, remaining afebrile and without leukocytosis or an oxygen requirement.
One of 4 blood cultures was postive for gram positive cocci, so vancomycin was also started.
TEE could not be performed to rule out endocarditis due to his tenuous aortic valve but as patient appeared clinically well and had a very low-grade bacteremia (only one positive culture out of many bottles), CRP/ESR were low and TTE was negative for vegetations, there was a low suspicion for endocarditis so ID recommended he be treated for two weeks of IV antibiotics for his bacteremia until [**4-28**].
Cardiology was consulted who felt this was due to demand ischemia in the setting of his fall.
Patient was without chest pain throughout his stay.
EKG showed no acute changes only borderline ST depressions in I and aVL.
Patient remained chest pain free with stable EKGs throughout his stay.
Patient with total hip arthroplasty of left hip many years ago and has had multiple dislocations in past, this presentation is similar to his previous.
CHRONIC ISSUES .
#Aortic Stenosis: TTE on this admission showed severe AS (valve area 1.0cm2) with otherwise preserved EF.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - Given his severe aortic stenosis, patient will likely require cardiac evaluation to determine whether he is a candidate for hip surgery - Patient will need follow-up for his melanoma.
10. lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Solution Sig: One (1)  PO once a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Newbridge on the [**Doctor Last Name **] - [**Location (un) 1411**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY Hip dislocation Aspiration Pneumonia Demand ischemia .
SECONDARY HTN HL Aortic stenosis Coronary artery disease  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 6099**],   You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] because you fell, dislocated your hip, and were found to have trouble breathing.
You will need to talk to your cardiologist to determine whether you are a good candidate for surgery given your narrow aortic valve.
Your shortness of breath was thought to be due to some accidental swallowing of your stomach contents during your fall.
However, some bacteria was found in your blood, likely coming from this infection in your lungs.
As a result you will need to be on intravenous antibiotics to make sure that all the bacteria in your blood is gone.
For the lesions on your nose, we have arranged for the [**Hospital1 18**] dermatologists to see you next week to determine whether it is melanoma.
