Per report, he did not notice any abnormal movements, incontinence, or tongue biting.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she was admitted to the trauma ICU, where she was treated empirically for seizures with phenytoin.
She had a CT/CTA head, which was negative, and subsequent MRI showed a small area of [**Hospital1 **] but no major bleed.
Given the fact that the previous CTA was normal, it was deduced that the subarachnoid hemorrhage was traumatic rather than the cause of her collapse.
[**2-10**] patient without complaints, VS notable for SBP range: 160-197/90-100s, HRs: 90-100s, On [**2-11**] at approximately 5 am, when she became acutely dyspneic.
She was given Lasix 10 mg IV x1 and Morphine, and EKG showed new ST depressions in V4-V6.
Since this time, she has received 2 more doses of Lasix IV and was started on albuterol nebulizations for increased dyspnea.
Currently, the patient is short of breath and states that she feels like she is "drowning."
Otherwise, she has no new complaints.
She previously was employed making fuses, but has not worked since about the time when she was 40 years old   Family History: Her father died at a young age of a large ulcer and was an alcoholic.
Her mother died at the age of 86 of an MI and also had diabetes.
She has a brother who also has issues with low blood counts; family is not sure of the diagnosis.
Her brother also has diabetes  Physical Exam: On Admission to Cardiology Service: VS: T 99.0, BP 152/90, P 87, R 18, O2 97% on 3L GENERAL - Elderly woman, pleasant, using excessory muscles in obvious respiratory discomfort.

[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral stenosis.
The high mean gradient is likely due to mitral regurgitation.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Severe aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertensio .
MRI brain [**2199-2-9**]:  IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarct or enhancing brain lesion.
Subtle area of hyperintensity in the right posterior frontal sulcus, both on FLAIR and diffusion images likely represents a small area of subarachnoid blood related to recent trauma.
No evidence of acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage seen.
Brain atrophy noted  [**2199-2-8**]:  CT ANGIOGRAPHY HEAD:  CT angiography of the head demonstrates exuberant calcification and diffuse atherosclerotic disease involving the left distal vertebral artery in the V4 segment.
The basilar artery and the right distal vertebral artery appear patent.
In the anterior circulation mild irregularity of the vascular structures are seen in the anterior circulation due to atherosclerotic disease without high-grade stenosis.
CT angiography of the neck demonstrate diffuse atherosclerotic disease involving the left common carotid artery in the neck with irregularity of the arterial margin.
Bilateral widely patent and proximal internal carotid arteries are noted which could be related to previous surgery.
No evidence of high-grade stenosis in the neck.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates exuberant calcification and diffuse atherosclerotic disease involving the distal left vertebral artery.
Mild atherosclerotic disease seen in the anterior circulation involving middle cerebral arteries.
A small wedge-shaped opacity seen posteriorly in the left upper lung could be due to atelectasis, but clinical correlation recommended.
No evidence of fracture or malalignment.
Multilevel degenerative changes including moderate-to-severe central canal narrowing secondary to disc osteophyte complexes at C4-5 and C5-6.
Narrowing of the central spinal canal predisposes to spinal cord injury in the setting of trauma.
Sub-cm left thyroid nodule with adjacent calcification.
