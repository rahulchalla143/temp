The thoracic aorta is unremarkable with no evidence of acute aortic pathology.
The right ventricle is mildly enlarged which could relate to component of right heart failure.
There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.
There is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
There is bibasilar atelectasis.
There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
There are no focal consolidations concerning for pneumonia.
This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic foci.
There are multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine as manifested by marginal osteophytic formation.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
Mildly enlarged right ventricle which could relate to component of right heart failure.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2134-9-2**] at 10:50:10 AM   FINAL Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mildly dilated right ventricle with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2134-9-2**] 3:21 AM FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is almost unchanged evidence of moderate pulmonary edema.
No major pleural effusions but cardiomegaly and distention of pulmonary vessels as well as the presence of interstitial thickening.
Mild retrocardiac atelectasis but no evidence of pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 47 yo male with significant psychiatric of bipolar and schizophrenia with hx significant hx of severe complex sleep disordered breathing with severe nocturnal and daytime hypoxia who now presented with hypoxia.
# Hypoxia: pt with significant hx of severe complex sleep disordered breathing with severe nocturnal and daytime hypoxia related to hypoventiliation.
- BiPAP settings of 20/18 with 10L of O2 at night and when pt naps during the day - will need new home order for BIPAP - F/u with pulm/ sleep specialist  #Diastolic Heart Failure: Pt appeared fluid overloaded on presentation w/ elevated BNP.
He had an Echo on [**9-2**] which showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
Breathing comfortable with no signs of fluid over load.
-Continue on 80mg of lasix [**Hospital1 **] -continue metoprolol and aspirin 81  # Schizophrenia: Pt was very agitated, with pressure speech and very tangentional at presentation.
His increase in sleep due to better controlled hypoxia may also have contributed to his improving symtoms.
- continue carbamazepime, risperidone, and benztropine - He will need to have close monitoring and follow-up with psychiatry for titration of medications.
- EKG weekly while for QT prolongation until stabilized on psych med regimen  # DM II: as per notes most of his gluc has been in the low to mid 100s.
His last  A1C in our system is from [**2133**]  and is elevated to meeting criteria for DM 7.2.
Encouraged a diabetic diet and should f/u with his PCP for further management.
# Polycythemia: Hct lower than prior in the mid 40s%, pt had work up in the past by hemeonc, thought to be secondary polycythemia.
7. benztropine 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for dystonia.

You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for increase in shortness of breath and low oxygen levels.
You also were noted to have an arrhythmia which you have had in the past.
The electrophysiologists were consulted and recommended....  Psychiatry was involved in your care, and made changes to some of your medications to help with your bipolar disorder (as listed below).
The following changes were made to your medications: - STOPPED Aripiprazole - INCREASED Risperidone to 4mg by mouth two times a day - INCREASED Carbamazepine to 200mg by mouth four times a day - STARTED benztropine mesylate 0.5mg once a day as needed for abnormal muscle movements  Please take all medications as prescribed, and follow-up with psychiatry, cardiology, and your sleep [**Hospital1 21334**] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] from rehab.
