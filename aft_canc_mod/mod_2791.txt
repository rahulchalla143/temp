[**8-22**]: CT Head w/o contrast: Stable right temperoparietal intraparenchymal hematoma with slightly increased blood layering in lateral ventricles.
For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.
Consultations with ID are recommended for all blood cultures          positive for Staphylococcus aureus and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] species.

Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 53-year-old male w/ HIV ([**8-/2136**] VL undectable, CD4 226, toxo seronegative in [**Month (only) 958**]), HCV cirrhosis c/b ascites and recent diagnosis of brain masses that was a direct admission from clinic for evaluation of masses.
# Post MICU course: On [**2136-9-14**], he was transferred back to the [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name 679**] service.
On arrival to [**Hospital Ward Name 26179**], he had persistent left sided paralysis from his ICH.
His liver disease worsened and the combination of his ESLD, HIV complicated by PML, and ICH left his prognosis as very poor.
Ethics, Palliative Care, and Social Work were all involved and worked closely with the family on goals of care.
The bleeding was stabilized by replacing the foley.
# Brain masses/Intracranial Hemorrhage The patient was admitted for further work-up of his brain masses with the differential being PML vs. lymphoma given two negative LPs excluding other causes.
He was neurologically intact on the floor without any issues until early [**8-18**] AM when he had sudden onset L sided weakness, L facial droop sparing the forehead and dysphagia.
A CT identified a right temporoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
During this time, it was noted that the patient was able to follow commands with his right side, and withdraw to pain on the left.
At this time it was noted that although he could maintain his airway, he had no gag reflex and a weak cough.
The patient was continued on his keppra until [**8-30**], when he was changed to phenytoin for rising LFTs as discussed below.
# Altered Mental Status: On admission, the patient's mental status was at his baseline.
Post-intracranial hemorrhage, the patient was noted to have altered mental status.
Given his intracranial hemorrhage it was difficult to assess what portion of his altered mental status was a result of encephalopathy and what was his new baseline s/p intracranial hemorrhage.
However, around [**8-25**], the patient's mental status began to decline, despite a stable head CT, aggressive titration of his lactulose, and treatment of a concurrent UTI (see below).
He became drowsy and difficult to arouse.
No hepatobilliary obstructive process was observed on abdominal ultrasound.
His HCV level was 2,550,000 IU/mL, down from 5,220,000 IU/mL in [**4-/2136**], making HCV infection less likely.
#PNA and Sepsis: Beginning [**9-7**], the patient began to spike fevers to 101 with a WCC of 11.7.
A CXR demonstrated only minimally increased bibasilar opacities thought to be atelectasis.
Given his worsening respiratory distress, he was triggered and sent to the MICU.
He was found to have MSSA bacteremia and developed  # Urinary Tract Infection: On [**8-25**], the patient developed fevers to 101.
# Acute Renal Failure His renal function was impaired on admission with a rise in Cr from 1.2 to 1.9 with a subsequent decrease likely secondary to a pre-renal process given FeUREA.
# Thrush For the treatment of thrush, the patient was switched from clotrimazole to oral swabs with nystatin.
# Portal vein thrombosis The patient was admitted on anticoagulation for his portal vein thrombosis.
However, given the patient's intracranial hemorrhage during this hospital stay, his anticoagulation was discontinued and his INR was reversed with vitamin K.  #Hypertension The patient was started on metoprolol for improved blood pressure control in the setting of an intracranial bleed.
