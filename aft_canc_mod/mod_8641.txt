She had a significant headache and imbalance since [**6-30**] and an MRI scan of the brain showed the right temporal lobe lesion and a right occipital lobe mass.
She also had a chest x-ray which showed a right upper lobe mass.
At this point, her MRI scan of the brain shows a fairly large brain tumor located in the right temporal lobe which measures at least 4 cm with mass effect and right uncal herniation.
At this point, I have also started her on Keppra given the risk of seizures and as a preoperative adjunct therapy.

Her mother has a history of meningioma and uncle had a brain tumor.
Her palate elevation is symmetric.
PHYSICAL EXAM UPON DISCHARGE: non focal incision- sutures c/d/i   Pertinent Results: [**7-15**] MRI BRAIN: IMPRESSION:  Right temporal hyperintense mass and unchanged from prior study.
Small amount of intra- and extra-axial blood in the resection bed, without organized collection or significant mass effect.
Superimposed on the preexistent vasogenic edema, there is a rounded low-attenuation region, immediately deep to the resection cavity; while re-expansion of the subjacent temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is likely, a contribution of small post-operative infarct at this site is an additional consideration.
