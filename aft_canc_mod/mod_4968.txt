Admission Date:  [**2165-6-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2165-7-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2144-10-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: Status epilepticus, respiratory failure, pneumonia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Mechanical ventilation via ETT Central venous line placement PICC placement  History of Present Illness: 20 year old male with PMHx MVC rollover with traumatic brain injury in [**7-/2164**] complicated by increased ICPs (s/p hemicraniectomy), PEG placement, VP shunt, DVT/PEs (s/p IVC filter placement), pneumonia/bacteremia ([**1-/2165**]) with trach placement, difficult to control seizures who presents with status epilepticus in the setting of significant left sided pneumonia, mucus plugging and lobar collapse.
The patient was also significantly tachycardic (HR130s) with a low grade temperature (T100.5).
The patient received ambu-bagging en route to [**Hospital3 **] and received valium 10mg IV before presentation to the ED without resolution of his symptoms.
He received Tylenol 650mg NG, Ativan 6mg, Versed gtt with improvement but not resolution of symptoms (left eye deviation resolved); thus, the patient was also started on propofol gtt.
CXR showed LUL pneumonia and thus the patient also received nebs, zofran 4mg IV and Cefepime 400mg /Cipro ??
Prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for continuity of care and further work-up of acute critical illness, the patient received Decadron 10mg IV (unclear rationale), Fentanyl 100mg IV and Vecuronium 8mg IV X3 for irregular respirations.
CXR showed complete white out of left hemithorax with air bronchograms and concern for Auto-PEEP.
The patient's labs were notable for Lactate 4.2, leukocytosis to 15.6 with bandemia, troponin T 0.06 and low dilantin (7.0, target 13-20) and phenobarbital levels (10.5, target 20).
EKG showed sinus tachycardia.
RUE tremors/ twitching no longer present.
Per patient's mother, increased coughing and decreased interactiveness since Monday although there had been discussions then regarding discontinuing trach.
Past Medical History: No medical issues until [**7-/2164**] when MVC with roll-over occurred * Right subdural hematoma with midline shift requiring emergent hemicraniectomy for increased ICPs ([**7-/2164**]) * Multiple brain contusions/skull fractures ([**7-/2164**]) * Traumatic brain injury ([**7-/2164**]) * L1 burst fracture ([**7-/2164**]) * s/p PEG, NPO with G-tube feeds only * s/p VP shunt and craniotomy ([**9-/2164**]) * s/p Trach, now decannulated ([**1-/2165**]) * s/p IVC filter placement for DVTs --> acute segmental/subsegmental pulmonary emboli involving basal right lower lobe pulmonary arteries (Right upper lobe, apical segments) ([**1-/2165**]) * Tachycardia felt due to autonomic instability from his injuries * Pneumonia/bacteremia (BCx coag neg staph, BAL pseudomonas/coag pos staph) s/p Vancomycin and Cefatazidime X14day courses   Social History: Has been at [**Hospital 7740**] Rehab since clinical improvement at [**Hospital3 **] in [**Hospital1 3597**].
Mother was recently on vacation when current episode occurred, endorses recent concerns regarding cough that was not addressed at [**Location (un) 7740**].
Family History: Mother with multiple sclerosis.

He has occasional twitches of his R shoulder and R arm but these are well controlled when Dilantin and Phenobarbital levels are normal.
No purposeful movements.
Arm and legs are in decerebrate position  Pertinent Results: [**6-23**] cxr FINDINGS: There is near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax with associated loss of volume and hyperinflation of the right lung, compatible with complete left upper lobe collapse and partial left lower lobe collapse.
The hyperinflated right lung is clear with no focal consolidations.
There are no pleural effusions and no evidence of pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Complete left upper lobe and near complete left lower lobe collapse with associated mediastinal shift and right lung hyperinflation.
[**6-23**] ct head  IMPRESSION: Increased conspicuity of high-attenuation material layering along the tentorium concerning for increased subdural hemorrhage.
Otherwise unchanged appearance of the brain with extensive encephalomalacic change, some areas of subdural hemorrhage, most prominent along the right cerebellar hemisphere and ventriculomegaly status post ventriculostomy catheter placement.
Near cut off of the left main stem bronchus which may be due to mucous plugging/obstructing lesion for which recommend correlation with direct visualization/bronchoscopy.
Right lower lobe atelectasis.
VP shunt from a left frontal approach without evidence of disruption or sharp kinking along its course.
Near complete opacification of the left hemithorax with associated leftward mediastinal shift consistent with lung collapse.
[**6-24**] eeg  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG due to the presence of a slow background which represents a moderate encephalopathy.
Also abnormal was decreased amplitude and decreased faster activity in the left hemisphere demonstrating widespread left hemisphere cortical and  subcortical dysfunction.
Additionally, there were frequent periods of generalized delta frequency slowing which represents deep midline dysfunction.
There were infrequent left centro-parieto-occipital sharp waves, indicative of an area of cortical irritability.
There were many pushbutton activations, some of which were for eyelid fluttering which did not correlate with any evidence of electrographic seizures.
There were no clear electrographic seizures during this recording.
[**6-25**] eeg  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal 24-hour video EEG telemetry which captured two pushbutton activations for eyelid fluttering and was also associated with right arm tremor which had no electrographic evidence of seizure activity.
Interictally, rare low amplitude spike and wave discharges were seen over the left centro-parieto-occipital region.
Additionally, the beginning of record showed lower voltage and slower activity over the left hemisphere which indicates subcortical dysfunction, was less prominent over the second half of the recording.
[**6-26**]/eeg  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to the presence of occasional left frontocentral epileptiform discharges phase reversing at F3 and isoelectric at F3/C3 indicative of an area of epileptogenic cortex.
No clear electrographic seizures were seen.
There was a pushbutton activation for right shoulder jerking and head jerking which had no electrographic correlate.
Otherwise, the background was slow and disorganized, indicative of a moderate encephalopathy.
[**7-1**] cxr IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**6-25**] through [**6-29**]: Left lower lobe consolidation accompanying small left pleural effusion continue to clear.
No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course: 20 year old male with PMHx MVC rollover with traumatic brain injury in [**7-/2164**] complicated by increased ICPs (s/p hemicraniectomy), PEG placement, VP shunt, DVT/PEs (s/p IVC filter placement), pneumonia/bacteremia ([**1-/2165**]) with trach placement, difficult to control seizures who presents with status epilepticus in the setting of significant left sided pneumonia, mucus plugging and lobar collapse.
Hypoxia: The patient was profoundly hypoxic and intermittently difficult to ventilate with CXR and CT chest concerning for a significant pneumonia in his left lung on admission.
Lactate, leukocytosis with bandemia, relative hypotension suggestive of pneumonia with early sepsis picture likely causing his hypoxia.
He underwent flexible bronchoscopy on the day after admission and purulent secretions were suctioned and sent for culture which eventually grew out 2 strains of Pseudomonas as above (1 of which was extensively resistant) and 1 strain of Proteus.
Sputum cultures were repeated and showed continued growth of the resistant pseudomonas with no resistance to Meropenem.
They continuous EEG monitoring showed the jerking movements were not related to seizure activity.
# Hypotension: Originally on admission in setting of antiepileptics and Propofol, but responded quickly to fluids and pressors never needed, no further issue.
# Ossified Mass: When Mr. [**Known lastname 4882**] received a CT scan of his chest, abdomen, pelvis to evaluate for a lung abscess based on his new fevers prior to initiation of Colistin an ossified mass was noted in his hip.
# Subdural hematoma: Known right subdural hematoma after MVC with emergent hemicraniectomy at the time.
CT head concerning for worsening subdural hematoma given presentation of status epilepticus; however NSurg felt that the small amt of bleeding was not clinically significant and unlikely to cause these symptoms.
# VP shunt: Placed in [**9-/2164**] with no known complications.
VP shunt was tapped by Neurosurgery and was completely normal, no signs of infection.
# Pulmonary emboli/DVT: DVTs in Fall [**2164**] s/p IVC filter and still developed segmental/subsegmental right sided pulmonary emboli, which were diagnosed in [**2165-1-19**].
# Tachycardia: At baseline, felt due to autonomic dysfunction from his traumatic brain injury.
