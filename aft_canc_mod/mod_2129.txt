He was admitted for dyspnea/tachypnea/epigastric pain, and found to have a Coag negative Staph in his pleural fluid and Urine and treated with levofloxacin.
Also found to have tachypnea at that time that was thought to be [**3-9**] anxiety where morphine and ativan relieved his symptoms.
He is also complaining of right sided upper flank/RUQ pain since yesterday ([**11-8**]) that is crampy, [**11-14**], and worsens with movement.
Yesterday, he also felt short of breath where he felt he could not catch his breath and was breathing fast while he was taking a shower.
Reportedly placed on a [**Last Name (LF) 597**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] signout but no documentation in chart.
CT Torso was done that showed a stable pleural effusion that was not drained.
Concern for PE, but patient not a canidate for CTA because of creatinine of 1.5, V/Q wouldn't work due to malignancy.
Abdominal/rt flank pain had decreased to a [**2162-7-12**] and was complaining of thirst.
Past Medical History: [**7-/2159**]: Diagnosed with non small cell lung cancer by CT guided biopsy [**2159-9-20**]: PET scan with low-attenuation lesion in the left lobe of the thyroid gland measuring 25 x 7 mm in addition to markedly FDG avid left upper lobe mass consistent with known cancer and FDG avid prominent bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy suspicious for metastatic disease, but no pathologically enlarged infraclavicular lymph nodes.
He also had retroperitoneal internal and external iliac chain FDG avid lymphadenopathy considered unusual for lung carcinoma.
[**2159-10-31**]: Left axillary lymph node dissection.
With pathology revealing florid reactive follicular hyperplasia consistent with HIV associated lymphadenopathy.
Other than the visit with his infectious disease on [**2160-5-5**], he then lost to follow up until [**7-13**].
[**2160-7-24**]: CT demonstrated left upper lobe mass minimally increased in size from [**3-/2160**] with a sub 5 mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule with additional stable bilateral nodules, new left-sided pleural effusion.
Pathology revealed 4R lymph nodes with no malignancy but frozen sections showed metastatic large cell carcinoma and 4L lymph nodes that showed metastatic large cell carcinoma.
A level 7 lymph node showed metastatic large cell carcinoma and a parietal pleural biopsy also showed metastatic large cell carcinoma involving the pleura.

Largely stable moderate left pleural effusion, containing pleural catheter located along the periphery of the effusion, unchanged from prior.
No significant change in left upper lobe mass.
Innumerable bony metastatic lesions, without evidence of pathological fracture at this time.
No superimposed acute abnormalities in the chest, abdomen or pelvis, given non-contrast examination.. .
Interval development of numerous supratentorial, infratentorial, and  brainstem enhancing lesions, some of them which are in the periphery [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction and others which appear to invade/arise from the leptomeningeal space consistent with new intracranial metastatic disease.
Questionable focus of enhancement within the right posterolateral aspect of the cervical spinal cord at the level of C1/C2 measuring 3.3 mm seen on the coronal images (series 1000, image 76).
Stable sellar mass, likely representing a macroadenoma .
Extensive osseous metastatic lesions in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine as well as in the iliac bones and sacrum.
Within these limitations no gross epidural mass noted.
No abnormal  enhancement noted in the cord.
Multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar  spine, with moderate spinal canal stenosis and possible deformity of the  ventral cord, as seen on the sagittal sequences do not convincingly conformed on the axial sequences; moderate spinal canal stenosis at L4-5 and L5-S1 levels from disc, facet and ligamentum changes resulting in compression on the roots of the cauda equina better seen on the sagittal than on the axial.
CXR: Slight decrease in left pleural effusion compared to the prior study.

# Nausea/vomiting RUQ Pain:  Patient had a significant workup in prior admissions with EGD showing gastritis and a RUQ ultrasound was negative.
CT abdomen also negative for acute process.
An MRI head showed metastatic disease of his large cell lung cancer, and this was thought to be the etiology of his nausea and vomiting.
He also received 9 of 10 cycles of palliative whole brain radiation therapy.
# Dyspnea: Initially patient's RR was in the 40s, with oxygen saturations in the high 90s.
It was felt that his tachypnea was due to the significant back/right upper quadrant pain, his persistent vomiting which may have strained some of his muscles, and a large degree of anxiety.
There was a low suspicion for thromboembolic disease.
HAART stopped for renal/liver failure during last admission.
[**Last Name (STitle) 7443**], because of the patient's borderline renal insufficiency and his PPI therapy.
# ANXIETY: Stable.
# Hypertension: Normotensive.

Discharge Condition: stable and improved, nausea resolved   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath and persistent nausea and vomiting.
Your shortness of breath was thought to be due to anxiety and improved with medications.
You had an MRI of your head that showed your lung cancer had likely spread to your brain, and this was likely causing the nausea and vomiting.
Your nausea and vomiting improved with the radiation and steroids.
You required insulin to control elevated blood sugars which were most likely due to the steroids.
Please call your physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 911 if you develop fevers/chills, worsening nausea/vomiting or abdominal pain, shortness of breath, lightheadednes or dizziness, chest pain, or any other concerning medical symptoms.
