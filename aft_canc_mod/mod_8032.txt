Admission Date:  [**2159-4-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2159-4-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2108-8-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Percocet  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4616**] Chief Complaint: fever, hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 50 year-old woman with a history of non-small cell lung cancer with recent meningitic spread, s/p recent XRT, with lower extremity weakness, who presents with a sacral ulcer and abdominal pain.
She was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2159-2-22**] when she presented with increasing lower extremity weakness.
There she has been mostly bed-bound but being moved back and forth to wheelchair most days.
She was aware that she had a sacral ulcer and believes that bandages were being changed regularly.
She has mild pain at that site that has not changed recently.
For the past two weeks she has also had constant [**7-2**] abdominal pain that she calls her "gas pain".
She has had some associated nausea without vomitting.
No blood in bowel movements.
She did not have fevers or chills until the day prior to admission when she noted chills.
No fever was recorded.
She had a CT of her torso that demonstrated air adjacent to a sacral decubitus ulcer.
Review was negative for chest pain or palpiations.
No pain around her indwelling catheter.
Positive for ongoing lower extremity weakness that has been slowly worsening since her discharge.
Positive also for diplopia with rightward gaze.
No numbness or tingling.
Past Medical History:  Past Medical History: -anxiety/panic attacks -lung cancer as below (per recent note of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]: .
On [**2151-12-8**], right upper lobectomy revealed stage I, 1.1 cm poorly differentiated large cell carcinoma with negative bronchial and vascular margins, no pleural or vascular involvement, and no involved lymph nodes.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] did well until [**2153**] when she developed worsening dyspnea.
PET scan was negative, but she underwent a left VATS/wedge resection which demonstrated a 0.6 cm poorly differentiated large cell carcinoma.
In [**2156**], she developed left-sided chest wall discomfort and swelling at the site of her previous wedge resection.
U/S of the swelling showed a heterogeneous soft tissue mass.
Biopsy of this lesion on [**2157-7-12**] revealed metastatic poorly differentiated NSCLC.
PET scan [**2157-8-3**] was notable for an FDG avid left chest wall mass, SUV 16.4, consistent with recurrent disease.
There was also a single left 8mm axillary node with an SUV of 2.7.
The mass was a 4 x 4 cm poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, histologically similar to her previous tumor, and involving the chest wall.
There were multiple nodules seen and the superior nodule was noted to be metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma on pathology.
All margins were negative, but there was concern for lymphangitic spread.
In [**3-/2158**], she developed pain in the left axilla and left chest wall.
CT chest on[**2158-4-20**] showed an enlarged left axillary lymph node and increase in the soft tissue component of the left chest wall lesion in the area of her prior surgery.
Biopsy of the lymph node was consistent with NSCLC.
PET on [**2158-5-15**] showed interval development of an FDG avid, enlarged soft tissue mass in the left axilla, abutting the chest wall, with adjacent FDG avid adenopathy.
There was also increased avidity in the region of the left lateral sixth rib at the site of the prior resection, concerning for recurrent disease.
She completed 3 cycles of treatment but it was held on [**2158-7-27**] due to grade [**12-26**] side effects of fatigue, leg cramps, neuropathy, pain and weight loss.
Her PET scan on [**2158-9-14**] showed disease progression.
CT [**2158-12-4**] showed increase in her left axillary lymph node.
In [**1-/2159**], she presented with lower extremity weakness and diplopia with rightward vision.
MRI was suggestive of leptomeningeal spread of her lung cancer, confirmed by LP.
Social History: The patient lived in [**Location 686**] with her husband until her recent admission for weakness since when she has been residing at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
She has no children of her own, but four stepchildren who visit often.
Family History: No family history of lung cancer or other malignancy.

CXR [**4-2**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2158-10-11**], there is little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
Post-surgical changes at the lung base and apparent fibrotic streak in the left mid zone are both less prominent.
Old healed rib fracture on the right is again seen.
CXR [**4-9**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-2**], there is little change and no evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
Post-surgical changes are again seen at the left base and there is evidence of old healed rib fractures on the right.
New large right sacral subcutaneous gas tracking anteriorly along the puborectalis muscle, this finding needs to be clinically correlated.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Left axillary nodule, left paratracheal nodule, and left paraspinal lesion are all similar in size.
Multiple pulmonary nodules are redemonstrated, though some appear new.
Striated left renal nephrogram, which may indicate pyelonephritis in the appropriate clinical context, recommend comparison with urinalysis.
Brief Hospital Course: A 50-year-old woman with metastatic lung cancer and lower extremity weakness secondary to leptomeningeal spread presents with hypotension, hypothermia.
# Hypotension and hypothermia: Most likely secondary to sepsis.
She was responsive to fluid boluses, with MAP >65 and did not require CVP monitoring or pressors.
She had one episode of hypotension with mild lightheadedness on the floor with SBP 80s which repsonded to 1L fluid bolus.
We continued to hold her lisinopril given persistent low BPs  # Urinary tract infection: Most likely source of septic picture.
However, given recent hospitalization and long-term care facility wtih indwelling catheter, she is also at risk for resistant micro-organisms.
Antibiotics were changed to levofloxacin and she remianed afebrile and hemodynamically stable on levofloxacin alone.
# Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: Contributing factors including prolonged immobilization with lower extremity paresis, recent XRT, and recent steroid use.
There was initially concern for necrotizing fasciitis given air tracking along puborectalis on CT abdomen.
Wound does appear to have an infectious component, and would be concern for resistant bacteria given recent hospitalization and LTC facility but cx were all no growth so vanco was discontinued.
# Abdominal pain: Chronicity was difficult to tease out, but most likely cause is pyelonephritis.
Possible contribution from constipation.
CT abdomen did not show any acute intra-abdominal process.
She was given a bowel regimen and pain was managed aggressively once blood pressure recovered.
Likely contribution from bone marrow suppression secondary to recent XRT and widespread cancer.
Concern for bleeding, although no evidence of such on CT torso.
Hemolysis unlikely given normal Tbili and elevated hapto.
Repeat hemolysis labs showed no evidence of hemolysis.
# LUE swelling: Pt noted to have mild LUE edema on exam.
# Chest tightness: Pt c/o chest wall tightness intermittently which was constant and worse with movement.
She has focal chest wall tenderness left chest wall/rib cage where lidocaine patch is and where she has ahd pain in the past.
Felt unlikely to be cardiac since reproducible on exam and ECG without acute changes.
Continued lidoderm patch and she had no further complaints.
# Metastatic NSCLC c/b near paralysis and multifocal pain: Patient currently with good pain control now back on home regimen and with MS contin increased to TID dosing.
Continued PO dilaudid for breakthrough pain.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) Puff Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for SOB or wheeze.
Ativan 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as needed for anxiety.
