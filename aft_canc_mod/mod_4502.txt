MODERATE GROWTH.
HD1: Nutrition status was addressed and PICC line was placed and TPN started for severe malnutrition.
Imagies from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital were obtained for evaluation of gastric tumor.
HD6: Abdomen rx: Large amount of residual food in the stomach is consistent with gastric outlet obstruction.
HD 7: Family meeting for discussion of pathology and prognostic and surgical options.
The express their which to [**Hospital 10836**] with tumor resection with understanding of risk and benefits.
HD 8: Preop evaluation CXR: The heart remains within normal limits in  size and there is no evidence of vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute pneumonia.
Findings: There was a very large tumor of the mid body of the stomach which extended downwards fairly close to the pylorus.
There was a fair amount of bulky nodal disease at the base of the right gastroepiploic system as well as working its way down onto the middle colic vessels.
There was evidence of lymphatic tumor in the stomach itself.
The stomach itself seemed to be reasonable proximally, however, there were some lymph nodes in the left gastric distribution as well as the right gastric as well.
There was no evidence of metastatic disease to the liver.
There may have been some small tumor nodules on the area of the omentum close to the tumor itself.
HD 13 POD4: ([**2123-5-10**]) Ex lap He initially did well, but early in the morning developed a fever associated with some more abdominal pain.
However, given the clinical situation, that even if the CT scan did not show a definitive problem in the abdomen this needed to be ruled out as one could not be sure that there was not an occult perforation, especially of the colon.
Findings: There was a mild to moderate amount of clear fluid in the abdomen which appeared to be postoperative.
There was no turbidity to the fluid, and there was certainly no evidence of enteric contents.
There was no fibrin on essentially any of the surfaces of the bowel indicating infection or severe inflammation.
There was 1 suture on the anterior portion of the colon anastomosis which was more visible than others, but there was no evidence of perforation at this point and no discoloration.
The pancreas itself had several small areas of saponification consistent with dissection around that area, but there was no evidence of leak around this area.
Bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right than the left.
No intrahepatic bile duct dilatation or common bile duct dilatation.
If clinical correlation suggests problems with the afferent limb, CT is recommended.
HD 14 POD [**5-2**] ([**2123-5-12**]) HIDA scan: Severe hepatocellular disease, likely acute hepatitis Hepatology was consulted.
Recommendations as followed - wean and discontinue TPN - start ursodiol 600mg daily - please avoid hepatotoxic medications - check Hepatitis A IgM, Hepatitis B Anti Core Ab, Hepatitis B Surface Antigen, Hepatitic C Antibody to evaluate for possible underlying viral hepatitis: was negative.
HD 15 POD [**6-3**] ( [**2123-5-13**]) CXR: Right basilar consolidation has slightly increased.
The left bibasilar consolidation and moderate bilateral pleural effusions are  unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax.
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is  unchanged.
Vancomycin was added to his Abx regimen  HD 16 POD [**7-4**]  ([**2123-5-14**]) Physical therapy recommends rehabilitation center when ready to d/c Peritoneal cultures positive for ESCHERICHIA COLI ( resistant Ampi and Genta) and ENTEROCOCCUS SP.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusion are unchanged.
Moderate ascites.
Extensive pneumatosis involving the majority of the small bowel.
There is no evidence of portal venous air.
Change in caliber in loops in the right lower quadrant with at least three transition points.
These are most consistent with adhesions.
Overall, the picture is most likely that of a partial small-bowel obstruction.
