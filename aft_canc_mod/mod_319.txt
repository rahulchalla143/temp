There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild concentric hypertrophy with small left ventricular cavity size and hyperdynamic function.
[**10-9**] lung scan: Match chest X-ray, perfusion, and ventilation in the right lower lobe, triple match, has an indeterminate likelihood ratio for pulmonary embolism.
[**10-9**] CT head without contrast: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect or obvious major acute infarct.
[**10-9**] CXR: Right lower lobe pneumonia.

Hypotension: Poor PO intake and hypovolemia VS sepsis from PNA (elevated WBC's and CXR findings).
There was some concern for PE but pt had negative LENI, V/Q scan  which was indeterminate, echo with normal RV, and pt thought to be low pre-test likelihood for PE.
Echo with normal RV, hyperdynamic EF, but elevated LV filling pressure.
Pt was fluid resuscitated.
HCAP vs HAP: Pt with radiographic evidence of a RLL PNA, HAP versus HCAP given history with associated right sided pleuritic pain.
She denies cough or fever.
Also with new tremor, DDx including new Compazine medication vs Neurontin overdose in setting of worsening renal fxn [**12-25**] to hypovolemia from poor PO intake.
Acute on Chronic Renal failure: The patient's Cr was elevated to 2.8 on admission with a baseline of 1.1-1.2, still elevated based on her size, weight and age.
FeUrea was 0.02% consistent with pre-renal etiology.
Guaiac negative, no signs of bleeding or hemolysis given normal LFTs, but thrombocytosis concerning.
Hct slightly down from admission 32.4 --> 27.1 with iron deficiency and labs more consistent with chronic disease.
Thrombocytosis: The patient's thrombocytosis could be reactive from bleeding/anemia as above or from infection; essential or hemoconcentrational.
7. s/p CABG: Complicated by postop atrial fibrillation, currently in Sinus.
Elevated Troponin difficult to interpret given renal failure; CK elevated from hemolysis.
Cardiac [**Doctor First Name **] was consulted out of concern for her sternal wound but felt this to not be an acute issue or contributing to her overall clinical picture.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis -Pneumonia -Hypotension -Acute renal failure -Altered mental status  Secondary Diagnosis -Chronic diastolic congestive heart failure -Anemia   Discharge Condition: Blood pressure stable, mental status at baseline, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were treated in the hospital for pneumonia.
You were found to have acute renal failure, likely due to poor oral intake for several days prior to admission.
You also came in with mental status changes and tremors, thought to be due to increased levels of either Compazine or Neurontin since your kidneys were not able to clear these drugs properly.
You have been afebrile and are responding well to the antibiotics.
HOLD Neurontin and Compazine, as these medications may have caused altered mental status and tremors while you had renal failure.
If you develop altered mental status, increasing confusion, shortness of breath, chest pain, productive cough, lightheadedness, or any other concerning symptoms, please call your primary care doctor or return to the emergency department.
