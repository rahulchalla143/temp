Negative for malignant cells = = = = = = = = = ================================================================ RADIOLOGY [**2100-11-11**] - CT Head Without Contrast IMPRESSION: 1.
No acute intracranial process.
Stable age-related involution, small vessel ischemic disease, and bifrontal probable hygromas.
- CXR AP Portable IMPRESSION: Right lung consolidation persists, but decreased as compared to the prior study.
Possible small bilateral pleural effusions.
Low lung volumes.
Left perihilar opacity is again seen.
Worsening multilobar pneumonia centered within the right upper lobe.
Stable small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
No intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic abscess.
Stable periduodenal fluid and lower anterior abdominal wall fluid pocket along the prior surgical incision site.
No evidence of acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage.
Unchanged bilateral frontal subdural hygromas.
Generalized cerebral atrophy with changes of chronic small vessel ischemic  [**2100-11-19**] - RUQ U/S IMPRESSION: 1.
There are no signs of cholecystitis.
No biliary dilatation.
Bilateral pleural effusion.
There is no free air.
There is air seen in the small bowel and colon without evidence of dilatation.
There are sutures seen in the right lower quadrant and pelvis.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of megacolon, no evidence of obstruction.
Interval development of free intraabdominal air with a small fluid collection adjacent to the right lower quadrant enteric anastomosis.
High attenuation material within the fluid collection is highly concerning for an enteric anastamotic leak.
Bilateral pleural effusions with worsening left basal consolidation.
Other solid viscera are within normal limits within limits of a noncontrast examination.
Multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine worse at C4-5.
3.3 cc x 2.4 trv x 2.6 ap CM lesion in the right thyroid gland which was described on CT [**2100-11-11**], but new since [**9-4**].
Peri-anastomotic fluid collection containing oral contrast in keeping with persistent anastomotic leak.
[**2100-11-29**] GB scan: Markedly abnormal hepatobiliary scan.
Persistent cholestasis with no biliary excretion into either the gallbladder or the small bowel after an hour.
Interval worsening of tracer uptake compared with [**2100-11-22**], evident by persistent tracer activity in the heart after 60 minutes.
Activity within bowel at 24 hours suggests a primary hepatocellular disorder with delayed excretion into bowel, however, intermittent common bile duct obstruction is not excluded given the delayed biliary excretion into bowel.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 yo M with history of ESRD s/p renal transplant, recent hemicolectomy for stage 1 colon cancer presented with altered mental status.
Course complicated by septic shock, respiratory failure requiring intubation and subsequently trach, and bowel perforation.
Details of his hospitalization are listed below:  # Septic shock.
Initial source was thought to be pneumonia based on clinical findings and imaging.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl initially to cover HCAP and aspiration pneumonia and fluconazole for possible infected fluid collection in the abdomen, as it was previously found to have yeast.
Azithromycin was also added to cover possible atypical pneumonia.
Colorectal surgery evaluated patient for possible infection of the fluid collection and sent a swab that was done around the fluid collection, and it was unable to be probed through.
With multiple antimicrobials, otherwise negative microbiology data, and improving clinical status off pressors, infectious disease recommended narrowing antimicrobials to fluconazole only after completion of a week course of antibiotics for pneumonia.
Fluconazole was changed to micafungin for concern of rising alkaline phosphatase.
He was peri-septic again in the setting of bowel perforation (see below), requiring IVF boluses.
# Bowel perforation/Peri-anastomotic leak.
This was discovered as part of the work up for his worsening leukocytosis after a period of improvement, abdominal tenderness, and worsening hemodynamics (AF with RVR, new borderline hypotension) requiring fluid boluses.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure.
He was treated for presumed pneumonia although no identifiable infectious source was identified via bronchoscopy.
However, he was unable to be weaned off of the ventilator due to tachypnea/respiratory alkalosis and also ICU myopathy.
It is likely that the respiratory alkalosis is [**3-3**] pain/discomfort, for which fentanyl was given.
# Altered mental status/Delirium.
[**3-3**] presumed pneumonia complicated by respiratory failure and later bowel perforation and pain.
Hence, had further MRI imaging of the head to rule out intracranial process and neurology consult.
# Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
# Anticoagulation/Supratherapeutic INR.
He was switched to heparin gtt for anticoagulation given underlying AF, history of DVT, and the frequent possibility of requiring procedures.
However, it was transitioned to heparin subcutaneously after discovery of the perianastomotic leak, requiring the possibility of surgical intervention.
# ICU myopathy.
Suggested by his inability to be weaned off ventilator and persistent weakness.
MRI C-spine without findings of cord compression.
