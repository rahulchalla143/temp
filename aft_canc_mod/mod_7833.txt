Admission Date:  [**2145-4-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2145-5-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2082-10-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: E-Mycin / Amoxicillin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**] Chief Complaint: SOB, chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis  History of Present Illness: 62 yo F with metastatic breast cancer, on Xeloda and Herceptin since [**2138**] (herceptin alone since [**2135**]), presents with 1 week of CP and SOB.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] ordered by her PCP showed bilateral pleural effusions for which she was sent to the ED.
CTA showed bilateral pleural effusions, moderate pericardial effusion worse than before, but no PE or aortic dissection.
She had a viral cold recently.
In [**2132**], around the same time that she was diagnosed with breast cancer, she was also found to have pleural and pericardial effusions, preceded by a viral prodrome.
She had a thoracentesis that did not reveal malignant cells.
It was concluded that this was a viral related serositis and not due to metastatic breast cancer.
On this admission, another TTE was obtained which showed echocardiographic evidence for cardiac tamponade.
She had a CT chest 2 weeks ago for cancer staging purposes which showed a small pericardial effusion.
Currently, patient feels some soreness in her chest where the pericardiocentesis was performed.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: Breast cancer - diagnosed [**2132**], s/p R mastectomy, on herceptin since [**2135**] and xeloda since [**2138**] Hypothyroidism h/o one past episode of pericardial effusion in [**2132**]   Social History: She is divorced and is a ticketing officer with american airlines.
There is no other breast or ovarian cancer in her family.
Her father died of lymphoma  Physical Exam: On trasnfer to CCU VS: 145/70, 98, 26, 93% 2L Pulsus: 18 mmHg GEN: Pleasant, well appearing woman in NAD, mildly dyspneic HEENT: PERRLA, EOMI, MMM, OP clear, no LAD, JVP low LUNGS: bibasilar crackles with pleural effusion R>L CVS: S1S2, RRR, no m/r/g ABD: soft, ND, NT, +BS, no ascites EXT: 1+ bilateral pedal edema to ankles, 2+ peripheral pulses NEURO: CN II-XII grossly intact, no focal deficits   Pertinent Results: Cardiac Cath Study Date of [**2145-4-29**] COMMENTS: 1- Emergent pericardiocentesis was performed via subxyphoid access in the usual fashion.
Successful emergent pericardiocentesis and removal of >600 cc of bloody fluid 3.
Postprocedure bedside echocardiography showed resolution of pericardial effusion and well expanded RA and RV without tamponade physiology 5.
No pulmonary embolus or acute aortic syndrome.
Large (new) pericardial effusion, raising concern for tamponade.
Enlargement of bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small on the left, with associated compressive atelectasis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a large pericardial effusion.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
There is echocardiographic evidence for cardiac tamponade.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The right ventricle is larger without evidence of tamponade physiology.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
Study consistent with effusive-constrictive physiology following drainage of pericardial effusion.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2145-4-29**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2145-5-2**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2145-4-30**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):    FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
Brief Hospital Course: 62 F with metastatic breast cancer with acute onset bilateral pleural effusion and worsening pericardial effusion found to have tamponade physiology.
PUMP/Tamponade - patient has a history of one other episode of pericardial effusion in [**2132**], likely of viral etiology, which resolved on its own.
Two weeks ago on CT chest for staging purposes, she was found to have a small pericardial effusion and no pleural effusion.
On admission, she had no clinical evidence of tamponade, however TTE showed significant pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
She had a viral cold recently, and the rapid onset symptoms could again suggest a viral serositis, however would not explain the presence of blood in pericardial fluid.
She has no signs of infection: no white count or fever.
Malignant effusion remains high on the differential; her breast cancer has been stable for years, however the presence of blood and 40% other cells in pericardial fluid raises this suspicion.
Herceptin has a <1% occurrence of pericardial effusion, unlikely to be the culprit as she has been on it stabily since [**2135**].
Patient does not appear uremic on labs nor does she have a history of collagen vascular disease.
A repeat echo done on [**2145-5-4**] showed no recurrent fluid.
Pleural effusions: Pt with bilateral pleural effusions that appear new since early [**Month (only) 116**].
High suspicion for malignancy.
As the pt was satting well on room air and asymptomatic, there was no plan for thoracocentesis at the time of discharge.
BREAST CANCER - chemotherapy was held during this admission per oncology recommendations.
Fluticasone 50 mcg 2 sprays each nostril daily Ibuprofen 600 mg TID prn pain Levothyroxine 75 mcg daily Lorazepam 1 mg qhs Zolpidem 10 mg qhs prn insomnia  Discharge Medications: 1.
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
Zolpidem 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: (1) Pericardial Effusion (2) Pleural effusions (3) Breast cancer history   Discharge Condition: Stable for home; ambulating on room air, mild shortness of breath on activity.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms [**Last Name (Titles) 5025**],  You were admitted because you had worsening shortness of breath.
This occurred because we found you had accumulated fluid around your heart and lungs.
We don't know for sure yet why you have fluid in these areas, but it can happen because of your breast cancer history.
Please call your doctor immediately or return to the emergency department if you start to feel increasingly short of breath, dizzy or lightheaded, or have any other concerning symptoms.
