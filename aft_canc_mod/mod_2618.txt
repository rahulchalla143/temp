No definite evidence by laparoscopic ultrasound of unresectability.
Bile duct thickening noted, although most likely due to a inflammatory thickening from the indwelling stent.
Adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head, see synoptic report.
Dilation and chronic active inflammation of the common bile duct and pancreatic duct.
Chronic cholecystitis.
Marked hyperplasia of the cholecystic duct lymph node.
EXTENT OF INVASION Primary Tumor:  pT3:  Tumor extends beyond the pancreas but without involvement of the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery.
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN0:  No regional lymph node metastasis.
Part 1 is additionally labeled "Whipple specimen" and consists of duodenum with attached pancreatic head.
The pancreatic head measures 7.5 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm.
The duodenum, common bile duct and pancreatic duct are opened.
There is a 1.0 x 0.6 cm ulcerated lesion in the common bile duct, 2.0 cm from the resection margin.
The pancreatic parenchyma is sectioned to reveal the tan lobular cut surface with patchy firmness.
There is periductal firmness that measures up to 3 cm.
The specimen is represented as follows:  A = uncinate pancreatic margin, B = bile duct margin, C = 2.9 cm stapled margin bile duct, D = 2.3 cm shaved staple margin (distal), E = unremarkable duodenal mucosa, F-H = ampulla, I-N = ulcer, O-U = firmness area, V-W = pancreatic duct, X-Y = unremarkable pancreatic parenchyma, Z-AA = pancreatic duct with adjacent fat, BA-IA = surrounding pancreatic fat with possible lymph nodes.
It is opened to reveal an unremarkable small bowel mucosa.
The serosal surface is also remarkable for a 3.0 x 0.4 cm yellow linear scar.
The gallbladder is opened to reveal a green-tan velvety mucosa and less than 10 cc of yellow -green bile.
The specimen is represented as follows:  MA = bisected cystic duct node, NA = sections through cystic duct, OA = sections through gallbladder wall.
Tiny bilateral effusions and patchy air-space disease at the right base, possibly representing pneumonia.
Large abscess collection within the pancreatic bed, as described above.
A second smaller fluid collection to the right of the abscess also suspicious for early abscess formation.
Mild thickening of the rectum, a nonspecific finding.
Air within the bladder without evidence for Foley catheter.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was transfered to the regular floor and follow the Whipple Protocol with out complications initially.
She had postop fever and Enterococo was isolated from Urine (UTI), she recieved antibiotics with a good response.
She persisted with isolated episodes of vomiting and was found to have (by CT scan) a little colection peripancreatic (see reports).
