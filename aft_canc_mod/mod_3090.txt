On postoperative check, the patient was noted to be afebrile and stable with complaint of lethargy and nausea.
Patient's dressing was noted to be mildly saturated with serosanguinous fluid, but was otherwise unremarkable and intact.
Postoperative antibiosis was provided via Ancef; postoperative pain control was provided via Morphine, Toradol, and Percocet.
Approximately two hours following the [**Hospital 228**] transfer to the floor, house officer was called to evaluate the patient secondary to patient's complaint of discomfort and "urge to urinate".

A followup CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was negative for any evidence of additional bleeding or perforation.
