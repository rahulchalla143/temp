gentleman with significant CAD hx, s/p MI x 4, RCA stents x 4 (most recent placed in [**2147**]), COPD, bladder cancer (w/lung mets), who presented to [**Hospital3 1280**] with chest pain w/jaw and L arm pain similar to previous MI.
Pt had to stop ASA and Plavix 1 month ago due to ongoing signficant hematuria related to bladder cancer tx which required blood transfusions and PRN 3 way irrigation.
On cath he was found to have thrombosis of the RCA stent which was treated with balloon angioplasty in addition to 90% proximal LAD lesion.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for PCI of LAD and had hospital course complicated by hematuria requiring transfusions.
# CAD:  Pt has significant CAD hx w/multiple MIs, symptoms of chest pain/pressure radiating to jaw and arms are identical to symptoms he's had in past.
Cath at [**Hospital3 1280**] found to have thrombosis of the RCA stent which was treated with balloon angioplasty in addition to 90% proximal LAD lesion.
Placed BMS b/c of issues with plavix causing bleeding in setting of bladder cancer (undergoing chemotherapy).
Transferred for PCI of LAD lesion which was successful with placement of another BMS.
Some question and concern of possible bruit but site looked good and faint bruits bilateral in setting of significant vascular disease.
Pt was deemed ready for discharge when he began to have large amount of hematuria which rapidly worsened and necessitated urology consult and transfer to the CCU (see below).
# Bladder Cancer: Pt has known metastatic bladder cancer (mets to lung).
Had to be taken off plavix and aspirin b/c he was having significant hematuria which required multiple transfusions; bleeding from tumor.
On day he was about to be discharged ([**2154-5-9**]) he acutely developed significant hematuria requiring blood transfusion, urgent urology consult for placement of foley for irrigation and transfer to CCU.
Placement of foley was very difficult even with cystoscopy, so patient was transferred to OR on east for rigid cystoscopy which revealed 1.5 U clotted blood in bladder with no evidence of active bleed and left bladder metastasis.
# Anxiety: Given recent cancer diagnosis and stresses related to medical issues patient was having worsening anxiety symptoms and was given ativan to help w/anxiety symptoms.
