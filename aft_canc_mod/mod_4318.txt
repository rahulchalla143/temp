Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated severe native three vessel disease.
The LAD had severe mid-vessel disease up to 90% at D1.
The LCx had severe diffuse disease.
The RI had a 90% ostial stenosis in a long vessel.
The RCA was flush occluded at the ostium and fills by left to right collaterals.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akiesis of all distal segments and apex as well as severe hypokinesis of the mid portions of all inferior and lateral segments.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis and severe focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Right ventricular systolic function is improved but distal free wall hypokinesis remains.
The left ventricle displays improved function of the moderate global hypokinesis but the focal abnormalities noted in the pre-bypass persist.
There is a mitral valve annuloplasty ring in situ.
There is trace mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral stenosis.
On [**2136-11-16**] he underwent cardiac cath which revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
Echo done on [**11-16**] revealed moderate mitral regurgitation.
He received medical management over the next several days and clearance from oncology/hematology for his prostate cancer and nephrology for dialysis.
On [**11-20**] he was brought to the Operating Room where he underwent coronary artery bypass graft x 5 and mitral valve repair.
CTs remained in place for several days due to the serous output, but were removed without incident on POD 5.
He remained on Vasopressin for hypotension for several days post op and was eventually weaned off completely on POD 6.
He had poor oral intake and supplements were started as well as calorie counts.low dose beta blocker was subsequently added.
He developed abdominal cramping and loose stool which resolved.
He remained afebrile with normal white blood cell count and CDiff toxin was negative.

4. magnesium hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
6. bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
7. pramoxine-mineral oil-zinc 1-12.5 % Ointment Sig: One (1) Appl Rectal TID PRN () as needed for hemorrhoid pain.
