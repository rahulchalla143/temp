Oncologic History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
- [**10/2092**]: Diagnosed during evaluation of mildly abnormal LFTs.
Left nephrectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed, with pathology demonstrating clear cell carcinoma, grade III/IV, displacing the kidney capsule with no nodular or vascular involvement.
- [**2099**]:  The patient completed 40 weeks on bevacizumab plus erlotinib (on protocol), which she discontinued in [**4-/2100**] secondary to disease progression.
- [**5-/2100**]:  She began sunitinib therapy on the SU11248 trial at 50 mg daily and was shortly thereafter admitted to the hospital for fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, jaundice, and pruritus; her medication was held for four weeks with resolution of symptoms and was subsequently restarted at 37.5 mg daily.
- [**12/2101**]:  The patient experienced a fall with a pelvic fracture, managed conservatively.
The fracture site was biopsied and showed no metastatic disease.
- [**2102-4-19**] CT scan:  Stable hepatic lesions with a mild decrease in size of the previously noted portacaval lymph node.
- [**2102-7-17**] CT scan:  Minimal increase in overall disease burden, with a slight increase in the size of target lesions.
T4 vertebral body sclerosis and collapse concerning for metastases.
- [**2102-10-30**] MRI: Pathologic compression fracture of T4 vertebral body without retropulsion to the canal.
There is a cystic structure measuring 1.4 x 1.3 cm, immediately anterior to the compressed vertebral body, which could represent cystic node, posterior mediastinal bronchogenic or enterogenous cyst or meningocele.
- [**2101-12-31**]:  Due to progressive disease and inability to tolerate sunitinib, the patient signed consent for participation in the avid 07-113 trial, on which she began 20 mg of the ABT 869 study drug.

-[**4-29**]: drug held due to transient loss of vision.

Although this idiosyncratic reaction often presents within two months of starting the drug, and this patient started the medication six years ago, this is a possible trigger.
The patient was given a short prednisone burst and antihistamines, to which she showed complete resolution of symptoms in ~12 hours.
Given her current ongoing malignancy, we opted to keep her on Sutent for now pending further discussion with her outpatient oncologist, with whom she is scheduled to visit as an outpatient the day following discharge.
The patient could also benefit from Allergy follow-up as an outpatient for further workup of her tongue swelling.
# mild AMS - Patient developed mild confusion the AM of discharge, which we believe was most likely due to excessive anti-histamine use coupled with zolpidem 10 mg qhs.
