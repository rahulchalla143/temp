[**2107-12-12**] -PICC placement   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 78 yoM with h/o DM2, HTN, CKD (Cr was 2.4 on [**2107-11-26**] on last admission), CAD s/p MI on [**2107-11-26**], who presents with 3 days of lumbar back pain and F/C/rigors.
The day prior to admission, the patient went to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for acute on chronic lower extremity weakness without trauma (he normally uses two canes to ambulate, which is thought to be due to spinal stenosis).
He was found to be febrile to 104 with progressive right leg weakness and decreased rectal tone.
At [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], C/T/L spine MRI was concerning for epidural abscess though it was a poor quality film as they did not use gadolinium given CRI.
He was also found to have a UTI (has a urosomy bag) and was started on vanco/cipro prior to transfer for the UTI, possible leg cellulitis and epidural abscess.
He subsequently underwent an ECHO with limited views which revealed hypokinesis of the distal septum, apex and distal anterior and inferior walls with an EF of 45% and no prior ECHO for comparison.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There are filamentous strands on the aortic leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.

Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No 2D echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
Within this limitation, no evidence of septic emboli.
There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, large mass, mass effect or infarction.
Sequelae of chronic microvascular infarction noted.
There is no hydronephrosis bilaterally.
Although son[**Name (NI) 493**] penetration is difficult, no obvious renal mass or calculi are seen bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis .
[**12-9**] LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler evaluation of left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, and basilic veins demonstrate normal compressibility, flow, response to augmentation wherever applicable.
There is an intraluminal thrombus distending the left cephalic vein with lack of compressibility of the left cephalic vein consistent with left cephalic thrombosis.
There is no color flow within the thrombosed vein suggesting a nearly occlusive thrombus.
IMPRESSION: Nearly occlusive left cephalic vein thrombus.
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left upper extremity.
Vancomycin trough: 24.5   Brief Hospital Course: 78 year old male with sig vascular risk factors, admitted with suspected spontaneous epidural abscess and cauda equina syndrome.
CAUDA EQUINA SYNDROME: On presentation, the patient clinically had cauda equina syndrome with decreased rectal tone and progressive RLE weakness.
MRI on admission did not demonstrate epidural abscess, though it was concerning for epidural lipomatosis, per ortho spine.
Patient was initially on Vanc/Zosyn on [**2107-12-3**] for broad spectrum coverage, and which was subsequently switched to Nafcillin following speciation per ID recs.
TTE and TEE showed no evidence of endocarditis.
Patient was switched from Nafcillin to Vancomycin due to Allergic Intersitial Nephritis with Renal Failure.
Patient had evidence of delirium, so given negative repeat urine culture ciprofloxacin was stopped after a 3 day antibiotic course and patient was monitored.
Cardiac enzymes showed troponin leak and p-MIBI showed normal myocardial perfusion.
Troponin leak was felt to be both demand in setting infection, due to increasing renal failure and perhaps resolving enzymes from STEMI.
Urine lytes were sent and revealed allergic interstitial nephritis due to eosinophils and FeNa 1.5%.
HTN, benign:  The patient had borderline low BPs when started on cardiac meds including beta-blocker & imdur per cards recs pre-op.
He then became hypertensive to SBPs of 180s on [**12-10**] and [**12-11**].

LUE U/S demonstrated nearly occlusive left cephalic vein thrombosis but no evidence of DVT.
CT head showed no acute event.
No other infections identified.
Patient's opioids, ambien and ciprofloxacin were stopped with improvement in patient's mental status.
ANEMIA of CHRONIC DISEASE: HCT 32 on admission.
Iron and B12, Folate studies revealed anemia of chronic disease.
PMR: Has h/o PMR and is on chronic prednisone.
Checked with ID - no need for prophylaxis as dose not high enough.
Polyethylene Glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: Seventeen (17) grams PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.

Vancomycin 1g based on level   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location 1268**] VA  Discharge Diagnosis: Cauda equina syndrome, MSSA bacteremia, UTI, acute on chronic kidney injury  Secondary diagnoses: -CAD s/p STEMI [**2107-11-26**] (medically managed) -IDDM -dyslipidemia -HTN -CKI -polymyalgia rheumatica -bladder cancer s/p urostomy -depression   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent, sometimes confused Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 **] Hospital for evaluation of lower back pain associated with fevers, chills, and rigors.
You were diagnosed with cauda equina syndrome which occurs when there is compression of your spinal cord.
You were also found to have an infection in your blood with a bacteria called MSSA.
You were treated with nafcillin, which unfortunately worsened your kidney function due to a process called allergic interstitial nephritis.
You will require a total of 4 weeks of treatment with vancomycin and for that reason, a more permanent IV called a PICC was placed before your discharge to the VA. You also developed a urinary tract infection which responded well to treatment with ciprofloxacin.
The following changes have been made to your home medications: - Your home carvedilol dose has been increased to 25mg twice daily - Your home lisinopril dose has been held for now and may be restarted at the discretion of the VA - Your home simvastatin was changed to Lipitor 80mg daily - You were started on Senna, docusate, and Miralax to help move your bowels - You will use Tylenol as needed for your pain  Please follow-up with all of your outpatient medical appointments listed below.
