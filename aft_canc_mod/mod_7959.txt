Briefly, she is s/p lap chole [**2152-7-4**] and lap SBR/LOA [**2152-7-22**] who presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**2152-8-14**] with vague abdominal pain.
Her abdominal pain continued to worsen and she developed signs of peritonitis with a CT scan showing ischemic colitis and pneumatosis.
She underwent an exploratory laparotomy, resection ischemic/necrotic small bowel, debridement of necrotic rectum, sigmoid and descending colon with temporary abdominal closure on [**2152-8-22**].
Prior to her planned take back for a second look, she developed sudden left lower extremity ischemia which required a left femoral artery embolectomy on [**2152-8-24**] and following her embolectomy, she was started on a heparin drip.
She had a delayed return of bowel function and was started on TPN with her starting to take POs in mid-[**Month (only) 359**] and recently started on Coumadin  She was doing well until [**9-23**] when she started to have melena from her ostomy.
She continued to have melena from her ostomy and her aspirin, heparin and Coumadin were held with an INR of 2.6 on [**2152-9-25**] down to 2.2 on [**2152-9-26**].
She underwent a upper GI endoscopy which revealed no active bleeding source.
She has been stable for the previous 24 hours (28.4,29.3,29.5,28.6) but has continued to have dark burgundy output from her ostomy with an INR of 1.6.
Currently, she reports that she has minimal incisional pain.
She has had no nausea or vomiting.

Family History: Colorectal cancer   Physical Exam: Admssion: GEN: Alert and oriented x3, No acute distress HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: Regular rate and rhythm, No Murmurs/rubs/gallops PULM: Clear to auscultation bilaterally ABD: Soft, nondistended, appropriately Tender to palpation around incision, no rebound or guarding, normoactive bowel sounds, no palpable masses.
DRE: normal tone, no gross or occult blood.
Dsicharge: GEN: Alert and oriented x3, No acute distress HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: Regular rate and rhythm, No Murmurs/rubs/gallops PULM: Clear to auscultation bilaterally ABD: Soft, nondistended, appropriately Tender to palpation around incision, no rebound or guarding, normoactive bowel sounds, no palpable masses.
Extensive atherosclerotic disease as described above including mild celiac axis stenosis, right common femoral artery stenosis, infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, focal aneurysmal dilatation of the left iliac artery.
Probable chronic infarct involving the spleen.
No active extravasation.
Postoperative changes within the pelvis including areas of expected bowel wall thickening, predominantly small bowel, left lower quadrant colostomy, Hartmann's pouch, well-delineated and thick walled small fluid collection which is unchanged from the prior exam and is not amenable to CT-guided or ultrasound-guided drainage.
Apparent open midline incision, small right-sided fat-containing spigelian hernia which appears uncomplicated.
Endomucosal resection was not attempted given recent GI bleed.
Suture material at the anastomotic site at the ileo-cecal valve Otherwise normal colonoscopy   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the ACS service on [**2152-9-26**].
Interventional radiology was consulted and recommended CTA of the abdomen and pelvis, which showed no active bleeding.
This showed larger ulcer at anastamosis site and this was clipped.
The patient was transferred to the floor on [**9-28**] and became therapuetic on heparin gtt on [**2152-9-30**] at 0300 and has remained therapuetic since then running at heparin drip of 1200 units/hour.
She did not have bleeeding from ostomy site since [**2152-9-28**] after the clipping procedure and has had stable hematocrit since then, as it was checked daily.
Vascular surgery was consulted at the request of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 91608**] and agreed that the patient needed long term anticoagulation of heparin with a bridge to coumadin and thought that there was no prophylactic surgical intervention at this time to prevent further atheroembolisms.
