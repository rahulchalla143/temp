HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 77 year old female with colon cancer undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy with 5FU and Leucovorin.
For about one week prior to admission, the patient had the onset of severe diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Additional complaints included abdominal pain.
The patient treated symptoms with Imodium with some effect.
Abdominal pain was continuing to get worse and she is therefore being admitted for management of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain.
No shortness of breath and no chest pain.
Diastolic dysfunction.
Aortic stenosis with aortic valve repair in [**2170**] with a bovine valve, not anti-coagulated, mild coronary artery disease.
Total abdominal hysterectomy.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   In no acute distress.
Dry mucous membranes.
Good air movement with no crackles.
S1, loud S2, II/VI systolic murmur best heard at the right apex.
Extremities with no edema.
Skin with no lesions.
While on the Floor, the patient was noticed to develop worsening abdominal pain and there was evidence of developing small bowel obstruction.
Several days into the course, the patient developed what appeared to be an episode of massive aspiration with probable aspiration of fecal material.
At that point, she became acutely hypoxic, hypotensive and required intubation and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
She recovered relatively well from the acute septic episodes and her blood pressure returned to [**Location 213**] in a few days.
Of note, she had no episodes of clotting or bleeding.
She initially tolerated extubation well, however, after a few hours, had worsening O2 saturations, became hypertensive and tachycardia.
Eventually, she was in respiratory distress and required re-intubation.
Of note, the patient had a very difficult airway.
For the next five days, she had a very uneventful course, was off all antibiotics with no signs of infection.
This extubation was much more successful and the patient tolerated this very well with no complications.
From a surgical standpoint, there are no reasons why she cannot tolerate a full diet after her colon cancer resection.
About two days prior discharge, the patient experienced new onset of left shoulder pain which is probably a result of moving from her bed to her chair.
The pain is worse with motion and is absent at rest, which most likely posed a musculoskeletal course.
Of note, she has had prior gastrointestinal upsets and ulcers on aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, so at this point, it is most prudent to treat the pain with Tylenol and very weak opioids.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Currently the patient is extremely deconditioned and non-ambulatory, breathing comfortably on face mask and being fed per post-pyloric feeding tube, alert and oriented, very interactive and appropriate.
Aspiration pneumonia.
