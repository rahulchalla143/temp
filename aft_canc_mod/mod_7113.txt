He has had severe pain issues related to a pathologic fracture of his left humerus.
Approximately one week ago, he developed fever and cough consistent with an upper respiratory infeciton.
He was prescribed a 10 day course of levofloxacin and clinically improved with resolved fever and improved cough.
He was having visual hallucinations and was "babbling."
He was taken to an OSH for evaluation and was found to have multiple laboratory abnormalities, including an INR of 12 (given 2 units FFP and vitamin K 10 mg) and a potassium of 6.4 (given bicarbonate, insulin/D50), ALT 1327, AST 4193, Cr 3.9, TB 0.9 and he was given levofloxacin 750.
His evaluation revealed multiple laboratory abnormalities.
He was treated for hyperkalemia with Insulin and kayexelate and admitted to the ICU.
The patient presented with postobstructive pneumonia in [**2131-9-26**].
Flexible bronchoscopy on [**2131-10-5**] showed a mass in the left upper lobe bronchus extending into the main bronchus.
Cytology from FNA was positive for squamous cell carcinoma.
Biopsy from transbronchial biopsies at different levels of mediastinal hilar lymph nodes returned back negative for malignant cells.
PET CT on [**2131-11-1**] showed a large FDG avid left upper lobe pulmonary mass encasing the left main bronchus FDG avid mediastinal lymphadenopathy and FDG avidity in the left proximal humerus concerning for metastatic disease.
Brain MRI on [**2131-11-2**] - no evidence of intracranial metastasis.
MRI of the left humerus showed heterogeneous left humeral intramedullary lesion suggestive of metastatic disease 6.

[**12-4**] CXR: PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: There is no significant interval change from prior.
Again seen is opacification of the left hemithorax representing a combination of moderate-sized left pleural effusion and left hilar mass.
The right lung is unchanged with a spiculated right upper lobe nodule redemonstrated as well as subpleural reticular opacities.
Multiple old left-sided rib fractures are noted.
Fracture of the left proximal humerus proximally is seen with medial displacement by approximately half-shaft width.
The fracture is through a pre-existing permeative lesion as seen on the prior humerus radiographs.
IMPRESSION: Displaced pathologic fracture of the proximal left humerus.
[**12-5**] RUQ u/s: FINDINGS: The liver demonstrates no focal or textural abnormalities.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation, with the common bile duct measuring up to 4 mm.
Note is made of a small amount of ascites demonstrated around the liver, and also within the right lower and left lower quadrants, new from prior examination.
There is gallbladder wall edema and thickening of the gallbladder wall measuring up to 4 mm.
No evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
New intra-abdominal ascites, small in extent.
Slightly distended gallbladder with wall edema, non-specific in setting of ascites and low albumin, may be secondary to third spacing of fluids, though if clinical concern for acute cholecystitis, HIDA is recommended.
[**12-7**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional ventricular systolic function.
Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle with evidence of pressure/volume overload and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Small, circumferential effusion without evidence of tamponade physiology.
New small right pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.
Stable large left pleural effusion with small increase in associated atelectasis.
New interstitial edema versus right aspiration.
There is a small right pleural effusion and a large left pleural effusion which appear fairly stable.
There is evidence for underlying compressive atelectasis on the left lung.
The left pleural effusion largely obscures the cardiac silhouette.

While a poor historian, the patient clearly reports an acute change in mental status occuring the morning of admission.
He is on multiple medications for pain and for psychiatric stability and he is unclear about what or how much of any particular medication he is taking.
Altered Mental Status: Patient with known schizoaffective disorder though mental status on presenation was different from baseline according to patient, including inability to recall what and how frequently he had been taking medications.
Mr. [**Known lastname 105240**] was intermittently sleepy and sometimes difficult to arouse, notably when he took pain medications.
Prior to discharge we changed his breakthrough pain medication from dilaudid to oxycodone to see if this improved his mental status.
Metastatic Lung Cancer: Most recently Mr. [**Known lastname 105240**] was treated with palliative Navelbine.
During hospitalization, Mr. [**Known lastname 105240**] had both neutropenia and hypoxia/shortness of breath related to the metastatic lung cancer.
Hypoxia: As per outpatient records, has been ongoing for several weeks.
During hospitalization, Mr. [**Known lastname 105240**] had persistent oxygen requirement and intermittently desaturated into the 80s and required a face mask.
This was likely multifactorial, [**1-27**] worsening malignancy, COPD, volume overload, possible pneumonia, and pulmonary hypertension.
The patient was found to have effusions and inflitrates of the right lung.
The patient was diuresed with IV lasix and also was treated for hospital acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and cefepime and aspiration pneumonia with flagyl.
Neutropenia: Patient had neutropenic fever at transfer from the ICU to the oncology floor.
The patient remained profoundly neutropenic.
The patient remained afebrile for 7 days and his counts improved.
Neurontin was restarted but the patient was very sedated so the medication was stopped.
The patient was transitioned to oxycodone for break through pain as it may be less sedating for the patient.
Hypotension: On arrival to ICU, differential was broad including sepsis, hypovolemia, or adrenal insufficiency.
Given concern for sepsis, blood cultures were performed, patient received vigorous intravenous fluids, and was started on Vancomycin given possible infiltrate seen on CXR and Cefepime given neutropenia.
Patient's hypotension gradually improved with systolics in the 110s on the day of transfer to the medicine service.
Acute Renal Failure: On presentation, there was concern for acute kidney injury from either hypovolemia or drug-mediated injury.
Renal failure improved with hydration and holding of NSAIDs.
Metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia were considered secondary to acute renal failure.
Acute Liver Injury: On admission, AST was 3171, ALT was 1028, and LDH was 2945 without elevations in alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin.
Toxicology was consulted and was concerned for Tylenol overdose, though patient was certain he had been taking Oxycodone and had not been taking Percocet nor any Tylenol.
Elevated INR more likely result of Warfarin with Levofloxacin than coagulalopathy from acute liver disease.
Hemoptysis and Hematuria: Occurred the ICU, in the setting of supratherapeutic INR.
Initial concern for possible infectious etiology of pneumonia for hemoptysis and UTI for hematuria.
Both episodes were self-limited and no further episodes occurred with reversal of anti-coagulation.
History of Schizoaffective Disorder: Patient was continued on Celexa initially but Zyprexa and Clonazepam were held given initial altered mental status.
There was concern that patient's initial presentation could have been medication overdose for suicide attempt.
