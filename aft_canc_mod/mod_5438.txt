He was prepared by a Pulmonology consult deemed to be an acceptable but high risk for pancreatic resection and he opted to proceed.
He was electively brought to the operating room for a planned Whipple procedure, but intra-operatively it was noted that serosal implants existed beyond the nodal disease which rendered this stage IV pancreatic cancer and the operation was aborted.
Father died at of pancreatic cancer at age 72.
CVS: Regular rate and rhythm, without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
RESP: Clear to auscultation bilaterally without adventitious sounds.
No wheezing, rhonchi or crackles.
No masses or peritoneal signs.
EXTR: no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, 2+ peripheral pulses INCISION: incision is clean, dry and intact, without evidence of erythema or drainage, staples have been removed.

No evidence of pneumothorax is present.
Increased bilateral lung lucency most likely reflects emphysema  [**2136-7-2**] CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: status-post CCY, with a moderate amount of free intermediate density fluid in the perihepatic region and gallbladder fossa, extending to the inferior margin of the liver.
No rim enhancement.
Biliary stent in place, with minimal pneumobilia, without biliary dilation.
Stable pancreatic ductal dilation, secondary to known pancreatic mass.
Mild narrowing of the SMV, just proximal to the confluence.
Bilateral trace pleural effusions with basal atelectasis.
No retroperitoneal air to suggest duodenal perforation.
Brief Hospital Course: NEURO/PAIN: The patient was maintained on IV pain medication in the immediate post-operative period and transitioned to PO narcotic medication with adequate pain control on POD#3.
The patient had some mental status changes in the post-operative period, which was attributed to his medications versus acute post-op delirium changes.
He had serial neurologic exams.
His medication list was optimized to avoid anticholingeric or delirium-inducing medications.
He did experience some episodic hypotension post-op requiring re-intubation and fluid resuscitation.
His ABG revealed evidence of hypercarbia and carbon dioxide retention post-op and he required re-intubation on POD#0.
The patient had no episodes of desaturation or pulmonary concerns following being extubated after this pulmonary episode.
The patient denied cough or respiratory symptoms following this, and was maintained on nebulizers and pulmonary treatments.
He had a CXR on POD#5 which showed some right lower lobe atelectasis, but otherwise was reassuring.
The patient experienced no nausea or vomiting.
His WBC was elevated to 21, he spiked low grade temperatures and had new-onset tachycardiac (with stable EKG findings) which raised the concern for anastomotic leak or intra-abdominal bleeding.
On POD#4, an upright abdominal X-ray revealed no free air and a CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed only a simple peri-hepatic fluid collection with post-operative changes and no extravasation of contrast or perforation.
On POD#4 a Foley catheter was replaced for some low urine output and the need for monitoring given the previous concerns for anastomotic leak or bleeding.
The patient had no evidence of bleeding from their incision.
ID: Their white count was 21 post-operatively (POD#4) and their incision was closely monitored for any evidence of infection or erythema.
The patient initially only received standard peri-operative antibiotics, but was started on empiric IV Vancomycin and Zosyn on the evening of POD#4 given concerns for anastomotic leak or infection.
Blood and urine cultures were obtained for low grade temperatures.
Blood cultures revealed [**3-16**] bottle positive for gram negative rods which speciated E.coli that was pan-sensitive.
The patient also had sequential compression boot devices in place during immobilization to promote circulation.
