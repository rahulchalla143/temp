Admission Date:  [**2128-8-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-8-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2076-2-13**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**] Chief Complaint: tachycardia, worsened right sided chest/abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 52 year old female with history of hyperlipidemia, hypretension and colon cancer treated previously with surgery, chemo (FOLFIRI plus Avastin, previously treated with FOLFOX)and XRT in [**State 9512**] (approx 1 month ago) with known metastases and progresion of disease, for which no longer treatment is being received.
She presents with right sided trunk (chest & abd) pain along with tachycardia.
She has had ongoing pleuritic right chest pain for 1 month.
She denies any central chest pain.
She is unable to walk at baseline secondary to weakness and per her family this has been the case for quite some time.
She is on Vicodin for her pain but in the last 2 days the pain has been worse.
Past Medical History: - colon cancer [**2123**] s/p LN dissection [**2126**] - hypertension - Hypercholesterolemia - nerve system problem, wheelchair bound since [**2111**], describes that started in her legs and feels numbness/tingling and has weakness.
- Tobacco:  past smoker, 20 pack year history - Alcohol:  negative   Family History:  noncontributory   Physical Exam: Admission Physical Exam: Vitals: 129/76, 126 HR, 98/RA General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Decreased breathsounds right base.
CV: Tachycardic with regular rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly.
Surgical scar midline inferior to umbilicus with smaller RUQ scars GU: foley in place Skin: Hickman left chest wall with very mild surrounding erythema, femoral CVL right appears normal Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema .
Discharge Physical Exam: Vitals: 98, 150/85, 105 (90's-100's) regular, RR 14, Sat% 98RA General: Alert, orientedx3, no acute distress, lying semi-flat in bed HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: It was difficult to auscultate to her back comfortably given her neurological condition.
no wheezes heard but fine insp crackles at the right base and axilla.
CV: Tachycardic with regular rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly.
Surgical scar midline inferior to umbilicus with smaller RUQ scars Skin: Hickman catheter removed, no tenderness or erythema Extremities: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus, as clinically questioned.
Extensive loculated right pleural fluid, with multiple foci of nodular pleural enhancement, concerning for malignant pleural disease.
Consolidation of the right middle and right lower lobes, with markedly heterogeneous attenuation of the lung parenchyma including multiple areas of non-enhancement which appear mass-like, possibly reflecting the presence of necrotic metastases (suggested by the presence of additional bilateral pulmonary nodules) versus necrotizing pneumonia, or a combination of the above.
Multiple low-attenuation liver lesions, necrotic mediastinal lymph nodes and numerous additional pulmonary nodules, all concerning for additional sites of metastatic disease.
CXR [**2128-8-10**]: Large right-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis, cannot exclude developing infectious infiltrate, aerated right and left lung are within normal limits, levoconcave scoliosis .
There is a very small circumferential, predominantly anterior pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade (based on absence of respiratory variation of MV/TV inflow as RV could not be well visualized).
IMPRESSION: Very poor technical quality.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
Moderate-to-large right-sided pleural effusion has increased compared to the prior exam.
There is no new consolidation.
The cardiac silhouette cannot be evaluated in the setting of large right pleural effusion.
There is no overt edema.
Dextroconvex scoliosis of the thoracic spine noted.
IMPRESSION: Increased moderate partially-loculated right pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 52 year old woman with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and colon cancer previously treated with chemo, surgery, radiotherapy, followed by progression of disease to lung/liver presented with sub-acute right chest pleuritic pain and dyspsnea, most likely due to her poor lung condition.
Most likely secondary to pain/discomfort though was mildly fluid responsive so may in part be due to hypovolemia.
She was admitted to ICU for further evaluation of her tachycardia.
CT showed no pericardial effusion.
TTE was obtained to evaluate compressive physiology, however the images were of poor quality and some details were not possible to evaluate.
TTE showed most likely a normal ejection fraction with no evidence of tamponade.
# Chest pain: Given location and pleuritic nature, most likely due to pleural effusion.
No leukocytosis/fever or increased cough to confirm infected.
EKG with ST abnormalities and no prior for comparison.
She was monitored on telemetry and notable only for tachycardia to 110s.
Given lack of findings of Pneumonia on CTA, antibiotics that were started in the ED were discontinued.
# Dyspnea: likely due to pleural effusion.
Given the normal oxygen saturation on room air and loculated fluid collection and predominating tumor burden in her Right lung (likely unamenable to re-expansion) thoracentesis was deferred as unlikely to help her.
# Malignancy: No outside hospital records with the patient.
We received some reports which stated that she has metastatic colon cancer (KRAS mutation positive) and that she was for hospice care.
She had no signs of active bleeding.
Hct and Hgb was trended daily and labs sent for vitamin B12, folate and iron studies which revealed normal B12 and folate, however Iron studies were suggestive of Anemia of chronic disease, most likely due to her malignancy.
# Paralysis: unclear underlying disorder but chronic.
# Hypertension: currently well controlled, continued her home anti-hypertensive medication.
# Hyperlipidemia: On simvastatin.
5. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: metastatic colon cancer  Secondary diagnoses: Tachycardia hypertension hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] because of right sided body pain (chest and belly) and difficulty breathing.
Your pain was well controlled with tylenol and oxycodone.
CT scan of your chest in concern of a clot in your lung vessels.
However, your CT scan did show evidence of your known cancer.
