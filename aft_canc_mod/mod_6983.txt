As noted, the patient has an extensive medical history which dates back to [**2115**], when she was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease status post CHOP XRT therapy complicated by histoplasmosis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary fibrosis and bronchiectasis, with subsequent complications of tuberculosis in [**2121**] and aspergillosis in [**2122**], for which she required a left pneumonectomy.
The patient had been functioning fairly well until [**2131-8-19**], when she was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 190**] for pulmonary complications.
This hospital course was complicated by a labile fluid status, labile potassium levels ranging between 3.0 to 7.9 with subsequent associated arrhythmias, constipation, and also during this hospitalization she had tracheostomy pain secondary to a posterior tracheal ulcer, which was felt to be an early tracheoesophageal fistula.
Upon arrival to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient reports feeling well, and is without complaints.
Status post left pneumonectomy secondary to aspergillosis in [**2122**] 3.
Status post pseudomonas pneumonia in spring of [**2130**] 6.
Status post tuberculosis in [**2121**] 7.
Biventricular heart failure with cor pulmonale and cardiomyopathy secondary to tachycardia, with an ejection fraction of 20% 8.
History of supraventricular tachycardia when hyperkalemic, and junctional bradycardia with hypokalemic 9.
Hyponatremia 10.
History of anxiety and depression  ALLERGIES:  Sulfa, oxacillin, calcium channel blockers, questionable cephalosporin allergy  SOCIAL HISTORY:  Reformed tobacco smoker, currently at [**Hospital3 **] Center  FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory  MEDICATIONS: 1.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, oropharynx clear, no lymphadenopathy, tracheostomy stoma with no erythema, no exudate.
Cardiovascular:  S1, S2, S4, III/VI holosystolic murmur heard throughout precordium, with a left ventricular heave.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds, jejunostomy tube in place, again no erythema or exudate.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing; trace edema bilaterally, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
Neurologic:  No focal deficits, moving all extremities, speech as above.
On day number two of hospital stay, the patient underwent a fiberoptic and rigid bronchoscopy with findings of mild stenosis at the tracheostomy stoma site.
During this procedure, the [**Last Name (un) 295**] tracheostomy was removed and findings revealed that the site of the previous tracheal ulceration on the posterior wall is healed but with flaccid mucosa over the lower third.
There were no complications.
Cardiac:  The patient has a history of biventricular heart failure with a baseline ejection fraction of 20%.
The patient also had a previous hospitalization with a history of labile fluid balance, though has been currently stable on a regimen at [**Hospital1 **].
Gastrointestinal:  The patient has a history of constipation leading to hyperkalemia.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition: a.  Potassium:  The patient has a history of fluctuating potassium levels.
Psychiatry:  The patient has a history of anxiety and depression.
Lines:  The patient has a left PICC line that is intact, and a jejunostomy tube also, with no exudate or erythema.
Status post tracheal ulcer with healed ulcer complicated by flaccid mucosa 3.
Status post multiple pulmonary insults 5.
Biventricular heart failure 6.
