Admission Date:  [**2195-1-28**]     Discharge Date:  [**2195-2-2**]   Service:  CARDIAC CRITICAL CARE UNIT  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84 year-old white female with multiple medical problems including hypertension, severe peripheral vascular disease, awaiting revascularization recently admitted to NABH for preoperative catheterization, which was complicated by severe groin bleeding.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] with hypertension and severe pain.
The patient had a right lower extremity ulcer.
She recently underwent peripheral vascular workup including noninvasive studies, which revealed right and left superficial femoral artery occlusion with collateralization on the left.
The patient had a preoperative workup.
By report the catheterization from left groin revealed 90% mid left anterior descending coronary artery lesion at D1 bifurcation and 90 to 95% proximal left circumflex occlusion with 40% posterior descending coronary artery.
Postoperative course was complicated by groin hematoma and bleeding requiring 4 units of packed red blood cells and emergent operative care by vascular surgery.
Postoperatively, the patient experienced severe pain and received morphine and Fentanyl.
The patient had also runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
On her pain management the patient became very somnolent, disoriented.
She had altered mental status so she underwent a head CT, which was negative.
On [**1-26**] the patient was more awake and oriented as her pain medication was tapered off, but experienced elevated blood pressures as high as 240/50.
Severe peripheral vascular disease.
History of atrial fibrillation.
Congestive heart failure question 40% EF.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
ALLERGIES:  Codeine and beta blocker, causing bronchospasm in the past, but tolerating beta blocker recently.
Generally, elderly female, frail, hard of hearing, no acute distress.
Heart regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Left lower quadrant site of prior surgical drains with surrounding ecchymosis.
Extremities no edema, RLE markedly tender to manipulation, large left groin hematoma with previously marked origins.
Left groin staples in place, dried blood surrounding, but otherwise clean and dry.
Chest x-ray borderline cardiomegaly, left hemidiaphragm obscurations, small pleural effusion on left side.
IMPRESSION/PLAN:  The patient is an 84 year-old female, labile hypertension, severe peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure with a recent catheterization with left anterior descending coronary artery and left circumflex stenosis with catheterization complicated by groin hematoma requiring operative repair, transferred with hypertension and transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for intervention of her coronary arteries.
Coronary artery disease:  The patient's left anterior descending coronary artery and left circumflex stenosis on catheterization [**1-22**], the patient will get cardiac intervention via Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] prior to lower extremity revascularization.
Hypertension/heart rate:  Elevated blood pressure on po Lasix.
Continue [**Last Name (un) **], continue Procardia and Clonidine.
EP:  Patient run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia by report.
Must also consider left lower extremity ulcer, large groin hematoma as possible source of infection.
Will defer starting antibiotics for now pending chest x-rays and cultures and monitoring temperature.
We will follow up with this and continue wet to dry dressing changes for a right lower extremity ulcer.
Neurological:  Possible delirium secondary to stress of acute illness versus pain.
Will follow mental status and give low dose morphine and/or Percocet for pain control.
The patient had stent placed in her left circumflex successfully.
The patient was placed on beta blocker and has been doing well with no bronchospasm or issues due to allergies.
The patient did have a temperature spike to just above 101 degrees Fahrenheit, but has continued to remain afebrile since then.
The patient did have a seven day course of Levaquin for a urinary tract infection.
The patient did have ABIs done prior to discharge, which the impression was significant right superficial femoral artery and bilateral tibial disease and probable right superficial femoral artery occlusion.
The patient had markedly decreased ABI index.
Status post cardiac catheterization the patient did have a hematoma at the site of catheterization.
On discharge there was no oozing or bruit heard.
The hematoma has not enlarged.
The patient on the day of discharge is having no issues, no shortness of breath, chest pain or pain in her lower extremities.
The patient will also be followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for possible femoral popliteal bypass in the future.
