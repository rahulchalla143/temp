History of Present Illness: History obtained through medical records and patient who is deemed a pleasant but limited historian secondary to dementia.
The patient is an 80 year old male with a history of mild dementia, CML on gleevec, COPD, HTN,HL, CHF EF 40% with known severe 3 vessel CAD s/p NSTEMI and cath at [**Hospital3 17921**] Center in [**9-5**] (see below) who was transferred from Lakes [**Hospital 12018**] Hospital on [**2139-1-13**] for further cardiac evaluation for possible CABG.
The patient was admitted to Lakes Regional on [**2139-1-12**] from cardiac rehab where the nurses noted on telemetry that he had asymptomatic bradycardia to the 30s with a 3 second pause on [**2139-1-9**] at cardiac rehab and prolonged PR interval consistent with 1st degree AV block.
He denied any lightheadedness, dizziness, presyncope or syncope.
He had no chest pain, radiating pain to the jaw/back/left arm and denied any symptoms of heart failure although he has bilateral lower extremity edema noted over the past year which appears slightly improved per the patient.
On admission, he was monitored on telemetry where his lopressor was discontinued with no further events/interventions.
On transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**1-13**], the patient denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND.
He has had stable (slightly improved) bilateral lower extremity edema.

FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS  There has been interval removal of the endotracheal tube, NG tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, and left chest tube.
No pneumothorax is identified.
Slight increase in bibasilar linear atelectasis.
New small bilateral pleural effusions are also noted.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumothorax.
New bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.
No thrombus in the LAA.
Dynamic interatrial septum.
Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum at rest.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity.
AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Mildly dilated aortic arch.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Mildly dilated descending aorta.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Image quality was suboptimald - poor esophageal contact.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded, but overall function appears normal in transgastric views.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
The aortic root, ascending and descending aorta are mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Mitral regurgitation appears trace.
[**Location (un) **] PHYSICIAN:     Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent routine preoperative evaluation which included echocardiogram, pulmonary function test and carotid non-invasive studies.
Echocardiogram showed no aortic valve disease with only physiologic mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary function testing showed normal lung function while carotid ultrasound found no significant disease of the internal carotid arteries.
Given history of second degree AV block/bradycardia, beta blockade continued to be withheld.
He remained bradycardic with a heart rate in the 40-50's.
He remained asymptomatic and stable on medical therapy, and eventually cleared for surgery.
Post-operatively he also had intermittent atrial fibrillation which was treated with amiodarone and beta blockade.
Over the next several days he continued to make steady progress while working with physical therapy for strength and mobility.
