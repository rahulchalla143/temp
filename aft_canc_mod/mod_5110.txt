His recent health has been complicated by multiple episodes of hepatic encephalopathy, portal venous thrombosis, esophageal varices, ascites, portal HTN requiring admission.
Notably, the patient has a left thyroid nodule that was biopsied and suggestive of papillary carcinoma being followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5182**] (please refer to his OMR notes for details) and a cardiac evaluation in [**2171-3-28**], that cleared him for potential liver transplantation.
DM-insulin dependent -> very labile in setting of ESLD and followed at [**Last Name (un) **] with recent FSG's varrying from 2 to 300.
ESLD awaiting [**Last Name (un) **]: [**1-29**] hep B, hepatic encephalopathy and recurrent ascites, esophageal varices (grade III [**2168**]),portal hypertension and known portal vein thrombosis not on anticoagulation.
History of tuberculosis s/p 6 months INH 4.
HTN 6.
History of E. Coli septicemia in [**12-1**] 7.
Hx of Acute renal failure thought [**1-29**] Hepsera in [**3-4**] 8.
Family History: No family history of hepatocellular carcinoma or cirrhosis.

Per the operative report, the arterial anastomosis was donor common hepatic artery to recipient common hepatic artery anastomosis created end-to- end fashion with several areas  that required repair sutures for hemostasis after unclamping.
Please refer to operative note for complete details.
There were low left hepatic arterial resistive indices and borderline right hepatic arterial resistive indices with normal main hepatic arterial indices.
A right hepatic subcapsular hematoma was noted measuring 3.6 x 2.4 cm.
LFTs increased and a repeat duplex was done on [**5-26**] showing patent venous vasculature.
The hepatic artery was patent with low resistive indices, decreased in the main hepatic artery.
There was normal upstroke in the main hepatic artery with delayed and blunted upstroke in the left and right hepatic artery, and high diastolic flow.
This raised concern for anastamotic stenosis.
Given elevated LFTs and duplex studies, a CTA was done to evaluate the vasculature.
This showed compromised arterial flow to the liver due to arterial stenosis.
He had required an insulin drip for hyperglycemia due to steroids.
Insulin was switched back to the patients home regimen of 75/25 qam and pre supper on the day of [**Hospital1 **] to facilitate home management given h/o hypoglycemic episodes with insulin.
