He presented with biliary obstruction and is transferred from an OSH after a failed ERCP attempt with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
The wire could be seen in the duodenum fluroscopically but could not be reached by endoscope due to diffuse duodenal edema and tumor growth.
He has been having nausea and vomiting non-bilious, non bloody.
Of note the patient reports that he was diagnosed with a blood clot in his L leg but the left leg "blew up" overnight and is worse.
He reports a cold R foot with increasing pain and numbness, worse over the past 24 hours which he attributes to the ambulance ride.

No acute changes.
CT [**2200-1-31**] Locally advanced pancreatic malignancy with obstruction of the CBD, liver metastases and regional adneopathy.
ERCP [**2200-1-31**] Friable mass in the second portion of the duodenum.
Stricture with conscioius villing.
Pancreatic duct accesses but the CBD could not be accessed.
Extensive pulmonary embolism involving the right main, lobar and segmental Preliminary Reportarteries of the right lower lobe and segmental arteries of the left lower Preliminary Reportlobe.
No right heart strain.
Multifocal consolidation in both lungs, predominantly involving both upper Preliminary Reportlobes and the right middle lobe, concerning for multifocal pneumonia.
Preliminary ReportBilateral small pleural effusions.
Known pancreatic malignancy, is not well assessed in this study.
Metastatic disease in the Preliminary Reportabdomen including multifocal liver metastasis, enlarged Preliminary Reportgastrohepatic/retroperitoneal adenopathy, and thickened left adrenal gland.
Diffuse thickening of the gastric and colonic walls could be reactive Preliminary Reportchanges versus third spacing.
Moderate amount of abdominal ascites.
Extensive atherosclerotic disease of the iliac arteries.
Preliminary ReportRIGHT: Long segment occlusion of the right external iliac and the common Preliminary Reportfemoral artery, with reconstitution at the level of distal CFA.
Multifocal Preliminary Reportstenosis of the right SFA and popliteal arteries, with absent flow in the Preliminary Reportright anterior tibial and peroneal at the distal third of the leg.
Preliminary ReportLEFT: Multiple areas of high-grade stenosis and short segment near-complete Preliminary Reportocclusion of the left external iliac artery, with multiple areas of high-grade Preliminary Reportstenosis in the femoral, popliteal arteries of the left lower extremity.
Preliminary ReportPatent posterior tibials bilaterally.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No clear evidence of RV strain.
Brief Hospital Course: Brief Course: Pt is a 56 year old male with history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, tobacco abuse, previous alcohol abuse, LLE DVT, and recently diagnosed metastatic stage 4 pancreatic cancer with gastric outlet/biliary obstruction who presented s/p ERCP at [**Hospital1 18**] for duodenal/biliary stent placement, found to have bilateral PE's, now transferred to the medical ICU with acute hypotension and dyspnea on exertion/hypoxemia.
# Hypotension: Likely multifactorial from bilateral PE's, possible hypovolemia, and concern for developing sepsis.
Pt had CTA torso on the medical floors prior to transfer to the ICU, and was found to have bilateral PE's.
TTE showed no evidence of right heart strain.
He had a mild drop in hematocrit, but no obvious signs of bleeding, and the Hct on recheck was stable.
# Right foot/toe ischemia and peripheral vascular disease: Currently no plans for intervention.
CTA suggests chronic problem with intermittent ischemia.
He was given pain medication as needed for vomfort.
# Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: Differential includes hyperalimentation (TPN was started previously?)
vs. diarrhea vs. pancreatic fisuli (alkali lossfrom pancreas).
Most likely due to his pancreatic cancer and known fisultas/obstructions.
No more labs were checked given goals of care.
# Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer: Complicated by biliary/duodenal obstruction with difficult to intervent anatomy.
As above, given goals of care discussion, he was given morphine for pain control.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: 1. metastatic pancreatic cancer 2. pulmonary emboli   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were found to have pulmonary emboli, and possible infection in your lungs.
Please start the following medications: - Morphine IR 30mg orally every 4 hours as needed for pain - Tylenol as needed for pain or fevers - Ondansetron 4mg IV or ODT as needed for nausea every 8 hours  Followup Instructions: Please follow-up with the hospice care team.
