Bibasilar opacification, likely edema and atelectasis.
CT chest [**2193-6-20**]: No pulmonary embolism.
Moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Moderate bilateral ground glass opacity likely represents pulmonary edema.
Stercoral colitis is suspected given the presence of a large amount of rectal stool.
The apparent trace pneumobilia may instead represent intraperitoneal air dissecting along portal veins.
Minimal biliary air in the gallbladder and biliary tree is nonspecific and may the sequelae of prior instrumentation such ERCP/sphinterotomy.
No free air.
Comminuted fracture of the left ilium with extension to the superior pubic ramus and acetabulum.
Acetabular component has intra-articular extension without femoral head involvement or dislocation.
Changes of ankylosing spondylitis with fusion of the right sacroiliac joint and vertebral body.
Diffusely abnormal marrow with sclerosis and atrophic kidneys consistent renal osteodystrophy.
Osseous sequelae of myeloproliferative disease are also superimposed.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with subsegmental atelectasis.
Mild fusiform aneurysmal dilatation of the abdominal aorta just proximal to the bifurcation measuring 2.2 cm  CXR [**2193-6-26**] In comparison with study of [**6-20**], the degree of bilateral opacification may be slightly less prominent.
Substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists.
Brief Hospital Course: 87 year old M with ESRD on HD (T/Th/Sa), renal osteodystrophy, diastolic CHF, severe aortic stenosis, myelodysplastic syndrome, who presented from [**Hospital3 2558**] on [**2193-6-20**] with dyspnea [**12-20**] to pulmonary edema now resolved but with acute/subacute fractures of the left acetabulum and found to have free air which is thought to be [**12-20**] stercoral ulcer.
Active Issues: # Acute Respiratory Distress: Pt was hypoxic on admission requiring O2 therapy secondary to pulmonary edema.
[**Name2 (NI) **] evidence of PNA or PE on CT scan.
Pt appeared hypervolemic and was approximately 3kg above last dry wt.
Pt respiratory symptoms improved after he received emergent ultrafiltration.
Since resolution of acute dyspneic event pt has been asymptomatic and tolerating 2L of O2 with Pox sats > 95.
CXR was obtained which did not show evidence of recurrent pulmonary edema.
Patient reported a fall 1 week prior with minimal pain.
However given his sever AS and multiple poor outcome comorbidites it was felt that he would survive this type of high risk surgery and it was deferred.
#Stercoral ulcer-patient had evidence of stercoral ulcer on his CT abdomen with some air surrounding his portal system, however his abdominal exam was unremarkable and he had no abdominal pain.
The ulcer is thought to be secondary to hard stools.
He understands that his multiple medical problems put him at risk for recurrent hospitalizations.
Chronic Issues: .
#Aortic Stenosis: Severe calcific AS with valve area 0.8-1.0cm2.
Current worsening of respiratory status could be secondary to worsening aortic stenosis, however TTE showed stable severe AS.
Mild calcific mitral stenosis.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Pulmonary edema in setting of diastolic CHF is likely cause of his respiratory distress.
Monitor weights daily and notify PCP if there is change in weight greater than 2-3lbs.
Pt is very sensitive to fluid overload and should have his fluid balance monitored to prevent future episodes of volume overload.
#Leg Ulcer: Pt with healing ulcer on left lateral shin.
S/p debridement and treatment for surperimposed cellulitis on a previous admission and course of Augmentin completed on last admission [**Date range (1) **].
These include: Commercial wound cleanser or normal saline to irrigate/cleanse all open wounds.
#MDS/Elevated WBC count: Pt has h/o of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] and has recently developed MDS.
He also has chronically elevated WBC which is thought to be due to MDS.
Pt has been afebrile and does not appear to have an infection.
#BPH: Pt denies urinary symptoms currently.
#HTN: Pt was not hypertensive on this admission.
Prior to hypoglycemia on previous admission he had no history of diabetes and not currently on meds known to cause hypoglycemia.
Transitional Issues: -Patient noted to have elevated TSH.
-Pt will need to have his acetabular fx followed up by orthopedics in 2 weeks.

Mirtazapine 15 mg PO HS   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: dyspnea Pulmonary Edema Left acetabular fracture ESRD stercoral ulcer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You came to the hospital because you were having difficulty breathing.
We found that you had accumlated fluid in your lungs which we were able to improve with ultrafiltration and hemodialysis.
We also found that you had a fracture of your left hip which after discussion with the orthopedic team it was determined that surgery was not a good option given your poor condition and multiple medical problems.
