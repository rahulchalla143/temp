Admission Date:  [**2189-9-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2189-9-25**]  Date of Birth:   [**2154-12-25**]       Sex:  F  Service:  GYN ONC  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 34-year-old gravida 2, para 2, with a history of recurrent adenocarcinoma of the cervix, Stage IB, who presents with severe left hip pain that radiates to the thigh and buttocks.
PAST ONCOLOGICAL HISTORY:  On [**2188-3-24**], the patient underwent a radical hysterectomy, bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy, and bilateral ovarian transposition for Stage IB adenocarcinoma of the cervix.
In [**2189-1-29**], the patient developed lower left pelvic pain radiating to the left leg.
Work-up with an MRI demonstrated soft tissue mass near the left vaginal apex.
The patient had multiple vaginal biopsies under anesthesia which were not diagnostic.
On [**2189-4-24**], the patient had transvaginal ultrasound needle aspiration which was positive for carcinoma.
At this time, she was diagnosed with recurrent Stage IB cervical cancer.
She had good symptomatic relief of her pain after initiating the therapy.
The patient began having recurrent pain approximately two weeks later which has been progressively worsening.
The pain became debilitating the night before admission.
The pain is sharp, stabbing and continuous.
It begins in the left hip and radiates along the anterior aspect of the thigh and lateral buttocks.
The pain is now exacerbated with activity.
Prior to exacerbation of this pain it had been fairly well controlled with Motrin and Klonopin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Stage IB adenocarcinoma of the cervix.
EXAM:  The patient was afebrile at 98, blood pressure 122/80, respiratory rate 18, pulse 84.
In general, she was in no acute distress.
There was some diffuse tenderness in the left lower quadrant and along the left lateral hip.
There were no obvious masses or nodules.
Her CT scan from [**2189-8-18**] revealed soft tissue stranding, but no evidence of recurrence.
In summary, the patient is a 34-year-old gravida 2, para 2, with a history of recurrent Stage IB adenocarcinoma of the cervix, now presenting with debilitating left hip and leg pain.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) LEG PAIN:  As noted, the patient was admitted for pain control.
On hospital day #3, the patient underwent an MRI which demonstrated left side tissue mass, unchanged from CT scan of [**2189-7-29**].
There was also noted to be a new left hydronephrosis.
They recommended fine cuts through the LS spine to see if there was any nerve impingement.
Repeat MRI again demonstrated no evidence of disease along the nerves.
She was noted to have oxygen desaturation to the 80s.
She was also noted to be hypotensive and tachycardic.
An EKG was obtained that showed sinus tachycardia.
The pain service and anesthesia were called to immediately see the patient.
This biopsy was negative for malignancy.
Additionally, on hospital day #17, the patient complained of myotonic jerks upon falling asleep.
2) LEFT HYDRONEPHROSIS/LEFT URETERAL OBSTRUCTION:  Secondary to findings of left hydronephrosis on MRI, a urology consult was obtained.
I should mention that it was unclear whether the hydronephrosis was caused by tumor versus radiation fibrosis.
