Admission Date:  [**2165-7-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2165-7-16**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: 83 y/o M discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-9**] (admitted from [**Date range (1) 66815**] for hypoxic resp failure), MMP including CAD s/p CABG, afib, HTN, Parkinson's and chronic aspiration with admits in recent past for GIB and PNA.
He grew [**Month/Year (2) **] [**5-21**] blood cx on [**7-2**] and pseudomonas and MRSA in his sputum [**7-5**], and linezolid and zosyn were started with plan to treat until [**7-17**] and [**7-16**] respectively.
PICC was pulled, TTE showed no vegetations.
In addition to his respiratory and ID issues, he had episodes of RVR for which metoprolol was titrated up.
No fevers or other complaints were not noted.
AFib on coumadin  (had been evaluated by cardiologist in [**12-22**], and it was decided not to place him on coumadin given history of multiple falls, but to rate control him with metoprolol.
CAD s/p CABG [**2157**], 4 coronary vein grafts 5. frequent falls 6.
Hyperlipidemia 8.
Myelodysplastic syndrome 9.
Urinary obstruction (?BPH) 10.
HTN 11.
Antral gastritis 12. malignant melanoma right ear excised 13. multiple polyps (from ascending, transverse and sigmoid colons - hyperplastic tubulovillous adenomas) seen on colonoscopy [**3-/2164**] 14.
Restrictive lung disease [**3-21**] to asbestos exposure 15. chronic vit B12 deficiency 16.
Neck somewhat stiff, but no Brudzinsky's.
Lungs: anterior with rhonchi, posterior with poor air movement, crackles throughout, worse at the bases, and scattered wheezes CV: tachycardic, no appreciated m/r/g Abd: soft, very thin, nd.
[**4-21**] hip flexors/biceps.
There is interval improvement in diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities consistent with improving mild pulmonary edema.
Additionally, peripheral opacities are seen in both lungs, which could represent multifocal pneumonia or asymmetric pulmonary edema, and also are improving in the interval.
Small bilateral effusions persist.
No pneumothorax is seen.
Improving peripheral airspace opacities likely representing multifocal pneumonia rather than asymmetric pulmonary edema.
Improving mild pulmonary edema.

# Aspiration/hypoxia: Likely multifactorial, aspiration event vs mucus plug / secretions.
Lung function compromised by recent MRSA PNA + now growing Pseudomonas, ?
Pseudomonal superinfection contributing.
- d/ced PICC and sent tip for Cx [**7-4**] showing no growth - continue Linezolid for 2 weeks, started [**7-4**] - source of [**Name (NI) **] unclear, urine cultures have been negative.
# Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: On BB as outpt.
At last admission, had repeated episodes of RVR with afib.
- will avoid sotalol as outpatient cardiologist suggested that because of his CAD, Class Ic agents are contraindicated in this clinical setting.
# CAD: stable without active ischemia - BB, ASA, statin .
# H/O GIB: In setting of supratherapeutic INR.
Currently stable with no recurrent evetns.
# Parkinson Dz: c/b chronic aspiration - Sinemet increased to QID from TID at last hospitalization.
# Sacral Decub and Heel Ulcers: wound care and OOB to chair when possible.
# Metabolic Alkylosis - Volume depleted, corrected with IVF hydration.
# Code Status: DNR but not DNI.
