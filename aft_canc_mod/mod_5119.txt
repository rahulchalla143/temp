The suprapatellar effusion is moderate.
IMPRESSION: Right total knee replacement with no complications.
There is an endotracheal tube in place as well as an orogastric tube.
There is minimal mucosal thickening of the right frontoethmoidal recess.
There is moderate mucosal thickening of the left sphenoid air cell and minimal mucosal thickening of the right sphenoid air cell.
Minimal mucosal thickening with small polypoid lesions is seen within the maxillary sinuses bilaterally.
The left OMU is somewhat narrowed but still patent.
Nasal septum is deviated to the right with a right-sided nasal septal spur.
There are no areas of bony destruction.
No suspicious bony abnormalities are seen.
IMPRESSION: Mucosal changes of the paranasal sinuses as described above in the setting of orogastric and endotracheal tubes.
No areas of bony destruction.
[**2105-12-2**] CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST [**2105-12-2**]:  IMPRESSION:  1) Circumferential complex right pleural disease likely due to organizing phase of empyema.
No large loculated collections.
2) Bibasilar consolidation likely due to provided history of pneumonia.
High attenuation focus within left basilar consolidation may be due to aspirated barium if the patient has received oral contrast at the outside hospital.
3) Small left pleural effusion and trace ascites.
5) Distended loops of bowel within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen on scout image incompletely evaluated.
Consider dedicated abdominal radiograph if warranted clinically.
6) Incompletely imaged distended gallbladder.
MRI OF THE TOTAL SPINE  HISTORY: 63-year-old man with strep pneumonia, septic arthritis, and empyema who is persistently febrile; assess for epidural abscess.
MR OF THE CERVICAL SPINE:  TECHNIQUE: Sagittal pre-gado T1, post-gado T1 with and without fat sat, T2, STIR; axial T2-weighted images of the cervical spine were obtained as part of the total spine protocol.
No discrete fluid collections are identified concerning for abscesses.
There is minimal T2 hyperintensity and enhancement of the right side of the C2 vertebral body but without destructive changes of the adjacent endplates or signal abnormalities of the C2/3 disc.
There is possible T1 hyperintensity in this region on the pre-gado images.
These findings likely represent a hemangioma.
The remainder of the visualized bone marrow signal is normal with no loss of vertebral body heights.
At C3/4, there are degenerative changes of the right uncovertebral and facet joints causing mild right foraminal stenosis.
At C4/5, there are degenerative changes of the right facet and uncovertebral joints as well as thickening of the ligamentum flavum which is causing moderate right foraminal stenosis.
At C5/6, there is a disc osteophyte complex eccentric to the right and thickening of the ligamentum flavum, the combination of which is causing mild canal stenosis but no foraminal stenoses.
No paraspinal soft tissue abnormalities are seen.
MR OF THE THORACIC SPINE:  TECHNIQUE: Sagittal pre-gado T1, post-gado T1 with and without fat sat, T2, STIR; axial T2-weighted images of the thoracic spine were obtained as part of a total spine protocol.
The visualized bone marrow signal is normal with no loss of vertebral body heights or intervertebral disc space heights.
At T2/3, T5/6, T6/7, T8/9, and T9/10, there are small disc protrusions which are not contacting the ventral cord.
There are also loculated fluid collections within the right pleural space and consolidation of the right lower lobe with apparent bronchiectasis.
Edema and enhancement of the retropharyngeal/prevertebral soft tissues extending from the skull base to the C3 level without discrete fluid collections consistent with cellulitis/phlegmon.
No evidence of spondylodiscitis or epidural abscesses.
Degenerative changes of the cervical spine causing mild canal stenosis at the C5/6 level.
Degenerative changes of the lumbar spine causing mild canal stenosis at the L4/5 level.
Loculated fluid collections within the right pleural space with a chest tube in place.
There is also consolidation in the right lower lobe with apparent bronchiectasis.
[**2105-12-2**] LENIs IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes and global systolic function.
[**2105-12-3**] CT HEAD  IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
RETROPHARYNGEAL COLLECTION NOS: The initial imaging studies were concerning for a retropharyngeal collection, but after repeat imaging and ENT consultation this was not felt to be present.
DELIRIUM: Multifactorial including infection and hospitalization, slowly improving with suppotive care and minimizing the use of centrally acting medications.
This was likely due to BB withdrawal and acute illness .
ANEMIA:  Secondary to blood loss from surgery and malignancy (Ferritin > 1000) .
He was treated with IVIG on [**12-4**], and will be due for a second in early [**2105-12-29**].
HYPERTENSION: Well controlled, HCTZ stopped, Toprol started for SVT and can be titrated up if there is the blood pressure is not well controlled.
DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE II: FSBS well controlled on Lantus and ISS .
