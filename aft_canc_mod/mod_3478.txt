[**Name (NI) **] wife reports that 2-3 weeks ago, patient developed necrotic areas on his toes and he was started on gabapentin and bacitracin ointment.
Shortly after that he developed a cough productive of yellow, nonbloody sputum.
Additional symptoms include progressive fatigue, weakness, multiple falls, decreased PO intake, and confusion.
Then one day prior to admission, patient was noted to have subjective fever and worsening of his feet infections and he was recommended to come to the ED.
While in the ED, he became hypotensive to 70/28, febrile to 103.4, and tachycardic to 104.
A CXR demonstrated right lower lobe infiltrate.

bilateral dry necrotic toes without tenderness.
Left great toe and medial 2nd toe; right 2nd toe with necrotic toes.
diminished light touch sensation in lower extremities bilaterally.
cool lower extremities bilaterally.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).
PULMONARY EDEMA VERSUS VOLUME OVERLOAD.
Asbestos exposure .
Chronic or subacute fracture of the distal aspect of the first proximal phalanx on the left.
No specific radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis.
MR would be more sensitive for detection of osteomyelitis if clinically indicated.
On the left, the only Doppler tracing that was obtained with a monophasic left femoral tracing.
IMPRESSION:  There is a severe flow deficit to both lower extremities from the level of the femorals distally.
This is likely secondary to aortoiliac occlusive disease.
[**10-6**] TEE: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No ASD or intracardiac thrombus seen.
There is edema in the dorsal lateral soft tissues.
There is no abnormal signal within the osseous structures to suggest osteomyelitis.
There is no joint effusion.
There is degenerative change of the first MTP joint.
IMPRESSION:  Dorsolateral soft tissue edema of left foot without evidence of osteomyelitis.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm with extensive atherosclerosis is present in the entire vasculature of the abdomen and the lower extremities.
There is an aortobifemoral graft with complete occlusion of left limb as well as occluded and retrograde filling of the left internal and external iliac arteries.
Fem-fem graft with luminal thrombus causing almost 30% narrowing of the graft with extensive atherosclerosis and calcific plaque causing significant attenuation of the vasculature of the lower extremities as described above.
Atrophic small kidneys with multiple cysts in keeping with the known diagnosis of chronic renal failure.
Ventral abdominal hernia with loops of bowel without definite evidence of bowel obstruction.
[**2135-10-17**] EGD: Impression: Erosions in the gastroesophageal junction compatible with esophagitis; Abnormal mucosa in the stomach; Erythema in the duodenum compatible with duodenitis; Protruding lesion vs. thickened fold found near papilla in 2nd portion of duodenum.
Additional notes: GI bleeding likely secondary to erosive esophagitis at GE junction.
Abnormal appearing polypoid lesion vs. thickened fold at papilla could not be adequate visualized.
Next step would be evaluation with side-viewing scope and EUS if patient/family wish to pursue workup.
Benefit of anticoagulation needs to be weighed against risk of re-bleeding given esophagitis.
18 mm nodule in the left lung apex is concerning for possible lung cancer and less likely apical scar.
18 mm rounded lesion at the right lung base most likely represents rounded atelectasis; however, this finding, and the adjacent pleural thickening, can also be evaluated at the time of the recommended PET CT to exclude neoplasm.
Resolving posterior segment right upper lobe and superior segment right lower lobe pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonia.
Increased peritoneal fluid since the [**2135-10-11**] examination.
Extensive atherosclerotic disease within the imaged aorta and coronary arteries.
No intraluminal thrombus identified.
IMPRESSION: No right upper extremity DVT identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 77-year-old gentleman with ESRD, PVD, DM, and CAD with RLL pneumonia and necrotic toes.
Transferred on [**2135-10-4**] from OSH w/ RLL PNA and sepsis.
He was also evluated for revascularization options for ischemic digits in his lower extremities from his PVD.
A TEE showed complex atheroma in his aorta and he was started on heparin gtt and coumadin.
On [**10-17**] he became hypotensive to SBP 70s-80s associated with an episode of coffee ground emesis and guaiac positive stool and he was transferred to the MICU.
An upper endoscopy showed erosive esophagitis at the GE junction but no brisk bleeding.
# SEPSIS Patient met clinical criteria for sepsis in MICU, with fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated lactate.
Patient was given a 14 day course of Vanc/Zosyn to cover both pneumonia and soft tissue infection, to which he responded well.
A LLE MRI was negative for evidence of osteomyelitis (although the study was somewhat limited due to lack of gadolinium).
He also received 5 days of stress dose steroids for concern of relative adrenal insufficiency.
# LE NECROTIC TOES Patient's exam was notable for non-dopplerable DP pulses and dry gangrene of toes on both feet.
He was evaluated by vascular surgery with a CT of his aorta/iliac/femoral vessels and then by a lower extremity angiogram.
There was no stentable lesion identified on angiogram.
Cardiology consult assessed the patient to be high risk for a high risk procedure, and it was decided not to pursue revascularization.
As he did not show evidence of having infection in his lower extremities, it was decided to continue wound care of his feet rather than to amputate at present.
# MOBILE ATHEROMA Mobile atheroma of the descending aorta was noted on TEE done to evaluate sources of possible thromboemboli to necrotic toes.
# DELIRIUM During the patient's MICU admission, he had waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status and at times became agitated.
# ESRD on PD Patient was followed by nephrology.
# DEPRESSION Patient had reportedly tried Paxil for depression as an outpatient.
# DM Although the patient is on oral agents at home, he was given insulin during his admission, especially since the 2.5% dialysis bath increased his insulin requirement.
He was switched back to his home regimen lantus 6u qhs, but because of decreased po intake was changed to half dose, 3u qhs.
# CARDIAC A. CAD The patient's PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**], who reported that the patient has had MI x 2 in the past, but is not aware of any PCI or CABG.
RHYTHM Patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation without rapid rhythm.
C. PUMP Echo demonstrated preserved EF, though the patient was felt to have chronic diastolic heart failure.
Although he was volume overloaded after being treated for sepsis in the MICU, he remained euvolemic after the extra volume was removed by dialysis.
# Upper GI bleed: Did not appear brisk.
# lung nodule and duodenal polyps - were observed on CT (see report), recommended for PCP to [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u as outpatient.
