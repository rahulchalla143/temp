He denies any cough, fever or weight loss.
He has chronic LLE edema, and notes new RLE edema in the last day.
His dyspnea worsened earlier today and he presented to [**Hospital3 2783**], a chest xray showed cardiomegaly and an echo was done which showed pericardial effusion.
On presentation to [**Hospital1 18**], he complains of shortness of breath, denies chest pain, back pain, abdominal pain, N/V.
Bedside ECHO by cardiology fellow showed large pericardian effusion (mostly posterior, 3.5cm).
Showed large anterior mediastinal mass, pericardial effusion.
He was in ED on an esmolol drip for a question of afib/dissection in setting of HTN, but ECG showed sinus tachycardia and APCs/VPCs.
A CTA confirmed the presence of a large pericardial effusion as well as an anterior mediastinal mass.
An echo showed right ventricular collapse and  less than 20% LVEF.
Cardiac catheterization was performed for pericardiocentesis; 1020 ccs of straw-colored fluid was drawn out, with an immediate relief of symptoms.
Past Medical History: - CAD s/p ant MI [**40**] year ago, given TPA with resultant hemorrhagic stroke, still has residual L sided weakness (LLE>LUE), bilateral DVT during the same admission, IVC filter placed, on coumadin.

TTE (Focused views) Done [**2139-4-11**] at 7:20:07 AM The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis in the basal anterior/anteroseptal walls and hypokinesis of the mid-distal anterior/anteroseptal walls (LVEF = 20%) Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe aortic stenosis is not suggested but mild aortic stenosis cannot be excluded.
Mild [1+] aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with mild [1+] mitral regurgitation.
There is a large, circumferentially, partially echo filled pericardial effusion extending 3cm inferolateral and lateral to the left ventricle and anterior to the right atrium, 1.5cm around the left ventricular apex and 1.0cm anterior to the right ventricle.
There is right ventricular diastolic invagination and eccentuated respiratory variation in the transmitral Doppler c/w tamponade physiology.
IMPRESSION: Large circumferential (likely hemorrhagic) pericardial effusion with right ventricular collapse c/w tamponade physiology.
Underlying severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
[**2139-4-11**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a large heterogeneous anterior mediastinal mass containing central coarse calcifications and areas of cystic change.
This mass abuts the aortic arch, right brachiocephalic, left common carotid, left subclavian artery and also abuts the main pulmonary artery.
There is no vascular invasion or compression.
There is a markedly large pericardial effusion.
There is no evidence of invasion into the lung parenchyma.
There is scalloping of the undersurface of the sternum adjacent to this mass suggesting osseous infiltration.
There is a small right pleural effusion with associated mild atelectasis.
No pulmonary nodules are identified.
There is additional soft tissue mass extending from the right paratracheal region out to the right hilum, likely representing a conglomerate of lymphadenopathy.
Limited views of the upper abdomen are unremarkable, aside from reflux of contrast into the hepatic veins, indicative of right heart failure.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
Moderate spurring is seen along the anterior portions of the vertebral bodies of the thoracic spine.
Large heterogeneous and cystic anterior mediastinal mass with  calcifications and associated large pericardial effusion.
Differential considerations include lymphoma, invasive thymoma, teratoma and less likely thyroid malignancy.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
Small right pleural effusion.
CT evidence of right heart failure.
CT LUNG/MEDIASTINAL BX Study Date of [**2139-4-14**] 2:32 PM PATHOLOGY [**2139-4-23**] I) Subpectoral nodule (A-B): Adenocarcinoma involving fibroadipose tissue.
II) Anterior mediastinal mass (C-D): Adenocarcinoma involving fibroadipose tissue and bone.
Test result (see below) do not clarify the diagnosis since the pattern does not show characteristics features of either colon or germ cell tumor.
META PHASES COUNTED: 15   ANALYZED: 15   SCORED: 10   BANDING: GTG INTERPRETATION: No cytogenetic aberrations were identified in metaphases analyzed from this specimen.
This normal result does not exclude a neoplastic proliferation.
COMMENTS:  Mosaicism and small chromosomes anomalies may not be detected using the standard methods employed.
ADDENDUM #2:  Stains for markers of embryonal carcinoma (PLAP and CD30) were negative.
TTE (Focused views) Done [**2139-4-16**] There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: # Mediastinal mass discovered with pericardial effusion: Mediastinal mass was biopsied via a CT-guided biopsy.
Thoracic surgery service followed from early in the admission to contemplate surgical options, but given that the mass appeared to wrap around the great vessels, surgery deferred to oncology and radiation oncology for the initial treatment planning with the hopes that they would be able to devise a treatment plan to shrink the mass before resection.
Preliminary biopsy results had results consistent with colon cancer.
This was puzzling, given the clinical history, and given that a follow-up CT scan of abdomen and pelvis showed no liver metastases or abdominal lymphadenopathy.
Cytgenetics did not clarify the diagnosis since the pattern does not show characteristics features of either colon or germ cell tumor.
Repeat ECHO prior to discharge showed resolution of the pericardial effusion.
# Tachycardia.
Tachycardia eased somewhat with pericardial drainage but nonetheless, ongoing atrial fibrillation with recurring RVR required significant doses of metoprolol to keep in the high 90s/low 100s.
Additionally, it appeared that for a time Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 4143**] was effectively dehydrated because of the extensive extravasation associated with his full-torso rash; IV hydration did help to reduce heart rate during this time.
Atrial fibrillation was not helpful, but during this period of dehydration was likely not the major factor.
# Rash: Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 4143**] developed a significant morbilliform rash which was consistent in appearance and clinical course with a drug rash, likely in response to lasix.
There was no mucosal involvement and the rash did begin to fade in its initial areas of appearance (back) by [**4-19**], at which point there was clearly the beginning of resolution of the original sites even as the newer areas of involvement (lower parts of upper and lower extremities) became more erythematous and confluent.
A skin biopsy was also consistent with drug rash.
Restarted aspirin (after being held by past clinicians because of past stroke), as we judged the benefit of aspirin for CAD to outweigh the risk.

Outpatient Lab Work INR - please have your INR checked next week before your appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19339**]   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Pericardial effusion Malignant mediastinal mass Atrial Fibrillation Drug Rash   Discharge Condition: Amublating, tolerating POs   Discharge Instructions: You had fluid build-up in your lungs and around your heart, which was drained.
This was likely related to the mass that has been found in the middle of your chest.
One biopsy performed showed evidence for adenocarcinoma, which was an unexpected finding.
As you are aware, you had a significant drug reaction, the most likely suspect is Lasix, or Furosemide.
If you develop a rapid heart rate, weakness, dizziness, or shortness of breath, please contact your doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] away [**Name5 (PTitle) **] return to the emergency department.
