Admission Date:  [**2165-11-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2165-12-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2120-7-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ativan / Latex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 358**] Chief Complaint: sepsis, osteomyelitis, cellulitis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: R BKA VATS TEE SubClavian access L PICC line  History of Present Illness: 45 yo M with spina bifida, paraspinal lipoma treated with high dose dexamethasone for the past 6 weeks, and nonhealing R foot ulcer x 7 years transferred from OSH with whole L leg cellulitis and intermitant chest discomfort.
In brief, on arrival in the ED the Pt was in respiratory distress and was transfered to the MICU.
The respiratory distress was thought to be secondary to narcotics.
An ECG showed diffuse ST-T changes.
An echo was done which showed a pericardial effusion.
Regarding his sepsis, in the ED the patient was tachycardic with leukocytosis with PMN predominance and elevated bands.
The most likely source of infection is the ongoing leg infections potentiated by high dose dexamethasone.
He was also noted to have a UTI which grew Klebsiella oxytoca.
He was also noted to have multiple, scatted crusted and ulcerated lesions on the skin and OP which are positive for HSV1.
His exam was consistent with thrush plus HSV esophagitis and he was started on fluconazole.
Finally, he the above noted chronic R foot ulcer and osteomyelitis for 7 years as well as L leg cellulitis.
In addition to his multiple clear infections and pericarditis, he also has swollen knees and elbows.
He also was noted to have transaminitis on admission which has improved somewhat over the past 48 hours.
The working diagnosis is hypotension induced liver damage.
He reports worsening urinary incontinence, most likely related to this lesion.
His pain is controlled.

Brief Hospital Course: 45 yo M, with h/o spina bifida and peripheral neuropathy with chronic R foot ulcer, recently diagnosed L-spine lipoma and immunosupressed on dexamethasone x 6 weeks transfered to the floor from the MICU with pericarditis, LLE cellulitis, RLE osteomyelitis and cellulitis, BCx growing group G Streptococcus and MSSA, HSV ulcers of the skin and OP, UTI with Klebsiella, paraspinal lipoma, on steroids to reduce spinal inflammation, and elevated LFTs.
There was a troponin leak post op.
# Sepsis/bacteremia (MSSA/GBS bacteremia, RLL osteomyelitis): Pt presented to ED with tachycardia, elevated bands, and GPC in initial blood culture in the setting of immunosuppression with steroids progressively worsening chronic R foot ulcer and bilateral leg cellulitis c/w sepsis.
Source of infection most likely related to patient?????
Urine was positive for Klebsiella which was treated with ceftriaxone.
There was oral thrush and odynophagia which was treated with fluconazole.
Multiple TTEs and a TEE showed no endocarditis but a pericardial effusion with no tamponade physiology.
Unclear how to interpret this in the context of Gram pos bacteremia and Hx of Zosyn use as these may lead to false positive results.
# Leukocytosis: His WBC elevation is characterized by neutrophilia with normal immature forms consistent with a reactive process.
Torso CT [**2165-11-19**] no occult abscesses or LAD with stable pericardial effusions.
Sinus CT showed ?mild sinusitis, but on effective ABx and asymptomatic.
Pt also became Cdiff positive.
Pt is on ASA given chest pain on [**2165-12-7**].
# Fever: Pt had low grade fever persistently after treatement of his obvious infections.
DD includes ongoing incompletely treated infection or an occult infection, a drug fever, or rheumatologic problem.
CTA for PE [**2165-11-29**] showed improving pulmonary nodules, stable effusions of the pericardium and pleural spaces, and stable/improving pulmonary nodules but also mediastinal LAD.
So far preliminary results are consistent with fibrosis and chronic scarring of the pericardium.
# Pericarditis/pericardial effusion: Etiology most likely infectious and treated with antibiotics.
Cardiology was consulted and saw no deranged physiology and recommended follow up.
On [**2165-12-7**] developed CP with T inv in I II V4-6.
Unclear if the ECG changes are [**2-23**] pericardial fibrosis as no recent baseline.
Also concerning given history of TRP leak post op and hx of cocaine abuse.
# Tachycardia: Likely [**2-23**] multiple etiologies including systemic inflammatory response/sepsis, pain, anxiety, and pericarditis.
No evidence of tamponade on Echo.
# Pain control: Pt with a history of cocaine addiction.
Adjusting regimen to minimize narcotic exposure with optimal comfort.
# Neurogenic Bladder: On oxybutinin.
# Troponin leak post op: Unclear if this is due to a perioperative MI or troponin leak from pericarditis.
TTE was NL with no major changes from previous ECHOs.
# Joint pain and inflammation: Pt reports having increased bil (L>R) knee pain with decreased ROM.
R knee was tapped and not consistent with septic joint.
Concern for inflammatory process, possibly secondary to Streptococcal infection.
# R foot ulcer/Osteomyelitis: Chronic issue over past 7yrs; secondary to peripheral neuopathy from spina bifida and tethered cord syndrome; well known to plastics team.
Followed by plastics, wound nurse, and podiatry (staffed with podiatry at time of transfer).
CT of foot with probable OM and gas in the soft tissue.
Will f/u with vascular in the beginning of [**12-30**] for staple removal.
# Cellulitis: Most likely from organisms of his bacteremia (group G Strep), but could be other Gram positives or even anaerobes and Gram negatives.
# HSV: Hand and upper lip ulcerations in setting of immunosuppression.
# Odynophagia: Admitted with thrush and on high dose steroids.
Considering possible candidia esophagitis.
Also considering HSV esophagitis given that patient has HSV1 positive lesions of the OP.
# L-spine Lipoma: MRI showed a lipoma with an element of inflammation with possible compression related to this lesion.
Free T4 (WNL) and T3 (low) c/w subclinical hyperthyroidism.
Reports recent change in levothyroxine qday which could exacerbate tachycardia and changes in labs may not be apparent so close to change in dosage.
Likely [**2-23**] bacterial overgrowth on dexamethasone.
# Lung nodule.
Pt has several small lung nodules which will need interval follow up in 3 to 6 months with a non-contrast chest CT.
