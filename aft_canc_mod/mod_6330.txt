Admission Date:  [**2112-11-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2112-11-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-11-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**] Chief Complaint: transfer for radiation oncology evaluation  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation PICC placement [**2112-11-21**] tracheostomy, PEG, thoracentesis  History of Present Illness: 55 yo female with history of tobacco abuse and chronic back pain transferred from [**Hospital6 33**] for Oncology and Radiation Oncology evaluation.
Per the patient's family, she had been complaining of upper respiratory symptoms including nasal congestion, drainage, cough for approximately 2 months.
Her daughter referred her to her own ENT who ordered a CT chest to evaluate for SVC syndrome.
The CT showed RUL and RML collapse due to a central obstructing lesion as well as bulky lymphadenopathy.
The patient was referred to the [**Hospital3 **] ED, and admitted for malignancy evaluation.
On admission she had a thoracentesis which did not show evidence of malignancy.
She was transferred to the ICU on [**2112-11-6**] for respiratory decompensation.
On [**2112-11-8**], thoracic surgery performed a rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy which showed non-small cell lung cancer.
The patient was intubated initially for this procedure, extubated, but then developed respiratory failure 20 min later requiring reintubation.
They report she has chronic severe back pain from scoliosis which is likely contributing to her discomfort.
Unable to obtain review of systems secondary to intubation.
Past Medical History: Non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed [**10-17**], SVC syndrome Scoliosis, chronic back pain s/p cholecystectomy s/p hysterectomy   Social History: The patient lives in [**State 108**] with her husband.
Family History: NC, no known lung cancer  Physical Exam: GENERAL: Intubated sedated in NAD HEENT: neck has dilated veins, plethoric, normocephalic, atraumatic.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
Neck Supple, No LAD, No thyromegaly.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
LUNGS:  Rhonchi bilaterally, decreased air movement on right upper, no wheezes or crackles.
MRI head [**2112-11-6**]:  Nonspecific small foci of increased T2 and Flair signal in the subcortical white matter likely represent small vessel ischemic change.
No mass or metastatic disease.
CT Abd/pelvis [**2112-11-6**]:  Large right pleural effusion, compressive atelecatsis, no liver lesions, no abdominal mass or adenopathy, 3mm right renal calculus, edema in the subcutaneous fat of the anterior chest wall as well as the right and left breast.
no pelvic mass   Brief Hospital Course: #.
Respiratory Failure:  She was intubated at an OSH for respiratory distress.
She had a high a-A gradient throughout admission that was felt to be secondary to shunt physiology with collapse of her right upper and right middle lobe.
She had an initial bronchoscopy the day after admission which showed a large tumor burden obstructing the airways.
She had a stent placed by IP on [**11-13**] to the right main stem bronchus to prevent further collapse.
The fluid was negative for malignant cells.
Repeat CXR showed slow reaccumulation of pleural effusion, but her respiratory function remained stable with attempts to diurese her further.
If her respiratory function acutely worsens, would consider CXR to assess fluid status, diuresis with prn lasix and/or thoracentesis to drain pleural fluid.
SVC Syndrome:  She initiallly presented to the OSH with facial swelling secondary to SVC sydrome due to her lung mass and bulky lymphadenopathy.
Her neck and facial swelling worsened from [**Date range (1) 84136**], and she was restarted on dexamethasone 4 mg [**Hospital1 **] with a plan to slowly taper down to a low dose (4 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 days then decrease to 2 mg [**Hospital1 **] (on [**12-1**]) and assess response.
If pt continues to have better controlled edema and no vomiting, it can eventually be decreased to 2 mg qd.
Goal is smallest dose possible to keep symptoms under control and to allow of increase in dose if symptoms reoccur.
Bleeding: On [**11-23**], she had an episode of bleeding from her PEG tube, increasing abdominal pain, and a hematocrit drop.
She was given a total of 2 units of blood and her bleeding stopped.
GI did an endoscopy on [**11-25**] and found an ulcer which was injected with epinephrine and her hematocrit remained stable, although dropped slightly (2 points of the day of discharge).
Chronic Back pain:  She has chronic pain secondary to scoliosis.
She was also started on Methadone, but felt that this precipitated nausea and made her somnolent.
Anxiety: She had substantial anxiety and was managed with benzodiazepines scheduled and as needed.
There was some concern that she had some confusion with ativan, but it was felt that the anxiolytic benefits outweighed the possible confusion.
At the time of discharge, the patient was maintained on standing klonopin with ativan prn for anxiolysis as needed.
The team felt that much of her pain was being relieved by treating this anxiety.
Vomiting/Nutrition:  Patient had multiple episodes of vomiting without nausea during her radiation therapy.
This resolved and was thought to be due to esophagitis.
It was of unclear etiology though the patient thought it was due to Methadone.
As the steroids had been recently stopped, and there was increased neck swelling, there was concern for worsening SVC syndrome, brain edema, and/or anxiety causing the vomiting.
However, the patient felt this vomiting was due to Methadone so it was stopped.
The patient had no vomiting since [**11-28**].

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Non-small cell lung cancer Superior vena cava syndrome  Secondary Diagnosis: Venous thrombosis   Discharge Condition: Ambulating only with physical therapy present, vital signs stable, requiring intermittent ventilatory support   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with respiratory failure on an ventilator.
You had blood clots in the veins in your neck and chest and were started on blood thinners to treat these blood clots.
If you continue to have better controlled swelling and no vomiting, it can eventually be decreased to 2 mg daily.
The goal is to give the smallest dose possible to keep symptoms under control.
