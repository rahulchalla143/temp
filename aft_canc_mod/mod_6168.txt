Admission Date:  [**2187-10-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2187-10-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2115-4-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5341**] Chief Complaint: Ataxia, dysarthria, left facial droop; transfer from neurosurgery.
History of Present Illness: 72 year-old woman with h/o NSCLC on Tarceva, PE on coumadin (since [**6-/2186**]) presented on [**2187-10-24**] with 4 days left facial droop, ataxia, dysarthria and found to have multiple bihemispheric intracranial masses with associated hemorrhage.
Also noted some difficulty speaking ("mouth doesn't want to work right").
These symptoms progressively worsened and she called her oncologist who asked her to hold chemotherapy and present for clinic evaluation.
Her daughter decided to take her to an OSH [**Name (NI) **] for evaluation where a head CT revealed multiple hemorrhagic masses, the largest of which was in the right frontal lobe but the most notable of which was in the left pons, with evidence of right lateral IVH.
Concern for possible seizure activity during evaluation.
Admitted to Neuro-ICU for monitoring.
In the neuro-ICU, serial imaging showed her brain mets to be stable and there were no new focal deficits noted on physical exam.
On transfer to the OMED service, she denied nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or blurry vision.
She had a mild headache.
She felt weak in the legs, and noticed herself drooling, but otherwise had no focal neurologic complaints.
Past Medical History: Past Medical/Oncological History: Non-small cell lung cancer s/p 1 year of chemotherapy recently finished and currently on Tarceva (EGFR inhibitor), followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1528**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Location (un) 5503**], MA) PE on coumadin Remote CVA HTN Hypercholesterolemia s/p TAH-BSO Prior stroke many years ago, presenting with right hand clumsiness and dysarthria, no residual symptoms  Social History: Smoked ppd but quit many years ago.
She has slightly slurred speech, although no word-finding difficulty and no aphasia.
HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric sclera, conjunctivae pink Neck: supple, no LAD Cardiac: RRR, s1s2 normal, no m/r/g Pulmonary: Clear to ausculatation bilaterally anterior and posterior fields Abdomen: +BS, soft, nontender, nondistended Extremities: warm, 2+ DP pulses, no edema Neuro: A&Ox3, speech clear and logical, CNII-XII intact, moves all extremities .
There is no tongue deviation.
Babinski sign is downward bilaterally.
She spells W-O-R-L-D forwards and backwards with no difficulty.
She can follow three-step commands without difficulty.
Multifocal parenchymal hemorrhages suspicious for underlying mass lesions; given the history non-small cell lung cancer metastases are likely.
Surrounding edema with effacement of sulci.
No evidence of herniation or hydrocephalus.
MRI Brain ([**2187-10-25**]) There are multiple masses located in the brain that have characteristics consistent with multiple hemorrhagic metastases.
There is a 22 x 19 mm mass in the left frontal lobe, a 18 x 18 mm mass in the right occipital lobe, and a 19 x 15 mm mass in the right frontal lobe.
There is also a mass in the left pons.
There is vasogenic edema surrounding the lesions.
There is a left frontal developmental venous anomaly.
No diffusion abnormalities are detected.
IMPRESSION: Multiple hemorrhagic masses consistent with hemorrhagic metastatic foci in the left frontal, the right frontal, left pons, and right occipital lobes.
Brief Hospital Course: A 72 year-old woman with h/o NSCLC on Tarceva presented [**10-25**] with slurred speech and left-sided facial droop, found to have multiple brain mets with surrounding hemorrhage and edema on head CT, now transferred to oncologic medicine from neurosurgury for whole brain XRT.
METASTATIC NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER The multiple hemorrhagic brain mets were stable on imaging per neurosurgery; her coagulopathy was reversed with vitamin K and FFP, and her coumadin was held.
There was concern that hypertension might exacerbate the intracranial bleeding, and thus her SBP was tightly controlled to maintain SBP <160.
Her symptoms gradually improved.
Her dilantin has been uptitrated to therapeutic serum levels at a dose of 200 mg twice daily.
PULMONARY EMBOLISM This was diagnosed in the summer of [**2185**], according to the patient.
If as she says her pulmonary embolism occurred 12 months ago, there is no emergent need for anticoagulation at this time, and certainly the bleeding risks outweigh the benefits.
PAROTID GLAND SWELLING Two days after starting whole brain XRT, she developed swelling in the region of the right parotid gland.
We believe that she has suffered radiation-related parotitis.
We treated her symptoms with warm compresses and artificial saliva to help stimulate the gland and promote secretion of excess parotid fluid.
HYPERTENSION We continued her home valsartan and Toprol XL.
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA We continued her home statin.
Pneumoboots were used for prophylaxis, and her home dose PPI provided prophylaxis against stress ulcers.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain or T > 100.4.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia for 1 doses.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS Lung cancer with brain metastases .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia History of stroke   Discharge Condition: Vital signs stable.
There was concern that some of the lesions in the brain were bleeding, which may have been the cause for your confusion, slurred speech, and difficulty balancing when you came to the hospital.
You have been started on dexamethasone to help decrease the swelling surrounding some of the lesions in parts of the brain.
This will help to improve speech, balance, and other neurologic symptoms.
You have also been started on two anti-seizure medicines, Keppra and Dilantin, to help prevent any more seizures from occurring.
Please call your doctor or come to the hospital if you have any neurologic symptoms or other symptoms that are concerning to you.
Followup Instructions: Please return to [**Hospital1 18**] for completion of the whole brain radiation.
