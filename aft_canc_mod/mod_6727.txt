FINDINGS: Following interval changes are seen as compared to the previous examination: there is no endoleak seen on the current examination.
There is a hematoma surrounding the thoracic stent in the aorta.
Pleural fluid is of similar small amount in the left pleural cavity.
Localized flap is seen in the abdominal aorta and it was not seen in the previous exam.
Further noted that left inguinal hematoma, which was seen in the previous examination, currently is of the smaller size and of lower density with number of air bubbles in it, most probably due to the recent intervention.
Localized flap in the abdominal aorta at the level of L4 at the right lateral wall.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Markedly dilated descending aorta Thickened aortic wall c/w intramural hematoma.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The descending thoracic aorta is markedly dilated.
The aortic wall is thickened consistent with an intramural hematoma.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen ( washing jets).
