While down in [**Location (un) 80056**] in [**Month (only) 216**] visiting his children when he developed some left sided-weakness and numbness.
He underwent a brain biopsy at a [**Hospital 5170**] hospital on [**2147-10-5**] which revealed a preliminary DX of grade II Astrocytoma.
From there he while traveling to [**Location (un) 86**], MA he developed acute shortness of breath on [**2147-10-14**], Upon landinghe was taken to an outside ED and later transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]  where he was intubated for airway protection and dyspnea.
He was found to have a small PE.
While in [**Hospital1 18**] ED his neurologic status and exam deteriorated.
He became more lethargic, not following commands, and without spontaneous speech.
Physical exam revealed a dense left hemiplegia.
No abnormal movements, tremors.

EKG([**10-14**]): Sinus bradycardia.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX BIOPSY: Brain, frontal lobe, right, biopsy:  Subcortical white matter with sharply demarcated zones of demyelination.
Immunohistochemical stains for CD68 and CD3 show dense infiltration of macrophages and scattered T cells in areas of demyelination.
These findings are consistent with multiple sclerosis in the appropriate clinical context.
Imaging: CTA Chest([**10-15**]): IMPRESSION: Small peripheral pulmonary embolus within the right lower lobe.
Head CT([**10-15**]): IMPRESSION: Extensive edema of the hemispheres, with involvement of the corpus callosum, compatible with the reported history of glioblastoma multiforme.
LE Ultrasound ([**10-15**]): IMPRESSION: No evidence of lower extremity DVT.
Extensive bifrontal vasogenic edema with two small foci of enhancement.
Given the overall paucity of enhancement, hemorrhage or necrosis, however, lymphoma remains a distinct possibility.
Small amount of blood products along the right frontal lobe biopsy tract.
Unusual pattern of non-enhancing uniform T1- and T2-hyperintensity confined to the right basal ganglia, of unclear etiology, but likely secondary to the adjacent extensive tumor and peritumoral edema, perhaps on the basis of altered perfusion (though there is no evidence of frank infarction); a less likely consideration is direct tumor infiltration.
MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 430**]([**10-19**]): Redemonstration of extensive bifrontal edema infiltrating the corpus callosum, with small areas of posterior enhancement.
Correlation with prior MR examinations is critical to evaluate the evolution of these findings in the setting of the patient's biopsy and possible ischemic event.
Abnormal pectroscopic evaluation demonstrating high choline in all three regions selected, which can be seen in malignant brain tumors but also can be seen with lymphoma and demyelination, as well as infectious processes.
No specific evidence of intracranial infection; though subtle findings of infection may be obscured by the global abnormalities, above.
New opacification of the sphenoid sinuses, and thickening of the right frontal sinus; though these findings may be "passiv," related to prolonged supine positioning and/or intubation, infection cannot be excluded.
Extensive bifrontal edema infiltrating the corpus callosum with small foci of marginal enhancement, dorsally, overall stable, with no new enhancing focus seen.
Further pathologic T1-hyperintensity within the right basal ganglia, and in cortex overlying the zones of white matter edema, of uncertain clinical significance.
Though this may relate to a primary infiltrative neoplastic (or demyelinative) process, secondary ischemic or neurodegenerative processes remain differential considerations.
No obvious neoplastic process identified in the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
Small left upper lobe pulmonary nodule is unchanged compared to [**2147-10-15**].
In the absence of malignancy or significant risk factors (ie smoking), no further follow-up is needed.
No significant change in extent of white matter FLAIR hyperintensity and right basal ganglia T1 hyperintensity from recent MRI from [**11-15**].
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after immediate transfer from [**Location (un) 6692**] airport for respiratory distress.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was apparently visiting with his family in [**Location (un) 5770**], LA, when he developed left sided weakness and sensory deficits.
During this hospitalization, he was discovered to have significant bilateral frontal brain mass.
During his medical flight to MA, he experienced SOB and desaturations and upon landing was taken to an OSH ED where he was intubated and later transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after a subsegmental PE was identified.
He was initially managed in the ICU for two days secondary to his respiratory status issues, but after several subsequent stable blood gasses and no further issues with respiration; he was weaned to extubation.
Neuro-oncology and radiation oncology consults were obtained, and secondary to the inadequacy of documentation provided, it was recommended to pursue an additional biopsy.
In the interim however, various specialized MRI and PET scans were ordered to further interrogate the pathology of his intracranial mass.
His initial pathology was reviewed by another outside pathologist and the slides were sent here for review and the final descision, as above, is a demyelinating process and not oncologic.
He had an LP which was unremarkable and negative for oligoclonal bands.
Sginificant but unrelated findings incluided evidenve of prior Hep B infection and low TSH and eleveated TPO antibody.
For his demyelinating lesion he completed 5 days of 1gm/day IV solumedrol and 5 days of IVIG without any response.
He had minimal amount of RBC's in urine which cleared with hydration and resolved after finishing the course of cytoxan.
Left UE is flaccid paresis and LE is antigravity.
Sensation is intact throughout but he does extinguish with bilateral stimulation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Tower [**Doctor Last Name **] Center  Discharge Diagnosis: Demyelinating CNS disorder   Discharge Condition: Neurologically Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because of severe weakness of your left arm and leg.
