Admission Date: [**2102-2-8**]        Discharge Date: [**2102-2-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2031-8-15**]        Sex:  M  Service:  [**Last Name (un) 7081**]   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70 year old male with Stage 2A esophageal cancer status post chemo and radiation treatment.
Also of note, this patient has myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] status post thymectomy and apheresis, transient ischemic attack in the past, silent myocardial infarction in [**2092**], hematuria and rosacea.
Mr. [**Known lastname 4427**] has a history of developing regurgitation that began in [**2101-7-31**] that was associated with dysphagia without odynophagia and in addition, lost 15 lb.
He had a barium swallow which showed a 3 cm polypoid mass in the distal esophagus.
An infiltrative, fungated and partially obstructing nonbleeding 5 cm mass was seen at the lower third of the esophagus.
Generally, this was a well-appearing male in no acute distress.
Oropharynx was moist and clear with no mucositis or thrush.
Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy cervically or supraclavicularly and there was no infraclavicular lymphadenopathy as well.
There were no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Back showed no spinal or costovertebral angle tenderness.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, protuberant, obese with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed no clubbing or edema.
Skin revealed minimal bilateral nasal rosacea, a well- healed mid sternal scar, minimal erythema on the back from radiation skin changes and a port site that was clean, dry and intact with no erythema and was nontender.
The patient received 5.8 liters of crystalloid fluid in the operating room and there was a blood loss of an estimated 200 ml during the operation.
He was extubated shortly after the operation on the afternoon of [**2102-2-8**] and was complaining of only peri-incisional pain and tenderness near the right posterior back incision.
He stated that he was not short of breath at this time and did not feel weak and did not feel he was having any diplopia.
On postoperative day 1, the patient required a bolus of 500 cc of Lactated Ringers for mean arterial pressure near 65 and an elevated lactate, responded well to this and the patient was continued on maintenance level IV fluids.
The patient was also followed by the Neuromuscular Service and their plan was to commence Mestinon and CellCept for his myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] in that if the patient began suffering increasing weakness or worsening respiratory status, to call Neurology at once and not to increase the Mestinon and to consider possibly plasmapheresis.
On postoperative day 1, in the evening, the patient seemed to be developing fatigability and respiratory issues and was shown to have some aspect of congestive heart failure on a chest x- ray.
The Neurology Service was consulted at once and suggested that the vital capacity and negative inspiratory force be checked every 2 hours and that the patient may need intubation and diuresis.
The patient was having a significant oxygen requirement at this time and was also complaining of shortness of breath.
His urine output was noted to briskly increase after both doses of Lasix with some improvement in symptoms and exam.
On [**2102-2-10**], postoperative day 2, the patient received a bronchoscopy and there was noted to be multiple plugs of mucus in the lower lobes, right greater than left.
The patient required intubation as well on the second postoperative day due to increased oxygen requirement and fatigability.
On postoperative day 4, the patient was noted to have had episodes over the last 24 hours of hypotension, again requiring fluid boluses with fever to 102 degrees.
The patient at this time also had bilateral chest tubes with the left putting out copious drainage and the patient was also transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells at this time.
There were no complications to the procedure and the tracheostomy was placed carefully and safely.
On postoperative day 7, his right jugular venous line was changed for fevers and he was noted to be tolerating a pressure support wean fairly well and was down to pressures [**4-4**] and PEEP of 5 at 50 percent for 4 hours.
There were noted to be copious secretions with mucus plugging and a therapeutic aspiration was performed especially in the right lower lobe.
On [**2-16**], postoperative day 8, on chest x-ray, it appeared the patient had a right sided pneumonia.
Also, at this time, the patient received a CTA that was negative for pulmonary embolus.
The patient developed increasing dyspnea and on the chest x-ray, it was noted that the patient had a large right pneumothorax.
There were noted to be some thin secretions and bronchus intermedius and a bronchoalveolar lavage was sent for culture.
Of note, there were still no positive cultures of any kind at this time from the blood, sputum, urine or pleural fluid.
The patient received a bedside swallowing evaluation on [**2102-2-20**] and was noted to be doing well, but to be maintained NPO until an upper GI study ruled out free reflux or regurgitation of material into oropharynx in regards to maintaining a safety against aspiration.
The plan at this point was for plasmapheresis for myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] issues.
There was no pneumothorax and the patient was allowed to advance his diet after the swallow studies.
On postoperative day 14, later in the day, the patient suffered another right-sided pneumothorax requiring placement of a chest tube that was placed mid clavicularly in the second intercostal space.
On postoperative day 16, later in the day, the patient was noted to have decreased breath sounds on the right by the nurse taking care of the patient and a chest x- ray was obtained at this time that showed reacquired right pneumothorax.
The patient is to be placed on tracheostomy mask during the day when suitable and to receive is having shortness of breath, chest pain, fevers, chills, nausea or vomiting or if there are any questions or concerns.
