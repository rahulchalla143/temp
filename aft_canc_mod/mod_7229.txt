Denied head trauma or LOC.
Summoned EMS who found him pale and diaphoretic, and with 1-2 seconds or jerking movements.
Initial ECG reportedly showed STD with TWI in v3-v5.
First set of labs were remarkable for hyperglycemia and a mildly elevated WBC at 11.9, but without left shift.
Given concern for a primary cardiac process, a bedside TTE by ED staff was performed with concern for LV systolic dysfunction.
This examination showed no new WMA and overall preserved EF.
His early hospital course was notable for gradual slowing of his sinus tach in the low 100s down to sinus brady of high 40s with subsequent sinus arrest with junctional escape in 40s.
He sustains this for a little over 1 minute and then a wide complex rhythm at a rate of 70s, and ultimately PEA arrest.
On ROS, pt states he has had 2 weeks of a nonproductive dry cough.

There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is focal basal right ventricular free wall hypokinesis with preservation of apical motion ([**Last Name (un) **] sign is present).
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The descending thoracic aorta is moderately dilated.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Right ventricular basal hypokinesis with pressure and volume overload, consistent with hemodynamically significant PE.
Severe left ventricular hypertrophy and small chamber size indicate decreased preload.
Focal area of parenchymal airspace density is seen within the left upper lobe, which may reflect a developing pneumonia.
There are small bibasilar pleural effusions and associated atelectasis as well.
No pneumothorax.
There is extensive subcutaneous edema and enlargement of the pectoralis muscles anteriorly, right greater than left.
This may be due to recent attempted line placement.
No focal hematoma is seen.
Possible small area of developing pneumonia in the left upper lobe.
MRI [**2101-10-25**] OF BRACHIAL PLEXUS MRI OF THE BRACHIAL PLEXUS: A marker was placed on the skin overlying the site of palpable abnormality in the region of the right mid clavicle.
Abnormal ill-defined heterogeneous signal is seen within the subcutaneous tissues immediately underlying the skin marker, and surrounding the mid right clavicle.
This signal abnormality is isointense with respect to the skeletal muscle on T1-weighted images, and minimally hyperintense with respect to the skeletal muscle on T2-weighted images.
This abnormal signal nearly completely surrounds the mid clavicle, including the anterior and posterior aspects, and likely represents resolving hematoma and scarring.
There is apparent associated tethering of adjacent tissue structures by the resolving hematoma and scarring, most pronounced in the mid-retroclavicular area, where the right brachial plexus structures appear to be focally tethered anteriorly and somewhat kinked (series 9, image 19).
The brachial plexus fibers otherwise are intact and unremarkable, without nodularity, clumping, or abnormal signal within the fibers themselves.
No clumping, nodularity, deformity, or extrinsic mass effect is seen upon the fibers of the left brachial plexus.
No other mediastinal lesions are [**Month/Day/Year 3780**].
No right clavicular fracture is identified.
Abnormal signal surrounding the mid right clavicle likely represents resolving hematoma and early scarring.
There is adjacent focal tethering of the right brachial plexus structures as a result of this resolving hematoma/scarring, but the remainder of the brachial plexus appears intact and unremarkable.
Resolving small intramuscular hematoma within the left inferior sternocleidomastoid muscle   Brief Hospital Course: PULMONARY EMBOLUS / SHOCK Pt with suspected PE as shown by RV dilation on Echo with decreased LF volume.
In concern for septic shock given residual low blood pressures, antibiotics were initially given, and stopped after diagnosis of PE was confirmed.
They were restarted out of concern for penumonia, and then stoped again after 3-5 days when no cultures were positive.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE The patient was intubated secondary to metabolic acidosis, VQ mismatch and hypotension.
Over time, he showed signs of improving pulmonary perfusion and decreasing dead space.
Serial chest x-rays were performed showing improvement of a collapsed lung and decreasing pulmonary infiltrate.
For the remainder of his stay, the patient was provided Albuterol and Ipratropium nebulizers as needed for chest tightness and encouraged to use incentive spirometry.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE The patient experienced acute kindey injury secondary to shock.
Renal was consulted, his urine increased output and renal function was monitored daily, and all of his medications were renally dosed.
Based on close observation, the patient does not demonstrate any cognitive or behavioral sequelae from his anoxic period.
COAGULOPATHY The patient experienced coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia secondary to tPA and heparin in the MICU.
HYPERTENSION The patient's systolic blood pressure was initially elevated in the MICU secondary to sedation ween and extubation.
As an inpatient, Mr. [**Known lastname 100510**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3780**] elevated blood glucose values likely due to acute on chronic insulin resistance.
LEUKOCYTOSIS ?UTI The patient's white blood cell count became elevated after transfer to the floor, peaking at 15.0 on [**10-18**].
He was also found to have a positive urine analysis at this time and was placed on Augmentin 500 [**Hospital1 **] for 1 week given concern for urinary tract infection and the effect of conventional UTI therapy on INR levels.
A final urine culture was found to be negative and there were no signs of infection at discharge.
ANEMIA The patient has had a low hematocrit since admission, reaching a low of 23.6 on [**10-27**].
His mean corpuscular volume was borderline low and iron studies were consistent with a mixed iron deficiency anemia and anemia of inflammation.
A reticulocyte count was found to be appropriate for his anemia and the patient was placed on supplemental iron.
CAD MANAGEMENT The patient had a cardiac catheterization in [**11-16**] that showed total occlusion in the mid-right coronary artery and an angioplasty attempt during procedure was unsuccessful.
He takes ibuprofen, naproxen, and indomethacin for pain control.
As an inpatient, Mr. [**Known lastname 100510**] experienced new foot and ankle pain and was initially given Prednisone 30mg daily with resolution of the pain.
His pain remained well-controlled for the remainder of his stay.
OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA The patient was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea in [**2099**] [**4-17**] and maintained on CPAP at 11 cm of water pressure using a ResMed UltraMirage full facemask.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Two (2) Puff Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Ipratropium Bromide 17 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Two (2) Puff Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Camphor-Menthol 0.5-0.5 % Lotion Sig: One (1) Appl Topical QID (4 times a day) as needed for itching.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted on [**2101-10-5**] for lightheadedness, and found to have a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot that had traveled from your leg to your lung.
You were treated in the intensive care unit, where you had a cardiac arrest requiring resuscitation.
You developed kidney problems as a result of this, with some degree of recovery at discharge.
