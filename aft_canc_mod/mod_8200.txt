CXRFINDINGS [**5-8**] :  There are no old films available for comparison.
The heart is mildly enlarged.
Both hemidiaphragms are obscured likely due to a combination of volume loss and effusions.
There is mild pulmonary vascular re-distribution and some alveolar opacities.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Bilateral moderate-to-large simple pleural effusions.
Bilateral consolidations associated with the pleural effusions.
These most likely represent atelectasis, although in the proper clinical setting, pneumonia cannot be excluded.
7-mm ground-glass nodular opacity and two sub-4-mm pulmonary nodules in the left upper lobe.
Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly.
ECHO [**5-9**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
No premature appearance of agitated saline is seen at rest.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with mild posterior leaflet elongation, but no frank systolic prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
There is a left sided pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild mitral regurgitation without discrete vegetation or definite systolic prolapse.
No vegitations seen.
Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Volume overload as evidenced by moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions, cardiomegaly and anasarca.
Mediastinal and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules is concerning for metastatic disease.
Followup CT of the chest could be performed in three to six months to document stability of the pulmonary nodules.
In the setting of a large heart and dilated hepatic veins, a cardiac etiology should be considered.
CXR [**5-19**] IMPRESSION:  Unchanged small left and trace right pleural effusions since [**2185-5-15**].
Brief Hospital Course: 81 yo F with hx of SCC, Afib, HTN who presents with UTI and L hydronephrosis s/p stent placement found to by hypoxic with large bilateral pleural effusions now improved after R. thoracentesis and course complicated by [**Female First Name (un) **] cystitis and severe C. diff infection.
Respiratory Failure/hypoxia due to pleural effusions - Patient found to have large bilateral pleural effusions after aggressive fluid administration during urology procedure.
Pleural effusions were thought to be due to volume overload related to aggressive volume given during urology procedure combined with low albumin state.
She has no renal failure or evidence of CHF on echo to explain volume overload.
Alternatively, pleural fluid was exudative by LDH criteria and given history of malignancy there was also concern for possible malignant effusion.
Patient responded well to IV diuresis (20 mg IV Lasix) and was able to wean to low-mid 90s on room air without evidence of respiratory distress.
She was not discharged on oral Lasix given that she was orthostatic on exam.
Severe C. difficile colitis with leukocytosis - Patient found to have sudden increase in her white blood cell count to 30,000 with diarrhea.
She was found to have positive C. diff toxin and initiated on IV Flagyl.
Given abdominal distention, she underwent a CT Torso which showed proctitis likely related to C. diff infection but otherwise no evidence of occult infection or megacolon.
The imaging did however show concern for metastatic disease.
Infectious disease was therefore consulted who felt her WBC was consistent with C. diff plus a leukemoid reaction, possibly related to her malignancy.
She remained stable with soft bowel movements with mild abdominal distention, but no pain, fever, or ileus.
However, if patient has no worsening symptoms in the 2 days following discharge, she can change the vancomycin dose to 125 mg QID to complete her course.
Bacterial/Fungal UTI - Patient was admitted on antibiotics to treat complicated urine infection.
Urine culture showed E. coli sensitive to cephalosporins.
AFib: Presented with supra therapeutic INR which was subsequently reversed for thoracentesis.
She was also restarted on her home metoprolol however she became bradycardic and this was discontinued.
4. hypertension - Patient continued on diltiazem.
- Monitor for resolution of her orthostasis  5.
6. squamous cell carcinoma - s/p chemo and radiation with evidence of metastatic disease on imaging, with LAD and pulmonary nodules.
Patient was started on long acting pain control with OxyContin and continued on oxycodone prn for breakthrough.
Poor Nutritional Status: Patient with poor appetite and albumin notably was 3.2.
transitional issues: - C diff infection - She was discharged on 500 mg QID.
However, if patient has no worsening symptoms in the 2 days after discharge, can change the dose of vancomycin to 125 mg QID to complete her course.
- Goals of care: patient with clear end of life wishes, discussed with daughter; no code/compressions, but OK to intubate if respiratory failure - patient will need INR checked daily.
If she gains more than 5 pounds, develops worsening lower extremity edema or respiratory distress, would restart Lasix at either 20 mg IV or 40 mg oral.
Notably patient had episodes of orthostasis while being diuresed.
- patient will need to follow up with her oncologist regarding her leukocytosis and metastatic disease to address further treatment and goals of care.
- Patient will need to follow up with urology for management of her ureteral stents.
Medications on Admission: -Warfarin 2mg PO daily -Nifedipine XL 120mg PO daily -Fluticasone Propionate 0.05% -Toprol XL 50mg PO daily -Nitrofurantoin 50mg PO daily -Diltiazem 240mg PO daily -Alprazolam 0.25mg PO qhs -APAP/Codeine 300/30mg PO q4h PRN pain -Famotidine 20mg PO daily   Discharge Medications: 1.

You were admitted to the hospital with difficulty breathing after a recent urologic procedure.
You were found to have fluid around your lungs (pleural effusions), likely caused by getting fluids during your operation.
In addition to this you were treated for both a bacterial and yeast urine infection with medications.
You were also found to have an infection called Clostridium difficile colitis which you started treatment for.
Please START taking - oral vancomycin 500 mg every 6 hours for total 14 days (day 1 [**5-22**]) - lasix 40 mg as needed if weight increases by more than five pounds - oxycontin 10 mg three times a day - oxycodone 5 mg every six hours as needed for pain .
