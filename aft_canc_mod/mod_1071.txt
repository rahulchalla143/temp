right-handed man with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], who presents with four to five month history of progressive weakness and increased shortness of breath.
In [**2164-12-29**], he had right hip surgery and since then he has never recovered to this late [**Month (only) 956**] or early [**Month (only) 958**], he developed a pneumonia.
Since then he has had progressive weakness and fatigue.
Additionally, he is having increased problem swallowing.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] began having symptoms of dysphasia approximately 1??????
EMG done in [**2164-4-29**] done at [**Hospital1 69**] showed electrophysiologic evidence of single-fiber examination for a generalized disorder of neuromuscular transmission, but there were also features of a mild myopathic process of denervating features and mild-to-moderate sensory motor polyneuropathy, predominately axonal in nature.
He also had a positive acetylcholine-receptor antibody titer of 6.2 nanomoles per liter.
In the past three weeks he has also had visual hallucinations awakening him from sleep.
On one or two occasions, he has also had hallucinations during the daytime.
The patient also has hypertension, prostate cancer, hypothyroidism, congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, and gout.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
The patient had a distant alcohol and tobacco use in the [**2103**].
GENERAL: The patient was a pleasant, interactive, well-developed, well-nourished man in no acute distress.
The patient had some slight erythema and crusting around the right lateral eye.
Oropharynx was clear without lesions.
Neck was supple, no JVD, no bruits.
CARDIAC:  Examination revealed normal S1 and S2, regular rate with some ectopic beats, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
LUNGS:  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, but with diminished breath sounds at the bases.
The patient follows three-step commands, no apraxia or left-to-right confusion.
The patient interprets complex visual scene.
Voice is soft, nasal, and slightly slurred.
There is no nystagmus.
The patient does have diplopia on up and lateral gaze to the right, but there is no ptosis.
He has a weak cough and wet voice after sips of water.
There is no pronator drift.
Fifteen repetitions of right arm shoulder extension strength becomes [**5-3**] at the deltoid.
Bulk was increased in the bilateral lower extremities.
Sensory examination revealed diminished light touch, pinprick and temperature and stocking distribution left to the knee and right to the mid shin.
He also has an anesthetic patch in the left lower femoral cutaneous distribution that is old.
Coordination is intact with rapid alternating movements and finger-to-nose testing.
Gait testing was deferred as the patient complained of dyspnea on exertion throughout the examination.
He did have short-shuffling steps, no Romberg, and he was unable to tandem.
Chest x-ray revealed possible right effusion and a questionable nodule at the left base.
PFTs from [**2165-5-29**], results are consistent with moderate restrictive lung disease in which there was no improvement with bronchodilators.
There was a moderate reduction in maximal breathing capacity.
These results may indicate the reduced spirometry related to obesity, moderate hypoxemia with PO2 of 61, pCO2 of 47, indicating mild respiratory acidosis.
ADDENDUM:  The patient has had three visits to the [**Location (un) 620**] Emergency Department for dyspnea in the past month.
He had a swallowing study performed on the 20th, which revealed aspiration of barium.
The patient was on telemetry and several episodes of bradycardia and PVCs were noted.
On [**7-21**], he had a cardiac event of bradycardia and apnea.
While in the MICU, it was discovered that Mr. [**Known lastname **] had an aspiration pneumonitis versus pneumonia.
On the [**7-26**], the patient remained with little changes.
The cardiac issues appeared to be improving, as he was no longer having brachycardiac episodes, but he remained with persistent tachycardia on Lopressor 50 mg PO q.i.d.
On [**8-3**], the patient was transferred back to the unit for worsening weakness to the Neurological Intensive Care Unit.
On the 16th, the patient was noted to have some bleeding around the PEG tube site with a small drop in the hematocrit.
For the continuing arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation the patient was started on Digoxin.
The patient continued to have bloody output from the Foley.
He had a 20% bandemia and chest x-ray that showed bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis mainly in the right middle lobe with pulmonary edema.
CT of the abdomen was done, which revealed no active acute bleeding.
However, there were renal hemorrhagic cysts.
On [**9-3**], colonoscopy was performed to look into the source of the GI bleeding and frond-like villous nonbleeding greater than 5 cm mass was found at the hepatic flexure.
The mass caused partial obstruction.
Sleep apnea results stated that no abnormal events occurred during the recording.
Over the past two weeks that has been little change in the myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**].
