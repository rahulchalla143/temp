Admission Date:  [**2163-10-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2163-10-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2101-5-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Known firstname 3556**] Chief Complaint: Hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation attempted Central line placed  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 62 yo M w/PMHx of NSCL and SCC recently admitted at the VA and treated for pneunomia in [**8-/2163**], who presents with hemoptysis of one day's duration.
He relates that he coughed up about 100cc of bright red blood at that time.
In the setting of a recent admission to the [**Hospital **] hospital for a pneumonia, and apparently in light of abnormal findings there, patient underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2163-9-22**] at [**Hospital1 18**] through interventional pulmonology which showed normal upper airways.
The right main stem and right upper lobe were normal and the right lower lobe ended in a large cavity filled with purulent secretions.
Biopsies were taken and eventually showed extremely scant fragments of atypical squamous epithelium and bronchial tissue with necrotic debris and necrotic bronchial cartilage.
Biopsies were also taken and showed scant bronchial tissue and necrotic debris; no viable malignancy was identified.
A CT done on [**9-29**] showed a cavitary lesion continuous with an ulcerated bronchus intermedius.
Notes he did feel SOB, has noted some weight loss and increasing fatigue.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, on 2L home O2 4.
Has prior history of asbestos exposure while working in shipyard for the Navy.
Family History: Father with emphysema and lung cancer.
Physical Exam: Vitals - T 97.2 HR 126, BP 105/65, SaO2 95% on 5L General - Chronically ill, thin male laying in bed, in NAD although occasionally coughing up blood-tingled sputum.
Cardiovascular - Tachycardic, RR, no M/G/R appreciated, hyperdynamic precordium.
Pulmonary - Absent lung sounds over left lung field, no egophony or tactile fremitus noted over right field.
Abdomen - soft, NT, ND, +BS Extremities - warm, well perfused, no clubbing/cyanosis/edema.
Neurology - alert, oriented, no focal deficits.
The reduced FVC is likely due to gas trapping but a coexisting restrictive defect cannot be excluded.
Suggest lung volume measurements if clinically indicated.
There are no prior studies available for comparison.
Cavitary lesion continuous with an ulcerated bronchus intermedius has non-aggressive appearing thickened wall with smooth margins, but a small focus of soft tissue surrounding the right middle lobe bronchus could be tumor.
Focal fibrosis and traction bronchiectasis in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe may be sequelae to radiation therapy.
Severe apical predominant emphysema.
There is persistent left perihilar opacity, which may correspond to a cavitated lesion, seen on the recent CT.
There is no pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
There is increase in interstitial markings above the minor fissure, which may represent early or atypical pneumonia or asymmetric edema.
Interstitial septal thickening due to lymphangitic tumor spread is also in the differential diagnosis.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia @ rate of 128, some TWI in V5, V6, new as compared to [**2162-2-3**] EKG.

In setting of his NSCLC and SCC, it was concerning for several pathologies, including malignancy, malignant erosion into a bronchial blood vessel, infection, AVM/fistula, irritation, or trauma.
On night of admission, interventional pulmonology, thoracic surgery, and interventional radiology all were involved in evaluation of the patient.
Thoracic surgery determined that there was no appropriate surgical intervention.
At the time of initial evaluation, the patient was stable and demonstrated no further evidence of bleeding.
During this time he underwent intubation, central line placement, and fiberoptic bronchoscopy.
Due to the absence of left lung and location of the tumor erosion/cavity, it was not possible to obtain control of the bleeding.
The most likely explanation was that the tumor eroded into the main pulmonary artery.
