Admission Date:  [**2186-7-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2186-7-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2135-4-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Cocaine  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Thoracic back pain and leg weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: T4 laminectomy  History of Present Illness: 51 yo man w/ PMH of esophageal CA s/p chemo and radiation w/ known progressive disease presented to OSH [**7-16**] for evaluation of new onset LE paralysis.
He had upper back pain for 2 days prior to admission.
Over the course of the day he developed RLE weakness and came to the ED for further evaluation.
Team was concerned for spinal cord compression, but could not get MRI as pt has surgical clips after traumatic head injury.
CT myelogram showed occlusion of spinal canal at T4, so taken emergently to OR.
Found epidural abscess, which was washed out.
On POD#2, pt became acute dyspneic and hypoxic to 77% after nasotracheal suctioning.

No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
Cranial Nerves: II: Pupils round and reactive to light w/ mild anisocoria (R>L)  III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements intact bilaterally with few beats of nystagmus, ptosis of L eye V, VII: Facial strength and sensation intact and symmetric.

There is complete block of contrast material at the thoracic [**3-23**] vertebral body level.
The post- myelogram CT of the thoracic and cervical spine reconfirmed that there is complete block of contrast within the subarachnoid space at the T4/5 level.
Bedside Echocardiogram: There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion most prominent anterior to the right atrium with brief right atrial diastolic collapse.
A promient echogenic area is seen overlying the right ventricular free wall which likely represents epicardial fat (cannot exclude thrombus or tumor if this is clinically suggested).
There is but no right ventricular diastolic collapse with relatively minimal fluid anterior to the right ventricle.
There is mild eccentuation of transmitral Doppler E wave suggesting increased pericardial pressure.
Chest CT on [**7-18**] showed debris in the distal L mainstem bronchus consistent with aspirated material.
Brief Hospital Course: 51 yo man with esophageal cancer s/p chemo and XRT presenting with abrupt onset lower extremity flacid paralysis found to have T4 epidural abscess, s/p operative debridement, now with acute onset respiratory distress .
# Respiratory distress: acute dyspnea with severe hypoxemia and tachycardia on HD#3, now maintaining adequate saturation on high flow nebulizer mask.
Ruled out DVT and PE with lower extremity dopplers and CTA.
The combination of locally advanced esophageal cancer and weakened chest muscles leading to poor cough predispose to recurrent, significant aspiration.
This was discussed at length with the patient, and he wishes to continue chest PT and other non-invasive measures to augment his cough and support his breathing.
If non-invasive measures cease to be effective, he has stated clearly that he would want to be made comfortable.
- aggressive chest PT & nebs since cough is very weak due to T4 spinal lesion.
- supplemental O2 as needed to keep SpO2>90%, currently requiring Hi Flow venti mask; titrate up to non rebreather if needed - DNR/DNI; if noninvasive means to support oxygenation are ineffective, pt would want to transition to hospice .
# Pericardial effusion: given cardiomediastinal enlargement on CXR, stat echo was obtained, which showed moderate pericardial effusion with invagination of RA, equivocal respiratory variation of RV movement, but no collapse of RV.
Given low/normal pulsus and no signs of tamponade by echo, this effusion is likely not the cause of his respiratory decompensation.
# T4 epidural abscess: s/p open debridement on [**7-16**], wound cultures growing Strep milleri, but wound GM stain also showed a GM Neg coccobacillus, suspect mouth flora.
After 6 week course is complete, recommend suppressive therapy with amoxicillin 500mg daily indefinitely, as the locally advanced esophageal cancer will remain a risk for thoracic spine infection.
# Esophageal CA: s/p chemo and xrt, with stenting for stenosis.
Pain control.
Patient's goals for treatment have been to be able to eat; oncologist Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] has indicated that further chemo or xrt will likely not help in this regard but continue to follow.
Pain control.
# GERD: continue protonix .
Acetylcysteine 10 % (100 mg/mL) Solution Sig: One (1) ML Miscellaneous Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: esophageal cancer T4 epidural abscess, polymicrobial, with spinal cord compression and paraplegia   Discharge Condition: fair, although with tenuous respiratory status.
Discharge Instructions: You had surgical decompression of a T4 epidural abscess and will need 6 weeks of antibiotics to treat this.
You may or may not regain much motor function in your legs because of the spinal cord compression injury.
For your respiratory status, the combination of esophageal cancer and weakness have predisposed you to aspirating and prevent you from coughing effectively.
Continue with aggressive chest physical therapy and MIE as long as patient feels subjective benefit.
