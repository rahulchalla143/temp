Became lightheaded with the headache but never had LOC.
She did have nausea and one episode of vomitting.
No visual changes.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
Decreased on R, says baseline IX, X: Palatal elevation symmetrical.
No abnormal movements, tremors.

No definite aneurysm seen on CTA.
3.7 x 3.7 rounded dense lesion in right frontal lobe, most probably extraaxial, with minimal mass effect on adjacent sulci, small internal ?calcifcation versus small focus of internal hemorrhage.
Could be consistent with meningioma.

FINDINGS: There continues to be scattered foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage, most notably within the right parietal region, with a small amount of dependent hemorrhage within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles, right greater than left.
No new foci of acute hemorrhage are identified.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus or acute major vascular territorial infarction.
Large hyperdense partially calcified right frontal extra-axial mass with displacement of the falx leftward and associated vasogenic edema is unchanged.
Low- density lesion within the left anterior temporal lobe is unchanged, most likely representing an arachnoid cyst.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated, with the right mastoid air cells being sclerotic.
Unchanged scattered foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage, with a small amount of hemorrhage layering within the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricles.
No change in the right frontal meningioma and left anterior temporal lobe arachnoid cyst.
Non-diagnostic Q waves in the inferior leads.
Diffuse ST-T wave changes which are non-specific.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Sagittal and axial short TR, short TE spin echo imaging were performed through the brain.
FINDINGS: The extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage demonstrated on the CT scans is less apparent on the MR, but is seen as areas of hyperintensity in the sulci on the FLAIR images.
The FLAIR images also reveal small bilateral subdural fluid collections whose signal intensities suggest hematomas.
There is intraventricular blood, as seen on the earlier head CT, but no evidence of new hemorrhage.
The large right frontal meningioma is again identified.
The MRA examination demonstrates no vascular abnormalities.
Specifically, there is no evidence of aneurysm or AVM.
Incidentally noted is a left anterior temporal arachnoid cyst.
Again identified is diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Small subdural hematomas are also seen.
There is a left anterior temporal arachnoid cyst and a large right frontal meningioma that appears to extend through the falx.
Incidentally noted was that she had a Frontal brain mass which as this time is suspected to be a menigioma.
She also has an arachnoid cyst.
She was kept in the ICU until follow up angiogram demonstrated that there was no defined aneurysm identified.
CV;No issues during this stay  ENDO: she had no issues during this stay - she was placed on SSI coverage during the ICU stay.
RESP: No issues  Renal: UTI noted on [**5-17**].

He would like you to have a CTA of the brain prior to your appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] will review the CTA and decide what else, if anything with regards to your subarachnoid hemorrhage needs to be done.
