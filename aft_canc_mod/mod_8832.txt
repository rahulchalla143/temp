At 2:30pm he was noticed to have dysarthria and soon after slumped on the floor, described to have right sided weakness by EMS report.
On the floor he had GTC seizure, he was given 2mg ativan and 5mg valium by EMS with no significant response; BP 100/103 HR 100.
No neurologic exam was documented before he was heavily sedated to confirm right sided weakness reported by history.
Of note, his son reports that patient has had two seizures in his life; one of them when he had a stroke, perioperatively 5 years ago and another one 2 years ago in the setting of hypertensive encephalopathy.

Loss of flow-related enhancement of the distal right vertebral artery extending into the basilar artery, with corresponding increased T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity.
The findings are concerning for a high-grade versus complete stenosis of the basilar artery.
Old left parietal and temporal infarct, with a tiny focus of decreased diffusion along its anterior margin that may represent a tiny acute component.
However, there is no other area of definite decreased diffusion, with no evidence of infarct in the brainstem.
Extensive white matter hyperintensity, some of which correlates with the chronic infarct, while the remainder is in a nonspecific distribution, likely representing the sequela of chronic microangiopathy given the patient's age.
CXR - IMPRESSION: Multifocal lung opacities, the larger one is located in the left upper lobe.
..............   Brief Hospital Course: 74 year old man with PMH of L parietal stroke (perioperative during AVR replacment [**2128**]), prostate ca s/p radiation therapy, afib off coumadin for the past few days due to hematuria (INR subtherapeutic 1.2), hx a. comm aneurysm, and two previous episodes of seizures (first in the setting of his stroke and second in the setting of hypertensive encephalopathy), who was noted to have started talking "gibberish and was confused" while getting a hair cut, attempted to get out of chair but was unsteady with EMS called and noted to slump to one side and have a "GTC" He was treated with ativan/valim and transferred to ED at [**Hospital1 18**] where he was intubated and had an episode of hypotension to 80s.
1) Neuro:  He underwent a CT head revealing no new pathology and EEG revealing mild encephalopathy.
On HD#1 patient was noted to have multiple episodes of low amplitude high frequency R > L extremities shaking with extensor posturing.
He did not have further seizures on continuous EEG monitoring for the next two days.
Given being off anticoagulation, there was concern for an embolic stroke, leading to a GTC.
He underwent an MRI/a of the brain which showed a low flow at R vertebral and basilar, no infarction in the brainstem and the old L parietal/temporal infarct with chronic WMD.
At this time, he was started on heparin gtt for atrial fibrillation.
Echocardiogram showed no evidence of an embolus.
Over HD#[**11-28**] patient was noted to have significant autonomic instabilty (HTN, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxemia) along with low amplitude high frequency R > L extremities shaking with extensor posturing.
Given hx of exposure to two doses of celexa an having taken Ginko Biloba as a supplement, along with fluctuating examination of increased LE tone, hyperreflexia and intermittent clonus > UE, a dx of serotonin syndrom was considered, however, the exam was fluctuating and patient also had an underlying PNA, which were felt to be the better explanations for his symptoms, including possible temporary basilar insufficiency, leading to b/l pontine symptoms (in addition patient had disconjugate eye movements in vertical and horizontal directions)  On [**2134-11-7**] the patient began to be much more responsive and beagn to follow simple midline and appendicular commands.
His neurologic exam on day of transfer was also significant for residual right-sided hemiparesis from his prior stroke.
Heme: On [**2134-11-7**] the patient was noted to have become hypotensive and began to require pressors.
At the same time his abdomen had become distended and tense.
A CT scan was ordered and the patient was found to have had a large left sided RP bleed.
2) CV: Atrial fibrillation with intermittent hypertension to 180s systolic.
TTE showed LAD, EF 50-55% with mild dilatation and mild aortic root dilatation with 2+MR, 3+ severe TR, and significant PR.
ROMI was completed, with peak troponin of 0.05, felt to be due to renal failure and w/o ekg correlate.
He was found to have a LUL PNA on CXR, along with WBC/tachypnea and respiratory distress, for which he was empirically treated with Vanco/Zosyn, which was narrowed to Levofloxacin after organism on sputum was identified as MSSA.
With his bleeding he again spiked fevers and his antibiotic coverage was expanded to Vanco/Zosyn.
Creatinine peaked at 2.4 and noted to have granular casts on microscopic exam suggesting ATN.
However his renal function again deteriorated when he became hypotensive and was having blood loss.
In addition his abdominal pressure was increased also contributing to renal dysfunction.
5)ID: Fever on admission to 105.6F and febrile through HD# 5 to 102F.
He was noted to have an LUL infiltrate on CXR and was treated for HAP as above, then narrowed to coverage for MSSA.
took one dose of Celexa stopped due to dizziness Pt.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Simethicone 80 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for flatulence.
HydrALAzine 15 mg IV Q4H:PRN If SBP>180   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Seizure Atrial fibrillation Pneumonia History of left parietal stroke 5 years ago   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Awake, alert.
Neuro exam is significant for mild dysarthria, motor weakness throughout (R>L), and has right pronator drift.
You were started on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
You were treated for antibiotics for pneumonia.
You had bleeding within your abdomen and you required blood transfusion.
