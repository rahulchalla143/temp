Adjacent to this is a small well-circumscribed lobulated echogenic lesion measuring 2.3 x 1.9 cm, which appears most consistent with a hemangioma.
Smaller cyst and adjacent 1-cm similar echogenic lesion most consistent with hemangioma are also seen in the medial aspect of the right lobe of the liver.
There is no biliary ductal dilatation.
There is a small amount of ascites seen around the liver, and in the lower pelvis.
Large simple cyst is seen in the right kidney measuring 3.7 x 2.0 x 3.4 cm.
A smaller adjacent 1.7-cm simple cyst is also seen in the mid pole of the right kidney.
Both kidneys are otherwise normal in appearance, without evidence of mass, stone, or hydronephrosis.
Multiple liver cysts and likely hemangiomas.
Small volume ascites around the liver, and in the lower pelvis.
Right renal cysts.
Marked prostatic enlargement, bulging into the posterior aspect of the bladder.
TTE The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler (does not exclude).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension most likely due to a primary pulmonary process.
Interatrial septal aneurysm.
VIDEO SWALLOW INDICATION: 57-year-old man with Zenker's diverticulum and aspiration pneumonia.
FINDINGS: Oropharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed today in corroboration with speech pathology.
PHARYNGEAL PHASE: Swallow initiation, palatal elevation, laryngeal elevation, laryngeal valve closures, and epiglottic deflection were within functional limits.
ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: No penetration or aspiration during the swallow, however, penetration was seen after the swallow from backflow from the diverticulum to the pharynx.
IMPRESSION: Penetration resulting from backflow from the large esophageal diverticulum, likely Zenker's, otherwise functional oral and pharyngeal swallow.
The diverticulum could be formally evaluated with barium swallow if clinically indicated and no prior studies performed.
>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..   Brief Hospital Course: 77M PMH myelofibrosis and resulting anemia p/w witnessed aspiration event and hypoxia.
# Aspiration pneumonia Pt developed fever, bandemia, bilateral infiltrates on CXR in the setting of a witness aspiration event during blood transfusion.
On the medical floor he triggered for sudden episode of hypoxia and required intubation in the MICU for < 24 hrs.
He was considered to have aspiration pneumonia, however trali and transfusion related volume overload were also considered.
Since the story was very classic for aspiration and initial cxr did not support TRALI, transfusion reaction was thought not to be likely at all.
# Zenker's diverticulum Patient has been considered to have a ZD given history of coughing up regurgited foods after eating.
He was evaluated with speech and swallow, and a large diverticulum was discovered.
In the meanwhile, he was counseled to eat thickened foods and chew carefully as per S+S reccs to limit his risk of recurrent aspiration.
# Anemia Pt of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3638**], and developed aspiration in the setting getting his first blood transfusions for transfusion dependent myelofibrosis.
His full diagnosis remains unclear, as he does have a 20 q deletion which is sometimes seen in lyphomas and repeat bone marrow has been deferred.
He was thought not to have RBC lysis, but a component of sequestration from his hepato-splenomegaly was thought to contribute as well to anemia.
# Bacteremia His blood culture on admission showed Bacillus not anthraxis.
# Staph in urine culture This was considered also to be a contaminant, as his blood cultures were negative and UA at the time was bland.
# Hypernatremia Pt remained very thirsty and he develped hyrpernatremia in the setting of poor free water access.
# SOB / CHF Patient complained of orthopnea.
Several weeks prior to admission he reported leg and scrotal edema.
BNP was elevated (could be pneumonia as well).
A TTE was checked, which showed moderate pulmonary hypertension and preserved EF.
# Pruritis Continued sarna lotion.
# Liver dysfunction / Coagulopathy Increased INR / PTT, low albumin.
This was considered [**1-26**] to 1) right sided CHF and 2) likely infiltration with underlying hematologic disorder.
Outpatient Physical Therapy   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Aspiration Pneumonia Esophageal Diverticulum Dysphagia Transfusion depended myelofibrosis Bacillus Bacteremia NOS Staph UTI Chronic diastolic heart failure Depression Transient fecal incontinence NOS Pseuodogout   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for a blood transfusion.
You were found to have a pouch in your throat which makes it hard for you to completely swallow you food.
You were found to have pneumonia most likely due to food from the pouch in your throat traveling into your lungs.
