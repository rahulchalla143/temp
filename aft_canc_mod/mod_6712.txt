Admission Date:  [**2199-2-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-3-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2130-8-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 45**] Chief Complaint: Afib with RVR  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2199-3-7**] - Bilateral nephrostomy tube replacement   History of Present Illness: 68M with hx of metastatic prostate cancer c/b obstructive uropathy requiring nephrostomy tube placement ([**11-29**]) who was sent to the ED today after developing anxiety, tachycardia, and AMS in the setting of chemotherapy.
The pt presented to [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] 9 today for round 2 of Taxotere chemotherapy.
At the completion of Taxotere infusion, the pt began to complain of severe sudden anxiety and pruritis.
30 minutes later the patient again began to c/o anxiety and became agitated.
He denied CP or SOB.
CXR showed increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs, potentially due to interstitial edema with more discrete consolidation at the lung bases, potentially atelectasis however developing infiltrate could also be considered.
Head CT with no acute intracranial process.
No large mass or edema to suggest intracranial metastatic disease.
Small foci of air in the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal soft tissues of unclear clinical significance.
He denied CP, SOB, though later did endorse some baseline sob and left lower chest pressure, along with chronic lower abdominal pain.
Of note, the pt was recently admitted to BIDN [**1-9**] for pyelonephritis and enterococcus bacteremia - ultimately treated with ciprofloxacin for a 2wk course with subsequent nephrostomy tube change [**2199-1-15**].
He also experienced several episodes of afib with RVR requiring dilt gtt, and his home metoprolol tartrate was uptitrated to TID.
He reports to me that he is SOB with exertion but this is unchanged.
He thinks that it is secondary to his atrial fibrillation.
He does not have SOB at rest.
No chest pain or tightness.
+ nausea with emesis today but it has since resolved.
No abdominal pain.
He had diarrhea with chemotherapy but it resolved one week ago.
In terms of recent events all he remembers is tell the RN in clinic that he felt wierd and confused then remembers waking up in the ICU with all of his family around him.

Imaging:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2199-2-28**] 4:35 PM IMPRESSION: Increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs, potentially due to interstitial edema with more discrete consolidation at the lung bases, potentially atelectasis however developing infiltrate could also be considered.
No acute intracranial process.
No large mass or edema to suggest intracranial metastatic disease, but MRI is more sensitive.
Small foci of air in the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal soft tissues of unclear clinical significance.
There is no adjacent edema to suggest infection, but it is possible this is tracking from a region that is outside of the field of view.
Alternatively, it may represent foci of air within small veins from intravenous injections.
TTE ([**2199-3-5**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
The LV ejection fraction appears markedly depressed (20 percent) secondary to a combination of atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate, ventricular interaction with a pressure- and volume-overloaded right ventricle, and possible intrinsic left ventricular contractile dysfunction.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
A small posterior pericardial effusion is present.
There is no sign of cardiac tamponade.
Bilateral hydroureter and mild fullness of the right collecting system.
Renal US ([**2199-3-9**]): Slightly contracted kidneys, without evidence of hydronephrosis.
Brief Hospital Course: 68M with hx of metastatic prostate cancer c/b obstructive uropathy requiring bilat nephrostomy tubes, COPD, CAD s/p NSTEMI, severe pulm HTN, h/o dCHF with newly depressed EF who was sent to the ED after developing anxiety, tachycardia, and AMS in the setting of chemotherapy  # Afib with RVR (not anticoagulated): He is not anticoagulated because of a history of severe GI bleeding.
He was subsequently transferred to the oncology service where his HR remained elevated in the 130-150 range.
The diltiazem was subsequently discontinued when he was found to have a depressed EF, as discussed below.
At this time, he was transferred to the cardiology service for further management of his Afib with RVR.
Given that he is not anticoagulated, there is a risk of stroke with chemical cardioversion.
The feeling was that with his depressed EF to 20%, the benefits of controlling his Afib outweighed the risks of storoke.
We did not pursue pre-amiodarone lung function tests or thyroid tests given that his prognosis is poor and the lung/liver/thyroid toxicity from amiodarone are a concern with longer-term theray.
He remained in NSR with HR in the 110-120s at discharge, which we are tolerating until he is loaded with amiodarone for rhythm and rate control.
He cannot tolerate the addition of a calcium channel blocker given his low EF and is on max dose of metoprolol.
# Anxiety/AMS: The patient developed anxiety and subsequent confusion/combatitiveness after the completion of chemotherapy.
This initial anxiety/pruritis was likely the result of an infusion reaction from his chemotherapy.
The pt had a CT head in the ED that ruled out acute bleed.
He was monitored overnight in the ICU and his altered mental status improved significantly back to his baseline.
# Acute systolic CHF and chronic diastolic CHF: The most recent TTE prior to admission showed a preserved EF of >55% in 9/[**2198**].
In [**2194**], he was noted to have an EF ranging from 10-30% int he setting of poorly rate controlled AF, tought to be tachyarrhythmia induced cardiomyopathy.
TTE this admission showed a significantly reduced EF of 20%, which is likely from ongoing Afib with RVR.
[**Name2 (NI) **] appeared only mildly volume overloaded on exam and was satting well on room air.
# Neutropenia: After transfer to the cardiology service and approximately 7-8 days after his second cycle of doectaxel, his WBC trended down with an ANC nadir of 325 on [**3-8**].
He remained afebrile this admission.
Of note, the patient was admtited to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] in [**12/2198**] with Enterococcal sepsis and pyelonephritis which was treated with Cipro for 2 weeks.
# Acute on chronic renal failure:  Baseline Cr unclear, no old labs in our records, appears to range from 1.6-2.6 in [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] records.
Repeat renal US after the procedure showed resolution of hydronephrosis and proper tube positioning, his Cr was trending down.
# Metastatic prostate cancer.
Palliative care was consulted during this admission because the patient has advanced malignancy and didn't seem to fully understand the severity of his disease.
He became very upset when discussing the possibility of hospice and other end of life care.
His pain was controlled with oxycodone, tylenol, Lidoderm patch.
--Inactive issues--  # CAD: Fixed defect on [**2195**] P-MIBI although no history of cardiac intervention.
Also has h/o NSTEMI in setting of a prior GI bleed.
He had no anginal symptoms this admission.
#Code status this admission: FULL CODE (confirmed with patient)  #Transitional issues -Will have Chem-7 checked Thursday [**2199-3-15**] at rehab to monitor lytes and BUN/Cr, results faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] (PCP) -Tolerating HR up to the 130s if he is asymptomatic, he is in the process of being loaded with amiodarone for rhytm control -Urine output has been low since he is recovering from obstructive uropathy after his nephrostomy tubes were displaced, he has been making 200-500cc urine per day, left nephrostomy tube always makes more than right -Will need repeat TTE after HR well controlled to assess for recovery of systolic function -Patient was not requiring a fentanyl patch at discharge, pain was controlled with oxycodone, tylenol and Lidoderm patch.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] LivingCenter - [**Location (un) 1411**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate Acute systolic heart failure Chronic diastolic heart failure  Secondary diagnoses: Metastatic prostate cancer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],  It was a pleasure taking care of you during your admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for rapid heart rate.
You had atrial fibrillation with a rapid heart rate.
We discussed with you that while there is a risk of stroke by converting you from atrial fibrillation into regular rhythm without blood thinners, however our team felt this was the best option for managing your fast heart rate after discussing with you, your daughter, your cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5858**], and your oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Your creatinine (measure of kidney function) also mildly increased after this obstruction resolved and is now downtrending.
