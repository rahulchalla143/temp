There was one pushbutton activation without a clear electrographic correlate.
Automated sampling captured some of the sharper alpha which correlated with the patient's electrographic events.
EEG [**2176-7-27**]: This is an abnormal continuous video EEG given the presence of brief subclinical electrographic seizures over the right greater than left frontal leads.
There is a significant reduction to no seizures appreciated after the morning hours.
There was one pushbutton activation without a clear electrographic correlate.
EEG [**2176-7-29**]: This is an abnormal continuous video EEG given the presence of burst of bilateral frontal and temporal generalized slowing.
There were no electrographic seizures detected.
10 x 6 mm enhancing lesion in the right frontal lobe, with central intrinsic T1-hyperintensity, "blooming" susceptibility and adjacent filamentous vascular structures extending to the nearby dura.
Taken together, these findings suggest hemorrhage related to underlying cavernous angioma with possible associated developmental venous anomaly.
A more remote possibility is dural AV fistula, with cortical venous drainage.
Expanded sella turcica, with an appearance suggestive of an "empty sella," a common variant, or possibly, arachnoid cyst of the suprasellar cistern.
CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM [**2176-7-29**]: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 13712**] underwent a diagnostic cerebral angiogram which was grossly normal, specifically with no evidence of a dural arteriovenous fistula.
Limited pre-operative study redemonstrating the 7 x 7 mm enhancing lesion in the right frontal region consistent with the previously-characterized cavernous angioma, unchanged in appearance since [**2176-7-26**].
HEAD CT [**2176-7-31**]: No evidence of postoperative hemorrhage.
HEAD CT [**2176-8-4**]: No evidence of interval hemorrhage from [**2176-7-31**].
HEAD CT [**2176-8-8**]: Expected evolution of postoperative bed in the right frontal lobe.
No evidence of new hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: 53 yo RH F who p/w new onset seizure, found to have R frontal cavernoma.
# Neuro: Patient presented with seizure and found to have right frontal cavernoma, which was the likely cause of her seizures.
On admission, patient was noted to be confused and lethargic, and EEG revealed that she was still having seizures while on Dilantin.
Post op course was complicated by continued headache, but repeat head CTs only showed expected post op changes and no hemorrhages.
# CV: She was continued on telemetry without events, and her lipid panel showed slightly elevated LDL, but given no other risk, she was recommended lifestyle changes for now.
# ID: Patient developed fevers during her post op period, and was started on IV vancomycin for a few days.
# GI: patient suffered from constipation, likely from decreased mobility and narcotics during her post op period.
Her constipation improved with increased bowel regimen.
# HEME: patient developed progressive anemia after her surgery for unclear reason.
Iron studies were done and did not show iron deficiency.
Magnesium Citrate 300 mL PO PRN constipation 8.
You were admitted to the hospital because you had a seizure and then in the ED, you were found to have a cavernoma in your brain.
