The patient was found to have a sodium of 120, and after IVFs with the thought the patient was slightly hypovolemic given his low BP, the Na was 116.
The patient was very anxious and agitated today as well.
He denies nausea or vomiting, but does report mild diarrhea from the chemo.

No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
It was felt that he had SIADH, given that his hyponatremia worsened initially with intravenous fluids, his low urine osmolality, and his euvolemic state.
Due to his known brain metastases and concern over worsening edema and risk of seizures, he was treated with keppra and steroids to minimize the edema and seizure risk.
# Small cell lung cancer: Patient had recently completed cycle 1 of cisplatin and irinotecan on day of admission.
- He was continued on keppra and steroids, which were slowly tapered down, for his known brain metastases.
- His chemotherapy was held due to continued diarrhea and neutropenia.
- Patient was neutropenic, but his cell counts trended upward prior to discharge and he was no longer neutropenic at that time.
He had no fevers or signs of infection while neutropenic.
# Diarrhea: The patient noted diarrhea that was worst during his first few days of hospitalization.
Studies for c. difficile were negative, and his diarrhea was managed with immodium as needed.
# Bipolar disorder/Anxiety:  Depakote had been discontinued 1 week prior admission due to concern over possible interaction with chemotherapy.
Although hyponatremia was felt to have some role in the patient's agitation, it was also possible that the discontinuation of depakote was also playing a role.
# Hyperglycemia: Patient was noted to have elevated blood sugars, which were felt to likely be secondary to steroids.
# Thrush: Patient noted to have thrush, thought to be secondary to steroids.
# Prophylaxis:   - Proton pump inhibitor was initiated due to steroid use.
