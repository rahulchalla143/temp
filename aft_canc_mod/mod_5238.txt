Decreased tree-in-[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 239**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 75026**] in the lungs bilaterally, most likely due to an improving diffuse small airways infection.
Tumor dissemination could have this appearance; however the diffuse and relatively homogeneous distribution suggests infection rather than malignancy.
No CT findings of radiation pneumonitis.
Slightly enlarged 17mm hepatic hypodensity incompletely assessed on this exam or the prior CT and further assessment should be obtained with MRI to assess for metastasis.
Barium Swallow ([**2101-7-18**]) Delayed passage of thick barium and a barium tablet in the midesophagus.
While it does not meet all radiologic criteria it likely represents a mild stricture as the patient reports dysphagia in this location.
CXR ([**2101-7-23**]): Worsening airspace consolidation at the right lung base which could reflect worsening pneumonia, although the pulmonary vasculature looks more ill-defined and therefore superimposed edema should also be considered.
There continues to be a small right pleural effusion, but now visualized is a small left effusion as well.
No pneumothorax.

An underlying infection was ruled out initially and the patient was encouraged to take good PO.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU on [**2101-7-15**] after triggering for desaturations, tachypnea and nursing concerns about her mental status.
Subsequent CXRs showed a RLL pneumonia which was treated with vancomycin, aztreonam (due to PCN allergy) and levofloxacin.
The patient will continue aztreonam and vancomycin for a total of 14 days (until [**7-29**]), for pseudomonas and staph coag positive culture data (sputum), organisms are sensitive to these antibiotics.
# COPD/cough: The patient was given steroids and azithromycin in the ED for possible excacerbation, but given the fact that she initially denied having any shortness of breath, steroids and antibiotics were initially held.
There were no acute changes in her CXR and a CT chest was also done that showed no evidence of radiation pneumonitis.
During the hospitalization, the patient reported episodes of subjective SOB, as well as coughing, and she was started on a brief course of prednisone 40 mg daily.
Given the patient's pneumonia and respiratory comprimise during her stay, it was hypothesized that her PNA was exacerbating her COPD.
Given her radiation therapy, differential can include esophagitis versus stricture formation.
She was also started on sucralfate, Maalox, and Roxicet as needed for the dysphagia.
These symptoms should be followed up as an outpatient.
#Anxiety: patient has significant anxiety episodes where she becomes tachycardic and tachypnic.
She developed a significant Ativan requirement while on the floor.
She was also started on Metoprolol for her tachycardic episodes (see below).
#Intermittent Afib vs frequent atrial ectopy: On approximately [**7-22**], the patient had an episode of tachycardia to 140-150.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: The patient presented with a creat of 1.3, which was likely elevated in the settting of hypovolemia and decreased PO intake.
# Loose stools: The patient has had intermittent frequent loose stools throughout the hospitalization, perhaps secondary to abx usage.
While she was in patient, her counts started dropping in the setting of her recent chemo.
She became neutropenic, as well.
Her fourth cycle of chemotherapy was on hold secondary to her acute illness.
