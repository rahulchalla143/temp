Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears grossly normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is no evidence of pericardial constriction.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
No valvular pathology identified.
No evidence for pericardial disease.
Improved left and upper lobe consolidation, likely reflective of aspiration and atelectasis.
Mild pulmonary edema.
CXR [**10-20**]: Over the past 24 hours, consolidation in the left upper lobe and previous moderate left pleural effusion have improved substantially.
Region of right lower lobe consolidation has worsened slightly since [**10-18**].
Mediastinal widening in the region of the aortic arch is attributable to adenopathy.
Right internal jugular line is just above the estimated location of the superior cavoatrial junction.
Small right pleural effusion remains.
CXR [**10-22**]: IMPRESSION: Slightly increased moderate left pleural effusion.
There is currently unchanged appearance of the widened left mediastinum.
Left retrocardiac consolidation and left pleural effusion are unchanged.
The perihilar opacity has slightly increased in the interim and might potentially represent area of atelectasis, although hemorrhage as well as aspiration cannot be entirely excluded.
FNA FLOW CYTOMETRY [**10-18**]: INTERPRETATION Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by non-Hodgkin lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
However, there are clusters of highly atypical cells on the cytospin preparation, which are highly suspicious for involvement by a non-hematologic malignant neoplasm.
Refer to concurrent surgical pathology report (S10-[**Numeric Identifier **]) for final diagnosis.
Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas as due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.
Level 7 lymph node, EBUS-TBNA, cell block      Metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma.
The cytomorphologic and immunophenotypic findings are consistent with metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma; the tumor cannot be further classified in this sample.

Regarding cancer risk patient with 14 pack year history of tobacco as well as h/o of Hodgkins disease s/p Mantle radiation in the [**2132**].
The patient was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in [**2141**] and treated with splenectomy and thoracic mantle radiotherapy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 2025**].
He has since had no evidence of disease, and flow cytometry on [**2173-9-28**] revealed no evidence of lymphoma.
Regarding immediate history prior to this presentation patient developed shortness of breath in mid-[**Month (only) **], was started on Flovent by his primary care physician.
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2173-10-16**], he coughed up sputum with streaks of blood, and the following day had an episode of hemoptysis measuring one cup.
CTA of the chest showed no pulmonary embolism, but revealed a large density involving the majority of the left upper lobe, likely representing pulmonary hemorrhage.
It also showed a left lower lobe consolidation and an adjacent paramediastinal area of heterogeneous attenuation with adjacent focal narrowing of the left pulmonary artery apical segmental branch to the lower lobe.
There was also a 2-cm subcarinal node and a 0.9-cm node adjacent to the left mainstem bronchus.
Initial bronchoscopy reportedly revealed a protruding lesion with intraluminal and extraluminal component in the left lower lobe, but there is no offical report of this, and no biopsies were taken.
Rigid bronchoscopy on [**2173-10-18**] showed slow oozing of bright red blood from the apical posterior segment of the left upper lobe and an enlarged subcarinal lymph node.
Biopsy of the left upper lobe revealed scant strips of benign respiratory epithelium and fibrinous exudate and clot with acute and chronic inflammation.
Flow cytometry revealed no lymphoma, but showed clusters of highly atypical cells on the cytospin, suspicious for a non-hematologic malignancy.
Biopsy results of the enlarged subcarinal lymph node + non-small cell lung cancer (Immunohistochemical stains show that tumor cells stain positive for cytokeratin cocktail (AE1/3 and CAM 5.2), cytokeratin 7 and TTF-1.
The cytomorphologic and immunophenotypic findings are consistent with metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma; the tumor cannot be further classified in this sample).
The patient underwent IR embolization of right bronchial artery branches on [**2173-10-18**], and IR embolization of left bronchial, intercostal, and internal mammary branches on [**2173-10-19**].
Further staging was performed including CT chest, abd, pelvis, MRI head and brain - which were negative for metastasis.
US guided thoracentisis performed on day prior to discharge to determine presence of malignany effusion as well as further delinate adenocarcinoma vs squamous cell carcinoma.
# Pulmonary embolism, DVT s/p IVC filterplacement.
On patient with complaint of area of induration on posterior right leg on [**10-29**].
CT with non-occlusive thrombis within the right pulmonary artery.
Decision made to place permanent filter due to inability to anti-coagulate.
Patient did demonstrate intermittent sinus tachycardia to 130s with exertion though likely manifestation of pulmonary embolism.
No document hypoxia on the floor.
# GI Bleed.
GI [**Month/Day (4) 4221**] due to several episodes of dark tarry stool as well as bright red blood per rectum.
During hospitalization, shortly after extubation, patient with several episodes of small volume loose black, sticky foul smelling stool.
Additionally, on [**2173-10-25**], he began having loose stools with bright red blood surrounding his stool, last BRB bowel movement this AM.
He has some anal discomfort but no abdominal pain.
Denies nausea, vomitting, or persistent reflux.
Last episode of hemoptysis was [**2173-10-24**] and patient remembers swallowing a large amount of blood at that point.
He denies a history of hematochezia, melena, hemaetemesis prior to admission.
Prior to admission bowel movements were regular (occuring once daily), no change in caliber, brown and formed, no abdominal pain with bowel movements.
Patient underwent EGD which was negative - dark stools thought secondary to aspirated blood, Colonscopy demonstrated 2 small poylps in the rectum s/p polypectomy.
Circumferential area in rectum of ulceration, erythema and friability of unknown significance.
Rectum (biopsy): Fragments of colonic/rectal mucosa with focal, sharply demarcated ulceration, fibrinopurulent exudate and adjacent crypt regeneration; No diagnostic features of chronic colitis, granulomata or viral inclusions are identified.
NSAID's) or, less likely, ischemic injury, among other etiologies.
Babesiosis: Pt with severe prior infection and PCR from [**9-28**] was negative.
No evidence that babesiosis is related to his hemoptysis.
Urinary retention.
Patient noted to have hematuria in MICU which was deemed traumatic bleeding in the setting of foley placement.
No further episodes of hematuria in house however initial concern for metastatic disease to spine in setting of new retention.
Did endorse some urinary discomfort, no overt dysuria.
[**Month (only) 116**] benefit from urology follow-up as outpatient if symptoms do not improve.
ECG changes: On admission to MICU ECG demonstrates less then 1mm ST elevations diffusely.
Patient without anginal complaints in house.
Patient started on levofloxacin due to concern for pneumonia in asplenic patient.
On day 5 patient developed pruritic urtical rash on back.
On [**10-27**], final day of ceftrixone, patient developed pruritic, urticaral rash on trunk and upper and lower bilateral extremities.
This was likely due to sedation, but concern for sepsis prompted ICU team to empirically cover with vanco/cefepime to cover encapsulated organisms due to patient asplenic status.
Home atenolol held in house and throughout remainder of stay  on the floor patient normotensive without anti-hypertensives.
