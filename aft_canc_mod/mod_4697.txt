Barium passed freely through the oropharynx without evidence of obstruction.
Mild penetration was seen with rapid swallows of thin barium; otherwise, there is no evidence of aspiration.

There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Little change in bilateral pleural effusions with retrocardiac opacity.
Superimposed consolidation at the lung bases cannot be excluded.

There is a bioprosthesis located in the aortic position.
There is trace, central valvular aortic regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was initially admitted to cardiology service after being seen at OSH for chest pain and dyspnea.
An echo showed aortic stenosis and she was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
Epiaortic duplex scanning.
The patient woke from anesthesia with tachycardia and hypertension and was resedated.
Over the next few days she remained hemodynamically stable but had generalized complains aof pain with some localization to the abdomen.
She extubated the day after surgery but remained in the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring.
During this time she had several episodes of atrial fibrillation and was treated with Beta blockers, amiodarone and anticoagulation.
She was very deconditioned and her activity was minimal in this initial period, she failed a swallow evaluation and a feeding tube was placed.
Once on the floor she was started on some oral nutrition and appeared to have aspirated, with a leukocytosis and chest XRay the revealed a right lower lobe infiltrate.
She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and her leukocytosis gradually resolved.
ON POD 18 she was transferred to rehabilitation at Life Care Center of [**Location (un) **] for continued recovery.
