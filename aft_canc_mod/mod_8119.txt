Pt went to rad/onc today for XRT and was found to be febrile to 101, and with increased work of breathing.
He appeared ill, seemed to be in respiratory distress but thought to be mostly upper airway.
He was self-suctioning CXR with possible vascular congestion and infiltrate on oxygen 4LNC, 94%.
He is being transferred to the ICU for frequent suctioning, support, and for close monitoring.
Pt was recently admitted from [**2155-8-22**] to [**2155-10-22**] with new diagnosis of squamous cell hypopharnygeal mass, complicated by respiratory distress from his mass, HCAP, intubated for prolonged period and extubated [**2155-10-8**], fungal pericarditis on fluconazole, and hypertensive urgency.
Though pt denies fever, chills, sweats, chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark or bloody stools.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.

It does not extend across the rib cage.
There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular blurring.
There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
A catheter or other tube overlies the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
No pneumothorax is detected.
No pneumothorax is detected.
Compared with [**2155-11-7**], there has been slight interval clearing at the left base laterally.
There is persistent left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, with increased retrocardiac density and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.
There is focal opacity in the right cardiophrenic region, raising question of a possible small hernia, unchanged.
Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with probable elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
Extensive retrocardiac opacification could reflect merely volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion.
No evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
Retrocardiac opacification may reflect merely volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion.
Fracture of the proximal humerus on the left is again seen.
The left internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC.
Left retrocardiac consolidation is unchanged.
No appreciable pneumothorax is seen.
Right basal and left retrocardiac opacities can be also appreciated on the chest CT obtained on [**2155-11-4**] and are concerning for multifocal infection.
[**2155-11-5**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Previous pulmonary edema on [**11-3**] has improved, but there is multifocal infection, demonstrated to better advantage on yesterday's chest CT scan concerning for pneumonia, with demonstration of heavy retained secretions in the airways, particularly the bronchus to the collapsed left lower lobe.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are more obvious on the CT scan.
Infiltrative tumor in the post-cricoid region involving the right hypopharynx, incompletely assessed in this CT study but appearing smaller compared to the recent study.
Likely infiltrative process to the right thyroid cartilage.
Moderate retained fluid in the posterior oro- and nasopharynx, secondary to intubation.
Heavy bronchial secretions occlude the left lower lobe bronchus and severely narrow the left upper.
Multifocal pneumonia, presumably related to difficulty clearing secretions.
Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions layering nonhemorrhagic and decreased since [**9-24**].

[**2155-11-4**] CHEST PORT.
Dense left lower lung atelectasis and effusion and right lower lung opacity consistent with aspiration are unchanged.
No pneumothorax is seen with normal cardiac size and mediastinal contours.
The known opacity at the right lung base, suggestive of aspiration pneumonia, is unchanged in extent and severity.
Also unchanged is the left retrocardiac atelectasis and a minimal left pleural effusion.
No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
[**2155-11-4**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): As compared to the previous radiograph, the size of the cardiac silhouette and the mild retrocardiac atelectasis are unchanged.
There also is unchanged blunting of the costophrenic sinus on the left, suggesting presence of a small pleural effusion.
On the right, the pre-existing opacities have slightly decreased in extent and severity and now more concentrated in the medial basal parts of the right lower lung.
The location of these opacities suggests aspiration pneumonia rather than pulmonary edema.
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.

Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
Small left pleural effusion with retrocardiac opacity that likely represents compressive atelectasis.
[**2155-11-3**] ECG Sinus tachycardia.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 4427**] is a 67M with history of alcohol abuse, BCC, fungal pericarditis, hypopharyngeal cancer currently undergoing XRT who presents with fevers, respiratory distress and transferred to the ICU for close monitoring, ultimately found to have aspiration pneumonia from difficult to manage secretions and was intubated for airway protection and is now s/p tracheostomy placement.
# Respiratory distress, airway compromise: Likely secondary to difficult to manage secretions, hypopharyngeal mass and likely aspiration PNA.
Pt had sufficient O2 sats on nasal cannula on admission, but was having difficulty clearing secretions.
ENT was consulted given concern for airway edema and possible obstruction.
ABG showed slight hypercarbia but sufficient oxygenation.
Given his clinical picture and difficult to manage secretions with evidence of possible aspiration pneumonia on CXR, he was intubated on HD#1 for airway protection with the fiberoptic scope.
CT chest showed heavy bronchial secretions occluding the left lower lobe bronchus and severely narrow the left upper.
There was also evidence of multifocal pneumonia.
He was treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl for an 8 day total course ([**11-3**] - [**11-10**]) and continued on fluconazole which was started for fungal pericarditis (below) which should be continued through [**2155-11-26**].
ENT saw evidence of possible fungal laryngitis on laryngoscopic exam, and he will be sufficiently covered by his current fluconazole course.
# Aspiration pneumonia: Patient presented with fevers to 101 at [**Hospital3 **] likely related to aspiration PNA vs HCAP.
Most likely aspiration PNA given fevers, copious secretions, and difficulty protecting airway in the context of his pharyngeal mass and radiation treatment.
CXR suggested possible infiltrate on admission and CT chest confirmed multifocal consolidations.
Pt was started on IV Vanc/Zosyn at rehab on [**11-2**] and was transitioned to Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl to cover for aspiration PNA and completed an 8 day total course ([**11-3**] - [**11-10**]).
Blood cultures sent from [**Hospital1 1319**] grew MRSA and MRSA later grew in endotrachial sputum cultures.
This was felt to be likely due to MRSA colonization.
He was also continued on fluconazole for fungal pericarditis (below), which will also cover for possible fungal laryngitis appreciated on ENT laryngoscopic exam (should continue taking through [**2155-11-26**]).
# Encephalopathy, agitation, myoclonic jerks: On the evening of admission, pt became agitated and confused in the ICU.
This was thought likely to be due to delirium given multiple factors including disturbance in sleep-wake cycle, infection, and concern for possible seizures given myoclonic movements.
EEG was performed on previous admission which revealed generalized slowing, but no seizure activity.
Multiple episodes of limb jerking were captured and there was no EEG correlate.
His acute encephalopathy resolved and returned to baseline mental status which is alert and oriented x 3.
# Hypopharyngeal SCC: Currently on XRT, though held on day of admission.
In consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the decision was made to hold off on additional chemotherapy due to pancytopenia.
# Fungal pericarditis: Pleural effusion and pericardial tissue, but not pericardial effusion cultures from [**2155-9-29**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] sensitive to fluconazole.
Repeat TTE here showed findings consistent with constriction but only mild pericardial effusion.
# MRSA bacteremia: Positive blood cultures at [**Hospital3 **], growing MRSA in 1 out of 4 bottles.
Possible sources include multifocal pneumonia, osteomyelitis given prior humerus fracture, though these all seem unlikely.
TTE was negative for vegetations and TEE deferred given low concern for endocarditis and negative surveillance cultures here.
# Pancytopenia: Most likely from recent chemo on [**2155-10-29**].
He was given a dose of Vitamin K and his INR improved slightly to 1.3 and remained stable throughout hospitalization without evidence of active bleeding.
# Humerus fx: Felt to be a non-pathologic fracture in the setting of fall.
Pt arrived with Lidoderm patch and MS contin and morphine IR for breakthrough.
# Hyponatremia: Patient's sodium dropped from 137 to 126 during admission.
Thought to be SIADH (from malignancy vs. pain with humerus fracture vs. recent tracheostomy) given that he was euvolemic on exam with good urine output, low serum osms, high urine osms, high urine sodium and improvement with free water restriction.
# DVT prophylaxis: Restarted heparin SC BID in house given high risk for clot given hypercoagulable state with malignancy, discharged on dalteparin.
Inactive issues: # Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine  # Hypertension: Hypertensive on admission.
