loss, loss of appetite and dull aching abdominal pain for a month, associated with chills, sweats.
The pain is constant, alleviated by eating.
Does not burn or radiate.
He also has had a cough for 9 days.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: back pain, gunshot wound in the left clavicle, hepatitis B, headaches, weight loss, cataracts, advanced glaucoma, GERD Mult.
Ophthalmologic/Eyes: : PERLLA, EOMI, no conjuctival injection, anicteric .
Otolaryngologic (ENT): no sinus tenderness, moist mucous membranes, oropharynx without exudate or lesions, no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules .
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.
No hepatomegaly.
Musculoskeletal: no cyanosis, clubbing or edema .
Integumentary: skin warm, no rashes, no jaundice .
Heme/Lymph: no cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy; no axillary or groin adenopathy.
No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
Stable small bilateral pleural effusions.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis of the adjacent lung parenchyma.
The pleural effusions are increased from [**2108-1-5**] and new from [**2107-12-29**].
Rounded hypodense lesion within the atelectatic left lung base, which may represent a pulmonary nodule.
Recommend follow-up CT after resolution of the pleural effusion for better assessment.
Patchy opacities in the posterior upper lobes bilaterally.
This may be secondary to dependent atelectasis or an aspiration event.
Enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node and bulky confluent nodal masses in the abdomen; the latter have increased in size compared to [**2107-12-29**].
retroperitoneal lymph node: Monomorphous population of large atypical lymphoid cells, necrosis and blood.
Numerous apoptotic bodies and mitotic figures are present.
This increased proliferation is admixed with histiocytes that imbibe apoptotic cells (tingible-body macrophages), imparting a "starry-[**Hospital Ward Name **]" appearance.
They are negative for TdT and bcl-1.
CD3 highlights scattered T-lymphocytes.
CD138 stains scattered plasma cells.
The differential diagnosis based on H&E morphology includes a high grade diffuse B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt or atypical Burkitt lymphoma, blastoid mantle cell lymphoma and lymphoblastic lymphoma.
Negative BCL1 and TdT immunostains do not favor a mantle cell lymphoma or lymphoblastic lymphoma, respectively.
Overall, the features are that of a high grade diffuse B-cell lymphoma.
pleural fluid: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS consistent with lymphoma (see note).
The smear shows large cells with round nuclei, course chromatin and scant cytoplasm and admixed small lymphcytes.
MRI head w/o contrast Limited exam without evidence of lymphoma or acute intracranial process.
Hypercellular erythroid dominant bone marrow with erythroid and megakaryocytic dysplasia 2.
Definitive diagnostic/morphologic evidence of lymphoma is not seen.
No pulmonary embolus.
Rounded opacity in the left lower lung is concerning for pneumonia.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
The left pleural effusion has slightly decreased since [**2108-1-11**].
CXR [**1-25**] Since the previous examination, there is significant improved aeration of both lungs with almost complete resolution of the bibasilar dependent atelectasis and the pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Abdominal mass: He initially presented with LUQ abdominal pain and associated weight loss, fevers, night sweats, dyspnea, nodular gastric/duodenal folds, splenic [**Doctor First Name **], pararenal [**Doctor First Name **], para-[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 28407**] [**Doctor First Name **], normocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and hypoalbuminemia.
His mass was radiographically concerning for lymphoma v. primary intestinal (gastric) adenocarcinoma.
The constellation with weight loss was particularly concerning.
He had a laparoscopic lymph node biopsy of an abdominal node as well as a retroperitoneal node (full results in results section) that showed high grade B cell lymphoma.
A bone marrow biopsy showed histiocytosis but no lymphoma.
He also had bilateral pleural effusions, and underwent a thoracocentesis which showed malignant effusion.
He started [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy and tumor lysis labs were followed closely as there was initial concern for Burkitts which would create a high liklihood of tumor lysis.
On [**1-25**] he was no longer neutropenic.
2) Pulmonary On admission he had a cough and an infiltrate on CXR.
After beginning to receive [**Hospital1 **] and aggressive hydration he had an acute oxygen desaturation and temporary hypotension and was transferred to the MICU.
He was transferred to the MICU initially on [**1-13**] for episode of hypoxia with O2 saturation of 88-90% on 2LNC.
He had a CTA which was negative for pulmonary embolus.
He bounced back to the ICU on [**1-15**] for a transient episode of hypoxia thought likely due to combination of bilateral malignant pleural effusions and possible new LLL pneumonia.
He remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
In addition, he was gently diureses with lasix 10 IV as his volume status was net positive likely due to hydration for tumor lysis syndrome.
He was continued on [**Hospital1 **] per BMT recommendations and prophylaxis for tumor lysis syndrome.
Vancomycin and levofloxacin were stopped on day 3, as suspicion for pneumonia low.
His oxygen saturation remained  in the high nineties while on the BMT service and gradually he returned to room air and was satting in the high nineties.
A chest X ray done [**1-25**] showed almost complete resolution of his effusions, no infiltrate and some emphysema.
)ID After completing [**Hospital1 **], infectious disease was called to evaluate him for prophylaxis while neutropenic as he is from rural [**Country 3992**].
As he had fever, nightsweats and an infiltrate on admission it was felt that he needed to be ruled out for tuberculosis.
He has a history of Hep B infection and was placed on lamivudine to prevent recrudescence.

Disp:*30 bottles* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: high grade B cell lymphoma malignant pleural effusions-bilateral history of hepatitis B infection Glaucoma OD Hospitalized for his back injury.
PTSD   Discharge Condition: stable, afebrile, good po intake, ANC 7230, ambulatory   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with abdominal pain.
On your chest X ray there was evidence of pneumonia that was treated.
You had an abdominal CT that showed soft tissue, and you had a biopsy of some of your lymph nodes that showed B cell lymphoma (cancer).
You also had collections of fluid in your lungs that was due to the lymphoma in your abdomen.
You had some of the fluid removed.
You received chemotherapy ([**Hospital1 **]) but had low oxygen from fluid accumulation in your lungs.
You were evaluated for tuberculosis infection for three days and were found not to have tuberculosis.
Your white blood cell count dropped because of the chemotherapy and you were receiving a medication that helps the white blood cells recover.
