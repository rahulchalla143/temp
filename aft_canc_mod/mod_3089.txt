CTA showed moderate b/l pleural effusions, multiple pulm nodules, no PE.
EKG with no ischemic changes.
ICU course c/b acute renal failure, elevated troponin,congestive heart failure and increased temp to 100.9 while receiving 4th unit of PRBCs.
Upon transfer to the floor, patient denies feeling short of breath.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: ONC HX: 65-year-old with renal cell carcinoma diagnosed in [**2085**], status post right nephrectomy.
He did well until [**2100**] when he noticed some tingling in his left elbow.
In [**2100-2-6**], he sustained a left humerus pathologic fracture.
Biopsy at the time of broad-plate fixation showed metastatic clear cell carcinoma.
CT at the time showed two discrete cortical masses in the left kidney upper pole mass being 3 cm in diameter, lower pole mass being 3.5 cm x 5 cm, and a sixth rib lesion.
There had been some suggestion in [**2100-10-6**] of an increase in size of the left upper pole tumor.
In [**2101-9-7**], he had minimal asymptomatic progression of the mass above the left renal vein and the expansive lesions within the sixth rib associated with a new soft tissue mass were noted.
Most recently, he has had difficulty with metastatic tumor nodules in his left arm.
His Avastin was stopped secondary to concerns of poor wound healing.
PMH: # metastatic renal cell cancer # hypertension secondary to Avastin and Sutent # cerebral aneurysm, resulting in lack of smell and taste # recent admit for cellulitis possibly c/b osteomyelitis  Social History: 50-pack-year smoking history.
Parents died of heart disease.

[**2104-1-7**] CXR Increased interstitial markings and pulmonary vascular prominence are suggestive of a new mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
Persistent lytic sclerotic lesion in the right sixth rib posteriorly.
[**2104-1-7**] CTA .
Extremely limited study from poor contrast opacification.
No evidence of central pulmonary embolism.
Innumerable pulmonary nodules concerning for metastases.
Destructive bony lesions as described above.
Left upper pole renal cell carcinoma.
Left adrenal nodule could be a metastasis.
Some small liver lesions are not definitely cysts and could be metastases.
Bilateral moderately large pleural effusions, right slightly greater than left.
Small pericardial effusion.

The pt had a brief admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], with elevated LFT's and ARF followed by rash, fevers, and worsening acute renal failure.
The pt's course was then c/b thrombocytopenia and cholestasis and low fibrinogen, fevers, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, increasing coags, worsening renal failure, and increasing bilirubin.
He was later found to have a Pseudomonas UTI on [**1-29**] along with a new rash and sore throat.
Sore throat Pt had evidence of well-demarcated lesions in posterior oropharynx, seen first on [**2-2**].
Anemia Thought to be hemolytic anemia vs. bone-marrow suppression.
No evidence of bleeding (stools, other than the ones on admission, have been guaiac negative).
Presented with hemolytic anemia (likely hapten-mediated given beta-lactam exposure), but no evidence of hemolysis (normal haptoglobin, normalizing LDH and bilirubins) in recent days.
UTI Urine culture positive on [**1-29**] for Pseudomonas (pan-sensitive).
Fevers initially thought to be secondary to drug effect (Unasyn); antibiotics (Unasyn/Vanco) were discontinued on [**1-20**].
Acute renal failure On admission, creatinine was 1.0, but he developed acute renal failure after CTA (~1.5).
Renal consulted [**1-20**], concerned for AIN from Unasyn vs. ATN from vanco vs. pigment induced renal failure.
Thrombocytopenia Pt's PLTs started trending downward on [**1-18**].
Bone marrow suppression (from Sutent vs. urosepsis) was most likely cause; initially may have been secondary to an autoimmune process, as platelets improved on steroids (but steroids need to be weaned given infection and recent neutropenia).
Microangiopathic process less likely (no schistocytes on smear, normal fibrinogen and FDP's).
Neutropenia ANC is now >1000.
Lower extremity edema Lower extremities are wrapped in ACE bandages.
Abdominal distention On physical exam, he had abdominal distention without tympany, and multiple abdominal x-rays had shown no evidence of obstruction or perforation.
He had minimal bowel sounds, but continued to have bowel movements.
Abdominal X-Ray on [**1-29**] showed no evidence of free air or obstruction.
Dyspnea/pulmonary edema Pt was dyspneic with minimal activity.
Most likely related to pulmonary hypertension (etiology: lymphangitic carcinomatisis vs. COPD vs. both, pulmonary consulted [**2104-1-12**]).
Renal Cell Carcinoma Considering Avastin as outpatient.
Hypertension Hypertensive on admission; once Sutent was discontinued, he became normotensive.
Renal ultrasound showed no evidence of renal artery stenosis.
Went back on Sutent with BP's as high as 210 systolic; developed hypotension (90's systolic) on [**1-29**], when urine culture grew Pseudomonas.
Pulmonary hypertension Diagnosed on echo.
Calcified tendonitis, seen by ortho given concern for fracture (but they determined it was tendonitis).
Oxycodone for pain management, outpatient follow up.
Elevated cardiac enzymes.
Enzymes elevated on admission, cards consulted, decided that it was in the setting of demand ischemia (given increased BP) and no heparin required.
No further issues.
Hypothyroidism Continued levothyroxine.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for throat pain.

Secondary: Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma   Discharge Condition: The patient was discharged hemodynamically stable and afebrile with appropriate follow up.
