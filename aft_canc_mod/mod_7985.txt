Admission Date:  [**2117-5-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-5-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2052-2-29**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: brain mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2117-4-26**]: Right Craniotomy and Mass Resection   History of Present Illness: This is a 65 year old female with no past medical history who noticed she had difficulty typing at her job early this week.
She felt as if her hands were clumsy and she could not find the right keys.
She went to the outside hospital where workup included a CT head and this was consistent with right frontal mass and surronding vasogenic edema.
An MRI confirmed an enhancing mass and per reports her CT Torso was free of metastatic disease.
She says her family thinks she has some slurred speech but she does not think so.
No dysarthria.
No tongue weakness.
On motor examination, there is no weakness.
On general examination, the oropharynx is clear, the lungs are clear, the heart is regular, the legs are without edema or tenderness.
Right frontal surgical site is benign, no redness swelling or discharge.
Right upper and lower extremity antigravity.
Pertinent Results: WAND [**5-26**] Unchanged heterogeneous mass lesion on the right frontal lobe, consistent with the provided diagnosis of glioblastoma, again prominent vessels are noted within this mass lesion, causing moderate mass effect and associated vasogenic edema.
No new lesions are demonstrated in the interval.
Postoperative appearance to the right frontal lobe with minimal amount of hyperdense material in the postoperative bed.
Bifrontal moderate pneumocephalus with posterior dispalcement of the frontal lobes.
Persistent right sided edema and mass effect on the right lateral ventricle with possible minimal increase of mass effect upon the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].

The extent of midline shift through the left by 8 mm is slightly increased from 6 mm on the previous study.
There is continued effacement of the right lateral ventricle and partial effacement of the left lateral ventricle.
There is residual tumor along the surgical margins.
There is vasogenic edema surrounding the surgical cavity.
Diffusion images demonstrate slow diffusion along the resection margins suggestive of ischemia.
IMPRESSION: Status post right frontoparietal craniotomy with post-surgical changes and partial resection of the right frontal tumor.
Residual tumor is seen at the medial and posterior aspect of resection margin with increased gyral swelling, which may reflect a combination of ischemia.
The degree of midline shift to the left is minimally increased, likely related to post-surgical changes.
She underwent a craniotomy and resection without complication.
Post operative head CT revealed minimal amount of hyperdense material and bilateral pneumocephalus consistent with  post-operative change.
She underwent an MRI scan of the brain on [**5-27**] which showed status post right frontoparietal craniotomy with post-surgical changes and partial resection of the right frontal tumor.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Brain Lesion   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
