He represented to OSH last evening after episode of witnessed [**Month/Day (1) 862**] (left cheek/mouth tremors, both eyes tremors, L sided weakness and expressive aphagia) where CT head showed SAH, SHD.
Intubated with propofol for decreased MS (initially had been A&O x 3, not hypoxic, but meds caused sedation) which was difficult d/t laryngeal CA and large right sided laryngeal mass was noted.
Was noted to have left cheek and eye tremor x 5 min and started on ativan gtt for approx.
Given lopressor 5mg IV x 1 for elevated CE, EKG with 'ST elevations' in ant leads.
He denies chest pain, jaw pain, pain in arm, pain in belly.
Per family, patient has not had any complaints except for HA, right eye pain, and photophobia since fall, all unchanged in severity.
Past Medical History: HTN migraine SCCA/laryngeal cancer dx [**2118-1-17**] - T2, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] sensory seizures followed by neurology recent SAH/SDH as above some Parkinsonian features noted by neurology (cogwheel rigidity) s/p CCY   Social History: lives alone but at [**Location (un) 931**] House since last admission, no tob/ETOH/illicit drug use, 5 sons  Family History: unknown  Physical Exam: Vitals: 101.3 (Tm 103), 135/66 (SBP 127-161), 89 (68-89), 15, 100% on CPAP/PS 8/5, FiO2 0.4, TV 600's, RR 8-12 with MV of 5L --> ABG 7.46/35/186 Gen: Intubated, responds appropriately to questions HEENT: Pupils oval in appearance, 3-->2 bilaterally, EOM grossly intact, large 2-3 cm mass in anterior right neck Cardiac: RRR, NL S1 and S2, no MRGs Lungs: upper airway sounds, no decreased BS, crackles Abd: soft, NTND, NABS, no HSM Ext: 2+ DP pulses, no edema, cool Neuro: responsive to questions, 5/5 strength UE, able to lift legs off bed bilaterally, toes downgoing   Pertinent Results: Admission labs: 137  97  12 -----------<85 2.8  27  0.6 .
Imaging: Head CT ([**2118-2-12**]): The subdural collection in the right temporal lobe measures 9.3 cm and is not significantly changed compared to the prior study.
Subdural blood is also seen layering over the right parietal and occipital convexities into hemorrhage.
Arachnoid blood is seen in the bilateral temporal, parietal, and right frontal lobes.
There is no shift of the normally midline structures or uncal herniation.
IMPRESSION: Decreased extent of diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage.
The subdural hemorrhage has not significantly changed in size.
Repeat Head CT [**2118-2-13**]: not yet read, no obvious change.
CXR [**2118-2-12**]: No acute CP process.
Foci of air posterior to clavicle of uncertain significance possibly secondary to attempted line placement.
Foci of air anterior to endotracheal tube may be secondary to traumatic intubation.
EKG [**2118-2-12**]: NSR at 65, nml axis, nml intervals, Q wave in V1 and V2, ST elevation V1-V3 with 0.5 st depression in V5, poor R wave progression.
Repeat ECG [**2118-2-13**]: new deep TWI V2-V4 with ST elevation >1.0-1.5 with Q waves (not new).
Mild LVH.
No masses or thrombi.
LVSF mod depressed with regionality c/w CAD (EF 25-30%).
Mild global RV free wall HK.
KUB [**2118-2-15**]: There are multiple dilated small bowel loops throughout the abdomen.
Maximum small bowel diameter measures 4.6 cm.
No definite air-fluid levels are seen.
No free air is seen under the diaphragms.
There is a small amount of air within the rectum.
There is a lumbar levoscoliosis without associated degenerative changes centered around L3-L5.
IMPRESSION: Multiple dilated small bowel loops throughout the abdomen with decompressed colon, consistent with small bowel obstruction.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 80 year old man s/p recent fall c/b SDH and SAH who representsed with [**Month/Day/Year 862**], elevated cardiac enzymes, and fevers who was intubated for airway protection, now extubated with small bowel obstruction.
Small bowel obstruction: Unclear etiology, developed in the early morning [**2-15**], KUB showed likely SBO, NGT placed/surgery consulted, large volume gastric fluid out of NGT with some relief of nausea.
Will discuss with cards perioperative management given recent acute MI (will increase metoprolol).
There was no obvious cause of bowel obstruction.
H/o seizures in the past, no change in SAH/SDH imaging, ?
Switched to IV phenytoin q8, now theraputic with no obvious further seizures.
In error on transfer ([**2-13**]) given 500mg IV x1 (stopped prior to completion but he recieved most of the infussion), level in am 19.9, no toxicity noted on exam, hold next 2 doses and start PO pm [**2-14**].
On admission thought possible UTI on UA from [**2-11**] but cx negative, blood and urine cultures from OSH pending.
Patient did not have altered mental status on admission.
Did have HA and photophobia, but both of these have been present since admission on [**2-7**] and pt did not have fever at that time.
No leukocytosis.
Possible retrocardiac opacity on CXR but could be sterile aspiration with [**Month/Day (4) 862**] leading to pneumonitis with fever but no infection.
STEMI: Difficult to differentiate between STEMI and LVH with ST changes, but has developed Q waves in past couple of days and more likely STEMI, also now with TWI in V. ECHO with regional WMA suggestive of CAD and no prior to compare to.
Unable to perform emergent cath in this patient with recent SDH/SAH, and unable to do heparin/integrillin.
ECG from [**2118-2-13**] reviewed with cardiology fellow, thought to represent dynamic changes in the setting of STEMI at some point between [**2-7**] and [**2-11**], CE's trending down previously, repeat [**2118-2-13**] at 2100: CK: 70 MB: not done trop 0.09.
Repeat CE's [**2-14**]: CK 60 MB not done trop 0.10, on tele an atrial arrhythmia but no other abnormalities, aspirin through [**2-15**], held [**2-16**] as NPO/surgery, BB (IV, titrated up 1/10), statin (held while NPO).
No further pain medication needed.
H/O laryngeal cancer: Patient with known right laryngeal mass, but never obstructive on when evaluated on [**1-26**].
Currently 33, likely d/t recent bleed.
Likely etiology poor PO intake in setting of recent bleed as well as fluroquinolones.
Urinary retention: Noted after foley d/c [**2-13**], possibly exacerbated to paraphimosis but he was able to void from 430cc->260cc (PVR 110) on [**2118-2-14**] so foley not replaced, start tamsulosin 0.4mg po qhs [**2-14**] but foley replaced [**2-15**] when SBO developed.
