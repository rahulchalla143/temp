She was also reported to be complaining of worsening weakness, dizziness and decreased po intake.
The patient was recently seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] a cystoscopy was done on [**2184-1-16**] which showed an anterolateral and posterior wall tumor.
Urine cytology was suspicious for urotherlial dysplasia.
A CT was also done as part of that work up which revealed two bladder masses concerning for TCC.
The patient was admitted for w/u for her ARF and hematuria.
On the floor, the patient c/o constipation.

Multiple round soft tissue nodules are seen in both lungs, the largest at the junction of the left lower lobe and lingula measuring 2.3 x 2.0 cm.
There is moderate-sized simple right pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis of a major portion of the right lower lobe.
There is no left pleural effusion.
Few enlarged lymph nodes are seen in the paratracheal, prevascular, subcarinal and hilar regions, with the largest lymph node in the prevascular region measuring 13 mm (2:17).
The imaged portion of the heart is unremarkable, except for extensive coronary arterial calcification.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No significant mediastinal, hilar, or axillary adenopathy is seen.
The main and lobar pulmonary arteries are dilated, with the main pulmonary artery measuring 3.2 cm, consistent with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
The thoracic aorta has moderate atherosclerotic calcification without aneurysmal dilation.
BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: No bone lesions suspicious for infection or malignancy are detected.
Mild degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
In this patient with clinical concern for bladder cancer, multiple pulmonary nodules are concerning for metastatic disease.
Few mostly calcified mediastinal lymph nodes relate to prior granulomatous disease.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Moderate-sized simple right pleural effusion.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2184-3-11**] at 11:32:35 AM      FINAL  GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen (may be underestimated due to the technically suboptimal nature of this study).
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: severe, chronic or acute-on-chronic right ventricular afterload excess  CHEST PORT.
These could reflect mucus plugging or acute lung disease such as aspiration or blleding.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2184-3-11**] 1:16 PM IMPRESSION: No evidence of right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.
There is substantial interval increase in the right pleural effusion, questionable intervention should be of concern.
There is evidence of interval development of minimal pulmonary edema.
No pneumothorax is seen.
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT Study Date of [**2184-3-12**] 10:13 AM IMPRESSION: No evidence of left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.
Continued mild to large layering pleural effusion on the right with compressive atelectasis.
Similar opacification at the left base consistent with atelectasis and small pleural effusion.
Known bilateral pulmonary nodules are seen in better detail on the recent CT scan.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 89 yo F with a PMHx of recently diagnosed bladder masses suspicious for TCC, dementia, DM II who p/w ARF, persistent hematuria and fatigue and decreased po intake.
Pt was initially admitted to the medical service for evaluation and treatment of her anemia which was presumably due to microscopic/macroscopic hematuria.
She was seen by urology for evaluation for suspected bladder cancer.
These were presumed metastatic disease.
On the morning of [**2184-3-10**] the patient was noted to be unresponsive after being turned upon having a bowel movement.
She had no pulse during this arrest and a Code blue was called for PEA arrest with return of pulse after 2 cycles chest compressions and 1mg epi x2 and 1amp bicarb.
CXR in the unit showed white out of the entire right lung suggesting layering of her known pleural effusion (likely malignancy related, see below).
CXR also suggested some new widening of the mediastinum.
She did not exhibit much neurologic function; would respond to painful stimuli but no other responses.
TTE showed pulmonary hypertension and evidence of RV strain.
Neurology was consulted and found her to have positive brainstem reflexes but little evidence of cortical function.
