Admission Date:  [**2116-1-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2116-1-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2053-10-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: All drug allergies previously recorded have been deleted  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**] Chief Complaint: Recurring pleural effusions  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracentesis VATS   History of Present Illness: This is a 62 year old female with past medical history of anxiety/depression, who is being transferred from [**Hospital3 417**] for recurrent pleural effusions.
She was admitted [**12-30**] to the OSH with SOB, pleuritic chest pain, and throat/tongue discomfort.
She returned to the ER the subsequent day [**12-30**] w/ pleuritic chest pain, subjective fever, dysphagia and throat pain.
Her pain was hard to control and required toradol and morphine.
She was found to have bl pleural effusion, and thoracic sx performed thoracentesis of the effusions.
[**Female First Name (un) **] revealed exudative effusion, w/ negative gram stain, afb neg, neg cytology.
A CT of the neck was done for her neck swelling (per patient) and incidentally showed 2x1cm mass at base of tongue.
Her hospital course was further complicated by persistent leukocytosis, low grade fevers, tachycardia, with occasional episodes of [**1-11**] run of VT. From OSH records it is unclear when abx regimen was switched but patient was started on levo/ceftriaxone.
CT of chest was repeated given persistent tachy which was negative for PE but sig for recurrent bl pleural effusions and in light of tongue mass the primary team was concerned for possible malignancy.
Plan was to possible retap or thoracoscopic drainage and pleurodesis by thoracic surgery, but patient requested to be transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Currently patient states that her chest pain has improved and is throughout on right/left, worse on inspiration.
She also describes back pain that is worse on inspiration.
Her throat swelling has subsided.
She states that her dysphagia and throat pain has also improved.
She continues to feel short of breath at times, and uses supplemental oxygen for relief.
She denies any weight loss or fevers/chills throughout the few months prior to this admission.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
There is borderline right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
PATHOLOGY (Pleural biopsy)  I)  Pleural debris (A-B):  Fibrin with organization and acute inflammation.
II)  Pleura, biopsy (C-D):  Pleura with granulation tissue and organizing fibrin.
No mass noted at the base of the tongue.
No lymphadenopathy within the head or neck.
Motion degraded images but no gross abnormality of the visualized lungs or arterial vessels noted.
Brief Hospital Course: 62 year old female with past medical history of anxiety/depression, transferred from [**Hospital3 417**] for recurrent bilateral pleural effusions, question of b/l pna, radiographic evidence of possible tongue mass for further management.
Pleural fluid was consistent with exudative process, and in the setting of polys/low pH/low glucose there was a concern for complicated parapneumonic effusion.
Pathology report revealed fibrin with organization and acute inflammation, but was non-diagnostic.
Percocet PRN and Lidocaine patch were prescribed for pain control.
Per patient this was associated with neck swelling which has since improved.
From radiology imaging report there was note of mild narrowing of the supraglottic airway with scattered small nodes, without any comment on vasculature.
There was concern for possible malignancy, squamous cell vs lymphoma.
She was not started on anticoagulation given low CHADS score.
The a fib was thought to be secondary to infection.
CE were negative, thyroid function normal, and echo showed borderline right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
The patient was evaluated by cardiology service, who concluded that pericardiocentesis is not indicated.
The patient had another episode of afib with RVR prior to discharge, but remained hemodynamically stable, and converted back to sinus with IV Lopressor.
Thrombocytosis: The patient was seen by Hematology consult, who evaluated a peripheral smear and felt that thrombocytosis is likely reactive.
Iron panel was performed which revealed Ferritin of 474, findings c/w anemia of chronic disease and no evidence of iron, vit b12 or folate deficiency.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.

You were also noted to have some fluid around your heart on heart imaging (Echocardiogram).
Over the past several days, your breathing and pain have improved.
