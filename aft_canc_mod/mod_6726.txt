She underwent upper endoscopy, found large ulcer in Anterior duodenal bulb, that did not bleed on Upper endoscopy, but pt continued to bleed post procedure.
After the procedure overnight patient continued to have melena, and had a large hematoma on the scalp.Hematomal bleeding was well controlled and patient did not rebleed from that site, which was likely a result of her fall while on the toilet with the massive bleed via GI tract.
After discussion with the family it was felt that patient would be better served with no more transfusions and no angio intervention to control the bleeding if it recurs.
