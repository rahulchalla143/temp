[**2131-12-16**]   Radiology WRIST(3 + VIEWS) LEFT FINDINGS: Fiberglass splint obscures the bony detail.
No definite acute fracture.
No dislocation.
Unchanged mild radiocarpal joint space narrowing and sclerosis.
Unchanged mild degenerative changes at the capitate-lunate and capitate-scaphoid articulations with some sclerosis.
Unchanged degenerative changes of the DRUJ with joint space narrowing and osseous spurring.
No change in alignment.
[**2131-12-15**] EGD: - 2 cords of grade II varices were seen in the lower third of the esophagus.
There were stigmata of recent bleeding - 2 bands were successfully placed in the lower third of the esophagus.
GIB: Patient with h/o EtOH cirrhosis and HCC s/p TACE, known esophageal varices s/p banding in [**6-15**], and [**11-20**], gastritis, and duodenal ulcer.
Presenting with heme positive brown stool and 2 episodes of dark bloody hematemesis, so likely source is upper.
Pt was also started on sucralfate [**Hospital1 **] given his recent banding procedure.
Pt's nadolol was initially held given acute bleed but then restarted after Pt was monitored and stable, taking POs.
Pt was supplemented w/ MVI/thiamine/folate daily and had a social work consult.
Pt was started on lactulose tid titrated to [**4-13**] loose BM daily because he had some mild confusion and significant distortion of his sleep/wake schedule.
Pt states that his thinking and nocturnal sleeping both improved significantly on lactulose, and this medication was continued on discharge.
?wrist fx: Patient seen in ED [**11-29**] and [**12-2**] for wrist pain after bike accident.
No fractures seen on XR, but splint was placed for possible scaphoid fracture.
Only mild pain at this time.
His lisinopril/hctz may need to be restarted at a lower dose if his BP increases.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: variceal bleed  Secondary: EtOH cirrhosis - portal HTN, esophageal varices HCC GERD with erosive gastritis HTN  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had an emergent upper endoscopy, which showed that you had bleeding from varices (dilated blood vessels) at the bottom of your esophagus.
You did not have any evidence of any further bleeding.
We believe that most of your symptoms are related to your continued drinking.
