CT head non-contrast ([**2179-12-10**]): There is no evidence of infarction, edema, hemorrhage, mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
Again noted is a known pituitary lesion within the left lateral aspect of the sella which appears isodense to the brain.
There appears to be extension of this lesion into the left cavernous sinus.
It measures 1.3 (CC) x 1.7 (AP) x 1.7 cm (TRV) which, allowing for technical differences, is overall unchanged.
Again noted is expansion of the sella floor with inferior extension into the sphenoid sinus.
As previously described, the lesion demonstrates significant encasement of the cavernous carotid artery without obstruction of flow.
There has been rightward displacement of the infundibular stalk, with no involvement upon the optic pathway.
There are no findings to suggest acute hemorrhage.
There is no evidence for intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, edema, additional mass or shift of the normally midline structures.
No other abnormal foci of enhancement or FLAIR-signal are seen.
Again incidentally noted is a small developmental venous anomaly within the left basal ganglia.
Brief Hospital Course: ## Headache: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted for pain control for her severe frontal headache.
She had a non-contrast head CT and MRI w/w/o contrast during this admission that failed to show growth of the meningioma, hemorrhage, infarction, cerebral edema, or sinusitis.
She had mild neck stiffness but no fever, so lumbar puncture was not done.
Her pain was initially treated with Dilaudid and Toradol.
By the next day, she was doing well on Toradol monotherapy for her pain and was off narcotics.
## Acute kidney injury: Cr elevated to 1.2 on admission, which was above her baseline and likely due to volume depletion from vomiting in setting of her headaches.
## Transaminitis: She was incidentally found to have transaminitis during this admission.
- Hepatitis serologies need to be followed up.
9. trazodone 100 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
10. ibuprofen 600 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO three times a day as needed for headache.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Headache Acute renal failure Transaminitis Pituitary adenoma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for treatment of severe headache, which was thought to be a side effect of your CyberKnife treatment.
CAT scan and MRI did not show any change in the size of your adenoma or any swelling or inflammation of your brain tissues.
