History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known lastname 4610**] is a 67yo woman with a history notable for renal cell carcinoma diagnosed [**2107**] s/p left nephrectomy.
She has known mets to brain, bone, lungs, adrenal gland and abdominal cavity.
On [**1-28**], she felt her arm give way while pushing open a door, and was taken to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital, where she was diagnosed with a left humerus fracture.
A skeletal survey showed a right distal humeral metastatic lesion as well.
However approximately 3 days post-op, she developed abdominal distension, decreased bs, and then began vomiting bilious liquid.
A CT head to look for increased ICP was done and was negative and additionally the known cerebellar lesion seen on MRI was not seen.
She developed decreased UOP and was transferred on [**2-9**] to the SICU for closer fluid management.
Patient had CT torso while in the unit which showed adynamic ileus, no large/small bowel obstruction, new pulmonary, mesenteric, right adrenal metastases.
She has begun to have liquid stools and flatus.
She has had continued decreased urine output that has not responded to .5-1 L boluses but has responded to IV lasix.
She has been markedly hypokalemic and has required aggressive repletion.
The patient currently reports no chest pain, no sob, slight abdominal tenderness in mid epigastrium.
NO fevers or chills or sweats.
Past Medical History: Renal cell carcinoma -dx [**2107**] s/p left nephrectomy -recurrence [**1-30**] with noted ulmonary mets and adrenal mass -s/p IL2 x 2 cycles -MRI with cerebellar met [**8-2**], s/p SRS but lesion still present -s/p path fx left humerus on this admit and ORIF Hypertension S/p appendectomy S/p lap chole S/p hysterectomy S/p D+C  Social History: The patient is single.

Adjacent atelectatic changes and a tiny right-sided pleural effusion are also present.
Otherwise, the appearance of multiple pulmonary nodules noted at the left base is similar.
The large cystic lesion in the liver has an unchanged appearance.
Surgical clips are seen in the gallbladder fossa consistent with prior cholecystectomy.
There is a new right adrenal mass measuring 10 x 25 mm.
There are new mesenteric masses in the upper abdomen.
There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy or free air.
A small amount of perihepatic ascites is noted, however.
Edema seen extensively in the subcutaneous soft tissues.
There is fecal material and gas in the colon.
There are areas of mild small bowel dilatation, and segments of mild colonic dilatation as well, most notably in the transverse colon.
However, no transition point is seen, and the overall pattern is consistent with adynamic ileus.
There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy or free fluid.
Subcutaneous edema is noted.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
IMPRESSION:  1) Likely adynamic ileus with no evidence of small or large bowel obstruction.
2) More extensive metastatic disease as described.
[**2-8**] ct head  FINDINGS: There is no intra or extra-axial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, or change in the size of the ventricles.
There is no new evidence of a major vascular territorial infarct.
There is a stable area of low attenuation in the left basal ganglia, which could represent a lacunar infarct.
The known left cerebellar hemisphere and cerebellar vermis masses are not appreciated on this study.
There is no new mass effect.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or new mass effect.
Brief Hospital Course: ##Ortho: pt underwent ORIF without complications as described in the HPI.
She also has tumor in right humerus and should be moved carefully given high risk of pathologic fracture of right humerus.
## GI: As described above, she had a KUB that showed adynamic ileus.
She continued to have some nausea and preferred not to take solid po's for this reason.
She had no vomiting.
Her abdominal exam remained with some slight tenderness in the LUQ and periumbilical region, but there was no rebound or guarding.
She complained mostly of gas and bloating with diarrhea which continues to improve slowly day by day.
## Respiratory: The pt continued to complain of SOB and DOE.
She was diuresed with lasix 20mg IV tid and showed significant improvement.
She also had audible wheezes on exam although she states she has no h/o asthma or COPD.
However, the pt would not tolerate an MRI [**12-31**] discomfort with lying flat (felt SOB) and pain with having to pull her arms in tightly.
## ID: Pt had a urine cx with enterococcus and GPC.
However, there was no significant pyuria so the pt was not treated with antibiotics.
No evidence of bacteremia - blood cultures were negative.
She remained afebrile and foley was changed and pt remained asymptomatic.
##Hypokalemia: the pt developed diarrhea and required aggressive potassium regimen to keep her K level up.
Efforts were made to restrict the amt of fluid given and the solution was cut down to 1500ml.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: L humerus fracture   Discharge Condition: Good.
