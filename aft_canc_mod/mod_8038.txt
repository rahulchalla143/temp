Admission Date:  [**2131-8-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-9-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2086-6-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: Neutropenic fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation Central venous cannulation  History of Present Illness: 45yo female with PMH significant for metastatic breast ca (dx in [**6-/2124**], mets to bones, liver, lungs) and GERD, s/p recent chemo (Gemcitabine) with severe mucositis p/w neutropenic fever up to 103.5.
However, her breast cancer continued to metastasize.
She was recently ([**Date range (1) 66670**]) admitted for N/V/fever, found to have CBD compression secondary to liver mets.
However, she was found to have severe mucositis with an ANC of 740 (WBC 1.1) and it was decided to hold off further chemo for now and reassess next week.
She also reported intermittent, mild nosebleeds and vaginal bleeds.
After this clinic visit, she found her temperature to be elevated to 101, then rising to 103 the next when she decided to go to the ED.
ROS: chronic productive cough (greenish sputum) since last admission; no SOB, CP, HA, urinary sx,, dizziness; nausea, vomiting x1 yesterday (greenish); loss of appetite; difficulty eating due to mucositis (last PO intake 3days ago); chronic diarrhea (increased recently); transient bleeding from vagina, nose, mouth; bloody stools occasionally.
Oncologic History: - Diagnosed with R breast ca in 5/[**2124**].
She had a 7 x 6 x 2.5 cm infiltrating ductal carcinoma with LVI that was excised at the time but had positive margins as well as DCIS.
- The patient had metastatic disease to the ribs, vertebrae, liver, and lungs from the start.
- In [**5-11**] she noticed a large lump in her R breast and her tumor markers had increased so treatment was again changed to Aromasin.
She transferred her care to us in [**2130-8-5**] at which time she was noted to have further progression of her disease.
She received a total of 5 cycles of single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] Taxol and then on [**2131-1-9**] was started on weekly Taxol and D1,D15 Avastin IV as her umor markers were increasing - [**8-10**], she was also started on Zometa, which has not been repeated since then due to severe side effects.
- Admitted on [**7-4**] for CBD compression due to liver mets, s/p biliary stent and therapeutic paracentesis; received also adriamycin during this admission - [**8-11**], she was started on gemcitabine, was on d#8 of first cycle on [**8-27**] when severe mucositis was noted.
vitals T 103.2 BP 99/82 HR 126 RR 32 O2 sat 90% 4L Gen: Pleasant female lying in bed covered up, NAD HEENT: multiple large shallow oral ulcers, severe icterus of both sclerae Neck: No cervical LAD, supple Heart: nl s1/s2, no s3/s4, no m,r,g Lungs: CTAB, no crackles Abdomen: soft, mild distension, no tenderness, no hepatosplenomegaly Extremities: 3+ LE edema, 2+ DP pulses bilaterally Skin: no open skin between toes or perirectally, no rash .
# Respiratory distress: She was orally intubated due to increased O2 requirements as well as increased work of breathing on [**8-30**].
Her clinical picture was consistent with ARDS, with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and no history of CHF.
Difficulty to wean was thought most likely secondary to multiple etiologies including ARDS, pulmonary edema, and total body volume overload resulting in pressure-dependent atelectasis.
She was febrile and neutropenic on admission.
Multiple potential etiologies including lung, skin, oropharynx with severe mucositis, perirectal, lines, UTI & possible GI process were considered.
She was treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl for broad-spectrum coverage, fever quickly resolved, and continued to have negative cultures.
Yet she remained hypotensive and pressor-dependent.
On [**9-4**], she developed a new leukocytosis with bandemia.
Blood cx from [**9-8**] grew gram positive cocci and gram positive rods.
She became significantly total body fluid overloaded secondary to this aggressive fluid resuscitation yet remained significantly intravascularly depleted.
# Hematocrit drop: Pt had a normal baseline hematocrit, but dropped to 26.6 during this admission.
Near the end of her hospitalization she had evidence of UGI bleed  with blood-tinged fluid noted in OGT.
PTT and INR were elevated, likely secondary to liver failure [**3-9**] liver mets and shock liver.
Bleed from OGT likely secondary to stress induced gastritis.
# Coagulopathy: PTT and INR increased near the end of her hospitalization.
Etiology of the coagulopathy was thought to be multifactorial including liver failure and hemodilution [**3-9**] fluid overload.
# Renal failure: She developed acute renal failure during her hospitalization.
It was thought most likely pre-renal, secondary to hypovolemia, and initially her renal fuction improved s/p volume repletion.
Likely secondary to hypotension and pressor use.
# Metastatic breast CA: Mets to multiple sites including lungs, liver & bone, also with breast mass as well as lymphadenopathy.
Liver failure attributed to liver mets & compression of biliary tract.
Was on Gemcitabine to treat her liver mets, however recently stopped for severe mucositis.
