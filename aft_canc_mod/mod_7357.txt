There is no evidence of aortic dissection.
Additionally, within the descending thoracic aorta is an 8 cm saccular aneurysm versus pseudoaneurysm with mural thrombus.
On this contrast-enhanced study it does not appear that there is acute hemorrhage into the wall of the aorta within the descending thoracic aneurysm.
The caliber of the aorta at the arch and inferior to the thoracic aneurysm is normal.
Again, the lung fields show diffuse emphysematous changes bilaterally.
There is minimal atelectasis within the left lower lung lobe.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
There is no pathologically enlarged axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
There is moderate calcified atherosclerotic disease within the visualized thoracic aorta.
There is heavy atherosclerotic calcification within the iliac arteries and their branches, however, contrast is seen within the femoral arteries distal to the bypass bilaterally.
The liver contains a rounded 1 cm low density focus in the posterior aspect of the right lobe of the liver, which likely represents a simple renal cyst.
A calcified focus in the anterior aspect of the right lobe of the liver may represent a hepatoartery pseudo aneurysm versus a granuloma.
Again, the left kidney is not seen, however, the right kidney contains multiple exophytic and intraparenchymal cysts, the largest measuring 10 cm and is located in the upper pole.
The stomach and intra-abdominal loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable.
There is no evidence for bowel dilatation.
There is no pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
There is no free fluid within the abdomen.
There is no free air.
There is an enhancing mass in the anterior aspect of the bladder measuring 2.5 x 3.4 cm.
There is no pathologically enlarged inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
Degenerative changes are seen within the thoracolumbar spine.
Ascending saccular aortic aneurysm measuring 9 cm and demonstrating a contained acute hemorrhagic rupture into the middle mediastinum.
Additional descending thoracic aortic saccular aneurysm versus pseudo- aneurysm without evidence for acute intramural hematoma.
Moderate atherosclerotic calcifications throughout the aorta with infrarenal aortoiliac bypass graft, demonstrating patency to the femoral arteries bilaterally.
Very atrophic left kidney with multiple intraparenchymal and exophytic cysts of the right kidney.
Enhancing small anterior bladder mass which could represent a polyp or mass  CARDIOLOGY: [**2184-4-28**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest consistent with the presence of a small secundum type atrial septal defect.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.
Selective coronary angiography showed a right dominant system with LMCA that had a 50-60% lesion.
The LAD had sequential 70% proximal and 50% lesions with post-stenotic dilatations and was severely calcified.
LCX had a high OM1 with 50% stenosis and a mid-vessel 70% lesion.
Hemodynamic assessment was limited and showed normal aortic systemic  Brief Hospital Course: This is a 79 year old gentleman who presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and was found to have a contained rupture of ascending and descending components of a large saccular thoracic aortic aneurysm.
On hospital day 2 he underwent cardiac catheterization in preparation for surgery and was found to have significant multi-vessel disease.
After discussing the complicated surgery and possible prolonged hospital course, as well as high comorbid state given his coronary disease, the patient opted for no operative intervention and asked to be DNR/DNI with comfort measures only on [**2184-4-30**].
Disp:*120 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2* Diltiazem Protonix Terazosin Flovent Sertraline   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: contained rupture of thoracic ascending and descending Aortic Aneurysm Secondary: Multi-vessel coronary artery disease, hypertension   Discharge Condition: Stable.
You should meet with your primary care physician to discuss continuation of your blood pressure medications.
You should return to the ER with any worsening pain/shortness of breath/light-headedness.
Followup Instructions: Follow-up with your primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 1 week to discuss maintenance of your blood pressure medications.
