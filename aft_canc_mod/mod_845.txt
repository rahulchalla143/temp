She has been having copious diarrhea and vomiting for the last few weeks as well.
The son had not noticed any change in mental status or any other new issues other than continued weakness.
[**Last Name (STitle) 3357**]  Past Medical History: 1) Metastatic renal cell carcinoma - s/p left nephrectomy with concurrent resection of an isolated  pulmonary nodule in 12/[**2160**].
- Adjuvant high-dose interleukin-2 therapy in [**1-/2161**] - CCI/IFN trial terminated in [**11/2162**] because of cumulative side effects and the lack of definitive measurable disease.
- Thalidomide d/c [**8-/2163**] due to side effects and disease progression.
- Avastin off study terminated because of disease progression.
- Photodynamic therapy terminated because of hemoptysis and MI during bronchoscopy.
- Mediastinal radiation therapy.
- Gemcitabine terminated because of disease progression.
- Currently enrolled in open-access sorafenib trial (started [**2164-9-12**] - [**2164-10-29**] Torso CT: unchanged thoracic inlet LAD, large pretracheal LN, subcarinal LN, LLL mass (3.7 X 3.4 cm), multiple hypodense liver masses.
Hyperlipidemia  Social History: SHx: Married.
Family History: FHx: noncontributory  Physical Exam: On admission to MICU: PE: Temp 97.4 P113 BP 76/54 (pre-levophed) RR 19 O2 sat 96 NC Gen - Alert, no acute distress, Russian-speaking elderly female, cachectic HEENT - PERRL, extraocular motions intact, anicteric, mucous membranes moist Neck - RIJ in place; nodules at base of left neck (tumors, per patient) Chest - Coarse breath sounds on right.
CV - Normal S1/S2, tachycardic, regular Abd - Soft, nontender, nondistended, with normoactive bowel sounds Back - No costovertebral angle tendernes Extr - Warm, with clubbing but no cyanosis.
2+ pitting edema bilaterally.
Multifocal airspace opacities, unchanged since the prior study, concerning for post-obstructive atelectasis or pneumonia.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
In the soft tissue windows, there is no axillary lymphadenopathy.
In the left thyroid lobe, there is a 4- mm calcification that is unchanged.
There are multiple masses within the mediastinum that are relatively unchanged.
Lesion #3 is a pretracheal lymph node measuring 23 x 18 mm and is unchanged.
Target lesion #4 is a subcarinal lymph node measuring 23 x 17 mm and is also unchanged.
In the lung windows, there is a mass in the left lower lobe as target lesion #1 measuring 37 x 34 mm and is also relatively unchanged.
There are multiple areas of focal patchy infiltrates bilaterally including geographic paramediastinal consolidations (presumably patient had prior radiation therapy) that are unchanged.
No new large pulmonary nodules are identified.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions that smaller than on prior study.
There is a pericardial effusion that is unchanged.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There are multiple hypodense lesions in the liver that are unchanged.
No new liver lesions are identified.
There is interval increase in a massive left nephrectomy bed lesion that now measures 107 x 104 mm that is, allowing for absence of IV contrast, increased from approximately 95 x 92 mm.
A large left adrenal mass measuring 5.7 cm is unchanged.
There is no free fluid in the abdomen.
IMPRESSION: Widely metastatic disease with interval enlargement of target  lesion #2 in the left nephrectomy bed.
Stable mediastinal ,lung, liver and left adrenal disease.
Head CT: ([**8-31**]) no mets .
CXR ([**11-22**]): Comparison to a prior chest x-ray shows certainly no improvement and possibly the increasing densities at both lung bases consistent with increasing pleural effusions.
Bilateral upper lobe airspace disease is present.
IMPRESSION: Increasing effusion since [**2164-11-20**].
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 68 year old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma admitted to MICU with hypotension.
1) Hypotension: Concern for infection and sepsis/SIRS physiology.
Potential sources of infection include post-obstructive pneumonia, UTI (given positive U/A).
Patient also has known large left adrenal mass.
Blood, sputum and urine cultures were sent and had no growth, and a repeat urine was negative for infection.
Steroids were also given, although the results of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**]-stim test did not support the idea of adrenal suppression.
2) Respiratory distress: On HD 2 the patient developed significant respiratory distress with bilateral wheezes/rales.
3) Code status: the patient had metastatic renal cancer and, per her oncologist, had always been resistant to discussions about advanced directives.
There were multiple discussions with her, her family, the MICU staff and her oncologist, with the resultant conclusion that she was DNR/DNI.
3) F/E/N: House diet, but patient had poor appetite and refused most food.
Most likely ACD secondary to malignancy.
5) Coagulopathy: INR>2, up from baseline; no active bleeding but given PO vitamin K with resulting INR=1.5.
Paxil Robitussin Methadose Ambien  Discharge Medications: None  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Hypotension Respiratory arrest Metastatic renal cell carcinoma  Discharge Condition: Expired
