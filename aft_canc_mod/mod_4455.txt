There is no vascular congestion or pleural effusions.
New right lower lobe pneumonia.
[**2196-3-18**] CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST: The evaluation of the mediastinum demonstrates several small non-pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
There is prominence of the left ventricle, in particular at the level of the apex.
Patient has anemia given the high density of the myocardium as compared to the blood in the cardiac [**Doctor Last Name 1754**].
The imaged portion of the upper abdomen demonstrates splenic calcification, nonspecific stranding in the perirenal area and otherwise is unremarkable within the limitations of the study that was not designed for evaluation of intra-abdominal pathology.
Airways are patent to the level of subsegmental bronchi bilaterally.
The evaluation of the lungs demonstrates new anterior segment of right upper lobe and posterior segment of right lower lobe and part of right middle lobe tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities as well as peribronchial opacities.
There are also nodules seen in left lower lobe, highly concerning for infectious process.
There is no pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
The major of those opacities might be consistent with bacterial etiology but invasive aspergillosis remains a possibility given nodular character of some of the findings, in particular one in the left lower lobe, 4:200, 186, in the right upper lobe, 4:87.
There are additional small pulmonary nodules that might be related or not related to the infectious process and some of them were present on the prior study.
There are no lytic or sclerotic lesions worrisome for infection or neoplasm, but extensive degenerative changes are noted throughout the spine.
New multilobular opacities consistent with infectious process.
Bacterial infection vs. invasive aspergillosis would remain high in the differential list.
[**2196-3-26**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect or acute territorial infarction.
There is extensive periventricular hypodensity compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
The ventricles and sulci are stable in size and configuration, demonstrating prominence most compatible with atrophic change.
There is no acute fracture.
The visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well pneumatized and aerated.
Note is made of atherosclerotic calcification in the bilateral carotid siphons.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
[**2196-4-5**] CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-31**], there is persistent and probably increasing opacification at the left base consistent with pneumonia.
Scattered areas of opacification are also seen in the right upper and lower zones, consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
No definite vascular congestion.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarction.
Unchanged chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
No enhancing lesion.
Brief Hospital Course: BMT course:64 yo male with relapsed AML s/p double cord transplant, who presented on C3D24 of dacogen on day of admission with fatigue and fevers found to have PCP pneumonia on bronch whose hospital course was complicated by right hip fracture and delirium.
# Fevers/Fatigue/Shortness of breath: Admission chest CT demonstrated bilateral infiltrates, and BAL was positive for PCP (patient had been noncompliant w outpatient PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]).
Pt started on 21 day course of Bactrim (20mg/kg/day of trimethoprim), first day [**3-30**], initially w increased O2 requirement and clinical worsening.
Follow-up CXR [**3-31**] demonstrated persistant bilateral pneumonia, but patient respiratory status improved and as transfered back to the floor.
MRI of the head, CT of the head and LP was unremarkable for a acute process.
EEG revealed a pattern of mild to moderate encephalopathy.
Patient was immediately evalauted and was noted to have a right shortened and externally rotated leg.
A family discussion with the [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy was carried out, after which he was confirmed DNR/DNI with stipulation that there be no escalation of care or ICU transfers.
# Transfusion Reaction: Patient was noted to have a raise in temperature of > 2 degrees during a blood transfusion.
Blood sample was sent to blood bank for review and patient was noted to have new anti-E antibody (see full transfusion work-up summary in OMR).
No changes were made to medications: - Hypertension - Chronic Kidney Disease [**Hospital Unit Name 13533**]: Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for worsening hypoxia.
Of note, CXR on [**3-31**] showed bilateral infiltrates but this was thought to be due to continued PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient went to the OR for replacement hip fracture on [**3-30**] with an uncomplicated surgery; there was concern for an extended NMJ blockade after surgery with hyperkalemia the subsequent day.
Patient had HCT drop after surgery, was given 2 U PRBCs with stable HCT after that.
He also had hypotension to 80s/50s overnight post-surgery, with IVF resuscitation.
Of note, the patient had delirium initially on tranfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] which improved somewhat after hip fracture repair.
