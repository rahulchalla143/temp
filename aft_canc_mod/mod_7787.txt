# R-sided pneumonia: A CXR showed a new right upper lobe extensive consolidation highly worrisome for rapid progression of infectious disease and minimal left basal atelectasis.
On the floor the patient complained to left-sided abdominal pain with radiation to his left shoulder.
The patient was given a 14 day course of vancomycin and cefepime for possible health-care associated pneumonia.
# Neutropenic Fever: On admission, U/A negative, no sign of mucositis or thrush on exam.
H/o C. Diff in [**5-/2130**]; BRBPR in past 24 hours prior to admit, and then with copious diarrhea on [**7-17**] after fluid resuscitation begun.
As per his BMT attending, pt has often had profuse watery diarrhea when he has neutropenic fevers after starting a cycle of chemotherapy, most of which (other than cdiff) never had a clear infectious cause.
Stool was sent for O&P, bacterial culture, viral culture (pt has hx of CMV retinitis but not colitis), microspora, cryptospora.
These revealed no stool infection.
The patient had one blood culture drawn from his line that grew out Coagulase negative staph; the line was treated with vancomycin dwells for 14 days.
The patient remained afebrile while on the floor.
# Hypotension - On admission BP 80/40's, minimally symptommatic with palpations and some lightheadedness with positional changes in setting of neutropenic fever, poor PO intake.
Likely volume depleted with high insensible losses from fever, possible septic shock, however no source located.
No e/o pericardial effusion (pulsus <10, heart size normal on CXR).
Pt was volume resuscitated throughout his course with LR boluses, never requiring pressors, and was transfused 6units PRBC as well.
Hemodynamically his hypotension resolved quickly, however he developed copious watery diarrhea on [**7-17**] and became tachycardic to the 130s (sinus) secondary to volume loss, for which he was again fluid resuscitated with LR with good response.
# Anemia - HCT 21.7 in setting of recent chemotherapy, presumed secondary to marrow suppression from chemotherapy.
Pt did present with BRBPR although this resolved quickly and no rectal exam was performed as he is neutropenic, guiaics are negative.
# Thrombocytopenia - plt of 18 on admission, trending down to 9.
# HIV associated Hodgkin's Lymphoma - s/p  five cycles of ADV (no bleomycin [**2-15**] emphysema).
The patient's counts started to recover during his hospital course, and he was no longer neutropenic and filgastrim was discontinued.
# AIDS - Patient has a history of CMV retinitis, esophagitis, disseminated [**Doctor First Name **], PCP [**2125**] treated with dapsone.
# Left lower quadrant abdominal pain: unclear etiology.
CT scan of the abdomen was done which showed no acute process.
There was some splenomegaly c/w previously known HIV-associated Hodgkin's Lymphoma involvement.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for fever and neutropenia (immune suppression) following chemotherapy.
Your fever was determined to be due to pneumonia.
Testing did not reveal any infection in your stool, and this is most likely due to the recent chemotherapy, as has happened in the past.
At first you had low blood pressure and were dehydrated, but as you recovered your blood pressure returned to [**Location 213**] levels.
You were continued on your usual medications to prevent further infection.
Start loperamide as needed for diarrhea.
Call if you have fevers, abdominal pain, or blood in your stools.
