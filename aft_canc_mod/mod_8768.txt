**************RADIOLOGY**************** CXR [**2147-2-3**] 10:23 PM IMPRESSION: No evidence for pneumonia.There is no significant change compared to previous.
MRI HEAD [**2147-2-3**] official read P, per neuro-onc there is no acute process or bleed  CTA chest [**2147-2-6**] 1.
No pulmonary embolism.
Unchanged appearance of bilateral pulmonary metastastes and dominant right upper lobe mass.
Left upper lobe pneumonia.
New left lower lobe collapse, which could be secondary to upward compression by new large volume ascites in the abdomen, or could be due to mucous plug, although no definite plug is visualized.
Small pericardial effusion, and trace left pleural effusion.
New large volume ascites.
New susceptibility artifact, perhaps from the right side of the mouth since the prior study of five days ago.
No central findings to explain the new facial nerve palsy.
Persistent fluid/mucosal thickening in the mastoid air cells bilaterally.
Assessment for meningitis or focal lesions like masses, metstases is limited due to lack of IV contrast.
No evidence of abscess, mass or lymphadenopathy.
No vascular abnormalities.
CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST  [**2147-2-10**] 12:44 PM Scattered tiny foci of soft tissue density in the frontal and ethmoid air cells.
Mucosal irregularity of the inferior turbinates bilaterally.
CT ORBITS, SELLA & IAC W/ CONTRAST  [**2147-2-14**] 11:24 AM No abnormality in the region of the temporal bone facial canal is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 49F with metastatic colon CA, s/p renal transplant, who p/w headache and SIRS.
Since she was hypotensive and tachycardic and had been suffering from N/V and poor po intake, we aggressively rehydrated her.
An LP was performed out of concern for meningitis.
On day of transfer to ICU, pt developed new hypoxia and fever, CXR was concerning for question of new retrocardiac infiltrate, vs effusion (volume overload with wt gain of >5 lbs since admission), so CTX was begun empirically (D1 = [**2-6**]).
A CTA chest was significant for LUL PNA along with LLL collapse and was negative for PE.
She was started on vancomycin and zosyn to cover for likely HAP and was weaned off of high flow 100% face mask down to 2 L nasal cannula on the day of transfer back to the OMED floor.
By time of discharge, had completed full course of antibiotics for presumed pneumonia and had been treated presumptively for C.dif until all cultures returned negative.
# Hypoxia - on [**2-6**] pt developed new desaturation to 88% on RA.
concern for infection (immunosuppressed), aspiration given patient's complaints of dysphagia (see below), and volume.
Additionally, for fear of volume overload, pt was given 40mg Iv Lasix (still urinates) and PD frequency was increased per renal team.
However, pt also developed sinus tachycardia to 140s.
In syndrome of sinus tach and hypoxia, PE was considered and pt was started on heparin gtt and ordered for stat CT-A.
She was transferred to the ICU overnight given concern for peri-septic physiology and worsening hypoxia.
The following day, her respiratory status had improved markedly and she was no longer hypotensive or tachycardic to the 130s.
She then completed an 8 day course of antibiotics for CAP and was weaned from oxygen.
Neuro exam without deficits, head MRI was negative for acute stroke or tumor.
Carotid dissection is considered given the unilateral nature of the symptoms.
However there is no cranial nerve palsy or Horner's syndrome.
Also concerning for meningitis given low-grade fever and photophobia but LP studies negative.
D/c'ed Zofran (side fx = HA).
Given concern for intracranial infectious vs malignant process, patient had two LP with cultures as described above, all negative.
Cytology did not reveal leptomeningeal tumor spread, though the sample may have been inadequate.
# Metastatic Colon CA: C1D1 of xeloda, xelox, and oxiplatin on [**2147-1-23**].
Deferring further oncological management currently.
# SLE - Stable as outpatient but consulted Rheumatology given concern that headache and neurological findings could be attributed to SLE.
# Multiple CN palsies - Left UMN CN 7, IX and likely L recurrent laryngeal nerve all acutely nonfunctional.
Repeat LP [**2-9**] with elevated inflammatory markers, lymphocytosis.
No lesion on MRI.
As above, no convincing evidence for meningitis.
MRI/MRA: No central findings to explain new facial nerve palsies.
CT sinus and CTA neck: no dissection or tracking sinusitis.
Head MRI with contrast [**2-13**] without anatomical explaination.
# Dysphagia: Pt c/o mild dysphagia.
No obvious lesion on MRI.
s/s evaluation was ordered and revealed profound dysphagia with multiple diet modification.
Was also seen by ENT for this issue which revealed new L vocal cord and pharyngeal paralysis.
No intervention was available.
