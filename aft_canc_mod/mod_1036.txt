Following discharge he remained short of breath, wheezy, and continued to have a productive cough at home.
He also developed neck pain and shoulder pain over day prior to this presentation.
On [**4-16**] he became febrile to 101.1F.
He was started back on neosynephrine, bolused a total of 5 liters, and started on heparin gtt given concern for pulmonary embolism.
He had atrial fibrillation with RVR to the 170's and BP again dropped to 70's.
Notably ECG showed ST depressions in V1-V4 which appeared similar to prior tracings.
He was seen by the cardiology fellow who suggested amiodarone if atrial tachycardia recurs.
Prior to this admission the patient was needing more supervision as he easily gets confused and was often disoriented.

DRUG MONITORING: [**2183-5-11**] 04:11AM BLOOD Vanco-20.9* [**2183-4-25**] 04:11AM BLOOD Digoxin-0.2*  Brief Hospital Course: HYPOTENSION: Patient was transferred from OSH after presentation for weakness and pre-syncopal episode in his driveway witnessed by his wife.
[**Name (NI) **] had notable systolic blood pressured in the 70s in ED at OSH prior to transfer and he needed to be placed on both levophed and neosynephrine initially.
Hypotension likely due to his later established MRSA bacteremia and sepsis.
CT done and no overt pulmonary emboli revealed to explain his marked hypotension.
He was also ruled out for acute coronary syndrome given his prominent cardiac history and multiple risk factors.
He also had rapid atrial fibrillation on day of admission which also contributed to poor cardiac output in setting of his already poor cardiac function with baseline EF of 35%.
During his ICU course he was weaned down to Levophed alone and then slowly taken off pressor support completely with gentle fluid boluses for occasional low blood pressures which were predominantly limited to the setting of him requiring amiodarone boluses or IV metoprolol pushes when his atrial fibrillation episodes occurred throughout his ICU stay.
Otherwise, blood pressures improved overall after patient had been adequately treated with IV Vancomycin for his MRSA bacteremia and MRSA pneumonia.
Initially felt that his right hand cellulitis from recent IV placement may have been possible source.
However, a sputum culture grew out MRSA within days of admission and his CXR had an area of patchy opacity in the lateral left lung on admission with was felt to  represent foci of pneumonia vs. aspiration.
During his hospital course he had immediate follow-up TTE and TEEs which were both negative for vegetations.
He was given a prolonged course of IV Vancomycin starting on [**4-17**] or MRSA bacteremia and MRSA pneumonia.
He continued to struggle with hypoxemia and shortness of breath and required re-intubation after additional hypercarbia developed on [**2183-4-30**].
Treated with additional Zosyn antibiotics for concern for additional aspiration PNA which may have triggered need for his second intubation.
He was given multiple IV Lasix PRN doses and even a Lasix drip at times to help accomplish diuresis for his ongoing pulmonary edema which was also another factor felt to be contributing to his poor respiratory status.
On [**2183-5-1**] had a bronchoscopy that showed area of small collapse in LUL with question of recurrent lung cancer so interventional pulmonology team consulted and after holding Plavix dose for about a week he had lung biopsy and repeat bronchoscopy which was consistent with malignant mass and pathology revealed squamous cell lung cancer.
A formal oncology consult was deferred in setting of his very tenuous status in ICU as team was waiting for patient to stabilize for formal consult and possible attempts for palliative radiation/medications but patient continued to clinically decline in ICU.
Overall, patient's persistent decline and respiratory failure felt to be combination of his underlying poor reserve with COPD /prior lobectomy, recent PNAs, recurrent lung cancer and pulmonary edema which lingered as well.
COPD EXACERBATION: Initially treated more aggressively with steroids and standing nebulizers.
COPD flare up was attributed to persistent pneumonia.
As above, respiratory failure required two intubations and multiple use of BIPAP and facemask at high flow to maintain oxygen saturations >88%.
Patient was also noted to have recurrent lung cancer and brain metastasis is also possible although patient was never stable enough to pursue any additional MRI or further workup for oncologic staging/management.
RAPID ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Patient had known atrial fibrillation in the past.
During his ICU course he had atrial flutter and fibrillation multiple times.
Patient's home regimen of quinidine stopped and he was loaded with IV amiodarone given his hemodynamic instability with rapid rhythm.
He was re-bolused with Amiodarone for ongoing SVT and later in hospital course metoprolol IV was added on a standing basis for additional control and worked well.
SWALLOWING: Failed speech and swallow.
PEG considered briefly but after goals of care discussion with family after recurrent lung cancer diagnosis and worse respiratory failure and progressive altered mental status the family wished to only keep patient comfortable and did not want any more surgeries.
[**Female First Name (un) **] ESOPHAGITIS: Thrush on admission with throat pain.
