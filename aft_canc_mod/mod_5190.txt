FINDINGS: Compared to the prior study, there is no evidence of progressive distention of the visualized bowel loops.
No abnormal gastric dilatation.
A shallow level of inspiration is demonstrated, but there are no significant interval changes versus prior.
Last study eval J-tube to rectum w/ no obstruction.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please place NGT into esophogas under fleuro (per picture) and eval to J-tube.
Previous evaluation of bowel from level of the J-tube to the rectum demonstrates no obstruction.
Contrast and bilious material was then aspirated via the sump at the conclusion of the procedure.
Holdup of contrast at the level of the esophagojejunal anastomosis, with dilated esophagus proximally and decompressed jejunum distally.
The findings suggest postoperative edema of the esophagojejunal anastomosis.
It revealed his anatomy consistent with his previous surgery as well as multiple small right sided pulmonary nodules and bilateral renal cysts.
Patient trasferred to ICU post-op for close respiratory and hemodynamic monitoring.
Activity- OOB to chair POD#1 and ambulation POD#2-Physical therapy following pt for entire hospitalization- progressed to Independent w/ ambulation w/ assist for  tube feedings and vac dressing machine assistance.
Wound noted to express small amount of purulent fluid, opened and I&D'ed at bedside revealing small pocket of pus.
Patient started on empiric vancomycin and levoflox at this time for a suspected wound infection.
Cultures returned positive for both Klebsiella and Pseudomonas, both pansensitive to patient's antibiotic regimen.
Patient's abdominal wound initially managed with wet to dry dressings but eventually changed to a VAC dressing.
At this time, patient's chest tube was removed with no complication.
Patient febrile overnight, CT torso performed which revealed small fluid collection in the left abdomen.
Patient defervesced but developed nausea and vomiting.
On POD #14 a nasogastric tube was placed with fluoroscopic guidance and contrast was instilled revealing postoperative edema of the esophagojejunal anastamosis site with slowing of contrast through this area.
Over the next few days, patient remained afebrile and stable with the NGT in place.
He had persistent spitting up of both clear and bilious material throughout the day as well as intermittent episodes of emesis.
He remained stable, however, and on POD #20, he did have a small bowel movement.
His episodes of emesis also resolved although he continued to spit moderate amounts of saliva mixed with bilious material throughout the day.
His wound continued to improve with each dressing change.
Neurologically his pain was controlled with dilaudid iv prn.
ID he remained afebrile and his antibiotics were discontinued prior to discharge.
Heme his Hct was stable with no evidence of bleeding.
GU he had adequate urine output with no diuretics.
On POD #27 a barium swallow was performed which demonstrated a patent esophagojejunostomy anastamosis site with no evidence of leak.
The patient was discharged to rehab with an abdominal JP in place as well as a VAC dressing.
