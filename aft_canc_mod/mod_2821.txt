Soft tissue window images demonstrate abnormal esophageal wall thickening in the distal esophagus with multiple lymph nodes which are at the upper limits of normal in size, but given its proximity to the abnormal esophagus, are also likely abnormal.
Additionally, there are moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left.
The left pleural effusion is loculated with a moderate supbulmonic component.
Additionally, there is subtle linear enhancement of the posterior surface of the left pleura.
There is bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right, associated with the bilateral pleural effusions.
In both upper lobes, there are geographic areas of opacity with traction bronchiectasis and scarring, likely relating to prior radiation therapy.
An ill-defined 5mm ground glass nodule is seen in the right middle lobe.
There are diffuse emphysematous changes in both lobes.
At the base of the right lung, there is an irregular area which likely represents atelectasis/scarring.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious sclerotic lesions are seen.
Abnormal thickening of the distal esophagus with adjacent lymphadenopathy, worrysome for malignancy.
Geographic areas of opacity in both upper lobes, consistent with prior radiation.
Subtle linear enhancement of the left posterior pleural surface.
While this could be due to radiation, given the history of lung cancer, pleural based metastatic disease is of high concern.
5 mm ground glass nodule in right middle lobe.
Bilateral moderate to large pleural effusions and associated bibasilar atelectasis.
The left pleural effusion appears loculated, with a moderate subpulmonic component, and there is associated complete collapse/consolidation of the left lower lobe.

[**2186-3-18**]  HIP UNILAT MIN 2 VIEWS RIGHT  REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:  Please assess R femur fracture  Again, demonstrated is a fracture of the right femoral neck with angulation at the fracture site.
No additional fractures are identified.
Extensive vascular calcifications are present.
Extensive vascular calcifications are again observed.
[**2186-3-18**]  L-SPINE (AP & LAT)  REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:  New-onset loss of L5 motor function, please assess for compression fx.
INDICATIONS:  Recent onset of loss of L5 motor function.
There is a mild compression deformity at the L4 vertebral body level.
Very minimal loss of height is noted at L5 as well.
The disk spaces are relatively well preserved with some mild narrowing noted at L3-L4.
Degenerative changes are noted posteriorly in the facet joints.
Extensive vascular calcifications are seen throughout the abdominal aorta and its branches.
Within the abdomen, note is made of multiple air filled loops of dilated bowel, which were also present on a recent CT of the abdomen of [**2186-3-9**], which described a small-bowel obstruction.
IMPRESSION: 1) Compression deformity at L4 and very minimal compression at L5.
2) Dilated loops of small bowel, concerning for small-bowel obstruction.
NONCONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no acute intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, or evidence of major vascular territorial infarction.
There is a generalized prominence of the sulci and ventricles consistent with brain atrophy.
Small likely lacunar infarcts are present in the periventricular white matter bilaterally.
There is no skull fracture.
There are dense carotid siphon calcifications.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Prior inferior wall myocardial infarction.
Probable prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Borderline low voltage.

The mediastinal and hilar contours are essentially unchanged with prominent opacity again seen at the left hilum.
The lungs show similar prominent interstitial markings, but the appearance is unchanged allowing for differences in technique.
There are no pleural or pericardial effusions.
IMPRESSION: No significant change since the prior study, or acute cardiopulmonary process.
