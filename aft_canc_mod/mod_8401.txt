Admission Date:  [**2101-4-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-4-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2031-11-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: OTOLARYNGOLOGY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7729**] Chief Complaint: Tongue Cancer   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2101-4-21**]: left hemiglossectomy, bilateral neck dissection, and split thickness skin graft   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 3065**] is a 69-year-old gentleman with a history of cT1N0M0 moderately differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue.
Given the extent of pain that he is in, he cannot allow for a full digital exam and it is very difficult to see between his tongue and jaw, so the tumor visibly approaches the midline.
No pathologic nodes were identified on CT scan.
Past Medical History: COPD atrial fibrillation diastolic congestive heart failure chronic kidney disease hypertension, glaucoma hyperlipidemia history of DVT.
Family History: His father had a history of throat cancer.
Intraoral surgical site with skin graft healing well with 100% take.
Neck soft and flat with minimal stable superior flap edema.
Minimal bibasilar crackles bilaterally.
The remainder of his hospital course by system:  ###HEENT: He was transferred to the floor with 2 JP drains in his neck and an intraoral bolster in place over the skin graft.
His neck incision healed well, although he developed some mild superior flap edema on POD#[**4-24**].
The staples were removed from his neck incision on POD#8, and the incision was healing well without evidence of dehiscence.
He also had a few minor intermittent episodes of confusion or forgetfulness consistent with delirium, but he was easily redirectable by his staff and family.
###CV: He was tachycardic postoperatively, and after his heart rate did not respond to adequate IV fluid boluses (as measured by an appropriate urine output), a medicine consult was obtained given his history of DVT/PE and cardiomyopathy.
An EKG showed sinus tachycardia, and a PE-protocol CT was performed.
This was negative for embolus but did show a right lower lobe pneumonia.
His tachycardia resolved over the next few days.
His antihypertensives were initially held, as he had some mild hypotension to the 80's and 90's.
###Pulm: He was diagnosed with a right lower lobe pneumonia after the PE-protocol CT on POD#1.
He remained stable on room air for his entire hospital course, although he did have a productive cough for the first few days.
Sputum culture eventually grew Citrobacter koseri and Enterobacter aerogenes, both sensitive to fluoroquinolones; commensal respiratory flora was absent.
He received standing nebulizer treatments for a few days with good effect and resolution of his cough.
After the bolster was removed on POD#5, he was evaluated by Speech and Swallow for possible initiation of an oral diet.
This showed a normal pharyngeal swallow but again, difficulty with oral preparation.
It was removed on POD#3 when his tachycardia had stabilized.
On POD#3, it was noted that he had asymmetric edema of his upper extremities, and ultrasound examination revealed a DVT in his left arm.
This was changed to IV ciprofloxacin for the right lower lobe pneumonia which was then changed to Zosyn and azithromycin the next day to cover for ventilator-associated pneumonia seen on PE-CT.  After 48 hours, he was changed to oral levofloxacin.
His CT scan showed incidental findings of left axillary lymphadenopathy and small pulmonary nodules.
