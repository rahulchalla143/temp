Admission Date:  [**2166-7-29**]              [**Month/Day/Year **] Date:   [**2166-8-7**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 87 yo female with h/o CAD s/p stent to the RCA, HTN, and recently diagnosed melanoma, who presented from [**Hospital1 **] with NSTEMI.
On [**7-27**], the patient developed chest pain which awoke her from sleep.
On Monday [**7-28**], pt re-developed the pain and was again treated with Maalox, this time with no relief.
She stated that the pain was sharp, [**7-9**], substernal, non-radiating, and occured at rest.
She had associated diaphoresis and shortness of breath.
This morning, the patient underwent Cardiac cath, which showed severe 3VD without an obvious culprit lesion.
She was also found to have severe LV diastolic heart failure (LVEDP of 35).
On arrival to the floor, the patient states that she is currently chest pain free.
She does complain of a headache, and she states that she feels subjectively short of breath (at her baseline).
Otherwise, the patient has no new complaints.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

OTHER PMH Mild dementia Mild chronic gastritis S/p melanoma resection x2, right groin and right thigh (dx'd 6 weeks ago) Recent inguinal LN dissection 10 days ago Anxiety/depression   Social History: The patient currently resides at a rehab facility, where she has been for the past 10 days s/p R inguinal LN resection.
Family History: Father died of MI in his 70s, Mother had DM2, Sister w/ colorectal cancer.

Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
JVD elevated to angle of jaw.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Bibasilar crackles to mid-lung field.
No wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Dressing on left femoral artery c/d/i SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Biphasic T waves in III and AVL.
Diffuse low voltage and poor R wave progression.
CARDIAC CATH: [**7-29**] Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed severe multivessel coronary artery disease.
There was diffuse disease of the  proximal-mid LAD to 50% before S1, a mid 65% lesion after S1 and S2 and before D1 and a bifurcation lesion involving mid-LAD at D1 which extended to a 90% diffuse lesion in the mid-distal LAD after D1 with twin distal LAD of only modest caliber and a D1 larger in caliber than the distal LAD.
The LCx was moderately calcified with anostial 30% and a proximal 50% lesion just before OM1.
Mid, serial 90-05% stenoses bracketing.
TTE [**7-30**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the distal half of the anterior septum and distal inferior and anterior walls.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
She presented to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH with chest pain and cardiac biomarker elevation, without significant ECG changes; consistent with NSTEMI.
Cardiac cath showed diffuse 3 vessel disease, with no culprit lesion identified.
In addition, the patient was felt to be a poor surgical candidate due to recent melanoma diagnosis.
The possibility of RCA stent was considered, but since patient had no severe wall motion abnormalities in the RCA territory, stent was not indicated.
It was held during this hospital course [**3-3**] hypotension and renal insufficiency.
Pt later became mildly hypotensive (SBP 90-100s) with slight improvement by the end of her hospital stay.
3.Acute on chronic diastolic and systolic CHF: The patient had evidence of elevated LVEDP in cath lab.
She continued to have evidence of volume overload including JVD, crackles on exam, and CXR showing mild-moderate pulmonary edema.
Patient then developed atrial fibrillation and hypotension, worse with sitting.
Lasix decreased to 5 mg and then stopped completely in setting of increasing creatinine, shift from fluid overload to euvolemia.
At present, pt appears to be euvolemic with weights of 60 kg and no peripheral edema.
Atrial fibrillation Patient developed new onset a fib on [**7-30**].
Patient was then started on amiodarone on [**2166-7-30**] since she did not appear to tolerate a fib, becoming intermittently hypotensive and diaphoretic.
UTI Patient had borderline fever and intense sweating on [**7-30**].
Urinary Retention: She has experienced urinary retention in the past and needed to have her foley replaced for retention of 600cc.
If urinary retention becomes a problem, would recommend urology consult as this problem has never been formally worked up.
[**Doctor First Name 48**] Patient's creatinine was 0.9 at admission and trended up to a maximum of 2.3 in the setting of hypotension and then lasix.
She sees an outside psychiatrist for her depression and should follow-up with this doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
If her depression worsens, she should be started on an alternate medicine.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: [**1-31**] Tablet, Sublinguals Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
[**Month (only) **] Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: NE Sianai At [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital [**Location (un) 686**]  [**Location (un) **] Diagnosis: Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction coronary Artery Disease Recent diagnosis of Melanoma Dementia Hypertension   [**Location (un) **] Condition: Improved.
Vital signs stable.
[**Location (un) **] Instructions: You were admitted with chest pain and found to have had a heart attack.
It was determined that open heart surgery (CABG) would not be helpful, given the anatomy of your heart vessels.
Your stay in the hospital was complicated by some inflammation around the heart that has since resolved, and some rhythm problems that your are still being treated for with medications.
Also seek medical attention if you develop any new fever, chills, trouble breathing, chest pain, nausea, vomiting or unusual stools.
