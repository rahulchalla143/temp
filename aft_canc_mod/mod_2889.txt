Evaluation included LFTs which were elevated and seemed consistent with obstructive biliary process (TBili 12.5; Alk Phos 343; ALT 168; AST 87).
En route, patient developed hypotension to 80s which responded to 2L IV fluid boluses.
This was c/w tumor ingrowth at the level of the ampulla.
Many stones ranging in size from 2mm to 5mm along with large amount of sludge that were causing obstruction were seen at the common bile and hepatic duct.
Patient was slightly lethargic but otherwise reported that he was doing well.
Abdominal pain was significantly improved.
Denied breathing difficulty or nausea.
Past Medical History: Pancreatic CA s/p metal stent placement [**2145**] HTN Asthma Diabetes Cholecystectomy Esophageal stricture  Social History: retired maintenance technician for the [**Company 2318**].
sclerae mildly icteric.
No fluid wave.
(stone extraction, stent placement)  Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed with no prior films available for comparison.
No sizeable right pleural effusion is demonstrated.
There is no pneumothorax.
Atrial fibrillation.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes.
No previous tracing available for comparison.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is a probable small (0.5x0.5cm) vegetation versus focal thickening on the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular systolic and diastolic function.
A possible small vegetation versus focal thickening of the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve.
LFT's and hyperbilirubinemia improved.
TTE was done that showed a small vegetaion on aortic valve vs thickened vale.
No clear source of strep pneumoniae bacteremia was found.
CXR - no pneumonia.
Was initially hypotensive andin ARF - both resolved with volume resuscitation.
Diagnosed with Afib: Was likely due to infection, septicemia.
However, he then became hypotensive after each dose of lopressor and lopressor was discontinued.
Given the penicillin allergy - no other appropriate alternative was recommended by them especially since the patient could have acute endocarditis.
The risk of infective endocarditis, need for potential IV and long term antibiotics, need for TEE, possibility of thromboembolic phenomena due to endocarditis and CVA, bacteremia, speard of infection to other parts of body and potentially death etc was explained to him and he comprehended the risks of leaving AMA.
Patient known to have unresectable pancreatic cancer on history.
Disp:*8 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home with Service  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Cholangitis, Bile duct obstruction Pneumococcal septicemia New-Onset Atrial Fibrillation Non sustained ventricular tachycardia Possible infective endocarditis Acute renal failure - resolved Secondary: Pancreatic Cancer (history of) Hypertension Diabetes mellitus type 2   Discharge Condition: Poor.
The ECHO shows that you may have an infection of the heart valve.
If this is indeed an infection of the heart vale or endocarditis, you are at a risk of worsening arrythmias, stroke, serious blood infection that may spread to other organs etc and potential death.
You had an infection of your biliary tree and a blocked stent.
You were also found to have bacteria in your blood.
You were found to have new arrythmia or irregular heart beat called atrial fibrillation.
Because of the fast and irregular heart rate, you are at an increased risk of clots being formed in the heart and causing a stroke etc.
YOu will likely need antibiotics for a long time if the diagnosis of endocarditis is confirmed.
