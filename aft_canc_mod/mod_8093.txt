ACTIVE PROBLEMS # Leukemia with Leukostasis: The patient was sent to the emergency department for vision changes associated with a WBC of 600k.
On admission, she was found to have blurry vision, and was transferred to the ICU for leukophoresis for presumed leukostasis retinopathy (later confirmed by ophthalmology - see below).
# Visual Changes: Red spot in right eye 3 weeks prior to admission suggestive of a retinal hemorrhage which has now resolved.
On admission, she reported ongoing blurry vision bilaterally which she thinks is improving.
She underwent leukophoresis for presumed leukostasis retinopathy, as above.
She was seen by ophthalmology of following leukophoresis, and was noted to have continued evidence of leukostasis retinopathy.
# Anemia and thrombocytopenia: Likely related to CLL.
# HTN: On HCTZ and ACEi at home.
With initiation of prednisone for leukostasis retinopathy, she began to require insulin sliding scale.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - Monitor blood sugar and consider initation of blood sugar lowering agents - Continue to monitor blood counts as outpatient - Complete treatment course of rituxan/bendamustine as per outpatient recommendations  Medications on Admission: HCTZ 12.5mg enalapril 5mg or 10mg (she is unsure) calcium  Discharge Medications: 1. hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Dear Ms [**Known lastname 110448**], during this admission you have been diagnosed with a condition called Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), you have received treatment with a chemotherapy called bendamustine on day [**5-18**] and [**5-19**].
