Admission Date:  [**2105-3-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2105-3-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2040-5-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2024**] Chief Complaint: Lower Extremity Edema  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 64 yo female, h/o metastatic breast cancer, presenting with new onset LE edema.
She was first diagnosed with her disease in the summer of [**2102**] where she had a mammogram showing suspicious microcalcifications in her left breast.
Pathology was consistent with invasive ductal cancer, poorly differentiated, with DCIS, ER/PR negative.
Of the ducts evaluated, they were consistent with papillomata.
She then had adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of Cytoxan, adriamycin, and taxol (her last taxol was [**11-10**]).
In [**1-10**], she had a CT that showed at least 6 brain mets, and she had a short course of XRT at that time (5 days of Rx).
Recent CT of the chest showed probable liver mets with a stable appearance of her left lung  (post-xrt changes).
CT of the brain on [**2105-2-20**] showed multiple enhancing masses, the most prominent in the left cerebellar region.
She was started on Lasix, advised to eat a low salt diet, and she was instructed to return to clinic in 1 week.
When she presented to clinic today, her LE edema was markedly worse, and she was also lethargic and confused.
She denies any SOB/CP/abdominal pain/blood in urine stool/dysuria/hematuria.
On presentation to clinic, she had a low grade fever, and when she got up to the floor, her temperature was 101.4.
Her LDH was elevated as well.
Chest X-ray was unchanged from prior (no pna, no effusion, edema, or infiltrate), and bilateral LE US were negative for DVT.
She presents for further management and work up of her fever and change in mental status.
Inflammatory breast cancer, with brain mets, s/p mastectomy, adjuvant chemotherapy, xrt to brain, now on herceptin, ?liver mets.

LE edema: there are several possible etiologies for this LE edema.
Other possible causes include heart failure; she had a normal TTE in [**3-13**], but it is possible she has developed systolic/diastolic dysfunction in the interim (can also be a side effect of herceptin).
Although her lungs show no evidence of edema, she could have right-sided failure accounting for her peripheral edema.
She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics from presumed sepsis from RLE cellulitis, fluid resuscitated, on pressors, and started on stress dose steroids (completed a 5-day course).
Dermatology was consulted regarding LE cellulitis and recommended covering for pseudomonas given the appearance (?echthyma gangrenosum), so she was changed to Vancomycin/Zosyn.
Aggressive diuresis was continued on the floor (she was grossly volume overloaded s/p fluid resuscitation in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]).
ID was consulted for the LE cellulitis and recommended better wound care, better glycemic control, continued antibiotics.
Plain film of the RLE was without evidence of osteomyelitis.
Her LE edema and cellulitis slowly improved with this care, and she was continued on Zosyn/vanco until discharge.
TTE in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] revealed new MR and right sided failure.
The etiology of this new heart failure was not determined (unlikely to have been solely the effect of her Herceptin therapy).
TTE was rechecked prior to discharge and found to be back to her baseline with improvement in biventricular function and no valvular abnormalities.
This lasix will need to be tapered as her edema resolves, and her Potassium will need to be monitored given this lasix therapy.
Repeat TTE prior to discharge showed resolution of the MR and new right-sided failure.
It was likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of infection, hypotension, and sepsis.
Her Herceptin therapy was held in-house secondary to her new heart failure.
Staging bone scan was obtained in-house showing increased uptake at multiple levels in the T-spine, but no other areas of probable metastatic disease.
HTN: Atenolol and HCTZ were initially held while in-house due to her hypotension and sepsis but were started prior to discharge with good blood pressure control.
CV: no evidence of CAD or CHF, but recent Herceptin therapy could cause this undesirable SE.
As above, TTE obtained showed new MR and right-sided failure.
The cause of her new heart failure was not determined (chemotherapy vs. an ischemic event).
Dispo: She was discharged to home with VNA services on PO antibiotics (Augmentin/Levofloxacin) after her RLE cellulitis had sufficiently improved.
Congestive Heart Failure Secondary Diagnoses: 1.
Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Good  Discharge Instructions: 1.
- We added Lasix, a medication to help take off some of the fluid and edema.
