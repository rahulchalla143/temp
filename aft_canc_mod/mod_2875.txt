Pt was recently hospitalized [**Date range (1) 58978**] for GIB which was managed conservatively since EGD at OSH was neg and colonoscopy revealed only nonbleeding polyps and tics.
During that hospitalization he had elevated troponins so he was taken to catherizationa and his RCA and L circumflex arteries were stented with plan for one month of plavix.
Plan was made for follow-up with general surgery for a large sessile polyp in the ascending colon which could not be removed with colonocopy and was thought to be contributing to his bleeding.
He reported generalized weakness and mild DOE but otherwise was feeling well.
)Cerebrovascular disease with lacunar infarcts, s/p left CEA 4.
Family History: Pt has son with DM, brother with MI in 50's.

Interval development of a small amount of fluid in the left paracolic gutter, surrounding the spleen and liver, and adjacent to some loops of small bowel in the left abdomen and adjacent to the hepatic flexure.
There is no abnormality of the adjacent bowel that is identified.
No free air or spillage of contrast is detected.
The findings may correlate non-specifically with recent colonoscopy.
Slight gallbladder wall thickening and non-specific stranding about the gallbladder and pancreas.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
However, other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Slight gallbladder wall thickening, but no wall edema or gallbladder distention.
If there is strong suspicion of cholecystitis, biliary scintigraphy could be helpful.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2174-3-12**] 7:25 AM There is cardiomegaly with tortuosity of the aorta and slight pulmonary, vascular engorgement, possibly related to CHF or fluid overload.
There is flattening of the diaphragms consistent with COPD.
Brief Hospital Course: 83 yo male w/hx of CAD s/p recent PTCA, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD s/p CEA and AAA repair, prostate CA s/p radiation tx, afib- off coumadin admitted [**3-9**] for falling hematocrit and melena.
Pt has also known diverticuli although they were also not bleeding on recent scope.
Small bowel has never been evaluated since recent CT was without oral contrast and no SBFT performed.
Given hx of melena with no BRBPR despite 2 unit Hct drop over the last month, elevated BUN, we were more suspicious of UGI source although EGD neg.
Pt was evaluated by surgery in the ED and feel that polyps aren't a likely source of the bleeding and consider the patient a high surgical risk.
Patient underwent colonoscopy, and multiple polys were removed without complication.
However, one day following colonoscopy, patient became hypotensive and ill-appearing with mild abdominal pain and was transferred to the intensive care unit for closer monitoring for concern of micro-perforation vs. bleed.
Of note, CT abdomen/pelvis revealed no free air, however did reveal pericolic fluid of unknown significance as well as some mild gallbladder wall thickening and fat stranding of also unknown significance.
Patient underwent surgical evaluation with concern for cholecystitis vs. bowel microperforation.
Patient became acutely tachycardic to 140s-150s, with SBP 90s-100s, and was thought to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response secondary to adrenergic stress from infection vs. blood loss.
At that point, it was felt that adequate evaluation of patient's volume status in the form of central venous pressure was necessary, and central line placement was offered to patient.
Coronary artery disease: Patient had recently undergone catheterization with placement of multiple bare metal stents and was initially started on Plavix, however, this was later held due to continued symptomatic GI bleeds.
During this hospitalization, patient had no chest pain.
ECG showed ST depression in v [**3-20**] but this is unchanged from previous, and cardiac enzymes were negative.
Of note, aggressive managment of patient's episode of AFIB/RVR was undertaken despite no hemodynamic compromise given concerns of demand ischemia.
ARF/diarrhea likely secondary to dehydration from bowel prep for colonoscopy and over-diuresis with lasix.
Patient had elevated lactate concerning for ischemic bowel or bowel perforation from colonoscopy.
CT abd neg for free air or ischemic colitis.
Of note, patient did have at urinary tract infection concerning for urosepsis, however, following IV hydration, gap acidosis corrected.
This was an appropriate decision as further interventions required for his care would have been fairly aggressive in the setting of poor cardiovascular and hemodynamic status.
