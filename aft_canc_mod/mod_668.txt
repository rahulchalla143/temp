Clot is noted in the pulmonary bifurcation c/w cell embolism.
Minimal emphysematous changes b/l.
Focal area of low attenuation in the spleen.
Report from OSH - R-LENI: negative for DVT .
CXR [**10-20**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process .
There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Agitated saline contrast study is consistent with the presence of an intracardiac shunt (likely stretched patent formamen ovale or small atrial septal defect).
Coarse liver echotexture, which may represent fatty infiltration or cirrhosis/fibrosis.
Heterogenous signal intensity in the liver with varices seen in the left upper quadrant suggests the presence of chronic liver disease.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 64 yo M with h/o COPD presented to OSH c/o RLE swelling x2 days and SOB.
He was found to have a large saddle PE and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] on a heparin drip for futher management.
# Pulmonary embolism: He presented from OSH with CTA showing extensive b/l pulmonary emboli with large amount of clot in distal R main pulmonary artery.
EKG did not show evidence of right heart strain.
TTE showed normal EF >55%, mildly dilated right ventricle with normal free wall contractility, mildly dilated aortic root, as well as intracardiac shunt (likely patent formamen ovale or small atrial septal defect).
Of note, OSH CTA also showed splenic infarct.
Per history, he did not have known precipitating factors for pulmonary embolism (no personal or family history, hx of malignancy, recent prolonged travel).
Hypercoagulability work-up was deferred for outpatient.
# Hepatic mass/hemangioma: As per old records, patient worked up for possible HCV due to ?positive Ab testing.
Per OSH records, pt had longstanding history of thrombocytopenia with platelets in this range.
RUQ was obtained that showed ill defined hepatic lobe mass and coarse liver echotexture concerning for fatty infiltration or cirrhosis/fibrosis.
MRI of the liver was obtained to further evaluate that showed cirrhosis and hemangioma  #Pancreatic Tail Cyst: found incidentally on MRI of liver --recommended to have repeat MRCP in 1 year  #Incidentally found R adrenal nodule (7mm) found on MRI of liver --defer further workup to PCP as an outpatient  #Splenic infarct-Pt was found to have a small ASD vs. stretched PFO on echo.
This could have been due to an embolus.
?Hep C history but review of prior notes suggest +ab but negative VL.
Did not appear to have evidence of any clinical decompensated cirrhosis during admission.
Most likely secondary to smoking.
# Thrombocytopenia Etiology unclear, but appears to be a chronic process as thrombocytopenia dated back several years.
He did not have evidence of active bleeding.
# COPD No interventions at this time.
# Hyperglycemia Pt did not have hx of diabetes.
Disp:*30 Patch 24 hr(s)* Refills:*0* 4. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) puffs Inhalation three times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred from another hospital for continued evaluation and management of a large pulmonary embolus (blood clot).
You would benefit from continued evaluation of a liver specialist as well.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 1) Recommend repeat MRCP in one year to evaluate 5mm cyst found in tail of pancreas 2)management of anticoagulation 3)evaluation by hepatologist for possible cirrhosis and varices 4)evaluation by hematologist for possible hypercoag workup.
Please ask your doctor to refer you to a hematologist to review possible hypercoagulable conditions and also a referral to a hepatologist (liver specialist) to review the condition of your liver.
