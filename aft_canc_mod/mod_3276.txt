Admission Date:  [**2167-1-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2167-2-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2085-11-30**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Codeine / Ativan  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**] Chief Complaint: Cardiopulmonary arrest  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Tracheostomy and G-tube on [**2167-2-5**] L PICC on [**2167-1-27**]  History of Present Illness: This is an 81 y/o female with history of obesity, HTN, IDDM, who presented to the ED with cardiac arrest after having a witnessed collapse earlier today.
CPR was initiated and recheck of the rhythm revealed bradycardia and hypotension.
Pt was given 2 gm of CTX and 500 mg of Azithromycin for consolidation seen in LUL.
CXR also demonstrated a low ETT, which was pulled back appropriately.
CT torso significant for LUL consolidation only.
Per family, the pt had GI symptoms of primarily diarrhea last week, without any fevers, abd pain, n/v.
This had resolved, but for the last two days, the pt had been complaining of SOB, primarily difficulty breathing when laying down (+orthopnea, +PND).
No prior h/o lung disease or cardiac history.
Has not had these symptoms previously.
HTN 2.
DM - on insulin 3.
Glaucoma 5.
Dried blood in mouth and on tongue.
Neck: supple, unable to determine JVD given thickness of neck Chest: decreased BS over bases b/l, coarse rhonchi b/l CV: RRR, s1 s2 normal, no m/g/r Abd: obese, NT, NABS Ext: trace edema b/l, warm extremities Neuro: Sedated, withdraws to pain but not arousable to voice.
Anisocoria of pupils (?new) with no reactivity.
Traumatic stranding anterior to thyroid.
Extremely limited examination due to habitus and patient positioning.
No central pulmonary embolism or definite aortic dissection.
Left lobe consolidations suggestive of aspiration.
Right large pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.
Small amount of free fluid around the gallbladder, liver, and in the pancreas, likely from fluid overload.
4.7 cm exophytic round lesion adjacent to the left aspect of the lower uterine segment ?
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Again there is a suggestion of lucency within the right paratracheal region, which may represent a small amount of air within the mediastinum.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is a stable small right pleural effusion, and mild pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: # Cardiopulmonary arrest - EMS notes indicated that the patient was found with agonal breathing, but initially in sinus bradycardia at a rate of @ 34 with a palpable pulse.
A primary cardiac event was felt unlikely.
There was no evidence of ischemia by cardiac biomarkers.
There was no evidence of pulmonary embolus by CT angiography.
There was no evidence of adrenal insufficiency by cosyntropin stimulation testing.
# Respiratory failure - Patient was intubated during her cardiopulmonary arrest.
After a prolonged intubation, she remained difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation.
Although she was not previously known to have lung disease, she had evidence of chronic CO2 retention.
She was discharged to an acute care facility for weaning from mechanical ventilation.
# Atrial tachycardia - Patient was noted to have paroxysms of atrial tachycardia during this hospitalization.
She tolerated the tachycardia with stable blood pressures.
Given her respiratory status, diltiazem was started with the goal of weaning down her metoprolol.
# Alkalosis - She was noted to have a transient alkalosis in the setting of lasix diuresis.
# Elevated transaminases - She had a mild elevation in her transaminases on admission, felt likely to reflect hepatic ischemia in setting of hypotension during her cardiopulmonary arrest.
# Glaucoma - she was continued on her home regimen of eye drops.
# Diabetes - she was initially on subcutaneous insulin.
# F/E/N - She received tubefeeds as Promote, 60cc/hr.
# Prophylaxis - She received subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis and an H2 antagonist for GI prophylaxis.
# Access - A left-sided PICC was placed by interventional radiology on [**2167-1-27**].
# Communication - with daughter [**Name (NI) **]  Medications on Admission: 1.
Olanzapine 2.5 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for agitation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **]- [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: s/p asystolic cardiac arrest Respiratory failure s/p tracheostomy and G-tube placement Pneumonia Atrial tachycardia   Discharge Condition: good, stable on ventilator   Discharge Instructions: Please take all of your medications as prescribed.
