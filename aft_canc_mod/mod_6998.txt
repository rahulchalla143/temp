Admission Date:  [**2137-2-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-2-27**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: Right AVF thrombosis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: AVF revision/thrombectomy  History of Present Illness: 86M with ESRD on HD admitted for fistula thrombectomy, which occurred yesterday, now with systolic BP in 70s at dialysis, chest pain, EKG changes with ST depressions in V3-V5.
Pt still having L arm numbness.
Pt states that chest pain is substernal, worse with deep inspiration, feels like a hammer pounding into his chest.
Does have some numbness in his L arm which he says is intermittent.
Chest pain has stayed constant since its onset around noon.
Pt's BP dropped at HD last Saturday to 60s-70s [**Name8 (MD) **] RN (per records, in 80s) but he did not have any chest pain.
Feels that his chest pain is similar to chest pain in past that resulted in CABG x4.
The most exertion pt performs at home is climbing a flight of stairs, which results in no chest pressure but he has been getting more short of breath.
Per cards, no evidence of CHF and no regional wall motion abnormalities on echo - appears dry.
Pt also has h/o NHL, s/p chemo and rituxan, and per oncologist is not active.
Pt also has not had BM x3 days, concern for gastric dilatation.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p CABG x4 [**2128**] ESRD with R AVF HTN Hyperlipidemia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate Ca Seizure d/o PVD Lumbar stenosis and disk herniation   Social History: Patient currently lives with his wife.
General: Patient is an elderly male, + chronic sun exposure/hyperpigmented skin, pleasant, tired, in NAD HEENT: NCAT, EOMI.
MMM, no lesions Neck: JVP visible, approximately 6cm Chest: Mild course expiratory breath sounds, no focal rhonchi, wheezes, crackles anterior or laterally.
II/VI systolic murmur, loudest at RUSB Abdomen: Mildly distended, mildly tender diffusely but without rebound or guarding.
Sutures intact, no erythema.
Hyperenhancing left renal mass, which may represent lymphoma or RCC.
Multiple new pulmonary nodules in the left lung as described.
Left adrenal mass.
Small bilateral pleural effusions .
[**2137-2-19**]  Echo: Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Technically limited study due to poor acoustic windows.
Preserved global/regional left ventricular systolic function.
No structural valve disease.
No pericardial effusion.
[**2137-2-20**]: Chest Pa/Lat - FINDINGS:  Compared to [**2137-2-19**], allowing for differences in technique and rotation, no acute process or significant interval change identified.

This was thought possibly to occur in the setting of blood loss related to AV fistula thrombectoy.
[**Hospital 38133**] hospital course also notable for abdominal pain.
No leaking AAA or similar seen, but a left renal mass was observed, possible concerning for recurrent lymphoma vs. RCC.
Hypotension - As above, the likely etiology of the patient's hypotension was bleed from surgery.
On the floor the patient remained normotensive and eventally a low dose beta-blocker was added given his recent NSTEMI which he tolerated well.
NSTEMI - As above, the patient experienced an NSTEMI in the setting of hypotension and Hct drop.
Given his hypotension and bleed a beta-blocker and heparin drip were held.
He had no further events on the floor.
However, multiple co-morbidities may defer further evaluation or invasive procedures regardless.
As above, the patient may additionally benefit from addition of an ACE if his BP remains WNL.
Patient was not initiated on anti-coagulation given Hct drop, and hypotension earlier this admission.
Consideration towards initiation of anti-coagulation should be performed as an outpatient after acute illness resolved with consideration towards embolic risk as well as malignancy and recent bleeding event, although this likely occurred in the setting of surgical procedure.
Anemia - The patient received 3U PRBCs during the MICU course, after his thrombectomy.
On the floor his hematocrit remained stable and was closely followed and his iron studies revealed a component of anemia of chronic disease.
Renal Mass - The patient's renal mass is concerning for recurrent lymphoma vs. RCC.
Per conversation with MICU team, the patient's treating Oncologist is aware of the renal mass and is being followed.
Unfortunately, given multiple medical comorbidities, patient not thought to be a likely candidate for therapy regardless of etiology.
ESRD on HD - The patient received dialysis with his new fistula with no complications.
Seizure disorder - The patient was continued on Phenytoin per outpatient regimen.
New 4.6 x 4.8 cm left renal mass.
New 3.5 x 3 cm left adrenal mass.
Multiple new left pulmonary nodules.
Blood loss anemia.
Low grade NHL.
CAD s/p CABG.
