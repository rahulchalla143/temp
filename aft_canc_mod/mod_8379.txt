Admission Date:  [**2149-7-30**]     Discharge Date:  [**2149-8-7**]  Date of Birth:   [**2085-4-15**]     Sex:  M  Service:  C-MED  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old gentleman without was transferred from the Coronary Care Unit secondary to a hypotensive episode which was treated with dopamine and had dyspnea which had resolved in the Coronary Care Unit.
He has a history of metastatic esophageal cancer treated with radiation therapy.
His hypotensive episode happened a couple of days ago; at which point he was taken to the Emergency Department and cardioverted secondary to an atrial flutter with a hypotensive episode.
His blood pressure transiently improved, but it required monitoring, and the patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit secondary to a decreased blood pressure again.
Metastatic esophageal cancer with radiation therapy.
Atrial flutter.
Hypothyroidism 6.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Vital signs on admission revealed his temperature was 98.3 degrees Fahrenheit, his blood pressure was 137/83, his heart rate was 75, his respiratory rate was 18, and his oxygen saturation was 95% on room air.
Physical examination on transfer revealed the patient was in no acute distress.
No jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular examination revealed irregularly irregular heart sounds.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Extremity examination revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
The abdomen was nontender and nondistended.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient is a 64-year-old gentleman with a history of metastatic esophageal cancer with atrial flutter awaiting transesophageal echocardiogram with cardioversion who was admitted to the C-MED Service.
METHICILLIN-RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS PNEUMONIA ISSUES:  He had a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, but his lungs were clear to auscultation.
INCREASED INR ISSUES:  He had an increased INR.
for pain with a Fentanyl patch 100 mcg transdermally q.72h.
He had a slight increase in his creatinine which was closely monitored.
He also had some muddy casts; all consistent with an acute tubular necrosis.
On [**2149-8-3**], the patient was cardioverted chemically because of atrial fibrillation that persisted and was coming back and was making the patient's heart rate go up anywhere from the 120s to 140s.
The patient was hemodynamically stable and without any complaints.
He was then monitored closely for Q-T elevation throughout the day and without any difficulties and was awaiting electrophysiology procedure the next morning.
On [**2149-8-4**], the patient continued to have his acute renal failure; most likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis.
On [**2149-8-4**], the patient had an atrial fibrillation ablation done but then the patient was back into atrial fibrillation since.
He was sent out for liver function tests and pulmonary function tests; which were pending, with a goal heart rate of less than 100 consistently and with the hope of cardioverting him with amiodarone over time.
His increased creatinine was starting to improve, so his acute renal failure was improving; which was most likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis given that his fractional excretion of sodium was 3%; consistent with an acute tubular necrosis picture.
For his methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, he still continued to receive his vancomycin without difficulty.
Hypertension needs to be better controlled and dose adjusted by his primary care physician to then be discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] when the patient saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] the next week.
The patient's pain was well controlled while in the hospital with a Fentanyl patch and with oxycodone.
In case of an emergency or not feeling well, the patient was advised to seek medical attention as soon as possible.
The patient also had a follow-up appointment with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**] on [**2149-8-18**] to discuss [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts monitor results.
Atrial fibrillation.
Status post right atrial fibrillation ablation.
MAJOR INVASIVE/SURGICAL PROCEDURES:  Ablation; right atrial isthmus for atrial flutter.
as needed (for low back pain); the patient was instructed not to exceed 16 pills daily and hold if there were any signs of respiratory problems.
