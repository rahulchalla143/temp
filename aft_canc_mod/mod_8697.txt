Admission Date:  [**2153-2-1**]     Discharge Date:  [**2153-2-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2091-6-10**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old gentleman who initially presented in [**2152-11-23**] with back, and abdominal pain, and fevers.
He continued to have pain and eventually had a computed tomography scan of the abdomen which showed a 7-cm left pericolic abscess and thickening of the splenic flexure.
He underwent computed tomography-guided drainage of the abscess collection that grew out enterococcus in two strains; of which one was vancomycin resistant.
One month following (on [**2153-2-1**]), he again noticed abdominal pain with chills and cramping with emesis.
He had a follow-up computed tomography which demonstrated another abscess adjacent to the previously drained collection was noted on repeat computed tomography done at this time.
Of note, the patient had grown vancomycin-resistant enterococcus from the prior collection that was drained in [**Month (only) 404**].
Diabetes mellitus.
Coronary artery disease.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A computed tomography of the abdomen showed an increase in the left upper quadrant fluid collection with a significant amount of air and fluid; consistent with an abscess with the percutaneous catheter inferior and posterior, and no communication with between the abscess collection and the percutaneous drain.
He was taken to the operating room on [**2153-2-6**] where he underwent a en bloc excision of the abdominal tumor with a transverse colectomy, partial gastrectomy, splenectomy, and distal pancreatectomy.
Intraoperatively, they found a large intra-abdominal tumor involving the above-mentioned strictures in transverse colon and splenic flexure as well as the transverse mesocolon.
An intraoperative gastroscopy was done which showed no mucosal lesion, but the lesion was found to be clearly adherent to the stomach.
However, on postoperative day two, he spiked a fever to 101.2, and his epidural catheter was removed by the Acute Pain Service.
He was changed to intermittent boluses of Dilaudid for pain which he tolerated well.
After extubation, he had minimal pain receiving only intermittent doses of Dilaudid; however, he did have some episodes of confusion and persistent pulling out of his nasogastric tube.
However, on postoperative day 12, he had an episode of acute confusion and was given Narcan, and all of his narcotics were discontinued.
He had a completely nonfocal examination.
CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient reported a history of bronchospasm with beta blockers, and thus was maintained on a diltiazem drip for heart rate control.
Just out of the operating room had an increasing oxygen requirement because of decreased oxygen saturations and an increased positive end-expiratory pressure requirement.
A chest x-ray was consistent with mild congestive heart failure.
He subsequently developed a left lower lobe opacity, and a sputum culture grew out multiresistant Klebsiella, for which he was changed to meropenem.
However, he continued to have a significant oxygen requirement and continued to have low-grade temperatures.
He did have one episode of hypoxia, as previously mentioned, when he was on the floor associated with his acute confusion with a saturation of 73% on room air.
However, on chest x-ray he continued to have a left lower lobe opacity/consolidation consistent with a ventilator associated pneumonia.
After he stabilized from a respiratory standpoint, this was removed, and he was started on an oral diet.
Because of a persistently elevated white blood cell count, he underwent an abdominal computed tomography on [**2-17**] which showed some consolidation of the left lung base and a small amount of ascites around the liver, but no evidence of an abscess or drainable collection.
Because he continued to have a persistent white count, his [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] fluid was sent for culture, and this subsequently grew out vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and his antibiotic regimen was changed.
Of note, the patient had two [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains placed postoperatively; however, during an episode of acute confusion one was inadvertently removed and the second one was damage.
GENITOURINARY ISSUES:  The patient received several fluid boluses during the early postoperative hours for a low urine output.
He initially had a poor response, but by postoperative day five started to make significant urine and was changed to a Lasix drip.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  As stated above, the patient received multiple fluid boluses for low urine output during postoperative days one through two.
He tolerated goal tube feeds throughout most of his hospital course and has now been changed to an American Diabetes Association diet.
However, of note, he developed a significant metabolic alkalosis around postoperative days nine to ten which was thought to have precipitated his bicarbonate retention.
ENDOCRINE ISSUES:  The patient was initially placed on an insulin drip due to a high serum glucose.
He was changed over to NPH when his tube feeds were at a steady state with an accompanying sliding-scale; however, he needed intermittent periods with an insulin drip due to difficult glycemic control.
His oral hypoglycemics were restarted on [**2-21**]; however, he continued to have elevated glucose levels.
HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  He was transfused 2 units of blood preoperatively, and postoperatively remained stable with the exception of transfusion of 2 units for a hematocrit of 26 and 27 from presumed blood loss anemia.
His hematocrit stabilized, and he needed no further transfusions throughout his hospitalization.
For deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, he was placed on three times per day subcutaneous heparin at a dose of 5000 units.
However, due to his obesity and immobility, he was considered at high risk and changed to Lovenox 30 twice per day on postoperative day eight.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  As stated above, the patient presented with fevers and had fevers preoperatively as well.
The initial abscess, as stated above, had grown two species of enterococcus of which one was vancomycin resistant.
These grew alpha strep, two species of gram-negative rods, and again probable enterococcus.
Because of his persistent fevers and elevated white blood cell count, vancomycin was started on [**2153-2-8**] to provide additional coverage for Enterococcus.
He continued to have low-grade fevers and an elevated white blood cell count.
His sputum culture from [**2-8**] grew Klebsiella pneumoniae that was highly resistant and essentially only sensitive to meropenem to cover him for a ventilator associated pneumonia.
He was noted to have some drainage from the right lateral portion of his incision which was initially serosanguineous only with turning; however, it progressed to a thick purulent appearing material and on postoperative day eight the wound was opened at the bedside.
The fascia was intact, and a moderate amount of serosanguineous and fatty fluid was drained, but no large collection of pus was encountered.
He was maintained on wet-to-dry dressing changes; however, the swab from that incision grew Klebsiella that was gain highly resistant and enterococcus that was resistant to levofloxacin, and penicillin, and ampicillin and sensitive to vancomycin.
However, one of these grew out vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.
TUBES/LINES/DRAINS:  He currently has [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain in his left upper quadrant that will remain in place and a left subclavian triple lumen catheter.
Large abdominal tumor; status post en bloc resection.
Status post partial gastrectomy.
Diabetes mellitus.
Blood loss anemia; resolved.
Intra-abdominal abscess; status post percutaneous drainage.
