Admission Date:  [**2118-3-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-3-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-8-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6021**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Abdominal port placement [**2118-3-21**]   History of Present Illness: 54 y/o woman with metastatic ovarian cancer complicated by ascites requiring frequent paracentesis who is admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU after presenting to the emergency department with dyspnea.
Her ascites has been a [**Last Name 12785**] problem of late, and has required 2 paracentesis last week alone.
She awoke on the day of admission (Sunday [**2118-3-20**]) feeling short of breath, and with abdominal distension, and noted that this was similar to how she feels prior to paracentesis.
She has not had any acute abdominal pain, but notes a bloating and a tightness sensation.
She vomited once last night after eating and has had poor PO intake at baseline.
She has had no chest pain.
A CT torso was performed in the ED which demonstrated no PE/dissection, but progression of omental/peritoneal disease with pockets of hyperdense ascites in LUQ and mid line lower abdomen which likley represent intraperitoneal hemmorhage mixed with ascites.
Ovarian Cancer Diagnosed with Stage I in [**2115-7-11**] with good surgical resection.
Had recurrent disease in [**2116-10-10**] and had gemcitabine, 7 cycles taxol, 4 cycles doxil, and started Alimta on [**2118-2-23**].
Anxiety disorder followed by a psychiatrist 3.
Hypertension after treatment with Avastin 4.
Both her sister and brother have had basal cell carcinoma of the nose.
There is no history of any breast, ovarian, uterine, or colorectal cancer.
No evidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism.
Interval disease progression involving the peritoneum and omentum within the abdomen and pelvis with increased ascites.
Pockets of ascites appear to display hyperdense components within it, noted within the left upper quadrant and lower midline abdomen which are suggestive of regions of intraperitoneal hemorrhage.
No findings of active extravasation.
Unchanged intrathoracic and abdomen/pelvic lymphadenopathy.
Slightly prominent air- and fluid-filled loops of transverse colon without any secondary signs to suggest bowel obstruction.
No evidence of active extravasation.
Stable appearance of known extensive metastatic disease with ascites, peritoneal and omental implants.
Stable appearance of high attenuation components in left upper quadrant within the ascites suggestive of regions of intraperitoneal hemorrhage.
Interval development of small-to-moderate right pleural effusion.
Dilated loops up to 7 cm of air and fecal material filled transverse and ascending colon, and cecum that is compatible with ileus.
# Anemia:  Patient presented with a hematocrit of 16 in the setting of recent chemotherapy and no clear source of acute bleeding.
An abdominal CT was performed and demonstrated ascitic fluid consistent with focal areas of hemorrahage from metastatic disease.
This was thought to be the etiology of the patient's acute anemia and she was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for close monitoring.
On the floor patient had 1 L of fluid drained from abdominal port for comfort - the next day she had > 15 pt HCT drop (30.4 -> 15.7).
CTA was performed which demonstrated no active source of bleeding from vessels.
Again it was felt 15 HCT was erroneous and perhaps due to dilution (port draw).
Regardless patient is suffering from intraperitoneal bleeding demonstrated by frank blood (drained from abdominal port).
CTA ruled out treatable vascular source, most likely bleeding is from metastatic peritoneal disease.
There is some concern that removing fluid for comfort increases peritoneal bleeding due to decreased pressure/tamponade.
HOwever, prior to discharge 500 cc X 2 was drained with no significant drop in HCT or change in hemodynamics.
# Ascities:  The patient has significant ascites and has undergone multiple therapeutic paracentesis to relieve dyspnea and abdominal discomfort.
Patient was briefly started on antibiotics (Vanc, Ceftrioxone) for possible intrapertineal infection based on PMN 249 ([**2118-3-22**]), however culture returned negative and antibiotics were discontinued.
# History of DVT/PE: Lovenox discontinued in setting of intraperitoneal hemorrhage.
