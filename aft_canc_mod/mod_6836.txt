FINDINGS: Comparison to the previous study, there is new bilateral lower lobe airspace opacity with increased bibasilar atelectasis.
Increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs suggest superimposed pulmonary edema.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Increased bibasilar and infrahilar airspace consolidation with diffuse interstitial pattern throughout the lungs suggests consolidation with some possible superimposed pulmonary edema.

There are no other areas concerning for acute hemorrhage.
There is no shift of normally midline structures and no mass effect.
[**Doctor Last Name **]- white matter differentiation remains well preserved and there is no acute vascular territorial infarction.

No other foci of hemorrhage or shift of midline structures.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: Other diagnostic considerations include hemorrhage at site of the enhancing intra-axial lesion, demonstrated on the [**2153-9-6**] MR, or partial thrombosis of the adjacent transverse and proximal sigmoid sinus.

FINDINGS: The right cerebellar enhancing lesion which measures 1.6 x 0.9 cm is unchanged in size and appearance.
There has been interval increase in the T2/T1 hyperintense extra-axial collection with associated mixed high and low intensity on susceptibility images, likely representing posterior fossa subdural hemorrhages.

There has been interval decrease in the numerous petechial hemorrhages involving the supra- and infratentorial regions.
Incidental note is again noted of a right insular developmental venous anomaly.
There are no foci of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction.

No new extra-axial collection is identified.
T1 hyperintense focus in the left cerebellum.

While it does appear to be markedly decreased compared to older prior studies, this may be related to differences in technique given that all the other prior imaging was performed at 3 Tesla compared to the current and most recent prior study which were both performed at 1.5 Tesla MRI.
Several areas of peribronchial infiltration and alveolitis due to infection have improved.
The wide variation in appearance suggests viral infection with a small airway component.
Moderate-to-severe emphysema, most pronounced in the right lung.
Persistent severe splenomegaly.
Bone marrow bx here showed complex acute myeloid leukemia.
Despite broad antibiotic coverage, her O2 requirement began to increase and micafungin was added empirically [**8-10**] for fungal coverage.
On [**8-11**] the patient had worsening hypoxia with O2 saturation 90% on 50% face mask.
ABG revealed respiratory alakalosis with concomittant metabolic alkalosis.
She underwent a repeat CT thorax that revealed worsening widespread ground glass opacities in the lungs bilaterally, with airspace opacities in the lung bases, right middle lobe, and lingula.
Due to lack of improvement in respiratory status, and also with plans to initiate chemotherapy for presumed component of infiltrative leukemia adding to worsening respiratory status, she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
On [**8-16**] she developed hypertension with bradycardia and suspicion for [**Location (un) 3484**] triad led to getting a head CT.  Pt underwent head CT [**2153-8-17**] which demonstrated L cerebellar lesion, initally concerning for infarct.
Of note she had a head CT on [**8-10**] which showed no acute intracranial process.
No source for thrombus seen on CTA head and neck.
TEE negative for vegetations.
MRI [**2153-8-23**] performed as follow up was concerning for mass or infection rather than infarct.
LP was performed to evaluate for infection and sent for cytology per Hem/Onc.
She reached the floor in stable condition and did not have any symptoms of infection including fever, chills, HA, vision changes, SOB, Chest pain, Cough, abdominal pain, diarhea, constipation, urinary symptoms.
ID was still following the patient and there was concern that her ring enhancing lesion was toxoplasmosis especially since the pt had a strong history of having toxo in the past and loosing a pregnancy from it.
She also had a repeat bone marrow biopsy on day +14 after her 7+3 induction chemotherapy, which showed 30% cellularity , or poor responce to the chemo.
It showed Stable size of the left cerebellar lesion with decrease in surrounding FLAIR signal abnormality, suggesting decrease in edema.
It also showed numerous low-intensity foci that likely reflects microbleeds.
The appearance of the lesion on repeat imaging was concerning for fungal infection.
On Day +12, she developed fever assocaited with erythema and redness of the tissue around her right eye.
On [**2153-9-12**], she underwent repeat bone marrow biopsy which showed hypercellular marrow (90%) packed with monocytes (leukemic cells) and blasts.
Although her cell counts were slow to recover, she improved significantly over the ensuing weeks, becoming afebrile and no longer requiring oxygen to breathe.
Febrile neutropenia - The patient developed fevers around [**9-10**] which occurred on and off for approximately 10 days.
There was no clear etiology for fevers - a pulmonary process (given infiltrates in both lungs) was felt to be most likely, but the fevers may also have been due to disseminated fungal infection (e.g.
related to the cerebellar lesion in the brain) or to primary AML disease (which may also have contributed to pulmonary infiltrates).
Her baseline EKG on [**2153-10-11**] showed a QT interval of 398, any increase >25% over baseline should be concerning for QT prolongation and these medications should be discontinued with resumption of other antibiotic coverage.
Further, the patient should have daily serum potassium and magnesium levels drawn, and these should be repleted immediately as needed to prevent any cardiac complications on these medications.
Pancytopenia: Mrs. [**Known lastname 83420**] remained afebrile from [**2153-9-21**] until the time of discharge, despite her neutropenia.
Left cerebellar lesion: Per radiology, this lesion was considered to unlikely be a bleed given stable appearance on MRI > 1 month.
Enhancement without substantial edema suggested possible fungal infection (vs. bacterial).
Less likely related to AML infiltrates.
Lung infiltrate: A new left upper lobe infiltrate was noted on a chest CT from [**2153-9-28**].
She remained afebrile and asymptomatic.
Repeat chest CT on [**2153-10-8**] showed interval improvement.

You were started on antibiotics to treat toxoplasmosis or fungal infection in case this was what you had.
