Admission Date:  [**2168-10-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2168-10-11**]   Service:  ACOVE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asbestos exposure and a positive smoking history who presents with increased shortness of breath, status post bronchoscopy one day prior to admission.
The patient has had a cough for about one year and has been intermittent, but with copious sputum production.
He has otherwise had no other systemic symptoms.
His primary care physician has placed on cyclic antibiotics over the past six months with Cipro with improvement in cough, but no change in the sputum.
The chest CT revealed a left hilar mass that was 3.2 by 2.3 cm causing depression of the bronchus to 2 mm in the transverse diameter as well as left upper lobe consolidations.
There was also diffuse lymphadenopathy.
He was found on the day of admission on the ground by his family and presented to the Emergency Department with fevers of 102, chills, diaphoresis and shortness of breath that was much worse then at baseline.
Likely bronchogenic CA as above.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Status post gastrointestinal bleed in [**2166**].
FAMILY HISTORY:  Notable for emphysema in his father.
In general he was an elderly man in moderate to severe respiratory distress with accessory muscle use.
His neck revealed no jugulovenous distention.
His lung examination was notable for coarse bilateral rhonchi on exhalation left greater then right with poor aeration throughout.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
His abdomen was soft, nontender, protuberant with no hepatosplenomegaly.
His extremities had no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Chest film was performed that showed worsening post obstructive collapse versus pneumonia around the left hilum that was found to be post obstructive.
Over the next two days the patient's respiratory status improved significantly and his oxygen requirement dropped notably.
While he was on the floor he was afebrile with a normal blood pressure throughout and he will need to finish a fourteen day course of Ceftazidime and Levofloxacin.
This was likely secondary to sepsis from the pneumonia.
Renal failure:  The patient likely had prerenal azotemia from his hypotension and hypovolemia.
His urine electrolytes were suggestive of prerenal azotemia.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and per his primary care physician who knows him well has persistently wheezed over the last several years.
Endocrine:  The patient had hyperglycemia while on the steroids.
He will then see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] on [**2168-10-20**] at 11:30 a.m. for further evaluation of his lung mass.
