It was not associated with any abdominal pain, fevers, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, or diarrhea.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction noted to be greater than 60%.
Benign prostatic hyperplasia.
Prostate cancer with known metastasis.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
General:  The patient was alert, cooperative, in no acute distress.
The nasogastric tube was showing reddish brown liquid draining.

No evidence of anterior or posterior lymph node adenopathy.

This endoscopy showed two submucosal bleedings; while there was evidence of recent bleeding, neither of them were actively bleeding at the time of the scope.
At this time, General Surgery was consulted for possible intervention should the patient have an exsanguinating event and for possible treatment plans.
General Surgery consult pointed out that the patient indeed had significant comorbidities which should be considered in designing a treatment plan.
These included insulin-dependent diabetes times eight years, congestive heart failure, hypertension, and a history of prostate cancer.
Most recent echocardiogram on [**2140-7-18**] revealed no valvular abnormalities, mild left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction of 55%.
Most importantly, the patient had 13 or 14 positive prostate biopsies for high-grade adenocarcinoma of the prostate in [**2137**].
A bone scan in [**2137**] revealed upper and lower thoracic activity and metastatic disease could not be excluded.
Given the likely metastatic stage of the disease the patient has in the past declined surgery and x-ray therapy for his prostate.
Surgery proceeded without any complications and the patient was extubated and moved to the Intensive Care Unit in relatively stable condition.
