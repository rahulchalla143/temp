Patient developed symptoms on the morning of admission, in the ED he was also endorsing rigors and feeling systemically ill.
Exam was notable for crackles at right base and 3+ pitting edema (stable per daughter).
Chest x-ray showed persistent left sided masses and resolving infiltrate in the right lower lobe.
During that admission, he was found to have a multifocal legionella pneumonia for which he was treated empirically with vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin.
Notably, he was transiently hypotensive with pressor requirement at the beginning of the hospital admission.
He is without chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, lightheadedness or dizziness.
Past Medical History: - Large cell lymphoma involving the base of the tongue, completed 6th cycle of Rituxan, Gemzar, and oxaliplatinum on [**11-10**] with limited results and PET showing increased activity in the lung and abdomen.
He then started R-CHOP in [**Month (only) 1096**] and finished a burst of prednisone on day prior to admission - Transitional cell carcinoma of bladder in [**2099**] - Atrial fibrillation on coumadin - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - Glaucoma - Paget's disease - Gout - Peripheral vascular disease - Degenerative joint disease - ECG with known LAFB, RBBB since [**9-14**] or prior   Social History: Lives with his wife and daughter in [**Location (un) 686**].
Extremities: 2+ pitting edema to mid shins bilateral; dry skin with scaling and hyperpigmentation distally  Focused Discharge Examination: General: patient comfortable, no distress.
Lungs: good air movement, clear bilaterally with trace rales at the bases.
Extremities: trace pitting edema bilaterally.

Persistent right basilar opacity, slightly improved though likely represents residual pneumonia versus scarring.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: In summary an 82-year-old man with history of large B-cell lymphoma s/p 6 cycles of Rituxan, Gemzar, and Oxaliplatinum and most recently R-CHOP, now presents with fevers and weakness, admitted to the intensive care unit for AF with RVR and neutropenia with fever.
The source of the infection was later felt to be a urinary tract infection.
# Atrial fibrillation: During his most recent admission, patient had been treated transiently with amiodorone and digoxin, although both of these medications were discontinued at time of discharge.
He continued to have AFIB with RVR, even on escalating doses of metoprolol.
This dose was decreased prior to discharge, given the patient's CKD and history of digoxin effects.
No sputum or blood cultures were positive.
The patient was afebrile for 24 hours by time of discharge.
# Hypoxia and oxygen requirement: Likely multifactorial, given concern of pneumonia as well as multiple masses in left lung.
Thought there might have been a pulmonary edema componenet, but the patient auto-diuresed as his rate was better controlled during his ICU stay.
The oxygen requirement and LE edema both resolved prior to discharge.
# Thombocytopenia/ anemia: Likely secondary to recent chemotherapy.
Had febrile reaction to transfusion on [**12-28**], where transfusion was stopped early.
Patient was asymptomatic otherwise.
No evidence of hemolysis or other causes of anemia.
# Lower extremity edema: 1+ pitting edema at baseline.
# Obstructive sleep apnea: During his previous admission, he refused CPAP.

Disp:*45 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Americare  Discharge Diagnosis: Neutropenic fever Urinary tract infection Atrial fibrillation with rapid rate Lymphoma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
As you know, you were admitted when you felt cold, and were found to have an infection and a rapid heart rate with your atrial fibrillation.
You were started on IV antibiotics for your infection in the ICU, which were later changed to pill antibiotics (cefpodoxime) to complete treatment for a urinary tract infection.
When you were first admitted, your blood counts were low, likely due to your recen chemotherapy.
He should see you to discuss followup of your urinary tract infection and heart rate (including the new medication digoxin and the need to continue taking it).
We have set up visiting nurse services to have your INR checked, but you should go to [**Hospital1 **] Monday if for some reason that does not occur.
