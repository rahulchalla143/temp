Past Oncologic History: Pt was originally diagnosed with prostate cancer and underwent a prostatectomy in [**2134**].
He had an EGD and colonoscopy which showed a large mass in the GE junction.
Biopsy showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet features.
Other Past Medical History: severe AS s/p valvuloplasty ([**Location (un) 109**] ranged from 0.8->1.6 per daughter) - Hypertension - multivessel CAD - radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer in [**2134**] -  Lymphedema of the left leg following prostatectomy - left inguinal hernia - hiatal hernia - renal calculi - COPD - hypertension - hyperlipidemia.

ASPERGILLUS FUMIGATUS.

Immunoflourescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) (Final       [**2151-6-24**]):    NEGATIVE for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii)..     FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2151-6-24**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO MYCOBACTERIA ISOLATED.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2151-6-26**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.. .
New atelectasis and inflammation probably due to aspiration left lower lobe.
Severe calcific aortic stenosis.
Multiple new predominantly peripherally located nodular opacities since [**2151-4-21**], with new small bilateral pleural effusions, favors an infectious process such as fungal infection or COP remains in the differential diagnosis.
Moderate airways disease as manifested by moderate bronchiectasis.
Area of asymmetric soft tissue involving the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta likely related to plaque though a component of inflammation from post-treatment is not entirely excluded.
Known esophageal cancer as manifested by circumferential esophageal wall thickening at the gastroesophageal junction.
Rare atypical cells in a background of degenerated bronchial   cells and macrophages.
Changing appearance of peripheral opacities favors cryptogenic organizing pneumonia over fungal infection or other infectious etiologies (such as septic emboli).
Bilateral pleural effusion and third spacing inclduing as mild ascites and pronounced scrotal edema are consitent with CHF.
Associated relaxation atelectasis.
Bilateral adrenal fat-[**Doctor First Name **] adenomas versus myelolipomas.
Right hepatic lobe indeterminate lesion may be a cyst or hemangioma.
Consider outpatient ultrasound followup.
Small hypodensity in the thyroid.
[**Known lastname 77811**] is an 88 year old man with esophageal cancer and aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty.
He presented to the ICU with respiratory failure.
A CXR was performed on [**6-16**] as part of a fever work-up and showed new atelectasis and inflammation probably due to aspiration in left lower lobe.
He had blood cultures and sputum cultures that were positive for Acinetobacter Baumannii.
On [**6-23**] he had a worsening of his respiratory status.
He continued to have fevers despite antibiotic treatment.
There was no evidence of an abscess.
He had large pleural effusions.
[**Known lastname 77811**] was grossly overloaded with evidence of edema in the upper and lower extremities.
His low albumin was thought to be contributing to some 3rd spacing due to a decrease in his oncotic pressures.
Esophageal cancer.
Malnutrition: Mr. [**Known lastname 77811**] had poor PO intake which was likely related to his esophageal mass which caused him some odynophagia.
Pulmonary Embolus: On review of the CTA from [**6-22**] radiology found a subsegmental PE (amended report).
Medications on Admission: Diltiazem SR 120mg daily Enalapril 10mg qAM Furosemide 40mg daily (was [**Hospital1 **]) Xeloda 2000mg [**Hospital1 **] Prilosec 20mg [**Hospital1 **] Colace PRN  Discharge Medications: none  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis Sepsis Pneumonia Esophageal Cancer Hypoxic Respiratory Failure Aortic Stenosis   Discharge Condition: Expired   Discharge Instructions: Expired  Followup Instructions: Expired
