Noted to be tachycardic with BP 88/60 and rigoring last night at [**Hospital1 26276**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for evaluation.
In the ED, patient was noted to be hypotensive to 105/42 with lactate of 6.5, acute on chronic renal failure and leukocytosis.
Chest x-ray was concerning for pneumonia.
CT A/P with contrast showed pelvic fluid collcetion with air and contrast from CT 2 days ago concerning for bowel leak - surgery consulted and do not feel suregery indicated given history of cancer and previous documentation of pelvic fluid collection.
Patient is very nervous and anxious, otherwise no complaints.
States that he has no pain, breathing comfortably, but is tired of being moved around from place to place.
Notes from [**Hospital1 1501**] detail left eye drifting , full body tremors and tan drainage from penis this week.
Also notations of having poor appetite and some nausea/vomiting 1 week prior.
ROS: The patient denies any fevers, abdominal pain, melena, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, cough, lightheadedness, focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.
Past Medical History: - History of rectal cancer s/p pelvic exenteration, cystectomy, formation of ileal conduit and colostomy; in remission - Enterocutaneous fistula s/p enterectomy, enteroenterostomy in [**3-/2188**] with urostomy and colostomy placement.
- Recent IR placed pigtail catheter for deep pelvic collections,  removed [**2194-12-1**] and patient declining any more pigtail placements - Clear cell RCC s/p partial right nephrectomy [**2-/2193**] - Chronic renal failure (baseline Cr 1.4-1.6) - COPD - Atrial flutter s/p DCCV - Hypertension - Asthma - Depression - H/o C. diff colitis - Bicuspid AV with AS and AI  Social History: Lives at [**Location (un) 169**] [**Hospital1 1501**] with no family support.
Divorced with no children.
Family History: Brother with renal cancer died in his 60s, brother with lung cancer died in his 60s.
Family history of heart disease.
Physical Exam: On Admission: Vitals: T: BP: 134/93 HR: 136 RR: 20 O2Sat: 97%RA GEN: Elderly, anxious, tremulous HEENT: Dry mucous membranes, sclera anicteric, no epistaxis or rhinorrhea, no dentition, OP appears clear, tongue dry.
NECK: No JVD, Left IJ in place, no bruits, no cervical lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: tachycardic, irregular, trace systolic murmur at aortic position.
radial pulses +2 PULM: Lungs CTAB anteriorly, no wheeze or rhonchi appreciated ABD: Soft, NT, ND, +BS, urostomy with health pink tissue and clear yellow urine, ostomy bag with light brown liquid stool and healthy pink tissue at ostmy.
EXT: No C/C/E, no palpable cords, distal pulses 2+.
Pain to palpation over left forarm and elbow - movement limited by pain; no appreciable swelling, + echymosies.
otherwise CN II-XII appear intact, no facial droop.
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
no petechiae.
GU: uncircumcised male genitalia with no rash or appreciable discharge.
Findings consistent with acute tubular necrosis/renal dysfunction with retained IV contrast from exam two days prior.
Dense filling defects in a prominent CBD with mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation, unchanged.
New left lung base atelectasis and consolidation which may reflect superimposed pneumonia.
Sepsis / Pelvic fluid collection.
Treated with broad spectrum antibiotics (IV vancomycin and meropenem) given a history of ESBL E. Coli in pelvic abscess and oral metronidazole; 2 week course is planned with final day [**2195-2-6**].
There were no complications and drained feculent material which was cultured and grew mixed flora.
CT abdomen showed that the left posterior drainage pigtail catheter was withdrawn such that the tip was in the posterior gluteus/subcutaneous tissues.
On [**1-24**], patient became progressively confused and was severely agitated requiring restraints, speech became unintelligible and he had severe whole body tremors with evidence of mild tetany.
He also had abnormal eye movements which where darting from randomly without evidence of nystagmus or restriction in eye movement.
On reviewing his severe metabolic derangements, he was found to have severe hypomagnesemia (0.3) and hypocalcemia (4.8) which were the likely cause of confusion (metabolic encephalopathy), tremors and eye signs.
Aflutter/AF: On presentation he was noted to be tachycardic in Aflutter with variable block but given concomitant agitation and severe metabolic derangement he was initially treated with IV metoprolol and was fluid resuscitated.
Due to borderline BPs and after intubation on [**1-24**] he was supported with IV pressors.
Given persistent tachycardia to 140s, his norepinephrine was changed to phenylephrine and was treated with IV diltiazem and latterly a diltiazem infusion.
Metabolic acidosis: The patient presented with a combined elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis and a non AG metabolic acidosis and of note, he had his metabolic acidosis on previous admissions.
Acidosis was felt likely multifactorial in the setting of renal failure, increasing urostomy output and sepsis secondary to his chronic pelvic collection.
Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Baseline of chronic renal failure with a creatinine 1.4-1.6.
FeNa: 1.7% was suggestive of ATN and he was aggressively fluid resuscitated.
Respiratory failure: On presentation, there was the possibility of LLL pneumonia on portable CXR [**1-24**] based on radiology read with possible atelectasis vs consolidation in retrocardiac region.
Left arm pain: Left upper extremity was negative for fracture, dislocation or osteolytic lesions on XR and UENI negative for DVT.
This was monitored and managed symptomatically with acetaminophen prn for pain and his pain improved.
Per review patient is in remission from dual malignancies (colon cancer + clear cell carcinoma).
SW talked to legal, they are looking for anything short of guardianship which will likely be the only option.
