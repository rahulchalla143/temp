In this patient with known pseudoaneurysm of the gastroduodenal artery, status post coiling, there is no evidence of revascularization or active leak from the aneurysm.
Mild interval decrease in the size of the thrombosed aneurysm.
The evaluation is slightly limited due to streak artifact from the coil pack.
Simple left renal cortical cysts and concerning lesion in the right kidney at midpole.
This may represent a complex cyst, however enhancement is concerning for papillary renal cell carcinoma, further evaluation with MRI is recommended.
Bilateral small pleural effusions.
Mild splenomegaly.
Right wrist X-ray: IMPRESSION: No fracture or dislocation.
Chest X-ray on admission: IMPRESSION: Small left pleural effusion but no acute cardiopulmonary process otherwise identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 year old male with localized pancreatic cancer diagnosed in [**2141**] s/p 3 cycles gemcitabine and cyberknife therapy, as well as past ERCP with CBD stenting in [**2142**] and re-stenting in [**3-/2144**], diabetes mellitus, recently discharged on [**3-31**] after IR embolization of pancreatic pseudoaneurysm who presents with melena.
ACTIVE ISSUES ------------- # Gastrointestinal bleed: patient had four episodes of melanotic stool at home with guaiac positive stool on exam.
Hematocrit was stable without transfusions.
CTA of the abdomen had no evidence of extravasation through coiled pseudoaneurysm.
No hematemesis and benign abdominal exam were noted, and stable hematocrits and negative NG lavage suggested that upper GI source was less likely, though small shallow ulcerations were seen in the duodenum on ERCP in 5/[**2143**].
Patient does have diverticulosis seen on CT in [**2141**] with prior remote episodes of melenic stool.
Source of bleed seems to most likely be lower gastrointestinal and differential diagnosis included diverticular, AV malformation, or less likely internal hemorrhoids or colon cancer.
He does have a documented history of colon cancer s/p resection in [**2137**].
GI did a bedside endoscopy, showing shallow non-bleeding ulcer, but no active bleeding.
Patient did have a few bloody stools during his admission, for which no intervention was undertaken.
Patient was initially put on a pantoprazole drip on admission which was later switched to IV pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **] and then PO pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **] for discharge.
He will get a CBC soon after discharge to assure no active bleeding.
# Right wrist pain: Pt complained of right wrist pain s/p mechanical fall 4 days prior to admission with no evidence of fracture or dislocation on X-ray and low suspicion for a septic joint.
Pain was controlled with oxycodone, which he will continue as an outpatient.
INACTIVE ISSUES --------------- # Pancreatic pseudoaneurysm: on last admission in [**3-/2144**] patient was found to have a 1.9 mm pseudoaneurysm in the pancreas.
It was suspected to be due to his pancreatic cancer vs radiation treatments.
He underwent successful embolization in [**3-/2144**] and CTA abdomen on this admission demonstrated thrombosed aneurysm decreased in size from last imaging, with no signs of extravasation or leaking.
# Biliary obstruction: CBD stent has been placed in [**2141**] with recent admission in [**3-/2144**] for abdominal pain and worsening obstructive jaundice, found to have mobilized stent in CBD which was replaced.
No abdominal pain was present during hospitalization and his liver function tests were improved from last admission and remained stable, so restenosis is unlikely.
Patient follows at [**Hospital **] Hospital with no treatments in past year though with complications of pseudoaneurysm and CBD obstruction likely due to recurrence of active disease, as seen on most recent PET scan.
There was no evidence of extravasation within his pseudoaneurysm.
On CT in [**3-/2144**], there was evidence of increasing peripancreatic, gastrohepatic and periportal lymphadenopathy, likely representing metastatic disease from pancreatic cancer.
# Kidney mass: upon getting a CTA of the abdomen, it was noted that there was a mass in the right kidney, for which radiology reported that a carcinoma could not be ruled out.
There were no documented fevers since admission, no leukocytosis, and no localized signs/symptoms of infection though patient had intermittent diarrhea for past few weeks with possible evidence of colitis on CT few weeks ago.
There was no suggestion of cholecystitis, diverticulitis, pneumonia or genitourinary infection.
# Diabetes mellitus type 2: patient is on levemir 6 units [**Hospital1 **] at home.
# Gout: no evidence of gouty flare in wrist joint.
# Hypertension: Home lasix and lisinopril were initially held on admission given GI bleed and that he was normotensive.
An MRI of the abdomen is also needed to further classify the mass noted in the patient's right kidney.
Imodium A-D  Oral 7. loperamide 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO four times a day as needed for diarrhea.
Outpatient Lab Work Please perform CBC on [**2144-4-23**]   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Gastrointestianal bleed Right wrist sprain  Secondary: Pancreatic cancer Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Your bleeding may be due to aberrant vessels in your pancreatic tumor.
Your coumadin was also stopped because it is a blood thinner and can increase the risk of bleeding.
It would also likely be worthwhile for you to get a colonoscopy due to your gastrointestinal bleeding that you came to the hospital for.
While you were in the hospital you also experienced some pain in your right wrist which you had fallen on.
There was a mass noted on your kidney that was found on a CT scan that was performed during your admission.
papillary renal cell carcinoma
