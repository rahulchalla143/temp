Admission Date:  [**2100-7-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2100-7-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2048-1-28**]     Sex:  F  Service:  Medicine, [**Hospital1 **] Firm  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal distention.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and alcohol dependence who presents with approximately a 3-month history of increasing abdominal girth which has been acutely worsening in the last three weeks with dyspnea and lower extremity edema.
The patient had associated mild pain in the periumbilical region with possible chills, nausea, and vomiting secondary to abdominal fullness.
No history of intravenous drug use, tattoos, hepatitis, or unsafe intercourse.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, anxious but in no acute distress.
A distended abdomen.
Periumbilical tenderness in the right and left lower quadrant.
Genitourinary examination revealed no costovertebral angle tenderness.
Musculoskeletal examination revealed no aches.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING FINDINGS:   Abdominal ultrasound echocardiogram revealed ascites plus gallbladder wall thickening; consistent with ascites.
The liver had an increased echogenic texture.
No intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
A computed tomography of the abdomen showed "heterogenously decreased attenuation of the liver with reflux of contrast material into the hepatic veins with associated large amount of ascites.
Fatty replacement/tumor infiltration/other chronic liver disease are differential possibilities.
Congestive hepatopathy was thought less likely."
ASCITES ISSUES:  In the Emergency Department, at the time of presentation on [**2100-7-14**], a paracentesis of one liter was done with Gram stain and culture negative for organisms, white blood cell count was 210 (with 7 polys) and consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
[**Last Name (un) 26460**] discriminant factor was less than 32; so treatment was not started for possible alcoholic hepatitis given AST of 159 and ALT of 19; which is greater than a 2:1 ratio.
A transjugular liver biopsy with Hepatology consultation was done in the Intensive Care Unit on [**2100-7-15**] which found changes consistent with toxic metabolic injury plus fibrosis of the portal and sinusoidal portions.
A regimen of Lasix 80 mg, spironolactone 200 mg by mouth once per day, and pentoxifylline 400 mg three times per day resulted in fluid loss and decreased body weight.
The patient also denied any new onset of shortness of breath.
The differential possibilities included possible cholangitis; alkaline phosphatase was 998 and GGT was 1003.
Possibility number two was possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
All paracentesis done on [**2014-7-14**], and 20 were negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis with a white count of 210, 173, and 46; respectively.
However, concern over a possible gastrointestinal bleed made prophylaxis against spontaneous bacterial peritonitis with levofloxacin 500 mg a necessity.
No signs on review of systems or examination.
ALCOHOL ABUSE WITHDRAWAL CONSIDERATION ISSUES:  The patient showed no signs of delirium tremens.
On [**2100-7-15**] the patient had a hematocrit drop of 25.5 to 14.1 and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for workup of possible variceal bleed.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy performed in the Intensive Care Unit were negative for gastrointestinal bleed, and no source of bleeding was identified.
