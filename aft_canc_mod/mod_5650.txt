She has been sufferring from frequent diarrhea and poor PO intake over the past few weeks and was recently admitted here from [**Date range (1) 96183**] for workup which was significant for negative stool and blood cultures as well as CT abdomen without evidence of crohns flair but findings suspicious for pancreatic cancer.
This morning, she felt light-headed and had a pre-syncopal event but never lost conciousness.
Following this event, she stood up and felt acutely nauseated and vomited NBNB emesis x 1.
Following emesis she developed acute onset substernal chest discomfort prompting visit to the ED.
On arrival to the ED, she was chestpain free but then had a short bout of chest pain that spontaneously resolved without treatment.
Cards was consulted in the ED and saw the patient, felt her story was concerning for NSTEMI, and performed bedside ECHO which demonstrated septal and anterior wall hypokinesis which was a change from prior ECHO from 11 years ago.
Additionally, she denies orthopnea, new DOE, PND, any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, or hemoptysis.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.

[**12-12**] ANKLE XRAY LEFT Significant soft tissue swelling about the ankle.
Atherosclerotic vascular calcifications.
No definite ankle effusion.
An ossific fragment is seen dorsal to the talar head, consistent with capsular avulsion fracture.
No other fractures identified.
No dislocation.
The mortise and syndesmosis are intact.
IMPRESSION: Talar head avulsion fracture as above.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the distal septum and anterior wall.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**1-16**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild regional systolic dysfunction.
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation .
LABS ON DISCHARGE:  [**2146-12-19**] 07:10AM BLOOD WBC-11.8* RBC-2.90* Hgb-8.9* Hct-26.2* MCV-90 MCH-30.6 MCHC-33.9 RDW-14.4 Plt Ct-420 [**2146-12-19**] 07:10AM BLOOD Glucose-107* UreaN-29* Creat-1.4* Na-136 K-4.8 Cl-104 HCO3-23 AnGap-14 [**2146-12-19**] 07:10AM BLOOD Calcium-9.0 Phos-3.7 Mg-2.0  Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]F with hx of HTN, HLD, Crohn's Disease on low dose prednisone, and recurrent Cdiff on vancomycin suppression here for syncopal episode this AM followed by chest pain concerning for NSTEMI, opting for medical management.
# CAD:  Patient presents with chest pain and concerning EKG for ischemia.
She has no known history of CAD and blood pressure and hyperlipidemia are controlled.
CT abd/pelvis from [**12-5**] does not show any signs of acute Crohn's flare.
There was concern that diarrhea was secondary to C.diff so her PO vancomycin dose was increased to daily dosing with minimal improvement in her diarrhea.
GI consult was obtained and they recommended cipro 500mg [**Hospital1 **] for active Crohn's flare and will continue it daily.
They recommended immodium, as she likely has diarrhea from Crohn's, not c.diff, and  increasing steroids.
On exam, she has bilateral rales and slightly elevated JVP consistent with fluid overload however history is consistent with a hypovolemic picture (diarrhea, dry mouth, poor PO intake and low urine output in addition to relative hypotension).
[**Name2 (NI) **] echo showed LVEF of 50% and mild-moderate aortic regurgitation; hypokinesis of distal septum and anterior wall.
An xray revealed a talar fracture.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # HTN:  The patient was initially relatively hypotensive at presentation but became hypertensive with holding of her medications.
Started high dose atorvastatin in the setting of concern for MI .
#  Pneumonia- CXR concerning for right lobe infiltrate.
Patient has no respiratory symptoms (no cough, shortness of breath, etc) but has elevated WBC and borderline temperature (99.7).
She received ceftriaxone and azithromycin in the ED for possible PNA, but this was discontinued as the final read of the CXR was consistent with atelectasis.
