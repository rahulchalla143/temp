Of note, there was confusion as to his code status, per the nursing home he was made full code today but their records note DNR/DNI and CMO prior to this change.
His physical exam was notable for diffuse wheezes, and he was coughing.
There was concern for PE given tachypnea, but his creatinine was elevated so he was not a candidate for CTPA.
The decision was made to attempt a CT head to assess for metastatic cancer prior to empirically starting heparin, but the patient became acutely agitated.

Low lung volumes.
Moderate cardiomegaly and signs of atelectasis at both lung bases.
No evidence of pneumonia or other acute lung changes.
The presence of a minimal right pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
There are no other dilated loops of bowel.
There are no abnormal air-fluid levels.
This is compatible with a nonspecific bowel gas pattern.
There is no pneumoperitoneum or pneumatosis.
IMPRESSION: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern without evidence of obstruction.

Brief Hospital Course: 78 y/o male with a history of psychiatric disorder NOS with catatonia, HCC, HCV/cirrhosis, and prostate cancer who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress  # Tachypnea: The patient was admitted to the MICU with tachypnea.
Initally thought to be secondary to acute agitation vs aspiration.
Infection was unlikley given lack of findings on CXR, the patient was afebrile, with no evidence of leukocytosis.
The patient had another episode of tachypnea on [**10-20**] with RR to 50s, in the setting of eating several mintues prior.
Othe vital signs were stable, not tachycardic or hypotensive, satting 99-100% on RA.
The cause of acute onset tachypnea was again unclear, thought to be related to aspiration event.
The tachypnea again resolved without intervention.
Patient appears to be tachypneic at baseline with RR 20s-30s, satting well on room air.
If becomes tachypneic at rehab, satting well at room air, would try low dose ativan 0.25mg IV or lose dose morphine 1-2mg IV to decrease respiratory rate.
# EKG Changes: Unclear the chronicity of these findings, but ST segment findings noted in precordial leads.
It is not possible to determine if the patient is having or had chest pain.
The patient had elevated troponins, but without any progressive elevation.
On [**10-20**] he had an episode of tachypnea in the setting of eating 5min prior.
there was concern for aspiration, although a CXR showed no evidence of aspirate in the lungs.
He was re-evaluated by speech and swallow therapy with a video oropharyngeal swallow study with no evidence of gross aspiration.
Small pills whole with applesauce, large pills crushed.
1:1 supervision with POs to assist with meal set up and feeding.
The patient was maintained on aspiration precautions during his hospital course, and these precautions should be continued on discharge  # Psychiatric disorder NOS: On admission the patient was intermittently agitated and catatonic.
Acute agitation responded well to ativan in the ED.
During this hospital the patient became more engaging and responded appropriately to questions, without evidence of catonia.
# HCC/HCV/Cirrhosis/Ascites:  The patient was diagnosed with a 3.8 cm ruptured HCC with subsequent massive hemoperitoneum s/p resection ([**11/2175**])  and likely recurrence of HCC as evidenced on right upper quadrant ultrasound.
His HCP/guardian wanted to pursue further diagnostic work up of recurrent mass seen on ultrasound to help with prognosis and  planning of relocating the patient to be closer to the guardian in [**Name (NI) 108**] or sending the patient back to his home country of [**Country 7018**].
Repeat ultrasound during this admission notable for interval increase in a right posterior lobe mass likely representing HCC.
Hepatology was consulted and concluded that recent U/S and clinical evaluation were consistent with likley multifocal HCC.
Diagnostic testing to confirm this would not be helpful given this would not impact therapy and biopsy could precipitate fatal hemorrhage or rupture.
He was conservatively managed with lactulose to prevent hepatic encephalopathy and spironalactone and lasix for diuresis.
During his hospital course the patient had 1 episode of abdominal pain with concern for Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis in the setting of his progressive ascites.
Cytology was also negative for malignant cells The patient also under went a therapeutic paracentesis by Interventional radiology, and had 3 L removed, without complication.
Lorazepam 0.25 mg IV HS:PRN agitation   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 1036**] - [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: hepatocellular carcinoma Cirrhosis Enterococcus UTI   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You third bedside swallow evaluation and video swallow study showed no evidence of gross aspiration.
With regard to your liver cancer and cirrhosis, you were seen by our liver doctors.
You had a repeat ultrasound which shows likely recurrence of your liver cancer.
You had fluid removed from your abdomen ( paracentesis), and the fluid studies showed no evidence of infection.
