History of Present Illness: The patient is a 77 year old female with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and moderate-severe aortic valve stenosis who was recently diagnosed in [**2174-1-6**] with a soft-tissue sarcoma in her right groin after developing right groin pain.
Soft tissue right thigh sarcoma - identified [**1-7**] right groin pain [**2174-1-6**]  - s/p gamma knife  - admitted this admission for wide excisional therapy #.
Aortic Stenosis  - moderate to severe aortic stenosis, [**Location (un) 109**] 0.8cm2; peak 64mmHg, mean 39mmHg) with mild aortic regurgitation  - echocardiogram at OSH revealed mild concentric LVH with normal biventricular function  - moderate tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension (46mmHg #.
Hypertension #.
Hyperlipidemia #.
Chronic backpain spinal stenosis   Social History: The patient is married (first husband died at age 28 [**1-7**] Hodgkin's lymphoma).
Right Lower Extremity: Incision site clean/dry/intact with some swelling over incision site.
[**4-19**]: HCT: 28.9, WBC: 5.6 PLT: 359  Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the vascular surgery service on [**2174-4-4**] for pre-operative planning.
In anticipation of the surgery, the patient underwent diagnostic abdominal aortogram with pelvic arteriogram with pre and post hydration with discontinuation of patient's home lasix.
The following morning, on the day of planned surgical resection, the patient was noted to be tachypnic, hypertensive, hypoxic and agitated with rales [**12-7**] way up her lung fields, consistent with pulmonary edema.
The surgery was cancelled given decompensated CHF requiring a non-rebreather.
The patient was then transferred to the medical service for management of CHF and medical optimization prior to possible repeat attempt for surgery.
She was optimized medically for one week and on [**4-13**], she underwent resection of her right groin sarcoma without complications.
Plastic surgery applied a gracilis flap over the femoral vessels.
It was also decided by them to keep her on oral keflex to prevent infection while the drain is in place.
