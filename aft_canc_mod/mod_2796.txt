Admission Date:  [**2161-10-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2161-11-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2088-12-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Dristan Cold  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3276**] Chief Complaint: Hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy [**2161-10-29**] Percutaneous GJ tube placement [**2161-11-5**] Radiation therapy [**Date range (3) 59717**]   History of Present Illness: 72yo woman with h/o newly diagnosed metastatic cancer (lung vs esophageal primary) with mass compressing the esophagus and left hip met presented [**2161-10-28**] with hemoptysis, melana, tachycardia.
Cancer diagnosed 3 weeks prior after patient noted progressive dysphagia.
Pt seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] as outpatient who felt patient was not an operative candidate for curative resection.
Three days prior to presentation the patient noted onset of a nonproductive cough without fevers, chills, chest pain.
On the morning of admission at 1AM, she awoke with cough productive of bloody sputum.
Later that morning she passed a large loose black stool x 2.
She has had poor po intake for the past week secondary to mass limited her ability tolerate solid food.
When she presented earlier today to [**Hospital **] clinic, she complained of dizziness/lightheadedness and was found to be tachycardic and orthostatic, and was referred to the ED for further evaluation.
She developed a transfusion reaction with fever.
GI service was consulted and reported that endoscopy would put the patient at further risk for bleeding due friable esophagus secondary to XRT, and limited therapeutic benefit in face of bleed due to tumor or radiation.
Thoracic surgery consulted and recommended palliative esophageal stenting after acute bleed resolved, but not acute surgical management of tumor burden.
no cervical/ supraclavicular LAD CV: tachycardic, regular.
some mild tenderness over lower right anterolateral ribs, mostly over intercostal muscles Lungs: decreased BS lower [**11-21**] R lung.
no palpable HSM.
no palpable cord.
no edema Back: nontender.
no visible rashes.
no focal motor or sensory deficits noted.
Labs:   Pertinent Results: Endoscopic Ultrasound ([**2161-10-7**]): A 35 x 41 mm heterogeneous mass with irregular borders was identified at 28 cm on the oposite site from the aorta in the mediastinum.
No adenopathy was noted.
FNA x 3 with a linear endoscope was performed--> cytology consistent with non-small cell carcinoma.
Chest x-ray([**2161-10-28**]): Extensive consolidation in right middle and right lower lobes and to a lesser degree in the right upper lobe and posterior segment of left lower lobe.
These findings may be due to massive aspiration, infectious pneumonia, or pulmonary hemorrhage.
A more chronic process such as bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma cannot be excluded.
CT([**2161-10-28**]): 1) Hyperenhancing focus superior to the esophageal mass which abuts the carina, right main stem bronchus and esophagus which could reflect hemorrhage.
2) Large lower esophageal mass displacing the left atrium.
3) Mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy.
4) Extensive alveolar opacities most pronounced in the right lower lobe which could reflect aspiration or hemorrhage.
5) Unremarkable aortic bypass graft with no evidence of aortoenteric fistula.
Brief Hospital Course: 72yo woman with newly diagnosed metastatic nonsmall cell cancer (esophageal vs lung primary) presenting with hemoptysis, melana, tachycardia.
Hemoptysis:  The patient initially presented with hemoptysis and the DDx included esophageal tumor invading trachea or bronchi, lung cancer, pneumonia vs. aspiration from UGIB.
Her CT scan on admission was concerning for a hemorrhagic lesion, and CXR for an aspiration event.
Treatment options were limited per thoracic surgery.
The patient suffered a tranfusion reaction consisting of tachycardia, tachypnea, and decreased oxygen saturation that resolved with benadryl and tylenol.
She underwent bronchoscopy on the second day of admission which showed extrinsic compression of bronchi, blood in the RLL c/w aspiration.
Melena:  Patient presented with apparent UGIB by history, but was guiaic negative on exam.
GI was consulted and initially deferred endscopy unless emergent given risk of bleeding with friability of gastroesophageal mucosa secondary to XRT and limited therapeutic options.
The DDx included esophageal tumor, mucositis secondary to XRT, PUD, esophagitis, [**Doctor First Name 329**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear.
Squamous Cell Cancer of Unknown Primary Source (lung vs esophageal): The patient's palliative treatment regimen consisted of XRT and weekly chemo on admission.
Coagulopathy, INR 1.5 on admit:  Coagulopathy was thought to be nutrional given the patient's poor po intake.
Tranfusion of FFP was attempted but failed due to tranfusion reaction.
Tachycardia:  The patient presented with tachycardia that was felt to be due acute blood loss causing hypovolemia.
Echocardiogram showed normal LV function and no pericardial spread of disease causing pericardial effusion.
It was then felt that her tachycardia may be associated with the low grade fevers she experienced and anxiety.
On the third night of admission, she developed acute pulmonary edema secondary to 4-5 Liters IVF boluses for treatment of tachycardia.
She was subsequently diuresed approximately 3 liters and her oxygenation and tachypnea improved by later that day.
ARF:  Creatitine on admission was 1.1 from baseline 0.6, and was thought to be prerenal associated with her acute blood loss.
HTN:  Patient has a history of HTN treated with HCTZ.
In the ICU, the patient has continued to be normotensive to mildly hypertensive with SBP 140-150s during her hospitalization.
- Monitor blood pressure.
Today [**4-27**] of antibiotics (levofloxacin/clindamycin) for possible aspiration pneumonia.
She continues to have occasional low grade fevers.
CXR today not sig changed from yesterday  - continue to monitor respiratory rate, fever and wbc count.
CHF: pulm edema likely related to IVF boluses, improving with diuresis.
- once pt stabilized, will discuss with thoracic surgery the possibility of palliative esophageal stent.
Pain:  continue to manage pain with fentanyl patch and morphine iv for breakthrough  11.
We will continue to address code status given prognosis is poor.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.

Discharge Instructions: Call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] if you have a fever > 101.4, lightheadedness, dizziness, trouble breathing or blood in your stool or black stool.
