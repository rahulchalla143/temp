Admission Date:  [**2186-9-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2186-10-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2133-2-21**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Metastatic thyroid cancer to the lungs.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and a long history of multinodular goiter, which has doubled in size recently.
The patient was admitted on [**8-/2186**] and found to have D-differential papillary carcinoma on fine-needle aspiration.
The patient was also found to have multiple pulmonary nodules on chest CT and chest x-ray at that time, and the patient was admitted on [**2186-9-13**] with shortness of breath and aspirate of right lower lobe nodule at that time revealed malignant cells.
The patient had a CAT scan at that time, which revealed multiple pulmonary nodules.
The patient presented with progressive shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, right sided chest discomfort.
Postoperatively, the patient had increased hypoxia.
The patient was found to have small PEs on CT angiogram.
The patient was started on decadron prechemotherapy and the course was complicated by possible pneumonia on chest x-ray.
There was no complaints of chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or pleuritic chest pain that the patient recalls.
Thyroid cancer, tissue biopsy awaiting diagnosis with pulmonary metastasis, diagnosed by FMA as D-differentiated papillary carcinoma versus medullary carcinoma.
Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus on oral hypoglycemics.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
GENERAL:  The patient is a fairly ill-appearing female in no apparent distress.
CARDIAC:  Normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
STUDIES:  CT angiogram revealed multiple small segmental PEs.
CT of the body revealed increased side of pulmonary nodules, large heterogenous goiter.
While the patient was on the Oncology Service at [**Hospital1 190**], the pulmonary status remained tenuous initially, requiring q.4h.
nebs, Albuterol and Atrovent MDIs and Flovent MDIs, as well as aggressive chest PT.
The patient was also placed Levaquin and Flagyl due to possible pneumonia given low-grade temperatures, increased white blood cell count and a chest x-ray, which was equivocable for lower lobe atelectasis versus pneumonia.
There was no evidence of volume overload, and the patient was not diuresed for reasons of CHF.
The patient tolerated this regimen fairly well, even though she had subsequent decrease in the hematocrit possibly due to this chemotherapy.
The patient complained of no pleuritic chest pain.
The patient had guaiac time three negative and hemolysis labs, which were negative, but the hematocrit continued to drift downwards and eventually had to be transfused two units of packed red blood cells.
The patient's PT remained high around 1.8 during the admission, which was thought to be due to poor nutritional status and after her nutrition picked up the INR drifted downwards to 1.1.
The patient also had hyponatremia, thought to be due to SIADH secondary to pulmonary metastasis, which improved gradually with the administration of salt tablets and Lasix, which were given as a standing dose.
The patient had no neurological manifestations of hyponatremia, such as decreased mental status or confusion.
The patient consistently stated that she does not want heroic measures to be taken and, therefore, change in code status was consistent with this long-held view.
Metastatic thyroid carcinoma with metastasis to lung.
Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone secondary to pulmonary metastasis.
Recent PE during this admission secondary to hypercoagulable state.
Anemia secondary to chemotherapeutic agents.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
The patient was to be discharged to [**Hospital3 7**] for further management of her pulmonary complications secondary to pulmonary metastasis.
