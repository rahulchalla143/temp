A head CT was obtained which showed a large 2-cm intercellular mass consistent with a pituitary macroadenoma.
A chest x-ray showed no acute abnormalities.
The patient was hydrated and given stress-dose steroids with hydrocortisone given pituitary macroadenoma seen on head CT.  Of note, the patient did not require any sedation while intubated.
The patient subsequently sent out coffee-grounds emesis from a nasogastric tube with maroon-colored stools.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed which revealed mild distal esophagitis as well as a moderate-sized hiatal hernia.
In the first portion of duodenum there was noted to be a large ulcer with a clean white base with no stigmata of recent bleeding.
Given the large pituitary macroadenoma seen on head CT and hypothermia and hypotension on presentation, a workup for panhypopituitarism was initiated.
Given low-normal free T4 and total T3 and relative hypotension the patient was started on intravenous levothyroxine and hydrocortisone.
Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 5-cm X 2-cm X 2.5-cm enhancing lobulated soft tissue mass originating in the sella turcica and extending superiorly into the supracellular cistern; most likely representing a pituitary macroadenoma.
There was no evidence of hemorrhage or infarct on diffusion-weighted images.
A CT of the chest with CT spiral angiography was obtained which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
There were small bilateral lobe airspace infiltrates; otherwise, lung parenchyma was clear.
Given liver function abnormalities on presentation, and abdominal CT was done which showed evidence of cirrhosis with a small amount of ascites.
Given liver abnormalities and hypoxia, a concern for hepatopulmonary syndrome was considered.
The patient's brother reports the patient appeared jaundiced and had progressive fatigue and decreased energy levels.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
He has never been married with no children.
Mucous membranes were dry with crusted blood in his mouth.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Lungs revealed crackles at the bases, right greater than left.
Abdomen was soft and nontender.
Positive distention with fluid wave.
Antinuclear antibody positive.
Human immunodeficiency virus negative.
MICROBIOLOGY: (a)  Urine on admission with no white blood cells.
(b)  Blood cultures 1/4 bottles from [**2128-10-30**] drawn from subclavian central line were positive for Staphylococcus aureus coagulase-positive oxacillin resistant.
(c)  Peritoneal fluid on [**2128-11-1**] revealed no growth.
(d)  Pleural fluid from [**11-4**] revealed no growth.
(f)  Blood cultures for fungal and acid-fast bacillus with no fungus or macrobacteria isolated.
A portable chest x-ray on [**2128-10-29**] revealed low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right.
A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis on [**2128-10-31**] showed a large amount of abdominal pelvic ascites as well as significant soft tissue edema, bilateral pleural effusions.
The liver was small without focal masses.
A chest CT on [**2128-10-31**] with contrast revealed no enlarged lymph nodes and small pleural effusions (left greater than right).
No focal lung consolidations, pneumothorax, or nodule.
A review of the chest CT obtained at the outside hospital revealed small bilateral pleural effusions with otherwise clear lung parenchyma.
No evidence of pneumonia.
In addition, a CT angiogram obtained at the outside hospital showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Given cirrhosis seen on abdominal CT, concern for hepatopulmonary syndrome was addressed.
A echocardiogram with bubble study was obtained which indicated a marked right-to-left shunt strongly suggestive of pulmonary arterial venous shunting.
A CT of the chest with contrast was repeated; and on review with Radiology, there was no large pulmonary arteriovenous malformation which would be amenable to embolization.
The etiology of hypoxia was again thought to be secondary to hepatopulmonary syndrome.
Fluid culture showed no growth.
The etiology of fluid was thought to be from massive ascites.
The patient was evaluated by the Liver Service for a possible liver transplant, but was not a candidate secondary to profound hypoxia.
Therefore, treatment for hepatopulmonary syndrome remained supportive with supplemental oxygen.
A CT scan done on admission at the outside hospital showed a large pituitary macroadenoma.
A follow-up magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography did not show any evidence of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.
The patient underwent electroencephalogram which showed slow background maximum frequency 6 hertz versus delta frequency consistent with encephalopathy.
The etiology of suppressed mental status was thought to be secondary to structural lesion (pituitary mass versus toxic metabolic state), hepatopulmonary syndrome.
ENDOCRINE SYSTEM:  The patient presented with known pituitary macroadenoma with suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, LH, and normal cortisol.
Given the relative hypoxia and poor medical condition, the patient was unstable to go to the operating room for surgical resection of the pituitary mass.
Given the use of subcutaneous heparin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis at the outside hospital a hemagglutination-inhibition test antibody was sent and was positive.
It was unclear if coagulation abnormalities were secondary to liver disease versus disseminated intravascular coagulation.
The etiology of disseminated intravascular coagulation included sepsis.
Blood cultures drawn on admission grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in [**12-26**] bottles.
The patient continued to have low platelets, elevated INR, and low fibrinogen which was thought to be likely secondary to progressive liver disease.
GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM:  The patient presented with evidence of cirrhosis with an elevated INR, large ascites, an albumin of 2.1, and a bilirubin of 1.2.
In addition, an antinuclear antibody and anti-smooth muscle antibody returned positive; consistent with possible autoimmune hepatitis.
The patient underwent a diagnostic paracentesis to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in the setting of disseminated intravascular coagulation of unknown etiology.
This revealed 10 white blood cells with [**Pager number 45264**] red blood cells; and the culture showed no growth.
In addition, the Liver Service evaluated the patient for a possible liver transplant; but given pronoun hypoxia, the patient was not a candidate.
At the outside hospital the patient had an upper gastrointestinal bleed with coffee-grounds emesis and maroon stools.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a duodenal ulcer.
On [**2128-11-8**] the patient had bright red blood per rectum with a drop in his hematocrit from 27.2 to 21.6.
FAMILY DISCUSSION:  Given large pituitary macroadenoma, progressive hypoxia secondary to hepatopulmonary syndrome, with no available medical therapy, a family discussion was held with the patient's brother and friend.
Given progressive medical illnesses, it was decided that the patient would be do not resuscitate/do not intubate and supportive care only.
Cirrhosis likely secondary to autoimmune hepatitis.
Upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to peptic ulcer disease.
Disseminated intravascular coagulation.
