Admission Date:  [**2135-1-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2135-1-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2085-2-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Hurricaine  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**] Chief Complaint: Called by Emergency Department as a Code Stroke for Left-sided weakness and aphasia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IV-tPA MERCI clot retrieval  History of Present Illness: NIH Stroke Scale score was 0: 17 1a.
Extinction and Neglect: 1   HPI:  Ms. [**Known lastname 104742**] is a 49 y/o woman with a PMH significant for myelodysplastic syndrome, HTN and hypothyroidism, who presents with left sided weakness.
However, she does not appear to have any recent febrile illnesses and there is no current chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations or abdominal pain.
Past Medical History: -HTN -gout -hypothyroidism -myelodysplastic syndrome -alcohol abuse -lumbar surgery (exact nature of surgery unknown)   Social History: She was previously employed as a hairdresser, though says she hasnt worked in 4 years.
Not reported by patient, but there is apparently a history of alochol abuse.
Naming generally intact, with some errors on low frequency objects.
Sensory loss left face.
Motor: L hemiparesis- no antigravity ability at all on left.
Sensory: Light touch intact at times when testing sensation, but sometimes she would not realize when someone was holding her left arm, indicating a possible sensory componenent.
Likely retrograde collateral flow present, reconstituting more distal branches of this vascular distribution.
CT head [**1-21**]:Hyperdense regions within the head of the right caudate nucleus and right lentiform nucleus.
Evolving right basal ganglia hemorrhage with underlying infarct with intraventricular extension of hemorrhage and 3 mm leftward shift.
Persistent moderate left subgaleal hematoma, felt to be due to anticoagulants on earlier studies- correlate clinically.
Paranasal sinus disease.
No new foci of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Expected interval evolution of the known right basal ganglia hemorrhagic conversion, with interval decreased attenuation of the hyperdense hemorrhagic foci but increase of peri-hemorrhagic edema.
Essentially unchanged mild leftward shift of normally midline structures, with persistent effacement of the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Unchanged trace intraventricular hemorrhagic extension at the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] without developing hydrocephalus.
Interval decreased soft tissue swelling and hematoma in the left temporal and frontal region.
Paranasal sinus disease as described above.
Right basal ganglia hemorrhage/hematoma is again noted.
Brief Hospital Course: Initial Assessment:  Ms. [**Known lastname 104742**] is a 49 y/o woman with a PMH significant for myelodysplastic syndrome, HTN and hypothyroidism, who presents with sudden onset left sided weakness.
On her exam, her NIHSS is 17 and she has a dense left sided hemiparesis as well as right gaze deviation, left hemianopia and neglect.
Her imaging shows an occlusion of R MCA near its origin.
Her history, exam and imaging are consistent with acute embolic stroke in R MCA.
The plan at this time is to proceed with tPA infusion and if clinical exam remains unchanged in 30 minutes, then plan is to proceed with angio for IA tPA vs. Merci.
There was no improvement with tPA, and she developed hematomas of the right knee, left scalp, and left clavicular area, so IV TPA was stopped.
This resulted in opening of inferior division of the right MCA, but opening of the superior division was unsuccessful.
Her CT scans showed hemorrhagic conversion in the Right striatum and white matter.
She had an transthoracic echocardiogram which showed no ASD or LV thrombus.
There was mild pulmonary hypertension.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was attempted, however Ms. [**Known lastname 104742**] developed methemoglobinemia (level 29) after receiving benzocaine spray.
She received Methylene blue 140mg IV by anesthesia and had rapid clinical improvement.
A transthoracic echo with bubble was later done which showed No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
She had lower extremity doppler studies which were negative for DVT.
Heme: Due to her myelodysplastic syndrome and bleeding with tPA, heme-onc was consulted, and they did not believe there were any restrictions on her stroke management due to her MDS.
Additionally, the team spoke with her outpatient hematologist who confirmed no need for epo or aranesp while in the hospital.
CIWA was discontinued and she had no further symptoms prior to discharge.
She had an XR which showed no evidence of cortical disruptions suggestive of fracture or AC separation.
2. senna 8.8 mg/5 mL Syrup Sig: Five (5) ML PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
7. trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: -Stroke (Right PCA+MCA-territory infarction)  Secondary diagnoses: - EtOHism / withdrawal - chronic LBP - chronic mild anemia, possible MDS - methemoglobinemia secondary to benzocaine spray.
Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after you had a large stroke.
You initially received TPA in attempt to break up the clot in your brain, however this did not improve your symptoms and you developed bruising.
You then had a MERCI retrieval which was able to open up part of your blood vessels.
You were started on medication, Lovenox, and Aspirin, to prevent further clots and strokes.
You had multiple tests including head CT scans, attempted brain MRI, echocardiograms, and ultrasounds of your legs to determine the cause of your stroke.
You also developed a reaction to benzocaine spray, called methemoglobinemia, in which you developed breathing problems requiring treatment in the ICU.
