She has been admitted for chemotherapy in preparation for donor lymphocyte infusion vs. second bone marrow transplant.
She reports feeling "lousy" for the past several weeks, with feelings of fatigue and lack of stamina.
She reports a headache and fever to 100.5 last night which came down with Tylenol.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGY HX: - Acute myelogenous leukemia s/p allo transplant - [**2110-8-4**]: 5 of 6 matched family member allogenic BMT for AML.
She has remained in complete remission; no GVHD.
- mid-[**7-10**] found to have peripheral blasts and host cells in marrow, suggestive of relapsed AML, planning for DLI .
Allergic rhinitis 3.
Depression  Social History: Married, lives with her husband and three children ages 13, 8, 6.
No tobacco or EtOH.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T 98.6  BP 107/67  P 98  RR 18  O2sat 98% Gen: Well-appearing, no acute distress HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, OP clear, MMM Neck: No LAD Card: RRR, normal S1/S2, no m/r/g Pulm: CTA bilaterally Back: No CVAT, mild tenderness around percutaneous nephrostomy insertion site, ecchymoses Abd: Soft, non-distended, RUQ and epigastric tenderness Ext: No clubbing or cyanosis, 1+ non-pitting edema bilaterally, 2+ pulses bilaterally Skin: Some ecchymoses, no rashes Neuro: A&Ox3, responds appropriately  Pertinent Results: Urine cytology : NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
RUQ U/S [**10-23**]: Mildly distended gallbladder.
Mildly distended common bile duct.
HIDA can be performed for further evaluation if clinically warranted.
Ascites and edema of the small and large bowel.
The appearances may be consistent with enteritis or a graft versus host disease.
No evidence of perforation.
Moderate dilation of right kidney.
Unchanged appearance of low attenuation lesions in pancreas and liver.
[**2114-11-5**] BONE MARROW CORE BIOPSY: DIAGNOSIS: Markedly hypocellular bone marrow with extensive fibrosis and focal increased blasts, see note.
The core biopsy shows extensive areas of grade 3 reticulin fibrosis.
An immunohistochemical stain for CD34 highlights a focal area with increased interstitial blasts within the extensively fibrotic background, which likely represents minimal residual disease.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION.
Peripheral Blood Smears: Red blood cells show hypochromasia and anisopoikilocytosis with rare microcytes, red cell fragments and dacrocytes.
One bony piece is  hypocellular with new bone formation and likely represents previous biopsy site.
A second bony core fragment contains diffuse background fibrosis occupying more than half the length of this piece.
A small lymphoid aggregate is seen.
Maturing myeloid and erythroid precursors are extremely scant.
The CD34 stain highlights scattered interstitial mononuclear cells within the fibrotic areas overall comprising ~10% of marrow cellularity (the remaining being lymphocytes and plasma cells).
Renal U/S: IMPRESSION: No definite evidence of hydronephrosis.
Likely right-sided ureteral jet.
No left ureteral jet identified.
[**2114-11-15**] Antegrade Nephrostogram:IMPRESSION: Persistent narrowing of the distal left ureter, probably from the extrinsic compression, unchanged from the study from one month ago   Brief Hospital Course: #) AML.
She tolerated MEC, but her course was complicated by severe mucositis.
pain was controlled with Fentanyl PCA.
She also developed diarrhea (C. diff and other stool cultures negative and symptomatically treated with immodium).
Day 14 marrow revealed markedly hypocellular bone marrow with extensive fibrosis and focal increased blasts.
#) Abdominal pain: Patient was admitted with complaints of mild abdominal discomfort.
Then, on AM of [**10-23**], developed worsening abdominal pain, diffuse, worse in LLQ.
KUB negative for free air and obstruction.
She was given lorazepam 1g IV for anxiety and sent for CT abd/pelvis without contrast.
She also received morphine 1mg IV for pain with little relief.
Abd CT revealed ascites and edema of the small and large bowel.
The appearances may be consistent with enteritis or a graft versus host disease with no evidence of perforation.
Ultimately, this was felt not to be an acute surgical abdomen.
Following diuresis, her abdominal pain also subsided.
By the time of discharge, she was feeling well without abdominal discomfort.
#) Hypotension: In the setting of severe abdominal pain, she was found to have SBP in 80's, which responded well to fluid boluses.
#) Fevers: Beginning on [**11-7**], she developed fevers to 101.
There was concern for a line infection from her left IJ, which waspulled.
The tip was sent for culture, but no organisms grew.
Blood cx subsequently grew out Lactobacillus X3.
Ertapenam as QD antibiotic was discussed, but as there was no literature to support its efficacy against lactobacillus, she was discharged with VNA services to help administer her IV meropenam.
By dicharge, she had been afebrile for greater than 72 hours.
#) Hydronephrosis: Patient has a history of obstruction of her ureters.
The etiology remains unclear as the ureters behave as if there is external compression, but there are no compressing masses seen on any imaging.
On [**11-10**], she developed R flank pain (very mild and intermittent) as well as decreased urine output.
There was concern for right ureteral obstruction as well, but Abd U/S revealed normal flow through R ureter.
She had a antegrade nephrostogram, which revealed essentially unchanged partial obstruction of left ureter with only minimal and slow flow.
She was started on TPN for nutrition given her abdominal pain and was gradually weaned off.
Loperamide 2 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for diarrhea.
Line care Please flush and care for line as per IV network protocol   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: VNS of [**Location (un) 7188**] and [**Location (un) 16221**] County  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: AML lactobacillus bacteremia ureteral stricture   Discharge Condition: good   Discharge Instructions: You have AML and received induction chemotherapy during this admission.
During this hospital course, you have some narrowing of your left ureter requiring the nephrostomy tube to be in place.
Also, you have a bacteria called Lactobacillus growing in your blood.
