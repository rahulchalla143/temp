male who presented  with a 9-month history of abnormal liver function tests, painless jaundice, pruritis.
He presented for elective ex lap with possible Left hepatic lobectomy.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2128-4-9**] 6:28 PM CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST Reason: PO AND IV CONTRAST; eval for enterocutaneous fistula or pseu Field of view: 39 Contrast: [**Hospital 13288**] [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 80M s/p exploratory laparoscopy, roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy, cholecystectomy for unresectable cholangioCA s/p wound infection with open wound.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: PO AND IV CONTRAST; eval for enterocutaneous fistula or pseudoaneurysm.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Visualized lung bases demonstrate small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis.
A large amount of free intraperitoneal air remains, which this far out from the patient's surgical procedure is highly unusual.
There is mild-to-moderate ascites around the liver, and throughout the abdomen.
There has been interval placement of percutaneous biliary tube, which enters the mid abdomen and transits the biliary system, through the patient's known cholangiocarcinoma, terminating with its tip in a loop of small bowel in the region of what appears to be the patient's hepaticojejunostomy loop.
Heterogeneous low- attenuation mass in segment IV, consistent with known cholangiocarcinoma is unchanged.
Previously noted pneumobilia has resolved.
No discrete fluid collection or abscess is identified.
Midline anterior abdominal wall incision site, with surgical staples appears to have worsened in the interval, and there is now evidence of breakdown of the subcutaneous tissues in the anterior abdominal wall, as well as a small amount of inflammatory stranding and fluid.
Air is seen within a somewhat distended urinary bladder, which may be related to prior instrumentation.
There is no abnormal pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions are seen.
Continued evidence of large volume of free intraperitoneal air is concerning in a patient this far out from surgical procedure.
No evidence of discrete fluid collection or abscess.
Infiltrative cholangiocarcinoma in segment IV is unchanged from prior exams.
Moderate ascites throughout the abdomen.
Interval degradation of anterior abdominal wall wound adjacent to incision site, with evidence of inflammatory change and fluid in the anterior abdominal wall, but no breakdown of the deep fascia.
No definite fistula is identified.
Brief Hospital Course: He was taken to the OR for  diagnostic laparoscopy with conversion to exploratory laparotomy, common bile duct excision and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.
Intraoperative ultrasound was performed which demonstrated a large mass in the medial segment of the left lobe.
He did well postop with pain controlled by dilaudid.
On pod 3 he experienced new onset AFIB requiring IV lopressor for rate control.
Diet was advanced without nausea or vomiting.
On [**3-29**] a tube cholangiogram was done demonstrating right moderate narrowing at the anastomosis, likely representing post-operative edema without anastomotic leak.
The Left cholangiogram demonstrated diffuse ductal dilatation with lack of opacification of the central ducts and retraction and malpositioning of the left-sided biliary catheter.
No anastamotic leak was noted, but contrast extravasated in the left subcapsular region was noted likely related to contrast leaking via sideholes of the catheter outside of the biliary system.
No evidence of oral contrast extravasation was noted to indicate the presence of a leak.
Large volume intra-abdominal free air, stranding in the region of the porta hepatis, and small intra-abdominal ascites were noted consistent with recent surgery.
There was a small amount of pneumobilia.
There was a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
He experienced hypotension with melena with hct drop to 21.3.
A tagged RBC study was done revealing no active GI bleeding.
EGD revealed no upper GI bleed.
Purulent drainage was noticed from his abdominal wound and it was opened at the bedisde in the SICU and wet-to-dry dressings were applied.
His fole was discontinued, however, was required to be replaced due to difficulty voiding.
He was trasnfused 1 unit PRBC and had a single bloody bowel movement.
Serial hcts did not demonstrate a acute decrease in his hct and he was deemed stable for discharge home with transition to hospice care on [**2128-4-10**].
