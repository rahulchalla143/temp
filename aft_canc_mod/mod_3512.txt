Small locules of air at the right apex and linearly at the right base laterally, at the site of chest tube entry, likely reflect small locules of pleural air.
No large pneumothorax.
[**2164-2-6**] There is no change in the right apical opacity as well as in the position of the two right chest tubes.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.
Since the patient has gone to water seal, there has been mildly increased right apical pneumothorax with fluid at the right apex.
There is increased density in the right lung with possible mild volume loss.
There is a small left-sided pleural effusion with left lower lobe atelectasis.
There is minimal atelectasis at the right lung base as well.

Due to right upper lobe apical wall invasion, a biopsy was performed.
His chest tube remained water-seal for a right apical pneumothorax which resolved.
