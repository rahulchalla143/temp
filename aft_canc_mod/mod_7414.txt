Admission Date:  [**2104-3-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2104-4-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2040-6-29**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfonamides / Penicillins / Zestril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**] Chief Complaint: CP and SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: thoracentesis  History of Present Illness: 63 yo F with NSCLC s/p chemo and radiation now presenting with worsening dyspnea and intermittent CP.
Pt reports that for the last 3-4 days has had decreased energy and feeling like her breathing has been shallow.
+cough productive of clear/opaque white sputum and had a few episodes of vomiting after vigorous coughing.
No fevers but had night sweats x several nights.
States 2 days ago had one episode of CP in middle of chest which felt like an intense pressure/squeezing.
Had no SOB, N/V, diaphoresis at the time.
Took an aspirin and states the pain resolved after a few minutes and has not returned.
States her SOB has generally been a little better this week, but noticed that upon trying to get dressed to come to the ED it took her several hours b/c she kept having to stop to take breaks to catch her breath.
CTA showed PE and heparin gtt was started.
Onc history: In [**8-23**] presented with cough x 1 month - CXR showed a LUL mass.
Bronch showed adenocarcinoma that was felt to be unresectable as it was invading the mediastinum.
Was treated with cisplatin and etoposide x 2 cycles and repeat CT's showed overall large mass having shrunk in size, but increase in the number of pulmonary nodules.
Thus, she was changed to Taxotere and received 3 cycles but then developed a rash on her hands and feet, neuropathy, and increased SOB so this was stopped.
She has recently decided to enroll in a clinical trial but has not yet started chemotherapy treatment.
ROS: Also c/o white, non-painful spots in mouth for the last 2 days.
Had 3 episodes of diarrhea a few days ago - last was 2 days PTA.
No other bleeding.
Past Medical History: -NSCLC as above -HTN -hypercholesterolemia -seasonal allergies -Pelvic inflammatory disease -lipoma -genital warts -seasonal allergies  Social History: works at [**Hospital3 1810**] as administrator, lives with son and grandson, mother of 2 with 4 grandchildren, no etoh use, +smoking, however down to 4-5cigs a day, not sexually active.
HEENT: PERRL, MMM Chest: + absent breath sounds over middle and lower L lung.
Crackles at base of R lung.
CV: tachy, regular, no murmurs or rubs.
ABD: soft NT/ND, +BS with +lipoma on right iliac crest Ext: no edema.
Pulmonary embolus at the right lower lobe.
Increased bilateral pleural effusions, large on left.
While there is certainly atelectasis present, coincident pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Small right-sided pulmonary nodules minimally changed.
New areas of narrowing in the left main bronchus and the left upper lobe bronchus.
Small pericardial effusion.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Unchanged appearance of the brain compared to [**2103-8-20**], with evidence of chronic microvascular infarction.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
A huge pleural effusion is present.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
[**3-24**] PORTABLE AP CHEST: There is near complete opacification of the left lower lobe and probably a combination of effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis.
There is also opacification of the left upper lobe with probable increase in loculated effusion.
Partial aeration of the lingula.
ECG: sinus tachy at 135. nl intervals, nl axis, +LAE, no ST/T abnmlities.
No RV strain.
Pulmonary embolus at the right lower lobe.
Increased bilateral pleural effusions, large on left.
While there is certainly atelectasis present, coincident pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Small right-sided pulmonary nodules minimally changed.
New areas of narrowing in the left main bronchus and the left upper lobe bronchus.
Small pericardial effusion .
LENI [**3-27**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
pCXR [**3-28**] There is continued large loculated left pleural effusion with near total opacification of the left lung.
There is continued small right pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax is identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 63 yo F with Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) status post chemo and radiation who presented with worsening dyspnea and intermittent chest pain.
Her dyspnea was multifactorial due to a diagnosed pulmonary embolism, increased left sided pleural effusions, left lung consolidation and a new area of narrowing noted in the left main bronchus that was initially concerning for external compression.
Malignant Effusion The IP team initially performed a thoracentesis that removed 1L of bloody fluid that was positive for malignant cells.
The IP then subsequently performed a throscopy in order to attempt complete drainage of the pleural effusion and talc pleurodesis.
During the procedure it was noted that the pt had multiple loculated effusions and an irregular appearing pleural surface which would make it ineffective for successful pleurodesis to occur.
CT surgery was consulted and subsequently the patient underwent a VATS with removal of a large clot (coagulated blood from hemothorax), lysis of adhesions and placement of a chest tube and a Pleurex catheter.
Pt subsequently had her Pleurex catheter drained twice while she was an inpatient, and was sent home with close follow up in CT [**Doctor First Name **] clinic for prn Pleurex catheter drainage as needed.
PULMONARY EMBOLISM: The pt was noted to have a filling defect at an early bifurcation to the posterior basilar segment of the right lower lobe on CTA on initial presentation.
This PE was likely secondary to her hypercoagulable state due to the underlying malignancy.
Pt was started on coumadin, and due to complications with securing Lovenox on her weekend of discharge, the patient was placed on a once daily Fondaparinux 7.5mg qD bridge until therapeutic on her coumadin.
Narrowing of L main bronchus: A Chest CT on admission revealed a LUL collapse with concern of left main bronchus compression.
The consolidation/collapse could have represented atelectasis vs. post-obstructive pneumonia, and patient was placed on Levaquin/Flagyl for empiric post-obstructive PNA coverage.
The pt then underwent a flexible bronchoscopy which showed a near total collapse of the left main stem bronchus with passive exhalation (extrinsic) and complete collapse of left upper lobe bronchus which the IP team thought that was due to extrinsic compression of the bronchi by the pleural effusion.
Because patient remained afebrile with a normal WBC, her Abx were discontinued as the consolidation likely represented atelectasis.
The effusion was noted to be echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
Patient had a normal pulsus paradoxus, and no RV strain or tamponade physiology was seen on ECHO.
Persistant tachycardia: The pt was noted to have stable tachycardia (likely from PE and hypoxia) that persisted throughout her hospitalization.
History of HTN: The pt's BP remained stable without medications.
NSCLC: In [**8-23**] the pt presented with cough x 1 month.
A bronchoscopy showed adenocarcinoma that was felt to be unresectable as it was invading the mediastinum.
The pt has been treated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 553**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (in medical oncology) with Cisplatin and Etoposide x 2 cycles and repeat CT's have shown an overall decrease in size of the mass, but increase in the number of pulmonary nodules.
Thus, the pt was changed to Taxotere and received 3 cycles but then developed a rash on her hands and feet, neuropathy, and increased shortness of breath so this chemotherapeutic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] was stopped.
She has recently decided to enroll in a clinical trial but has not yet started chemotherapy treatment.
However, it was decided that initiation of the new chemo regimen will be deferred to an out-patient follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
