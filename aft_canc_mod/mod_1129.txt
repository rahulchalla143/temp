On POD#1 she developed intermittently low urine output and received additional IV fluids.
Early in the morning on POD#2 she developed mild respiratory distress with a CXR consistent with fluid overload.
However, over the course of the day and into POD#3 she continued to have issues with low urine output and respiratory distress, and was transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring.
*)MICU Course Ms. [**Known lastname 25104**] was transferred to the medical ICU from the surgical team for hypoxia believed to be pulmonary edema.
On transfer she was fluid overloaded with evidence of pulmonary edema.
Her ICU course was complicated by delirium on the night of admission that was controlled with IV haldol.
In addition, while delerious she began to pass bright red bloody stools.
Surgery was made aware and determined this to be consistent with her surgery.
The patient's ICU course was prolonged by atrial fibrillation with a rapid rate that was difficult to control.
When her delirium resolved and she was able to take PO medications, her home regimen with verapamil and metoprolol was adjusted with the assistance of cardiology to control her rate.
*)Post-operative Course (s/p MICU) She was transferred back to the floor and closely monitored, with no further episodes of respiratory distress.
Her diet was slowly advanced with the return of her bowel function, and on discharge she was tolerating a regular diet and her pain was well controlled on oral medications.
*)Atrial Fibrillation Her heart rate was somewhat difficult to control initially, and she had some episodes of tachycardia after her return to the floor.
