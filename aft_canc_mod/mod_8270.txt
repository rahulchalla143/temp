#HEAD TRAUMA/INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGES Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Neurosurgical ICU for Q1 hour neurochecks after having subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhages in his brain after mechanial fall.
Aspirin was held due to his head injury.
He was started on Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis given his extensive head injury.
His neuroligical exam fluctuated likely due to his head injury with underlying cognitive slowing.
He was unable to tolerate PO foods or pills so an NG tube was placed.
# UPPER RESPIRATORY SECRETIONS/COUGH: Pt had some upper airway crackles on exam.
Serial CXRs were negative for pneumonia.
Upper airway crackles likely secondary to patient's poor ability to control oral secretions.
# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: The patient had a persistently altered mental status and was frequently A&Ox0.
These deficits were likely due primarily to recent head trauma, baseline deficits, and delirium.
[**2172-6-14**] EEG indicated mild diffuse encephalopathy.
# Right upper extremity FRACTURE: The pt had marked bruising of his upper extremities bilaterally, which prompted bilateral upper extremity radiographs.
Pt was found to have a right radial fracture.
# THROMBOCYTOPENIA  On admission, pt had a mild thrombocytopenia, which resolved spontaneously during his hospital course.
# RENAL INCIDENTALOMA: On abdominal CT (preparation for ?PEG placement), the pt was noted to have an isodense 1.6-cm renal lesion.
We did not pursue this finding further, given the patient's age, active medical issues and comorbidities, and absence of renal/urologic symptoms.
# ELEVATED CREATININE/Chronic Kidney Disease: During his admission, the pt's serum creatine ranged from 1.3 to 1.5.
