However along the peripherial medial border are multiple cystic components, the largest measuring 11 x 8 mm (8:8).
There is a thin rim of enhancing tissue which encompasses the peripheral cystic component.
The solid component of this mass enhances heterogeneously.
On gradient echo sequences, there are foci of "blooming" susceptibility artifact (6:8) suggestive of possible foci of hemorrhage as no areas of discrete calcifications were seen on prior CT examination.
There is extensive mass effect upon the brainstem and right cerebellar hemisphere.
There is a moderate amount of high FLAIR signal in the right and medial portion of the left cerebellar hemisphere (7:6) as well as in the right posterior aspect of the pons, likely representing vasogenic edema.
These findings are suggestive of an obstructive hydrocephalus.
There is high FLAIR signal in the periventricular white matter which is likely sequela of small vessel microvascular disease.
However there is additional periventricular high FLAIR signal seen around the posterior temporal horns (7:13) which may reflect transependymal migration of CSF secondary to patient's obstructive hydrocephalus.
There is upward transtentorial herniation with effacement of the ambient and quadrigeminal plate cisterns.
There is no shift of midline structures, and there is no evidence for acute vascular territorial infarction.
No additional mass is identified.
Extra-axial mass in the right cerebellopontine angle cistern, with extension through the right porus acusticus into the internal auditory canal.
This mass enhances heterogeneously and has peripheral cystic components.
There is no evidence for fat or calcification within this mass.
Given the imaging characteristics, this very likely represents cystic degeneration within a large vestibular schwannoma.
Malignant schwannoma is a more remote consideration.
There is compression of the fourth ventricle with resulting enlargement of the third and lateral ventricles, representing obstructive hydrocephalus with likely transependymal migration of CSF.
Upward transtentorial herniation with effacement of the ambient cisterns.
CT/CTA Head [**2158-7-17**]: CT Head: There is a 4.7 x 3.0 cm mixed cystic and solid heterogeneously enhancing right CPA angle mass extending into the right IAC causing remodeling and enlargement of the porus acusticus.
The mass closely abuts the right lateral aspect of the basilar artery without encasement.
There is patchy hypodensity involving the bilateral centrum semiovale, corona radiata, and periventricular regions likely representing chronic microangiopathic small vessel ischemic changes in a patient of this age.
There is enlargement of the ventricular system, with interval decrease in size when compared to the prior exam.
There is a new right frontal burr hole with a hypodense track extending to the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle, likely from a prior ventricular catheter.

There is mucosal thickening of the bilateral maxillary antrum.
There is fluid within the left mastoid air cell.
CTA HEAD: ANTERIOR CIRCULATION: There is a 2.2 mm outpouching arising from the distal M1 segment of the left MCA and which points anteriorly.
The remainder of the anterior circulation is unremarkable with no other aneurysms identified.
There is no evidence for stenosis or AVM.
There is calcification involving the bilateral intracranial carotid arteries causing mild narrowing of the right cavernous segment internal carotid artery.
There is calcification involving the intradural segments of the bilateral vertebral arteries causing no significant stenosis.
There is no evidence for aneurysm, AVM, or stenosis.
Large right CPA angle mass causing inferior displacement of the right vertebral artery (intradural segment), right PICA and AICA which drape along the inferior aspect of the mass.
MRI/MRV Head [**2158-7-20**]: BRAIN MRI: There is a large right cerebellopontine angle partially cystic and partially solid mass identified which is unchanged in appearance compared to the prior MRI of [**2158-7-11**] and CT of [**2158-7-12**].
The mass extends into the internal auditory canals and is consistent with a cystic schwannoma.
There is mass effect on the cerebellum and compression of the fourth ventricle.
There is moderate dilatation of the lateral ventricles including temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] seen indicative of obstructive hydrocephalus.
IMPRESSION: Preoperative study demonstrates a large cerebellopontine angle schwannoma measuring approximately 4 cm in size in the transverse and superior inferior dimensions and approximately 4.5 cm in the anterior-posterior dimension.
There is air underlying this, which may also be due to surgical packing material.
At the site of prior right CP angle mass is now predominantly low to isodense material without evidence for hemorrhage at the postoperative site.
The cerebellum remains leftward deviated as does the brainstem and there is a persistent low lying right cerebellar tonsil (2:4) unchanged from preoperative examination.
There is prominence of the third ventricle, temporal horns and lateral ventricles, which appear stable to minimally increased compared to the preoperative MRI examination demonstrating persistent hydrocephalus.
There is pneumocephalus in the region of the basilar cisterns (2:10).
There is a small foci of hyperdense material layering in the left lateral occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] (2:18) likely due to a small area of hemorrhage layering dependently.
No other areas of hemorrhage are identified.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
There is minimal periventricular white matter hypodensity, likely small vessel microvascular infarcts.
There is a right frontal burr hole with a hypodense tract through the right frontal lobe, which is unchanged and likely represents a prior ventriculostomy catheters tract site.
There is pneumocephalus layering non- dependently along the right frontal convexity (2:12) and anterior to the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] (2:9), likely all postoperative in nature.
There is trace fluid in the left mastoid air cells, which is a stable finding.
Status post resection of a right CP angle mass with right craniectomy with metallic surgical mesh at the site of craniectomy.
There is hypo to isodense material filling the region of the prior CP angle mass without evidence for hemorrhage in the postoperative bed.
However, there is a small foci of blood layering in the dependent portion of the left lateral occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] (2:18).
Persistent enlargement of the temporal horns, third ventricle, and lateral ventricles, with narrowing of the fourth ventricle, which appears stable to minimally increased, and is representative of persistent hydrocephalus.

Status post resection of a right CP angle mass with right craniectomy with overlying metallic surgical mesh at the site of craniectomy.
There is hypo to isodense material filling the region of the prior CP angle mass without evidence for hemorrhage in the postoperative bed.
However, there is a small foci of blood layering in the dependent portion of the left lateral occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] (2:18).
Persistent enlargement of the temporal horns, third ventricle, and lateral ventricles, which appears stable to minimally increase and is representative of persistent hydrocephalus.
Multiple foci of pneumocephalus as described, likely all postoperative.
Persistent leftward deviation of the brainstem and cerebellum with persistent low lying right cerebellar tonsil.
CT Head [**2158-7-24**]: FINDINGS: There is a right occipital craniotomy, now with mesh placement.
This is associated with interval removal of the cerebellopontine angle mass noted on the [**2158-7-13**] exam.
There is a hypodensity noted in the right cerebellopontine region, exerting mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
This may represent edema versus an infarct/ischemia; may consider an MR if clinically warranted.
The ventricles are dilated, although they exhibit no significant change from previous exam.
There is diffuse soft tissue swelling along the right aspect of the head.
IMPRESSION: Hypodensity of the right cerebellopontine region, likely edema, but cannot rule out ischemia/infarct; consider MR if clinically warranted.
