Additionally, the dilated bowel demonstrates enhancing thickened wall, which because of its diffuse extent is likely reactive from carcinomatosis .
2) Pancreatic carcinoma with extensive metastases as described above, with peritoneal carcinomatosis.
3) Occluded splenic vein as before.
Moderate ascites.
Right hepatic lesion previously characterized as a hemangioma.
A CT showed extensive dilatation and fecalization of the majority of the large and small bowel, with transition point at the mid sigmoid colon at which there appears to be abnormal soft tissue suspicious for peritoneal implants causing distal large bowel obstruction.
