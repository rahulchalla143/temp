Patient reports pain was [**9-19**] in severity.
She was otherwise asymptomatic, denying shortness of breath or coughing at presentation.
She experienced R flank pain previously for which she had applied a fentanyl patch with adequate pain control.
The patient's cancer initially presented as syncope and further work-up revealed pericardial/pleural effusion [**2181-5-10**].
The pleural fluid revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma and the pericardial fluid a well-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma.
The patient has had 3 recent admissions: on [**5-16**] for dyspnea and [**6-6**] and [**6-14**] for dizziness/syncope.
On admission [**6-6**], the patient had pericardiocentesis and balloon pericardiotomy with removal of 520 cc of bloody fluid.
[**Month/Year (2) **] [**6-11**] (EF>55%) suggestive of pericardial constriction, although unchanged in size since prior admission.
During admission on [**6-14**], cardiology team saw the patient and recommended trial of low dose beta blocker for rate control; a pericardial window was not performed because the effusion was determined to be stable and symptoms thought to be related to dehydration and tachycardia.
Subsequent CT of the torso did not reveal a primary source but did reveal bony lytic lesions in the right ischium and bilateral ilia concerning for metastatic disease.
She also underwent an upper and lower endoscopy without evidence of a  primary lesion.
Considering pericardial and pleural fluid pathology, a subtle gastric or pancreatico/biliary tumor was suspected and the patient was started on gemcitabine/irinotecan.
presented to ED with tachycardia above baseline in 130s to 140s.
Patient has h/o resting tachycardia 115-120.
Electrocardiogram in the ED showed sinus tachycardia unchanged from prior.
Radiography showed reaccumulation of pulmonary edema and CT of the chest showed no acute changes.
In addition, after the procedure, the patient complained of increased shortness of breath increased from baseline, patient's O2 saturation was in the 90s.
Patient was admitt-ed to ICU for pain control and management of tachycardia in setting of pleural effusions.
- History of mild asthma, inhalers not used for several years.
- recent pericardial effusion/tamponade - right pleural effusion - large common femoral DVT - adenocarcinoma of unclear primary   Social History: She works as a nursing assistant.
Family History: Her father died of stomach cancer at age 72.
Mother died of colon cancer at age 63.
No oral lesions Neck: Supple CV: Tachycardic, regular, no M/R/G.
No HSM or tenderness.

C.dif - negative Blood and urine cx: no growth .
CXR ([**7-11**]): IMPRESSION:  Increased size of now large right pleural effusion and minimally increased now moderate left pleural effusion.
Diffuse peribronchovascular opacity with air bronchograms involving the right middle and right lower lobes post thoracentesis.
Given the rapid evolution of this process, findings likely represent pulmonary edema.
Pulmonary hemorrhage or multifocal pneumonia is less likely.
Large left pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Minimal pericardial fluid.
No pneumothorax or reaccumulation of the right pleural effusion.
Unchanged moderate left-sided pleural effusion.
Patchy opacities at the right lung base have cleared since the prior examination, likely representing pulmonary edema given its rapid improvement; mild persistent residual pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 55 y/o woman with metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary (likely discrete gastric or pancreaticobiliary ca) admitted with tachycardia in the setting of malignant pericardial effusions and uncontrolled pain.
# Malignant Effusion - The patient presented for outpatient therapeutic thoracocentesis [**7-12**] (done for worsening SOB) with removal of 2200 mL R sided fluid, followed by excruciating pain at thoracotomy site.
It was decided that thoracentesis was not warranted as her pleural effusion was significantly smaller after the procedure.
Her respiratory distress rapidly improved with diuresis and she was soon back to baseline (requires home O2).
# Mucinous adenocarcinoma of unknown primary: The patient began chemotherapy on [**2181-6-15**] with Gemzar and CPT-11 for metastatic disease.
She did not experience significant nausea during hospitalization, but continued to have diarrhea related to her chemotherapy which was treated with Lomotil.
# DVT/PE - She is s/p IVC filter placement on [**2181-5-30**] s/p DVT of common femoral.
# Pain - Patient had known lytic lesions, with high risk of pathologic fracture.
Bilateral hip xray on [**6-12**] demonstrated no progression of known metastatic lesions.
Also with pain at site of thoracentesis.
She was treated with home fentanyl 25mcg patch for pain control, home lidocaine patch with morphine for breakthrough pain   Medications on Admission: 1.
Zofran 4 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every six (6) hours  as needed for nausea.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Nausea.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Lomotil 2.5-0.025 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every [**3-16**] hours as needed for diarrhea.
Malignant pleural effusion 2.)
Mucinous adenocarcinoma of unknown primary   Discharge Condition: fair   Discharge Instructions: You were in the hospital because of pain and difficulty breathing after your thoracocentesis (or pleural fluid drainage).
You were given medications to help get fluid off of your lungs and pain medications.
If you feel worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, abdominal pain or if your condition worsens in any way, seek immediate medical attention.
