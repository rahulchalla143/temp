Still present left lower lobe opacity, which might be consistent with aspiration.
Endoscopy (EGD)[**2178-7-29**]: Ulcers in the gastroesophageal junction Blood in the whole stomach Ulcer in the duodenal bulb Ulcerated area in the cardia Otherwise normal EGD to duodenal bulb  Angiography [**2178-7-30**]: Tumor encasement of distal common and proper hepatic arteries and proximal middle and right hepatic arteries and gastroduodenal artery.
GDA is severly stenosed but was successfully coil embolized with no further antegrade flow seen.
Probable underlying hepatic cirrhosis in this patient with tumor encasement of hepatic and gastroduodenal arteries.
No signs of active bleeding on the selective arteriograms of the SMA, hepatic, and left gastric arteries.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 year old man with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer s/p cyberknife and current rx with gemcitabine here with UGIB.
[**Month (only) 116**] also be related to the CBD stent placed [**8-3**] although less likely with normal LFTs and no abd pain.
Endoscopy revealed ulcer in the duodenal bulb and ulcerated region in the cardia.
Endoscopy was complicated by a drop in oxygen saturation secondary to sedation.
Later that day pt underwent angiography which revealed no actively bleeding vessels.
It showed tumor encasement of distal common and proper hepatic arteries and proximal middle and right hepatic arteries and gastroduodenal artery.
The decision was made that there are no appropriate interventions at this time.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital1 3894**] Health VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to locally invasive pancreatic cancer; anemia secondary to blood loss Secondary: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the ICU after experiencing an episode of upper GI bleeding that was evident by your vomiting a large quantity of blood.
Gastroenterology performed an upper GI scope to confirm your pancreatic cancer as the cause of the bleeding.
Angiography was performed in an attempt to close off the bleeding vessel.
However there was subsequent bleeding after the procedure.
It determined that there is no intervention at this time that would effectively prevent future bleeding.
