In [**11-16**] he had elective cath showing 90% restenosis at proximal edge of previously placed stent, treated with overlapping Cyper stent.
In [**2-18**] pt had a left femoral artery to dorsalis pedis artery bypass graft with an in situ greater saphenous vein graft.
Of note, at cath [**4-30**], he had a totally occluded right external iliac artery.
Since that time, per the pt, he felt at baseline, with the exception of intermittent left leg pain (s/p vascular surgery, bypass) that would occasionally awaken him at night.
He stated he was up this morning at 4am b/c of this left leg pain, when he developed a "cold rough" feeling in his esophagus similar to his pain that he had with all of his prior MIs.
He noted intermittent right sided chest pain as well last night, which felt like "gas pain", + SOB, no diaphoresis, + nausea, no vomiting.
He states the feeling returned and then persisted, took a 2nd nitro but it only decreased the pain to a [**2192-2-16**].
Some non-occluding stenosis in the distal branches.
He then had BP drop to 90s/40s-50s and a pm HCT was found to be 27.7 (6 point drop from pre-cath HCT).
He is being transferred to the CCU for unstable HCT and hematoma with labile BP s/p catheterization today.
Non-hodgkins lung lymphoma HIV CAD Bladder Ca, s/p resection S/p bowel resection Claudication  Social History: Pt lives alone, formed smoker 1ppd has cut down significantly since lung operations, but smoked for 40 years 1ppd, still smokes a cigarette ocasionally, no EtOH.
HEENT: PERRL, no scleral icterus.
OP clear Neck: JVD to mid neck lying flat Resp: CTAB anteriorly (lying flat) CV: RRR S1 and S2 audible w/o m/r/g Abd: Soft, NT, ND, No hepatomegaly.
Groin: R sided hematoma well circumscribed with some ecchymosis, site c/d/i R Wrist: Site of cath with pressure band over insertion site and some leaking of blood on gauze.
Pertinent Results: CATH [**2188-5-9**] LMCA: nl LAD: 50% mid disease LCX: Total occlusion within proximal stents RCA: not injected Abdominal aortography: mild left common femoral disease.
femoral graft patent with no signficant disease seen in graft or native vessels to above the knee.
PTCA with suboptimal result so 2.5X18 minivision stent placed into larger upper pole which had multiple moderate lesions.

Pt was then found to have a hematocrit drop and hypotension necessitating transfuse to CCU, now stabilized.
Blood loss: Pt was s/p catheterization with R wrist for arterial access and R groin for venous access.
CT scan was performed, and ruled out RP bleed and U/S ruled out AV fistula and pseudoaneurysm.
Pt likely had blood loss during cath, and in groin hematoma.
Low-dose metoprolol was started the night before discharge, and he tolerated this with SBP in the 100s to 110s.
Patient was admitted with a repeat STEMI secondary to instent thrombosis.
His antihypertensives were held due to hypotension, and restarted prior to discharge.
He was not diuresed further, despite an elevated PCWP of 28 at catheterization, due to hypotension.
Hyperbilirubinemia: the pt was noted to have mild jaundice and scleral icterus on [**5-12**].
The hyperbilirubinemia was felt to be most likely due to either reabsorption of the large hematoma or a side effect from one of his HIV meds, most likely atazanavir.
A RUQ U/S showed small gallstones but no evidence of cholecystitis or obstruction.
Hypotension 3.
Acute blood loss anemia 5.
Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet You were admitted because you had another heart attack, from a clot in the stent in your blood vessel.
If you develop chest pain, nausea, vomiting, throat tightness, clamminess or shortness of breath, call your PCP or go to the emergency room.
