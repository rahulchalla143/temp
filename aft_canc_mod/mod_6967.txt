Admission Date:  [**2142-7-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-8-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2086-4-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Percocet / Codeine / Ativan  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**] Chief Complaint: left lower lobe lung cancer recurrance  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p completion VATS Left lower Lobectomy for staple line recurrence [**2142-7-23**] Left upper lobe wedge resection for tear, flexible bronchoscopy.
Redo left thoracotomy with completion left lower lobectomy, Pedicle intercostal muscle flap, Mediastinal lymph nodal dissection.
She subsequently developed 1.5 cm adenocarcinoma of left lower lobe which was treated with a left thoracotomy and wedge excision by my partner, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 175**], on [**2140-11-15**].
Routine followup imaging for both her lung cancer and her lymphoma demonstrated new 1.5-cm nodule along the staple line which is FDG-avid.
This was felt to be most consistent with a recurrent lung cancer along the staple line.
She does have some baseline dyspnea, and our concern was that we would worsen this with completion left lower lobectomy.
However, due to the location of the tumor and the recurrent nature, we felt completion left lower lobectomy was the best treatment and that it was unlikely that we would worsen her dyspnea.

improvement [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 56 year old woman s/p left lower lobectomy s/p CT removal HISTORY: Status post left lower lobectomy, chest tube removal, question improvement.
There is increased lucency at the left lung apex.
I suspect the presence of a small pneumothorax, though this appearance is difficult to distinguish definitively due to overlying clavicle and possible bullous changes as well as pleural thickening.
Pleural thickening along the left chest wall and left costophrenic angle is unchanged compared with one day earlier.
The degree of increased retrocardiac opacity with interstitial markings including right perihilar increased interstitial markings is unchanged.
No right effusion is identified.
Known left-sided rib fracture less well visualized on today's examination.
Focal lucency in left apex - - question artifact versus small stable pneumothorax.
Small-to-moderate sized left pleural effusion is unchanged.
A small degree of left mediastinal shift is unchanged.
PACU course complicated by hypotension requiring epidural off w/ pain control to Dilaudid IV then Dilaudid PCA, neo gtt, low u/o requiring IVF bolus total 3750 cc over 10 hours.
POD#1([**7-24**])- Close monitoring HD on neo gtt, pain control, CT to waterseal w/ mod Ct ouput 130/400 form #1 and #2 respectively, hct, electrolytes, cortisol stimulation test checked- negative.
Pulmonary toilet w/ BS ronchi and interm wheezes.
Pna w/ mucous plugging and therapeutically aspirated.
Desaturation post bronch requiring re-admission to ICU.
Received ativan for sedation and anxiety w/ some somulence- resolved.
In ICU- MS improved to baseline, ventilation improved, pain controlled.
POD#4- Dilaudid PCA for pain, NSR on lopressor then episode of afib requiring amiodarone bolus then converted to NSR- not gtt given- lopressor cont, pulmonary toilet, antibx continue, diuresis.BS course bilat.
CT d/c- CXRY- no ptx.
PCA for pain control cont w/ good effect.
post Hct 30.2 POD#8- BS markedly improved w/ less ronchi, ambulation w/ more esase, NSR, no perpheral edema.
