He had a Chest CT which showed a large right sided lung mass with associated right middle and right lower lobe collapse and large circumfrential right sided pleural effusion.
There is also concern regarding possible involvement of the pericardium and myocardium.
He received 4 mg IV morphine in the emergency room with resolution of his dyspnea and right sided shoulder pain.
On review of systems he denies fevers, chills, left sided chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain, leg swelling, lightheadedness, dizziness, numbness or tingling.

Large FDG-avid right perihilar mass, involving the middle and  upper lobes and associated with extensive right hilar, mediastinal, retrocrural and right supraclavicular FDG-avid lymphadenopathy.
Extensive multifocal FDG-avid right pleural disease associated with a moderate sized pleural effusion increased in volume from the prior study.
There is nodular airspace disease in the anterior right upper lobe having low-level tracer uptake which may be infectious, inflammatory or neoplastic in nature.
There is mild tracer uptake in both adrenal glands, left slightly greater than right, which may be physiologic but should be re-evaluated on follow-up imaging.

The findings are most consistent with a metastatic small cell carcinoma of the lung.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Very small pericardial effusion.
Widespread malignancy in the thorax, most consistent with advanced lung cancer (likely small cell ca and less likely agressive nonsmall cell), with associated mediastinal and pericardial invasion, high- grade narrowing of the superior vena cava, bronchial obstruction, diffuse lymphadenopathy, and malignant pleural disease.
Indeterminate fullness of left adrenal gland.

MICU course: Following admission, patient had a CT scan showing right-sided invasive mass with associated large pleural effusion.
Interventional pulmonology team placed chest tube into right pleural space with greater than two liters of serosanguinous drainage.
Echocardiogram was performed due to invasive vascular appearance of lung mass and noted "Normal biventricular regional and global function.
Very small pericardial effusion."
Given patient's elevated LFTs at presentation, concerning for metastatic disease; however, hepatitis serologies pending.
Patient was hemodynamically stable with no respiratory distress throughout his stay.
CT appearence was consistant with small cell ca vs. agressive nonsmall cell lung cancer of right middle lobe.
He had a thoracentesis during which  2L of serosanguinous fluid were drained, and a chest tube was placed.
Repeat CT showed extensive thoracic malignancy including evidence of pleural metastatic disease.
However, no abnormalities were seen on cardiac echo.
Patient had EBUS/biopsy for tissue diagnosis on [**3-5**], and pathology was found to be consistent with SCLC.
PNEUMONIA: Patient had progressive fever, spiking to 101.5 on [**3-5**].
Given his high risk for post-obstructive pneumonia and chest tube in place, he was treated with a 7 day course fo levofloxacin for presumed post-obstructive pneumonia.
His fevers may have also have been secondary to malignancy.
Elevated ferritin c/w AICD.
Consistent with prior vaccination, but could consider viral load to further eval.

You had imaging studies done that showed a lung mass and fluid.
You also had a biopsy done on this tissue that showed Small Cell Lung Cancer.
You had a PET-CT scan done to determine the extent of this cancer and what types of treatments would be available.
