Admission Date:  [**2155-6-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2155-6-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2078-3-31**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**] Chief Complaint: decreased responsiveness, leukocytosis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bedside debridment of sacral decub  History of Present Illness: Pt is a 77 year old Male with history of parkinson's disease, h/o multiple CVAs, CAD who presented to ED with decreased responsiveness, fevers and leukocytosis.
He lives at home and family and caregivers noted decreased responsiveness for the past 4 days or so.
He had a quarter sized sacral decubitus ulcer which has rapidly expanded over the past 2 weeks with increased eschar.
He was seen by his PCP 4 days ago who started an antibiotic for a leukocytosis, repeat blood work returned with a markedly elevated WBC count for which the PCP recommended the patient be brought to the emergency room.
He had labs notable for acute renal failure with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, as well as a leukocytosis to 26.8 with 97%N, stable thrombocytosis and hematocrit of 30.5.
His INR was elevated at 8.3 and lactate elevated to 3.0.
CXR prelim read showed no infiltrate.
His ECG showed no evidence of peaked t-waves for K of 6.1, he was given kayexelate, bicarb, insulin and glucose.
On arrival to the floor pt was non-responsive to voice, minimally reponsive to stimuli.
Parkinson's disease f/b B+ W neurologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 42389**]; responded well to Sinemet after diagnosis of PD ([**9-/2152**]) was made, has been declining steadily over the past year.
Diverticulosis 4. h/o left MCA stroke in [**6-/2151**]; stroke was thought to be embolic, although no embolic source was found; he was started on  Aggrenox and baby ASA.
HTN 6.
Coronary artery disease s/p MIs [**Numeric Identifier 42390**], s/p angioplasty; 7.
Essential thrombocytopenia on hydroxyurea 9.
Osteopenia 10.
Hyperlipidemia 11.
Postural tremor 12. h/o nephrolithiasis   Social History: Lives at home; 2 home health aides.
Family History: Brother with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer  Physical Exam: Vitals: T:98.6 BP:88/54 P:78 R:19 SaO2: 98% Ra General: Frail, cachectic, elderly man, does not respond to voice, occasional moaning with repositioning.
HEENT: NCAT, PERRL, EOMI, no scleral icterus, MMM, no lesions noted in OP, copius secretions Neck:In neck pillow, tortocollis to right.
Neck veins seen to 7cm Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally, no wheezes, ronchi or rales, unusual respiratory rhythm Cardiac: RR, nl S1 S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated Abdomen: soft, NT, ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
10x8x2" foul smelling sacral decubitus ulcer, tracks 2.5 cm at one point.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
GRAM POSITIVE RODS.
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Left 9th rib posterolateral old rib fracture, accurate age indeterminant.
Septic Shock, bactremia, Septicemia (Gram +), severe Leukocytosis, Bacterial UTI: Although no obvious source was identified for such an inflammatory response, the most obvious sources are urine which grew out sensitive klebsiella and the massive sacral ulcer.
No evidence of pulmonary infection based on CXR or respiratory status.
Per wife no recent diarrhea concerning for c. diff but c-diff toxin assay was negative.
- As speciation of agents was an extended period and there the sepsis was severe, the decision was made to treat broadly with antibiotics to cover GNRs, anearobes and staphylococcus with vancomycin/zosyn (renally dosed) which was ultimately transitioned to unasyn IV after discussion with the ID team.
-agressive fluid hydration for early goal directed therapy, bolus prn for SBP <100, UOP <30 or elevated lactate.
Acute renal failure: - No prior labs since [**2153**], but at that time, baseline creatinine 0.9-1.1.
- Agressive hydration - improved slowly during the admission - All medications were renally dosed  3.
Masive Sacral Decubitus ulcer: - Has rapidly enlarged over past 2 weeks despite wound care at home, now with foul odor, purulent discharge and large eschar, does appear to track, unclear if goes to bone.
Unclear if patient's recent decompensation is due to ulcer or other infection, would expect pt to be less stable if he had osteo with associated bacteremia.
Post procedure the patient had moderate bleeding which was contained with a pressure dressing.
[**Hospital1 **] chemical debridement was recommended for ongoing wound care.
required the transfusion of a total of 4 units of PRBC for correction of acute blood loss anemia.
Tubefeedings were adjusted to optimize nutrition and aid in wound healing.
- Cultures grew out klebsiella, which was sensitive to zosyn, however, more so to unasyn.
Hyponatremia: - Initially admitted with extremely low sodium, so unclear if occult seizures were present, however this was rapidly corrected in the ICU above the danger zone.
ultimately slightly hypernatremic with change to concentrated TF, so this was adjusted back prior to discharge.
Essential thrombocytosis: - hydroxyurea was cointinued - His coumadin was held for coagulopathy, as the risk of bleeding from debridement was higher than thrombosis risk.
Anemia of acute blood loss (at wound debridement) - managed with blood transfusions.
Coagulopathy: On coumadin for h/o stroke and essential thrombocytosis.
Likely elevated in setting of nutritional deficiency combined with recent antibiotic use and hepatic dysfunction from shock liver.
- monitor for bleeding - held coumadin until INR <2,  can be restarted once no evidence of ongoing bleeding.
CAD: - No ischemia on ECG - Continue ASA, statin - Beta-blocker was held in setting of possible sepsis.
Parkinson's Disease: - continued sinemet, methylphenidate  ## Prophylaxis: Heparin SC 5000 tid  ## Code status: DO NOT RESUSCUTATE FOR PULSELESS ARREST (no compressions or shocks) - whould want intubation for respiratory arrest/distress.

Senna 8.6 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: Two (2) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime): hold for loose stools.

Aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Chewable [**Age over 90 **]: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO once a day: can resume once there is no further evidence of bleeding at sacral wound bed.
Coumadin 2 mg Tablet [**Age over 90 **]: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: can resume as secondary stroke prophylaxis only once there is no evidence of ongoing bleeding at the sacral wound (as with aspirin).

requires Q 2 hour mouth care with suctioning to prevent aspiration/mucous plugging  His coumadin and aspirin have been held given bleeding from site of wound debridement - see med list for instructions on resumption.
