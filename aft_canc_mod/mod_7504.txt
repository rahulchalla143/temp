Admission Date:  [**2164-2-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-2-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2101-5-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12**] Chief Complaint: Left hemisphere mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2164-2-15**] craniotomy for mass resection   History of Present Illness: 62yo left handed male presenting with right sided weakness and facial weakness, found to have left centrum semiovale mass.
Today the patient fell off of the bar stool multiple times and was noted to have a clear right facial droop and was sent to an outside hospital for evaluation.
There a head CT revealed L hemishere mass with surrouding edema.
He fell a few days ago and sustained a R forearm abrasion.
+ L arm and leg clumsiness.
No sensory loss.
He denies visual loss.
Lungs: + exp wheezes.
No paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements.
Coordination: Slowing of [**Doctor First Name 6361**] on R.  On discharge : *****************  Pertinent Results: MRI Brain [**2-11**]: Post-contrast brain MRI demonstrates an enhancing mass in the left centrum semiovale with surrounding edema and mass effect on the left lateral ventricle with mild midline shift.
An additional 1 cm mass is identified at the convexity in the right frontal lobe near midline.
The findings are suggestive of metastatic disease.
Right suprahilar mass with multiple pulmonary nodules and left adrenal nodule.
Findings likely represent metastatic lung cancer.
Numerous hypodensities in the liver are too small to characterize, these most likely represent cysts, however, given patient's current imaging findings, cannot exclude metastatic etiology.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] [**2-13**]: The functional MRI demonstrates the expected activation areas at  more than 1 cm from the largest ring-enhancing lesion involving the left centrum semiovale.
The language paradigm demonstrates the major activation areas on the right cerebral hemisphere, likely consistent with dominance, a small area of activation is demonstrated anterior to the mass lesion during the language paradigm.
An additional small mass lesion is demonstrated at the frontoparietal convexity and right parasagittal region, with areas of activation during the movement of the feet adjacent to this area.
FMRI [**2-13**]: The functional MRI demonstrates the expected activation areas at  more than 1 cm from the largest ring-enhancing lesion involving the left centrum semiovale.
The language paradigm demonstrates the major activation areas on the right cerebral hemisphere, likely consistent with dominance, a small area of activation is demonstrated anterior to the mass lesion during the language paradigm.
An additional small mass lesion is demonstrated at the frontoparietal convexity and right parasagittal region, with areas of activation during the movement of the feet adjacent to this area.
Excision of left centrum semiovale mass with minimal expected  postoperative hemorrhage, but no new or unexpected other site of hemorrhage.
Continued edema and compression of left lateral ventricle with mild right parafalcine herniation.
Additional enhancing mass seen on MR four days ago, again not appreciated.
There is a thin area of enhancement surrounding the resection cavity that may be post-surgical in nature, although a small area of residual tumor cannot be excluded.
There is extensive surrounding edema, which is stable in extent and with a stable appearance of the rightward midline shift.
Small focus of enhancement in the right frontal lobe, unchanged since the prior study.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the neurosurgery service on [**2164-2-10**] with a new left sided brain mass.
He then had a CT of the chest which confirmed there was a mass present.
Pulmonary was consulted but they agreed that the patient should have his brain lesion resected prior to any other biopsies.
The prelminary pathology is consistent with carcinoma  He remained neurologically stable and floor orders were written on [**2-16**] and he was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 11.  on [**2-17**] his dysarthra was much improved and it was determined that he would be trasnferred to OMED and the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**].
He remained asymptomatic without complaints while on the OMED service.
He was set up with appropriate outpatient care with a new PCP and new medical oncologist.
Disp:*120 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] VNA and hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: L centrum semiovale mass Pulmonary Mass Adrenal Mass Dysphagia   Discharge Condition: Neurologically Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for removal of a brain mass.
This is likely metastasis from another cancer, likely the lung.
You remained stable and pain free through your post-operative course.
You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.
o	An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).
You are being sent home on steroid medication(tapered dose), make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.
Loss of vision, either partial or total.
Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.
Severe sensitivity to light.
Severe headache or change in headache.
Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
New onset of seizure or change in seizure, or seizure from which you wake up confused.
Due to the complexity of neurosurgical procedures and treatment of neurosurgical problems, effective advice regarding emergency situations cannot be given over the telephone.
Should you have a situation which is not life-threatening, but you feel needs addressing before normal office hours or on the weekend, please present to the local emergency room, where the physician there will evaluate you and contact us if needed.
Please return to the office in [**9-6**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your sutures and a wound check.
