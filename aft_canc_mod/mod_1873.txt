He was recently admitted for altered mental status, and per Neurology his decreased responsiveness, stiff posture, and agitation were likely due to advancing Parkinson's Disease.
CXR was suggestive of mild volume overload and also revealed a possible opacity; aspiration could not be excluded.

Mild fluid overload.
However, aspiration or pneumonia is not excluded.
Worsening right lower lobe pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 29963**] is an 82y/o gentleman with advanced Parkinson's Disease brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED by his wife for possible aspiration and admitted to the ICU given concern of possible airway compromise and need for intubation.
#PNA: Patient admitted with tachypnea, increasing respiratory requirements, elevated WCC, and question of a new opacity on CXR, in the setting of a AMS and question of aspiration.
He was then transfered to the floors, but was transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] a day later in the setting of fevers, decreased arouseability, and low urine output.
At the time of discharge, his WBC had stabilized and he had been afebrile for >24H.
Recently discharged after an episode of "slumping over," with decreased arousability.
Family was aware that his neuro disease had progressed, and that his decreased interactiveness likely represented a new baseline for him.
NG tube was d/c'd and he went home with only medications for comfort and his aspiration pneumonia.
Still with some LV hypokinesis and mod decrease in LV function with EF 40-45%.
Not grossly volume overloaded to exam and breathing issues/hypoxia seem more likely pulmonary in origin.
Anemia: chronic disease, with low iron.
No obvious source of blood loss.
Likely worsened in setting of acute illness.
