Complex small amount of perihepatic and pelvic free fluid.

Based on his physical exam, CT scan and elevated WBC of 16K, exploratory laparotomy was recommended.
After his INR decreased he was taken to the Operating Room on [**2110-5-25**] and underwent an exploratory laparotomy, small bowel resection and anterior enterostomy for infarcted small bowel.
He maintained stable hemodynamics and his pain was well controlled.
Following transfer to the Surgical floor his diet was advanced on post op day #2 after his bowel function returned but unfortunately he developed an ileus and returned to NPO.
His abdomen was soft and his incision was healing well.
Of note, his daily lasix was not resumed and his Coumadin for atrial fibrillation may resume on [**2110-6-2**].

Discharge Instructions: * You were admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain due to poor blood supply to your small bowel.
* Due to the difficulty of going through such a big operation along with your other medical problems, you will need to spend some time in rehab prior to going home so that you can regain your strength and increase your calories so that you can return home safely.
* If you develop any increased incisional pain, abdominal pain or any other symptoms that concern you please call your doctor or return to the Emergency Room.
