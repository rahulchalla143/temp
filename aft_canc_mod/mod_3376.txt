BILIARY STENT  [**2113-2-17**] 9:03 AM [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 83 year old man with likely cholangiocarcinoma with obstructive disease REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Internalize stent INDICATION FOR EXAM: This is an 83-year-old man with CBD obstruction status post right PTBD with external biliary drainage placed, needs procedure to pass the level of the obstruction.
Pullback cholangiogram demonstrates distal CBD obstruction and duodenal obstruction at the level of the ligament of Treitz.
BILIARY CATH CHECK  [**2113-2-20**] 7:22 AM CHOLANGIOGRAM AND STONE REMOVAL AND TUBE CHANGE  INDICATION: 83-year-old man with biliary obstruction, status post biliary and duodenal stenting, now with increasing LFT.
Status post biliary and duodenal stenting.
Percutaneous stone removal with improved appearance of the common duct on the followup cholangiogram.
Brief Hospital Course: He was admitted 0n [**2113-2-13**] with epigastric pain and elevated LFT's.
He likely had metastatic cholangiocarcinoma based on the CT and due to the large amount of ascites and PTC drain was thought to be a better option.
On [**2113-2-15**] he went for a PTC and had successful placement of an external modified 8-French nephrostomy tube via a right biliary with pigtail coiled with it and CBD, and Paracentesis was performed with drainage of 300 cc of serosanguineous ascitic fluid.

He received Morphine for pain control.

He was transferred back to the floor and was stable, but continued to have an elevated WBC, elevated transaminase and a Tbili in the 6-8 range.
On [**2113-3-1**], IP placed a pig-tail drain in the right pleural space and withdrew 500cc of yellowish fluid.
Cultures revealed no growth.
Improved appearance of right pleural effusion, with residual left pleural effusion.
Peribronchial thickening in both lower lobes may represent atelectasis vs infection.
Similar appearance of intra-abdominal ascites.
A small amount of air adjacent to perihepatic drain may be related to frequent flushing.
Similar appearance of left spigelian hernia without obstruction.
Similar appearance of aortic abdominal aneurysm.
Cholangiogram demonstrated dilated ducts with contrast passing through the stent into the duodenum.
CXR revealed no pneumothorax.
