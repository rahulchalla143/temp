He recently travels from [**State **] to [**Location (un) 86**] area for evaluation by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] regarding possible enrollment in a clinical trial.
However, on the day prior to admission, he had sudden onset of dizziness, graying, and blurring of his vision, and lightheadedness along with some evidence of shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain.
His symptoms were transient.
In Emergency Department, he reported that his voice was higher pitched than usual and he noted increased nonproductive cough.
He also complained of increased left-sided neck pain.
His neck pain resolved without an intervention approximately 20 minutes after his arrival.
In the Emergency Department, ultrasound showed a nonocclusive thrombus in the right common femoral vein.
CT scan of the neck demonstrated a large lymphoma approximately 12.2 x 8 cm with the left carotid arteries patent by encased by tumor.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denied fevers, chills, recurrent chest pain, stridor, wheezing, cough, or hemoptysis.
He denied any changes in appetite, weight, or night sweats.
No nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, constipation, dysphagia, or odynophagia.
History of DVT and PE status post six weeks of Coumadin therapy, originally diagnosed in [**2113-1-12**].
Coronary artery disease, status post CABG times four vessels in [**2105**].
ALLERGIES:  The patient was allergic to ciprofloxacin resulting in hives, Vicodin resulting in dehydration, and Humibid resulting in hives.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon transfer:  Generally, he is a well-developed, well-nourished elderly male, breathing comfortably in no acute distress.
Head, neck exam was remarkable for normocephalic and atraumatic.
No oropharyngeal lesions.
Pulmonary exam showed lungs to be clear to auscultation bilaterally no adventitious breath sounds.
There is no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities exam showed bilateral lower extremity edema of right greater than left.
LDH elevated at 341.
Urinalysis negative.
There was slight elevation of left hemidiaphragm with discoid atelectasis at the left base.
A CT scan of the head without contrast demonstrated no acute intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of major vascular territorial infarct.
The patient was noted to have very prominent basilar artery.
CT of the neck demonstrated a large left-sided mass approximately 12.2 x 8.4 cm.
There was marked right tracheal displacement with questionable intraluminal tracheal mass.
The tumor encased the left common carotid but flow appeared patent.
CT of the chest demonstrated no evidence of pulmonary embolus.
There were noted a 10 mm precarinal node.
As well, there were also emphysematous changes at the lung bases.
There were two right-sided upper lobe pulmonary nodules, the largest 6 mm in diameter.
Lower extremity ultrasound showed no flow in the right popliteal secondary to nonocclusive thrombus.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Large B-cell lymphoma with the left neck mass.
This will be completed with vigorous hydration, allopurinol, and serial checks of tumor lysis labs.
On this regimen, the size of his neck mass was decreased.
It was reiterated to the patient several times that at this time he was not a candidate for moment in clinical trial regarding treatment with Zevelin and in light of his rapidly progressive bulky disease, or he might be never be a candidate for such treatment.
The patient was started on heparin and Coumadin when he was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, it is unclear if the right deep vein thrombosis was old or new, I have concern for pulmonary embolus.
There were no signs or symptoms of airway compromise.
He remained without evidence of airway compromise.
Chest pain:  It is unclear that the patient's initial symptoms were more consistent with transient ischemia versus vasovagal episode.
His chest pain resolved on the day of admission.
It was felt to be atypical in character and unlike his previous coronary chest pain prior to his CABG, it was felt to be less likely to be ischemic in nature.
Additionally, he ruled out for myocardial infarction.
No chest pain.
No shortness of breath.
Tolerating well intake without nausea or vomiting.
Right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.
History of pulmonary embolus.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting.
