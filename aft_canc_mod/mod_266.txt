# Elevated lactate: was 4.0 on admission, no evidence of hemodynamic instability throughout her ICU stay, and her lactate trended down with IV fluids.
She had 35 point drop in systolic BP with standing with PT on [**2102-4-6**], for which she received NS bolus.
Florinef 0.1mg was also started on [**4-6**], which can be increased as an outpatient to 0.5mg but with close attention to BP and peripheral edema and respiratory symptoms.
She was seen by neurology at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2102-3-16**] who remarked that She has a history of Vincristine use and diabetes with known neuropathy and an autonomic component may be contributing.

The cause of this is somewhat unknown but may be related to deconditioning/weakness from chemo along with mild hyponatremia as a result of vomitting and suspected mild SIADH.
This improved without intervention and no infectious causes were found on initial workup in the ICU and a head CT was negative for acute changes.
CNS lymphoma is felt to be unlikely as her PET/CT shows no evidence of FDG avid disease.
Neuro-oncology evaluated the patient and noted general deconditioning but did not recommend further testing.
