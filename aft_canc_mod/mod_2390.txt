Admission Date:  [**2127-3-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-3-9**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ICU monitoring, central venous catheter placement, PICC line placement, arterial catheter placement.
History of Present Illness: 89f with large pna requiring intbuation.
Presented from rehab facility, found to have change in mental status with severe respiratory distress, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Pt intubated with use of fentanyl versed, CXR showed R-sided pna "over entire lung."
Physical exam on discharge from that admission was remarkable for abulia and decreased strength on left.
Alzheimer's dementia 3.
Anemia of chronic disease   Social History: Since the R ACA stroke, pt has been living in a rehab.
Fully dependent, as she is hemiplegic on left and alert and oriented to first name only.
Interval development of multifocal airspace opacities in the right lung concerning for pneumonia.
Persistent small to moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions.
Progressive cystic encephalomalacia and volume loss in the distribution of the right anterior cerebral artery, consistent with evolution of prior infarct.
Unchanged sellar region mass, with imaging characteristics most suggestive of a pituitary macroadenoma, without hemorrhage.
No new acute intracranial process, including no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or acule large vascular territorial infarction.
CXR [**2127-3-8**]: Increase in right upper lobe and left upper lobe multifocal opacities, could be aspiration/pneumonia.
Bilateral pleural effusion slightly improved.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, with consolidation vs. atelectasis at the left lung base.
Brief Hospital Course: 89F with shock and respiratory failure likely from pna.
#  Respiratory Failure:  Patient was hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal right lobe infiltrate.
Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for aspiration.
- [**1-5**] blood culture bottles from admission tested positive for enterococcus.
CT abdomen and pelvis was done, which showed no abscesses or specific source of bacteremia.
Given her high risk for c. diff and loose stools, it was again checked on [**3-9**], and the result is pending.
#  Shock:  Patient had fever, hypoxia, and hypotension on presentation.
Most likely this is septic shock secondary to pna.
Less likely cardiogenic (CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).
Could also have component of central adrenal insufficiency given pituitary macroadenoma (eos not elevated or absent).
- MI was ruled out with negative cardiac enzymes - cortisol level was checked (38.3 in AM) .
#  Neuro/ AMS: h/o right ACA stroke recently.
There may be a component of delirium in addition to residual deficits from the large stroke recently.
- Medication list was reviewed and pared down to minimize risk of drug effects - Continued asa and statin .
They were held in the beginning of her hospital stay due to hypotension, then restarted slowly when she became hypertensive.
#  hypocalcemia (even when corrected for low albumin) on admission: unclear cause, however it resolved spontaneously.
Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg tid   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: Aspiration Pneumonia Right ACA CVA  Secondary Diagnoses: HTN Pituitary macroadenoma Alzheimer's Dementia Hyponatremia Hypothyroidism Anemia of chronic disease  Discharge Condition: Fair, VSS, afebrile, responsive to painful stimuli only.
