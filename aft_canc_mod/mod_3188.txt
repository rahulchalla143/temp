Admission Date:  [**2194-12-26**]     Discharge Date:  [**2195-1-19**]  Date of Birth:   [**2195-3-20**]     Sex:  M  Service:  ICU  HISTORY:  Mr. [**Known lastname 2470**] is a 69-year-old male who was transferred to [**Hospital3 **] Medical Center for management of respiratory failure and unresponsiveness.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 69-year-old male with prostate cancer, known metastases to hip, who presented with increased anxiety and poor sleep the week prior to admission which his family attributed to his worrying about rising prostate specific antigen.
In the morning of [**12-20**], the patient's son noticed ankle swelling and the patient was more lethargic with a harder time verbalizing himself, although he continued to follow commands.
His family held the hydrocodone on [**12-20**] because of concerns of his mental status.
He had labored breathing and dry cough on [**12-20**], worse on [**12-21**].
Chest x-ray showed bilateral infiltrates and the patient was started on ceftriaxone and levofloxacin.
CT of the head with contrast was negative for all pathology.
The patient also ruled in for myocardial infarction on [**12-22**] with peak creatine kinase of 300 and cardiac troponin-I 2.1.
At that time, a lumbar puncture had no white cells.
Given his dyspnea on presentation, a computerized tomography of the chest with angiogram was performed which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Other notable abnormal labs included an alkaline phosphatase of 1,000, lactated dehydrogenase of 800, and ammonia of 85, for which the patient has been receiving lactulose.
The patient was extubated on [**12-24**], but developed respiratory distress after 12 hours and was reintubated on the same day.
Prostate cancer diagnosed in [**7-21**], presented with difficulty ambulating.
Treated at [**Hospital3 328**] Cancer Institute.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Ventilator settings: Assist control 700/12, FIO2 40%, no spontaneous breathing, no breathing when ventilator temporarily stopped.
Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, with positive bowel sounds and a pulsating mass in the epigastrium.
Neurologic: Notable for decreased left corneal reflex, normal right.
Unable to elicit biceps, patellar or Achilles' reflexes on either side.
Urinalysis negative.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 90 with right bundle branch block and left anterior hemiblock.
Chest x-ray at [**Hospital1 **] showed mild diffuse pulmonary edema.
No infiltrates.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient's unresponsiveness was felt to have a differential diagnosis including medication effect from narcotics, cerebrovascular accident, infection, anoxic brain injury, hypernatremia.
Respiratory failure felt to have a component of pulmonary edema, but diuresis initially held, give hypernatremia.
Hypernatremia was, in the meantime, repleted with 5% dextrose and water.
Electroencephalogram showed toxic metabolic disorder.
Antibiotics were changed to ceftazidime and vancomycin given the possibility of nosocomial pneumonia.
On [**12-28**], the patient had bursts of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and remained sedated.
Neurology consultation recommended that diminished arousal was likely multifactorial, but secondary to metabolic state.
Exam, however, was confusing for left MCA distribution ischemic event with right facial and arm weakness.
On [**12-29**], MRI was obtained, but, unfortunately, did not include diffusion imaging and Neurology consult recommended repeat MR.  On that day, Cardiology consult agreed with diagnosis of non-Q wave myocardial infarction and recommended increasing beta blockade and adding ACE inhibitor.
It was not clear whether wide complex tachycardia was ventricular tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy.
On [**12-30**], insulin drip was started for elevated blood glucose.
Hypernatremia was persistent and dextrose 5% and water continued to be administered.
On [**12-31**], sedation was entirely weaned due to concerns for a toxic metabolic encephalopathy.
Vancomycin and ceftriaxone continued for copious pulmonary secretions and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray.
Neurology was re-consulted and recommended repeat lumbar puncture and following of pneumonia, electroencephalogram, and ammonia.
On [**1-1**], computed tomography of torso showed bilateral pleural effusions.
Serum ammonia noted to continue to be elevated and lactulose increased.
Tachycardia was interpreted as torsades de pointes.
Suggested consideration of low protein diet for elevated ammonia.
On this day, Liver Service was also consulted for persistent hyperammonemia.
This service recommended continuing to increase lactulose, magnetic resonance imaging of the liver, but no liver biopsy as would not likely change treatment options.
While this was not felt to be relevant to acute presentation, hemochromatosis gene studies were recommended in order to advise family for future screening.
On this day, sputum grew methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus.
The patient also had atrial flutter with short runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
On [**1-5**], the patient had an episode of mucous plugging.
At 4 p.m., he was diaphoretic and anxious.
Continued to have thick secretions.
A family meeting outlined options of aggressive care versus attempt to minimize invasiveness and extubate.
The family agreed to a trial of pain medicines to see if it helped the patient's comfort, rather than favoring continuing to allow the patient to be in pain in long-term failing attempt to improve mental status.
Thirty cc's of spinal fluid were obtained and sent for various studies.
The patient continued to have episodes of tachypnea requiring suctioning and had decreased blood pressure which was felt to be due to excessively rapid diuresis.
He also had an episode of hypoglycemia with blood sugar of 42.
Metoprolol was decreased due to bradycardia and hypotension.
On [**1-8**], patient opened eyes to stimulus and answered yes or no questions, denying pain, agreeing to shortness of breath and repeatedly answered in the affirmative to questions to whether or not he wanted everything done.
Family meeting on that day: The family was advised that his mental status and breathing would require a very prolonged rehabilitation stay from which he would not be expected to recover before succumbing to prostate cancer.
Nerve conduction studies and electromyography were performed and consistent with a severe sensory motor polyneuropathy that was axonal in nature, felt to be most consistent with diagnosis of critical illness polyneuropathy.
On [**1-13**], blood cultures were positive for gram positive cocci in one bottle and vancomycin was given as temperature spiked to 102.1.
Bronchoscopy showed mild secretions and the tracheostomy was placed without complications.
Hypernatremia again noted and free water boluses were again increased.
Blood cultures grew mixed gram positive cocci felt to be possible contamination and only in one blood culture bottle; vancomycin discontinued.
On [**1-14**], Neurology consultation noted that critical illness neuropathy is associated with long periods of being ventilator dependent and wean from ventilator is likely to be quite slow.
On [**1-16**], the patient remained unresponsive to commands.
There was some difficulty with respiration due to internal bleeding around trach site which resolved with epinephrine injections by Interventional Pulmonology fellow.
Hypernatremia was resolved without improvement in mental status.
On [**1-19**], at 2:55 a.m., the house officer was called to see the patient for asystole on monitor and no respiratory rate.
No pulse, heart sounds or spontaneous breaths were noted.
