Admission Date:  [**2176-12-1**]       Discharge Date:  [**2176-12-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2101-11-29**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 75-year-old female with a past medical history of multiple myeloma, chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline of 2.3 to 2.8, breast cancer, and recurrent hypercalcemia, who presented with confusion and hallucinations.
In the ED, the patient was noted to be hyperkalemic with a K of 7.2 and hypercalcemic with a calcium of 13.2 as well as to be in acute renal failure with a creatinine of 7.5.
Multiple myeloma diagnosed in [**2172**], treated with melphalan plus prednisone until [**2173-8-14**], then treated with thalidomide until [**2176-11-13**] in which cause she was treated with decadron.
Multiple myeloma was complicated by multiple osteolytic metastases including ORIF of the right femur pathologic fracture in [**2173**], upper extremity bilateral osteolytic metastases, radiation treatment to bilateral hips in [**2173**], compression fractures of T12, T8, L1 through L4, right 7th rib fracture, left 5th posterior rib fracture, and soft tissue mass of the right chest wall, also complicated by hypercalcemia on chronic diphosphonate treatment, as well as chronic renal insufficiency.
Status post a fall and C2 fracture in [**2175-7-15**].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Nonsmoker and no alcohol.
Lives with his husband, who is her caregiver and has three sons.
In general, cachectic appearing female in moderate respiratory distress.
Cardiovascular:  S1, S2, regular rate, there is a +S4, 2/6 systolic murmur.
Urinalysis:  Positive nitrite, 21-50 red, [**7-23**] white, [**1-2**] epi's, and few bacteria on culture.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral perihilar haziness, pulmonary vascular distribution, unchanged chest wall mass, left posterior rib fracture, and pulmonary edema.
EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm, rate of 76, normal axis and intervals, T-wave inversions in III, peaked T's in V3, otherwise no acute changes.
Renal ultrasound:  No hydronephrosis.
UPEP showed two abnormal bands identified as monoclonal free lambda, and trace [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] protein, and trace intact IgA lambda.
There were positive urine eosinophils.
Hypercalcemia:  Patient was treated with IV fluids, Lasix, and calcitonin x48 hours with excellent response and the calcium trending down.
Patient received IV fluids with no response and throwing the patient into CHF.
There was a broad differential for renal failure including AIN secondary to Cipro, renal toxicity from pamidronate, ATN from prerenal, but ultimately due to the appearance of [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] proteins, which had been negative in the past, it is felt that this is consistent with multiple myeloma cast nephropathy.
CHF:  Patient became fluid overloaded during rapid infusion of IV fluids in the Emergency Room in the setting of acute renal failure.
In the VICU, the patient's course was complicated by an episode of AFib with a rapid ventricular rate that was controlled with a diltiazem drip and eventually with p.o.
An echocardiogram was performed showing moderate left atrial dilation, mild right atrial dilation, EF of 55%, [**2-15**]+ MR, 2+ TR.
Patient had no further problems with fluid overload or AFib throughout her admission.
Coag-negative Staph bacteremia:  Although patient remained afebrile, blood cultures were checked and revealed 4/4 bottles positive for coag-negative Staph.
The patient was treated with Vancomycin and this was felt to be consistent with a line infection.
Patient at this time had both right IJ central venous catheter as well as a left hemodialysis catheter.
The right IJ was removed, and tip sent for culture, which also grew out coag-negative Staph.
Confusion:  Patient with baseline moments of confusion, however, worsened in the setting of this acute illness.
Throughout the admission, patient with episodes of hallucinations as well as confusion, however, remained oriented x3.
As patient's infection improved and electrolytes became normal, there became less and less episodes of this confusion.
Hemolysis laboratories were unrevealing as well as peripheral smear.
Again, there was no clear etiology.
It was felt possibly secondary to liver dysfunction or vitamin K deficiency.
There was no problems with spontaneous bleeding, and therefore, there was no need for FFP.
Increased PTH:  Patient's parathyroid hormone was grossly elevated at 1161.
It was unclear if this represented an acute increase secondary to acute renal failure or represented primary hyperparathyroidism.
Stable vital signs, had baseline mental status, afebrile with negative blood cultures on hemodialysis.
Acute renal failure.
Coag-negative Staphylococcal bacteremia.
Of note, the patient did receive a number of additional studies including a MRI of the head which revealed no brain metastases, however, osteolytic lesions were found of the calvarium as well as a CT of the abdomen with and without contrast which revealed three lesions on the liver suspicious for metastatic disease.
