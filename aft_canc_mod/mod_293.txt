Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated in the trauma bay where primary and secondary survey revealed extensive degloving injuries to bilateral LE and the right arm.
Vascular surgical consultation was obtained with no evidence of vascular injury.
Radiographic evaluation (as above) revealed a left femoral neck fracture, right rib fractures [**4-7**], and a left lateral malleolar fracture.
She was taken to the OR by orthopedic and plastic surgery for repair of her femoral neck and degloving injuries without complications.
Her course is below by system:  Neuro: Patient's CT head and cspine were negative for injuries.
Pain was managed with IV narcotics initially with poor control.
Ketamine and gabapentin were added and a lumbar epidural was placed by the Acute pain service.
At discharge, she had fair pain control with standing tylenol and and ultram, as well as prn oxycodone.
An echocardiogram was obtained to evaluate volume status which showed RV overload with strain, concerning for PE.
Patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation with RVR for which she was loaded with amiodarone.
Pain regimen as above for rib fractures with pleural effusions.
On [**1-10**] she was noted to have some coughing/wheezing after taking some PO's and repeat c-xray was obtained which showed no evidence of aspiration and only slight increase the pleural effusion.
*Of note, a 5 mm pulmonary nodule was noted on her admission CT scan, suspicious for malignancy.
She was started on a bowel regimen to avoid constipation given her decreased mobility and narcotic intake.
At discharge, she had no complaints of abdominal pain or constipation.
GU: Patient was noted to have hematuria on POD#2.
A CT was performed with concern for a posterior contained rupture.
Urologic consultation was obtained and cystogram was performed at the bedside on [**2191-1-8**] with no evidence of bladder or urethral injury.
ID: Treated with ancef for complex wounds.
A wound vac remains to her RLE and was last changed [**2192-1-16**].
