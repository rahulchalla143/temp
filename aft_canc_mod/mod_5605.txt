Her chemotherapy course was compicated by altered mental status with periods of aggitation and somnolence.
She became vol overoaded with concern for decreased UOP unresponsive to lasix and was noted to be 6 lbs heavier than admission.
She then became hypotensive, bradycardic, and non-responsive with SBP 80's-90's, HR 35.
She was transferred to the MICU on [**8-14**] for MTX toxicity for HD/CVVHD.
She was also noted to be in acute renal failure and congestive heart failure.
She  also had some pulmonary edema which has responded to afterload reduction and diuresis.

Moderate PA HTN.
No valvular dz.
Continued areas of edema and enhancement in the left temporal lobe, right occipital lobe, and left cerebellar hemisphere.
The lesion in the left temporal lobe appears to be slightly increased in size and the amount of edema appears to be slightly increased.
However, it is unclear whether this is a real finding or it represented differences in technique.
No new lesions are identified.
There is no pneumothorax.
The pulmonary edema present on [**8-26**] has resolved.
No new intracranial bleed or mass effect is identified.

An EKG showed bradycardia w/o block.
IVF 100cc/h were started for an elevated Calcium and dehydration.
Head CT was without any catastrophic event.
Her hypothermia was concerning for sepsis and pt was initially broadly covered with abx, but then selectively treated with Linezolid for a positive [**Month/Day (4) **] in the urine which was not treated before since thought to be a colonizer.
The exact cause of bradycardia remains unclear.
Initially, thoguht to be an adverse reaction between diltiazem and dilantin, but dilantin would lower levels of diltiazem as a P450 activator.
Bradycardia, hypothermia and hypotension could also have been secondary to urosepsis (pos [**Month/Day (4) **] in urine), but even on appropriate coverage for [**Name (NI) **], pt still had episodes of bradycardia and hypothermia.
The third possible cause would have been involvement of hypothalamic structures by her CNS lymphoma.
No further intervention was done and the patient remained asymptomatic despite bradycardia.
Hypothermia - Pt was hypothermic during her bradycardic episodes.
Thought to be related to urosepsis with [**Month/Year (2) **].
CXR showed no signs of active pulmonary process.
The hypothermia briefly resolved on transfer to the oncology floor.
However, pt still had occasional hypothermic temperatures on the floor again.
Pt was asymptomatic on discharge.
MRI of brain on [**9-11**] showed possible slight progression in left temporal lobe.
Cards were consulted on [**9-9**] b/o previous cardiovascular problems with h.d.
PT consulted for reconditioning and gait.
Seizure d/o - Secondary to CNS lymphoma.
Hypercalcemia - Pt developed hypercalcemia prior to the bradycardic event.
Pt remained asymptomatic and was discharged with a stable, but slightly elevated calcium.
It is suggested to get a sestamibi scan to evaluate for parathyroid adenoma/hyperplasia, as well as a DEXA scan since pt is on longstanding steroids.
Diastolic dysfunction - Pt is known to have diastolic dysfunction in the past.
B/o her bradycardic episode, BB and CCB were held since then.
It is recommended that her PCP is going to follow up and titrate up on the lisinopril dose if BP and renal functions allows.
Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid, TFTs were stable.
Anemia - baseline Hct 28-32.
PPx - heparin, PPI, bowel regimen, mouth care, oral nystatin for thrush .
