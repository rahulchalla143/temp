INDICATION: 51-year-old man with maxillary tumor, status post fall.
FINDINGS: Note is made of hyperintense intensity in the sulci of the bilateral frontal and parietal areas, consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage given the finding on prior CT scan.
There are thin areas of subdural hematoma in bilateral frontal areas, great on the left.
There is hyperintensity within the brain parenchyma in left parietal and bilateral frontal lobes, most likely representing hemorrhagic contusions given the history of trauma.
No abnormal enhancement is seen in the brain.
No area of slow diffusion is noted.
Again, note is made of opacification of bilateral frontal and right maxillary sinuses as well as right nasal cavity, with T1 hyperintense material, persistent since prior studies, probably due to chronic mucous retention.
IMPRESSION: 1) Bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage within the sulci, as well as bilateral thin subdural hematoma, somewhat more prominent on the left.
Hyperintense signal in brain parenchyma in left parietal and bilateral frontal lobes on FLAIR, most likely representing hemorrhagic contusions in this patient with trauma.
2) No area of slow diffusion.
3) Left maxillary surgery, with opacified paranasal sinuses.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report (Revised)  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2113-4-7**] 7:20 AM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: S/P FALL ?BLEED  [**Hospital 5**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 51 year old man with h/o left maxillary tumor resection now s/p fall with head trauma and suspected seizure REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: ?
INDICATION: 51-year-old male with history of left maxillary tumor resection status post fall.
FINDINGS: Study is limited secondary to excessive motion artifact.
Allowing for this factor, there is no acute intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
There is no new major vascular or territorial infarct.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is a small amount of subarachnoid blood in the interhemispheric cistern and in the left Sylvian fissure.
There is an old right frontal infarction.
In this distribution it is difficult to exclude a superimposed acute infarction.
This may be due to a small amount of subarachnoid blood creating isodense CSF within the sulci, but the possibility of swelling due to global hypoperfusion should be considered.
Now with RUE weakness.
COMMENTS: Lateral radiographs of the cervical spine with flexion and extension demonstrated no evidence of fracture or dislocation or translation indicating instability.
There are multiple surgical staples overlying the neck lesion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture, dislocation or instability.
Left hard palate, resection (A-C; F-L):  Recurrent adenoid cystic carcinoma, involving soft tissue; bone with reactive changes, necrosis and acute and chronic inflammation; special stains for bacteria will be sent as an addendum.
Soft tissue and bone, left pterygomaxillary fossa, resection (E,M):  Recurrent adenoid cystic carcinoma, small foci;  fibroadipose tissue and skeletal muscle with reactive changes.
We intubated him in preparation for a CT-scan to rule out a hemorrhage given the fall given a very poor airway given the history of the adenoCA with subsequent surgeries.
CT showed a SAH, and the MRI showed L parietal contusion, evidence of subarchnoid blood seen on CT, as well as a small subdural hemorrhage bifrontally.
Repeat CT scans of the head were stable without evidence of hemmorhage progression.
Trauma and Ortho surgery were consulted for possible CTL-spine fractures from the fall.
After dedicated films and clinical exam, it was decided that no fractures ensued, and c-collar was dc'd and patient was again allowed to have full body movement.
Chronic pain was also consulted to help manage his home pain regimen, especially when a final diagnosis of metastatic cancer came back on path.
Patient was to f/u next week with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] as well as have a fitting for his prosthesis on monday and a later f/u with neurology and possibly chronic pain.
please take new meds as directed Please call your surgeon if you have any of the following: -fever >101 -difficulty breathing, speaking or swallowing -worsening abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting -persistent diarrhea or constipation   Followup Instructions: Please follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] in 1 week.
