The patient had multiple metastases so gastrectomy was not performed.
He required increasing amounts of oxygen until finally he became unresponsive and hypotensive.
He required levo for hypotension.
Chest x-ray showed a right infiltrate.
Over the next few days he continued to have shortness of breath.
He developed tachycardia up to 120-130.
His chest x-ray was unremarkable except for a suspicious opacification in the left lobe which was considered to be a possible pneumonia.
He was also started on Lopressor and then Diltiazem drip for tachycardia control.
On postoperative day number six, the patient was started on a combination of oral and IV Lopresor which seemed to control his tachycardia much better.
There was a suspicion of aspiration so a video swallow study was performed which showed the patient aspirates some air when using a straw, however, can drink normally from a cup without any aspiration.
His shortness of breath has improved.
No active issues at this time.
Prostatic CA, status post exploratory laparotomy, omental biopsy, liver biopsy.
