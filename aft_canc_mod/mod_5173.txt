CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2141-11-10**] 4:59 PM FINDINGS: There are numerous foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage including in the left superior frontal lobe, bilateral medial frontal and parietal lobes, left and right frontal lobes in the sylvian fissures, and left parietal lobe.
There is subdural hematoma overlying the left frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes that tracks into the left middle cranial fossa with maximal thickness of 6 mm overlying the left temporal lobe anteriorly.
There is a parafalcine subdural hematoma with maximal thickness of approximately 4 mm.
There is no significant left to right midline shift.
There is encephalomalacia in the right anterior frontal lobe, right parietal lobe, and right occipital lobe consistent with previous infarction.
Additionally, a linear focus of hyperdensity consistent with hemorrhage is also seen projecting at the right temporal lobe (series 2, image 10), the location of which is not entirely certain.
There is no definite intraventricular hemorrhage.
There is no hydrocephalus.
There is diffuse prominence of the ventricles and sulci consistent with volume loss.
There is periventricular white matter hypodensity consistent with chronic small vessel infarction.
There are atherosclerotic calcifications of both vertebral arteries and internal carotid arteries.
Numerous foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage as described above.
Left subdural hematoma with a maximal thickness of approximately 6 mm, without significant mass effect.
Parafalcine subdural hematoma.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2141-11-11**] 8:20 AM Again seen are multiple areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage interdigitating within the sulci of the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes.
Bifrontal and parafalcine subdural hemorrhages are again noted.
There is no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
Chronic infarcts in the right frontoparietal and occipital lobes are again noted.
IMPRESSION: Stable subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhages as described above.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2141-11-16**] 9:13 AM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: Please assess for infiltrate  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: [**Age over 90 **] year old man with GI bleed with fever, RLL crackles.
please assess for infiltrate.
The lung fields are clear without any consolidations, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] yo man with a history of CAD/CABG on aspirin/plavix pw GIB likely secondary to NSAID use, s/p mechanical fall with head [**Last Name (un) **] resulting in both subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
No further episodes of BRBPR during bowel prep.
UGI revealed antral gastritis that could be consistent with NSAID induced gastritis.
Subdural hematoma/subarachnoid hemorrhage- No neurological impairment noted by exam.
Patient's clopidogrel was stopped in the setting of GIB and intracranial hemorrhage as there was no clear indication for dual antiplatelet therapy.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: NSAID induced gastritis Upper gastrointestinal bleeding Subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after a fall at home relating to bleeding for upper intestinal gastritis.
You were found to have some bleeding around your brain after hitting your head.
