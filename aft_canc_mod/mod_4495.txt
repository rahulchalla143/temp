Past Medical History: Treatment History (per OMR): Mr. [**Known lastname 8952**] initially noticed bleeding from a skin lesion on his left upper arm in late [**2153-8-31**].
He was subsequently evaluated and ultimately had a punch biopsy performed in early [**Month (only) **], which showed invasive malignant melanoma.
In the sentinel lymph node, a cluster of MART-1 positive cells were noted and thought to be consistent with micrometastases.
On [**2154-1-17**] he underwent a left axillary dissection, and all 17 lymph nodes removed and evaluated were free of disease.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 97.4  BP: 136/89  P: 99  R: 28 O2:  94% 3 L General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress, lying flat post cath HEENT: [**Last Name (LF) 3899**], [**First Name3 (LF) 13775**], Sclera anicteric, dry MM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally on atnerior exam (limited to post cath supine position), no wheezes, rales, rhonchi CV: tachycardic, regular rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, distended, hypoactive BS, tender in RUQ and LUQ to moderate palpation, no rebound tenderness or guarding GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema .
New predominantly perihepatic hemorrhage likely arising from a segment VII liver lesion.
New moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
[**2155-7-23**]   Cardiology ECHO IMPRESSION: Small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of hemodynamic compromise.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified  [**2155-7-25**]   Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP) IMPRESSION: 1.
Low lung volumes.
Moderate right subpulmonic effusion.
Bibasilar atelectasis at the lung bases.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 8952**] is a 44 YOM with metastatic melanoma to liver and lungs who presented for IL-2 therapy .
# Liver metasteses bleed: On treatment day #8 of IL-2 the patient was noted to have a Hct drop from 33.9 to 20.
LFTs were also elevated acutely.
BP was 130-140, but tachycardic to 100-120.
CT torso revealed active hemorrhage from one of multiple liver lesions.
He underwent Angio of celiac and hepatic arteries.
No active bleeding was seen and the tumors were actually hypovascular, but some superior vessels of the right hepatic artery were embolized with gelfoam as this was sight of most substantial bleeding on recent noncon CT.
There were no complications.
His pain continued to improve on the floor, though he still required pain medication at time of discharge.
# Metastatic melanoma:  The patient finished IL-2 on [**2155-7-18**].
# Myocarditis: The patient was found to have elevated CK, troponin, and CKMB consistent with IL-2 induced myocarditis.
He was monitored on telemetry and was found to have a few short runs of NSVT.
Has small oxygen requirement at time of discharge.
Given recent IL-2/volume overload/recent embolization and minimal O2 requirement did not perform tap at this time.
#Volume overload: TTE performed revealed Small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of hemodynamic compromise.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Home oxygen 1-3L continuous pulse dosed for portability   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic melanoma - s/p C1W1 HD IL-2 therapy Hemorrhagic hepatic metastases s/p embolization Myocarditis pleural effusion   Discharge Condition: Alert, oriented and ambulatory 88% ambulatory room air   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for IL-2 therapy.
Your hospitalization was complicated by a hemorrhage of a liver lesion, which required embolization.
You also have fluid overload.
