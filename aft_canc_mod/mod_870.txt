Admission Date:  [**2113-8-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2113-9-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-5-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Bactrim  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3043**] Chief Complaint: fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardial window and chest tube placement-[**2113-9-1**]   History of Present Illness: 46 year old man with advanced AIDS with CD4 count of 1 and viral load of 30,000 on HARRT (Darunavir/Etravirine/Truvada and Raltegravir) through a clinical trial who presented to OSH with shortness of breath, chest pain, and fever.
Patient reports that 2 days PTA, he began having chest pain that he describes as a very heavy person sitting on his chest, it did not radiate, was worse when he leaned forward or took a deep breath, better when laying back and was accompanied by mild SOB.
He took ASA and Celebrex (that a friend gave him) and the pain got better.
His pain worsened w/ fevers to the low 101 one day PTA.
He was found to have a mild elevation of troponins, negative d-dimer.
His EKG showed PR depression in the inferior leads.
An echo which revealed pericardial effusion.
He has no history of coronary artery disease and was diagnosed with "pericarditits".
He continued to have symptoms and his TTE showed rapidly increasing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
Patient states that his breathing improved markedly post procedure.
However overnight he was found to be hypoxic with new oxygen requirement (c/t post window status) to 4LNC.
His pleuritic chest pain worsened however still markedly better than his admission pain.
Seasonal allergies.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal systolic function.
Small pericardial effusion with no evidence of tamponade  [**2113-9-1**] TTE Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
There is a moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion.
There is brief right ventricular diastolic invagination consistent with elevated intrapericardial pressure, low right-sided filling pressures, or both.
IMPRESSION: Moderate sized pericardial effusion with evidence of elevated intrapericardial pressures.

Pericardial fluid drained surgically with resolution of tmaponade physiology.
Small size left sided pleural effusion  [**2113-9-3**] TTE There is a small pericardial effusion appears somewhat echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
[**2113-9-5**] TTE Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is abnormal septal motion suggestive of pericardial constriction.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
There is a small pericardial effusion with echodense elements in the pericardial space consistent with organization and probable adhesion/pericardial constriction.
CT Head IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: There is moderate mucosal thickening involving the anterior ethmoidal air cells, bilaterally, and limited included left maxillary sinus, which appears new (though bone algorithm reconstructions were not performed, previously).
The remaining included paranasal sinuses, as well as the mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities are clear, as above.
Right interpolar hypoechoic focus, while likely represents a prominent renal pyramid, cannot exclude a small focus of pyelonephritis.
Gallbladder wall edema, with pericholecystic fluid, but no gallbladder wall distention.
Unlikely to represent acute cholecystitis.
Likely secondary to IV hydration or low oncotic pressure.
Three left and one right lobe hepatic hemangioma as described above.
No pulmonary embolism to segmental level, although determination of the distal pulmonary arteries is not possible due to inadequate contrast opacification and respiratory motion artifact.V/Q scan may be useful if clinically indicated 2.
No dissection or aortic aneurysm.
Large pericardial effusion 4.
Small-to-moderate bibasilar pleural effusions with probable loculated effusion in the right lung base.
Small pulmonary nodules with the soft tissue in a periaortic and peribronchovascular distribution raises the possibility of Kaposi's sarcoma, correlation with presence of cutaneous lesions is recommended.
Bibasilar and retrocardiac atelectasis in the left lower lobe.

There is no hydronephrosis.
A right renal pyramid with the questionable appearance on the prior ultrasound is less prominent on today's exam and does appear consistent with the pyramid.
The kidneys are slightly echogenic bilaterally.
There is no cyst or stone or solid mass identified.
The pre-void bladder is only partially distended, but is otherwise unremarkable.

On admission he had chest pain and EKG changes consistent w/ pericarditis.
He as initially treated w/ NSAIDs for pain control.
TTE was done which showed a small pericardial effusion.
On HD 3 he developed cardiac tamponade and was taken to the OR for an emergent pericardial window.
He had no more issues w/ chest pain after the pericardial window.
# Low grade fevers: After his pericardial window was placed (and while on vancomycin), he continued to have low-grade fevers, the etiology of which was not determined.
A thorough workup, with the notable exception of a CT abd/pelvis with contrast (given acute renal failure), was performed.
# Sinus tachycardia and hypoxia:  On post-op day 2 patient developed sinus tachycardia to 140s and hypoxia sats to high 80s.
This was thought to be due to a combination of fluid overhydration causing pleural effusion and infectious process.
No evidence of end organ ischemia currently.
Not thought to be haveing significant reaccumilation of pericardial fluid as pt had TTE that showed small pericardial effusion.
# Pulmonary nodule:  Patient was found to have a small pulmonary nodules with the soft tissue in a periaortic and peribronchovascular distribution raised the possibility of Kaposi's sarcoma.
Pt also had well-circumscribed mass in right posterior lung base at periphery.
He had no overt source of bleed and remained asymtomatic throughout admission.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 8300**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: MRSA Pericarditis Acute Renal Failure Persistent Fevers  Secondary Diagnosis HIV/AIDS   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital with chest pain, difficulty breathing, and spiking fevers on [**8-30**].
You were diagnosed with MRSA pericarditis that resulted in a large percardial effusion requiring surgical drainage.
The chest tube was subseuqently removed and your chest pain and shortness of breath have improved significantly over the course of your stay.
You also developed acute renal failure during the hospital stay that we believe to be related to poor perfusion in the setting of cardiac tamponade (constriction of the heart in the setting of a large pericardial effusion).
Hydration and renal dosing of your medication have improved your renal function and urine output; however, you may have a new baseline in terms of your renal function.
In addition, you have had spiking fevers at night throughout the hospital stay.
If you develop chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, reduced urine output, high fevers, shaking chills or any other concerning symptoms, please go to your nearest emergency room.
Followup Instructions: PLEASE ENSURE THAT LOCULATED PLEURAL EFFUSION SEEN ON CT SCAN IS FOLLOWED UP UPON DISCHARGE  Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) 1423**] [**Name11 (NameIs) **], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 457**] Date/Time:[**2113-9-21**] 10:00  Provider: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 1877**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1878**], M.D.
