Admission Date:  [**2122-1-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-1-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-11-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**] Chief Complaint: Right leg pain and swelling  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Temporary IVC filter placement Esophagogastroduodenoscopy colonoscopy   History of Present Illness: 54 y.o.
male with PMHx of ESRD (thought to be [**3-14**] HTN) s/p deceased donor kidney transplant in [**2111**], HTN and gout who presented to the ER with right leg swelling and pain x 3 days.
He denies any recent injury or prolonged travel and has not had problems with leg swelling in the past.
He additionally denies SOB or CP.
In the ED, patient was evaluated and noted to have a tender, erythematous right LE with a right calf measuring 43cm compared to 38 cm of the left calf.
Bilateral LE dopplers were performed and showed a DVT in the right common femoral to the calf veins.
Given his kidney disease, renal transplant was consulted in the ED and felt there were no active transplant issues.
Patient was noted to be guaiac positive and does have a history of a colonic polyp, found in [**2119**].
Past Medical History: ESRD ?
[**3-14**] HTN s/p deceased donor renal transplant in [**2111**] Gout HTN Impaired glucose tolerance Hyperlipidemia   Social History: Born in [**Country 6257**], moved to US in [**2091**] at about age 23.
He had worked in electronics but is now on disability.
There is no history of diabetes or cancer in the family.
No hemmorhoids seen.
Ext: LE asymmetry, R>L with erythema and 1+ pitting edema in RLE.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale, color, Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right and left common femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal veins were performed.
There is deep vein thrombosis extending from the right common femoral vein to the calf veins.
There is no deep vein thrombosis within the left lower extremity.
There is no hydronephrosis or renal calculi.
The bladder is well distended without abnormality.
No evidence of PE .
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 54 year old male s/p renal transplant for ESRD ([**2111**]) without any identified risk factors for deep venous thrombosis.
He presented to the hospital with right lower extremity swelling and tenderness for 3 days.
DVT: Patient had no clear risk factors for DVT and no prior history of DVTs.
Because of the size of the thrombus and the clinically significant threat of pulmonary embolus, an IVC filter was placed by interventional radiology on [**2122-1-7**].
No contast was used for placement because of patient's renal insufficiency and it was placed via ultrasound guidance.
Patient was continued on heparin until [**2122-1-13**] when he passed a grossly bloody stool in the morning.
With this HCT drop, hemodynamic change, gross blood in his stool, and a single access point for fluids, it was decided that patient would be better served in a monitored setting so he was transferred to the intensive care unit.
Hypercoaguable workup so far has showed increased B2 microglobulin which is nonspecific and frequently elevated in patient's with chronic renal insufficiency.
His protein C level was elevated while protein S was within the normal range.
Extensive discussion took place between the primary medical team, primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] team, and interventional radiology team regarding removal of the patient's IVC filter, as it was initially placed as a temporary filter.
He was then transferred to the [**Year (4 digits) **] to receive 24 hours of local TPA via a central line that was placed in IR.
He was encouraged to elevated his leg when possible and wore [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] stocking to help with the edema.
Guaiac Positive Stool: Patient was noted to have guaiac positive stool in the emergency room.
A colonoscopy completed in [**2119**] showed a nonbleeding polyp/adenoma.
Upper and lower endoscopy on [**2122-1-8**] demonstrated an EG juntion ulcer which was biopsied, as well as three non-bleeding polyps in colon that were removed.
These are a possible source of the initial guaiac positive result.
Patient passed a grossly bloody stool on [**1-13**] and became hemodynamically unstable at that time.
He had no further episodes of bleeding and his HCT remained stable.
It was felt the bleeding was from the biospy/polyp removal sites which resolved with time.
3 ESRD s/p transplant: Patient was continued on his immunosuppression regime and maintained a stable creatinine throughout his hospitalization, at this baseline of 1.7-2.0.
4 HTN - Patient's lopressor and enalapril home medications were discontinued initially at time of admission.
If indicated, his hydralazine and vasotec should be re-introduced as an outpatient.. .
The pain was similar to previous flare.
If not previously completed, the patient may benefit from a dianostic tap of a joint in the event of future gout flares to avoid higher doses of prednisone if his joint pain is not in fact gout.
At time of discharge, he was on tylenol 1000mg TID for left foot pain felt to be secondary to bumping his foot into his IV pole; the pain responded well to tylenol.
Tachycardia: Patient initially had significat tachycardia to the 140s while ambulating or exerting himself once he came out of the intensive care unit.
It was felt that his tachycardia was secondary to a volume depleted state as he had been NPO; it was also likely that he had significantly decreased venous return with the large right DVT.
To ensure that he did not have a pulmonary embolus that was contributing to the tachycardia, a V/Q scan was completed which was normal.
His tachycardia resolved during his stay prior to discharge.
He had a mid-line placed during his stay due to access difficulties.
Discharge: Patient was ambulating without difficulty or pain and his INR was therapeutic at time of discharge.
Colchicine 0.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Pain.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Right leg deep vein thrombosis lower GI bleeding .
Secondary diagnoses: - Esophogeal ulcer - Colonic polyps (removed) - ESRD s/p deceased donor renal transplant in [**2111**] - Gout - HTN - Impaired glucose tolerance - Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Stable, ambulating without difficulty.
Vital signs stable.
You also underwent a colonoscopy and experienced some bleeding which resolved.
