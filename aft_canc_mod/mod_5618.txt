Admission Date:  [**2199-8-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**2199-8-11**]  Date of Birth:   [**2122-10-7**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Location (un) 259**] MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, and diabetes, who was doing well until two days prior to admission when he began to feel weak.
The patient reported nausea on the morning of admission which had resolved by the time he had been to the Emergency Room.
He denied back pain and abdominal pain at the time of admission.
He also denied diarrhea or constipation.
Patient was somewhat diaphoretic.
A nasogastric lavage returned evidence of blood and MICU evaluation was consulted, and the patient was admitted to the MICU.
Denied viral symptoms.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction x2 with anginal equivalent of jaw pain or back pain.
Diabetes type 2.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of [**8-31**] with 30-40%.
Guaiac positive stools on aspirin.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Urinary retention.
In general, this was an elderly male, who is pale in no acute distress.
Pale conjunctivae, but no icterus.
Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, 2/4 systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border, no radiation.
Lungs with crackles at the bases bilaterally.
Abdominal examination:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, good bowel sounds, and no palpable masses.
Extremities revealed trace lower extremity edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Revealed normal sinus rhythm, normal intervals, T-wave inversions which were old in aVL, V5, and V6, and poor R-wave progression.
He had slight ST depressions 1 mm as well.
This was negative for aortic dissection or aortoenteric fistula.
Anemia:  The anemia was felt likely to be secondary to an acute on chronic picture.
Chronic being anemia of chronic disease and in a setting of acute exacerbation namely a GI bleed.
In addition, it was also considered that there maybe another source of his anemia given the fact that the patient also had thrombocytopenia.
The patient had no evidence of active hemolysis or DIC.
A bone marrow biopsy was performed on the patient which revealed myelodysplastic syndrome.
It was believed that the myelodysplastic syndrome accounted for portions of both the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia.
The patient was found to have MDS on bone marrow biopsy with a question of MDS and ITP.
GI bleed:  Patient was found to have an active GI bleed with a positive nasogastric tube lavage.
Once the patient's hematocrit and platelet counts were stable, he underwent an endoscopy to evaluate his upper GI bleed.
The patient was found to have a significant amount of gastritis and also duodenitis.
On the day after the endoscopy, the patient returned to the Endoscopy Suite for re-evaluation if the patient had decreased his hematocrit overnight, however, there were no further sites of active bleeding found.
Colonoscopy was considered while in-house, however, it was deemed that the sight of GI bleeding in the stomach and duodenum was sufficient to account for the patient's blood loss.
It was deemed that the GI bleeding was under control at this time of discharge with a negative endoscope and also stable hematocrit.
Although the patient's proton-pump inhibitor had originally been held, it was started prior to discharge with an alternate diagnosis for thrombocytopenia had been found.
Cardiac:  Patient has an extensive cardiac history.
An electrocardiogram obtained at that time revealed ST segment depressions to 3 mm which has increased over the baseline of 1 mm for this patient.
The patient was given sublingual nitroglycerin with relief of back pain and also the ST segment depressions.
Serial enzymes were also checked at that time, and the patient ruled in for myocardial infarction.
Given the fact that the electrocardiogram changes had resolved, and the patient was asymptomatic after sublingual nitroglycerin, it was deemed that this was due to demand ischemia given the patient's low hematocrit at the time.
Congestive heart failure:  Patient with a history of congestive heart failure and mild volume overload on examination on admission.
The patient's medications for hypertension were re-evaluated and medication changes made as needed, for instance decreased dosage of the beta blocker.
The patient was given Lasix IV, and after blood transfusion was given 20 mg IV to avoid further congestive heart failure exacerbation.
A chest x-ray was obtained two days prior to discharge, which showed no evidence of congestive heart failure.
Diabetes mellitus:  The patient's oral medications were originally held as the patient was NPO for procedure for his GI bleeding.
Chronic renal insufficiency:  Patient's creatinine was slightly increased on admission with a creatinine of 2.0 throughout his admission.
The original 2.0 was likely secondary to hypovolemia.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  The patient was not on any medications for this.
He required no treatment.
There was no nausea and no vomiting while in-house.
The patient had reported a large black stool prior to his endoscopy.
Patient with upper GI bleed now under control.
Patient with stable hematocrit and platelet count over 48 hours prior to discharge.
Patient with new diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome on high-dosed steroids for this.
Myelodysplastic syndrome.
Coronary artery disease.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Coronary artery disease/myocardial ischemia.
Congestive heart failure.
The patient was also instructed to have his blood counts followed within the next week.
Patient will also arrange with his primary care doctor for his GI bleeding and also possibility of further explorations such as colonoscopy.
