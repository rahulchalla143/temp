Left hilar mass invading the right main bronchus just proximal to the upper lobe orifice, surrounds and invades the left lower lobe and lingular bronchi and surrounds the mid left descending pulmonary artery, extending medially along the left superior pulmonary vein.
No evidence of mediastinal invasion.
New 4-mm upper lobe nodule is suspicious for metastasis.
[**2165-12-17**] Chest Xray: Since the prior radiograph, a large infrahilar mass has developed in the left lung.
This is associated with inferior displacement of the left hilum and apparent obstruction of the airways with distal mucoid impaction.
Peripheral to this area in the region of the lingula, there is a large 6.2 cm diameter opacity that could be due to additional mass or area of post-obstructive atelectasis.
Post-thoracotomy changes are again demonstrated in the right hemithorax, and there is either a small right pleural effusion or pleural thickening present.
On [**2165-12-17**], chest xray was obtained, showing a large infrahilar mass that developed in the left lung along with a large opacity peripherally that could be due to additional mass or area of post-obstructive atelectasis.
Subsequent chest CT was obtained, confirming a left hilar mass invading the left main stem bronchus.
Flexible bronchoscopy revealed a viable stump in the bronchus intermedius with distal left main stem endobronchial lesion causing significant airway compromise (75% occlusion) and tumor infiltration in the left upper lobe.
Postop, he had episode of stridor and was given racemic epinephrine and oxygen with improvement.
On [**2165-12-18**], patient went back to the OR for a rigid bronchoscopy with black Dumon bronchoscope and did therapeutic aspiration of secretions along with tumor debridement using Argon plasma coagulation with successful recanalization of the distal left main stem and left upper lobe.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for anxiety.
