He suffered bilateral subdural hematomas and extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage, and a left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema.
He had an evacuation of a right subdural hematoma on [**2125-10-2**], and developed respiratory distress, required intubation, tracheostomy, and eventually PEG placement.
At that time, an MRI revealed a new infarct around his right hemisphere and his left white matter, which caused him to have left hemiparesis.
He also developed MRSA pneumonia while hospitalized, and atrial fibrillation.
Prior to discharge, he was found to be awake, alert and following simple commands with decreased attention on the left side and left hemiparesis.
On [**10-29**], while at his rehab facility, he was found to be lethargic and arousable with only deep stimulation.
He had a head CT on [**10-30**] showing an increased subdural on the left side and was brought to the Emergency Room with a fever of 103.8, and had a repeat head CT on arrival which showed increased interval change of a chronic left subdural, now with midline shift and mass effect.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  CAD, status post MI in 09/[**2124**].
Peripheral vascular disease.
Squamous cell skin cancer, status post XRT.
Atrial fibrillation which occurred during his hospitalization.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
CARDIAC:  He was tachycardic at 103 without a murmur, S1, S2.
EXTREMITIES:  He had a left scabbed area over his Achilles tendon.
Withdrew his bilateral lower extremities.
He had slight withdrawal of his left upper extremity, which was baseline for him.
Did not appear to follow commands, though did somewhat better with his family.
He had a chest x-ray which did not show any pneumonia at that time.
He received a packed red blood cell transfusion and volume resuscitation.
Postoperatively, he was moving his bilateral lower extremities spontaneously.
Postoperatively, his head CT essentially showed little change of the blood evacuation on the left side, though he seemed to be somewhat more responsive neurologically postop.
His first blood cultures came back gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains.
He developed a rash on [**2125-11-1**], which a dermatology consult was obtained.
He had multiple nonfollicular based erythematous papules on the left side of his trunk, which was felt to be miliaria crystallina which was thought to be acquired from the blockage of sweat ducts.
Infectious disease was consulted on [**11-5**], as his blood cultures showed Enterococcus in his blood, which was VRE 4/4 bottles, with 2 speciated as enterococcus, [**1-28**] with MRSA.
On [**11-5**], they also recommended that Mr. [**Known lastname 3805**] [**Last Name (Titles) 19806**] a TTE to rule out endocarditis, an ultrasound of his PEG to rule out fluid collection, and an ultrasound of his right IJ to rule out any hematoma.
Ultrasound of his upper extremity showed no right internal jugular vein clot detected.
Echo results indicated a moderate risk for endocarditis, and they recommended prophylaxis, and he will be treated with linezolid for 6 weeks.
His blood cultures on [**2125-11-6**] were final for no growth.
On [**11-10**], he was noted to have some left shoulder weakness.
He was seen by orthopedics who evaluated the patient, obtained an AP and lateral shoulder film which showed no acute fracture or dislocation, and recommended some physical therapy.
Mr. [**Known lastname 3805**] was noted to have skin breakdown over his coccyx area for which he has been having a DuoDerm placed.
He also is currently at this recording receiving a podiatry consult for left Achilles tendon erythema and eschar.
A repeat head CT was done prior to discharge and felt that his left-sided subdural hematoma had much improved and was close to resolving.
11.Protonix 40 mg IV q 24 h.  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Acute on chronic left subdural hematoma, now resolving.
Positive vancomycin resistant enterococcus and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus blood cultures.
Atrial fibrillation.
Previous cerebrovascular accident.
Squamous cell skin cancer.
