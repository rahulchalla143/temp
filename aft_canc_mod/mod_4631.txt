He was diagnosed with LLL pneumonia, left pleural effusion, and small nodule in the RLL.
He completed 5 days of therapy, but then developed cough, worsening sputum production, and increasing dyspnea.
He had a repeat CT scan of the chest which confirmed dramatic progression of disease when compared to prior CT scan of [**5-29**].
There was a large loculated pleural effusion on the left c/w possible empyema.
There is extensive atelectasis in the residual left lung apex where there are cavitary or emphysematous changes.
There are diffuse infiltrates throughout the R lung and small R pleural effusion, ascites, cirrhosis, and enlarged spleen.
On the floor, patient reports that he is mildly uncomfortable with breathing.
Reports cough with greenish phlegm.
Also reports 8 lb weight loss in 1 mo.

Right side with more air movement, but intermittent rhonchi and decreased BS at base.

These findings are highly concerning for a combination of large pleural effusion and atelectasis giving the absence of the right mediastinal shift.
Central obstruction with significant atelectasis are suspected.
On the right, there is small amount of pleural effusion, partially imaged and potentially loculated (note is made that the right costophrenic angle was not included in the field of view).
In addition, there is right lower lobe opacity as well as vascular prominence and questionable right upper lobe opacities.
Although the vascular engorgement may be physiologic, reflecting the constriction of the vascularity in the left hemithorax, it can represent volume overload  CT CHEST W/ CONTRAST IMPRESSION:  1.
Moderate residual hydropneumothorax with split pleura sign suggesting empyema, which could be confirmed by examination of pleural fluid characteristics.
Left apical cavitary lesion with an intraluminal rounded opacity suggests mycetoma or semi-invasive aspergillus.
Complete collapse of the left lower lobe bronchus and expanded left lower lobe with low attenuation suggests drowned lung.
Right lower lobe consolidative peribronchobronchovascular mass with vascular attenuation and associated right hilar adenopathy concerning for neoplasm or aggressive fungal infection.
Otherwise, CT follow up after treatment of acute symptoms is recommended.
Multiple lytic bone lesions in the sternum, scapula and vertebral bodies may represent multiple myeloma versus metastatic disease.
Diffuse ground-glass opacity in the bilateral upper lobes could be related to multifocal infection or aspiration.
Small nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion and pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 53yo male with COPD and EtOH cirrhosis presenting with worsening SOB and loculated pleural effusion concerning for empyema from OSH.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: On presentation patient's respiratory distress appeared to be related to the OSH diagnosed pneumonia and likely parapneumonic effusion or empyema.
CXR showed nearly complete white-out of the L lung and OSH CT chest showed large loculated pleural effusion on the left with extensive atelectasis in the residual left lung apex, and occluded left mainstem bronchus.
He was started on vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl as he has not improved with levofloxacin monotherapy from OSH and considered he may have anaerobic infection.
The patients COPD seemed to play a minimal role in his respiratory distress.
There was no evidence of chronic CO2 retention per review of ABG or chemistry.
And patient showed symptomatic improvement.
Cytology revealed very abnormal cells concerning for malignancy but cell block was required for definite diagnosis.
He also had a CT Chest which showed RLL consolidative mass with right hilar adenopathy concerning for neoplasm, a consolidation of the LLL with complete collapse of the LLL bronchus, and multiple lytic bone lesions in the sternum, scapula and vertebral bodies which suggested a metastatic process.
On HD2 patient became tachypnic and tachycardic and required intubation.
The family was informed of the high likelihood the patient had metastatic lung cancer and the dismal prognosis.
On HD4 patient was noted to have cyanotic right foot, bleeding from IV sites and lab work consistent with a diagnosis of DIC.
