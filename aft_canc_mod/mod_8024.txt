Admission Date:  [**2164-9-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-10-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2113-10-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**] Chief Complaint: difficulty with speech  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy with biopsy   History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 91275**] is a 50 year-old male with PMHx of L-sided facial numbness in [**Month (only) 1096**] and [**Month (only) 958**], diverticulitis, allergic rhinitis and TB treated with 9 months of INH in his 20's who presented as a stroke code for aphasia and R-sided weakness.
Patient was at home on the DOA [**Location (un) 1131**] a book when he noticed difficulty understanding the words on the page as well as difficulty holding the book with his right hand.
His symptoms were unwitnessed by others and he decided not to go to the ED at that time.
Later that day however, he noted difficulty with painting and could only paint broad strokes with his brush but was unable to make fine movements.
He was taken to the ED and while in the parking lot the patient felt his comprehension return however he continued to have an expressive aphasia.
He was also found to have a right facial droop and was unable to lift his R arm.
He continued to have weakness in his distal RUE.
tPA was not given because he was out of the window of treatment and his symptoms were rapidly improving on their own.
His MRI returned with strokes on both sides of his brain (L MCA territory and small lesions in the R cerebellum and R parietal lobes) presumed to be from a cardioembolic source.
During workup of his presenting symptoms, the patient was found to have multiple miliary appearing lesions on chest x-ray.
Of note, the patient reports a history of chronic cough over the past 4 months.
He was started on inhaled steroids (Symbacort) about 1 month ago for the cough for presumed allergies but stopped ~1 week ago after developing hoarseness in his voice and worsening cough.
Patient also notes persistent shortness of breath that started 1-2 weeks prior to admission without change in position.
Patient denies any recent subjective fever, chills, night sweats, rash or change in weight.
He still complains of residual right hand weakness, but denies headache, meningismus, or visual changes.
During the admission, he has remained hemodynamically stable with SBP in the low 100's and HR in the 50-60's.
for mild R facial droop,mild R distal upper extremity weakness, some decreased sensation on the RUE and some mild expressive aphasia.
During this admission, he was found to have bilateral DVTs and a possible PFO note on TTE, for which he was continued on heparin gtt.

No aphasia or paraphasic errors were appreciated during the exam.
CNs II-XII intact except for anicosuria (see HEENT), ROM limited most in R index finger.
There are diffuse reticulonodular opacities throughout both lungs.
In the setting of fever, findings could be due to a diffuse atypical infection.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
Patchy areas of hypodensity are noted in the left frontal lobe and the left insula.
There is increased mean transit time in the left frontal, anterior parietal and temporal lobes with decreased blood volume and flow in these areas.
This is suggestive of acute infarct in left middle cerebral artery territory.
The area of increased mean transit time is more than area of decreased blood flow and blood volume suggestive of mismatch.
No evidence of focal flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm in arteries of head and neck.
There is paucity of the cortical branches of the left middle cerebral artery.
Innumerable small nodules in bilateral visualized lung fields.
Enlarged necrotic lymph nodes in the neck and superior mediastinum.
This requires further evaluation with dedicated imaging.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is somewhat delayed (beat [**3-20**]) appearance of microbubbles in the left heart c/w PFO or transpulmonic passage.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
Possible patent foramen ovale vs. small pulmonary AVM.
If clinically indicated, a TEE with saline contrast and maneuvers is suggested to better define the interatrial septum.
Restricted diffusion in the left frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes and insula that is suggestive of acute infarct in the middle cerebral artery territory.
Punctate areas of high signal intensity are noted on diffusion weighted images in right parietal lobe and right cerebellum, which likely represent acute embolic infarcts.
No evidence of focal flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm greater than 3 mm in the arteries of head and neck.
BILAT LENIS [**2164-10-1**]: IMPRESSION: DVT in a single tributary of the left posterior tibial and both tributaries of the right peroneal veins.
CT CHEST [**2164-10-1**]: IMPRESSION: Innumerable, randomly distributed small and medium-sized pulmonary nodulesm, necrotic mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, a more discrete left suprahilar lesion, likely part of left hilar lymphadenopathy or primary lung malignancy, smooth interlobular septal thickening and indeterminate heterogeneously hypodense liver lesion.
Metastatic disease to lung, mediastinum and liver.
In absence of known primary elsewhere, left suprahilar lesion is concerning of a primary lung malignancy.
(this pattern of lung metastasis can be seen with thyroid, pancreatic and renal malignancies).
Though this patter of pulmonary involvement can be seen in Sarcoid, necrotic mediastinal lymph nodes and cavitation demonstrated in some of the nodules is very unlikely for Sarcoid disease.
Lymphoma (less likely).
Micronodular pulmonary disease was characterized in prior CT of thorax the day prior to this exam and might represent granulomatous disease of infectious or idiopathic etiology, miliary metastatic disease or less likely lymphoma.
This might represent a necrotic neoplasm or metastatic disease.
Differentioal diagnosis includes atypical hemangioma although this is considered unlikely.
Multiple splenic infarcts and a right kidney infarct are concerning for embolic process.
Small cysts in the kidneys are too small to characterize but likely represent simple cysts.
Cytology:  POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS,   consistent with adenocarcinoma  MICROBIOLOGY:  Urine Culture [**2164-9-30**]: No growth RPR [**2164-9-30**]: Negative HIV Ab [**2164-10-1**]: Negative MRSA screen [**2164-10-1**]: Negative AFB smear x 3 ([**Date range (3) 91276**]): No AFB's HAV Ab: Positive HBsAg: Negative HBsAb: Negative HBcAb: Negative HCV Ab: Negative    Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 91275**] is a 50 y/o R-handed man with PMHx of tuberculosis, diverticulitis, and 2 episodes of L facial numbness who presented with a L MCA stroke with some R-sided DWI abnormalities suggestive of a cardioembolic stroke source.
His exam was significant for mild R facial droop, mild aphasia (difficulty with production but not comprehension of speech) and mild RUE weakness.
His hospital course was complicated by a suspicion for reactivated TB given a CXR and CT chest that showed multiple fine nodules, as well as a an incidentally noted liver lesion of unclear [**Name2 (NI) 68402**], bilateral DVTs and splenic and kidney infarcts, with a final diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.
ACTIVE ISSUES:  # L MCA stroke: Mr. [**Known lastname 91275**] suffered a L MCA stroke with small lesions in the R cerebellum and R parietal lobes, with residual R facial drop, RUE weakness, and mild aphasia.
His MRI showed a smaller deficit than would have been expected based on his CT during the code stroke, which suggests he was already partially clearing one of his clots shortly after onset of symptoms.
On discharge, he had residual neurological deficits in his R upper extremity and mild expressive aphasia.
# Adenocarcinoma: Mr. [**Known lastname 91275**] complained of dyspnea for the past 1-2 weeks and cough productive of clear sputum for the past 4 months, without hemoptysis.
Notably, pt had diffuse hazy opacities in bilateral lung fields on CXR and CT chest.
We orderd a number of tests to rule out malignancy and infection.
The next day cytology returned positve for adenocarcinoma of uncertain primary site.
# Hoarseness: Pt developed hoarseness in his voice about 1 week prior to admission, associated with worsening of his cough.
He had anisocoria, presumably new, but no other symptoms of Horner's.
We were concerned for compression of his recurrent laryngeal nerve, most likely his oncologic process.
# Liver mass: A liver lesion of unclear significance was found on CT scan.
We were concerned for primary neoplasm or metastasis, infection, or an atypical hemangioma.
# Renal & splenic infarction: Infarctions of the b/l kidneys and spleen were found on CT abd/pelvis.
These most likely represented septic emboli in the setting of malignancy and possible PFO.
# Bilateral DVT: LENIs were positive for R peroneal and L posterior tibial DVTs on this admission.
These DVT's most likely developed in the setting of a malignant hypercoaguable process.
# Possible PFO: A TTE showed possible PFO on this admission, which could be significant in the setting of stroke and renal and splenic infarctions.
Pt will need a TEE performed as an outpt  TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES: - Patient will need outpatient follow-up with neurology for stroke follow-up.
-Pt will follow up with oncology for further work-up of his adenocarcinoma  -Pt will need a TEE as an outpt to further work up his possible PFO  - Patient was full code on this admission.

During this hospitalization, we diagnosed you with a kind of cancer called adenocarcinoma.
For example, it could be a type of lung cancer or from another organ.
We also cannot tell if there are metastases.
However, we do know that your symptoms are not because of infections.
You do not have tuberculosis or other lung infections.
The neurologic symptoms that you presented with were because of blood clots that can occur because of cancer.
The good news is that your neurologic symptoms are all improving.
