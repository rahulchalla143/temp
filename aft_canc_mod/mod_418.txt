Admission Date: [**2153-6-22**]        Discharge Date: [**2153-6-26**]   Service:  NME   DATE OF EXPIRATION:  [**2153-6-26**]  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Acute onset right-sided weakness and aphasia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82-year-old male with recent colectomy on [**2153-6-19**] at [**Hospital6 2561**] and with significant cerebrovascular risk factors who is transferred for IA tPA and conventional angiogram for acute- onset aphasia and right-sided weakness.
The patient underwent colonoscopy after having occult blood in his stool, which led to diagnosis of likely stage-D colon adenocarcinoma with liver and omental metastases.
A neurologist who saw him noted right hemiparesis and aphasia.
A CT scan showed early signs of infarction, particularly intracortex, and he is transferred here for further management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Recently diagnosed colon cancer, status post right colectomy on [**2153-6-19**] with possible liver and omental metastases.
Coronary artery disease, status post 4-vessel CABG.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Showed no history of stroke in the parents.

Heart has regular rate and rhythm with 2/6 systolic murmur at the base.
There is no carotid bruits or ocular bruits audible.

Optic disc could not be visualized well due to small pupils.
On motor exam, there was markedly increased tone in the right upper extremity.
On one occasion, there was tonic contraction of the right arm with tremulousness but no overt clonic activity.
Reflexes, his deep tendon reflexes are all present and slightly increased in the right upper extremity.
Non-contrast head CT shows massive cortical distinction in the left intracortex.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the suspicion that the patient had a left hemispheric stroke, he was sent for a conventional angiogram, which showed plaque at the bifurcation of the left internal carotid with poor distal flow.
Systolic blood pressure was around 130s to 140s, and he was not given any antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy.
