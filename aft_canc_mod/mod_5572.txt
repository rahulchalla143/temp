Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2183-6-24**] - CABGx3 (Left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, vein graft to posterior descending artery, vein graft to ramus) [**2183-6-11**] - Cardiac Catheterization  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 449**] is a 55 year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and current tobacco use who presents with dyspnea and chest discomfort for cardiac cath.
At that time, she had complaints of SOB, cough and chest discomfort.
A pneumonia was diagnosed.
In addition, an echo was done and showed and LVEF of 40% with severe focal hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and apex.
Since that admission, she underwent stress testing which showed a reversible anterior wall and fixed apical defects.
She can recall one specific episode approximately 2 weeks ago when she had severe DOE during which she could not walk more than [**3-15**] steps without severe shortness of breath.
After waking, she will sit up and her symptoms improve.
Hypertension 4.
Asthma 7.
Depression 8.
Hepatitis C: - Genotype 3a - Viral load 6,050,000 IU/mL ([**11-14**]) - Chronically elevated LFTs - Albumin 3.2, INR 1.1 ([**6-16**]) - Liver bx ([**3-/2175**]): Portal chronic inflammation with lymphoid nodule formation, interface hepatitis, increased fibrosis with early septa, lobular necroinflammation activity and patchy steatosis consistent with chronic hepatitis C, grade [**3-15**], Stage2.
She is not currently working, in part because she has bad peripheral neuropathy.

There is stable enlargement of cardiac silhouette.
The left hemidiaphragm appears elevated, however, there is an increased distance between this contour and the gastric bubble consistent with a subpulmonic effusion.
A small right pleural effusion is also noted.
There is associated left lower lobe atelectasis and right mid lung linear atelectasis.
IMPRESSION: Moderate left and small right pleural effusions which are larger than [**2183-6-26**].
Left effusion likely has subpulmonic component.

This revealed left main and severe three vessel coronary artery disease.

Given her history of hepatitis C, the hepatology service was consulted for assistance in her care.

Ms. [**Known lastname 449**] developed blood in her stool on heparin and a gastroenterology consult was obtained.
An ultrasound of her abdomen was obtained which showed  a coarse liver with no change in a hyperechoic lesion in the right lobe of liver which may represent a granuloma or a scar from previous trauma.
A CT scan was obtained and showed no significant abnormalities or changes.
A colonoscopy and upper endoscopy were performed which showed gastritis and diverticuli.
