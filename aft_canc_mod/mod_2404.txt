A 2.9 x 2.1 cm left lower lobe subpleural lung mass (3:42) and a 5 mm right upper lobe nodule (3:40) are noted.
Calcified nodule near the right hilum (3:33) likely represents sequela of prior granulomatous disease.
There is no mediastinal adenopathy.
Several enlarged right axillary lymph nodes measure up to 25 x 22 mm (3:22).
There is no pericardial effusion.
Well-circumscribed hypodense subcentimeter liver lesion in segment III (3:50) likely represents a cyst but is not fully characterized.
The liver is otherwise unremarkable without evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation or focal lesion.
Both kidneys demonstrate several subcentimeter well- circumscribed lesions which likely represent cysts but are not fully characterized.
There is extensive descending and distal transverse colon diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
The intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel are otherwise unremarkable without evidence of pneumatosis, free air, or obstruction.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
There is extensive sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Bone windows demonstrate no lesion that is concerning for metastasis or infection.
Mild multilevel degenerative changes are noted.
Left lower lobe lung mass likely represents metastasis, although tissue diagnosis can be obtained if indicated.
Right axillary lymphadenopathy likely reflects metastatic recurrence.
Extensive diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Head CT [**5-7**]: FINDINGS: In the right frontotemporal region, there is a 2.5 x 3.3 cm hypodensity with fine hyperdense rim and surrounding vasogenic edema (series 2, image 19).
There is slight effacement of the subjacent body of the right lateral ventricle but no significant shift of the midline structures.
At the left frontovertex, there is 2.2 x 3.0 cm hyperdense lesion, with mild surrounding vasogenic edema and overlying subarachnoid hemorrhage, similar in size to the lesion defined on the MR (2.0 x 2.7 cm).
At the posterolateral aspect of this process, there is an ovoid isodense focus measuring 1.2 x 0.9 cm (2:24), corresponding to the enhancing peripheral nodule on the MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] other foci of acute hemorrhage are seen.
There is no fracture.
There is no osteolytic or- blastic lesion.
No subcutaneous nodules are demonstrated.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of right frontotemporal lesion and left frontovertex hemorrhagic lesion, likely metastases (for further details, please refer to the MR [**First Name (Titles) 767**] [**Hospital6 1597**]).
MRI Head [**5-11**](post-rsxn): FINDINGS: The patient is status post left parietal craniotomy, in comparison with the prior study, the previously described left frontal lobe mass lesion, has been resected.
The T1 sequence without contrast demonstrates a nodular area of hyperintensity signal, likely consistent with blood products and apparently unchanged after the administration of gadolinium contrast.
The pattern of vasogenic edema is unchanged.
The right frontoparietal deep white matter lesion is unchanged and demonstrates again thick rim enhancement as well as mural enhancement as described in the prior examination.
Normal flow void signal is identified in the major vascular structures, the orbits, the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are unremarkable.
Status post left parietal craniotomy, there is a nodular area of hyperintensity signal in the surgical bed and posterior surgical margin, likely consistent with blood products, however residual mass lesion is a consideration, follow-up is recommended.
Similar pattern of vasogenic edema, the right frontoparietal deep white matter lesion is unchanged.
Residual vasogenic edema within the left frontal and parietal lobes are again noted.
Minimal focus of hemorrhage within the surgical bed is also unchanged.
In the interim, there has been interval right frontal craniotomy, with post-surgical changes seen, with pneumocephalus, small foci of hemorrhage.
There is residual vasogenic edema.
Additionally, there is pneumocephalus overlying the right frontal lobe, as well as small subdural collections bilaterally.
No new foci of hemorrhage are identified.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
Head CT [**5-16**]: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There has been no significant interval change since one day prior.
There are bilateral craniotomies with post-surgical changes in the left parietal lobe, including a tiny amount of pneumocephalus, residual postoperative hemorrhage and vasogenic edema.
Within the right temporal and parietal resection bed, there is pneumocephalus, hemorrhage and edema.
No new foci of hemorrhage are identified.
IMPRESSION: No significant change in the right temporoparietal lobe resection bed hemorrhage and additional postoperative edema and pneumocephalus within the left cerebral hemisphere.
Within the surgical bed in the right temporal and parietal lobes, there is residual hemorrhage, pneumocephalus, and vasogenic edema.
Compared to the prior study, there has been no interval change in size of the residual hemorrhage.
Postoperative changes in the left parietal lobe with tiny residual hemorrhage, pneumocephalus, and vasogenic edema are also stable.
There is a minimal leftward shift of normally midline structures of approximately 3 mm, unchanged.
There are no new foci of hemorrhage.
Ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber and configuration without evidence of hydrocephalus.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally aerated.
No significant interval change from the prior study in the postoperative hemorrhage within the right temporoparietal lobe resection bed.
EKG [**5-7**]: Sinus rhythm Modest ST junctional depression is nonspecific and may be within normal limits, but clinical correlation is suggested No previous tracing available for comparison   	Intervals	Axes Rate	PR	QRS	QT/QTc	P	QRS	T 89	156	98	366/416	28	-25	5   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the neurosurgery service on [**5-7**].
Post-operatively he was monitored in the ICU for 24hrs without incident.
On POD#1 he was found to have new weakness in the left upper extremity, and to be more lethargic.
A head CT was immediately done and there was new bleeding identified in the right sided resection cavity, as well as increased vasogenic edema.
Vasogenic edema was again noted, and lethargy persisted.
His steroids were initially decreased to 3mg QID, but had recurrance of left upper extremity weakness.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
