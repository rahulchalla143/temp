He was at a [**Hospital1 1501**] for 1 week and was noted to have poor po intake with difficulty swallowing.
He then took a sip of water and oral morhphine which he visibly aspirated and was in severe distress afterwards.
This morning he was noted to be in increased distress with a witnessed aspiration event.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Metastatic colon CA: diagnosed in [**2118**] with wt loss and abdominal pain; metastatic to lung and liver on presentation.
On [**2119-6-28**], he was found to have innumerable pulmonary nodules and increase in his right hilar mass and increase in the liver metastases, as well as a new splenic lesion.
He had evidence of progression on a CT dated [**2120-3-12**].

# Respiratory failure:  This is more likely due to progressive pulmonary metastases with possible aspiration component.
BAL cx grew oropharyngeal flora and yeast.
Pulmonary embolus is possible given his malignancy but less likely given overall clinical picture.
He was admitted with levophed and required addition of vasopressin.
# Metabolic acidemia:  This was from lactic acidosis and hyperchloremic acidosis from NS fluid rescusitation.
# Acute renal failure:  This worsened during his hospital stay.
# Liver Failure:  This is likely from replacement of liver by tumor.
Pt has decreased synthetic function with elevated INR but received vitamin K anyhow.
Ultrasound showed no portal vein thrombosis.
# Coagulopathy: Again, this is likely from replacement of liver by metastasis.
Pt received vitamin K without improvement.
# Metastatic colon cancer: Pt has end-stage disease and has progressed through multiple regimens of chemotherapy.
# Coffee ground emesis: This occurred on admission, possibly [**3-2**] esophagitis, gastritis, PUD, or mets.
Pt became increasingly bradycardic then asystolic on [**2120-6-20**] and expired.
