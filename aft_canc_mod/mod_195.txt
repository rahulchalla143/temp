Compared to the previous tracing of [**2163-6-30**] atrial fibrillation is new.
CHEST PORTABLE ([**8-16**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
Interval decrease in clot burden involving subsegmental branches of posterior basal segment of right lower lobe since [**2163-6-30**].
2.3 x 1.3 cm enlarging subpleural perifissural right lower lobe nodule, concerning for metastatic pleural disease.
Additional scattered sub 4 mm bilateral pulmonary nodules appear stable since at least [**2163-6-30**].
Minimal upper zone interlobular septal thickening may reflect volume status.
Stable distal esophageal thickening, compatible with esophageal carcinoma.
New perifissural hepatic hypodensity, incompletely assessed on current examination.
Although this may represent focal fatty infiltration, given history of malignancy, dedicated hepatic imaging is recommended to exclude metastasis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No fluid collection seen at the right elbow within the superficial tissues.
No fluid collection seen at the right elbow within the superficial tissues.
CXR ([**8-18**]): FINDINGS: There is new faint opacity in the left lower lobe which could represent early pneumonia.
There are trace bilateral pleural effusions.
Emphysematous changes including increased AP diameter and flattening of the diaphragms are seen.
No pneumothorax is identified.
IMPRESSION: Faint left lower lobe opacity could represent early pneumonia   Brief Hospital Course: ==== BRIEF HOSPITALIZATION SUMMARY ====  59 year old male with esophageal cancer presenting with FTT and hypotension and a-fib with RVR, given 5L of IVF now on neosynephrine, pt already anticoagulated without interruption on lovenox, transferred to ICU for cardioversion.
ICU Course: Patient was transferred with persistent afib with RVR to 150s for cardioversion.
Imaging notable for potential lung and liver involvement of primary tumor.
=== ACTIVE ISSUES ==== Hypotension: Likely multifactorial with dehydration from vomiting and poor PO intake contributing, as well as his new a-fib with RVR causing decreased atrial kick.
Infection given his abnormal substrate (esophageal cancer) was of concern.
He was treated with vancomycin and cipro for potential infectious causes while awaiting culture data.
He did have a red, warm elbow that he thought was consistent with an RA flare, though it warrants monitoring.
He was afebrile without a leukocytosis.
He has had a history of PAF in the setting of pericarditis related to his RA in his 20s.
A CT was done given his recent PE, and it showed a decreased clot burden.
PNA:  Pt w/ e/o PNA on CXR, w/ cough for one week.
Nausea has been improved, no vomiting during this hospitalization.
Likely metastatic progression, which would make him a non-surgical candidate.
He has had nausea and vomiting multiple times a day without relief with compazine and zofran.
RA: Possible involvement of his right elbow, however, edema in that arm is most likely [**1-26**] axillary vein thrombosis.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Angels at home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response  Secondary Diagnosis: hypotension GE junction adenocarcinoma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital because you had an abnormal heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation) with a rapid heart rate.
Also, you had a low blood pressure.
Your low blood pressure was most likely from a combination of dehydration and the abnormal heart rhythm.
Also, you had a pneumonia when you were admitted.
