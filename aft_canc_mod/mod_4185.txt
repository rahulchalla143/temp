She reported that the patient had 2 days of generalized body aches, fatigue, HA, increased SOB (above baseline), low back pain (per OMR is chronic).
No cough or fever.
Nasopharyngeal swab for influenza rule-out was reportedly sent from ED and patient was started on oseltamivir.
Past Medical History: 1) COPD, largely emphysema (FEV1/FVC 29, FEV1 24% pred [**6-/2113**]) - s/p bullectomy with RUL resection in [**2106**] - 4L of oxygen at baseline 2) Colonic polyps 3) History of embolic stroke which had hemorrhagic conversion s/p heparin [**2110-7-22**] (frontal and occipital) 4) History of PFO 5) Factor V Leiden heterozygosity 6) Hyperlipidemia 7) Inguinal hernia 8) Right ventricular dysfunction, likely due to pulmonary hypertension 9) Polycythemia, likely due to hypoxemia 10) Eczema   Social History: Worked as a security guard (vs computer scientist) at [**University/College **] library.
Physical Exam: VS: T 99, HR 91, BP 117/65, RR 16, O2Sat 91% (intubated with AC VT 400, RR 14, PEEP 7, FiO2 60%) GEN: NAD HEENT: PERRL, does not track movement, oral mucosa moist, NECK: No [**Doctor First Name **], no JVP elevation PULM: Coarse, but diminished breath sounds with crackles and left anterior base, prolonged expiratory phase with inaudible air movement in expiratory, copious thick secretions suctioned from ET tube CARD: RR, nl S1, nl S2, no M/R/G ABD: BS+, soft, non-tender, non-distended EXT: No C/C/E SKIN: Diffuse dry skin with some icthyosis of BLE and some psoriatic skin changes around face NEURO: sedated, pupils reactive   Pertinent Results: Admission Labs: 11.8>13.9/44.0<258 N81.0, L8.7, M9.6, E0.4, B0.3  PT 52.8, PTT 46.5, INR 5.8  142/4.4/98/42/17/0.5<132 proBNP 299 Trop T <.01  7.21/116/70  Studies:  [**2113-11-10**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia.
Intraventricular conduction delay.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2110-8-10**] the rate has increased and intraventricular conduction delay is now present.
Findings consistent with pulmonary edema.
Emphysematous changes and post-surgical changes in the right upper lung.
[**2113-11-11**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
New hypodensities seen in the current study can be due to evolution of infarcts but an associated acute infarct is difficult to evaluate.
[**2113-11-15**] Chest xray: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
Pre-existing bilateral opacities are unchanged in extent and severity.
The size of the cardiac silhouette, at least its visible parts, are also unchanged.
The presence of a small left-sided pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: 58 yo M w hx of COPD (FEV1 24% predicted), diastolic CHF, presents with two days of increasing DOE and weakness and fatigue.
Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  He was intubated in the emergency room due to hypercarbic respiratory failure with a pCO2 greater than 100.
He was felt to have a COPD exacerbation in setting of a likely community acquired pneumonia.
Though he had no history of fevers, cough, or chills, his elevated WBC count to 11.8 with 81% neutrophils as well as CXR findings of patchy opacities consistent with a pneumonia.
Though he continued to have periodic desaturations to the high 80s, he remained stable on face tent.
Patient needs repeat CXR at 6 weeks to ensure that bilateral lower lobe opacities seen on imaging this admission resolve.
If these imaging abnormalities are not resolved on repeat CXR, he will need high resolution chest CT to further evaluate his lung parenchema.
he had no evidence of GI bleeding and no history of trauma to cause concern for internal bleeding.
He is reportedly on Coumadin for a h/o CVA and factor V Leiden heterozygosity.
He was then aggressively diuresed as his chest xrays looked like pulmonary edema.
Chest Pain: He had one episode of chest pain during this admission and there was low clinical suspicion for a cardiac source.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Hypercarbic respiratory failure Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Pneumonia  Secondary Diagnosis: Chronic diastolic heart failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Has transferred from bed to chair since extubation, requires assistance   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath.
It was felt that you had a worsening of your COPD, as well as a pneumonia.
You were given antibiotics to treat your pneumonia.
The breathing tube was removed on [**11-14**] without complication.
You are also being given Lasix for diuresis and your goal for diuresis is approximately 1 liter negative per day.
You should have a follow-up chest xray in 6 weeks to assess for resolution of your pulmonary edema or stability of your lung disease.
