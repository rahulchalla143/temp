Admission Date:  [**2161-10-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2161-11-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2080-1-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Zetia  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1854**] Chief Complaint: Headache, Nausea, vomiting  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 3rd ventriculosotmy [**10-29**] Bronchoscopy with fine needle biopsy [**10-29**] [**11-5**]: Cranial Wound revision [**11-5**]: Replacement of Pulmonary Stent   History of Present Illness: 81M with known lung mass for which was reportedly refused workup for greater than 1 year, PET +, likely adenocarcinoma, recent admission for post obstructive pneumonia with increasing size of mass seen on chest CT scan, to undergo bronch next month.
Was complaining of headache, some n/v last week, now resolved, seen in office this morning, head CT today showed a preliminary read of Left cerebellar mass with mass effect on the 4th ventricle and possible tonsillar herniation.
He was then urged by his PCP to come to the ED for evaluation  Past Medical History: -AAA status post repair in [**2143**] -right renal mass status post nephrectomy in [**2145**] in the USSR -bladder cell CA -CHF --> systolic dysfn w/ EF 35-40% -BPH s/p TURP -coronary artery disease -hyperlipidemia -hypertension -bilateral claudication -status post bilateral iliac stents -chronic renal insufficiency - baseline Cr 1.7 -MGUS.
Engineer, occasional vodka use, no IVDU.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No focal neurodeficits are appreciated.
New left cerebellar mass with possible hemorrhage.
Midline shift and tonsillar herniation.
No significant change in mass effect.
Well-circumscribed hypdodense area in right frontal gyrus immediately adjacent to burr hole, slightly more prominent today, most likely related to tract of ventriculostomy.
Abdominal Plain Film [**10-22**]: A SINGLE VIEW OF THE ABDOMEN demonstrates surgical clips, likely related to prior vascular procedure, projecting over the L3 vertebral body.
Large paraesophageal/subcarinal mass, with mass effect on the left mainstem bronchus, and associated post-obstructive atelectasis of the left lower lobe, progressed from [**2161-9-28**], concerning for either a malignancy of bronchial or esophageal origin as noted previously.
Interval increase in size of numerous mediastinal nodes, compatible with disease progression.
Right lower lobe ground-glass opacities, with scattered nodular ground- glass opacities bilaterally, slightly improved from prior study.
Small pericardial effusion.
Left renal cysts.
Left adrenal fullness, unchanged from as far back as [**2158-9-15**].
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
MRI [**10-23**]: Left cerebellar 2-cm enhancing lesion, most likely due to metastasis.
Mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
No hydrocephalus.
Mild-to-moderate brain atrophy.
Left atrial abnormality.
Low limb lead voltage.
ST segment depressions in leads I, aVL and V5-V6 suggest the possibility of anterolateral ischemia.
Brief Hospital Course: 81M with known lung mass for which was reportedly refused workup for greater than 1 year, PET +, likely adenocarcinoma, recent admission for post obstructive pneumonia with increasing size of mass seen on chest CT scan, to undergo bronch next month.
Was complaining of headache, some n/v last week, now resolved, seen in office this morning, head CT today showed a preliminary read of Left cerebellar mass with mass effect on the 4th ventricle and possible tonsillar herniation.
He underwent MRI imaging with further identified the lesion within the cerebellum.
He uneventfully underwent Stereotactic third ventriculostomy to facilitate CSF drainage and avoid progressing obstructive hydrocephalus.
He also had a CT of the torso which identified a hilar mass causing some degree of stenosis on the pulmonary system.
Pathology of the bronchoscopy has revealed small cell carcinoma.
In subsequent days, there was some drainage noted around the third ventric site.
This was initially conservatively managed, but later came to require perioperative wound revision.
When he was taken back to the OR for cranial wound revision, interventional pulmonology concurrently replaced the pulmonary stent.
Post operatively, he is completely stable, without any focal neurological deficits.
