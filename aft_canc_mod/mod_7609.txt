The patient has a history of GBM s/p resection [**2136-12-30**] and chemo/radiation who was admitted to the OMED service for pancytopenia.
Last night, per ED history, the patient was walking to the bathroom and prior to reaching the toilet had a sudden syncopal event with fall and headstrike to bathroom wall with +LOC.
Per the patient, she was sitting on the toilet and felt an overwhelming "warmth" and premonition of illness.
She does not recall falling off the toilet or striking her face but she does know that this happened.
Of note, she had incontinence to stool but no frank seizure-like movements or tongue biting (witnessed by her daughters).
She was sent to hospital for syncope workup.
Cardiology was consulted and felt her elevated trop without cardiac symptoms was likely the result of demand-like ischemia in the setting of possible hypotension.
CTA Chest With and Without Contrast: no PE.
CT C-Spine Without Contrast: no acute process.
CT Head Without Contrast: no acute intracranial process.

ST segment depression in the inferolateral leads, new compared to earlier tracing of [**2137-2-5**], possibly representing ischemia.
ST segment depressions diffusely.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2137-4-7**] the ventricular rate is slower and  the extent and severity of ST segment depression is less, athough some still persist.
No findings related to recent trauma.
Expected postsurgical changes at the right frontal lobe and continued vasogenic edema.
No evidence of fracture or subluxation.
Severe right carotid bifurcation calcifications.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
No focal lung consolidation or evidenc of pneumonia.
Moderate-to-severe atherosclerotic calcifications and soft plaques at the descending thoracic aorta and significant calcifications of the coronary arteries.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2137-4-8**] at 3:00:00 PM      FINAL Conclusions The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the anterior septum and mild dyskinesis of the distal inferior wall and apex.
The apex is mildly aneurysmal.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction suggestive of multivessel CAD.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
CXR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2137-4-7**] 10:25 AM  FINDINGS: Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size, accompanied by pulmonary vascular engorgement, new bilateral perihilar alveolar opacities and peripheral interstitial septal thickening.
Findings are consistent with widespread pulmonary edema.
Note is made of an accompanying small right pleural effusion.
LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of [**2137-4-7**] 5:20 PM IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-1**] and [**4-7**] at 10:11 a.m.:  Moderately severe pulmonary edema has worsened slightly.
Small right pleural effusion has increased and tiny left pleural effusion may have developed.
No pneumothorax.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2137-4-8**] 3:27 AM IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary edema has improved since [**4-7**] at 5:05 p.m.:  Right PIC line has been partially withdrawn, tip projecting at the level of the superior cavoatrial junction.
Small right pleural effusion persists.
There is no pneumothorax.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2137-4-9**] 2:50 AM  Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 82F with HTN and GBM s/p resection, chemo, and radiation discharged 2 days ago from OMED admitted to the MICU for syncopal episode with NSTEMI, hypotension.
A unifying cause is either vasovagal syncope or seizure complicated by takotsubo/catecholaminergic myocardial toxicity and heart failre .
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure -The patient's initial CXR showed interval development of pulmonary edema in the setting of global myocardial hypokinesis and fluid resuscitation (2L).
She had a CTA which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism, no focal lung consolidation or evidenc of pneumonia and moderate-to-severe atherosclerotic calcifications and soft plaques at the descending thoracic aorta and significant calcifications of the coronary arteries.
She had a TTE which showed LVEF of 35%, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction suggestive of multivessel CAD, mild mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary artery hypertension.
She was gently diuresed with significant improvement of her respiratory status.
Upon transfer, she improved without further diuresis needs and upon discharge was on room air without signs of volume overload.
# Hypotension - Secondary to cardiogenic shock.
As there was initially some concern for sepsis, Vancomycin/Cefepime were intially continued but were stopped on [**2137-4-9**] after patient's imaging revealed no infection and her respiratory status improved with diruesis.
She also has been afebrile with no leukocytosis.
# Syncope: Patient recently had an admission for as-yet-idiopathic (chemotherapy-related vs keppra related) panyctopenia and has been neutropenic until as late as [**2137-4-5**].
She likely had a vasovagal event that preciptated her syncope.
# GBM/Neutropenia/Pancytopenia: Patient with pancytopenia thought to be related to chemo, last cycle [**2-25**].
Patient in category of mild neutropenia, thrombocytopenia to 21, and moderate anemia to 26.
Patient's neutrophils were trended and they improved to where patient was no longer neutropenic.

Likely due to low blood pressure after the fall, you went into cardiogenic shock, which is to say that your heart was not functioning normally and you required medications to help it pump effectively.
After this, you were observed to make sure no further issues with your heart continued.
Please note the following new medications:  START Colace 100mg by mouth twice per day Senna 1 tab by mouth twice per day Miralax 17g packet by mouth once per day as needed for constipation Aspirin 81mg by mouth once per day Toprol XL 50mg by mouth once per day  Otherwise please stop taking your previous medications (cipro, fluconazole, acyclovir) as you no longer need these for low blood counts.
