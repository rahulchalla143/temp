[**2139-2-17**] EGD: "Indications: Iron deficiency anemia, OB positive stools  Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated her understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and an endoscope was introduced through the mouth and advanced under direct visualization until the second part of the duodenum was reached.
There were no complications.
Findings: Esophagus:  Lumen: A small size hiatal hernia was seen.
Protruding Lesions A sub-mucosal 3cm lesion was found at the middle third of the esophagus at 22 cms from incisors.
Impression: Small hiatal hernia.
Colonoscopy [**2139-2-17**]: "Findings:  Flat Lesions A single medium angioectasia was seen in the proximal ascending colon.
Three 1 cc.Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] injections were applied for hemostasis with success.
[**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully.
[**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully.
A single sessile 4 mm polyp of benign appearance was found in the sigmoid colon.
Small grade 1 internal hemorrhoids were noted.
Excavated Lesions Multiple non-bleeding diverticula with mixed openings were seen in the sigmoid colon and descending colon.
Angioectasia in the proximal ascending colon (injection, thermal therapy).
Angioectasia in the descending colon (thermal therapy).
Stomach:  Flat Lesions A few small angioectasias that were not bleeding were seen in the stomach body.
[**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully.
Duodenum:  Mucosa: Erythema of the mucosa with no bleeding was noted in the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis.
Flat Lesions A single small angioectasia that was not bleeding was seen in the second part of the duodenum.
Impression: Angioectasias in the stomach body (thermal therapy) and in the second part of the duodenum.
Source of recent bleeding is likely due to angioectasias of upper GI tract.
Recommendations: Plan for push enteroscopy tomorrow in GI unit.
Push Enteroscopy [**2139-2-24**]: "Findings: Esophagus:  Protruding Lesions The previously visualized submucosal nodule was seen in the middle third of the esophagus.
Stomach:  Other Two superficial, nonbleeding ulcers secondary to recent coaptive cauterization were visualized in the gastric body.
No new vascular ectasia or source of bleeding was visualized.
Two superficial, nonbleeding ulcers secondary to recent coaptive cauterization were visualized in the gastric body.
Small Bowel Follow Through [**2139-3-3**]: "Assess for masses in distal small bowel.
However, the patient declined to stay for the remainder of the study, and so views of barium in the distal small bowel were not obtained.
Of note, the visualized portions of the proximal small bowel are unremarkable in caliber, contour, or mucosal appearance."
TTE [**2139-2-16**]: "MEASUREMENTS: Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: *5.5 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm) Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: *1.4 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm) Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: *1.2 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm) Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 5.6 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: >= 50% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Valve Level: 3.3 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm) Aorta - Ascending: *4.0 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm) Mitral Valve - E Wave: 1.4 m/sec Mitral Valve - A Wave: 0.7 m/sec Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 2.00 Mitral Valve - E Wave Deceleration Time: 231 msec TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP): *54 mm Hg (nl <= 25 mm Hg)  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  The rhythm appears to be sinus with frequent atrial ectopy.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity.
Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.
Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The mitral valve is not well seen.There is moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small (<1cm circumferential pericardial effusion.
There is soft tissue edema.
No erosions or soft tissue calcifications identified.
There is no erosion, fracture or joint effusion.
There is soft tissue edema.
No radiographic evidence for gout.
2) Incomplete images of the left ankle."
Head CT [**2139-2-20**]: "CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: assess for bleed, masses, etc  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 68 year old woman with new delta MS REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: assess for bleed, masses, etc CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: History of acute mental status changes.
COMPARISON: No prior studies are available for comparison.
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.  CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: No areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage or major vascular territorial infarct are seen.
There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or infarct."
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 68 year old woman with COPD, CHF p/w SOB now with cough REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: infiltrates.
HISTORY: Shortness of breath and cough.
Again, seen is a moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette.
There is persistent left lower lobe opacity that may represent an effusion, volume loss or infiltrate.
There is no new infiltrate."
Lateral Decubitus Film [**2139-3-1**]: "CHEST (LAT DECUB ONLY)  [**2139-3-1**] 11:37 AM CHEST (LAT DECUB ONLY) Reason: assess for extent of effusion  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 68 year old woman with LLL effusion/infiltrate REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: assess for extent of effusion Lateral decubitus films on [**3-1**].
HISTORY: Questionable left lower lobe effusion or infiltrate, question extent of effusion.
Due to the overlying soft tissue it is extremely difficult to tell the extent of any left effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 68 year old female with PMH of CHF, HTN and COPD on home O2 of 4L NC initially admitted on [**2-16**] with fatigue, dyspnea and tarry stools.
On admission, she was found to have significant crackles and lower extremity edema bilaterally with CXR consistent with CHF.
In addition, she had a low MCV anemia with a HCT of 19 and received 2 units of blood.
The patient became acutely confused and the prednisone was discontinued and pt started on colchicine and NSAIDS for the gout.
Subsequently the gout flare and the acute confusional state resolved.
On HD 7, the pt reported increased SOB and had a large dark guiaic positive stool.
She was emergently transferred to the MICU where she received 2units of PRBC and received a repeat EGD.
The EGD on [**2-24**] showed angioectasia that was not bleeding in the second part of duodenum.
Anemia:  On admission, the patient presented with Hct 19.9 with Fe studies suggestive of Fe deficient anemia.
Later in the hospital course the pt developed melanotic stools and in combination with decrease in Hct, this was suggestive of upper GI bleed.
The push enteroscopy reached the 2nd part of the duodenum and demonstrated AVMs again but no active lesions.
She received a small bowel follow through to better evaluate for a possible lesion in the 2nd part of the jejunum to the ileum.
However we are unable to reach this part of the small bowel due to technical limitations.
As the small bowel follow through was an incomplete study and only reached the proximal small bowel we could not rule out small bowel mass.
However, the study was not repeated due to low clnical suspicion.
She was given the presumptive diagnosis of active AVM.
COPD:  This pt has known, longstanding COPD on 4L NC at home with C-PAP at night.
The acute episode of confusion may have been secondary to pt's COPD exacerbation as well (see below).
The prednisone was given for acute episodes of gout not for her COPD exacerbation.
The ARF was presumed to be secondary to aggressive diuresis or s/p steroids and NSAIDS tx.
CHF: pt admitted with complaints of fatigue, SOB, orthopnea with bilateral crackls, significant bilateral lower extremity edema and CXR consistent with CHF.
Likely secondary to high output failure given anemia and CXR findings.
Previous echo [**2126**] revealed no valve abnormalities.
The patient reached euvolemia on HD #7.
On day of discharge [**Last Name (un) **] was also titrated up to 160mg qd for afterload reduction.
She was evaluated by rheumatology consult and initially treated with prednisone which was complicated by an acute confusional state.
Due to guaiac positive black tarry diarrhea, the colchicine and NSAIDS were discontinued (see GI bleed).
The patient responded to the prednisone, colchicine and NSAIDS with resolution of her gout flare.
On HD #14, while at a study she developed another acute episode of gout flare.
Although she had a history of an acute confusional state while on prednisone, there were no other available regimens to treat the gout flare as NSAIDS were restricted in this patient with severe GI bleed that was refractory to treatment.
Altered Mental Status: pt developed altered mentals status on evening of [**2139-2-18**].
This is most likely multifactorial in etiology with contributions from prednisone (started on [**2139-2-18**] for gout) + contraction alkalosis with compensatory respiratory acidosis due to extensive lasix diuresis + COPD causing worsening hypercarbia and hypoxia + ?PNA (pt with new cough, fever, and ?CXR) + abx (pt was on levofloxacin at the time) + GI bleed.
As multiple elements were thought to play a role in the development of altered mental status several intervensions were undertaken.
The patient responded quickly to the above interventions and a specific cause of the altered mental status was never firmly established.
On admission, the patient was found to have a positive UA positive for which she was treated with Bactrim/Levofloxacin for a combination of [**7-23**] days.
The patient was given several units of PRBCs for continuing GI bleed and her BP returned to [**Location 213**]/Hypertensive levels.
