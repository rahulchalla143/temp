Admission Date: [**2128-5-16**]        Discharge Date: [**2128-5-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2062-12-18**]        Sex:  M  Service:  MED   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 year old Vietnamese nonsmoker with a past medical history significant for hypertension and a remote history of tuberculosis treated ten years ago who presented to an outside hospital with a chief complaint of shortness of breath.
The patient was in his usual state of health until one week prior to admission when he developed an acute and chronic exacerbation of his baseline shortness of breath.
The patient woke from sleep with increased shortness of breath unable to walk.
Patient was treated for an asthma exacerbation with Solu- Medrol nebs.
His shortness of breath persisted and he was given a trial of BiPAP.
The patient continued to have respiratory distress and an arterial blood gas was obtained which revealed a pH of 7.19, a pCO2 of 59 and a pAO2 of 52.
The patient was then intubated and started on propofol drip and required increased sedation due to agitation while on ventilator.
On [**2128-5-11**] he was started on tube feeds and increased abdominal distention was noted.
A chest x-ray and KUB showed bilateral upper lobe scarring and fibrosis.
No dilated loops of small bowel or free air.
The patient continued to have some difficulty oxygenating and was noted to have increased sputum secretions requiring frequent suctioning.
The patient's sputum grew out methicillin sensitive staph aureus and he was started on cefazolin.
While ventilated the patient's peak pressure was elevated in the 40s and his plateau pressure was elevated in the 20s.
A subsequent chest CT was performed which revealed bullous emphysematous changes with equal scarring, external compression of the right main stem bronchus.
A CTA was not performed secondary to poor renal function.
With regards to the patient's mental status he remained unresponsive while hospitalized.
On physical examination the patient had anisocoria with the left pupil than the right.
A head CT was obtained which showed no bleed or mass effect.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Was negative for fever, chills, cough, weight loss or change in appetite.
The patient also denied abdominal or pleuritic chest pain.
Mild 1+ mitral regurgitation.
[**10/2127**] Thallium stress test revealing no reversible defect.
Tuberculosis diagnosed and treated 10 years ago in [**Country 3992**].
Bilateral lower extremity paresthesias.
Renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.7.
History of deep venous thrombosis and hyperlipidemia.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Borderline left ventricular hypertrophy.
No acute ST or T wave changes.
Head CT:  No significant atrophy, no bleed or mass effect.
Anisocoria noted with left pupil greater than right pupil.
Dry mucous membranes.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, faint S1 and S2, unable to appreciate any murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Lungs: Coarse breath sounds throughout with deceased breath sounds at right base.
No lower extremity edema.
No rashes noted.
Chest CT with contrast was obtained which revealed narrowing of the right main stem bronchus without evidence of associated mass lesion.
The differential diagnosis includes bronchomalacia, mass effect from pulmonary artery in the setting of pulmonary arterial hypertension, involving of the bronchus with tuberculosis.
The patient also had severe [**Hospital1 **]-apical bullous disease and fibrosis which is consistent with stated history of prior tuberculosis.
The results of these brushings are pending at time of dictation.
Results of these biopsies are pending at time of dictation.
The patient was then extubated without difficulty.
Following extubation the patient likely had an episode of aspiration while taking P.O.
He was seen by Speech and Swallow for evaluate for aspiration and he did relatively well with thin liquids.
Infectious Disease:  The patient spiked a fever during his hospitalization.
However, persistent white blood cell elevation and a sputum culture growing very rare gram negative rods prompted the team to re-initiate antibiotic therapy.
In addition, the patient had sparse gram positive cocci on sputum culture.
This responded to intravenous fluids and was likely secondary to dehydration.
Right main bronchus stenosis of unknown etiology.
Severe emphysema.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
