Admission Date:  [**2153-4-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-4-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-5-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: Nausea and vomiting  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 54 year old woman with NSCLC s/p right lung wedge resection and premetrexed/carboplatin who presented to the ED with nausea and vomiting and was found to have a slowly progressive pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
Her moderate pericardial effusion with early tamponade was found incidentally in [**2152-12-24**] upon followup chest imaging during an admission for digital amputation for treatment of Raynauds.
At that time a TTE showed a small-moderate pericardial effusion with RA and RV diastolic collapse.
The team consulted CT surgury but no intervention was pursued.
Since she was asymptomatic and HD stable at the time she was allowed to undergo surgery and sent home without intervention on the effusion.
Bedside echo showed pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
CT head negative for lesions.
CXR showed large heart.
On arrival to the floor, patient had no acute complaints.
She was no short of breath at rest.
She had no pain.

No space occupying lesion is seen.
Prominent ventricles and sulci are unchanged, compatible with mild global age-related volume loss.
There is no shift from normally midline structures.
No osseous abnormality is identified.
There is a large circumferential pericardial effusion.
There is sustained right atrial collapse, consistent with low filling pressures.There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
Compared with the findings of the prior complete study of [**2153-1-12**], the size of the pericardial effusion has increased significantly and tamponade physiology is now appreciated.
There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is mild dilatation of the RV with borderline normal free wall function, abnormal septal motion and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, all new compared with TTE dated [**2153-1-12**].
Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY:  54 year old woman with history of NSCLC who presented to the ED with nausea and vomiting and was found to have a slowly progressive pericardial effusion with tamponade.
# Pericardial Tamponade: Upon admission, the patient was noted to have a pericardial effusion with diastolic collapse of the right ventricle c/w tamponade physiology.
The drain was subsequently pulled and repeat TTE showed trivial pericardial effusion.
The most likely etiology of her effusion is malignant, however cultures and cytology were pending at the time of discharge and will need follow-up.
She was noted to have blood loss from this line upon arrival in the CCU.
She remained hemodynamically stable with no change in SBP or HR and no other source of blood loss identified.
#[**Last Name (un) **]:  Improved with hydration, likely pre-renal in the setting of large pericardial effusion and hypovolemia.
The patient had no symptoms during this admission.
#Coagulopathy: Likely related to hepatomegaly noted on exam, may also have nutritional component.
