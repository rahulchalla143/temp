Admission Date: [**2130-5-30**]        Discharge Date: [**2130-6-8**]   Service:  MED   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83 year old female with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome, untreated, hemorrhoids, bright red blood per rectum, previously refusing work-up, complaining of weakness and shortness of breath.
Because of the weakness and shortness of breath, she called EMS.
Work-up revealed a hematocrit of 15 with guaiac positive stools.
The patient reports ongoing hemorrhoid bleeding for some time and diarrhea.
Reportedly increasing shortness of breath, especially on exertion over the last weeks and months.
Denies light headedness, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain.
Denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, no dysuria, frequency or hesitancy.
Denies pain, only fatigue and weakness and feels cold.
History of bright red blood per rectum.
History of hemorrhoids  Granuloma in the left lower lobe on chest x-ray.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
General:  Fragile, chronically ill-appearing, non toxic, in no acute distress.
Heart:  Tachycardiac, regular rhythm, systolic ejection murmur heard over the left lower sternal border, radiating to the axilla.
Lungs: Rhonchorus breath sounds and crackles two-thirds of the way up bilaterally.
Chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure, a left pleural effusion.
The patient was then transfused five units of packed red blood cells for very low hematocrit.
She was typed and crossed and had two peripheral large bores intravenous placed.
The patient had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which was remarkable for mild erythema in the antrum.
Gastroenterology recommended a small bowel follow through as an outpatient, since there was no obvious source of bleeding from her colonoscopy.
We continued to follow her on the floor and continued to check for guaiac in her stools, without any further evidence of bleeding.
Her guaiac positive stools were likely secondary to internal hemorrhoids.
She will have outpatient follow-up with gastroenterology and have a small bowel follow through as an outpatient.
Congestive heart failure:  The patient, on admission, was noted to be in congestive heart failure.
Her chest x-ray showed pulmonary congestion.
An echo was done to further evaluate her congestive heart failure.
Wall thickness is mildly thickened with mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal cavity size and systolic function.
Her right ventricle was mildly dilated and showed ventricular systolic function was depressed.
She had mild tricuspid regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
With these findings, we thought that her congestive heart failure might be due to possible pulmonary embolism or just the pulmonary artery hypertension as a consequence of her emphysematous disease, due to her remote history of smoking.
A CTA was done to rule out a pulmonary embolism and it was negative and did not show any evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Hence, the patient's right ventricular dysfunction was attributed to her moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Prior to discharge, the patient had only crackles on the left side and on the right base, as opposed to presentation when she had crackles two- thirds of the way up in both fields.
The patient does have a history of myelodysplastic syndrome and possibly is in the stage where she has become transfusion dependent.
Despite the five units of packed red blood cells that was given on admission, to which she responded well to, she had continued to have a decline in her hematocrit.
She was last seen by Dr.  _______ in Clinic and was given her number to schedule an appointment for follow-up and further treatment of her myelodysplastic syndrome.
Urosepsis:  The patient was noted to have urinary tract infection with pan sensitive Klebsiella and was noted to have E. Coli in her blood cultures.
Pancytopenia:  Likely secondary to her history of myelodysplastic syndrome and consequent bone marrow myelofibrosis.
Pulmonary:  The patient was noted to have a chronic left lower lobe effusion upon admission.
With the five units of packed red blood cells that was given, the patient went into further congestive heart failure and her left lower pleural effusion grew in size.
The laboratory chemistries were noted to be consistent with an exudative process.
Bony sclerotic lesions:  Bony sclerotic lesions were noted on a CT scan which are presumably from her myelodysplastic syndrome.
Right ventricular hypokinesis.
Left lower lobe collapse effusion.
Left heart failure.
E. Coli bacteremia and Klebsiella urinary tract infection.
Blood loss anemia.
Anemia secondary to myelofibrosis.
Mild gastritis.
She is to have her pleural effusion cytology, serum protein electrophoresis followed up by her primary care physician.
