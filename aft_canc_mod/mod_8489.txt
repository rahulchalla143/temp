TKA [**3-23**], hypothyroidism, GERD  The patient is a 78-year-old woman with a complicated past medical history that includes bladder cancer, a cystectomy and an ileal conduit in the right lower quadrant.
She has had multiple abdominal surgeries and a large portion of her abdominal wall is mesh except where the ileal conduit was placed and surrounding this is a large parastomal hernia.
The patient was anemic and colonoscopy could not be completed because of the hernia but a virtual colonoscopy was performed suggesting a mass in the ascending colon.
The patient had a preoperative CEA level that was elevated at approximately 75.
On physical exam, she had a palpable mass in the right lower quadrant hernia sac which contained the right colon.
On [**10-3**], she underwent a right colectomy and parastomal hernia repair through her right lower quadrant flank incision for a presumptive R colon cancer.
Clinically she was slowly improving until on the evening of the 25th, she developed new enteric drainage through the site of a previous drain in the parastomal hernia space.
Ischemic necrosis of 2 feet of her ileum was discovered upon entry to the abdomen.
she was kept intubated and paralyzed and blood pressure was supported intermittently with pressors and fluid resuscitation.
At the time of reexploration, she was covered broadly for perforation as gross soilage was encountered with daptomycin, fluconazole, meropenem, and flagyl.
She completed a 10 day course of antibiotics and at the time of discharge has been stable off all antibiotic therapy for several days without fever or other sign of infection.
Her operative cultures grew only coag negative Staph, Enterococcus and strep viridans.
Nutritional supplimentation with TPN was begun postoperatively day #2 following fascial closure.
The ostomy itself appears quite healthy without edema or erythema.
The last of these - at the site of the peristomal hernia - fell out 4 days prior to discharge and some serous drainage has expressed from the wound since that time.
However, no local signs of wound infection or abdominal pain or systemic infectious symptoms have been noted.
During the course of her recovery she also complained of some R knee pain at the site of a prior total joint replacement.
This was evaluated clinically and radiographically by the orthopaedic service who felt that there was no evidence of joint-space infection.
She is free of infectious symptoms and has completed an appropriate antibiotic course   Medications on Admission: neurontin 800HS, dilaudid 2prn, ambien 10'prn, prilosec 20', levoxyl 100'  Discharge Medications: 1.
