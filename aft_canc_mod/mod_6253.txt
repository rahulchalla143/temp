History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 44696**] is a 66 year old female with Stage IV, NSCLC and history of recurrent malignant pleural effusion who was transfered for [**Hospital1 18**] for plamcent of a pleurex catheter.
Three days later she returned to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital with continued dyspnea nd was found to have a recurrent right pleural effusion.
On arrival she was tachypnic, hypoxic with increased work of breathing and was found to have non-occlusive segment and sub-segmental left lower lobe pulmonary emboli and near complete collapse of the righ lung by a large pleural effusion.

INDICATION: 66-year-old woman with non-small-cell lung cancer and progressive metastatic disease with malignant effusion and acute desaturation status post thoracentesis; evaluate for pulmonary embolism.
CHEST: There are non-occlusive filling defects within left lower lobe segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arterial branches (3, 43).
Thoracic aorta has a normal caliber, without evidence of intramural hematoma or dissection.
The right lung is almost entirely collapsed by a very large simple right pleural effusion causing mediastinal shift.
There is a focus of simple fluid in the left upper lobe, which appears fissural.
There are numerous pulmonary nodules within the left lung, measuring up to 25 x 19 mm (3, 77).
A small simple appearing left pleural effusion is also noted.
The right hilum is suboptimally evaluated but increased soft tissue in this region is suspicious for lymphadenopathy.
A lower pretracheal lymph node measures 17 x 16 mm.
There is no pericardial effusion.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are sclerotic metastases at multiple sites, without associated pathologic fracture.
The approximate T10 body is completely sclerotic, as is the left T7 pedicle and transverse process and the majority of the sternum and the right scapular tip.
Non-occlusive segmental and sub-segmental left lower lobe pulmonary emboli.
[**Name (NI) **] of portions of the compressed lung may be secondary to pneumonia.
Pulmonary nodules, thoracic adenopathy and numerous osseous lesions are compatible with diffuse metastatic disease.

Both jugular veins, subclavian veins, axillary veins, brachial veins, and basilic and cephalic veins demonstrates normal compressibility, respiratory variation in venous flow and venous augmentation.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in both upper extremities.
CT scan of the chest revealed non-occlusive segmental and sub-segmental left lower lobe pulmonary emboli, near complete collapse of the right lung by a large pleural effusion, [**Hospital1 20534**] of portions of the compressed lung may be secondary to pneumonia, pulmonary nodules, thoracic adenopathy and numerous osseous lesions are compatible with diffuse metastatic disease.
Overnight she developed relative oliguria and hypotension.
She was taken to the operating room on [**11-18**] and underwent VATS with evacuation of 2.6 liters of effusion fluid and placement of Pleurex catheter.
However, she experienced several episodes of respiratory distress followed by bradycardia and brief asistoly that was reversed with mask ventilation.
On [**11-22**] she once again became bradycardic and required intubation.
