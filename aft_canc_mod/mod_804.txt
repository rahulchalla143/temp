Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: 73 yo male with PMH sig for HTN, prostate cancer s/p prostactectomy in [**2101**], and recently diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma metastatic the brain, s/p L frontal craniotomy with metastatectomy [**6-21**], who presented to the ED today c/o increased cough over the last couple of days, with associated bilateral back/side pain.
He had originally presented in [**2107-6-17**] after an MVA secondary to LOC, followed by R arm weakness and L frontal HA, which led to the diagnosis of a left occipital heterogenous enhancement and right cerebellar lesion by MRI.
CXR showed a mass in the RML.
He was brought to the OR on [**6-26**] and underwent a left sided frontal craniotomy for tumor removal.
Pathology showed adenocarcinoma, and immunophenotyping was most consistent with a lung primary.
He had post-operative MRI which showed no complications.
Clinically, he was ataxic and had a partial right sided neglect.
On the day of admission he presented with minimally productive cough and back pain, going on for a few wks, however acutely worsening on the day of admission.
He denies shortness of breath.
He did have a low grade temp x 2 days.
In the ED, CTA chest showed saddle PE with bilateral peripheral PEs, bilateral lower lobe aspiration or pneumonia, and interval enlargement of lung masses.
Past Medical History: Hypertension H/o prostate cancer s/p prostatectomy in [**2101**] Lung Ca metastatic to the brain, as above.
Initially presented with R arm weakness and L headache.
Left parietal mass with extensive edema also involving left posterior frontal and occipital lobes, and moderate-to-severe midline shift.
Thickening of the cortex overlying the edematous regions, which may be seen in post-ictal state.
-denies any recent alcohol use  Family History: -denies any family history of seizures or strokes   Physical Exam: Vitals: 97.4, 112/74, 108, 26, 100% on NRB General: [**Location 7979**] speaking male appearing comfortable, with mild accessory muscle use.

Interval enlargement of the right middle lobe lung mass and of the left lower lobe nodular opacity.
Interval enlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes.
Bilateral lower lobe opacities suggestive of aspiration .
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
The wedge-shaped consolidation at the right base suggests evolution of a pulmonary infarction.
The opacity at the left base may be secondary to pneumonia or atelectasis.
There is a catheter in the left hemithorax which presumably is a left IJ catheter, its tip is in the region of the left brachiocephalic vein.
New 7-mm focus of FLAIR signal abnormality in the right posterior frontal lobe with possible corresponding faint enhancement, suspicious for new metastatic focus.
Marked decrease in vasogenic edema within the left frontoparietal lobe, and improvement to post-surgical change at the resection site in the left parietooccipital region.
Brief Hospital Course: 73 yo male with adenocarcinoma of the lung metastatic the brain, s/p metastatectomy [**6-21**], p/w PE.
No signs of RV strain on EKG or echocardiogram.
Respiratory status was intially tenuous, however, for > 72 hours prior to discharge he was comfortable satting about 93-94% on 5 L NC.
2) NSCLC with brain mets: Neurologic exam remained stable throughout admission with no focal deficits.
Repeat MRI revealed new metastatic focus but neuro oncology felt that no action should be taken at the present time considering his PE and anticoagulation.
Will continue Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
Patient did not have any seizures during this admission.
Continue Keppra for prophylaxis.
Pulmonary embolism   Discharge Condition: hemodyamically stable, respiratory status stable   Discharge Instructions: If you have any chest pain, increasing shortness of breath, headache, visual changes, fever, chills or any other concerning symptoms call you doctor or go to the emergency room.
