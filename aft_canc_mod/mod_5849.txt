Admission Date:  [**2140-9-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2140-9-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2099-12-31**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**] Chief Complaint: Syncope  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 98114**] is a 40 year old female with a PMH significant for metastatic breast cancer on navelbine/zometa/lupron admitted to the CCU for wide complex tachycardia.
The patient initially presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED after having a syncopal episode this afternoon.
She reports that she been feeling unwell over the past several weeks with complaints of an URI with symptoms including cough, runny nose, slight sore throat, and mild pleuritic chest pain.
Today, the patient reports that she was in the grocery store when she had a pre-syncopal episode.
She denied any preceding or antecedent chest pain, diaphoresis, n/v, pain in her jaw, arm, or chest, palpitations, or pain or swelling in her legs.
Currently, the patient is resting comfortably without complaints.
Denies CP/SOB, f/c/s, n/v/d, abd pain, HA, palpitations, pain radiating to her jaw, arm or back.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, or palpitations.
[**6-6**] found to have diffuse metastatic bony disease, started on lupron, zometa, and arimidex.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Physiologic pericardial effusion.
No aortic dissection.
No pleural or pericardial effusion.
Diffuse osseous metastases.
New inferior endplate T5 compression deformity.
Brief Hospital Course: # Rhythm: Likely atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction in pre-hospital setting manifesting as wide complex tachycardia in 200s, with 2:1 conduction narrow complex tachycardia in 110s in the ED, now in sinus with 1:1 conduction.
This appears to be less likely ventricular tachycardia.
Potential etiologies to her tachyarrythmia include pericarditis in the setting of recent viral URI, malignant pericardial effusion/pericarditis given metastatic breast CA, cardiac ischemia, or endocrinopathies including hyperthyroid.
ECHO was done which showed no abnormoalities or effusions, TSH was normal, no chest pain to suggest pericarditis and no evidence of ishcemia.
Pt was on telemetry for her hospital stay with no evidence of WCT.
She was given an Holter monitor at discharge to assess for further arrhythmias.
Low suspicion for thromboembolic cardiac ischemic event, and elevated TnT to 0.07 with flat MB likely representing demand ischemia.
ECHO showed good valve function and no wall motion abnormalities.
has close F/U with her oncologist.

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Aflutter RVR Syncope   Discharge Condition: stable Temp Max: 98.2 Temp current: 98.2 HR: 59-60 RR: 18 BP: 100-114/66-72 O2 Sat: 98% RA   Discharge Instructions: You had a very fast episode of atrial flutter that caused you to faint.
The rhythm resolved spontaneously and we started you on Metoprolol to try to prevent the atrial flutter.
Please also call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] if you notice any chest pain or palpitations, light headedness, trouble breathing that could be caused by the atrial flutter.
you will be started on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor to check for any more episodes of atrial flutter.
