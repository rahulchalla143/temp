Hazy opacity at the right lung base is similar to that seen on previous CT scan and otherwise, the lungs appear clear.
New left lower lobe pleural effusion and consolidation related to left lower lobe metastasis presumably representing hemorrhage.
New right lower lobe dense consolidation could be related to aspiration/infection.
