VATS and Chest Tube Placement  History of Present Illness: 59 y/o M w/hx of type 2 DM, HTN, who originally presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2177-7-23**] with acute onset of R sided pleuritic chest pain.
Per report, he had SOB due to the pain which was not different from his baseline shortness of breath.
He did have diarrhea for 24 hrs PTA.
On admit to [**Hospital1 **], his bp was 106/69, p 106, R 24, 94% on 2L, afebrile at 98.3.
CXR demonstrated R wedge shaped infiltrate.
He was intubated on [**7-24**] for hypoxic respiratory failure.
He then developed afib with RVR requiring a dilt gtt.
On [**7-25**], he had a bronchoscopy revealing an obstructing grapelike tumor in the RUL in the anterior and posterior segments.
Pathology of his tumor (from brushings during bronch) revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.
He was transferred here on [**7-29**] for further evaluation by IP of possible endobronchial tumor debulking.
Past Medical History: gallstone pancreatitis ruptured appendix s/p appy type 2 DM hyperlipidemia htn COPD necrotizing fasciitis fournier's gangrene prostate Ca s/p radical prostatectomy s/p ccy   Social History: Smokes 1 ppd x 40 yrs, no EtOH.
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: T: 101.9 BP: 141/77 P: 102 CVP 11 AC 600x18 FiO2 .5 SpO2 96% PEEP 10 PIP: 35 Plat: 25 Gen: intubated/sedated, grimaces to pain HEENT: pupils equal, sclerae anicteric, ETT/OGT in place Neck: R IJ in place, no erythema.
no cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy Lungs: bronchial breath sounds over R upper lung zone, with decreased breath sounds at R base CV: tachycardic, regular, no m/r/g Abd: obese, nt/nd.
Respiratory failure: Patient was admitted with respiratory failure secondary to post-obstructive pneumonia with loculated empyema formation.
Patient had VATS procedure performed by thoracic surgery, which demonstrated a loculated empyema and broncho-pleural fistula formation.
Patient was started on penicillin initially to cover Group A strep sputum culture which grew at the outside hospital but was then transitioned to vancomycin due to bacteremia with coagulase-negative staph.
Due to continued ventilation requirements and a likely prolonged course of assisted ventilation, patient had tracheostomy placed per interventional pulmonology.
Obstructing endobronchial lesion: Patient was initially admitted for stent placement and possible debulking of tumor mass to improve ventilation and oxygenation in right lung.
At outside hospital, pathology demonstrated the mass consistent with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.
Patient had bronchoscopy performed by interventional pulmonology which demonstrated continued mass obstruction.
Due to patient's acute illness and respiratory failure here, patient did not have further oncology work-up.
Fever Throughout patient's admission, he continued to spike low-grade fevers, most consistent with his draining empyema.
Patient did develop coag negative staph bacteremia and was being treated with vancomycin, starting on [**2177-8-8**].
Artificial Tear with Lanolin 0.1-0.1 % Ointment Sig: One (1) Appl Ophthalmic  PRN (as needed) as needed for dryness.
Insulin Glargine 100 unit/mL Solution Sig: One (1) Subcutaneous q finger stick: Patient was started on sliding scale to further control his blood glucose.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Lung 2.
Post-Obstructive Pneumonia with loculated Empyema s/p VATS and chest tube drainage 3.
Please re-assess patient's fluid status 2 days after his discharge to decide whether to continue or discontinue lasix.
You should discuss your new diagnosis of lung cancer and obtaining a PET scan.
