On presentation to the OSH, a large L sided pleural effusion was seen on chest X-ray.

Two weeks later, however, she returned to the hospital with recurrence of her  dyspnea and was found that pleural effusion had completely returned.
She underwent thoracentesis in the ED and this revealed bloody, exudative effusion that by report was positive for malignant cells.
Serum studies notable for elevated CA 125 at 49 (nl range <20) and CA [**81**]-9 within normal range.
The patient underwent a CT Torso which revealed L pleural mass and splenic lesions.
The patient was recently d/c on [**3-29**] s/p pleurex catheter for recurrent malignant pleural effusion.
