Essentially noted by her sons on [**Name (NI) 1017**] night that she had significant RUE edema compared to the left (left is her hemiparetic side).
Today, her NP[**MD Number(3) 100559**] a large R sided neck mass that had not been noted in the past, and she had a low-grade temp to 100 and was tachycardic in the 110s.
She had a subclavian line placed (currently undocumented) and was given 4L NS without improvement in her bp or lactate, so was started on levophed.
Had chest CT showing large amorphous neck and supraclavicular mass, differential hematoma vs malignancy.
Past Medical History: HTN Stroke [**October 2193**] at [**Hospital1 2025**] Spinal compression fx Dementia s/p G tube placement (after stroke)  Social History: Lives in [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] since 2 months ago.
Physical Exam: Gen: NAD Skin: healed burn wound on anterior chest wall (from childhood) Neck: prominent, firm, poorly circumscribed R neck mass CV: RRR, nl s1+s2, no M/G/R Pulm: CTA B Abd: S/NT, mildly distended; +BS; G-tube site C/D/I Ext: 3+ RUE, 2+ BLE, 1+ LUE edema; no clubbing, cyanosis; faint PT/DP pulses b/l Neuro: A+O->self only (says "[**Known lastname 101072**]"); only answers yes or no to most questions.

2) Right adrenal nodule cannot be assessed on this examination due to motion artifact which was likely due to patient fatigue from this extended study.
********** FNA Neck Mass B-cells demonstrate a monoclonal kappa light chain restricted population.
Immunophenotypic findings are consistent with involvement by a kappa-restricted B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.
*********** Right Upper Extremity USG [**2194-6-5**] Upper extremity DVT with thrombosed brachial veins and partially thrombosed axillary vein.
Markedly slow flow is present in the right subclavian vein, which may be related to this large right-sided mass.
*********** ECHO [**2194-6-6**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
************  Brief Hospital Course: 81F h/o CVA, who presented intially with hypotension, R arm edema, and large R supraclavicular/chest wall mass.
# Lymphoma: Mass in the neck.
Initially suspicious for hematoma from Chest CT ([**2194-6-3**]).
RUE U/S ([**2194-6-5**]) showed DVT with thrombosed brachial and partially thrombosed axillary veins, and slow flow in R subclavian vein, which likely due to stasis due to this large R-sided mass.
MRI ([**2194-6-7**]) showed the mass to be diffusely enhancing, suggestive of malignancy.
There was discussion about using radiation to reduce tumor burden for possible reduction in right arm edema.
However it would likely not help as edema is from hypoalbuminemia and DVT.
# Anasarca: Asymmetric swelling RUE>RLE,LLE>LUE appears secondary large R sided mass, along with R brachial and axillary vein thrombosis, and low albumin (1.8).
Morphine Sulfate 0.5-1 mg IV Q4H:PRN hold for RR <12   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1186**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Lymphoma in R supraclavicular region  Discharge Condition: Minimally responsive with stable vitals.
Discharge Instructions: She has a lymphoma in her neck and after discussions with the physicians and family, it has been decided not to pursue any further workup or treatment of her lymphoma.
