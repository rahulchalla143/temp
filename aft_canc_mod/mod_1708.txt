Admission Date:  [**2116-12-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2116-12-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-1-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Compazine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**] Chief Complaint: altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation/extubation  History of Present Illness: HPI: This is a 53 year-old gentleman with HCV cirrhosis and refractory lymphoblastic lymphoma/ALL on rituximab and prednisone who presents with altered mental status.
His mother found him this morning with increased lethargy and complaining of diffuse back pain.
The back pain was unchanged from his usual back pain, secondary to his ALL, and was not relieved by morphine or methadone.
He was recently admitted to the BMT service from [**11-27**] until [**12-1**] for fevers and progressive ALL.
Infectious work-up was unremarkable and his fevers were atrributed to a reaction to platelet transfusion.
Of note, he had another admission earlier in [**Month (only) **] at which point he developed a strep viridans line infection (from PICC line)-- the PICC line was removed, he was treated with a course of PCN G which was changed to augmentin at his last admission with the last dose due either yesterday or today.
While in the ED, he became more delirious, writhing around in bed, refusing pain medications, and perseverating on wanting to get out of bed to urinate.
He was given ceftriaxone, vanco, and acyclovir for empiric meningitis coverage.
CT head was negative and CT abdomen was notable for slightly worsened ascites, new bibasilar opacities.
Past Medical History: <b>HEMATOLOGIC/ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:</b> Mr. [**Known lastname 2479**] was diagnosed with lymphoblastic lymphoma in [**2116-1-31**].
He presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2115-12-30**] with complaints of diffuse myalgias and arthralgias.
A CT scan demonstrated multiple enlarged portahepatis lymph nodes (largest 1.5 x 2.7 cm)and portacaval lymph nodes (largest 1.9 cm x 3.4 ) as well as multiple mildly enlarged paraaortic lymph nodes, the largest measuring 1.2 x 1.9cm.
On [**2116-1-6**], he underwent a CT-guided fine-needle aspiration of a portahepatis lymph node which was nondiagnostic.
Tumor cells were diffusely positive for pan B cell markers CD20 and PAX-5, with co-expression of CD10 and bcl-2.
TdT staining was equivocal, with predominantly cytoplasmic staining and a rare cell with dim nuclear staining.
MIB-1 staining showed an overall proliferation index of 50-60%, with focal areas with a higher fraction.
The differential diagnosis was felt to include lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (precursor B-cell lymphoma/leukemia) or a blastic transformation/progression of a mature B cell lymphoma.
It was noted that a definitive diagnosis would require flow cytometry and molecular studies, which could not be performed because there were no blasts in the peripheral blood and a marrow aspirate could not be obtained (dry tap).
However, the peripheral blood sample was sent for immunophenotyping, which demonstrated a new population of CD34 positive cells and a small population of CD19 positive cells in the "blast" gait, without expression of TdT.
Given his significant liver dysfunction and other medical co-morbidities, the initial treatment regimen chosen for the patient consisted of R-CHOP, which was initiated on [**2116-3-4**].
He received a second cycle of chemotherapy on [**2116-3-24**], consisting of R-CHOP without vincristine, which was held secondary to neuropathy.
Course B was not given due to his history of hepatic cirrhosis.
A liver biopsy on [**5-8**] and repeat bone marrow biopsies on [**6-12**] and [**7-19**] have shown no evidence of recurrent lymphoma.
The patient presented on [**2116-10-15**] with myalgias, headache, mental status changes, and fevers.
A bone marrow biopsy demonstrated marked fibrosis and relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma.
The patient was noted to have recurrence of peripheral blasts on [**2116-11-9**], with a bone marrow biopsy on [**2116-11-11**] showing residual leukemia in the marrow.
Hepatic cirrhosis.
Chronic lower back pain.
Steroid-induced diabetes mellitus   Social History: The patient is currently living with his mother and his brother, [**Name (NI) 2259**].
Family History: The patient's father died of lung cancer at 78.
His maternal grandmother died of colon cancer 78.
He is separated  Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 101.1 BP: 87/50 HR: 71 RR: 23 O2Sat: 100% Vent settings: AC 600/14 PEEP 5 FiO2 100% GEN: intubated HEENT: PERRL (4-->2mm), sclera anicteric, no epistaxis or rhinorrhea, MMM, ET tube in place NECK: No JVD, no cervical lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: RRR, no M/G/R, normal S1 S2, radial pulses +2 PULM: Lungs CTAB, diminished breath sounds at the left anteriorly, no W/R/R ABD: Distended, +BS, difficult to assess HSM, +fluid wave EXT: No C/C/E, no palpable cords NEURO: opens eyes to voice, does not consistently follow commands.
No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
Aside from mild plate-like atelectasis at the base of the left base, lungs are clear.
There is no pleural effusion.
CT head: No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
MR with gadolinium would be more sensitive for intracranial infections or masses.
KUB: Non-specific bowel gas pattern without free intraperitoneal air.
CXR PA and lat: Interpretation is limited by patient rotation and kyphotic angulation.
However, there is no evidence of pleural effusion or focal consolidation.
There is a focus of linear atelectasis at the left lung base.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was a 53 year-old male with a history of relapsing refractory ALL on prednisone and rituximab and HCV cirrhosis who presents with fever, altered mental status, and hypotension.
Patient was hypotensive, started on pressors, given IVF, worsened in the setting of adrenal insuffiency, and synthetic hepatic dysfunction.
Patient, due to high drug tolerance, continued to have pain and was responsive on morphine drip.
Patient continued to show signs of discomfort and sedatation was switched to dilaudid and ativan drip.
Patient expired at 7:20 pm on [**2116-12-10**] secondary to respiratory failure from relapsing refractory ALL in the presence of the family.
