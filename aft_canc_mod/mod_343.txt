Admission Date:  [**2139-5-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2139-6-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2085-1-5**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54-year-old woman who developed Hodgkin's disease and was treated with mantle irradiation in [**2110**].
She did well with regard to her Hodgkin's disease but developed congestive heart failure and was found to have constrictive pericarditis and underwent a pericardectomy at the [**Hospital 9940**] Clinic in the early [**2126**]'s.
In [**2133**] she developed worsening shortness of breath and ultimately was admitted to the [**Hospital1 188**] in [**2138-4-7**] with respiratory distress and was found to have bilateral fibrothoraces.
On [**2138-6-11**], she underwent a left thoracotomy with decortication of the severe left fibrothorax with an excellent anatomic result.
After being discharged to rehabilitation she suffered a respiratory arrest from a mucus plug and was resuscitated and transferred back.
Since that time she has had recurrent admissions for respiratory insufficiency requiring multiple bronchoscopies and an extensive workup.
It appears clear that she has severe restrictive physiology resulting in severe respiratory insufficiency as a result of recurrent fibrothorax with a pleural RIND.
She also appears to have some trapped lung due to this fibrothorax which is resulting in chronic ventilatory dependence.
She is being admitted for right-sided decortication.
Congestive heart failure.
History of Clostridium difficile.
She was breathing through her trach mask without distress and talking without any problems.
Her neck has no cervical adenopathy.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without crackles or wheezes.
Extremities have no clubbing or edema.
RADIOLOGY:  Chest CT scan shows pulmonary fibrosis on the medial aspect of both lungs from the mediastinal and radiotherapy.
She has chronic scarring in both lungs from recurrent infections.
There are no pleural effusions.
There are no significant areas of atelectasis.
This was a prolonged surgery which was technically very difficult and the patient required eight units of fresh frozen plasma, nine units of packed red blood cells and 18 units of platelets for an estimated blood loss of four liters.
Her pain was initially controlled on intravenous narcotics and has now been weaned to p.o.
She had an excellent re-expansion of her lung postoperatively and should do well long term.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient has been experiencing prolonged nausea and it is unclear what the etiology of her nausea is.
She has no evidence for any intra-abdominal ileus or obstruction.
She continues on subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis and has had no problems with any ongoing bleeding since the time of her initial operation.
Her cultures from the Operating Room have grown methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and __________________________ and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] torulopsis.
vancomycin for two more weeks due to her recurrent Clostridium difficile.
She has no active infectious problems with a temperature of 97.4 and a white count of 12.7.
Endocrine:  The patient has hypothyroidism and is currently on Synthroid which will be increased to 125 mcg a day as this is her standard dose.
Throughout her hospitalization she has been treated with steroids to try to minimize the fibrotic reaction within her right lung.
Right-sided fibrothorax status post open decortication on [**2139-5-8**].
Right hemothorax status post VATS with hematoma evacuation on [**2139-5-14**].
Right hemothorax methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and yeast currently being treated on broad spectrum antibiotics.
Chronic nausea with nasogastric feeding requirement.
