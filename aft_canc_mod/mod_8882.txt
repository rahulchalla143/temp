Name:  [**Known lastname 3939**], [**Known firstname **]                      Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 3940**]  Admission Date:  [**2144-9-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2144-10-14**]  Date of Birth:   [**2095-7-17**]     Sex:  F  Service:  OMED  ADDENDUM:  The final read of the MRI done to evaluate for possible increasing subdural hematoma versus emergence of new intracranial metastasis was consistent with meningeal enhancement suggesting metastatic disease of leptomeningeal involvement.
A more focal MRI was repeated to rule out optic nerve infiltration of metastatic cancer cells as a cause of the patient's papilledema.
Thus, the decision was made to go ahead with attempts to carry out a lumbar puncture in order to determine whether or not malignant cells existed in the CSF requiring Ommaya shunt for intrathecal chemotherapy.
The patient was transferred to the ICU for bur hole evacuation of her subdural hematoma and placement of a subdural drain to permit lumbar puncture by Neuro-Oncology.
Lumbar puncture was done and cytology was negative for malignant cells so there was no need for an Ommaya shunt.
In the interim, she has developed no new neurological complaints other than the persistent blurry vision.
In regards to her fever, Radiology notified the team of significant evidence of sinusitis by CT.
The patient was thus started on Levaquin but subsequently developed itching and rash on her hands bilaterally.
The patient is taking good p.o., no nausea or vomiting.
