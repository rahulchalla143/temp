Although there is some restricted diffusion remaining at the posterior aspect of the surgical site, it is unclear whether this is due to residual lesion or due to artifacts.
Increased signal in the adjacent brain near the surgical site and some subarachnoid signal could be due to subarachnoid blood and small area of brain edema, but evaluation remains limited secondary to artifacts.
