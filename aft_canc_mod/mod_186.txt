#  GI bleed: Hct 22 on admission secondary to duodenal ulcer, that has previously since been clipped and injected.
Patient presented to ED with active BRBPR and hyptension, given 2 units pRBCs and 1 liter NS.
Patient was electively intubated for upper endoscopy which demonstrated ulcer at the junction of first part of and second part of the duodenum which was then endoclipped and injection.
GI recommended if further bleeding would need surgical/IR intervention.
On transfer to the floor patient is tachycardic and tachypneic.
Patient was maintained on IV PPi [**Hospital1 **] with active type and screen and two large bore IVs.
# Chronic renal insufficiency: Baseline Cr 1.9, however Cr on admission 1.6 which improved to 1.5.
UA suggestive of UTI with urine culture with gram + bacteria, urine culture with enterococcus that is sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
# Leukocytosis: WBC 29.2 on admission which trended down to 21 which is patient's baseline.
Patient has known MDS, and persistent leukocytosis.
Patient has been afebrile with no other localizing symptoms.
Patient was previously hypotensive in the ICU so beta blocker was held in teh setting of GI bleed, once stabilized was discharged back on outpatient beta blocker dose which was converted to long acting.
# Chronic diastolic CHF: Echo on last admission shows preserved EF of 60%.
Patient appears to have evidence of volume overload on exam with significant bilateral lower extremity edema and crackles in bilateral lung fields after transfer out of the MICU likely secondary to volume resuscitation and diastolic heart failure.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient not anticoagulated secondary to active GI bleed and previous history of GI bleed.
# h/o MDS: Baseline HCT in 30s, currently 29, platelets in low 100s, with persistent leukocytosis.
# h/o pulmonary fibrosis: Uses 2L oxygen at baseline which was continued on admission.
Patient with some evidenec of fluid overload on exam after transfer out of the MICU was diuresed appropriately with 20 IV lasix x2 with some mild subjective improvement in shortness of breath.
Patient was started in ipratropium nebs standing which also appeared to help with shortness of breath.
# Prophylaxis: pneumoboots .
# Access: 2 large bore PIVs .
Morphine 10 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: One (1)  PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for dyspnea, pain: please hold for sedation or RR < 12.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - LTC  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: upper GI bleed .
Secondary: Anemia, Acute blood loss duodenal ulcer with bleed [**2196-4-26**] Chronic renal insufficiency -baseline Cr 1.9 chronic CHF HTN A-fib Hypothyoidism MDS Hct ~30s, plts ~100, worsening leukocytosis Pulmonary fibrosis on home 02 (2L) s/p Right Hip Replacement s/p Right Knee Replacement s/p Appendectomy   Discharge Condition: afebrile, vital signs stable, awake, alert, oriented x3, NAD   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with an upper GI bleed.
Initially you were in the ICU and were somewhat unstable, however your bleeding stopped and your hemodynamics improved.
Medication changes: 1) You were started on low dose oral lasix to prevent fluid accumulation in your lungs 2) Your beta blocker was changed to long acting 3) You were started on a proton pump inhibitor twice a day given your GI bleeding 4) You were started on an antibiotic given a urinary tract infection for which you should complete the outpatient course .
In addition, we would reccomend that on transfer to rehab you have a palliative care consult.
Given you diastolic heart failure you should have daily weights every morning and if you are noted to have > 3 pound weight gain your dose of lasix should be increased.
