Admission Date:  [**2205-1-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2205-1-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2123-6-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Lisinopril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central venous line insertion   History of Present Illness: 81 y/o male with extensive coronary history who presented with cough and malaise x 1 day.
The patient has a chronic cough but felt worse over the past day.
Also associated with nb/nb emesis x 1.
Came to emergency room and triggered immediately for HTN with presure in 60's on arrivals, repeat SBP 90-100, but then his blood pressures fell again.
He was in rapid atria fibrilation on arrival with an initial rate of 133.
Of note, Last week he had been admitted to the cardiology service for DOE with cath, MIBI demonstrating diastolic failure, CABG consistent with prior cath showing widely patent.
He was diuresed during that admission with resolution of symptoms and discharged.
Chest x-ray with no findings but empirically treated with broad antibiotics for presumed HAP.
New acute renal failure, elevations in Alk Phos/AST/Lipase.
The patient's laboratory data demonstrated new renal failure, leukocytosis, elevated AST and lipase.
Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated RUQ cholelethiasis without cholecystitis.
He received a total of 2 liters of fluid in the emergency room.
Hypertension 2.
Hyperlipidemia 3.
H/o remote inferior posterior MI 4.
CAD s/p CABG in [**2196**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, SVG to OM1 and OM2) 5.
Mild aortic stenosis 6.
GERD, chronic gastritis, s/p treatment for H. Pylori, path with 7. high grade dysplasia on [**12/2204**] EGD bx 7.
Family History: Father died from an MI at age 62.
Physical Exam: GEN: Elderly chinese gentleman, alert and fully oriented, mildly weak, no acute distress.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, pupils reactive 3 to 2mm, oropharynx clear, mildly dry.
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: [**3-10**] mid-peaking systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border without radiation.
Mild distention / gas.
Soft, non-tender, distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding.
No splenomegaly.
No spider angiomas.
Large hepatic mass with rapid arterial enhancement and washout consistent with a hepatocellular carcinoma.
The right portal vein is occluded with tumor thrombus and the proximal left portal vein is also likely occluded.
Non occlusive tumor thrombus is also noted within the main portal vein and there is cavernous transformation at the porta hepatis.
[**2205-1-20**] CT Chest: IMPRESSION: Essentially unremarkable chest CT without evidence for infection or metastatic disease.
MRI [**1-17**]: Large mass almost completely replacing the right lobe of liver with invasion of the right portal vein.
The imaging features are far more suggestive of tumor than abscess.
Differential would include a primary HCC, cholangioncarcinoma or a metastasis.
EKG [**2205-1-16**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Q waves in leads II, III and aVF suggest possible prior inferior myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2205-1-8**] atrial fibrillation is new.
Q waves in leads II, III, aVF and V4-V6 suggest possible prior inferior and myocardial infarction.
Compared to tracing #1 atrial fibrillation has been replaced by normal sinus rhythm.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**1-17**]: RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: There is a large mass in the right lobe of the liver which is echogenic and does not demonstrate any detectable flow on Doppler images.
Small stones are noted in the gallbladder, which is partially collapsed without wall edema or pericholecystic fluid.
There is no free fluid in the abdomen.
Findings concerning for hepatic abscess.
Differential diagnosis includes necrotic tumor such as HCC although this is considered less likely.
Cholelithiasis, without acute cholecystitis.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 M with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2196**], mild aortic stenosis, distolic heart failure, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension who presented on [**1-16**] with fever, worsening cough, nb/nb vomiting x 1, palpitations, and dyspnea.
During workup, found to have large liver mass which was determined to be hepatocellular carcinoma.
1) Hepatocellular carcinoma:  During workup in ICU, was found to have elevated liver function tests.
RUQ ultrasound showed a large mass which was further investigated with MRI.
This was concerning for Hepatocellular carcinoma versus cholangiocarcinoma.
After consultation with Oncology and Hepatology, a triple phase MRI was performed which confirmed the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.
2) SIRS physiology - Patient presented in atrial fibrillation with RVR and hypotension.
Patient remained afebrile with no localizing signs/symptoms.
Also did not have any positive blood/urine cultures.
Physiology may have been related to dehydration (from increased diuresis) and IVC compression which led to decreased preload which, in the setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR could have led to hypotension.
3) Atrial Fibrillation - Due to hypotension, the patient's metoprolol was held.
4) CHF - The patient was noted to have peripheral edema, which was thought to be secondary to fluid resuscitation.
- Oncology follow-up - ?anticoagulation for afib/Tumor burden - ?aspirin for CAD  Medications on Admission: aspirin 81 mg Tablet atorvastatin 40 mg Tablet docusate sodium [Colace] 100 mg Capsule [**Hospital1 **] ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) [Vitamin D] 50,000 unit Capsule One (1) Capsule by mouth once a month.
9. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
- Hepatocellular carcinoma - Acute on chronic systolic heart failure Secondary diagnosis: - Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were seen in the hospital for worsening shortness of breath, and were found to be hypotensive and in atrial fibrillation (abnormal heart rhythm) upon arrival to the emergency room.
No source of infection was found, and a chest x-ray and CT showed no signs of pneumonia.
However, you were found to have a large mass in the right lobe of your liver that was determined to be hepatocellular carcinoma, a type of cancer.
If you notice your weight increase by 3 pounds, call your cardiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**].
