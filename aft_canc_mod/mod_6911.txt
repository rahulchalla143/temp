BRIEF SUMMARY OF RECENT HOSPITALIZATION [**Date range (1) 108333**]: The patient presented with hypoxic/hypercapnic respiratory failure due to PNA with effusions attributed to diastolic heart failure.
Patient was continued on Lovenox for chronic DVT h/o PE.
She developed a new wound possibly from plexipulses and required extensive wound care for multiple wounds.
Per the daughter, [**Name (NI) 108329**], the patient developed diarrhea during her recent hospitalization that has persisted since discharge.
The patient had a "tought day" with some agitation and apparent discomfort with breathing.
When [**Name (NI) 108329**] noted tachycardia and fever accompanying the loose, yellow non-bloody stools with an increasing O2 requirement, the patient was brought into the ED .
Exam revealed crackles and decreased BS.
EKG showing RBBB with old TWI in 3, sinus tach.
She complains of generalized chronic weakness and has pain during wound dressing changes.
The patient has a cough productive of green sputum once on arrival.

New mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion.
Persistent moderate left pleural effusion and dense retrocardiac opacity which may represent left lower lobe collapse or, less likely, consolidation.
No left upper extremity DVT.
Left thyroid cyst.
Brief Hospital Course: An 82 year old lady with multiple medical problems recently discharged for PNA presents with 3 days of diarrhea accompanied by tachycardia & fever with concern for new left pneumonia despite levaquin therapy.
Her exam and appearance is concerning for respiratory distress.
1) Pneumonia: The patient was found to have a new left sided pneumonia, retrocardiac opacity and L pleural effusion on CXR from either new process or aspiration.
On admission to the medicine service she was found to be in hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure and was transferred to the ICU.
IV fluids were administered for her acute on chronic CKD (see below) which may have lead to some pulmonary edema.
Sputum culture was done but did not reveal the source of her pneumonia.
She remained afebrile for the length of her admission.
Prior to discharge a repeat chest xray showed a stable left-sided pleural effusion, new small right sided pleural effusion (thought to be secondary to holding lasix for hypotension for over a week), and stable retrocardiac opacity.
2) Diarrhea: This may have been the cause to the patient's volume loss, leading to hypotension and eventually to ATN.
While initially guaiaic negative, it was felt to be due to antibiotic use, infectious or Crohn's flare.
In the setting of thrombocytopenia she had loose guaiac positive, dark/tarry stools.
It was unclear if this was a [**Name (NI) 4522**] flare of small bleed from anticoagulation (on heparin at the time) or thrombocytopenia.
The GI service was consulted and felt that flexible sigmoidoscopy may help elucidate whether there is new dysplasia or worsening of her Crohn's.
It remains unclear what caused her diarrhea but it was encouraged that she maintain a lactose-free diet as this was felt to exacerbate the issue.
3) Diastolic Heart Failure: Her most recent echo suggests hyperdynamic stiff ventricle as supported by elevated BNP, EF 70-80%.
However this was done in the setting of what appeared to be septic physiology.
Her lasix and metoprolol were held on admission for hypotension and renal failure.
She was felt to be pre-renal given the diarrhea, which was likely responsible for her elevated troponin on this admission.
However with hypotension and respiratory failure, she was started on stress dose regimen which was eventually tapered.
6) MDS and Related Anemia: The patient is known to have chronic anemia secondary to both MDS and CKD.
7) DVT/PE: Patient had chronic DVT/PE in the past for which she was on lovenox, which was initially continued.
In the setting of acute renal failure she was switched to heparin for approximately 2 days at which point her thrombocytopenia became significantly worse (plt 49 at lowest).
She was also found to have guaiac + stools and tarry loose stools at times.
Given her risk of bleeding (anemia, thrombocytopenia) it was felt the risk of anticoagulation was greater than the benefit, despite her underlying PE/DVT history.
The issue of anticoagulation should be readdressed once her more pressing issues, namely intermittent bloody stools and thrombocytopenia are resolved.
Given her extensive upper extremity swelling of the L arm, an upper extremity US was done to r/o DVT which was negative.
8) Hemorrhagic bullae s/p rupture: Much of this is likely due to her years of steroid use.
9) GERD: In the setting of guaiac positive stools she was switched from omeprazole to protonix IV for two days while concern for active bleed was ruled out.
11) Nutrition: The patient has very poor appetite.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for dyspnea.
Loperamide 2 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for diarrhea.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 1643**] center  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pneumonia Acute Tubular Necrosis of the kidney  Secondary: Thrombocytopenia Anemia MDS   Discharge Condition: hemodynamically stable and afebrile, 92% on 3L   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for diarrhea and pneumonia.
You were found to be hypotensive (low blood pressure) and have respiratory failure which required you to be admitted to the ICU.
For your diarrhea you were given pulse dose steroids and are now on a taper of prednisone.
If you experience any shortness of breath, chest pains, abdominal pains, fevers or chills, or any other concerning symptoms please call your doctor or return to the emergency room.
