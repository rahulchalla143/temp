Admission Date:  [**2111-1-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2111-2-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2055-7-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Crixivan  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2745**] Chief Complaint: Fevers, night sweats, diarrhea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 55 M with AIDS, most recent CD4 count 45 on [**First Name3 (LF) 2775**], VL 1,560 in OMR (100,000 per pt), h/o PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], and [**Name10 (NameIs) 1074**] pancreatitis who presents with 1 wk fevers, chills, night sweats and two days diarrhea and cough.
He was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for rehydration, stool for culture, O and P, [**Hospital1 **], repeat CBC, also concern for PCP/TB/lymphoma.
Received levaquin for diarrhea and respiratory symptoms (cough).
Also had nausea but no vomiting, no headache.
Admitted to MICU for rule out TB and GI infectious work.
Tob: 2 packs per day for 20 years (40 pack-years), quit 18 years ago Alc: 1 pint/week, quit 18 years ago   Family History: Father killed, died of head trauma at age 25.
2 brothers deceased from DM (one of which had juvenile DM and received a kidney from pt).
NECK - no posterior/anterior LAD, no JVD appreciated.
CV - RRR, no murmurs or rubs appreciated.
LUNGS - crackles heard at lung bases bilaterally, R>L with occasional end-expiratory wheeze, good air movement bilaterally,  ABD - NABS, soft, non-tender, non-distended.
No organomegaly appreciated.
EXT - no edema.
2+ dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial pulses bilaterally SKIN: No rashes/lesions, ecchymoses.
Otherwise, no No diagnostic interval change.
CXR [**2111-2-1**]: Progressive distention of mediastinal veins suggest volume overload also responsible for increased cardiac diameter and pulmonary vascular engorgement, though there is no clear pulmonary edema.
Bibasilar infrahilar opacification is attributable to atelectasis.
No pneumothorax.
CT chest/abd/pelvis [**2111-2-1**]:  CT CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are numerous, but do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
There are no pathologically enlarged axillary nodes.
A small cluster of epicardial nodes measures up to 8 mm in short axis dimension and is increased in size.
Linear atelectasis or scarring is present in the right lower lobe, with additional areas of dependent atelectasis bilaterally.
There is a 4-mm nodule in the right middle lobe (2:28) with additional tiny noncalcified nodules seen bilaterally in subpleural location (2:24, 26).
In [**2107**], innumerable nodules were present bilaterally, a pattern that has nearly entirely resolved.
No areas of consolidation or ground- glass opacification are identified.
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Allowing for non-contrast technique, the liver, pancreas, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.
A small linear density, likely calcified, could be postoperative (2:67).
Numerous enlarged lymph nodes are present about the lesser curvature, celiac axis, and in the periportal and peripancreatic retroperitoneum.
Review of previous CT of [**11-9**], [**2107**], shows that these nodes have increased uniformly in size and number.
There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.
No ascites or free intraperitoneal air.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The bladder, distal ureters, prostate and seminal vesicles, rectum and sigmoid colon appear unremarkable.
There are no pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes.
BONE WINDOWS: No lesions worrisome for osseous metastatic disease are identified.
Bilateral subcentimeter pulmonary nodules could relate to an infectious or inflammatory process, but are much improved from prior CT of [**2107**].
No pulmonary consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
Differential diagnosis includes infectious etiology or lymphoproliferative disorder.
He came in with a complaint of approximately 2 weeks of fevers & diarrhea.
Received levaquin for diarrhea and respiratory symptoms (cough).
Also had nausea but no vomiting, no headache.
He was admitted to MICU for rule out TB and GI infectious work up.
Differential diagnosis radiologically included infectious etiology or lymphoproliferative disorder.
Given intermittent [**Name (NI) 2775**] (Pt reports history of non-compliance with medication) and prolonged depressed CD4 counts, there was concern for initial manifestation of AIDS-defining lymphoma or malignancy, or TB or other opportunistic infection.
Renal failure.
Pt has chronic renal failure.
Renal U/S [**6-15**] ruled out obstructive uropathy.
HIV - Patient has a history of non-compliance with his medications.
Etiologies include hyervolemic, hypovolemic or euvolemic hyponatremia.
Pt has little evidence of third spacing to suggest hypervolemia with decreased circulating volume:  No dependent edema.
Pt does have some scattered crackles over lung bases bilaterally.
Most likely etiology is hypovolemic hyponatremia.
Causes include renal loss and extra-renal losses.
Expect Una>20 and FEna>1% with renal etiology.
Una 89, Fena calculated at 2.85%, both consistent with renal loss.
Given Pt's HIV history with chronic renal failure, HIV nephropathy likely.
GI losses could also be contributing given Pt's recent history of diarrhea (expect Una<10 and Fena<1% with GI etiology).
MCV was normal, and iron studies revealed low iron (18), high TIBC (138), high ferritin (1492).
Low iron with high ferritin with a normocytic anemia is consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Low haptoglobin suggests possible hemolytic anemia.
Low retic count suggests there might be a hematologic component of the anemia.
Metabolic Acidosis:  Patient's bicarbonate was 14 with a normal anion gap, consistent with a Non anion gap acidosis.
Most likely etiologies are GI losses (given Pt's h/o diarrhea) and RTA (either defective distal H+ secretion or decresed proximal bicarb reabsorption).
Viral infection 2.
Vital signs stable.
You were admitted to the Medical Intensive care unit to manage your fever and shaking.
Over the course of 4 days, your night sweats, fever, and diarrhea resolved.
To determine the cause of your presentation, multiple tests for infection were sent.
You were put on respiratory precautions until we were able to rule out tuberculosis.
All of these tests, including the test for tuberculosis (TB), came back negative.
However, there are a few tests for infection that are still pending.
You had a CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
This showed enlargement of lymph nodes in the epicardium (around the heart), in the upper abdominal retroperitoneum and in the epigastrium (above the stomach).
Because we did not find an infectious cause of your symptoms, this was concerning for a lymphoproliferative disorder.
Another possible cause of your symptoms is Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome.
As the immune cells are stimulated to grow by the antiretroviral medication, patients can develop a worsening of clinical symptoms related to an opportunistic infection like a virus.
If you develop further fevers, night sweats, diarrhea, or any other symptoms that are concerning to you, please return to the Emergency Department for evaluation.
