Patient notes that he was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] for dyspnea and lightheadedness.
After being discharged on [**9-8**], patient again developed lethargy and loss of energy over the subsequent week and a half.
In addition, patient noted poor appetite and nausea.
Also felt thirsty and dehydrated.
In addition, patient noted urinary incontinence, urinary frequency, but with low urine volumes of dark yellow color.
Patient also with urinary retention on admission (no recent problems, per patient) and foley was placed, relieving patient of blood-tinged urine x600cc.
Was also found to have acute on chronic kidney failure with creatinine of 5.6 although without hyperkalemia.
Labs were notable for anemia (explained as chronic) with crit in the low 20s and leukocytosis of 17,000, but without any evidence of ongoing blood loss.
On the floors, patient became hypotensive with SBPs in low 80s, adn was transferred to ICU.
Repeat CXR after fluids did not show any volume overload.
Also noted to have an episode of bradycardia (known history of tachy/brady).

# Septic shock/Urosepsis: The patient presented from [**Hospital1 **] with evidence of sepsis from a urinary source requiring phenylephrine support.
Due to his persistent pressor requriement and persistent leukocytosis, his antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and cefepime.
[**Hospital3 **] blood cultures were negative and urine culture grew 10-50,000 mixed gram positive flora.
Urine culture at [**Hospital1 18**] grew corynebacterium sp.
Given atypical organism causing UTI, ID was consulted.
CT abdomen/pelvis was also performed, which showed worsening metastatic disease as well as bladder wall stranding which could be inflammatory/infectious process.
Patient continued to spike fevers and repeat blood and urine cultures were sent.
*Urine cultures originally grew Corynebacteria for which pt took Cefepime for 10 days, completing a full course.
UA was sent which revealed many bacteria many WBCs.
There was concern for recurrent UTI as pt started have symptoms of dilirium and pt was restarted on antibiotics, Ceftriaxone.
# Acute kidney injury: The patient presented to [**Hospital3 **] with [**Last Name (un) **] that resolved rapidly with hydration.
A renal ultrasound performed there showed stable mild hydronephrosis.
CT abdomen and pelvis showed bilateral hydroureteronephrosis.
Urine electrolytes showed FENA of 1.5%, indeterminate for intrinsic process.
Given that pt's bump in creatinine occured at the same time pt was put on Cephalosporins, there was concern for Acute Interstial Nephritis.
# Metastatic bladder cancer: CT of abdomen and pelvis showed progression of disease, including increase in size of adrenal nodules, nodules in pelvis, lytic lesions at L2 (previously seen) and T11 and L3 (new).
Bladder collapsed with surrounding stranding read as infection vs. tumor infiltration.
Patient and his daughter understand his poor prognosis from his malignancy and would like to avoid aggressive treatment and focus on pain control and symptom management.
Pt some mornings thought he was in a football stadium and that it was Decemeber.
It seems there might be a fine line between managing pt's pain with narcotics adequately and allowing him to be mentally alert and oriented x 3.
However pt's mental status improved without any adjustment in pain regimen.
# Thrombocytopenia:  Patient with mild thrombocytopenia on admission (129) likely related to chemotherapy.
Differential included drug effect from vancomycin, so vanc was discontinued.
# Atrial fibrillation with tachy-brady syndrome: The patient was maintained on his home digoxin, but his metoprolol was held in the setting of his hypotension.
The patient had occasional episodes of tachycardia to the 120s.
He had no episodes of bradycardia.
On the floor, patient was persistantly tachy in the 100s-110s, with occasional episodes of tachy to the 120s-140s.
Tele showed frequent PVCs and occasional non-sustained (10 beats or less) runs of V-tach.
Echo during stay showed EF of 25% and ventricular dyssynchrony.
Patient did not show signs of volume overload.
# Anemia: The patient's anemia was thought to be related to chemotherapy.
He also had hematuria due to his bladder cancer throughout his stay.
He was transfused 1U PRBCs on two occasions with good resolution of symptoms and an appropriate increase in HCT.
# Diarrhea: Patient developed loose liquid stools the night before transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
Patient was found to be cdiff negative without bacterial pathogen, without fecal leukocytes.
After negative workup, it was felt that diarrhea was likely secondary to antibiotic use.
Care was taken to make up for insensible losses with fluid repletion.
Patient did have one guaiac positive stool which was thought to be brought on by this transient coagulopathy.
Transitional issues: - FEVERS: patient continued to have intermittent fevers to 101.5 in the days prior to discharge.
The source of his fevers was thought to be from his cancer.
Patient and his daughter elected not to have further aggressive treatment or work-up.
Phenazopyridine 200 mg PO Q8H:PRN bladder pain Duration: 3 Days 7.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID hold for loose stools 3.
Bisacodyl 10 mg PO/PR DAILY:PRN constipation   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 4542**] Rehabilitation and Nursing of [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: UTI with sepsis; metastatic bladder cancer; delirium   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You were found to have a urinary tract infection and were given IV fluids and antibiotics.
You also had severe back pain, most likely due to metastatic cancer in your spine, and your pain medications were adjusted.
You also had frequent fevers throughout your hospitalization.
We evaluated you for a source of infection but no source was located.
We discussed your goals of care and you would like to focus more on symptoms and feeling comfortable.
