The location is most unlikely to be associated with an aneurysmal hemorrhage.
Perhaps when the hemorrhage regresses, the gadolinium study would be of greater benefit in excluding an underlying mass lesion.
There was some concern for possible underlying amyloid angiopathy, but MRI evaluation was not strongly supportive of this diagnosis.
There was no AVM visualized by MRA.
He was admitted to the neuro ICU for close neurologic and hemodynamic monitoring.
His neurologic exam remained stable with slight right pronator drift.
Right facial droop.
He developed an acute episode of chest pain treated with nitrates, morphine and beta blocked.
He was restarted on full dose aspirin therapy for coronary and stroke prevention.
There is a risk of recurrent hemorrhage with the use of anticoagulation in the future especially if this is amyloid, but this needs to be weighted against his risk of thrombotic complication.
2) NSTEMI: In the ICU, After receiving the proplex, he developed a bump in his troponins which peaked at .31.
He was started on metoprolol but aspirin was not given as he had a large ICH.
Second episode of chest pain on the floors managed medically with full dose atorvastatin, metoprolol, nitrates, and aspirin.
He likely has unstable coronary plaque with need for PCI, but cannot undergo intervention given his cerebral hemorrhage.
4) Bilateral Carotid Artery Stnnosis- Carotid US revealed 70-70% stenosis bilaterally.
He was not symptomatic from this but should be followed for any symptoms and with carotid U/S q6months-1 year.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain.
Aluminum-Magnesium Hydroxide 225-200 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Fifteen (15) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for indigestion.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 979**] - [**Location (un) 246**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Left parietal intracranial hemorrhage Non ST elevation myocardial infarction Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Systolic heart dysfunction   Discharge Condition: Slight right facial droop.
