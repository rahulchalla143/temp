Seen by VNA and noted to be tachycardic and sent to [**Hospital3 7571**]for evaluation.
Now sent in to [**Location (un) **] by VNA because of asymptomatic sinus tachycardia.
Neurology evaluated pt and felt to have intact brainstem reflexes but poor prognosis.
Intubated for MS changes and lethargy and concern for airway protection.
This was followed by later development of lymphedema and left arm (distal>proximal) weakness due to metastatic disease in left axilla ensheathing nerve plexus.
Switched to Arimedex in [**11/2119**] due to vaginal bleeding on Tamoxifen.
No prior history of intracranial disease.
Metastatic disease in left arm, brachial plexus resulting in  left arm paresis, as above  Social History: Married, lives with husband.
No rebound or guarding.
Pertinent Results: Head CT There is diffuse metastatic disease.
Three discrete lesions are seen within the left frontal, right occipital, and left parietal lobes with significant surrounding vasogenic edema.
There is moderate surrounding edema with 10 mm rightward shift of the normally midline structures with associated mass effect on the lateral ventricles.
The basilar cistern is preserved and there is no uncal herniation.
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
Right middle lobe lung nodule, suspicious for metastatic disease.
Right upper lobe lung opacities which appear confluent, most suggestive of infectious etiology, however, cannot entirely exclude metastatic lesions.
Multiple hypodense liver lesions which are mildly enhancing, most consistent with metastatic disease.
Bilateral small pleural effusion, which certainly could be malignant given today's findings and history of breast cancer.
No evidence of bony metastases.
Pnuemonia - Possible aspiration.
