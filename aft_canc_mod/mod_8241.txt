Admission Date:  [**2118-6-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-6-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2045-10-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: morphine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**] Chief Complaint: GIB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Interventional Radiology embolization of R gastroepiploic artery 2 EGDs Secretin Stimulation Test  History of Present Illness: 72yo M with h/o prostate ca with bone mets on chemotherapy (taxotare) monthly and steroids (decadron) with chronic pain on Naprosyn at home, presented to [**Location (un) **] on the 17th with 48hrs of hematemesis and melena.
EGD showed ulcerative gastropathy with multiple ulcers but no active source of bleeding so no intervention.
These were felt [**1-12**] chronic steroids and naprosyn use.
On [**6-1**] another EGD showed an arterial bleed in the post-bulbar region.
It could not be clipped but was injected with epinephrine which stopped the bleeding at least intraporcdurally.
However, the patient was dizzy and hypotensive on [**6-2**].
Hematocrt found to be 17 so given more transfusions and went to the OR for an ex lap where they did a duodenectomy and oversewing over arterial bleed site in the ulcer.
Last episode of melena was the night prior to transfer.
He had a dilaudid pca but was not using it well (forgetting to hit the button) so was switched to fentanyl boluses (50-100mcg every couple of hours).
In addition he had a leukocytosis that was attributed to a leukamoid reaction from stress reaction from the GIB.
On the floor, patient was feeling ok. His only complaint was dry mouth and pain in the abdomen around his insertion site.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.

Blush but no active extravasation seen in the distal right gastroepiploic.
Gelfoam embolization of the distal right epiploic.
No active extravasation seen from the GDA, inferior hepatic pancreaticoduodenal or visualized branches of the SMA.
Pathology: DIAGNOSIS:  Gastric ulcer: Fundal mucosa with focal chronic inactive inflammation; multiple levels taken.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] notified [**2118-6-11**], 10:55 a.m. with diagnosis of unremarkable fundal mucosa---"will do levels and cytomegalovirus stain".
It consists of multiple tissue fragments measuring up to 0.3 cm entirely submitted in cassette A.  EGD Report [**2118-6-16**] Blood in the fundus and cardia Ulcers in the stomach body (biopsy) Oversewn Duodenal Ulcer seen, with protruding sutures.
No active bleeding seen from this site.
Ulcer in the second part of the duodenum Erythema and congestion in the duodenum There was intermittent fresh blood in duodenum noted.
A large clot in the fundus/cardia could not be washed off and may have obscured a source of bleeding.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  EGD Report [**2118-6-10**] 2 esophagitis in the distal compatible with erosive esophagitis (injection) Punctate erythema in the stomach compatible with gastritis Ulcers in the body (injection) Erythema in the bulb compatible with duodenitis Ulcer in the 11 0clock Ulcer in the duodenal bulb - suture material present Polyp in the distal duodenum beyond ampulla Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  [**2118-6-22**] 05:54AM BLOOD WBC-5.7 RBC-2.73* Hgb-8.5* Hct-25.0* MCV-92 MCH-31.2 MCHC-34.1 RDW-15.2 Plt Ct-283 [**2118-6-23**] 05:32AM BLOOD WBC-5.7 RBC-2.73* Hgb-8.4* Hct-25.7* MCV-94 MCH-30.7 MCHC-32.5 RDW-15.3 Plt Ct-304  Brief Hospital Course: 72 yo M with h/o prostate cancer with bone mets, HTN transferred from outside hospital for upper GI bleed s/p duodenectomy with continued upper GI bleed  #  GI Bleed: He was initially admitted to the ICU on [**6-4**] and was noted to have about 220ccs of bright red blood from his NG tube.
After transfer to the floor, Hct was 24 but Hct continued to slowly trend down and he was noted to have liquid black stool, so he was made NPO once again and received several transfusions with 2 units per day for several days.
EGD was performed on Also was noted to have liquid black stool, so had an EGD on [**6-10**] that showed fresh blood but no source of active bleeding.
EGD showed erosive esophagitis, which was injected with epinephrine, gastritis, and multiple ulcers, and a bleeding sessile polyp in the duodenum (which was not biopsied).
After this EGD, pt continued to have occasional melena however Hgb and Hct remained stable around 25-26.
He will be discharged to an LTACH where he will continue to have daily Hct checks.
# Ulcer/bleeding workup: Given numerous bleed sources and multiple ulcers, workup was performed for Zollinger [**Doctor Last Name 9480**] syndrome with serum gastrin level, which was normal, but given high suspicion secretin stimulation test was done which is still pending on discharge.
Biopsy of ulcer was performed that showed no evidence of malignancy and was negative for H. pylori.
Heme/onc service was consulted as well for workup of possible bleeding diathesis, vWF, factor XIII, bleeding time, fibrinogen all within or near normal limits and thought not to have bleeding disorder by the heme/onc team.
Patient took only one dose of naproxen and denied other NSAID use prior to admission, so this is unlikely to be source of multiple ulcers.
# Pain control/ s/p duodenectomy:  Patient had duodenectomy and ex lap on [**6-1**] at outside hospital.
# Hypertension: Initially home lisinopril was held given active GI bleed, but was restarted at low dose during admission.
When the patient arrived to the floor he continued to be very edematous from the continued transfusions he required.
We continued to monitor his fluid status as well as his vitals which remained stable during the rest of this admission, however pt was given several doses of IV lasix on the floor for symptomatic relief given anasarca.
# Leukamoid reaction: Patient was on decadron but WBC count has trended upward to a peak of 32.
Per OSH records they felt this was [**1-12**] stress reaction from GIB.
Patient also had asymptomatic bacteriuria with ESBL growing from catheterized urine during ICU course, was not treated given no symptoms or fever.
# Presumed acute renal failure: Unknown baseline but patient had creatinine up to 2.3 at OSH presumed [**1-12**] hypotension/hypovolemia.
# Neck Abscess: treated at OSH, on admission was treated with wet-dry dressings  # Prostate CA complicated by bone mets: Held naproxen and steroids given acute GI bleed, although patient denied taking any NSAIDS except for one single dose of naproxen prior to admission.
# DM blood glucose was well-controlled on ISS along with regular insulin in TPN  # HL: initally statin was held, restarted when able to take PO  # Depression: prozac was held initially while patient was NPO then restarted once diet was advanced.
