His cancer has been unresponsive to chemotherapy, and he has been speaking with palliative care about transitioning to hospice.
The morning of admission, the patient presented to the OSH with nausea, vomiting, and a distended abdomen.
KUB was suggestive of obstructive.
CXR was without free air under the diaphragm.
CT abdomen showed marked interval progression of pancreatic mass 18.9 x 14.9 cm, (9.1 x 8.8 cm previous), with concerns for obstruction of duodenum and stomach.
No SBO or large bowel obstruction.
Ddx included contained perforation vs necrotic mass vs less likely air in collapsed bowel.
He also had new large amt of ascites.
Increased + new hepatic mets.
Surgery was also consulted, who contemplated performing laparoscopic PEG placement for decompression.
Currently,  the patient has abdominal pain and back pain.
Denies fevers or chills.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  The patient presented with 2 months of abdominal pain and was admitted to [**Hospital1 1170**] from [**2176-3-19**] through [**2176-3-22**] after initial evaluation at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital where he was found to have a large pancreatic mass on CT scan.
During his hospitalization, he underwent EGD, EUS with FNA of the pancreatic mass on [**3-21**] which is consistent with adenocarcinoma.
FNA of the peripancreatic lymph node was negative for malignant cells.
His imaging from outside details a 7.7 cm pancreatic body and tail mass extending into the spleen, stomach, left adrenal gland, and small bowel.
His pain was treated with MS Contin, MSIR, and he was discharged in stable condition.
Abdominal CT on [**2176-7-17**] showed interval progression of the pancreatic adenocarcinoma involving the distal body and tail, as compared to the [**2176-5-22**] examination.
There was noted new rightward mass effect and loss of fat plane against the SMA, worsening encasement of the splenic artery, aggressive invasion into the adjacent duodenum and greater curvature of the stomach, and obscuration of the fat plane against the spleen posteriorly.
There was also an unchanged segment [**Doctor First Name 690**] liver lesion, concerning for metastatic focus.
Other Medical History: Hypertension Type 2 Diabetes [**Name (NI) **] PTSD Depression Insomnia Headaches related to head trauma  Social History: [**Country 3992**] War veteran with PTSD and h/o multiple head injuries from parachuting.
Family History: No h/o GI malignancy or other CA.
No family history of DM or CAD.
No wheezes or crackles.
No rebound or guarding.
No palpable masses.
LIMBS: 3+ LE edema, no tremors or asterixis, no clubbing SKIN: No rashes or skin breakdown NEURO: A+O x3.
Interval placement of nasogastric tube, with distal tip in the expected location of the stomach, but with side port at the GE junction.
Low lung volumes without focal consolidation or pulmonary edema seen.
Lucency under the left hemidiaphragm seen on the prior radiograph at outside hospital is no longer appreciated, status post NG placement and most likely represented distended gastric bubble.
Marked interval disease progression, including substantial interval increase in size of pancreatic mass, as above, which invades the stomach, duodenum, left adrenal gland, and likely the splenic flexure, encases at least the splenic, hepatic, and distal celiac arteries, the splenic vein and SMV, and at least abuts and likely invades the left renal vein.
Increased retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
Peritoneal/omental thickening and nodularity.
Contrast seen in the stomach and duodenum, possibly to the level of the duodenal stent without contrast seen more distally.
Findings are highly concerning for obstruction, possibly at the level of the duodenum due to the large pancreatic mass.
No evidence of large bowel obstruction or obstruction of the small bowel distal to the duodenal stent.
Small foci of gas adjacent to the duodenal stent amongst the large pancreatic mass.
Differential diagnosis includes bowel perforation versus necrotic mass versus much less likely air within collapsed loops of bowel amongst the pancreatic mass.
Interval development of large amount of abdominal/pelvic ascites, which can be seen in metastatic disease and in bowel perforation.
Left periureteral stranding.

Duodenal and Gastric Obstruction: The patient was admitted with several days of nausea and vomiting.
A KUB performed at an OSH was concerning for obstruction and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
A CT scan on admission was concerning for marked interval progression of pancreatic mass obstructing his duodenum and stomach.
The patient was initially treated with antibiotics due to concern for perforation.
Acute renal failure: Creatinine on admission was increased to 1.4 from a a baseline of 0.6 which improved with intravenous hydration.
No further evaluation was sought and the patient received no transfusions.
Coagulopathy: INR 1.8 was elevated on admission which was likely due to hepatic metastases as well as nutritional deficiencies.
