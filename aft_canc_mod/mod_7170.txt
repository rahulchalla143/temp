The patient reports having intermittent, persistent lower abdominal pain.
She thinks that her bowel movements have decreased in frequency since being started on antibiotics for her Cdiff, but she is unsure.
The patient is also reporting some RUQ abdominal pain which she says is  new and different than her lower abdominal pain.
Reports that this pain just started today.
Of note, imaging during his last admission was notable for GB dilatation and sludge on RUQ u/s.
On ROS, denies any fevers/chills, denies any chest pain/shortness of breath.
No blood in stool, denies any urinary symptoms.
The patient's exam was pertinent for generalized abdominla pain, with RUQ tenderness and +  [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign.
RUQ u/s was done --> e/o  increasing GB and biliary distension.
GB wall edema and probable US [**Doctor Last Name **] sign.
Superimposed acute cholecystitis and cholangitis are not excluded.
History of Lyme disease.
Depression  PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 1.
She became an attorney at age 55, retiring at age 70.
Mother had diabetes and died of myocardial infarction.
Father had myocardial infarction, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension.
She had a sister who died of metastatic breast cancer.
Physical Exam: Admission PE: VS: 98.2 116/70 86 16 93 RA General: pleasant, well appearing elderly female, NAD, laying comfortably in bed HEENT: dry mucous membranes CV: 2/6 SEM heard loudest at LUSB lungs: clear to ausculation b/l, no wheezes/rhonchi/crackles abdomen: +RUQ tenderness, did not appreciated +[**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign, mild lower abdominal tenderness, no rebound or guarding, +BS extremities: warm, well perfused, no LE edema, 2+ DP pulses Neuro: alert, interactive, and appropriate, normal muscle strength and sensation throughout  Discharge: Vitals:  98.1  130/80   60  18  94  RA General: NAD, calm CV: RRR, no MRG Lungs: crackles at bases B/L Abdomen: soft, nontender, no guarding or rigidity, per chole tube in place with dark bile.
Increasingly distended gallbladder, with wall edema and pericholecystic fluid.
Review of prior CT shows a rounded filling defect in the distal CBD, suggesting an obstructing mass.
Given patient presentation, superimposed acute cholecystitis and cholangitis are not excluded.
MRCP or ERCP would be more sensitive for evaluation.
[**2144-4-14**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis: Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.
There is atelectasis involving the lower lobes bilaterally.
There is no ascites.
The liver is without focal lesions; however, there is intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
In the upper pole of the left kidney, there is a 1.2-cm hypodense lesion that measures 42 Hounsfield units and is indeterminate by CT criteria.
Two too small to characterize hypodense lesions are seen in the left kidney in the lower pole and a 1.5-cm hypodense lesion in the right lower pole measures 26 Hounsfield units.
There is no hydronephrosis.
There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
There is massive wall thickening of the colon involving the ascending, transverse and descending colon.
There is severe adjacent fat stranding.
There is no evidence for extraluminal air or focal fluid collection.
There is a small amount of ascites in the pelvis.
There is no extraluminal air or focal fluid collection.
On bone windows, there are extensive degenerative changes involving the lumbar spine.
There is loss of height in L1 through L3 and this is stable in appearance.
There is some disruption in the mucosal enhancement which raises concern for gangrenous cholecystitis.
Severe colitis extending from the sigmoid colon to the cecum.
The imaging appearance is consistent with C. diff colitis, although other etiologies such as inflammatory or ischemic processes cannot be excluded.
There is currently no evidence for perforation.
No abscess is identified.
New ascites and bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
Biliary obstruction at the level of the head of the pancreas.
An obstructing mass is not visualized, and this may be due to an obstructing stone.
Bilateral renal lesions cannot be classified as simple cysts, but may be proteinaceous cysts.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**11-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
At least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

# Sepsis / C. Diff colitis / acaculus cholecystitis: Source is most likely C.diff colitis, with additional source of possible acaculus cholecystitis.
Patient had CT scan after arrival to ICU showing pancolitis, ascites, and dialated gallbladder with pericholecystic fluid.
Patient continued to have improving abdominal exam and leukocytosis suggesting C.diff is improving.
Infectious disease team was consulted and they recommended continued ceftriaxone for her biliary process until [**2144-4-27**] which was done.
# Delerium: Patient had intermittent delerium in ICU, mostly in evening.
Likely multifactorial, secondary to sepsis, sedating/deleriogenic medications (versed fentanyl) given during the percutaneous gallbladder drain, and altered sleep wake cycle.
She received seroquel PRN agitation while in ICU.
# Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate: Paroxsysmal and new since MICU admission.
Anticoagulation with coumadin was also held given patient's possible need for surgery.
# Parkinson's disease: The patient was continued on her home Carbidopa-Levodopa.
