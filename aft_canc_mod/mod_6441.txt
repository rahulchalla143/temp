Admission Date:  [**2101-6-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-6-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2043-2-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3016**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath, bloody stool  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Foley catheter placement   History of Present Illness: 58 year old male with widely metastatic (including an infiltrating mass in his stomach) melenoma unresponsive to IL-2, s/p cycle 1 dacarbazine [**5-11**], admitted from the ED after reporting to an OSH with complaints of acute dyspnea.
At that time, he noted that at the top of his spiral stairs, he became acutely SOB and fell to the floor.
He was scheduled to see his oncologist for taxol infusion today, but this happened again so he was instructed to present to an OSH, where he was noted to have melena and a HCT of 24.
He denies any change of his chronic fevers and nightsweats.
He denies change in his cough and he denies hemoptysis.
He has no dysuria.
He also says he had constipation with no bowel movement for about 4 days.
He was admitted for worsening dyspnea and ongoing upper GI bleed.
He was initially admitted to the MICU where he was determined to be HD stable and was treated supportively for his dyspnea, fatigue, RUQ pain (from liver mets), N/V.
His dyspnea was felt to be [**2-22**] to his metastatic melanoma and he was found to have a left mainstem endobornchial tumor.
He was felt to have a slow upper GI bleed, was transfused one unit prior to discharge (HCT on d/c was 25) and he was continued on his home PPI.
He also had low grade fevers during his stay with no clear souce for infection, but because of a possibility of post-obstructive pna, he was given an 8 day course of levofloxacin.
He denied hemoptysis or trouble breathing above his recent DOE.
They saw him upon arrival and felt that he did not need an EGD at this time both because it is unlikely he has a brisk bleed at this point and there would be little to do for a slow bleed from the implanted tumor.
Past Medical History: HTN COPD - used albuterol inhaler Metastatic Melenoma: symptoms [**12-29**] melena DX:[**2-4**] after UGI Bleed when endoscopy showed gastric mass, 2 moles on back bx and confirmed as melenoma.
STAGING: CT Torso - multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules with a dominant mass in the LLL.
PET-CT on [**2101-2-21**] was notable for FDG-avid adenopathy in the mediastinum and left suprahilar region, multiple bilateral lung nodules, multiple liver lesions, a lymph node adjacent to the pancreatic head, and an "extremely" avid lesion in the greater curvature of the mid-body of the stomach.
There was also FDG avidity in C2/C3 posterior elements, the right medial ilium, and the left inferior pubic ramus.
Limited by acute renal failure and dyspnea.
Prior to illness was the call center manager of a catalog company.
CV: tachy, no m/r/g.
right lung clear with no w/r/r.
Abd: multiple hard nodules throughout abdomen.
Mild diffuse TTP without rebound/guarding.
No wheezing/rhonchi/rales Abd: Palpable hard nodules diffusely spread across abdomen.
CN2-12 grossly intact.
CXR [**2101-6-7**]: IMPRESSION: Interval nearly resolution of previously noted left-sided pleural effusion with improved aeration of the left lung base.
Probable lymphangitic spread of tumor within the left lung.
ECHO [**2101-6-8**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a very small/minimal pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Dyspnea/fatigue: On previous admission, his worsening dyspnea was felt to be due to his metastatic melanoma and he underwent debridement of his tumor (no stent).
His dyspnea acutely worsened 3-4 days prior to this admission and was accompanied by platypnea.
Etiology for his dyspnea could include worsening of his pulmonary metastatic disease (CXR improved from previous in terms of his pulm effusion); pneumonia (CXR improved, no leukocytosis, currently afebrile); cardiac sources including MI (though EKG baseline and no CP); pericardial effusion (no rub, ECHO at OSH 3 weeks ago reportedly without effusion); shunt including vascular abnormalities related to tumor, AVMs, or PE.
His improvement while laying with his good side down also suggests V/Q mismatch from pulmonary disease or pulmonary embolism.
However, he does not actually desaturate when he sits up, suggesting extrathoracic compression may cause some of his dyspnea, this degree of acute symptoms would be unusual.
Echo obtained [**6-8**] did not reveal any additional valvular or dynamic abnormalities to explain his dyspnea.
Did not pursue CTA given no O2 requirement and would likely not be able to anticoagulate given GI bleed.
Patient remained unable to engage in very much physical therapy secondary to dyspnea on exertion, but continued to saturate appropriately while in bed, on room air.
Patient does become symptomatic with slight dips in Hct, so he was aggressively transfused.
UGI Bleed: He has a known melenoma metastasis eroding into his stomch lining.
GI was contact[**Name (NI) **] but did not think that he had a brisk bleed.
EGD would not be helpful if the bleed is related to his metastasis to his stomach (likely).
Patient was transferred to the floor where he had 3-4 episodes of coffee ground emesis.
He received another unit of pRBC for symptomatic relief (dyspnea) in-house.
- If HD change or evidence of brisk bleed, GI to do emergent scope for possible source other than tumor - Continue Omeprazole 40mg twice daily for acid reflux and stomach ulcers - Continue Sucralfate 10-15mL four times daily to protect against the stomach ulcers - Continue Zofran and Compazine as needed for nausea/vomiting control .
Tachycardia: He has persistent tachycardia felt to be due to underlying malignancy and pulmonary stimuli.
He was ruled out for PE on OSH CTA and had no effusion on OSH Echo prior to last admission.
Likely this is no change from his recent baseline rates.
Primary cardiac etiology including effusion or cardiomyopathy could be present, but less likely.
ECHO without structural explanation.
Metastatic Melenoma: Widely metastatic.
Fever: Reports continued low grade fevers.
Fever most likely related to underlying malignancy.
# Urinary obstruction: Noted to have difficulty with urination [**6-8**] with complete inablity on [**6-9**].
No saddle anesthesia and good rectal tone but with enlarged prostate.
Patient was started on tamsulosin for BPH with improvement of his symptoms.
# Constipation: Patient complained of poor stool frequency prior to hospitalization (no bowel movement since [**6-7**]).
Physical exam with mildly hypoactive bowel tones intially but normalized.
He subsequently had multiple liquid bowel movements that were CDiff negative and resolved with decreasing frequency of bowel regimen.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospice House  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Metastatic melanoma causing dyspnea and upper GI bleed Secondary: Hypertension, COPD   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: -You were admitted with significant shortness of breath.
This was felt likely due to the spread of your melanoma to your lungs.
Your breathing is also sensitive to low red blood cell counts (anemia); your anemia is caused by the metastasis of your cancer eroding your stomach lining.
Your breathing was closely monitored and you were started on medications to decrease vomiting, protect your stomach lining.
We made the following changes to your medications during this admission: --> START Tamsulosin 0.4mg before bed for your enlarged prostate --> START Sucralfate 10-15mL four times daily to protect your stomach ulcers --> START Omeprazole 40mg twice daily for acid reflux and stomach ulcers --> START Zofran and Compazine as needed for nausea --> START Lorazepam as needed for anxiety --> Morphine, Lorazepam and Atropine solutions will be provided for your comfort .
Also seek medical attention if you develop any new fever, chills, trouble breathing, chest pain, nausea, vomiting or unusual stools.
