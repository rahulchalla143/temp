She was d/c'ed prior to final read of a f/u echo, which showed increased size of the effusion.
Incidentally, pt had hematemesis x3 on that day as well.
Her acute cardiac issues had resolved and she was called out to the medicine service.
On the day of transfer to medicine, pt's creat (b/l 1.1) had risen to 2.0, despite stent placement, prompting a Renal consult.

AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
No significant respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve flows.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is a moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion extending 2.4cm inferior and 2cm lateral to the left ventricle, but <1cm around the apex and anterior to the right ventricle.
There is brief right atrial and left atrial diastolic collapse without eccentuation of transmitral E wave velocities.
Chronic pulmonary embolism in the right lung.
Large bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Large pericardial effusion.
Pleural fluid cytology: Rare atypical epithelioid cells present.
Scattered mesothelial cells and numerous lymphocytes.
Pericardial fluid cytology: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Renal U/S [**2199-5-14**]: Small kidneys bilaterally with normal arterial and venous waveforms.
Large volume ascites is noted.
Renal parenchymal disease of the right kidney with no evidence of obstruction.
Partial obstruction of the left kidney.
Superimposed renal parenchymal disease of the left kidney cannot be excluded.
CXR [**2199-5-15**]: Resolution of previously seen apical pneumothorax on the left.
Unchanged appearance of bibasilar patchy atelectasis/consolidation.
Pericardial effusion: Pt was found to have a new pericardial effusion on Echo, was seen by thoracic surgery, and underwent thorascopic pericardial window with chest tube insertion.
She was noted to have 100cc of serosanguinous fluid drained from the pericardium itself, along with 500cc of pleural fluid.
Both fluids were sent for cytology, with the pleural fluid noted to contain atypical cells concerning for malignancy and the pericardial fluid devoid of atypical cells.
She had a repeat echo, which showed a small pocket of apical fluid collection and resolution of the larger pericardial effusion.
Oncology noted that the patient could be followed as an outpatient for further management of the pleural malignancy.
The chest tube was pulled without complications.
Further workup of the GI bleed can be done as an outpatient.
Chronic PE: As above, the patient was placed on the heparin drip for 1 day for concern of PE/DVT, but as she had an IVC filter placed this drip was discontinued.
Her creatinine levels started to rise, and the etiology of her renal failure remained elusive.
However, her urine output remained low post-procedure.
Urine lytes were sent, with FeNa of 1.5% indicating intrinsic renal or post-renal disease.
Renal artery u/s was done to evaluate for concerns of IVC obstruction of the renal arteries as an etiology of the ARF--pre-renal that eventually became ATN; however, this showed normal arterial and venous flow.
Both kidneys were noted be small, measuring 9.0cm R and 9.1cm L, suggesting bilateral intrinsic disease.
They felt that, as her creat was rising despite the recent R ureteral stent, pt likely had bilateral disease.
As she was never HD unstable to suggest possible renal ischemia, and there were no muddy brown casts on urine sedment exam, ATN was unlikely.
Urology was consulted and recommended a nuclear scan of the kidneys, which showed a possible L-sided obstruction.
Pt was taken to the OR for cystoscopy, left retrograde pyelogram and insertion of left double-J stent.
Urology instructed the pt that the stent would have to be changed in 3 months and that it would increase irritability of the bladder and that she may have chronic hematuria, requiring transfusion.
PNA: The patient was febrile on arrival to the CCU, and remained febrile overnight.
The etiology was initially attributed to atelectasis/post-OP fever, but repeat CXR showed RLL haziness concerning for PNA (pt also had an elevated WBC).
Given the clinical concerns, she was started on levo for community-acquired PNA on [**5-9**], which was changed to azithro/CTX on [**5-13**] (see above).
Likely [**2-6**] nutritional deficiency as pt w/low albumin and poor PO intake.
Vitamin K was held, given no evidence of bleeding; however, she receievd FFP prior to stent placement.
Malnutrition: The patient was noted to have a large amount of third spacing, as above, with a low albumin.
The persistently elevated INR despite being off coumadin for days raised the concern for malnutrition (protein deficiency).
Metastatic cervical cancer: Underlying cause for all of her current acute issues.
9) Dispo: Pt was discharged home with services once her creatinine was decreasing and she was afebrile and HD stable.
