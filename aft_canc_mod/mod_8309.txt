There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akineis of the distal 2/3rds of the septum and anterior walls, distal inferior and lateral walls.
The apex is mildly aneurysmal and dyskinetic.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Apical left vevntricular aneurysm with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
No left ventricular thrombi.
Regional right ventricular free wall hypokinesis c/w CAD.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for which the patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE inhibitor or [**Last Name (un) **].
[**7-4**] Cardiac perfusion persantine  RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:    11.0 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m Sestamibi Rest ([**2141-7-4**]);    29.6 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Stress ([**2141-7-4**]); HISTORY: 85 year old male with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, permanent atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease who had a recent missed STEMI.
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a focal anteroseptal wall defect which shows improvement at rest.
Gated images reveal global hypokinesia.
IMPRESSION:  1- Focal anteroseptal wall defect which shows improvement at rest suggesting persantine induced ischemia.
2- Enlarged left ventricular cavity and global hypokinesia.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 112282**] is 85M with history of CKD, HTN, HLD, afib on coumadin, PUD s/p UGIB [**1-/2141**] who is presented with chest pain and new EKG changes, found to have elevated troponins and guaic positive stool, with peaked troponins and CK-Mb thought to have a missed antero-septal MI.
ACUTE ISSUES #Antero-septal MI:  The patient was noted to have chest pain the day of presentation and was later found to have ST elevations in V1-2, with loss of R waves in V1-V3 in the setting also having an elevated troponin.
An ECHO was obtained with h/o regional systolic dysfunction.
Given the patient was chest pain free at this time the infarct was thought to be completed and there was no angiography performed.
ACEI was initially held in the setting of acute on chronic kidney disease (K at 5.3), but after normalization captopril added back on to regimen and then changed to lisinopril.
Diuresis was started on [**7-2**] as he thought to be mildly volume overloaded.
During the stay he was monitored on tele for any arrhythmic complications of MI and any mechanical complications with close following of his vital signs and clinical impression.
He had an echo on [**7-3**] which showed EF 25% Apical left vevntricular aneurysm with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
No left ventricular thrombi.
Regional right ventricular free wall hypokinesis c/w CAD.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
At the beginning of hospital stay we did treat him for systolic failure with some lasix and toward the end of hospital stay he had no crackles.
The results showed Focal anteroseptal wall defect which shows improvement at rest suggesting persantine induced ischemia.Enlarged left ventricular cavity and global hypokinesia.
Calculated LVEF of 24% We told him many times that if he has chest pain to call 911 right away  # rhythm: The patient has history of afib, rate controlled on atenolol and anticoagulated with couamdin at home.
Warfarin was initially held as evidence of GI bleed but we resumed this medication after decreased concern for an active bleed.
# PUD s/p UGIB:  The patient has a history of erosive gastritis, erosive duodenitis, hiatal hernia, and duodenal ulcer, with UGIB in 2/[**2140**].
On day of discharge his Cr was 1.6, his baseline  #Hyperkalemia: when admitted patient had a K in the 5s.
We started him on K-sparing medications like lisinopril because it is a good medication for post MI patients and told him to eat a low potassium diet, to avoid potassium [**Doctor First Name **] foods.
Sent pt on very low dose lisinopril (1.125)  #Thrombocytosis: Patient has elevated platlets in the 700s.
Our differential was reactive thrombocytosis vs essential thrombocytosis.
While here the team looked at the smear and saw lots of platelets, some basophils, looks like possibly myeloproliferative disorder such as essential thrombocytosis.
CHRONIC ISSUES # glaucoma:continued  home latanoprost  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -Cards: pt will follow up with cardiologist in outpatient setting regarding anterior MI and now low EF 25%.
Pt came in with an elevated K in the 5s, K should be followed up in outpatient setting especially because pt is on an ACE-i.
In outpatient setting may consider starting aldosterone antagonist at some point, however his K should beb monitored, also may consider ICD placement after 40 days of MI (in [**Month (only) **]).
You came to the hospital because you had some chest discomfort and were found to have a heart attack.
We did not do any intervention because when you were here the heart attack was already resolving which means you likely came in when the heart attack had already almost passed because you no longer had chest discomfort.
We also didn't do any procedures like place a stent in your heart vessel because we were concerned you may have had a GI bleed.
We watched you while you were here to make sure you didnt have any complication from a heart attack and you did great.
While you were here you were also found to have blood in your stool.
This is likely from your known peptic ulcer disease.
If you feel chest pain please call 911 right away  please get your BLOOD DRAWN on Saturday [**2141-7-8**] for your INR to be checked.
We made the following changes to your medications: please STOP atenolol please START metoprolol - this is a good medication for patients who have had a heart attack please START aspirin 81 please START lisinopril 2.5 (this is in place of enalapril) please START pantoprazole this is for your peptic ulcer disease  We CHANGED your dose of warfarin to 4 (at home it was 5) because we were initially concerned you may have a GI bleed.
