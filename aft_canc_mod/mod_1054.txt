Admission Date:  [**2153-12-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2153-12-24**]  Date of Birth:   [**2092-5-30**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  No medical history until [**2153-9-15**] when she presented to her primary care physician with complaints of right upper and lower extremity weakness of approximately three weeks duration.
An MRI done at an outside hospital on [**2153-10-11**], reportedly showed four enhancing lesions (lesion #1 is the largest lesion, measuring approximately 14 mm X 14 mm X 8.0 mm in the left thalamic region with surrounding edema extending to the left mid brain with compression.)
At that time the patient had no pulmonary complaints, but a chest x-ray on [**10-11**], demonstrated a right upper lobe lesion with a question of mediastinal adenopathy and a chest CT scan performed the next day revealed a 3.7 cm X 2.4 cm right upper lobe mass with right hilar, precarinal lymphadenopathy.
On repeat bronchoscopy, there are clusters of atypical glandular cells, suspicious for adenocarcinoma.
Mammography demonstrated two lesions on the right breast.
A chest CT scan demonstrated a right upper lobe mass, but no mediastinal lymphadenopathy and low attenuation lesions of the liver, suspicious for primary lung carcinoma.
The procedure was complicated by a small persistent right apical pneumothorax.
Her head turned to the right side and she had a generalized tonoclonic seizure for at least several seconds.
The patient's husband could not recall the duration of seizure activity.
The patient and her husband, who witnessed the seizure, denied any urinary or bowel incontinence.
She apparently had a second seizure while in the CT scan room.
She had no further seizure activity while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
No other medications.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The neck was supple without lymphadenopathy.
The heart was regular in rate and rhythm, there were normal first and second heart sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
The lungs had decreased breath sounds diffusely, but no crackles or wheezes were appreciated.
There was a poor inspiratory effort.
No lymph nodes were appreciated.
Muscle tone was markedly increased in the right lower extremity.
The head without contrast on [**12-19**] demonstrated a 13 mm X 18 mm mass with high attenuation in the left frontal lobe with associated edema, extending to the cerebral peduncle.
No frank hemorrhage or midline shift was appreciated.
X-ray demonstrated a small apical pneumothorax post lung biopsy, which is unchanged from the previous x-ray two days ago.
Pathology per the lung biopsy came back positive for a non-small cell adenocarcinoma.
She was started on Decadron and Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis and reduction of cerebral edema associated with her metastatic disease.
It was thought that her initial decline in mental status was due to the combination of the high dose of intravenous Ativan she received immediately following her seizure and the effects of cerebral edema.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Metastatic non-small cell adenocarcinoma.
