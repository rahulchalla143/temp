She describes the pain as crampy and colicky.
Resuscitated in the ED she was brought to surgery after CAT scan revealed an internal hernia with swirling mesenteric suggestive of an ischemic area.
Rt breast cancer s/p lumpectomy in [**2135**]; no XRT or chemotherapy.
Multifocal atrial tachycardia vs sinus tach with atrial ectopy diagnosed [**7-/2140**]   Social History: Russian immigrant who lives near to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**Location (un) **].
CV: RRR, no murmur/R/G GI: soft, + distended, + BS, diffuse mild tenderness.
Neuro: grossly intact  Pertinent Results: CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2140-9-29**] 8:07 AM  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  Reason: Eval obstruction, diverticulitis, volvulus, other intraabdom  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 72 year old woman with h/o lymphoma, small bowel perf w/p resection w/ abdominal pain, N/V, ?
INDICATION: 72-year-old woman with history of lymphoma, small bowel perforation with resection.
The liver again demonstrates multiple low attenuation lesions, which are unchanged in size or appearance compared to the previous study.
The left kidney again demonstrates a caliceal diverticulum which is unchanged in appearance compared to the previous study.
Also seen is the previously identified low attenuation lesion at the upper pole of the left kidney which appears unchanged.
Retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is again visualized with a conglomerate of lymph nodes in series 2, image 41 measuring 24 x 9 mm.
Contrast is seen passing through the first site of small bowel anastomosis, however, the small bowel at this level appears dilated, with a transition point seen distal to the first anastamosis in series 2, image 57.
The small bowel distal to this transition point is markedly dilated and fluid filled without contrast seen within the lumen.
Another transition point is seen distal to this dilated loop of bowel in series 2, images 60 and the small bowel distal to this transition point is fully collapsed.
The second site of small bowel anastomosis is distal to the second transition point and is collapsed.
Significant free fluid is seen within the abdomen.
No free air is identified.
Free fluid is identified within the pelvis although the rim enhancing fluid collection may appear smaller.
No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are seen within the pelvis.
Post-surgical changes of the ventral abdominal wall are again identified.
Osseous structures again reveal degenerative changes and a Grade II anterolisthesis of L4 onto L5.
The second small bowel anastomosis is distal to the obstruction.
No bowel wall thickening or pneumatosis of the small bowel is seen.
Significant free fluid is seen within the abdomen.
ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  [**2140-9-29**] 4:42 AM  ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  Reason: r/o SBO  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 72 year old woman with abd pain, Hx operation REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o SBO INDICATION: 72-year-old with history of prior operations with severe abdominal pain, rule out small bowel obstruction.
There are multiple dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels.
Small amount of distal air within the ascending colon but a paucity more distal to this.
IMPRESSION: Multiple dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels, suspicious for small bowel obstruction.
No definite free intraperitoneal air, however, the regions under the diaphragms are suboptimally evaluated.
If there is high suspicion for small bowel obstruction, CT may provide a more accurate assessment.
Her pain was well controlled and her urine output was adequate.
She was confused at times, but able to be redirected.
She complained of decreased appetite.
She was switched to PO pain meds.
Her incisions were clean, dry, and intact without drainage or redness.
Phlebitis: She was noted to have a phlebitic left forearm that responded to ABX and hot packs.
