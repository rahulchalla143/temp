PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for smoking.
Prenatal history significant for ultrasound findings of 2-vessel umbilical cord, intraabdominal calcification, cardiomegaly and polyhydramnios (AFI 21.8 on [**5-25**]).
Cesarean section for poor fetal tracing.
Rupture of membranes approximately 14 hours prior to delivery for clear fluid.
No maternal temperature.
The patient emerged vigorous, dried, suctioned, spontaneous breathing with good respiratory effort and pink.
No obvious dysmorphism.
No neck mass.
Abdomen soft and active.
Active sucking, positive Moro, sacral dimple present.
EXTREMITIES: Without deformities.
He never received methylxanthine therapy for apnea bradycardia of prematurity as they were infrequent.
His last documented apnea bradycardiac episode at rest was on [**2145-6-23**].
Bilateral superior vena cava.
No significant atrioventricular valve regurgitation, large ductus arteriosus with qualitatively good biventricular function.
GASTROINTESTINAL/ GENITOURINARY: Abdominal ultrasound performed on day of admission revealed infant with anomalous veins within the liver with small main portal vein, middle and left hepatic vein draining into the right and left portal veins, normal kidneys, normal pancreas, spleen, normal aorta, and IVC.
He is at risk for liver failure from the absent portal vein, but at this point the collaterals appear to be functioning so that he may do well.
These should be monitored periodically to rule out impending liver failure - approx every 2-3 weeks.
The infant has had no further issues of sepsis during this hospital course.
Portal vein atresia with collateral blood flow, at risk for liver failure.
Bilateral superior vena cava.
