There is basilar atelectasis.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
The aorta is somewhat ectatic.
There are surgical clips at the GE junction, likely due to previous fundoplication.
There are calcified splenic granulomas and surgical clips in the left upper quadrant.
Imp: No acute intrathoracic process.
CT Abd/Pelvis without contrast [**11-7**]: Long segment of abnormally thickened right sided distal small bowel proximal to colonic pelvic anastomosis.
dx includes ischemia, as well as infection/inflammatory  CT abd/pelvis with po and IV contrast [**11-10**] - Mild decrease in the thickening of the small bowel loops in the right abdomen.
No perforation or abscess.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Fevers/abdominal pain: Presented with fevers and R sided abdominal pain.
CT abd/pelvis without contrast revealed thickening of the small bowel prior to the anastamosis site as well as surrounding inflammatory changes.
Surgery was consulted who felt that findings were unlikely secondary to anastomotic failure and that there were no acute surgical issues.
He was placed on IV vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl and stools cultures were sent which were significant for C diff neg X 1.
An infectious or inflammatory process was most likely.
A viral process was thought to be most likely, but as stool cxs were not entirely finalized at the time of discharge, he was discharged home on a 7 day course of po ciprofloxacin.
2) Hyponatremia: Na 132 from baseline of 140s, in setting of elevated Cr 1.8 from baseline 0.8. on admission.
Hyponatremia thought to be due to hypovolemia and resolved with IVFs.
Etiology likely prerenal from dehydration vs. ATN from hypotension.
There were no signs of GI bleeding and the patient remained HD stable.
Ambien 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
