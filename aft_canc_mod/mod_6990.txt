Functional Status: Was living independantly in senior housing: elevator & no steps into building.
Out-patient Neurological evaluation (OMR [**2162-8-12**]) notes abnormal mental status screen, h/o disinhibition and frontal dysfunction, positive visuospatial signs that may suggest Alzheimer's Disease.
HEENT: OP clear, EOMI Neck: No JVD, no thyromegaly, no LAD Cor: RRR no m/r/g Pulm: CTAB, rare wheeze, laying flat, normal respirations Abd: +BS, NTND, No HSM.
G tube replaced by small gauge cathether  Extrem: no c/c/e Skin: no rashes Neuro: Left sided facial droop, mild decrease in strength in left arm, but able to do hand grip bilaterally.
No tremor appreciated.
Small superficial right parietal hemorrhage.
Age-related parenchymal atrophy.
No evidence of fracture or malalignment.
Prior right MCA infarction and occipital post-surgical changes as well as new right parietal hemorrhage are better evaluated on concurrent head CT.  Abd XR ([**2162-10-23**]): Contrast injected through the gastric tube opacifies the stomach without evidence of contrast extravasation.
CT head w/o contrast ([**2162-10-24**]):  No significant change over the four-hour interval, with no new hemorrhage seen.
CXR ([**2162-10-24**]): Findings most consistent with old granulomatous disease and scarring.
No acute change.
CT head w/o contrast ([**2162-10-25**]): No significant change over the preceding interval.
CT head w/o contrast ([**2162-10-25**]): No significant change over the preceding 18 hours.
In the ICU and on the floor, the patient continued to have serial neuro checks and head CTs per neurosurgery team, all of which were normal.
At baseline he has a left facial droop and mildly decreased strength in his left arm.
Given history of previous strokes and former recommendations not to use coumadin, the patient is being discharged on no anticoagulation, with recommendation to restart ASA on [**2162-11-3**] and to defer to PCP and neurosurgery about restarting coumadin at any point in the future.
Tube feeds were started in the ICU at 15 cc with concern for abdominal pain.
On [**2162-10-25**] he had g-tube replacement, without complication, and subsequently TF were restarted.
Deconditioning: Unsteady gait and decreased strength, in the context of period of immobility s/p fall.
He is now discharged on no anticoagulation.
Anemia: normocytic anemia with baseline low 30s, currently stable.
Insulin: pt on insulin sliding scale, though no history of diabetes.
In the ED, you had a fall, and head CT showed a small intracranial bleed.
Serial neurologic exams and head CTs were stable.
On [**2162-10-25**] your g-tube was replaced, without complication.
Seek medical attention if you have any further falls, lightheadedness, syncope, weakness, changes in vision, or difficulties with your feeding tube.
