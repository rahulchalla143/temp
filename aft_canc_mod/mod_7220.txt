Admission Date:  [**2113-5-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2113-5-28**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Morphine / Penicillin G Sodium / Cortisone  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4421**] Chief Complaint: Fevers and rigors of unknown cause.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 87 yo woman with recent diagnosis of stage III, suboptimally debulked ovarian cancer diagnosed in [**Month (only) 956**], presented with respiratory distress and fever.
She tolerated her first cycle of single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] carboplatin beautifully 12 hours prior, and then developed fever and chills at 3 AM today.
CXR was consistent with CHF (BNP [**Numeric Identifier 100467**] range).
She recieved vancomycin and levofloxacin in the ED for a possible infection, although no site of infection was identified.
In [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], her respiratory distress was attributed to a combination of fever and CHF, the latter possible precipitated by atrial fibrillation.
For atrial fibrillation, she was rate controlled with metoprolol as needed.
Upon admission she was noted to have a mild tramaminitis.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: - suboptimally debulked, stage IIIC papillary serous ovarian cancer(with involvement of the omentum and upper abdomen) s/p exploratory laparotomy performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2406**] at [**Hospital1 18**] [**3-11**] s/p Cytoreductive surgery for ovarian cancer including omentectomy, radical resection of pelvic mass including bilateralsalpingo-oophorectomy - HTN - osteoporosis - hypercholesterolemia - s/p TAH for fibroids at age 30 - s/p thyroid nodule resection - LLL lung resection for "carcinoid tumor" in [**2104**].
- carpal tunner surgery - bronchitis, hypertension, - bilateral hearing loss for which she has a hearing aid  She is allergic to penicillin which causes a rash.
Family History: FAMILY HISTORY: She has no convincing history of breast or ovarian cancer to suggest a genetic predisposition.
Physical Exam: exam: Temp: 101.3 Tcurrent: 97.9 HR: 89 BP: 104/50 RR: 16 99% on RA  GEN: NAD, AEO x3 HEENT: CNII-XII intact, EOMI, PERRLA CV: Irregular rhythym, [**3-12**] holosytolic murmur heard loudest at LUSB RESP: Right lower lobe cracles, CTA in all other lung fields ABD: soft, nt, nd, nabs EXT: no c,c,e   Pertinent Results: Imaging: CXR [**5-19**]: CHF picture with stable thyroid mass cxr [**5-20**]: 1.
Increased right lower lobe opacity which could represent pneumonia in the right clinical setting.
cxr [**5-21**]: IMPRESSION:  Improving aeration consistent with improving fluid status, although persistent features of CHF remain.
No new consolidations CT neck [**5-21**]: IMPRESSION: Enlarged thyroid gland is again seen, and is stable in appearance.
Findings consistent with congestive heart failure.
The evaluation for underlying interstitial lung disease is not possible due to superimposed CHF.
Focal patchy opacities seen in the right lower lobe may represent a focus of atypical atelectasis, or early pneumonic consolidation.
Resolution of this lesion should be documented on follow-up scans after treatment given the patient's history of ovarian cancer.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Ultrasound [**5-22**]: 1)  Normal hepatic echotexture with no focal liver lesions or biliary ductal dilatation identified.
2) Likely parapelvic cysts within left kidney.
Blood cultures and urine cultures have shown no growth to date  Echo ([**5-23**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left  ventricular hypertrophy.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
The  ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
Mild to moderate (2+) aortic  regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild  (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly  thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is  no pericardial effusion.

It was thought that her CHF was precipitated by fever and atrial fibrillation.
She was placed on aspirin, and there was decision not to anticoagulate based on an isolated incident of atrial fibrillation and the morbidity of coumadin.
Fever: The etiology of her fevers remained unclear, but there was no convincing source of an infection.
She had no evidence for pneumonia by clinical sx or by imaging.
We spoke to heme onc attending as to whether fevers could be related to carboplatin.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt this would be very unusual for this drug, but still considered it a possibility, especially in view of LFT abnormalities (below) suggestive of possible drug-induced cholestasis (again unusual for carboplatin).
Patients fever curve trended down off of antibiotics, and she was afebrile at the time of discharge.
Transaminitis and cholestasis: Patient showed evidence of a transaminitis upon admission which stabilized, although her bilirubin continued to trend upwards to the low 6 range.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound with dopplers was obtained that did not indicate any liver lesions, biliary duct dilatation, or hepatic [**Last Name (un) **] thrombus.
After excluding more likely causes, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] considered the possibility that carboplatin might explain the fevers and transaminitis/cholestasis in view of the time course, although acknowledged that this would be unusual for this medication.
Hepatology was consulted and agreed with him, and felt that this was possibly a drug induced cholestatis.
Hepatology also felt that her hepatitis serologies were not consistent with active viral hepatitis.
[**Location (un) 5481**])  Discharge Diagnosis: Drug-induced cholestasis/hepatitis CHF Ovarian cancer   Discharge Condition: Stable  Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor or come to ED if you develop nausea, vomiting, fevers/chills, chest pain, increased yellow color of the skin, or shortness of breath.
