Admission Date:  [**2192-11-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2193-1-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2130-10-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Bone marrow biopsy  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 2031**] is a 62 y/o male with MM s/p allo-BMT and DLI [**8-16**] with GVHD of skin recently admitted on [**10-14**] for [**Month/Day/Year **] and shortness of breath concerning for pneumonia or restrictive airway disease such as BOOP.
PFT's revealed a slightly restrictive pattern, but pulmonary felt that the clinical evidence was not too suggestive for BOOP.
Today, he notes feeling increased SOB and DOE to the point that he can no longer shave without feeling SOB.
He does complain  of bilateral shoulder discomfort R>L, an increasing level of fatigue, and also severe mouth pain from oral ulcers  Past Medical History: 1.
Multiple myeloma - s/p MUD nonmyeloablative allogeneic transplant [**7-16**] with Campath conditioning.
His [**2191**] transplant was complicated by mucositis with HSV infection, c. diff and enterococcus bacteremia.
He has had recurrent diarrhea with rectal biopsies showing no evidence of GVHD, and c. diff was negative.
Known lesions of Rt clavicle, L humerus, recent fracture of L 4th metacarpal.
Has had pamidronate treatments monthly.
HTN for 15 years 6.
Atrial flutter, s/p ablation '[**88**] 8.
Physical Exam: VS: 96.6   127/59   72    20    98%RA GEN: NAD, AAOx3, speaking full sentences, slightly short of breath while talking, no excessory muscle use HEENT: MMM, multiple apthous ulcers on sides of mouth COR: RRR, no M/R/G PULM: ins and exp crackles heard throughout ABD: soft, NT/ND, +BS SKIN: diffuse erythematous rash with whitish scales even on face  [**3-15**] GVHD.
Evolving radiation fibrosis right apex, status post radiation  therapy to a pathological fracture of the medial right clavicle.
Bronchial wall thickening, mild bronchial dilation and small airways disease within the dependent portions of the lower lobes.
Infectious small airways disease or chronic aspiration should be considered.
Diffuse skeletal involvement by multiple myeloma.
Destruction  of posterior aspect of the vertebral body at approximately T11, for which it is difficult to evaluate for spinal canal involvement on routine CT. Spine MR could be obtained for more complete assessment if warranted clinically.
Diffuse coronary artery calcifications.
Brielfy, lung volumes appear unchanged, DLCO decreased slightly,  FEV1/FVC also decreased suggestive of restrictive disease.
Worsening diffuse bronchial wall thickening, new nodules with ground glass "halos," and new ground glass wedge opacities in the upper lobe are concerning for a progressive infectious process.
If the patient is immunocompetent, mucormycosis is most likely.
Atypical pneumonias such as mycoplasma or viral infection are less likely.
Evolving right apical post-radiation changes.
Widespread bone lesions did not change appreciably, the evaluation of the D11 vertebral body lesion is difficult on the chest CT.
Diffuse coronary artery calcifications.
[**12-5**] right shoulder xray: IMPRESSION Displaced fracture of the mid clavicle, more apparent than prior study.
New extensive ground-glass opacities and focal areas of consolidation, predominantly in the upper and mid lungs.
Associated extensive traction bronchiectasis.
These findings raise the possibility of an evolving acute interstitial pneumonia with areas of organizing fibrosis.
The differential also includes a hypersensitivity reaction to drugs (or other antigen) or possibly eosinophilic pneumonia.
Coexisting infection is likely, although bronchiolitis seen on the previous exam has improved.
New, bilateral pleural effusions.
Mild smooth septal thickening consistent with hydrostatic edema.
Lytic lesions within the right side of the T12 vertebral body and left eighth rib.
Pathologic fracture of the right clavicle.
[**12-25**] cxr: IMPRESSION: No improvement in bilateral diffuse opacities likely representing bilateral pneumonias .
[**12-31**] cxr: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-14**] through 18:  Substantial progression of consolidation has continued relative to [**12-26**] and 18 with greater involvement of the lower lungs.
There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
A 3.5 cm wide round opacity projecting over the right hilus could be a fissural pleural fluid collection or a growing lung abscess.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 2031**] is a 62 year-old male with multiple myeloma status post allo-BMT and donor lymphocyte infusion [**8-16**] with GVHD of skin, who was admitted for dyspnea.
He noted he was feeling increasingly SOB with exertion.
He had a chest CT that showed "worsening diffuse bronchial wall thickening, new nodules with ground glass "halos," and new ground glass wedge opacities in the upper lobe" which were concerning for a progressive infectious process, such as aspergillus.
Sputum culture showed growth of pseudomonas (resistant to cipro and intermediate to cefepime).
During the patient's course he had an episode of desaturation to the low 80s on 2L NC O2.
His oxygen was increased to 5L NC, but he continued to be tachypneic and oxygenation ranged from 88%-98% on 5L.
CXR appeared consistent with worsening opacities/volume overload.
He was treated with 40 IV lasix and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypoxic respiratory distress secondary to aspergillus and pseudomonal pneumonia.
His antibiotics were adjusted ultimately to caspofungin and voriconazole for aspergillus, meropenam for pseudomonas, and atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
There was some suggestion of occasional fluid overload and he noted that his SOB felt better after diuresis.
The patient never required intubation and his respiratory status improved with antibiotics and diuresis.
Once stable, he was transferred out of the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], on [**4-15**] L O2 via nasal cannula, meropenem for pseudomonas and voraconazole and caspofungin for aspergillus.
He remained on nebs and advair for symptom improvement.
Was diuresed for a fluid goal of -500 cc/day He continued treatment with caspofungin and voriconazole for aspergillus, meropenem for coverage of pseudomonas and atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
The patient's BOOP, GVHD, aspergillus pneumonia and later presumed PCP pneumonia were all insults leading to his poor pulmonary status.
Aspiration precautions: During his course, the patient had one episode of aspiration while lying completely flat to eat.
Speech and swallow passed him for regular foods, and he had no further episodes of aspiration.
Skin GVHD grade 4: The patient has a diffuse rash from skin GVHD and receiving prednisone for this.
As an outpatient he had recently had increased prednisone to 60 QD and this was decreased to 40 mg daily on [**11-29**].
Given the increased risk for infection, prednisone was again decreased to 15 QD.
Oral Ulcers: The patient has a history of chronic resistant HSV mucositis.
He was started on oral cedofovir and continued pain control with magic mouthwash.
His lesions improved and his pain remained controlled.
During his last admission, MRI revealed enhancing lesion on thoracic vertebrae.
BM biopsy revealed no recurrenece of disease.
With the aspergillus he was at risk for pulmonary bleeding, so his platelets were kept > 30.
His bony lesions were treated with fentanyl patch and oxycodone for breakthrough pain.
Was seen and evaluated by orthopedics with no indication for acute surgery.
He had a RUE ultrasound that was negative for DVT.
Pain control with percocet, but on [**12-5**] evening complained of worsening pain.
Further imaging subsequently revealed a lytic lesion in his right radius.
His pain was controlled with fentanyl patch and oxycodone for breakthrough pain.
Atriatl flutter:  The patient was admittien on amiodarone, given his history of atrial fibrillatin.
During his course he had intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation, but would spontaneously convert back to sinus rhythm.
He never required intervention and as his was post-ablation, given his poor pulmonary status and risk for increased pulmonary fibrosis his amiodorone was stopped per infectious disease and pulmonary recommendations.
The patient was followed closely and had no further issues.
His bumax was stopped in the ICU for borderline low blood pressure.
Hematuria: The patient had intermittent hematuria during his course that was attributed to his low platelets and trauma from the follow.
