There is a new right lower lobe patchy opacity that could represent early pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: Possible right lower lobe pneumonia.
On one projection, slight increased density was noted.The bilateral central venous lines remain in place and there is no pneumothorax.
-Marked improvement versus prior with only minimal residual RLL vague density appreciated.
The bowel gas pattern is unremarkable and there is no evidence of free air or obstruction.
There is no evidence of organomegaly.
Rounded calcifications within the pelvis likely represent phleboliths.
-No evidence of obstruction.
CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2157-11-6**] 2:24 PM CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST CHEST: There is no morphologically significant mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.
In the lung window, note is made of atelectatic opacities in the lung bases, however, no other consolidation is noted.
The evaluation of the lung parenchyma is somewhat limited due to a motion artifact.
ABDOMEN: Again note is made of 1.7 cm low-density lesion in the right lobe of the liver, unchanged since prior study, most likely representing liver cyst.
Note is made of small amount of gallbladder edema with normal enhancement of the mucosa, with a nondistended gallbladder.
Spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and the visualized portion of the large and small intestines are within normal limits.
No significant lymphadenopathy.
Again note is made of a low-density lesion in the right kidney, unchanged since prior study.
PELVIS: The visualized portion of large and small intestines are within normal limits.
There is no ascites or lymphadenopathy.
There is no suspicious lytic or blastic lesion in skeletal structures.
NO evidence of pneumonica or abdominal abscess.
Mild edema surrounding nondistended gallbladder.
Liver cyst and renal cyst.
Uncinate processes are intact, however, and there are no signs of post-surgical change.
There is minimal mucosal thickening in the ethmoid sinuses, with slight circumferential mucosal thickening in the sphenoid sinus.
There are no air-fluid levels to suggest acute sinusitis.
There is a large bony spur associated with mild leftward deviation of the nasal septum, but the middle meatus is widely patent.
Minimal sphenoid and ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening, without air-fluid levels to suggest acute sinusitis.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2157-11-18**] 3:59 PM New right middle lobe consolidation.
Given the fast appearance during the last 10 days it most likely represents bacterial pneumonia.
Other sources of infection in a neutropenic patient such as fungal infection, for example aspergillosis or mucormycosis cannot be excluded.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Gram stain is an equally sensitive means of detecting Nocardia in a       primary specimen.
Culture may be a more sensitive means of detecting Nocardia and       should be considered.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2157-11-28**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Pending):     NOCARDIA CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO NOCARDIA ISOLATED.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 y/o F admitted for Autologous Bone marrow transplant with CBV regimen for treatment of large B-cell lymphoma.
She is status post multiple chemotherapy regimens and a BM harvest in the OR after failed peripheral blood stem cell collection .
[**10-17**]- Day -1 patient complained of severe nausea with emesis.
[**10-18**], on day 0 stem cells given with gross hematuria during.
Hematuria prior considered hemorrhagic cystitis related to cytoxan.
Course complicated by severe nausea, emesis, severe mucositis, and prolonged neutropenia.
Mucositis severe with difficulty swallowing secretions, hematocrit and platelets monitored and patient made NPO with TPN and fentanyl PCA for pain.
Fever: Pt developed a fever to 100.9 on [**10-12**].
Concerning given for autologous SCT 3 days of chemo with new pneumonia, though patient asymptomatic and not dramatic picture on CXR.
With persistence of low grade temps cefepime also started [**10-15**].
Dysphagia- onset [**10-18**] in relation to severe mucositis, etiologies to consider primarily musositis, though viral bacterial, fungal infection, [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear from severe wretching all possibilities.
Patient continued to have severe nausea which dissipated one into treatment but returned three weeks into treatment once patient attempted to restart PO intake.
Emesis shortly after eating with no associated cramping.
KUB negative for obtruction and patient encouraged to start slow with PO to advance as tolerated.
ICU COURSE: Patient transferred to ICU on [**2157-11-27**] after found to have a worsening RML consolidation, occluded RML bronchus, and bilateral effusions.
Pt underwent bronchoscopy, had new O2 requirement (94% on 6L) after the procedure.
She was subsequently placed on BiPAP, progressively worsening SOB and O2 requirement, and became more SOB requiring 60% FM with 6L NC to maintain O2 sat in the 90's.
Large mucous plug noted in RML bronchus, unable to be removed.
Pt with significant lung pathology (RML consolidation, RML bronchus occlusion, and BL pleural effusions) as well as RLL involvment.
Minocycline for coverage of some Nocardia species (other options cause marrow suppression including Bactrim, Linezolid).
Meropenem was attempted; however, after desensitization, patient developed A-fib after dose.
During her ICU course, she also developed Afib with RVR.
Then, she was noted to have several episodes of V tach, which resolved prior to requiring pads.
She also became hypotensive and bradycardic, ultimately requiring dobutamine and levophed with minimal improvement in MAP.
Family agreed to an autopsy to shed light on the cause for her hypoxia/pulmonary dysfunction as well as for the subacute worsening of hemodynamic status, decreased UOP, and elevated lactate.
