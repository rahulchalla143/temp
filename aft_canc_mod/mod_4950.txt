No fracture.A small lucency is noted in the left side of C4 body, 5x4mm which is of uncertain nature- cyst/fat deposit/lesion.
Mild degenerative changes as described above.
No abnormal cord signal.
7 mm Nodular lesion in the right thyroid.
Massive dilatation of the 4th, 3rd and lateral ventricles with no evidence of obstruction.
CSF flow MR imaging may be obtained for further evaluation if clinically warranted.
Old left occipital infarct.
Thoraco/lumbar MRI [**8-20**] - T4 and T5 intradural extramedullary mass compressing the spinal cord and displacing it to the right.
This is incompletely imaged due to motion artifact and the absence of intravenous contrast.
Based on the available images, it is most suggestive of a meningioma.
The differential diagnosis includes nerve sheath tumor, metastasis and hemangioblastoma.
The spinal cord is difficult to evaluate at this level but likely demonstrates an area of hyperintensity perhaps reflecting edema or myelomalacia.
Thoracic MRI with contrast [**8-21**] - - The T4-5 intradural extramedullary mass previously identified is seen to enhance intensely after contrast administration.
Enhancing nodule within the spinal canal, better evaluated on recent MR.  2.
Slight fullness of the medial limb of the left adrenal, possibly hyperplasia or a small adenoma; suspicion for malignancy is low, but attention in follow-up imaging surveillance is recommended within six months.
Fibroid uterus; mildly prominent endometrium is likely within normal limits for a premenopausal patient.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 47 year-old right handed woman with a past medical history significant for HTN, HLD, DMII who presents with 3 weeks of worsening gait after a fall.
Here her exam is notable for left sided weakness in in both upper and lower extremities.
She has noticeable proprioceptive loss in the hands, right a little worse than left, and in the feet bilaterally.
Additionally she is somewhat inattentive and distractible, but language is intact and she is able to give a decent history.
Her CT shows significant amount of hydrocephalus with sulcal effacement.
Ophthalmology was consulted who confirmed the finding of mild papilledema.
An LP was done that showed an opening pressure of 26 (not fully relaxed), with elevated protein of 292.
No infarct or hemorrhage.
UA was negative but review of lab work showed a few bacteria on [**8-18**].
Patient's pain is well-controlled and the patient is tolerating a good oral diet.
She reported constipation and lactulose and a fleet enema were given along with her other bowel meds.
Her incision is clean, dry and inctact without evidence of infection.
