The symptoms apparently began this morning when his caregivers noted that he was "not himself".
He noted that he felt dizzy standing up in the morning to shave and had multiple presyncopal episodes throughout the day.
He does note some mild DOE starting today but denies any chest discomfort.
Later that day, his grandaughter found him at home, diaphoretic, nauseous, and with decreased responsiveness.
He was given bicarb and atropine by EMS with no effect.
-PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: [**2109-9-2**] at NEBH after + thallium stress with ischemia at low workload     RCA- 100% occluded at mid portion, high grade ostial disease     Saphenous graft to PDA- patent     LIMA to diagonal [**Last Name (un) **]- widely patent but anastomosed into disease diagonal branch with backflow to LAD     LCx- 100% occluded -CHF- echo in [**2109**]- EF 45% -Paroxysmal A.fib -PVD -Chronic renal insufficiency (Cr 1.7-1.9 in [**2113**]) -Anemia NOS (Baseline 30-31) -DM -HTN -HL -Legally blind/diabetic retinopathy -History of tachy-brady syndrome.
He has had runs of Mobitz II block, which have been felt to be asymptomatic.
There has been no evidence of prolonged block on multiple monitoring.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
1+ LE edema SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction most c/w multivessel CAD.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 83 year old male with extensive CAD, CHF, CKD, and a.fib presents with new onset bradycardia and hyperglycemia.
# Bradycardia: Unclear precipitant but his baseline EKG showed RBBB and LAFB so any further conduction system degeneration would likely result in complete heart block, likely infranodal, which is more likely given his lack of response to atropine.
No signs of acute ischemia and cardiac enzymes were cycled to confirm.
Permanent pacemaker was placed the next morning, which pt tolerated well and had no furthur arrhythmias.
# GI bleed: On [**11-23**] pt passed some guaiac positive dark stool with question of flecks of blood, in the setting of dropped hematocrit to 24.2 Pt remained hemodynamically stable and was transfused one unit of pRBCs.
He was held over the weekend for lowering of INR and prep for EGD and colonoscopy given unstable hematocrit and anticoagulation.
Monday with INR of 1.7, pt was taken for EGD which showed gastritis and duodenitis with biopsies taken, and also a colonoscopy with multiple polyps but polypectomy not done and pt recommended to have repeat scope with lower INR and better prep.
Pt's hematocrit remained stable and he did not have any more guaiac positive stools.
#Hyperglycemia: Cause was unclear as there was no signs of infection on U/A or CXR and no localizing signs.
[**Month (only) 116**] be a sign of coronary ischemia.
# Dementia and mental status changes: Pt showed signs of delirium, with visual and auditory hallucinations in the ICU.
History of dementia with ongoing workup exacerbated by blindness and ICU delirium.
Recent MRI ([**9-11**]) showed microvascular ischemia.
No evidence of infection by fever or WBC, and neuro exam was unchanged throughout.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: On presentation, Cr was elevated to 2.5 from basline 1.7-1.9, thought to be secondary to poor forward flow in setting of bradycardia.
# Hyponatremia: Pt with sodium 131 on admission likely due to hyperglycemia, and resolved with control of BS.
# HTN: Initially home PO regimen was held due to hypotension/bradycardia and restarted.
# CAD: On presentation troponins were slightly elevated, thought to be secondary to renal failure.
Pt was medically managed with ASA, statin, ACEi, beta blocker once appropriate with blood pressure and renal function.
# CHF: Restarted on home doses of ACEi, lasix and BB once tolerated by blood pressure and renal function.
# PVD: Stable.
Pt continued on Cilostazol  # Hyperlipidemia: Continued on statin  # Atrial fibrillation: Initially did not require rate control due to presumed AV disease and heart block.
# Iron Def.
