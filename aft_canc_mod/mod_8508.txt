She was at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**7-26**] to [**7-28**] for fever workup (no DC summary yet in OMR).
She was found to have an elevated Tbili but an abdominal U/S was unrevealing and Tbili was trending down again.
It was felt that her fever was from a UTI and she was discharged on Cipro to be taken for three more days after discharge after having been on Cefepime during this admission.

Brief Hospital Course: 54yF with stage III ovarian carcinoma s/p multiple chemotherapy regimens, presented with UGI bleed, found to have gastric ulceration and severe esophagitis.
NG tube was placed, pt made NPO, and she underwent upper endoscopy which revealed ulcerations from 25cm to GE junction at 35cm with bleeding of one ulcer at GE junction with no visible vessel in the esophagus compatible with severe esophagitis--either reflux vs. chemotherapy vs. [**Female First Name (un) **] and opening in the wall about 3mm in diameter in the proximal antrum opposite the ulceration was visualized as well as likely external stomach compression.
While there was concern that this opening represented a gastric peritoneal fistula, after discussion with the patient and explaining risks of restarting po diet, her diet was advanced and she tolerated this, though continued to have already preexisting poor appetite.
She had no further bleeding episodes, and she was treated with pain control, antiemetics, and was discharged home.
