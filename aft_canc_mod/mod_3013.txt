HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 48-year-old female with a pre-B cell ALL diagnosed in [**June 2125**] following a workup of diffuse myalgias and low-grade fevers.
Her course has been complicated by a perirectal abscess, multiple line infections, a deep venous thrombosis in her right upper extremity and internal jugular vein as well as an episode of cholestasis and hepatitis secondary to the use of Augmentin.
She presents for MUD allo-BMT.
History of zoster infection greater than 20 years ago.
History of Port-A-Cath infection date unknown.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
History of anal fissure.
Right upper extremity DVT.
Anxiety disorder.
Platelet transfusions have caused a rash in the past.
No alcohol or IV drug use.
General:  Flat affect in no apparent distress.
Neck:  No lymphadenopathy.
Lungs: Coarse breath sounds, no crackles or wheezes.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, clicks, or gallops.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.
Bone marrow biopsy demonstrates persistent acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
She underwent cytoxan as well as total body irradiation with a conventional allogenic bone marrow transplant.
She was found to have peripheral blasts and an 11q23 cytogenic abnormality.
However, a bone marrow on [**2126-2-9**] demonstrated residual blasts with an elevated LDH.
She appeared to be developing a slight rash on her shoulders, which could be suggestive of early acute GVH, although she had no signs of engraftment at the time of dictation making this unlikely.
She did have marked mucositis.
See pain below.
Hematology:  Patient did have several episodes of questionable transfusion reaction.
All investigations of transfusion reactions were fruitless.
DIC laboratories were sent off given her persistent platelet requirement and were negative for evidence of DIC by haptoglobin, LDH, INR, and fibrinogen.
On two occasions, she did develop rigors and a rash with infusion of platelets.
Infectious disease:  She did develop febrile neutropenia, and was started on Vancomycin as well as cefepime.
The Vancomycin was rotated between ports, and she was afebrile for 48 hours at the time of dictation.
Blood cultures from [**2126-2-21**] did grow out coag-negative Staph pansensitive to Vancomycin in [**4-7**] bottles.
Pain control:  Given the patient's diffuse bone and muscle pain as well as her later development of mucositis pain, she was started on a PCA on [**2126-2-25**] with good effect.
Dermatology:  The patient developed a series of rashes throughout her hospital course felt to be most likely secondary to atopic dermatitis secondary to tape or to platelet transfusion reactions.
