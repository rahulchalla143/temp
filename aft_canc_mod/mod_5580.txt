Evolving left cerebellar hemispheric and vermian infarction, with no definite new infarct.
EEG [**2190-1-28**]: IMPRESSION: This EEG shows a fairly repetitive alternating pattern between what looks like a mild diffuse encephalopathy to more significant slowing perhaps related to the intermittent use of medication although it may also represent a combination of increased intracranial pressure and/or projected abnormalities.
No clear focal epileptiform or sustained epileptiform discharges were identified although, on the trends analysis, there does appear to be slightly more right hemisphere abnormality than left.
Unchanged non-contrast head CT showing residual diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, diffuse cerebral edema, effacement of the basal cisterns consistent with herniation, and evolving left cerebellar hemispheric and vermian infarction.
No new large vascular territory infarction or new hemorrhage seen.
CT perfusion with suggested decreased perfusion in the medial left cerebellar hemisphere, also consistent with infarction.
Status post coiling of left vertebral artery aneurysmal dissection, with no contrast filling the visualized distal most right vertebral artery.
Other major intracranial arteries including left PICA are patent, however, due to streak artifact from the adjacent coils, left PICA cannot be further characterized.
Otherwise no definite evidence of vasospasm.

No new areas of abnormal perfusion are demonstrated.
Slight decrease in subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage.
No vascular occlusion.
Persistent small caliber in anterior/posterior circulations appears unchanged.
Bilateral consolidations predominantly involving lower lobes, with moderate debris within the right main bronchus extending into bronchus intermedius and right lower bronchus.
These findings suggest aspiration, likely with superimposed infection.
There are additional dependent patchy ground-glass opacities bilaterally in the other lobes, which may be infectious or inflammatory in nature.

The pulmonary arteries opacify normally without evidence of filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolism.
The aorta opacifies normally without evidence of dissection.
There is no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
A central venous catheter is noted within the SVC, but the tip is not identified secondary to dense contrast material.

No bony lesions suspicious for malignancy are noted.
Although the study was not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, no abnormalities are noted within the visualized upper abdomen.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Interval worsening of bibasilar consolidations and ground-glass opacities with interlobular septal thickening consistent with a crazy-paving appearance noted diffusely throughout both lungs with new small bilateral pleural effusions.
Differential diagnosis includes ARDS, pneumonia, hemorrhage, or aspiration.
[**2190-2-15**] CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2-14**], there is little change.
Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications again could be consistent with widespread pneumonia, ARDS, or pulmonary vascular congestion.
Bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis persist.
Overall slight improvement in the degree of consolidation, especially in the upper lobes, with several areas now demonstrating a more ground-glass appearance.
However, in the dependent region of the right upper lobe, there has been progression from ground-glass opacity to a more consolidative appearance which raises concern for infection, likely superimposed on a background of ARDS.
Slight increase in the right-sided pleural effusion, stable left-sided pleural effusion.
Small pericardial effusion.
Indeterminate nodule in the right adrenal region is unchanged since CT torso of [**2190-2-5**].

No pleural effusion.
An EVD was placed emergently for obstructive hydrocephalus in the ER and patient was taken immediately to CT Head and angiogram where his R vertebral artery aneurysm was coiled.
On [**1-26**]: Head CT was done which showed a a possible left cerebellar infarct.
Patient was then placed on paralytics as he was overbreathing the vent and had abnormal ABGs.
Overnight, he developed hypertension to 190s with elevated ICPs which were thought to be secondary to a clot in the EVD.
EVD flushed and TPA'd which did not help and a Nicardipine drip was initiated to bring down his pressure with no effect.
His CT head showed increased IVH and worsening SAH so the Heparin drip was turned off.
On [**1-27**]: During the early morning, patient became hypertensive and tachycardic to 140s, then dropped blood pressures to 50s-70s.
An ABG showed profound respiratory acidosis, pads were placed in preparation for cardioversion.
On [**1-28**]: Repeat CTA/P was stable and showed interval decrease in SAH and IVH.
The C-Spine MRI showed minor C5-6 disc protrusion but no significant abnormalities.
On [**1-30**]: He was stable in the mornign and early afternoon however in the evening he developed tachycardia to the 150's, and was febrile to 104.
On [**1-31**] into [**2-1**] patient developed respiratory distress and high fevers and was placed back on the arctic sun and subsequently needed to be paralyzed to control his shivering.
His Chest xray revealed a right lower and left lobe consolidation.
He was sent for a CTA to r/o vasospasm and evolving strokes.
[**2-2**] CTA revealed moderate to severe basilar artery spasm, patient was subsequently taken for a formal angiogram which showed basilar vasosparm.
His antibiotics were changed to provide double coverage for GNR to Cefepime and Cipro.
[**2-5**] CTA head was ordered to evaluate status of vasospasm.
A CT Torso was requested to rule out infectious process due to the patient's continued febrile state.
Ultimately his wbc came down and fevers improved - his arctic sun was removed.
He has a history of ulcer and this was thought to be a potential cause.
On the evening of the 19th patient developed respiratory distress, became hypoxic and was re-intubated.
He continues to be intubated with high PEEP.
On [**2-23**] an endocrine c/s was obtained for hypokalemia and question of an adrenal mass on CT.  His methadone was increased, initiated standing ativan.
Overnight [**Date range (1) 37495**], patient's sedatives were discontinued and patient became very agitated and restless.
His morning EKG showed an increase in his QTc interval and his Triglycerides were elevated.
On [**3-16**] patient was restarted on propofol and fentanyl drips for his agitation, as an adjunct Zyprexa was started witn a gradual increase daily.
A psychiatry consult was obtained on [**3-2**] to obtain input for ICU delerium and magagement.
Changes were made to patien't tube feed given multiple episodes of vomiting due to gastric distention.
on [**2097-3-10**] he tolerated TM for 24 hours and neurologically looked very bright with eyes open and for the first time to this examiner he moved his right lower leg spontanously.
He was seen by speech and swallow on [**3-16**] and passed with gorund and nectar thickened liquids.
