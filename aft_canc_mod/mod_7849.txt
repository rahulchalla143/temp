[**2192-12-20**] EGD: A single superficial non-bleeding 5 mm ulcer was found in the duodenal bulb.
The distal clot was removed with aggressive washing and suctioning, and no underlying lesion could be identified.
Poor bowel prep  [**2192-12-16**] 08:43AM HEPARIN DEPENDENT ANTIBODIES    POSITIVE - [**2192-11-23**] 09:42PM   HEPARIN DEPENDENT ANTIBODIES       Negative   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 6515**] was admitted with abdominal pain and non occlusive SMA thrombus.
Her pain resolved and she was started on sips with close monitoring.
On [**11-24**] her pain increased and she had a stat CTA which showed an unchanged appearance of SMA thrombus and no direct or indirect evidence of mesenteric ischemia.
Abdominal aortogram with mesenteric angiography.
Selective catheterization of superior mesenteric artery.
The patient had been receiving full heparin drip and was fully anticoagulated as well as having a therapeutic INR on Coumadin, as well as being on full-dose aspirin and Plavix prior to the presentation in the operating room.
However, due to the nature of the clot that was seen on the wire upon exchange to the 5-French short sheath, and then upon attempt to flush the short sheath we were not able to draw back, there was significant concern for a clot in the brachial artery.
ACS then did an exploratory laparoscopy and found no evidence of bowel ischemia.
She had respiratory distress and was re-intubated and taken to the CVICU.
She continued to make progress but on [**12-2**] reported seeing blood on her toilet paper, after a bowel movement and was found to be guiac positive.
She was prepped appropriately and had an EGD on [**12-5**] which showed erosive gastritis in the stomach body and antrum.
Then on [**12-6**] she had colonoscopy which showed a 20 mm polyp which was treated with an endoloop.
On [**12-14**], we were called to the bedside by night merit team for persistent hypotension to the 70s.
As of 2300, her BP slipped into the 70s, though she continued to mentate normally without lightheadedness, chest pain or pressure.
She has been having daily melenotic stools for the past few days.
An EGD was performed that showed friability and erythema of the esophagus, stomach and duodenum.
Given the persistence of her melena, however, she underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy and EGD on [**2192-12-20**], the results of which were notable only for a nonbleeding polyp in the sigmoid colon (previously seen on prior [**Last Name (un) **]) as well as some friability of the duodenum which was clipped and injected with epinephrine.
Her true INR wasd 3.3 and she was not having any melena or other GI symptoms.
Follow up with PCP regarding restarting your blood pressure meds   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: -Abdominal pain/ Mesenteric ischemia -Left Brachial artery emboli -GI bleed/ Erosive gastritis -Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia  Secondary: Bilateral Lower extremity ischemia with pain HTN Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
