Findings most consistent with gallbladder carcinoma with direct invasion of the liver.
There is tumor infiltration into the mesenteric fat with small tumor nodules and concern for infiltration of the duodenum as described above.
A gallstone is seen relatively [**Name2 (NI) 76638**] to the remainder of the gallbladder and is likely located in a displaced cystic duct.
Compression of the left portal vein by large liver lesion without portal vein thrombosis.
Multiple liver metastasis.
Multiple tiny 1-2 mm hypoattenuating lesions within the right kidney, too small to characterize, but likely representing cysts.
Moderate bilateral lower lobe atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions.
Small amount of free intraperitoneal air from recent surgical procedure.
[**2163-1-17**] ABD US: Again seen is abnormal gallbladder wall thickening, with multiple gallstones and soft tissue in the region of the neck, consistent with known tumor.
Normal direction of flow again seen within the portal vein, which again appears diminutive.
Right pleural effusion is also seen.
Findings again suggestive of cholangiocarcinoma with hepatic metastases, not significantly changed in appearance from prior study.
Right pleural effusion.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2163-1-17**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2163-1-20**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
Brief Hospital Course:  55F with recently diagnosed stage IV cholangiocarcinoma, DM2, and HTN, who presents with lethargy, weakness, worsening jaundice after cycle of chemotherapy was found to be hypotensive w/ new ARF and worsening hyperbilirubinemia with persistent fluid responsive hypotension.
After surgery declined any operative intervention, GI was consulted for possible palliative ERCP.
Eventually, went to ERCP on [**1-20**] and developed respiratory distress with hypoxia requiring intubation in the PACU.
She received IV albumin to support her intravascular volume given her extensive ascites.
Despite these interventions, she developed worsening renal failure and MODS with persistent hypoperfusion and elevated lactate.
Her coags were consistent with low grade DIC.
She was switched to levophed with no improvement.
After discussion with her family, HCP, and oncologist on the night of ICU admission, she was made DNR with a plan to continue aggressive treatment for approximately 24 hours.
After this timeframe had past and the patient exhibited no improvement in her severe septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction, and in consultation with her family, the transistion was made to comfort measures.
Loperamide 2 mg PO QID as needed for diahrrea.
Hydrocortisone Acetate 1 % [**Hospital1 **] as needed for Hemorhoid Pain.
