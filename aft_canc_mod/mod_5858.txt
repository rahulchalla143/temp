Female with HCV cirrhosis, ESRD on HD s/p failed renal transplant, seizure, HTN, recently dx ovarian mass, hypothyroidism s/p thyroidectomy referred to the ED from HD for hypotension.
Ms. [**Known lastname 3671**] states over the past few days she has noted intermittent episodes of lightheadedness particularly orthostasis symptoms, she denies any episodes of syncope.
She denies any consitutional symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills.
She does endorse a 5 day history of sore throat, rhinorrhea which has now improved.
She has also had a dry cough x 3 days.
She denies any SOB or DOE.
She states that she has been under a lot of stress over the passt few days, she lives at home with her sister who is 'unstable' and lead to them having to move out.
Per ED signout pt was noted to have foggy thinking but no evidence of chest pain, lightheadedness.
Given the level of hypotension which trended down to systolic of 69 a rt femoral line was placed.
Pt was given 1gm of Vancomycin, 2L NS with a BP improvement to 89-93 systolic.
CXR in the ED showed linear scarring in lung bases that was unchanged from priors.
Pt also 750mg Levofloxacin in addition to Vancomycin for empiric coverage.
Of note she has been admitted twice over the past 2 months for hypotension pre and post dialysis.
She was ruled out for adrenal insufficiency.
On [**5-12**] she was referred to the ED for abdominal pain and triggered in the ED for a BP in the 70s.
Again her hypotension was easily corrected with fluid and thought to be [**2-16**] BP regimen.

No acute process.
Extensive ST-T wave changes are non-specific although cannot exclude myocardial ischemia.
Non-specific inferior and anterior T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2129-6-22**] no diagnostic interim change.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
No clinically significant valvular regurgitation or stenosis.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-2-20**], mild mitral regurgitation is no longer present and the pulmonary artery systolic pressure has normalized.
Female with a history of HTN, HCV cirrhosis, ESRD on HD s/p failed renal transplant, seizure d.o., depression, hypothyroidism, substance abuse referred to the ED for hypotension at dialysis.
Admitted to the ICU for hypotension.
There concerns that this may be medication-related given she is taking multiple medications for pain which may cause hypotension, but the patient reports compliance with her medication regimen.
During this admission, the patient's episode occurred during HD and she was given fluid back which was initially removed but still became hypotensive to the 70's following HD.
It is believed that the fluid shifts and hypoveolemia [**2-16**] dialysis.
She endorsed decreased PO intake, orthostatic symptoms and her BP and symptoms improved with IVF.
She was placed on Levo/Vanc to cover for possible HAP vs CAP initially, but antibiotics were subsequently discontinued as she had no infectious symptoms, was afebrile, and had no leukocytosis.
Renal felt her hypotension was again related to overuse of pain medications, and the patient was informed the that strict medication compliance is essential.
# EKG Changes/CAD: Pt had acute on chronic non-specific ST changes on EKG in the ED.
She denied any chest pain or tightness and her prior cath in [**2128-12-15**] showed non obstructive CAD.
Repeat EKG was unchanged, CE's were negative, and the patient underwent a TTE which showed no wall motion abnormalities.
She was continued on ASA 81mg, Simvastatin and was closely monitored without incident.
# Hypokalemia: Unclear as to the etiology, pt had dialysis but her K bath is unlikely to have been as low as 2.9.
# ESRD on HD: Will notify renal of admission, continue on home regimen of Calcium Acetate .
No evidence of asterixis, hepatic decompensation on examination.
Pt has underlying mild coagulopathy with INR 1.4-1.5, thought [**2-16**] depressed hepatic synthetic function.
# Thrombocytopenia: Pt has chronic thrombocytopenia likely [**2-16**] cirrhosis, splenomegaly.
# Seizure Disorder: Continued on Keppra 250 mg [**Hospital1 **].
# Rt Ovarian Mass: Pt recently diagnosed with rt ovarian mass which was thought to be benign, pt on Dilaudid PRN for RLQ pain.
# Methadone: Called Habit OpCo and confirmed Methadone dose was 54mg daily, and she was given a dose at 2pm the day of discharge.
Unclear if this is for her IVDU history vs chronic pain.
5. clonazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for anxiety.
11. trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
Your electrocardiogram tracings of your heart rhythm showed changes which were concerning for insufficient blood supply to your heart when your blood pressures were low.
You underwent an echocardiogram which did not show any concerning abnormalities, and a repeat electrocardiogram showed improvement of the abnormalities in the setting of improved blood pressures.
You were seen by the kidney specialists in the ICU and you will resume dialysis according to your usual schedule when you leave the hospital.
Please discuss your medications, particularly your pain medications, with your primary care physician to determine whether they may be causing low blood pressure.
