She notes that the pain is worse in the left lower abdomen.
She describes 4 days of non-bilious emesis and decreased po intake.
Also reports mild SOB at rest this am.
Also, mild constipation, requiring stool softener.
No significant other issues.
Pt remained hemodynamically stable.
Basic labs demonstrated leukocytosis with a left shift, blood cx obtained.
Metabolic acidosis with AG of 20, lactate 1.8.
Non Cont CT demonstrated acute on chronic pancreatitis w/ pseudocyst and peripancreatic fat stranding.
Past Medical History: -Hypertension -Hyperuricemia/gout -Stage IV CKD - baseline 2.8 -Anemia ([**1-30**] CKD) -Renal osteodystrophy -Osteoarthritis -Uterine fibroids -s/p excision cyst from R breast -s/p unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy after ectopic pregnancy -s/p tonsillectomy   Social History: Takes care of [**Age over 90 **] yo mother and 50 year old daughter with down's syndrome.
Physical Exam: Physical Exam on Admission to MICU: Vitals: T:98.8 BP:118/60 P:70 R: 18 O2:92% on 4L NC General: Cachectic, Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated CV: Distant heart sounds, Regular rate/rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi Abdomen: soft, mild tenderness in LLQ, +BS, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: alert ox3  Physical Exam on Discharge: VS - 98.4, 112/50, 65, 20, 96% on 1.5L 3 BMs yesterday, 1 BM this morning GENERAL - thin woman in NAD, pleasant interactive HEENT - sclera anicteric, MMM, OP clear, EOMI NECK - supple, no JVD flat LUNGS - CTAB, decreased breath sounds, no wheezes or crackles heard HEART - RRR, no m/r/g ABDOMEN - soft, non-distended.
No rebound tenderness or guarding.
Peripancreatic fat stranding adjacent to edematous pancreas with diffusely scattered calcifications, compatible for acute on chronic pancreatitis.
17 x 14 mm cystic structure abutting pancreatic tail is consistent with a pseudocyst, but MRCP may be obtained for further evaluation when clinically appropriate.
No evidence of cholecystitis.
1.6-cm hyperdense structure in right pelvic floor, possible a Bartholin's gland cyst.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization:  73 yo F w/ CKD stage IV, HTN, anemia who presents with atypical abdominal pain and metabolic acidosis found to have radiologic findings suggestive of acute on chronic pancreatitis and admitted to MICU for monitoring, then transferred to the floor for further evaluation and management of her abdominal symptoms.
?s LLQ abdominal pain, non-bilious emesis, and poor po intake are not easily attributable to her radiologic finding of pancreatic inflammation, calcification, and pancreatic fluid-filled cyst (of note there are no gallstones).
She does not fit the [**1-31**] criteria for pancreatitis as her lipase is WNL and her pain pattern is atypical for pancreatitis.
Appreciated GI input and recommended outpt MRCP (emailed her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 4888**] to evaluate for anomalous pancreas anatomy such as pancreas divisum that may cause her radiologic findings of chronic pancreatitis.
Her abdominal symptoms resolved with 2L IVF bolus, analgesia, and NPO overnight.
Of note, her triglycerides were within normal limits and KUB ruled out any intestinal obstruction.
Her pain may have been caused by constipation as she had not had a bowel movement for 1 week prior to admission and her symptoms began to resolve after having several bowel movements (4 total during this admission).
#Metabolic Acidosis-resolving: Anion-gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to CKD stage IV.
Anion gap closing with fluid resuscitation.
Her phosphate binders were restarted and she resumed a renal diet.
#Hypoxia: Patient presented with SOB on admission requiring 2L NC.
Probable cause is underlying COPD as she is a chronic smoker.
Less likely PE or PNA as she is not tachycardic or without chest pain and CXR was negative.
A likely cause of her weight loss however is malabsorption from chronic pancreatitis and work-up for this as an outpatient with GI should be considered.
No significant change.
You were brought into the hospital on [**6-23**] for pain in your abdominal area and weakness.
In the ICU, you were given fluids, pain medications, and anti-nausea medications which improved your symptoms.
You were also put on nasal cannula to help with your breathing because your oxygen levels were slightly low when you arrived, but this improved and you nolonger required oxygen.
Since you had mentioned that you hadn't had a bowel movement for a week, you were also started on stool softeners and laxatives which resulted in several bowel movements on your last day in the intensive care unit, which relieved your symptoms significantly.
Your abdominal pain and weakness appeared to have resolved significantly.
We recommend that you eat a low-fat diet, low in sodium and potassium given your kidney disease.
Medication changes: 1) Please continue to take all of the medications that you were taking before admission 2) Please also take senna and milk of magnesia as needed for constipation   Followup Instructions: Follow-up appointments: 1) Please follow up with your primary care office.
