Cytology from thoracentesis was positive for malignant cells.
Anemia studes revealed an anemia of chronic disease.
Patient also reported several episodes of bleeding from cutanous breast metastases requiring pressure to be applied to stop the bleeding.
Patient has had increasing LE edema and DOE over past month, likely related to a combination of chronic disease with decreased oncotic pressure as well as possible IVC compression from liver metastases.
Chest wall infection at breast cancer site.
Patient had elevated WBC that improved with initiation of zosyn/ vanco and topical flagyl.
She remained afebrile during hospitalization.
Atrial fibrillation.
However, digoxin was stopped on [**9-29**] because of the difficulty with monitoring digoxin levels due to difficulty drawing blood, absence of symptoms while in atrial fibrillation, and patients' desire for hospice care.
