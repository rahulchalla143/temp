On the day of admission he complained of intense abdominal pain at which point they spoke to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2455**] (oncology), who advised them to come in to the ED.
While getting ready to come to the ED, Mr. [**Known lastname **] became unresponsive.

Cardiology was called, who had an in-depth, well-documented discussion with the family.
Past Medical History: 1) Metastatic lung cancer:  Advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer metastatic to the adrenal s/p mulitple chemo regimens ([**Doctor Last Name **]/gemcitabine x1, weekly [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol with XRT, taxotere x1) administered in [**State 4565**].
Most recently he was treated with Tarceva with slight disease progression on PET scan.
Initiated therapy with Alimpta on [**6-24**], with subsequent scan showing progressive disease.
No alcohol or IVDU.
Family History: No history of lung cancer.
COR:  Regular rhythm, normal rate, no murmurs.
There is a large right pleural effusion with associated volume loss, findings which suggest prior surgery - correlation to clinical history is recommended.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] of oncology confirmed that the patient has failed multiple chemotherapeutic regimens and is end-stage at this point with respect to his malignancy.
With the patient's already poor lung reserve, as well as superimposed cardiogenic shock and 2 pressor requirement, the prognosis was felt to be extremely guarded, and the family understood that should full resuscitative attempts be made the patient would still have a very guarded prognosis.
His blood pressure gradually trended down, and he eventually became asystolic over the course of an hour.
