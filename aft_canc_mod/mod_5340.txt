Large non-occlusive thrombus involving the right and left main pulmonary arteries extending into the segmental and subsegmental branches bilaterally.
Stable appearance of the left upper lobe mass with interval improvement in post-obstructive pnuemonia/pneumonitis.
Scattered sub-4-mm noncalcified lung nodules as described above.
Cirrhotic liver with lesion at the dome, best seen on [**2170-3-7**], CT of the abdomen study.
[**2170-5-8**] CXR: IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mildly dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
At least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[**2170-5-9**] BLE ULTRASOUND: IMPRESSION: DVT involving the superficial femoral and popliteal vein on the left.
[**2170-5-9**] CT HEAD: IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage and no mass effect.
Brief Hospital Course: 60M with HIV, HCV with cirrhosis/ascites, hx DVT, RCC and HCC presenting with chest/epigastric pain, found to have large saddle pulmonary embolus.
Submassive pulmonary embolus: The patient's CTA was consistent with a submassive PE.
BLE ultrasounds showed large clot burden.
Patient's anticoagulation to be managed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1743**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1226**] office who was contact[**Name (NI) **] and is aware of need for close monitoring, esp in setting of concurrent fluconazole therapy.
Given extent of VTE, multiple malignancies and that this is second episode of VTE, patient needs lifelong anticoagulation.
Other possibilities include radiation espophagitis vs CMV esophagitis or contigious spread of malignancy in setting of thickened appearance on CTA.
GI was consulted and they will evaluate for cause of dysphagia and agreed likely candidal esophagitis.

Hepatitis C/Cirrhosis/Ascites: Maintained on home diuretics (spirinolactone 200 adn lasix 80  with control of ascites - however, dose reduced given hyponatremia, slight, and slight increase in Creatinine and dry overall appearence.
Patient should follow up for endoscopy within one month to evaluate for varices especially given concurrent coumadin therapy (arranged follow up at [**Hospital1 **] with his GI MD, [**Last Name (un) 14429**])  5.Oncology: RCC/mets to lung/probable HCC: S/p cyberknife radiation (less likely to cause radiation esophagitis  than traditional XRT).
Diazepam 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for muscle cramping.

You will be on coumadin for the rest of your life given that this is your second episode of blood clots.
Coumadin helps prevent new clots and helps prevent the old clots from becoming bigger.
If you have any signs of bleeding including blood in your stool you must notify your doctor immediately.
You are risk of 'esophageal varices' (enlarged blood vessels in your food pipe) because of your cirrhosis which can lead to bleeding and the only way to diagnose/treat these is with endoscopy.
