She now presents with several weeks of intermittent AMS, confusion and occasional speech difficulty that had worsened on presentation.
She had a CT scan and MRI of the head that showed multiple brain mets (~14 spherical lesions).
Her acute mental status change was secondary to brain metastasis from her sarcoma.
Leukocytosis/infection: The elevated WBC count with fever was suggestive of infectious etiology, however we believe this is a paraneoplastic phenomemnon.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were sent and there was no growth.
The patient continued to have persistent leukocytosis on the day of discharge.
We suspect that the leukocytosis is related to her tumor burden.
