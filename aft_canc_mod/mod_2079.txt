HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51 year old male with hepatitis C virus cirrhosis, right lobe hepatocellular carcinoma, status post radiofrequency ablation on [**2154-5-1**] who presents preop for a liver transplant in a.m.
He reports loose stools x10 per 24 hours associated with chronic abdominal pain, no fever or chills, no nausea or vomiting, no cough, no urinary frequency, or symptoms of UTI.
Does admit to feeling hungry and has baseline shortness of breath.
Significant for hepatocellular carcinoma status post     radiofrequency ablation.
Hepatitis C virus.
ALLERGIES:  Patient is allergic Penicillin.
He was alert and oriented, no acute distress.
Abdomen soft, obese, positive bowel sounds, nonfocal abdomen, tender, negative rebound, negative hemorrhoids, positive umbilical hernia.
Rectal, guaiac negative, no hemorrhoids.
Extremities, positive venous changes and no edema.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, the patient had a chest x-ray that showed no acute process, no suspicious nodules.
On [**2154-10-1**], CT of the thorax was stable, no lesions.
He was taken to the OR on [**1-18**] for orthotopic liver transplant.
A duplex ultrasound of the liver demonstrated perihepatic ascites.
Portal veins and hepatic veins were visualized with normal direction of flow, poorly dopplered hepatic artery waveforms were noted, likely secondary to technical limitations.
This demonstrated appropriate waveforms and directionality of flow within the portal veins, hepatic veins, and hepatic arteries.
The CT demonstrated no cause for drop in hematocrit.
There was moderate hepatic artery stenosis noted.
There was narrowing of the portal vein at the area of the anastomosis as well as mild stenosis at the origin of the right renal artery.
A small amount of ascites and perihepatic fluid was noted.
There were multiple low attenuation areas in the transplanted liver likely representing simple cysts.
When the patient was in the SICU, as he awakened, he complained of pain control.
He was hypertensive while in the SICU.
For the remainder of this hospital course, his pain continued to be monitored.
He complained primarily of right upper quadrant discomfort.
Towards the end of his hospital stay, his pain was lessened and he was receiving 4 mg p.o.
He has 2 [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains; #1 was discontinued on postoperative day 5 and #2 JP drain continued to drain approximately 290 cc of serosanguineous fluid.
On postoperative day 7, he was started on IV Vancomycin for some erythema around the incision at the left lower quadrant.
This erythema resolved towards the end of the hospital course and Vancomycin was stopped.
On postoperative day 9, patient complained of right neck discomfort.
His right IJ site appeared mildly edematous.
This demonstrated no pseudoaneurysm.
There was also noted of a right IJ partially occlusive clot.
He was maintained on a sliding scale insulin regimen for moderately elevated blood sugars.
Visiting nurse services were set up for medication management, AcuCheks and wound assessment.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  End-stage liver disease secondary to hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatitis C virus.
Chronic pain, chronic back pain.
