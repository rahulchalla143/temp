History of Present Illness: 71yo male with castrate resistant metastatic prostate cancer and stage III CKD presents after being found to have acute renal failure and hyperkalemia on routine labs at OSH.
Per pt, went to oncologist yesterday with complaint of general weakness and increased SOB at rest with resultant labs.
He also admits to a productive cough for the last 8 weeks as well as new SOB.
He also reports intermittent nausea and occasional vomiting.
UA showed small leukocytes, 56 WBC, large blood and >182 RBCs.
CXR demonstrated mild pulmonary edema.
EKG with low voltages but sinus rhythm at a rate of 80, NA/NI, no peaked T-waves.
Bedside u/s revealed a small pericardial effusion with no tamponade physiology.
U/S also demonstrated bilateral massive hydronephrosis.
He was noted to have minimal foley output.
Urology was consulted and recommended CT to assess for level of ureteral obstruction and to continue foley decompression of the bladder.
Renal agreed with CT and urgent decompression of obstruction, with no indication for urgent dialysis but to give kayexelate for hyperkalemia and expect post-obstructive diuresis.
Denies fevers, chills with some shortness of breath that has also improved.
Past Medical History: - Metastatic prostate cancer, first diagnosed in [**2110**] s/p cryotherapy; increasing PSA noted, then put on hormonal therapy, recently completed 8 cycles of taxotere; has known spinal metasteses - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Stage III CKD, baseline Cr 1.5 in [**2116**]  Social History: He lives in [**Hospital1 6687**] with his wife.
- Tobacco:  less then 10 cigarettes per day - Alcohol:  less than 2 drinks per day - Illicits:  Denies  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Admission Exam: Vitals: T- 97.3, HR- 85, BP 127/70, RR- 17, SaO2- 91% on NC General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, NC in place Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Bibasilar crackles with wheezes, good respiratory effort.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding GU: bilateral nephrostomy tubes in place, draining well Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, with 1+ edema bilaterally  Pertinent Results: Admission Labs .
Moderate right pleural effusion.
Bibasilar opacities at the lung bases, likely atelectasis, cannot exclude superinfection.
Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
Worsening moderate-to-severe bilateral hydronephrosis and proximal hydroureter, with the ureters compressed and/or encased by extensive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy which may be slightly increased in size compared to prior.
Bilateral large pleural effusions, worse on the right with bibasilar atelectasis.
Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis with presacral edema.
Mild loss of height of T12 vertebral body is stable compared to [**2118-7-19**]; however, is new from [**2117-11-11**].
[**2118-9-28**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Worsening of pleural effusions and pulmonary edema that may be due in part to technical differences between this and the prior study.
Stable bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small on the left.
Stable mediastinal widening corresponding with known adenopathy.
[**2118-9-30**] ECHO: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, LVEF>55%, mildly dilated RV, ascending aorta is mildly dilated, at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

# Acute kidney injury due to obstruction: Resolved s/p bilateral nephrostomy tube placement [**2118-9-28**].
Post-obstructive diuresis slowing.
Aspirin held because of macroscopic hematuria post-nephrostomy placement.
# Hyperkalemia: Resolved s/p Kayexylate, insulin/glucose, calcium.
# Prostate CA: Started abiraterone [**2118-9-26**].
Continued prednisone, but dose increased for COPD exacerbation, plant to taper down slowly to baseline 5mg [**Hospital1 **].
# Hypoxia and right-sided pleural effusion: CXR with moderate new right pleural effusion and vascular congestion.
COPD exacerbation given prominent wheeze, cough, and smoking history.
# Hypertension: Outpatient furosemide held with post-obstructive diuresis.
# DVT PPx: Heparin SC.
# Precautions: None.

Acute kidney failure.
Hyperkalemia (high potassium level).
Obstructive uropathy (kidney damage due to obstruction).
Metastatic prostate cancer to lymph nodes and bones/spine.
Acute COPD exacerbation (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema).
Pulmonary edema and pleural effusion (fluid in lungs).
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for acute kidney failure due to obstruction from metastatic prostate cancer.
Your potassium level was also dangerously high, a result of the kidney failure.
Chest x-ray showed fluid on the lungs (pleural effusion and pulmonary edema).
In addition, you were started on an antibiotic for a bacteria that grew in your sputum (possible pneumonia) and steroids (prednisone) for acute COPD exacerbation (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema).
Aspirin has been held due to bleeding from the nephrostomy tubes.
