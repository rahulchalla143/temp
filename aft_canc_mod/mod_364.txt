Pt was recently admitted [**2165-11-21**] for abdominal pain, n/v/d, and increased fatigue and was diagnosed with HCC covering most of the left lobe of her liver.
She was also found to have splenic, portal vein, and SMV thrombosis (without evidence of ischemia) and was started on warfarin during that admission.

**FINAL REPORT [**2166-2-1**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2166-2-1**]):    NO GROWTH.
EGD [**1-30**]: Impression: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus No active bleeding,ulcers or esophagitis Blood in the fundus Mosaic appearance in the fundus and stomach body compatible with mild bleeding portal gastropathy No evidence of ulcers, varices or active bleeding Normal mucosa in the first part of the duodenum and second part of the duodenum No evidence of active bleeding, varices or ulcers Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  CXR [**2-2**]: The patient was extubated in the meantime interval.
Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable but there is interval development of interstitial pulmonary edema, associated with bilateral pleural effusions, small, but appear to be increased since the prior study.
The worsening in the right lower lung although most likely associated with edema, can potentially represent interval development of right lower lobe pneumonia.
Attention to this area on the subsequent radiographs is recommended and if clinical symptoms of pneumonia are present, it should be treated as pneumonia.
CT Heead [**2-4**]: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or infarction.
There are prominent cerebellar fovea related to cerebellar volume loss.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect.

# Upper GI bleed: Likely gastric bleeding given portal gastropathy, no varices on [**2165-11-22**] EGD.
Elevated INR could cause profuse bleeding from other sources.
She was scoped by GI who found 50cc of blood in the stomach.
# Cirrhosis--From HCV, EtOH.
No hyponatremia, no ascites.
# HCC--stable.
Sorafenib is associated with elevated INR, hemorrhage, and benefit is unclear in this case.
Portal vein thrombosis is likely associated with tumor, no role for anticoagulation going forward.
Watch for signs of withdrawal in next 24-48 hrs.
-CIWA scale, 10 mg valium PRN -thiamine, folate, MVI  # Troponin elevation--Likely demand ischemia in the setting of tachycardia.
Pt had inverted T waves in 1 and aVL between ED and floor, [**11/2165**] ECGs without T wave inversions.
Denied chest pain prior to intubation.
-cycle troponins--consider TTE if marked troponin elevation  # U/A--+ for bacteria.
Will assess for symptoms once pt is awake.
# DM2--regular insulin sliding scale while inpatient, will be discharged to resume her metformin 500mg [**Hospital1 **]  # HTN--hold home lisinopril while inpatient in setting of GI bleed, restarted just before discharge  Once stable, the patient was sent to the floor.
Although she had pleural effusions on both side and mild pulmonary edema, her UOP picked up and lasix was not given.
She also had a mild headache for several days, so a head CT was ordered.
The CT did not show any acute intracranial process, and no bleeds were seen.
6. cyclobenzaprine 10 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for muscle spasms.
9. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Doctor First Name 3504**] ridge and Rehabilitation - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Upper GI bleed   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for workup of bloody vomiting.
This was due to an upper gastro-intestinal bleed.
You spent several days in the intensive care unit for treatment of your bleed, and once you were stable you were transferred to the floor for further management.
Evidence of previous bleeding was seen on this study.
You were also given antibiotics for prophylaxis.
