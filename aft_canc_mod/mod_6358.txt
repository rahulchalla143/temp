Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**5-/2468**]) immediately if          sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this patient's isolate.
MODERATE GROWTH.
10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML C. diff toxin: negative .
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
No significant pericardial effusion.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
RADIOLOGY: CXR: The heart is moderately enlarged and the aortic contour is tortuous.
Vascular calcifications are seen along the aorta and in the right neck.
Additionally, rounded calcification along the right mediastinal contour is atypical for lymph node calcification and may also represent vascular calcification.
There is small to moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, although right lower lung infection cannot be excluded.
There may also be tiny left pleural effusion with some atelectasis.
The upper lungs are grossly clear, without evidence of pulmonary edema.
Degenerative changes are noted along the thoracic spine.
Marked cardiomegaly, without evidence of pulmonary edema.
Right pleural effusion with atelectasis, although right basilar infection cannot be excluded.
Port CXR post line - RIJ terminating in appropriate position, no PTX .
Large right and small to moderate left pleural effusion are unchanged.
Mild interstitial edema seen in the left lung is stable.
There is no pneumothorax.
CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is a moderate right and small left pleural effusion, with underlying atelectasis.
There is fluid within the distal esophagus.
There are dilated proximal small bowel loops and decompressed diatal lops are seen, however contrast progresses into the decompressed loops consistent with a partial obstruction.
There is a moderate amount of ascites within the abdomen and pelvis.
The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber, with dense vascular atherosclerotic calcifications.
There is a Foley catheter in the urinary bladder, which is decompressed.
There is diffuse soft tissue stranding consistent with anasarca.
BONE WINDOWS: There are severe compression deformities of L2, T11 and T9, with resultant narrowing of the spinal canal, most severely at T9 and T11.
Heterotopic ossification arises from the anterior aspect of the intertrochanteric region of the left femur is likely post-traumatic in etiology.
Partial small bowel obstruction with transition point in the right lower quadrant.
Left ovarian cystic mass with thickening of the omentum and ascites is concerning for ovarian carcinoma, The ovarian mass could be further evaluated with ultrasound.
Moderate right and small left pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] female with h/o CVA, dementia, RA who presented with fever and hypoxia to the ICU [**2171-5-6**].
She was started on Vanc, Zosyn and Levofloxacin for Health Care associated pneumonia vs. aspiration PNA.
She was afebrile, pulse 97-118, 94-99 on 2 L. At 1830 [**2171-5-8**] patient was found to be tachypneic (RR 40s) and ABG demonstrated CO2 55, pH 7.22 and lactate of 5.1.
Respiratory distress: Patient known HAP PNA, large effusion and diastolic CHF.
Acute episode requiring intubation most likely related to aspiration.
Patient with poor urine output, did not respond to lasix and dopamine drip support.
Continued albuterol, ipratropium nebs prn for wheezing.
From [**Date range (1) 11734**], patient was stable on ventilator, however experienced some apneic events due to oversedation and was responsive to narcan.
On [**5-23**] crepitus was noted around the trach site, thoracic surgery consulted, resolved without intervention.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was gradually weaned off the vent from [**5-22**] to [**5-31**] using MMV overnight due to apnea and PS during most of the day.
On [**5-28**], she had a possible aspiration event after GJ tube replacement, however, she was monitored for infection/fever, which did not develop.
Before discharge, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was tolerating her tracheostomy mask well with no signs of respiratory distress or infection.
However, upon discharge after repeated lengthy discussions with her family, it was determined that Ms. [**Known lastname **] was to be treated with comfort measures, so her trach was capped, and started on morphine, ativan, and continued on albuterol nebs while breathing on room air.
Abdominal Distension: Patient noted to have abdominal distension on admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Pt noted to have increasingly decreased bowel sounds over next week, however portable supine on [**5-24**] showed no obstruction.
CT scan abdomen showed properly placed GJ tube, ascites and ovarian mass.
Diagnostic paracentesis cytology consistent with adenocarcinoma.
She was started on tube feeds until she started to drain dark brown mildly heme-positive material from her gastric tube.
It was unclear if the drainage was either coffee ground emesis or feculent material from obstruction.
Allergic Reaction: On [**5-13**], day 7 of Zosyn treatment, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] developed a rash on her torso that was maculopapular and erythematous.
Froom [**Date range (1) **], the rash progressed to blister/bullae-like lesions, then began weepy before crusting and desquamating.
Zosyn and Vancomycin were stopped due to concern of allergy and it is thought that the reaction most likely from Zosyn and not Vancomycin.
At time of discharge, rash resolved with minimal desquamation.
Hypotension: Most likely combination of septic shock (related to HAP) and cardiac failure (see below).
No aggressive fluid resucitation due to overload on exam and CXR.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] ultimately tolerated Lasix gtt started on [**5-28**] later transition to Q8 boluses, to diurese excess fluid off with a goal of negative 1 liter/day.
Cardiac Failure: EF demonstrated new regional wall abnormality and worsened MR, troponin and CK negative.
Most likely suffered strain related to acute respiratory event.
Held outpatient BB and CCB due to low blood pressure and due to comfort measures at discharge it is not recommended that any of her outpatient medications be restarted.
Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Patient required no transfusions.
On [**5-24**], pt became hypotensive and tachycardic, remained afebrile.
Rheumatoid arthritis: Held azathioprine in setting of acute infection and due to comfort measures at discharge it is not recommended that any of her outpatient medications be restarted.
The ICU team then withdrew invasive measures such as ventilation through tracheostomy, and plans for any future G tube use.
Morphine Concentrate 5 mg/0.25 mL Solution Sig: 5-10 mg PO Q2H:PRN as needed for Pain or dyspnea.
Disp:*15 mL* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 3005**] Hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: pneumonia small bowel obstruction secondary to ovarian cancer acute renal failure secondary to hypovolemia now resolved .
Secondary: -asthma -dementia /Alzheimers type -gait disorder -dysphagia   Discharge Condition: comfortable, afebrile, stable vitals, extubated, NPO, nonambulatory   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress, probable pneumonia, and small bowel obstruction secondary to ovarian cancer.
You were treated with antibiotics and you were intubated due to difficulty breathing.
We also discontinued use of your feeding tube due to the small bowel obstruction.
The only medicine that we will prescribe you is liquid morphine that you should take as needed for pain or until you have achieved comfort.
