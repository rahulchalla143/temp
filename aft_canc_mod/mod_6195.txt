Since then, he was treated with low dose Flecainide with occasional break through atrial fibrillation until a few weeks ago when he developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and wide QRS complex.
He has been taking the Xarelto daily since [**5-4**] with no missed doses.
Prior to PVI he developed pericardial effusion without clear evidence of perforation.
Interventional cardiology was called and did a pericardiocentesis with 250 cc of bright red blood returned.
TTE following the procedure showed trivial effusion and the drain was without accumulation.
On arrival to the floor, patient slightly somnolent complaining of chest soreness around pericardial drain.
Currently, feels soreness around pericardial drain site.

There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No prior study available for comparison.
ECHO ([**6-29**]): Focused study s/p pericardiocentesis: There is trivial pericardial effusion of no hemodynamic significance located anteriorly to the right and left ventricle.
Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF CLINICAL SUMMARY: 65-year-old male with atrial fibrillation who presented for pulmonary vein isolation complicated by pericardial effusion.
Repeat TTE demonstrated little pericardial fluid and drain was removed.
Colchicine (10d course) was initiated for pericarditis prophylaxis.
No evidence of HD instability.
# Atrial fibrillation: s/p aborted pulmonary vein isolation procedure complicated by pericardial effusion.
Sheaths were removed without complication.
These meds were held due to relative hypotension on admission.
FOLLOW-UP Instructions to the patient, "Dr.[**Name (NI) 29750**] office will call you with an appointment.
