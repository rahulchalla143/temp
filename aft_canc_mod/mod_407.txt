HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia and underwent induction with Ara-C and idarubicin 7+3.
HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY:  The patient demonstrated an ablated marrow which was expected and anticipated after undergoing the chemotherapy.
Follow-up marrow results done to show if there was appropriate recovery of the bone marrow were still pending, though clinical picture suggested that the normal cells have returned; though, the question as to whether there are additional leukemoid cells has not yet been determined.
The patient received multiple platelet and blood transfusions as supportive treatment for his ablative process as associated with his chemotherapy.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient's primary issue was that he developed a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis infection in his blood which showed positive growth from [**4-21**] through [**4-25**]; thus, five days.
The patient was treated first with linezolid and then switched to Synercid because the enterococcus was found to be sensitive to that antibiotic, and the concern about linezolid was that it had myelosuppressive effects.
for his herpes.
He was covered empirically with other antibiotics as per protocol related to being neutropenic and then having an neutropenic fever until cultures were identified.
The patient was Clostridium difficile negative, and he did not have any vegetations founds on his heart valves by both transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiograms; making us confident that he did not have endocarditis.
The Ear/Nose/Throat Service performed a removal of that tooth particle and drainage of the sinus, and that was done on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**5-1**], with no complications and minimal blood loss.
He was also supplemented with potassium chloride for his consistent low potassium of 30 mEq of p.o.
Because he was unwilling or unable to take the potassium by mouth during the hospital stay, he was given potassium chloride as replacement fluids.
For nausea and vomiting, the patient was given Reglan and carafate which he said did not help him particularly.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  He was discharged to the home of his girlfriend while he recovered and was being followed for his acute myelogenous leukemia.
DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**5-8**], for evaluation and planning for his next round of consolidation chemotherapy.
Acute myelogenous leukemia.
