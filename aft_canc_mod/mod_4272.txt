Admission Date:  [**2103-2-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2103-2-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2046-10-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: hydromorphone  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**] Chief Complaint: Seizures and altered mental status.
History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 13013**] is a 56-year-old right-handed man with history of glioblastoma, staus post resection and VP shunt, who presented on [**2103-2-6**] with seizures.
He also had pulmonary embolism initially treated with LMWH and then with an IVC filter following bleeding in his tumor bed, and suffered a PEA arrest complicated by flail chest and prolonged intubation.
He also developed C. difficile at [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **] and continues on IV metronidazole and PO vancomycin in addition to an ESBL pneumonia for which he was treated with IV vancomycin and IV ertapenem (now on meropenem).
Of note, he had no previous generalized tonic-clonic seizures prior to this admission (although seems he had a temporal lobe seizure with secondary generalization at the time of his PEA arrest back in [**Month (only) **]) but did suffer what sounds like temporal lobe seizures before glioblastoma diagnosis, which presented as recurrent uinidentifiable but horrible smells.
Head CT showed 4 mm leftward midline shift and a right insular intraparenchymal hemorrhage (later found to be old) and due to concern for these CT findings he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**].
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he underwent repeat head CT which was unchanged and chest X-ray showed atelectasis but could not rule out pneyumonia.
Neurolgoy was consulted and recommended pursuing an infectious workup with urinalysis and his valproic acid dose was unchanged in dose but given via the IV route due to concern for aspiartion and was admitted to neuro-oncology for further care.
He had no further seizures and has passed [**Last Name (un) 8692**] Speech and Swallow evaluation on [**2103-2-6**] a.m.
[**Name (NI) **] triggered on [**2103-2-6**] when he desaturated to 80% on 4L and had worsening problems regarding [**Name2 (NI) 84003**] thick secretions improving with vigorous suctioning and chest PT and regular nebulizers.
Chest X-ray was relatively unchanged and indeed has been pretty unimpressive sice admission with certainly no florid consolidation to be seen.
He had no WCC response but is immunosuppressed by long term steroids.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for bronchoscopy wich required pre-procedure intubation and IP noted copious ++ thick secretions on BAL which were sent for atypical and atypical pathogens.
He was given propofol and suxamethonium and plan is for transfer back to OMED once stabilised and if his respiratory status is stable.
He noted still very troublesome cough with copious secretions although felt a bit better post bronchoscopy.
Otherwise patient noted lower sharp abdominal pain since admission to [**Hospital1 **] (of not previosuly had pain due to his VP shunt) and a 10-day history of severe right knee pain, neck pain since admission and 2 weeks of lower back pain.
Review of Systems: CVS - NO CP/SOB RS - Cough ++ with sputum + no hemoptysis or wheeze GIS - Nausea no vomiting, diarrhea 3x/day and some lower [**Last Name (un) 103**] pain as above [**Male First Name (un) **] - catheterised CNS - no further fits, no numbness, weakness and reduced mobility at baseline but not worse ES - No fevers but does feel cold and no rigors HS - No bleeding but bruises notable on abdomen but not new  Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: - [**12-21**] developed headaches and leg weakness and CT at [**Hospital3 9683**] showed right temporal lobe mass.
Underwent subtotal resection of the R temporal lobe mass by Papavassilious on [**2101-12-30**], path positive for GBM - received temozolamide chemo-radiation, followed by adjuvant temozolomide (4 cycles) - ventriculoperitoneal shunt placed [**2102-8-1**] - started Procarbazine, CCNU, and Vincristine (PCV) on [**2102-8-23**] - cycle 2 of PCV on [**2102-10-10**] - prolonged hospitalization from [**2102-11-14**] to [**2102-12-7**], during which time he had: --Pneumoncystis pneumonia --s/p PEA arrest and flail chest from compression -- PE s/p IVC filter, was previously on lovenox - he was discharged to NE [**Hospital1 **], and while there was diagnosed with C. difficile, ESBL PNA - plan was to treated with Avastin but this was delayed due to ICH Per wife has had 3 IC bleeds post craniectomy and as such has meant that anticoagulation was contraindicated.
Family History: His father had CABG x 3 age 40 and first MI age 42 and died at age 85 from CAD.

Some tenderness in C5-C& but diffuse and no bony pain.
He has moderate psychomotor slowing.
Motor Examination:  He does not have tremor, pronation, or drift.
His muscle strengths are [**5-17**] at all muscle groups, except for proximal lower extremity weakness at 4+/5 strength on both side.
no JVD but exam limited by pt habitus.
no murmurs/gallops/rubs appreciated.
Still has coarse lung sounds but much improved from prior exam.
diminished expiratory wheezes.
ABDOMEN:  BS+, soft, NT, rotund abdomen, no rebound/guarding apparent at this time EXTREMITIES:  +2 LE edema, feet cool  NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:  His Karnofsky Performance Score is 50.
He has mild psychomotor slowing.
Motor Examination:  He has proximal weakness at his upper and lower extremities, at 4/5.
The other muscle groups have weakness at 4/5.
Coordination examination does not reveal gross dysmetria.
Hyperdensity in the right insular region compatible with intraparenchymal hematoma is similar to the prior examination and demonstrates interval evolution of blood products from the examination of [**2103-1-25**].
No new hyperdense foci to suggest acute hemorrhage are seen.
Extensive edema throughout the right cerebral hemisphere appears unchanged causing sulcal effacement and compression of the right lateral ventricle, with enlargement of the left lateral ventricle.
Aerosolized secretions within the bilateral maxillary sinuses appear similar.
Additionally, there is an air-fluid level in the right sphenoid sinus.
Opacification of mastoid air cells on the right appears similar.
Overall stable examination with interval evolution of blood products in the right insula and temporal lobe.
No new hemorrhage.
Persistent right cerebral hemisphere edema with stable 5-mm leftward midline shift.
There is a vague opacity extending from the right hilum, which may be accentuated by technique and motion.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
There is a left-sided VP shunt.
IMPRESSION: Suggest conventional chest radiographs, when feasible, to investigate possible right juxtahilar pneumonia and azygos distension exaggerated by supine positions or lower paratracheal adenopathy.
The possibility of supervening pneumonia cannot be definitely excluded.
Within this limitation, there is no evidence for fracture or dislocation.
No sacroiliac joint or pubic symphysis diastasis is visualized.
No focal lytic or sclerotic lesion is seen.
Right acetabular spurring suggests osteoarthritis.

Within this limitation, there is no evidence for fracture or dislocation.
No sacroiliac joint or pubic symphysis diastasis is visualized.
No focal lytic or sclerotic lesion is seen.
Right acetabular spurring suggests osteoarthritis.
IMPRESSION: No acute process or radiographic evidence of AVN.
XR KNEE (2 VIEWS) RIGHT PORT	Study Date of [**2103-2-6**] 5:29 PM AP and lateral bedside images of the right knee show minimal osteophytic changes in all three compartments.
No fracture or bone destruction.
Relative widening of the lateral compartment raises the question of incidental discoid lateral malleolus.
At the junction of the greater saphenous vein there is nonocclusive thrombus within the proximal, mid and distal superficial femoral veins demonstrated by lack of compressibility.
Partial color flow is seen through these portions.
The popliteal vein is incompressible and no color or spectral Doppler tracing is appreciated indicating occlusive thrombus.
IMPRESSION: Nonocclusive thrombus within the proximal, mid and distal superficial femoral veins, which becomes occlusive at the level of the popliteal.
There is occlusive thrombus within the peroneal and posterior tibial veins of the right calf.
Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 13013**] is a 56-year-old man with history of glioblastoma, status post resection and VP shunt, PE with IVC filter and C. difficile, ESBL pneumonia who presents with 2x seizures to the ED and considerable problems with secretion control and thick secretions necessitating admission to the ICU for bronchoscopy and BAL.
He was treated for pneumonia in addition to empiric treatment for C. difficile, and is being discharged to [**Hospital1 **] Rehabiltiation.
(1) Hypoxia/ESBL PNA (from OSH):  Patient had known ESBL PNA and was on ertapenem and vanco at OSH.
He will be treated empirically for pneumonia with Vancomycin IV and Imipenem IV (his rehab does not have meropenem) for a total of 14 days (last day is [**2103-2-18**]).
(2) Seizures:  Likely due to known GBM with associated cerebral edema and intraparenchymal hemorrhage and with lower seizure threshold given IV antibiotics and current infection.
EEG was planned but because of logistical planning issues, it was not performed.
He had no witnessed seizures during this admission.
(3) Altered Mental Status:  Most likely secondary to GBM with question of steroids impacting this and intracranial bleeding post resection and initially due to post-ictal state.
(4) Glioblastoma:  Bevacizumab is currently on hold due to recurrent IC bleeding.
(5) C. Difficile Diarrhea:  Though toxin was negative, he is at high risk and has a history of C. difficile.
He was continued on treatment (currently on IV Flagyl and PO vancomycin) with plans to treat until 2 weeks after treatment of his pneumonia (last day is [**2103-3-4**]).
(6) Right Lower Extremity DVT, with History of PE:  Mild swelling on exam and has right posterior thigh pain.
He had doppler U/S whch demonstrated non-occlusive thrombus from superficial femoral which is non-occlusive and occlusive thrombus at level of right calf.
(7) Speech and Swallow Evaluation:  After patient's mental status improved, he was advanced to PO diet of thin liquids and regular consistency solids.
