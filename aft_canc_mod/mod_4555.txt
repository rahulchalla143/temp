# Urosepsis: Initially admitted to ICU, requiring pressors given hypotension in setting of sepsis.
Urinary source believed to be most likely given positive UA and bilateral CVA tenderness.
The patient was started on vancomycin and cefepime empirically given recent staph aureus UTIs and the possiblity of resistant organisms.
The patient's symptoms resolved with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and she was weaned off pressors and transferred to the floor.
