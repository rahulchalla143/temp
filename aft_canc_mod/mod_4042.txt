Admission Date:  [**2191-9-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2191-9-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2139-11-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4611**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Change of nephrostomy tube  History of Present Illness: 51 year old male with metastatic gastric cancer s/p 6 cycles of ECX, history of small PE dx'd 6 weeks ago on Lovenox, ureteral obstruction s/p perc nephrostomy tube placement, bowel obstructions necesitating home TPN, and pleural effusion drained on [**2191-8-8**] who presents with worsening shortness of breath x3 days.
Was seen in clinic 2 days prior to admission and CXR obtained for dyspnea and decreased breath sounds in right base, which showed reaccumulation right sided pleural effusion.
His oncologist spoke w IR re: drainage, however they felt there was not enough fluid to drain and was unlikely the cause of his shortness of breath.
Has also been having decreased output from nephrostomy tube, so this was replaced on [**2191-9-15**].
Per his wife, the patient has been continuing to have signficant shortness of breath and DOE at home, so his oncologist instructed him to come to the ED for possible US-guided [**Female First Name (un) 576**] and due to concern for possible recurrent PE or lymphagitic spread of cancer.
CXR showed persistent right sided effusion, labs revealed acute renal failure with Cr to 2.3 from 1.0.
Given his tachycardia and acute worsening of shortness of breath, MDs were concerned about recurrent PE.
While in the ED, also had singificant agonizing pain from bladder spasming while trying to urinate, so was given lorazepam 1mg IV and dilaudid 1mg x2.
Given levofloxacin and ceftriaxone for possible underlying pneumonia, and given 5L NS for fluid resucitation prior to transfer to the MICU.
On arrival to the MICU, patient is sleepy and a little bit confused due to meds given in the ED.
Still having [**5-8**] abdominal pain due to bladder spasm and obstruction, feels like he needs to void.
Does endorse a chronic cough over the past 6 weeks occasionally productive of yellow, sometimes "muddy" sputum.

There is slight increase in hydronephrosis of the left compared to study on [**2191-8-25**] from mild to now mild-to-moderate.
CXR [**2191-9-25**]: Large right pleural effusion is unchanged.
Left lower lobe opacities have minimally increased consistent with minimally increased atelectases and small left effusion.
Widened mediastinum due to lymphadenopathy.
Brief Hospital Course: 51 year old male with metastatic gastric cancer s/p 6 cycles of ECX, history of small PE dx'd 6 weeks ago on Lovenox, ureteral obstruction s/p perc nephrostomy tube placement, bowel obstructions necesitating home TPN, and pleural effusion drained on [**2191-8-8**] who presents with worsening shortness of breath x3 days, found to be tachycardic with new O2 requirement.
# Dyspnea, hypoxia:  Possible etiologies include PE, PNA, worsening pleural effusion, or perhaps pericarditis due to malignancy.
PE was a concerning possibility especially in light of his accelerated sinus tachycardia, acute O2 requirement, PE 6 weeks prior to presentation and active malignancy.
He was not a good candidate for tPA given active metastatic malignancy, and no active hemodynamic instability.
PNA was also a possibility, given his cough and right sided rales, but he did not have fevers or clear infiltrated on CXR (looks to be layering effusion on left).
It was felt that his pleural effusion was the primary driver, given it has been chronic and slowly reaccumulating.
Unfortunately due to the patient's renal function, it was not possible to obtain a CTA to rule out PE.
Lower extremity ultrasounds showed no DVTs in either lower extremity, which was reassuring.
Pt's dyspnea improved and he continued to be stable from a respiratory standpoint for several days, until he became septic from an unidentified source.
# Acute renal failure:  Cr elevated on admission to 2.3 from baseline around 1.0.
He does have complete obstruction of right ureter requiring nephrostomy tube, which was replaced on [**2191-9-15**] due to poor drainage and presumed obstruction.
No Cr done prior to the procedure, but would suspect that his Cr had been continuing to rise due to obstruction and may have even been higher prior to the procedure yesterday.
[**Month (only) 116**] also have some component of pre-renal azotemia.
Review of old images shows left sided hydronephrosis in [**7-/2191**], unclear if there may be some concurrent obstructive process now affecting the left kidney and causing [**Last Name (un) **].
His IVF was continued in the event that there was a component of reversible pre-renal input.
His creatinine was trended and remained stable at about 2 with good renal output until he appeared to become infected from a possible GI source vs. a line infection; his creatinine trended upward beginning on [**9-22**] and was 2.4 on [**9-26**].
# Metastatic gastric CA: s/p 7 cycles of chemo, has elected to stop at this time.
Prognosis was poor due to widely metastatic nature of cancer.
Had significant discomfort and nausea due to gastric outlet obstruction, ileus, and ureteral obstruction (causes signficant spasmodic pain).
When called out to the floor, he was not tolerating anything in his J-tube, including medications; nausea and pain controlled with IV ativan, dilaudid and SL zyprexa.
Family engaged in continued conversations w/ palliative care and heme onc regarding options for treatment and goals of care.
Pt's primary oncologist visited the pt and his family in the hospital, explaining to them that his cancer was metastatic, without many treatment options.
Three days after arriving on floor, bilious coffee ground fluid noted in J-tube, likely oozing from known gastric cancer.
Pt had been persistently tachycardic, became increasingly so w/ an episode of hypotension responding to fluids on [**2191-9-23**].
Spiked fever shortly thereafter, started on broad spectrum antibiotics, but continued to clinically decline.
Heparin Flush (10 units/ml) 5 mL IV PRN port flush flush with 10 cc normal saline followed by heparin as above daily and PRN per lumen 5.
