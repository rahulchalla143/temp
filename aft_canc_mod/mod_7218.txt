HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58 year old male with a history of Hodgkin's Disease status post XRT to the chest with resultant esophageal stricture, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, transient ischemic attacks with occluded right internal carotid artery, who presents to the [**Hospital1 69**] with frank hematemesis.
The patient had a routine esophageal dilation performed earlier on the day of admission.
No chest pain, no bright red blood per rectum, no melena, no prior history of GI bleeding.
NG lavage was deferred secondary to concerns for esophageal perforation.
The patient was sent for a chest CT scan with no extravasation of contrast or air from the esophagus was seen per Emergency Department Radiologist.
No chest pain, no abdominal pain.
Transient ischemic attack status post left carotid endarterectomy and right carotid endarterectomy in [**2123**], complicated by one seizure.
Prostate carcinoma, status post XRT in [**2134**].
Echocardiogram from [**3-/2140**], normal left ventricle, one plus aortic stenosis and one plus mitral regurgitation.
Esophageal strictures.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
Neck was supple, no bruits.
No subcutaneous emphysema.
II/VI systolic ejection murmur in left upper sternal border to apex.
Positive abdominal bruit.
Extremities with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
No ischemic ST-T segment changes.
Chest x-ray with bibasilar atelectasis, no free air.
CT scan of chest by report, no free air or extravasation of contrast from esophagus.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 58 year old male with a history of Hodgkin's Disease status post chest XRT and resultant esophageal strictures, status post esophageal dilatation, who now presents with hematemesis.
However, it could not be ruled out that the patient had coincidental hematemesis on aspirin and Plavix.
Esophageal stricture status post dilatation, no obvious clinical signs of perforation.
The patient did not have any further evidence to suggest any more imaging necessary to assess whether this patient had any further perforation.
Low grade temperatures:  The patient had evidence of Candidiasis on esophagogastroduodenoscopy earlier during the day.
It was thought that this might be the cause of the patient's low grade temperatures.
Tachycardia:  Most likely secondary to hypovolemia.
The patient's anti-hypertensive medications were held due to his borderline low blood pressure.
Hematologic:  Repeat hematocrit showed a drop from 34.9 to 25.9, however, the patient declined blood transfusions at this time.
It was felt that the patient's hematocrit drop was partly hemodilutional due to the large amount of fluid that the patient received.
Esophageal Candidiasis.
Esophageal stricture status post dilatation.
Hematemesis secondary to esophageal dilatation.
Hemodynamic instability and anemia secondary to hematemesis.
