ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Physical examination significant at the time for a distended abdomen, consistent with a mass in the suprapubic area, thought to be a bladder filled with clots.
Considering his history of atrial fibrillation for 15 years and several cardiac medications, a preoperative Cardiology consult was obtained.
On [**5-13**], the patient underwent radical cystoproctatectomy with ileal loop urinary diversion for a preoperative diagnosis of invasive bladder cancer.
Findings intraoperatively included a bladder full of blood clots and a markedly enlarged prostate.
The patient was quite hypertensive postoperatively, and required treatment with intravenous Lopressor, intravenous enalapril.
He did pull out one of his ureteral stents when he became disoriented on postoperative day one.
