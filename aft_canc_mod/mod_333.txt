Metastatic lung cancer.
Hepatorenal failure.
Multiorgan system failure with death.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transfer from an outside hospital with abdominal pain and small pockets of free air on CT scan.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known firstname **] is a very pleasant 83-year- old woman with multiple medical problems, history of breast and bladder cancer who approximately 1 year prior to this presentation had an aortic aneurysm repaired at our facility.
The patient presented to an outside institution with 2 days of right lower quadrant pain that progressed to diffuse abdominal distention and lower abdominal pain.
She presented to an outside hospital with these complaints with CT scan that showed pockets of free air in the pelvis but a difficult to interpret CT in the setting of bilateral total hip replacement.
The patient was transferred to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] because of her previous operation at this institution on [**2188-1-23**].
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for aortic aneurysms.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Heart was tachycardic but regular.
Chest with diminished breath sounds bilaterally with scattered rhonchi.
She had hepatomegaly with no splenomegaly.
There was no tenderness.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 9858**] was admitted to the surgical service with lower abdominal pain and trace of free air on CAT scan.
A repeat CAT scan showed less free air than on previous CAT scan and a chest CT was suggestive of lung cancer with suggestion of metastases with replacement of her liver.
Given her underlying malignancy and diffuse metastatic disease, nonoperative management was attempted for this abdominal process which was thought to be diverticulitis.
Repeat CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed on [**2188-1-27**], which showed worsening small bowel obstruction.
Therefore on [**2188-1-28**], the patient was taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy with drainage of phlegmon and lysis of adhesions.
Her postoperative course was remarkable for worsening hepatorenal failure secondary to her replaced liver with tumor.
Her ventilatory status initially mildly improved and then further deteriorated with worsening renal failure and mental status.
She subsequently expired on [**2188-1-31**], with no resuscitation initiated secondary to the patient's and family's wishes.
