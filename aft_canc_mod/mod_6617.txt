He found this odd but she was able to walk and he noted no shaking or facial droop and he just thought she wasn't feeling well.
Labs showed a leukocytosis to 16 with 97% pmn's.
Head CT showed decreased size in the left occipital hyperdensity and decreased edema, compared to her prior scans.
There was also a 0.4cm right cerebellar mass with no edema, where there had been prior to whole brain radiation.
Patient has been on decadron, but nevertheless elevated WBC (here 22K) was felt to be due to infection.
Past Medical History: Known metastatic breast cancer, s/p L mastectomy, s/p chemotherapy and treated 13 cyles of whole brain radiation [**2-8**] HTN Seizure disorder Rhuematoid arthritis   Social History: She was smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per week for 4 years.
Her mother died of [**Name (NI) 2481**] disease while her father passed away after a stroke.
Physical Exam: Gen Awake, NAD HEENT NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity Lungs CTA bilaterally CV RRR, nl S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abd soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted Ext No C/C/E b/l Skin no rashes or lesions noted  Pertinent Results: Labs: WBC 22.5 (94% N), hct 43  134  97  40  92 4.8  26  0.9  lactate: 3.1-> 2.7  UA negative  EKG:NSR, NA, NInt, no acute ischemic changes  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2163-3-12**] 6:42 PM Single bedside AP examination labeled "up" is compared with recent study dated [**2163-2-10**].
There has been interval removal of the nasogastric tube and left subclavian central venous catheter; the overall appearance is otherwise unchanged.
There is no pleural effusion.
Moderate decrease in the FLAIR hyperintensity and size of the enhancing lesion in the left occipital lobe.
No significant change in the size of the enhancing lesions in the pons; mild decrease in the FLAIR hyperintensity in the right cerebellar hemisphere, with no significant change in the size of the enhancement.
A small focus of increased signal on the DWI and FLAIR sequences in the left medial occipital lobe with no definite enhancement- can represent another focus of metastasis, a small infarct or T2-shine through artifact.
Unchanged left frontal small extra-axial enhancing lesion, that can represent meningioma or dural metastasis.
5.The study is limited for accurate assessment of any small new lesions, due to patient motion artifacts.
EEG Study Date of [**2163-3-13**] Largely normal portable EEG for drowsiness and sleep.
An excessive drowsiness or medication-related encephalopathy cannot be excluded.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing, and there were no epileptiform features.
A tachycardia was noted.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild to moderate ([**2-2**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism identified.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: 61yo F with known brain mets who presented after focal status [**2163-3-13**] that ceased with phenobarbital, no clear seizure activity since transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
Ativan was ordered PRN seizure activity but was not needed during inpatient stay.
EEG was performed and revealed slowing secondary to medication effect but no further eleptiform activity.
Other considerations included metastatic disease as there was no obvious source of infection at this time.
No symptoms or signs of infection during inpatient stay.
Keppra has been reported to cause thrombocytopenia but incidence has not been fully documented.
Lorazepam 2 mg/mL Syringe Sig: Two (2) mg Injection Q5MIN PRN () as needed for seizures.
Tylenol 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every six (6) hours as needed for fever or pain.
Maalox 200-200-20 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) mL PO three times a day as needed for heartburn.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 979**] - [**Location (un) 246**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Metastatic breast cancer Secondary: Hypertension, Rheumatoid arthritis   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable and afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after being transferred from an outside hospital after having a seizure.
Please seek medical advice if you notice increased confusion, seizure, fever, chills, difficulty breathing, chest pain or other symptoms which are concerning to you.
