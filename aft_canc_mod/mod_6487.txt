He initially presented to an OSH with worsening back pain and was eventually diagnosed with ?
cauda equina syndrome from metastatic lung CA.
While on the table for spinal fusion surgery, he became hypotensive, and his abdomen was noted to be rigid.
An upright CXR demonstrated free air under the diaphragm and he underwent emergent laparotomy and right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.
Of note, he was diagnosed with a lung abscess during his stay.
Thoracic surgery was consulted and felt his prognosis was too poor for any surgical intervention to have a meaningful effect on his survival.
His abdominal fluid grew out Pseudomonas and E. coli.
Multiple sputum cultures grew out MSSA, and one grew out yeast and another grew out E. coli.
He was afebrile on transfer to the rehab facility but by the night of [**2152-5-19**] he spiked to 103.3.
Per the ID note, it was unclear based on the available records to him if the pulmonary cavitary lesion was an abscess.
On arrival to the MICU, he denied shortness of breath, worsening secretions, chest pain, dysuria, or change in ostomy output.
He has a small amount of pain in his abdomen in the right lower quadrant.

Interval worsening of centrilobular ground-glass nodules throughout both lung fields, consistent with multifocal infection.
Lytic L5 vertebral lesions with pathologic compression fracture.
Increase in conspicuity of hypodense hepatic parenchymal lesions  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 4886**] is a 57yo male with history of metastatic NSCLC c/b cord compression c/b bowel perforation s/p hemicolectomy and pulmonary abscess presenting with fevers and leukocytosis.
1)Fever: Likely related to pulmonary abcess vs. possible fluid collection in the abdomen (right paracolic).
He was also started on Bactrim for his sputum cultures (stenotrophomonas).
He continued to spike fevers which was not surprising in the setting of his underlying abcess.
He should be sitting upright and if evidence of aspiration, PO food should be dicontinued.
7)Prophylaxis: Heparin SQ for DVT prophylaxis.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic Lung CA Perforated Bowel s/p partial colectomy [**4-/2152**] Right paracolic fluid collection Right lung loculated abscess L5 metastatic lesion with cord compression   Discharge Condition: Fair; comfort as goal.
Please inform staff at rehab if you are having fevers, chills, increasing pain or any other symptoms that are uncomfortable that concern you.
