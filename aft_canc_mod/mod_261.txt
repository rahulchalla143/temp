Admission Date:  [**2188-3-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2188-3-31**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2024**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: central line placement   History of Present Illness: This is an 87-year-old man with colon cancer who presents with several months of shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, and leg edema.
He was initially noted to have a right pleural effusion back on [**2188-2-25**] when his cardiologist ordered a chest CT scan.
He was seen today in the oncology clinic for evaluation of this possible malignant effusion, and he was noted to be hypoxic in the mid to high 80's on room air and he desaturated to 81% with ambulation.
He states that he has actually had slowly progressive dyspnea over the past year or more, and that he has also had leg edema for that same time period.
He has noticed a recent worsening, but more with fatigue, poor appetite, and decreased ability to ambulate the same distances he was able to do before.
he has not had any urinary symptoms, abdominal pain, fevers, or chills.
Past Medical History: 1) sick sinus syndrome and bifascicular block s/p pacemaker [**2184**] 2) paroxysmal atrial fibrillation not on coumadin, SVT [**2185**] and atrial flutter status post ablation 3) cataracts.
declined surgery 4) Echo [**2186**]: mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, RA and LA 5) BPH s/p TURMP [**2187**] 6) b/l edema with skin changes 7) hard of hearing 8) hx of guiaic positive stools/GI bleeding 9) osteoarthritis 10) osteoporosis 11) subclinical hypothyroid state as per record 12) hx of syncope 13) renal insufficiency 14) right pleural effusion  Social History: Lives alone.
Also had an unknown cancer.
Anicteric sclera.
No cervical LAD.
CV: RRR, II/VI systolic murmur at LLSB LUNGS: Decreased BS and + dullness at right base.
Some coarse BS at the left base.
ABD: Soft, mildly protuberant.
EXT: Chronic venous stasis changes in both legs with 1+ bilateral pitting edema of the legs.
No definite evidence of central venous thrombosis although the opacifications of the veins is suboptimal.
Probable "apple core" lesion in the hepatic flexure of the colon, which may be the area of suspected cancer.
New patchy opacity in the left lower lobe could represent aspiration or developing pneumonia.
Large right-sided pleural effusion with associated lower lobe atelectasis, similar in appearance to the prior study.
There is cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion and blurring and interstitial edema, as before.
The moderately large layering right pleural effusion is not much changed.
The moderately severe centrilobular emphysema and several bilateral upper lobe pulmonary nodules are better appreciated on the cross-sectional study.
Small bilateral pleural effusions have both decreased since [**3-22**], but severe right basal atelectasis has worsened.
Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are unchanged in their respective positions.
No pneumothorax.
CXR [**2188-3-27**]: IMPRESSION: Slight improvement in pleural effusions and left lower lobe atelectasis, but persistent right middle and lower lobe atelectasis.
CXT [**2188-3-31**]: IMPRESSION: Stable unchanged bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions and persistent unchanged left lower lobe atelectasis and right middle and lower lobe atelectasis.
[**2188-3-28**] VQ Scan: IMPRESSION: Stable unchanged bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions and persistent unchanged left lower lobe atelectasis and right middle and lower lobe atelectasis.
GLUCOSE-97 UREA N-26* CREAT-1.3* SODIUM-145 POTASSIUM-4.8 CHLORIDE-108 TOTAL CO2-31 ANION GAP-11 WBC-4.9 HCT-34.1* MCV-93 [**2188-3-5**] PLT 225 (NEUTS-69.6 LYMPHS-19.0 MONOS-8.6 EOS-2.3 BASOS-0.5)   Brief Hospital Course: 87 y/o male w/ multiple medical problems including untreated colon ca, BPH, severe PHTN, admitted from [**Hospital **] clinic w/ hypoxia of 81% on room air, transferred from floors w/ worsened hypoxia, hypotension, fevers, and leukocytosis consistent with urosepsis due to prolonged manipulation and trauma during Foley insertion.
Patient grew our ceftriaxone sensitive e.coli and treated for a 2 week course with ceftriaxone.
Patient s/p continuous bladder irrigation with resolution of his hematuria.
Patient was hypoxic at baseline with known transudative pleural effusions requiring tap on [**3-18**].
Hospital Course by Problem:  Hypoxia: - Patient w/ significant dyspnea for last few months, had been seen in oncology clinic to work up possible malignant pleural effuions.
[**Name2 (NI) **] had 2 pleural tap while in the hospital, the first one [**3-6**] with over 1L fluid, and the second one [**2188-3-18**] with 1.2L of fluids removed.
TTE showed severe PHTN and RV diastolic dysfunction w/ fluid overload.
No WML or EKG abn to suggest IMI.
High suspicion of PE in this cancer patient, but still does not explain etiology of effusions.
Degree of effusions seemed disproportionate to degree of RV diastolic HF.
Patient also has centrolobular emphysema on CT scan in the past.
Mild to moderate pulmonary effussions persistent on follow up CXRs.
The etiology of the initial edema is [**Last Name (un) 8787**] likely heart failure related.
He is being discharged with persistent oxygen requirement that has been weaned down from 5-6L NC to 2-3L NC, and will go home on this.
PE causing RLL persistent effussion and atelectasis.
- No CTA [**2-23**] to ARF, V/Q scan not an option [**2-23**] to effusions - no empiric anticoagulation [**2-23**] h/o GI bleed - Pleurodesis not a good option given transudative etiology - VQ scan indeterminent because of persistent stable effusion, atelectasis and underlying emphysema.
# Septic Shock: - acute sepsis from GU source in setting of prolonged urologic manipulation during foley insertion.
Patient intitially w/ fevers and leukocytosis.
- Hypotension w/ infection and concominant diursesis.
# Diarrhea: Patient with multiple, loose bowel movements.
Likely antibiotics related diarrhea given multiple abx for sepsis.
Treated with Imodium PRN, now without diarrhea.
# PAF, sick sinus syndrome:  on amiodarone at home, no RVR.
# Colon Ca:  fungating mass dx in [**2184**], patient declined treatment.
No malignant cells on cytology.
Pre renal from septic shock/ diuresis vs ATN from hypotension.
Hypoxia 2.
Urinary Retention 4.
Acute Exacerbation of Congestive Heart Failure 5.
Pneumonia 6.
COPD 7. diarrhea .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: - sick sinus syndrome   Discharge Condition: Stable, no shortness of breath, requiring 3L O2 for sats >90%.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath.
This was thought most likely due to lung disease from smoking, heart failure, atelectasis (collapsed lung), fluid in your lung, and pneumonia.
We treated you for pneumonia with antibiotics, we also removed fluid from your lungs and this has not re-accumulated, and we have treated you with diuretics (water pills) to help remove fluid from your lungs.
While you were here, you also developed a very serious blood infection related to your bladder.
If you have symptoms of worsening fevers, chills, night sweats, chest pain, abdominal pain, light-headedness, pain or burning with urination, shortness of breath, or worsened lower extremity swelling, please seek immediate medical attention.
