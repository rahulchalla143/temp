HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old female with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia who presented with chronic constipation, malaise, weight loss and anorexia for 6-7 months.
During that hospitalization a CT scan of her abdomen was obtained which showed pelvic mass, omental studding and chronic lung disease.
In addition, KUB revealed small bowel obstruction.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, sensorineural hearing loss, villous adenoma removed during colonoscopy in [**9-13**], status post bowel resection in [**2145**] for incarcerated hernia.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Abdomen was soft, distended, with ventral mass, question of fluid shift and decreased bowel sounds.
Extremities showed no edema, 2+ distal pulses, no cyanosis or clubbing.
Urinalysis showed moderate blood, 30 protein, more than 80 ketones, small bilirubin, negative nitrites and occasional bacteria.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2154-10-3**] the patient went to operating room for tumor debulking.
She underwent omentectomy, extensive tumor debulking, small bowel resection with re-anastomosis, resection of sigmoid colon, total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, debulking of the disease and colectomy with Hartmann's pouch as well as drainage of the ascites.
While in SICU she initially needed pressors for blood pressure support.
The pressors were weaned off and echocardiogram was obtained which revealed normal ejection fraction and 4+ TR with no other significant valvular disease.
She developed multiple atrial tachycardia for which she required Lopressor intermittently for rate control.
She was pancultured and her sputum grew pseudomonas aeruginosa for which she was started on Ceftazidime.
On [**2154-10-18**] the patient was found to be much less responsive and on ABG was found to be in acute respiratory acidosis with PCO2 at 86.
The immediate cause of death was hypoxia and hypercarbia.
Secondary causes of death are pneumonia, congestive heart failure, and ovarian cancer.
Hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Anemia status post four units of packed red blood cell transfusion.
Congestive heart failure.
