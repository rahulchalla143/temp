There is no pericardial effusion.
The patient is status post RFA of right liver lobe lesion.
Small amount of hyperdensity in the RFA site likely represents coagulation necrosis versus hemorrhage(2, 11).
There is no evidence of active extravasation.
Mild hyperemia surrounding the RFA site is also noted.
There is tubular dilation adjacent to RFA site likely representing mild degree of focal biliary obstruction secondary to RFA.
The liver appears nodular and shrunken consistent with cirrhosis.
A persistent arterially enhancing lesion within the inferior aspect of the right lobe of the liver (3A, 40) is unchanged.
Small amount of non-occlusive thrombus is identified within the main portal vein.
There is complete occlusion of the SMV which is also new since [**2120-3-6**] and slightly worse when compared to [**2120-4-17**] (3B, 147).
The left kidney contains a hypodense lesion which is consistent with a simple cyst measuring 1.7 x 2.5 cm.
Extensive esophageal varices are unchanged.
There is mild bowel wall thickening involving the small bowel loops in the right lower quadrant as well as the cecum and ascending colon.
Stranding within the mesentery of these small bowel loops as well as small amount of free fluid in the dependent portions of the pelvis are also identified.
There is no evidence of pneumatosis or free air.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
A fat-containing midline hernia is unchanged.
CT OF THE PELVIS: There is extensive sigmoid diverticulosis.
There is no evidence of acute diverticulitis.
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Interval worsening of right portal vein occlusive thrombus and thrombus extending within the SMV when compared to prior exams.
Small bowel loops in the right lower quadrant as well as cecum and ascending colon appear thickened with a small amount of fat stranding and fluid within the mesentery.
These findings are highly concerning for ischemia due to venous congestion, given vascular findings.
No evidence of active extravasation.
Liver hypodense lesions and arterial enhancing lesion in the right lobe of the liver.
Large right pleural effusion.
Left adrenal adenoma.
CXR [**2120-4-21**]: New mild to moderate right-sided pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis.
Cannot rule out small superimposed consolidation in the right base.
CT CHEST [**4-23**] - FINDINGS: A large right nonhemorrhagic pleural effusion is increased in size from [**2120-4-21**], and causes near complete collapse of the right lung, with only partial aeration of the right middle and upper lobes.
The effusion also exhibits severe mass effect on the trachea with near apposition of the anterior and posterior walls of the trachea, as the AP diameter of the trachea measures only 2 mm maximally.
Similarly, there is near complete collapse of the bronchus intermedius and right lower lobe bronchus.
A small left pleural effusion is associated with minimal basal atelectasis.
Septal thickening in the left lung suggests mild interstitial edema.
The heart is mildly enlarged, without pericardial effusion.
Minimal  coronary artery and aortic arch atherosclerotic calcifications are noted.
This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
A hypoattenuating lesion in the dome of the liver, with central areas of high attenuation, reflects the RF ablation site and is better characterized on the CT of the abdomen performed just 2 days ago.
Additional smaller hypodensities in the right lobe are too small to characterize.
Small perihepatic free fluid is new.
A left adrenal nodule and renal cyst are stable.
No lytic or sclerotic osseous lesion is identified.
Large non-hemorrhagic right pleural effusion, causing critical mass effect on the trachea, which is nearly completely collapsed.
Mild interstitial edema in the left lung, with a small left pleural effusion.
Mild cardiomegaly .
CXR [**2120-4-26**] - CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: Mild cardiomegaly with a tortuous aorta is stable.
The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable.
No pneumothorax is identified.
IMPRESSION: Stable small bilateral pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
GENERAL COMMENTS: The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2101-9-28**], mild left ventricular hypertrophy is now detected.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an 83 year old female with a past medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis complicated by portal htn, grade 1 varices, and prior SMV and PV thrombosis ([**2117**]) s/p recent RFA admitted with abdominal pain found to have a new right portal vein and SMV thrombus with CT changes concerning for bowel ischemia.
SMV and Portal Vein thrombosis with associated bowel wall thickening/stranding concerning for mesenteric ischemia.
The patient presented with abdominal pain and underwent a CT A&P on admission which demonstrated a new occlusive thrombus in right portal vein and SMV with small bowel and cecal wall thickening and stranding  concerning for ischemia/vasc congestion given occlusion of vessels.
Labs were notable for elevated LFTs (114, 127), alk phos 227, doubling of tbili from baseline (to 3.4), lactate 2.7, and INR 1.4.
She was seen by transplant surgery who recommended serial abdominal exams and trending lactate.
She will follow up in [**Hospital 3585**] clinic for consideration of future anticoagulation and need for follow imaging of the thrombus.
# GI Bleed - The patient was initiated on a heparin gtt as above for portal vein thrombus.
She had no further evidence of bleeding during her hospitalization.
She continues on a PPI [**Hospital1 **] for history of varices.
# Right pleural effusion - The patient underwent a thoracentesis with results consistent with hepatic hydrothorax.
She continues on diuretics lasix and spironolactone without evidence of reaccumulation.
The patient developed low blood pressure and urine output with this regimen requiring 1L NS and albumin.
Her weight should continue to be monitored daily and diuretics adjusted as needed to prevent weight gain for accumulation of ascites.
# Atrial Fibrillation with RVR - the patient developed AF with RVR on [**4-26**].
She underwent a TTE on [**4-30**] which demonstrated a normal EF and no evidence of valvular abnormalities.
The patient is being dishcarged to rehab for continued monitoring on telemetry with blood pressure monitoring and diuretic titration.

Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after presenting with abdominal pain and being found to have a blood clot in the portal vein of your liver and small bowel.
You were unable to be anticoagulated for this clot because you developed a bleed in your bowel.
You were found to have a pleural effusion caused by your liver disease.
You underwent a thoracentesis to treat this fluid accumulation.
