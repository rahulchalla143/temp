Dramatic interval improvement in multiple bilateral ground-glass opacities with minimal if any residual opacities remaining.
Moderate bilateral effusions with associated atelectasis are non-hemorrhagic.

Few T2 and FLAIR  hyperintensities in the subcortical and periventricular white matter consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease.

#.thrombocytopenia/ITP- The patient presented with petechiae, epistaxis and a platelet count at 1.
During the patient prior hospitalization, he became refractory to platelet transfusions, and an anti-platelet antibody screen was found to be positive.
The splenectomy was complicated post-op by a large incision hematoma and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation (see below).
#.DLBCL-  A bone marrow on [**2103-9-6**] demonstrated hypocellular regenerating marrow, but no diagnostic morphologic nor immunophenotypic evidence of lymphoma.
Yet, circulating atypical lymphoma cells were present on peripheral blood smears.
A peripheral smear on [**2103-10-8**] demonstrated findings consistent with involvement by previously diagnosed CD5 positive large B-cell lymphoma.
#.Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure- On [**2103-9-15**] (post op day 2), the patient was transferred to the ICU for altered mental status, fever, and hypoxemic respiratory failure.
A CXR was concerning for LLL infiltrate/pneumonia, and a BAL was performed, which grew only normal respiratory flora.
The patient was palliatively extubated on [**9-22**] and his mental status improved.
#.Fever/Bactermia- The patient was neutropenic after receiving ICE therapy on [**9-22**].
[**Name (NI) 14624**] Pt found to be persistently bacteremic with VRE despite linezolid therapy.
Bicarbonate decreased to 10 and pt became increasingly tachypneic.
Pt did not want further invasive testing and pt would not likely survive any aggressive intervention.
Pt's blood pressure dropped, breathing worsened, and pt was unresponsive to painful stimulus or verbal cues by the afternoon of [**2103-10-11**].
