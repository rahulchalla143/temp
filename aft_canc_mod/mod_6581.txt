History of Present Illness: Patient is a 71 y/o man with history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinomas (ineligible for the transplant list) who presents from clinic with increasing shortness of breath and somnolence.
Patient was recently discharged [**6-4**] after admission for hyponatremia (see below).
Per family, he was coughing clear phlegm last night, went to his scheduled appointment with Dr. [**Name (NI) **] where he was diagnosed with possible URI and prescribed clarithromycin, Zolpidem, and albuterol.
He became increasingly short of breath and somnolent and was noted to be shaking and coughing up green mucus.
CXR showed increasing congestion in the right hilum with ?RML/RLL infiltrate.
CT head showed no acute intracranial process and abdominal ultrasound showed slow flow in the portal vein.
Non-obstructive thrombosis cannot be completely excluded but there is still some patency of the vein.
He was given 500 cc IVF and admitted to the MICU for tachycardia and somnolence.
Of note, he was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 81256**]/10 for worsening hyponatremia.
His MELD was 29 but he is not a transplant candidate given that he has four known liver tumors on imaging.
Also of note during that admission, there was a hematocrit drop with oozing from a paracentesis site and blood in his urine after foley placement.
