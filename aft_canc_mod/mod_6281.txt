Over the past 2 months he has been at home, able to walk many blocks without dyspnea; he has been eating and drinking well, without nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain, shortness of [**First Name3 (LF) 1440**], headache or malaise.
Mild sore throat, but no [**First Name3 (LF) **] or other URI symptoms.
No myalgias or joint pain.
On the evening of this admission, he developed chills and his wife took his temperature and found it to be 101, rising later to 102.5.
He denied any other symptoms at this time.
He has a history of biphenotypic leukemia currently on dacogen (last administration on [**3-17**]) who continues to be transfusion dependent with blasts in periphery, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia.
He has also had multiple complications secondary to his leukemia including congestive heart failure, recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions, and infectious complications including disseminated fusarium which is currently controlled.
Chest x-ray was obtained which revealed bibasilar opacities.
His day 14 marrow showed persistent disease 4) Regimen was changed to 7+3.
Day 14 and 2 subsequent marrows all continued to show persistent involvement with leukemia.
5) Further chemotherapy was held as MR. [**Known lastname 1005**] was found to have disseminated fusarium [**Known lastname 2**] in the setting of  prolonged neutropenia and was treated with a prolonged course of  AmBisome with voricoanzole before transitioning to voriconazole  alone.
6) He has subsequently been treated with Dacogen with refractory disease; 7) He has had several admissions for pericardial effusions with tamponade physiology, treated medically; 8) He has had periodic pleural effusions requiring thoracentesis with transudative to exudative chemistries; cell blocks and flow cytometry have not been suggestive of leukemic infiltration, and work up for infectious causes including viral,  fungal and AFB have remained unrevealing.
9) admission for VRE bacteremia presumed to be of line origin though line tip cultures were unrevealing and completed a  prolonged course of linezolid.
9) admission in late [**Month (only) 956**] 2012for acute shortness of [**Month (only) 1440**], fevers and found to have an enterococcal empyema.

Multiloculated, bilateral, pleural effusion, with the largest individual collection in the right lower lung with enhancing visceral pleura which is concerning for empyema.
Second largest loculated collection on right side along the paramediastinal aspect has increased, while on the left side is overall unchanged, except in the left lung apex where it shows minimal interval decrease.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Admission: 62 yo M with a history of biphenotypic leukemia, disseminated fusarium [**Month/Day/Year 2**], recent diagnosis of enterococcal empyema, admitted to MICU green with septic shock and GNR bacteremia growing E.Coli.
# Septic Shock ??????
[**Month/Day/Year **] cultures grew E. coli on [**3-18**].
Initially was febrile and hypotensive requiring MICU admission.
# Pleural effusions - He had bilateral pleural effusions, with left greater than right as well as significant ascites.
His left effusion was tapped by IP, and pleural fluid showed no growth.
He was switched from Vanc to Linezolid for treatment of known Enterococcal empyema due to concern for VRE.
# Biphenotypic Leukemia - His leukemia is treatment refractory, after receiving hyperCVAD, decitabine, MEC and dacogen.
He remained pancytopenic requiring [**Month/Day/Year **] and platelet transfusions nearly daily.
# Atrial fibrillation ??????
History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Rate control difficult in ICU, with hypotension on beta blockade requiring pressors.
# Hepatitis B - Continued on Lamivudine .
