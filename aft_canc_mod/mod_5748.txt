Patient has known history of bladder cancer, diagnosed in [**2140**].
Pt presented after noticing bleeding starting on [**8-24**] and progressively increasing over the next several days, with associated fatigue and lethargy.
She was intially admitted to [**Hospital1 **] where abd CT showed pelvic  mass adjacent to bladder and vagina.
Patient was noted on the floor two days after admission, after having received 2u pRBC, with hypertension to the 220s/100s, with decreased oxygen saturations to mid-80s.
She was transferred to the MICU for management of flash pulmonary edema.
She was noted in this setting to have demand ischemia with increased ST dep in III, V5-6 compared to baseline with + troponin elevation.
She was scheduled for an MRI to further evaluate her pelvic mass and for RAS with labile blood pressures, but was unable to complete the study [**1-14**] anxiety re: noise.
She is now transferred to the floor for further workup of her bladder mass.
Hypertension 2.
Bladder mass existing since [**2137**].
Cytology positive for urothelial neoplasia [**2143-6-27**].
Coronary artery disease.
She also had an echocardiogram showing an ejection fraction of 55% without wall motion abnormalities and 2+ mitral regurgitation in [**2141**].
Bilateral small pulmonary nodules in a diffuse pattern seen on chest CT in [**2141**] for which an etiology has not been determined.
She also has a very mild ascending aortic aneurysm that measures 3.8 x 3.6 cm seen on the same CT and a right brachiocephalic aneurysm measuring 1.8 x 1.7 cm in [**2141**].
Depression 10.
Carpal tunnel syndrome 14.
Chronic cough secondary to GERD 15.

There is a circumferential mass seen at the posterior right side of the bladder (in the region of the expected insertion of the right ureter) through which the ureter runs.
This mass measures approximately 4.5 cm x 3.6 cm x 2.5 cm in size.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment/Plan: 84 y/o F with history of bladder cancer admitted with vaginal bleeding, transferred to the MICU in the context of hypertensive urgency with hypoxia, with resultant NSTEMI, now stabilized and transferred to the floor for further workup of the bladder mass.
Pelvic mass: Patient with h/o bladder cancer in [**2140**] now with new mass on US and MRI.
Need tissue dx and metastatic w/u.
Also, mass covered part of right ureteral insertion on trigone resulting in hydronephrosis.
HTN: Patient had episode of hypertensive urgency resulting in flash pulmonary edema.
Per outpatient cardiologist, patient non-compliant wtih meds, and refused studies for renal artery stenosis.
CAD: Ms [**Known lastname 3271**] has a history of CAD and demand ischemia (ST depression V5-6) in the setting of SBP 200's.
Repeat EKG after resolution of HTN  urgency demonstrated resolved ST depressions.
If you develop worsening bleeding in the urine, abdominal pain, fever >101.3, or any other concerning symptom, please contact your primary care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/or return to the emergency room.
