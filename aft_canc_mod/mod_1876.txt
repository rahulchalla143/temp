She was recently admitted ([**2111-9-28**] to [**2111-11-3**]) to the OB/GYN service for small bowel obstruction, for which she had exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions and small bowel resection.
Additionally she had post-operative fever which was found to be secondary to an intra-abdominal abscess.
In [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency department, she underwent NG lavage, which demonstrated coffee ground material that eventually cleared with 1.5 L NS lavage.
She was given 2 units FFP and 10mg vit K SC for an elevated INR.
She then developed recurrent coffee ground emesis and had repeat NG lavage.
GI was consulted but decided that upper endoscopy was not warranted given her elevated INR.

Markedly dilated loops of small bowel extending from the duodenum through to at least the level of the right lower quadrant up to a small bowel-small bowel anastomotic site.
Beyond this anastomotic site (apparent side-to-side anastomosis), there is a segment of nondilated, fluid-filled small bowel, with a second bowel anastomosis entering a large loop of nondescript bowel (unclear if this represents small or large bowel).
Beyond this, there is a third anastomosis with decompressed loops of sigmoid colon present beyond this site.
Persistent right-sided hydronephrosis and hydroureter.
Interval decrease in size in pelvic fluid collections.

Metastatic ovarian cancer: The patient received extensive prior treatment with multiple chemotherapy regimens and has demonstrated disease progression nonetheless.
Small bowel obstruction: Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] did not feel that surgery was not an option given her extensive intraabdominal tumor burden and her poor tolerance of her recent surgical procedure.
She will continue to use fentanyl for pain control, and concentrated morphine solution for breakthrough pain.
