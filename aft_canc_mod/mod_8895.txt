STUDIES: EGD [**2169-4-27**] - Blood in the fundus and antrum Mass in the antrum (biopsy) Polyps in the antrum Varices at the distal esophagus Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum .
Extremely echogenic liver which seriously limits evaluation for focal abnormalities (or intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation).
Gallbladder sludge, without evidence of cholecystitis   Brief Hospital Course: 59 year old man with history of etoh cirrhosis presenting with upper GI bleed also found to be markedly thrombocytopenic, likely secondary to ITP.
Acute blood loss anemia secondary to GI bleed: He was transferred to the ED directly from endoscopy.
There was questionable mass on endoscopy whose pathology returned as normal gastric mucosa.
He had a repeat endscopy on [**2169-5-15**] which showed multiple erosions but no active bleeding with pending biopsy results at time of discharge.
Thrombocytopenia/ITP: Patient with new onset thrombocytopenia and petechiae.
No evidence of TTP.
He only needed a transfusion on [**2169-5-3**] for a nose bleed and guaiac positive stool.
Given his recent GI bleed and cirrhosis, steroids or splenectomy intially were not options for this patient.
With regard to synthetic function, INR chronically elevated 1.4-1.5; platelets previously normal range, however markedly low this admission as outlined above; albumin low at 2.8.
Marked ascites on exam, has been stable on diuretics.
