Admission Date:  [**2161-3-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2161-3-19**]  Date of Birth:   [**2094-3-14**]       Sex:  M  Service: Medicine  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Pulmonary embolism found incidentally on a routine staging CT.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66 year old male who was most recently discharged from the hospital on [**2161-3-4**].
Subsequent workup including abdominal CAT, liver biopsy as well as multiple ERCPs as well as multiple interventional radiology interventions, concluded the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma at the head of the pancreas with liver metastasis as well as biliary obstruction.
Review of the CT revealed a pulmonary embolism in a proximal branch of the right pulmonary artery extending to the right lower lobe.
In the emergency department patient had a CT of the head done which showed no intra or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass shift, shift of midline structures or enhancing masses seen.
There was no obvious intracranial hemorrhage or obvious metastasis.
Patient was then started on a heparin drip for anticoagulation for the pulmonary embolism and admitted to the medicine service.
He denies diarrhea, bright red blood per rectum or melena.
Status post right inguinal hernia repair and left inguinal hernia repair.
Denies coronary artery disease, hypertension or diabetes.
Right Achilles tendon heel rupture, status post repair.
Right knee surgery for a question of cartilage problems, status post surgery.
Recently diagnosed pancreatic cancer with liver metastasis, status post biliary stent placement and intervention.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Brother died of pancreatic cancer 1.5 years ago.
Neck was supple, there was no lymphadenopathy.
Pulmonary diminished breath sounds bilaterally and poor air movement, but with good inspiratory effort.
Had bibasilar crackles.
Cardiac S1, S2, normal, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, gallops or rubs, no elevated JVD.
Abdomen normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, had a biliary drain intact, nontender.
There was trace guaiac positive biliary fluid.
There was tenderness in the right upper quadrant and left upper quadrant.
On GU exam trace guaiac positive, but patient had positive hemorrhoids.
Dorsalis pedis 2+ pulses bilaterally.
No focal weakness.
Small hiatal hernia.
A 4 mm subpleural nodular density along the lateral aspect of the left lower lobe.
There was no effusion.
There was a filling defect of the proximal branch of the right pulmonary artery extending to the right middle lobe and right lower lobe.
The appearance of this was consistent with pulmonary emboli.
The impression of the CT was that intraluminal filling defects within the pulmonary artery branches to both the right middle lobe and right lower lobe were consistent with pulmonary emboli.
CT of the abdomen multiple low attenuation lesions of the liver, low attenuation of the head of the pancreas.
CT of the head no intracranial or extracranial hemorrhage, no metastasis.
EKG sinus rhythm, rate 90 beats per minute, normal axis, no ST-T wave changes.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 66 year old white male with a history of recently diagnosed pancreatic cancer who was called back to [**Hospital1 18**] for pulmonary embolism which was found incidentally on a routine staging CT.  As there is no contraindication for anticoagulation (negative head CT, guaiac negative stools), patient was started on a heparin drip for anticoagulation.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2161-3-6**] patient had a head CT, no metastasis to the head, no intracranial or extracranial hemorrhage.
Due to his high bilirubin and the potential interactions of Coumadin with capecitabine, the oncology consult recommended dosing of enoxaparin (Lovenox) instead of Coumadin as anticoagulation.
This evaluation revealed a patent common bile duct, however, a new diagnosis of stenosis proximal to the common bile duct stent was seen.
On [**2161-3-7**] biliary drainage turned bloody with some clots in the drainage bag.
There was a question of whether this was secondary to tumor bleeding, possible liver bleeding with anticoagulation or possible tube track-communication to the portal branch of one of the vessels.
Approximately 20 cc of bloody clot was found in the bag, but patient was hemodynamically stable.
On [**2161-3-8**] the patient began to have abdominal pain, particularly lower back pain.
Patient began to complain of nausea and positive vomiting.
Abdomen was soft, nontender with no rebound initially.
It appeared that there was no output from the stent and that the biliary drainage catheter was obstructed.
The results of the CT abdomen showed again liver with numerous hypodense lesions consistent with metastasis, but there were no signs of intrahepatic ductal dilatation, no evidence of hemorrhage of the liver lesions and no evidence of bleeding into the abdomen/retroperitoneal area.
Since patient was afebrile, hemodynamically stable and there began to be minimal output from his biliary drain, it was decided that patient would be closely watched overnight and if there were any problems, patient would be started on empiric antibiotic therapy.
In addition, Lovenox was discontinued on [**2161-3-8**] in the a.m. after patient had episodes of bloody clots in his bag.
Over the night the patient had one to two teaspoons of coffee ground emesis and his biliary bag became completely occluded.
There was no drainage in the bag whatsoever.
In the early morning of [**2161-3-9**] (2:00 to 4:00 a.m.) the patient became febrile to 101.7, blood pressure 90/40, heart rate in the 140s, respiratory rate 26, O2 saturation 96% in room air.
There was extreme concern for infection given that his biliary stent appeared to be occluded.
EKG was done which showed sinus tachycardia, no ST-T wave changes.
At this point in time it was felt that patient likely had ascending cholangitis secondary to undrained biliary fluid which was leading to sepsis and acidemia.
Patient was hydrated very aggressively with 3 to 4 liters of normal saline and still had decreased urine output.
At this point in time there was no evidence of a blood clot.
He was hydrated aggressively with IV fluids (normal saline) as he appeared to be intravascularly depleted with low blood pressure, tachycardia and decreased urine output.
The impression at this time was that patient had blood causing a blood clot which subsequently obstructed his biliary drainage, caused biliary fluid to back up causing ascending cholangitis and subsequent sepsis.
After interventional radiology had intervened and upsized his biliary drainage tube, there were no more blood clots and the biliary catheter was patent with the bile being brown.
On the initial cholangiogram that was done there was a question of whether there was a biliary tract fistula with one of the pleural vessels.
This was discussed with the interventional radiology team and they felt that it was safe to anticoagulate patient for his pulmonary embolism.
Blood cultures at this time showed initially a question of gram positive rods.
Patient's heparin was discontinued and patient was taken to interventional radiology for a tube check (cholangiogram) to check for effective drainage.
On [**2161-3-12**] Enterococcus was identified as Enterococcus faecalis with sensitivities pending.
It was Enterococcus faecalis sensitive to ampicillin and resistant to levofloxacin as well as some synergy with streptomycin.
Adding streptomycin in addition to ampicillin as well as Flagyl was considered, however, it was decided against secondary to the severe potential toxicity related to streptomycin.
A Lovenox trial was initiated, in treatment of his pulmonary embolism.
The thought was that if patient rebled on Lovenox, patient would require an IVC filter for prevention of future pulmonary emboli.
and there was no evidence of bleeding.
In addition, his stools were guaiaced and there was no evidence of melena or bright red blood per rectum.
It appeared that patient's prior episodes of bleeding while on heparin/Lovenox were due to the fistulous tract between the branch of the right hepatic artery with the biliary tract.
Subsequent to his embolization on [**2161-3-11**], there had not been any apparent episodes of bleeding in his biliary drainage bag and it appeared that the source of the bleeding had stopped.
Patient was readmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for pulmonary embolism.
In addition, patient had anemia secondary to acute blood loss requiring transfusion of packed red blood cells.
Biliary obstruction and jaundice, status post percutaneous drain placement/common bile duct stenting.
It appeared that patient had ascending cholangitis leading to sepsis.
Blood cultures as well as biliary culture revealed Enterococcus faecalis sensitive to ampicillin, resistant to levofloxacin.
There are several causative factors to his pancreatitis with post procedure pancreatitis being a contribution as well as the fact that patient has a very large tumor/mass at the head of the pancreas.
There could also be some fluctuation as well secondary to a question of intermittent/transient obstruction in the ampulla.
Patient did not have any abdominal pain and denied abdominal tenderness.
At this point in time since he is not symptomatic from the pancreatitis, there will be no further intervention (no ERCP will be pursued).
Head CT was without metastasis or hemorrhage.
The patient had IV fluids at 125 cc an hour for rehydration purposes while patient had decreased appetite.
Of note, patient does have occasional nausea and decreased p.o.
Of note, patient does not have severe pain, but does have occasional back pain when he lays in bed too long.
The patient has pancreatic cancer (adenocarcinoma) with liver metastasis.
In addition, tumor burden causes biliary obstruction as well.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  If the patient starts having bloody stools, fever greater than 100.5, fast heart rate greater than 110, chills/sweating or dizziness with standing/walking, please go to the nearest emergency department.
No bloody stools.
It appears that the fistula between the branch of the right hepatic artery and the biliary tract was the cause of the bleeding while on anticoagulation.
The fistula has since been embolized and there appears to be no more evidence of bleeding.
External biliary drain has been pulled and patient only has an internal drain with his common bile duct stent.
Since his last manipulation/intervention was on [**2161-3-18**], he should have 10 days of IV antibiotics given his past medical history of sepsis with Enterococcus.
Pancreatic cancer with liver metastasis.
Anemia secondary to blood loss requiring transfusion of packed red blood cells.
Biliary tract fistula to branch of the right hepatic artery causing acute blood loss, embolized.
Sepsis likely secondary to ascending cholangitis.
Patient had no abdominal pain.
q.six hours as needed for agitation.
