He has had a right parietal lesion that has been monitored (question tumor vs radiation necrosis) which was discussed in the BTC yesterday.
Patient presents today to discuss surgical resection  Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: -[**2103-12-1**] resection of a 1.85mm thick melanoma from his left calf, wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy with no melanoma detected, and he had a wide local excision with 3 sentinel lymph nodes.
He subsequently developed a nodule at the scar site on his left calf with biopsy revealing melanoma.
He underwent wide local excision with pathology revealing melanoma approximately 1.2 x 2.5 cm in diameter.
-[**2108-12-31**], he was noted to have lymph nodes in the left inguinal area.
FNA positive for melanoma PET CT scan showed FDG uptake in the left inguinal area only.
PET CT Scan showed FDG uptake in the neck as well as what appeared to be a 15 mm metastasis in the left parietal lobe near the cortex.
Head MRI confirmed parietal lobe metastasis.
-[**2109-10-1**] CyberKnife treatment with followup MRI showing residual abnormality of the radiation site, but no new lesions.
-[**2109-10-31**] restarted on GM CSF Repeat PET CT scan shows uptake in the abdomen with a 1.5 cm mass in the mesentery of the small bowel near the jejunum.
-[**2110-2-14**], resection of proximal sigmoid colon with pathology showing melanoma in 1 lymph node -[**2110-3-31**] PET/CT scan showed FDG uptake in the area of the left kidney with slow growth noted on followup torso CT scan on [**2110-6-11**].
CT guided renal biopsy was performed, which showed evidence of melanoma.

Pertinent Results: MRI Head [**1-10**]  Increase in size of right parietal enhancing lesion with increased surrounding edema.
No other enhancing lesions are identified.
There are areas of activation in the right parietal cortex during left foot movement which are close to the right parietal lesion as described above.
CT Head [**4-6**] Expected postoperative appearance of resection of known right parietal mass with stable vasogenic edema and minimal mass effect on the right lateral ventricle.
No postoperative hemorrhage identified.
He tolerated the procedure very well with no complications.
A CT head showed no hemorrhage and good resection of mass.
