Initial MDS course was complicated by mucor infection of the tongue with prolonged ICU course for upper airway obsturuction, followed by pericoronitis as well as perirectal abcess.
Post transplant course c/b VRE + Coag neg staph bacteremia [**6-/2137**] (treated with dapsone); CMV viremia [**7-/2137**], c.dif infection [**10/2137**] (treated with 14 days oral vanc), admission on [**10/2137**] for low grade temperature attributed to +CMV viremia with prolonged IV ganciclovir --> oral Valgancyclovir course; last admission 10/4-6 for neutropenic fever, CT chest showed non specific minimal peribronchial ground-glass opacity in the left lower lobe, treated with course of levofloxacine; Saw ID [**12-11**] Valgancyclovir was stopped as CMV viral loads remained negative since [**10-21**], was started on valacyclovir for HSV/VZV PPx.
He also continues oral Posiconazole for mucor and monthly pentamidine nebs for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] (most recent [**12-27**]).

Thrombocytopenia has been continous throughout his illness and latley stable at ~ 25,000.
Finally he is thought to be at low risk for GVH and thus stopped immunosupressive meds in [**2137-9-16**] (was on tacrolimus prior).
Patient now presents with 3 weeks of rhinitis and dry cough, mild soar throat, pain in anterior chest when he coughs.
Since day prior to admission chills and rigors, and from day of admission weakness, malaise and fever tp 104.

LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):       GRAM STAIN OF THIS SPECIMEN INDICATES CONTAMINATION WITH       OROPHARYNGEAL SECRETIONS AND INVALIDATES RESULTS.
STUDIES EKGs [**2138-1-9**] 11:48 am- Probable sinus tachycardia at a rate of 145 per minute.
Compared with previous tracing of [**2137-11-12**] the heart rate has increased by 55 beats per minute and there is more marked left axis deviation.
[**2138-1-9**] 1:21 pm Sinus tachycardia at 125 beats per minute.
Left axis deviation, possible left anterior fascicular block.
T wave changes in the anterior and lateral precordial leads may be non-specific.
Abnormal R wave progression from leads V1-V3 may be due to incorrect lead placement.
FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low with mild widening of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.
There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
There is a left retrocardiac opacity extending into the left perihilar region concerning for an infectious process.
IMPRESSION: Left basilar opacities concerning for pneumonia.
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 13617**] DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Approved: [**Doctor First Name **] [**2138-1-9**] 7:35 PM   Brief Hospital Course: 26 yo man s/p single cord transplant ([**6-/2137**]) for hypoplastic MDS with c/b mucormycosis, CMV infection, c.dif and VRE bacteremia, with persistent pancytopenia likely [**3-20**] myelosuppression from CMV + antivirals who is now admitted to the ICU from home for septic shock.
SEPTIC SHOCK [**3-20**] LLL PNEUMONIA: On admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient was felt to most likely be in septic shock given fever and hypotension despite fluid resucitation in a immunocompromised patient.
Chest xray showed a retrocardiac opacity.
He was started on broad spectrum antimicrobials including IV daptomycine (h/o VRE) + meropenem (cefepim allergy) + azithromycin (for atypical coverage).
Patient is thrombocytopenic at baseline and was noted to have a plt count of 25 on admission.
Patient also noted to have large volume of golden brown stool.
Pneumonia was confirmed with a CT chest which showed multiple bilateral patchy opacities, with more confluent opacities at the left lower lobe, are likely representative of multifocal pneumonia.
Given the patient's history of mucor infection a CT of the sinus was performed which showed sinus thickening but no abscesses or bone erosion.
Of note patient also noted to have transaminities which was attributed to medication effect.
Patient was also noted to have a mild metabolic acidosis attributed to elevated lactate which improved with admistration of IVF.
# MUCORMYCOSIS: pt has h/o mucormycosis.
Initially concerned for mucor on presentation to ICU w septic shock.
Diarrhea resolved with supportive care.
# BK VIRUS: pt found positive for BK virus (viral load [**Numeric Identifier **], reference range <500 copies/mL).
He still has low cell counts on CBC, as is to be expected for the year following his transplant.
