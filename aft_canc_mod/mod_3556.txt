She states that this lasted hours, was not all words, and had no slurred speech, no inability to understand speech and she knew which words she wanted to say.
During this time those around her stated that she had a left sided droop and possibly slurred speech.
On ROS she denies current HA, language difficulty, vertigo, CP, SOB, fever or chills, weakness or chances to sensation.
She does however support pain in her low back and hips with walking and uses support for ambulation.
HTN 2. asthma 3. emphysema 4.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM Neck: left side post surgical scar clean and intact.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Able to name DOW backward without difficulty.
There were no paraphasic errors.
was able to name both high and low frequency objects.
There was no evidence of apraxia or neglect.
VII: right side slight facial droop.
No dysmetria on FNF bilaterally.
Small low attenuation in the left caudate head consistent with an infarct of indeterminate age, likely chronic.
Small area of low density in the left subinsular white matter, infarct of indeterminate age.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
Status post left carotid endarterectomy with soft tissue changes and without evidence of a flow-limiting stenosis in the major neck vessels.
MRI-HEAD [**6-7**] IMPRESSION: Two small foci of bright diffusion signal abnormalities in the left frontal cortex and left centrum semiovale associated with FLAIR signal changes likely to suggest recent infarcts without convincing ADC abnormality.
Old lacunar infarct in the left head of caudate nucleus.
EEG [**6-9**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG despite the normal posterior dominant rhythm during the waking state due to the presence of bursts of generalized delta frequency slowing which represents deep midline and subcortical dysfunction.
There were no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures seen .
No obvious cardiac source of embolism in a technically limited study.
Technically suboptimal to exclude focal wall motion abnormality.
Borderline pulmonary hypertension.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**6-9**] IMPRESSION: Acute watershed infarction involving the left cerebral hemisphere, new since the prior MRI of the brain dated [**2123-6-7**], also seen on the prior CT perfusion from [**2123-6-9**].
No hemorrhagic transformation is seen.
CT- HEAD [**6-11**] IMPRESSION: Evolving left hemispheric watershed infarcts, with no evidence of hemorrhagic conversion.
No new acute process is seen.
No obstruction or free air.
Bibasilar atelectasis and pleural effusions.
Labs at discharge:   Brief Hospital Course: NEURO: STROKE 83 yo RHW with h/o L CEA [**2123-5-25**] presented with transient episodes of R hand and arm numbness and speech difficulties.
She had a transient episode of right hand numbness that spread over the right arm and face over seconds to minutes, followed by difficulty using the right hand, disorientation and difficulties speaking.
Neuro exam was significant for right pronator drift and slowness with finger tapping.
CTA showed bilateral carotids had no significant stenosis.
At that concern, neuro team was concerned for hyper- or reperfusion syndrome s/p L CEA.
It was therefore recommended to keep her blood pressure well controlled (SBP<160) and stop the heparin drip given risk of edema and hemorrhage.
EEG was performed to rule out seizure.
On evening rounds, she had some slowness in right hand fast finger movements.
Neurology nightfloat saw the patient, however at that point it was still unclear whether this episode was due to developing stroke or seizure secondary to hyperperfusion syndrome.
The patient's blood pressure was being kept controlled between sBP 100-120 for concern of hyperperfusion syndrome.
At 4am, patient was R hemiplegic and aphasic.
CT with perfusion done at that time showed ischemia in the L anterior and posterior watershed borderzones.
CTA showed small plaque in the proximal L common carotid artery.
There was no hemorrhage.
She was started on heparin drip again for concern of L CCA plaque.
MRI showed watershed infarct in the L MCA-PCA borderzone and internal borderzone superiorly.
The most likely cause is a mechanical event at the L carotid post-operatively, that transiently blocked the vessel and made the brain suspectible to watershed stroke.
Repeat CT of the Head did not show hemorrhagic conversion and the patient was started on heparin, however transient thrombocytopenia and dropping HCT (likely from GI bleed), led to discontinuation of anticoagulation.
However, she developed a rash and this medication was stopped.
She was also briefly started on lepirudin, but another rash led to discontinuing these medications as well.
Repeat falling HCT and concern for GI bleed led to discontinuation of all anticoagulation other than aspirin.
HIT antibodies were positive, however the optical density of this test was low and suggestive of a false positive result.
GI: Rectal guiaic was positive without [**Month/Year (2) **] blood, however NG lavage was negative.
She then underwent upper and lower endoscopy which revealed "A few small angioectasias with stigmata of recent bleeding seen in the second part of the duodenum.
A gold probe was applied for hemostasis successfully."
There was melena found in the ascending colon during this colonoscopy.
On the night after the procedure, she developed abdominal pain (worse in the RLQ) that was concerning for possible post-procedure complications.
KUB did not show free air and the pain decreased over the next 2 days without interventions.
Her diet was advanced without complication prior to her discharge.
7. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for headache.
8. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
NEUROLOGIC EXAM: Residual right arm weakness, with distal weakness predominant ([**12-16**] FE, [**2-13**] WE)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the [**Hospital3 **] Medical center for numbness and weakness in your arm.
You had a polyp removed from you colon and small bleeding vessel was intervened on in your stomach.
After this you had some abdominal pain that appeared to resolve without intervention.
