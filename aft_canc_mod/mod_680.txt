Admission Date:  [**2167-3-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2167-4-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-8-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Percocet / Novocain / Lidocaine / Propofol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**] Chief Complaint: Fever, abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: TAH BSO 3 weeks prior ([**2167-3-5**])  History of Present Illness: 68 yo F w/recent TAH BSO [**2167-3-5**] who presents c/o fever, RUQ/epigastric pain.
In ED, noted to have low grade temperature (Tm 100.5), otherwise normotensive, not tachycardic, tachypneic or hypoxic.
Initial labwork revealed nl CBC, chem-7 (except for low potassium), but elevated LFTs - ALT 184, AST 217, alk phos 323, nl bilirubin, LDH 3000.
RUQ u/s was done to further evaluate which showed thickening of GB wall w/edema without frank cholecystitis; it also revealed multiple hypoechoic rounded liver lesions worrisome for metastases.
A CTA confirmed LAD but did not show evidence of pulmonary embolus.A HIDA scan was obtained, preliminary result negative per ED resident.
Of note, an abdominal CT was done as an outpatient for evaluation of abdominal pain which showed: .
IMPRESSION: 1) Diffuse enlarged lymphadenopathy throughout the hilar, paracardiac, paraesophageal, paragastric, porta hepatis, mesenteric, retroperitoneal, iliac, inguinal, and deep pelvic regions.
The greatest concentration of these abnormal nodes is superiorly in the paraesophageal and paragastric region.
This nodal burden taken in conjunction with the ring-enhancing lesions throughout the liver and the findings in the spleen, are extremely concerning for malignancy.
There may be a mass in the proximal stomach, though this may also represent an artifactual pseudotumor due to underdistension.
Diagnostic considerations include lymphoma and metastatic spread from primary esophageal or gastric tumor.
2) Multiple ring-enhancing hypodensities throughout the liver, concerning for metastases.
3) Multiple wedge-shaped hypodensities throughout the spleen, consistent with infarct versus metastases.
4) No evidence of acute postoperative complication; no evidence of bowel obstruction, significant hematoma, or active arterial bleeding.
Post-surgical changes at the site of the previous hysterectomy.
5) No suspicious lesions seen throughout the lung bases or osseous structures, though dedicated chest CT and bone scan is recommended if clinically warranted.
The patient was informed of the concern for possible malignancy given these findings.

2) Gallbladder wall thickening and edema.
The gallbladder is not distended, however, without stones, pericholecystic fluid or [**Doctor Last Name **] sign.
The gallbladder wall thickening and edema could be related to inflammatory processes within the right upper quadrant, including hepatitis, duodenitis or pancreatitis.
Also the etiology could be related to lymphatic obstruction due to lymphadenopathy within the porta hepatis.
There is no definite evidence of cholecystitis, though to completely exclude cholecystitis, a HIDA scan could be considered.
----  [**3-30**]:CTA CHest:IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
2) Extensive lymphadenopathy within the mediastinum, hila, axillae, epiphrenic and periaortic regions.
Given the calcified hilar lymph nodes, sarcoidosis could be a diagnostic consideration.
In reviewing the findings of the recent abdominal CT, metastatic disease is a consideration.
3) Small nodular opacities along the bronchovascular bundle likely represent additional small lymph nodes.
---- [**3-30**]:CXR:IMPRESSION: New bilateral hilar and right mediastinal lymphadenopathy, concerning for metastases.
----  [**4-6**]:CXR:IMPRESSION: Worsening left retrocardiac opacity, most likely due to atelectasis and adjacent pleural effusion.
----  [**4-8**]:CXR:Unchanged appearance of left lower lobe consolidation/collapse.
--- [**4-9**]:CT abd/pelvis:IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
2) The patient's NG tube is positioned with its distal tip within the second portion of the duodenum causing significant mass effect upon the posterolateral wall of the duodenum.
This tube should be withdrawn approximately 5 cm to avoid iatrogenic lesion of the duodenal mucosa.
3) New anasarca as well as free fluid within the pelvis and small bilateral pleural effusions.
4) Atelectasis versus consolidation within the left lower lobe that is new when compared to [**2167-3-26**].
5) Large spleen with areas of focal hypodensity better assessed on the recent contrast CT from [**2167-3-26**].
Low attenuation lesions within the liver as well as retroperitoneal and periportal lymph node enlargement are also better assessed on this prior study.
Brief Hospital Course: # Lymphoma: Pt was found to have physical exam c/w lymphoma/LAD, as well as elevated LFTs, LDH >3000, diffuse LAD on chest/abd CT.  She had also been having low grade fevers at home.
Given this, concern for malignancy was high.
Pt had biopsy of cervical LN which returned as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell type.
She was also having a rapid rise in her lactic acid, uric acid, and LDH levels.
She was very high risk for tumor lysis syndrome, so she initially had ABGs and electrolytes/lactate monitored every 2 hours.
After her chemo was completed, her tumor lysis labs were measured daily and remained stable.
BMT believed she had a good prognosis to recover from her lymphoma, however, overall, her prognosis including her active infections, respiratory failure, and ultimate unresponsiveness precluded any chance of full recovery.
# Respiratory distress/Resp compensation for met acidosis: On presentation, she was breathing fairly rapidly and deeply to compensate for her severe metabolic acidosis.
The only concern was the large amt of fluids she had received in the face of severe distress and low UOP in her first few days in the ICU.
Given the fact that her acidosis resolved with chemo though, and her ability to easily breathe on no vent support, she was extubated on [**4-5**].
However, she developed respiratory distress on [**4-6**] and was re-intubated with unclear etiology with the development of stridor and likely CHF exacerbation.
She had a diaphragm bedside study on [**4-10**] which showed no paradoxical movement of the diaphragm.
She remained intubated with failure to wean for 2 weeks despite diuresis and treatment of a LLL consolidation on CXR and confirmed by CT.
Thus, the patient was bronched on [**4-18**] which showed evidence of tracheo-bronchitis, so voriconazole was added to her course in addition to IV acyclovir with oral HSV lesions.
No evidence of PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient had a repeat bronch on [**4-22**] which showed significant bronchitis only mildly improved since Friday and the patient was kept on caspofungin with fungal cultures negative as her airways resembled "rotting ground beef" and appeared fungal in nature.
# Lactic acidosis: This is a typical finding in lymphoma.
In the BMT unit, she was changed to vancomycin/levofloxacin as she was acutely ill, and team was concerned about possible continued infection/or possibility of re-infection of her abdominal wound(followed by surgery, vac dressing).
Continued these initially in ICU, but then the levofloxacin was stopped, as main concern was for infection of abd wound with gram + skin organisms.
She was having interemittent fevers, initially believed to be due to her disease process.
Multiple urine and blood cultures (as well as sputum) were sent which showed no growth.
Her antibiotic coverage was empiric in the setting of febrile neutropenia and LLL consolidation which resolved on CXR.
- A CT torso showed splenic lesions c/w infarct, w/ no clear evidence of infectious source.
- changed CVL on [**4-14**] - Had been persistently febrile up to few days ago, Likely cause was secondary to her LLL consolidation/pneumonia + suspected HSV/candidal bronchitis or even her lymphoma.
# Abdominal Wound:She had  a vac dressing in place which was followed and changed as needed by surgical service.
They did not believe that this wound was currently infected, but it was watched closely and ppx vancomycin was administered and continued as empiric coverage with no positive blood cultures in the setting of her febrile neutropenia.
# .Low UOP/Renal:Pt initially had a low urine output.
For this reason, a large amt of fluid was administered in first several days that pt was in ICU.
An echo was done which showed hyperdynamic EF and a mildly hypertrophic LV.
Concern was for possible diastolic CHF.
#hypertension - on IV lopressor and hydralazine titrate to BP <160 #fluid status/diastolic heart failure:clinically euvolemic - will aim for goal even for now since she had metabolic alkalosis from contraction after she was diuresed 19 liters over 3 weeks.
# mental status: unresponsive post extubation.
As a result, a CT of the head was obtained which showed a small subdural hematoma.
She developed declining mental status on [**4-27**] and goals of care were re-addressed.
