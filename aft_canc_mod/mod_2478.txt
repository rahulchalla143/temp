Patient was initially diagnosed with rectal CA in [**2115**], has had resection of the primary and numerous attempts at chemo and radiation for metastatic disease (see below).
Patients reports that he was in his USOH until 3-4d ago, when he developed diffuse abdominal pains, as well as pains in his lower chest bilaterally.
He also notes the onset of dyspnea to the point of not being able to walk over the past 3d, with no cough or wheezing.
He reports no palpitations, no change in his LE edema.
Reports recent diarrhea and loss of appetite, with no vomiting, no BRBPR or melena.
Today, he kept his first appointment at the [**Hospital **] Clinic to be evaluated for his diabetes, and he was found to be in respiratory distress and unable to stand because of dyspnea and chest pain.
He complained of [**7-9**] pain in his belly, desaturating with exertion.
VBG 7.49/38/30 on suplemental oxygen, with lactate 4.7, LFTs, amylase, lipase elevated, resulting in concern for pancreatitis.
Past Medical History: 1. carcinoma of the rectosigmoid junction and rectum - s/p low anterior resection in [**2115**] - Neo adjuvant chemo radiation ([**2115**]) - Six cycles of CPT-11, 5-FU and leucovorin ([**2116**]) - Ostomy reversal ([**2116**]) - seven cycles of the [**Doctor Last Name **] regimen with Avastin ([**2116**]) - 6 week cycles of FLOX chemotherapy ([**2118**]) - VP shunt placed by neurosurgery ([**9-/2118**]) 2. hypertension 3. diabetes  Social History: The patient is originally from the [**Country 13622**] Republic, speaks excellent English, and prefes to read Spanish.
Father with diabetes  Physical Exam: VS: T 98.2, HR 100, BP 131/80, CVP 6, RR 27, Sat 96% on 4L at rest, Wt 92 kg GEN: ill-appearing, uncomfortable, jaundiced man, breathing rapidly and speaking in short sentences [**3-3**] dyspnea HEENT: EOMI, OP clear, MMM, JVP flat CV: tachy, regular, nl s1, s2, +s4, no murmur PULM: decreased BS throughout left side, rales in bottom [**Date range (1) 5082**] ABD: midline well-healed scars with no herniation; increased BS of normal pitch; tender in RUQ, epigastrium, LLQ; no rebound, no guarding; negative Murphys RECTAL: deferred, though guaiac neg by [**Doctor First Name **] exam EXT: warm, 2+ dp pulses BL, 1+ pitting edema bilaterally to calf NEURO: alert & oriented x 3; [**5-4**] hip flexors bilaterally, [**6-3**] dorsi- and plantar-flexion; symmetric 1+ patellar bilaterally; 1 beat of clonus of L ankle   Pertinent Results: .
[**2118-12-21**] CXR: Again demonstrated innumerable nodular densities throughout both lung fields representing advanced metastatic disease.
No definite areas of consolidation are identified.
There is also note of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
Interval progression of metastatic disease in the lungs and liver.
There is progression of innumerable lung metastases with notable conglomerate masses in the right lower lobe, measuring 3.6 x 2.3 cm, previously 2.5 x 1.7 cm.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Interval increase in left-sided pleural effusion.
There is peripancreatic stranding and stranding and small fluid tracking in the left and right anterior pararenal spaces.
Peripancreatic stranding with stranding and small fluid tracking along the right and left anterior pararenal spaces consistent with pancreatitis.
New right adrenal nodule and interval enlargement in a left upper pole renal lesion.
[**2118-12-21**] RUQ USN: gallbladder wall thickened though with no edema or hyperemia to suggest cholecystitis.
No stones or sludge.
No ductal dilitation.
Three cerebellar enhancing metastatic lesions are identified, two in the left cerebellar hemisphere and one in the right.
A/P: 58yo man with h/o met rectal CA to liver, lungs, brain, now p/w 3d of fatigue, SOB, abd pain, CP, diarrhea, found to have pancreatitis, increased mets in liver and lung, sepsis.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin, Zosyn, Flagyl) for concern for pancreatitis/ascending cholangitis.
His hypoxia was thought to be secondary to his multiple pulmonary metastases as well as worsening left pleural effusion.
He was started on a Morphine PCA for both his severe abdominal pain as well as symptom management of his severe dyspnea.
His elevated LFTs were thought to be [**3-3**] to his liver metastases.
Pain and palliative care was consulted for assistance with pain control, and symptom management as well as possible discussion of hospice/palliation.
Pt was started on morphine gtt for comfort on [**12-25**], as he continued to have considerable pain with morphine PCA.
