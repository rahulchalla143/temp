Admission Date:  [**2149-1-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-1-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2076-10-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: weight loss  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: liver biopsy ETT placement EGD x2  History of Present Illness: 72yo M no significant PMH presents with elevated WBC and history of 30lb weight loss since [**Month (only) 205**].
Pt presented to PCP for these complaints on [**1-6**].
Endorsed abdominal pain, loss of appetite, shortness of breath on exertion and weakness.
He has occasional nausea but no vomiting.
Pt has had very thin stools over the last 3 months, normal in color and much less than usual.
Has never had a colonoscopy.
Was scheduled for endoscopy this Thursday but after labs checked at PCP appt and found to have WBC 18.6, elevated LFTs so was sent to ED.
Exam concerning for crackles in L lung base, abd with firm, nontender epigastric mass palpated subcostally and firm palpable liver edge, no abd distension, no rebound/guarding.
CT A/P done, prelim with Diffuse liver and lung metastases, with mild abdominal ascites, of unknown primary.
No biliary dilatation.
CXR with multiple lesions concernign for metastatic disease.
Currently, pt denies any complaints other than stress about possible diagnosis of cancer.

Widespread metastases to the lung and liver of unclear primary.
Tubular hypodense structures in the left lobe of the liver could represent either possible left portal vein thrombosis or mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation and may be better assessed with ultrasound if indicated.
While these may represent bone islands, given the concern for metastatic disease, a bone scan could be used to further evaluate these findings.
Moderate ascites.
Bidirectional flow is seen within the main portal vein in the porta hepatis.
Mediastinal lymph nodes measure up to 8 mm in the perivascular station, 11 mm right lower paratracheal station, in the left hilum up to 8 mm, in the right hilum up to 5 mm, lower paraesophageal lymph node measures 11 mm.
There are mild calcifications in the LAD.
There is mild cardiomegaly.
There is no pleural effusion.
There is trace of pericardial effusion.
There are innumerable lung nodules and masses, consistent with metastases.
More distally, a conglomerate of lung nodules in the right lower lobe measures 4.7 x 4 cm.
This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
Please refer for more detailed description of abdominal findings in prior abdomen CT from [**1-7**].
IMPRESSION: Extensive metastatic disease in the chest and visualized upper abdomen.
Two enhancing lesions, one each in the right cerebellum and left frontal lobe which are suggestive of metastases.
Generalized cerebral atrophy with changes of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
No acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage.
Pulmonary metastatic disease is seen with large masses identified in the lower lobes bilaterally.
Diffuse replacement of the liver with metastatic disease with most notable disease burden noted within segment V of the liver surrounding the gallbladder, where there is a mass arising from the its medial wall.
Multifocal narrowing of the intrahepatic biliary tree, most notably the first and second order branches of the left intrahepatic biliary system, most likely caused by extrinsic compression of these bile ducts due to the large masses within the liver, rather than from a lesion arising from the bile ducts itself.
Attenuated intra-hepatic portion of the IVC and right and left hepatic veins.
EGD [**1-14**]: Findings: Esophagus:  Excavated Lesions A single clean-based but somewhat atypical appearing non-bleeding 15 mm ulcer was found at the gastroesophageal junction.
Overlying the ulcer was a white plaque.
In addition, there were multiple large clots in the fundus.
No source of active bleeding was identified, although views were somewhat obscured.
Duodenum:  Protruding Lesions A non-bleeding 12 mm polypoid mass was found at the second part of the duodenum just proximal to the ampulla.
Once the entire clot had passed through the stent, no additional clot or fresh blood was noted to exit the stent.
Other findings: Fresh blood was noted to be oozing from an area of mildly nodular mucosa in the duodenal bulb.
Impression: Ulcer in the gastroesophageal junction Blood in the whole stomach Clot was seen extruding from the known biliary stent Mass in the second part of the duodenum Fresh blood was noted to be oozing from an area of mildly nodular mucosa in the duodenal bulb.
Additional notes: The estimated blood loss from the procedure is 5cc.
There was no source of active bleeding identified on this study to the third portion of the duodenum.
EGD [**1-16**]:Esophagus:  Mucosa: Clean based 8mm erosion/ulceration seen at GE junction without evidence of bleeding.
Old blood mixed with mucous was found in the fundus which was suctioned away to reveal the mildly nodular mucosa.
No ulcers or other sites of bleeding could be found.
Protruding Lesions Many small gastric polyps were found in the body of the stomach.
Duodenum:  Other The two doudenal bulb clips were in place without evidence of bleeding.
The stent was found in the second part of the duodenum without evidence of active bleeding, old blood or clot.
Impression: Abnormal mucosa in the esophagus Polyps in the stomach Abnormal mucosa in the stomach The two doudenal bulb clips were in place without evidence of bleeding.
The stent was found in the second part of the duodenum without evidence of active bleeding, old blood or clot.
No active bleeding was seen.
There was no mass or tumor seen in the stomach.
The small nodules are likely benign fundic gland polyps.
If there is further bleeding would consider IR for potential hemobilia.
Estimated blood loss = zero.
No specimens were taken for pathology   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1022**] is a 72 year old male with no significant history who presented with weight loss, leukocytosis and diffuse liver lesions and was found to have widely metastatic adenocarcinoma from unknown primary.
Hospital course was complicated by cholangitis with subsequent biliary stent placement and profuse GI hemorrhage.
# Gastrointestinal (GI) bleed: He developed a large volume GI bleed while on the floor.
The cause for the bleed was not definitively identified after 2 endoscopies, however, large clot burden was found in the biliary stent placed for cholangitis.
It was thought that he was bleeding from his biliary system [**3-6**] necrosis of his large tumor burden.
Because of his worsening clinical status and subsequent decompensation, a goals of care discussion was had with the family and he was ultimately made DNR/DNI with comfort measures only.
# Metastatic adenocarcinoma: The patient was initially admitted to floor for work up of his weight loss and imaging showed diffuse liver lesions, with liver biopsy confirming adenocarcinoma.
# Cholangitis/sepsis: During admission, he developed fevers and right upper quadrant pain.
This found extrinsic compression of the biliary tree by tumor burden and a plastic stent was placed to open the drainage.
Once he developed bleeding from the stent (as above) his leukocytosis worsened and it was thought likely that he had re-obstruction of the biliary tree either by clot or tumor progression.
During this time, his lactate also increased to 14 and his pressor requirment increased.
# Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS):  After an episode of hypotension he developed laboratory abnormalities which were consistent with TLS.
We suspected that his hypotension had caused tumor necrosis given his extensive tumor burden.
Unfortunately, his TLS labs continued to trend upwards and he developed renal failure from TLS.
# Acute renal failure: Secondary to TLS as above.
Also likely that periods of hypotension led to acute tubular necrosis, accounting for his decreasing urine output, as well as increasing creatinine.
