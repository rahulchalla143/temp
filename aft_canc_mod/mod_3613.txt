Ultrasound 12/19:04: 1. normal venous blood flow, no portal vein thrombosis 2. left lobe biliary ductal dilatation without central or bile duct dilatation, unchanged 3. small ascites 4. diffuse liver metastatic disease  Mesenteric Angiogram [**2134-11-21**]: IMPRESSION: SMA and celiac arteriograms demonstrating no evidence of active GI bleeding.
The portal vein was patent without evidence of obvious varices.
No intervention performed.
Erythema in the whole stomach.

He had an EGD which showed a large blood clot in stomach and grade I varices in the lower third of the stomach.
Octreotide gtt was started [**11-21**] per GI recommendations but stopped [**11-22**] after repeat EGD showed no active bleeding.
Mesenteric angiogram was negative for any active bleeding and no intervention was performed.
A repeat EGD [**11-22**] showed grade I varices, portal gastropathy, and gastritis but no ulcer, including in fundus of stomach.
Abdominal ultrasound was negative for clot in portal vein and showed no ascites.
Gastroenterology felt that the bleeding was most likely secondary to his gastritis rather than the varices, though nadolol was added and maintained at discharge as well as a 6 week course of PO protonix [**Hospital1 **] and then daily indefinitely.
Colon cancer metastatic to liver - The patient's chemotherapy agents were discontinued and he will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] regarding when to restart his Xeloda (2 weeks on, 1 week off).
