HEENT: NC/AT, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally Cardiac: RRR Abdomen: soft.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
He was confused with two step commands (told him with his left hand to point to himself and then to the curtain).
Speech was hypophonic and slightly dysarthric.
Right eye; right inferior quadrant deficit, not detected on the left.
Right pronator drift .
No  tremor, asterixis noted.
-Sensory: Decreased vibration b/l to the ankles.
-Coordination: No ataxia on FNF  bilaterally.
No other areas of significant narrowing, thrombus, or aneurysm are present.
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy measuring up to 13 mm in short axis diameter.
Given a history of bladder cancer in this patient, close followup or further evaluation is recommended.
Multiple embolic infarcts throughout the brain, primarily in the left MCA territory and, to a lesser extent, PCA territory.
There are also possible punctate foci of acute infarction in the left cerebellum, right frontal lobe, and right occipital lobe.
No definite evidence of acute hemorrhage.
Solitary punctate focus of "blooming" artifact in the left parietal lobe on the gradient echo sequence is non-specific.
[**10-11**] TTE The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to apical anteroseptal/anterior hypokinesis/akinesis.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Small recent infarcts in the left temporal and occipital lobes, as seen on MRI one day earlier.
Numerous smaller recent infarcts seen on the MRI are not visualized on this exam.
No new sizeable infarct is seen.
New gyriform hyperdensities in the medial temporal lobe and left frontal lobe which could represent new petechial hemorrhages or mineralization, though no associated acute infarcts are seen.
[**10-11**] NCHCT IMPRESSION: New left parenchymal frontal hemorrhage with mass effect.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: This is a very unusual progression, and given the lobar nature of the hemorrhage, with no evidence of acute infarction in this region on the recent MR, and early blood/fluid level, is suggestive of underlying CAA, perhaps exacerbated by anticoagulation.
Allowing for the blood layering along the left temporal lobe, there is likely no true left uncal herniation.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: This study demonstrates continued unusual progression, and given the lobar nature of the hemorrhage, with no evidence of acute infarction in this region on the recent MR, and early formation of blood/fluid level, and, despite the intraventricular component (said to be atypical), is highly suggestive of underlying CAA, perhaps exacerbated by anticoagulation.
Allowing for the blood layering along the left temporal lobe, there is likely no true left uncal herniation.
Brief Hospital Course: 85yoRHM h/o CAD s/p BMS, bladder CA, diverticulosis p/w nonfluent aphasia s/p likely embolic from PAF.
[] Acute Cerebral Infarction - The patient presented initially to an outside hospital after a fall when trying to get up to go to the bathroom, but no further history is available from the outside facility.
On exam he had a nonfluent aphasia with some inattentiveness and right inferior quadrantonopia.
He was found to have a left M1 occlusion with distal filling of the MCA distribution on a CTA.
Given the time of presentation to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he was not a candidate for iv TPA, ia TPA, or mechanical clot retrieval due to being outside of the time window.
In accordance with a discussion with his primary cardiologist, his antithrombotic therapy was changed from a full-dose aspirin and clopidogrel to ASA 81, Clopidogrel 75, and a heparin infusion without bolus with goal 50-70 with the impression that the M1 occlusion was from an embolic source which later was shown to have caused bilateral embolic cerebral infarctions in multiple vascular territories on MRI.
A TTE did not reveal a cardiac source of embolus.
The patient's level of awareness and consciousness remained impaired out of proportion to the size of his infarctions, suggesting a broader degree of ischemia that was evident as completed infarction on his MRI.
The decision was made to keep him on dual antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation to prevent complete occlusion of the M1 segment.
[] Intracerebral/Intracranial Hemorrhage - During the course of anticoagulation for embolic stroke, the patient was noted to have a PTT that elevated quickly from the 71.7 to 103.9 with possible suggestion of petechial hemorrhages on an NCHCT obtained to evaluate the area of completed infarction.
A subsequent NCHCT revealed that he developed a left frontal lobar hemorrhage that did not correspond to a prior area of infarction seen on prior imaging.
In discussion with Radiology, his MRI on further review showed subtle signs suggestive of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, the most likely etiology of his hemorrhage.
[] Goals of care - The patient's level of consciousness was significantly impaired at the time of arrival and worsened in the setting of the spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage and subsequent completion of his L MCA stroke (off anticoagulation and antiplatelets, the entire left MCA territory infarcted).
