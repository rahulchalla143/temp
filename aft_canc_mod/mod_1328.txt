Admission Date:  [**2155-7-9**]       Discharge Date:  [**2155-7-14**]   Service:  Medicine  DISPOSITION:  [**Hospital3 **] Center for Aged  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient was admitted on [**7-9**] with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleed.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 88 year old female with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, prolymphocytic type and pulmonary hypertension who presents with epistaxis to the Emergency Department.
A chest x-ray was performed that showed bilateral pleural effusions and some concern for aspiration versus congestive heart failure.
The patient's nose was packed with Gelfoam and the bleeding was controlled.
The patient also complained of intermittent abdominal pain.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient was noted to have a few weeks of anorexia and fatigue.
She denied chest pain, abdominal pain and any other pain in the Emergency Department, but she did complain of shortness of breath.
In the Emergency Department she also received 20 mg of intravenous Lasix and Vitamin K.  Her nose was packed with Gelfoam and the bleeding was stopped.
An nasogastric tube was placed and a nasogastric lavage was done which returned 50 to 100 cc of coffee ground which cleared.
There were no signs of active upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
The coffee grounds were thought secondary to the swallowing of the nosebleed.
Prolymphocytic leukemia, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Rectal prolapse with vaginal pessary.
Peptic ulcer disease, presumptive diagnosis secondary to gastroesophageal reflux disease.
ALLERGIES:  Allergies to anesthesia which "caused an myocardial infarction postoperatively."
The patient is Do-Not-Resuscitate, Do-Not-Intubate.
She has cataracts and dry mucous membranes.
There is a II/VI holosystolic murmur at the left upper sternal border.
Lungs, bibasilar rales, right greater than left.
Extremities, trace pitting edema of the ankles.
Rectal examination is grossly guaiac positive with maroon stool.
KUB film, nonspecific bowel gas pattern, gallstones are present with no free air.
Chest x-ray, tortuous calcified aorta, cardiomegaly, congestive heart failure with effusions, elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
Electrocardiogram, normal sinus rhythm, left axis deviation, T wave inversions in 3 and AVF, V1 and V3, poor R wave progression.
ASSESSMENT:  An 88 year old female with bright red blood per rectum, nasogastric lavage with coffee grounds that cleared.
PLAN:  The gastrointestinal bleed is likely a lower gastrointestinal bleed, most likely causes are arteriovenous malformation or diverticulosis.
The patient will be treated conservatively with supportive measures including blood transfusions and a close hemodynamic monitoring.
A DIC panel was sent for evaluation of clotting disorder secondary to the chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
On discharge she was still having trace guaiac positive stool.
Lasix was given as needed for pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure symptoms.
When the patient received her blood transfusions she was given Lasix after each transfusion as she did manifest some symptoms concerning for congestive heart failure and volume overload.
The patient did have crackles on examination and was given Lasix for volume overload as noted in the cardiovascular hospital course.
There were no other significant pulmonary events.
From an Oncology perspective, the patient has prolymphocytic leukemia.
The Oncology Consulting Service did not think the chronic lymphocytic leukemia contributed to any bleeding diathesis contributing to the patient's presentation.
The patient will also be screened for depression by her primary care doctor.
Lower gastrointestinal bleed, either arteriovenous malformation or diverticulosis 2.
Hypertension 3.
Pulmonary hypertension requiring oxygen 4.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia prolymphocytic type 5.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease  PLAN:  Discharge the patient on [**7-14**] in stable condition.
