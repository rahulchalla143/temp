Sepsis: The pt was found to be hypotensive and febrile in the ED and admitted through sepsis protocol.
Blood cultures were found to be positive for gram postive cocci which was ultimately shown to be VRE.
The pt remained hypotensive on pressors for the next several days and a work-up was initiated to determine the source of infection.
MRI of the foot was pursued to r/o osteomyelitis, and a CT of the abdomen was down to r/o an abdominal source of infection.
The CT Abdomen and pelvis showed possible abscess in liver and spleen.
For the pancolitis, the pt was kept NPO and he was treated for possible c. diff infection while c. diff cultures were sent and found to be positive.
A RUQ U/S [**2135-2-2**] was pursued which showed evidence of hypoechoic lesion could be flegmon or mass.
IR was [**Date Range 4221**] for possible drainage or biopsy, however option declined given localization of lesions and the pts significant bleeding risk.
The GI team suggested an MRI to further evaluate the liver lesions although this was unable to be pursued because the pt was too unstable requiring pressors for bp support.
A TTE Echo was done to r/o endocarditis or abscess and was negative.
Head CT was negative for abscess as well.
Despite giving pain medicines he has shown signs of a lot of discomfort.
We explained to the family that we would need a NGT place in order to feed him and give him some of his medicines now that he is having trouble swallowing given his mental status.
His blood pressure was in the 80s-90s systolic off pressors and his extremities continued to show evidence of perfusion.
At 2:08 am he was found to have ceased respirations and was without a heart rate on the monitor.
BB and BP medications were held in the setting of hypotension .
Peripheral vascular disease: continued plavix, Aspirin until CMO The vascular team followed the pt.
ESRD: The pt continued to recieve periodic dialysis sessions while in house until he was made CMO.
