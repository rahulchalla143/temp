Pelvic exam revealed an enlarged uterus.
She recently underwent examination and D&C with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14727**] which showed multiple vaginal tumors.
A biopay of two of the vaginal lesions revealed squamous cell carcinoma.
She also mentioned that she had an attempted colonoscopy, but this was unsuccessful due to difficulty in passing the colonoscope.

HISTORY: 52-year-old female now postop day 3 with tachycardia and hypoxia.
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no pathologic mediastinal, axillary or hilar lymphadenopathy.
There are new small bilateral pleural effusions with associated bibasilar atelectasis.
The previously identified 9 mm subpleural lingular lesion is now less prominent and likely represented inflammatory change.
There has been no significant change in right paraspinal soft tissue nodules adjacent to T4 and T5.
Limited evaluation of the abdomen demonstrates a new small amount of perihepatic ascites.
The previously identified hepatic lesions are better seen on CT of [**2121-4-2**] due to differences in contrast timing.
CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CHEST: There are filling defects of the basal segmental arteries of the left lower lobe indicative of pulmonary embolism.
There is subtle mosaic perfusion at the apices bilaterally which could be compatible with tiny emboli or less likely hypersensitivity due to a drug reaction.
The aorta is of normal caliber without evidence of aneurysm or dissection.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are identified.
Pulmonary emboli of the left lower lobe basal segmental arteries.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated bibasilar atelectasis.
No significant change in right paraspinal soft tissue nodules along T4 and T5.
New small amount of perihepatic ascites.
Hepatic metastases better seen on CT [**2121-4-2**] due to differences in timing of contrast.

Cellulitis versus abscess.
No lung nodules are identified.
CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: Multiple hypodense lesions likely metastases are again identified in the liver.
There is a new ascites throughout the abdomen and pelvis.
Adjacent to the aorta near the left renal vein is a hypodense 3-cm mass, again likely metastatic disease.
Within the mid abdomen is a focal un-drainable fluid collection.
A similar collection is seen more inferiorly.
Free flowing ascites present about the liver and runs along both paracolic gutters.
There is a small amount of left perinephric fluid.
There is a small free fluid in the pelvis.
The patient is status post removal of a large uterine mass.
BONE WINDOWS: No lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
New fluid fluid throughout abdomen and pelvis, though continued follow- up may be helpful if symptoms persist to exclude organizing collection.
Metastatic disease as described above.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2121-4-26**] 2:55 PM  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  Reason: Abd/Pelvis with contrast to assess for peritonitis, abscess, Field of view: 38 Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 52 year old woman POD#12 s/p hyst/signmoid colectomy with reanastomosis with peritoneal cancer with spiking fevers and unknown source REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Abd/Pelvis with contrast to assess for peritonitis, abscess, anastamotic leak CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: 52-year-old woman post-operative day 12, status post hysterectomy and sigmoido-colectomy with re-anastomosis with peritoneal cancer, now spiking fevers of unknown source.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial images from the lung bases through the pubic symphysis were acquired with intravenous and oral contrast material and displayed with 5-mm slice thickness.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is stable atelectasis and small pleural effusions at the lung bases.
The amount of abdominal ascites has increased slightly compared to yesterday.
Multiple hypoattenuating liver lesions appear unchanged.
No evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis is seen.
There is contrast material throughout the small bowel.There is a single slightly dilated small bowel loop (3.6 cm).
No small bowel wall thickening is seen.
There is contrast material in the colon which presumably represents contrast from the prior study as it exhibits higher density values than the small bowel.
The colonic loops appear unremarkable without wall thickening or pneumatosis.
There are tiny amounts speckled contrast material layering on top of the bladder, in proximity of the anastomis, suggestive of anastomotic leak, although the exact location of the extravasation cannot be determined.
Multiple pockets of ascites are scattered throughout the mesentery, which have not significantly changed compared to yesterday.
The descending aorta and its major tributaries appear patent.
There is stable 3- cm left retroperitoneal mass representing metastasis.
Note is made of significantly increased free air within the anterior abdomen, around the porta hepatis, and in multiple locations in the mesentery, increasing the suspicion for leak/perforation.
The appearance of the midline incision appears unchanged without evidence of new dehiscence.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The amount of pelvic ascites is approximately stable.
There is a small amount of air in the bladder, presumably to recent catheterization.
Small bowel loops in the pelvis appear unremarkable.
These findings are suggestive of a leak or bowel perforation, most likely an anstomotic leak.
Slight increase in amount of abdominal ascites.
Stable left retroperitoneal mass representing metastasis.
Brief Hospital Course: She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2121-4-14**] and went to the OR for a resection of a pelvic mass and sigmoid colectomy.
#Respiratory Failure She was intubated post-operatively with metabolic acidosis that improved on ventilation.
There were no signs of active bleeding.
She received several fluid boluses POD 2 for a low urine output.
At this point there was a concern for HIT due to low platelet count.
On [**2121-4-27**], POD 13, she received FFP prior to going to the OR for an urgent exploratory laparotomy.
She was treated with Adenosine 6mg x 1 dose that converted her to ST HR 115-117 with no ectopy.
She has a history of SVT and was previously treated with Adenosine.
Most likely the episode was due to increased catecholamine state and increased total circulating blood volume, possibly causing atrial stretch.
She continued to have tachycardic episode with HR >130bpm.
She was treated with Lopressor for tachy episodes and rate controlled.
She was started on a Heparin drip for evidence of a Pulmonary Embolism as seen on a CTA on POD 4.
The wound was healing well with staples in place.
No flatus for several days.
Blood cultures later showed no growth.
She also was having RLQ abdominal pain and increased generalized pain with no N/V.
A CT showed intraabdominal ascites and free air, but no evidence of a Pneumonia or pelvic abscess.
A surgery consult was obtained on [**2121-4-27**] for evaluation of free air and a small amount of oral contrast in peritoneum and question of an anastomotic leak.
There were no signs of sepsis.

Discharge Instructions: Please seek immediate medical attention if you have fever >101.4F, nausea or vomiting, shortness of breath, severe or persistent abdominal pain or bleeding, persistent redness around your surgical site, increased bruising or bleeding, new leg swelling, or any other worrisome symptoms.
