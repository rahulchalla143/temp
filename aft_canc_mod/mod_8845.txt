Name:  [**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname 126**]              Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 3495**]  Admission Date: [**2144-5-29**]        Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:  [**2074-1-31**]        Sex:  M  Service:  [**Last Name (un) 3496**]   Since the prior dictation, the [**Hospital 1325**] hospital course was prolonged secondary to episodes of tachycardia during ambulation.
His rate reached as high as 170 in a sinus tachycardia, but there was no evidence of hypotension or hemodynamic instability during these episodes.
He did not have an abnormally low hematocrit and it did not seem to be secondary to any sort of medication related problem.
We did touch base with his primary care physician who was also aware of persistent baseline tachycardia, although it had never been as high as 170.
It is felt that this was just secondary to the patient's mild deconditioning and recent inactivity.
