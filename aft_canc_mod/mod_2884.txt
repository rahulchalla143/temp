At the time of this GI bleed, upper endoscopy was performed, and this revealed evidence of a 6 cm submucosal mass in the antrum of the stomach with central ulceration and stigmata of recent bleeding.
This was felt to be consistent with a GI stromal tumor or leiomyoma and was felt to be the source of bleeding.
No other abnormality was noted in the esophagus, stomach or first 2 portions of the duodenum.
Preoperative CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed a well-defined mass in the antrum with attenuation consistent with fat.
