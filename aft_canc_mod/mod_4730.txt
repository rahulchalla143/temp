[**Name (NI) **] reports that he told his father he needed to go the [**Name (NI) **] on [**2142-6-23**] and drove him in to [**Hospital1 18**] after speaking with his oncologist.
Pt has had chest pain with coughing, non-exertional, non-pleuritic.
No recent hospitalizations.
On further questioning, patient does endorse history of wheezing with cold air.
Denies orthopnea or PND.
Of note, according to OMR patient was seen [**2142-6-5**] for chemo and was c/o cough and congestion.
He was triggered for being tachy to 130s and tachypneic to 30s, hypoxic to low 90s on RA.
Tight breath sounds with wheezes on exam.
Considered PE in differential but given infiltrate decided no CTA.
PCXR showed RLL infiltrate c/f PNA.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia.
Pt was transferred directly to the MICU from the ED because of worsening tachypnea and tachycardia.
Past Medical History: - metastatic lung cancer (pt not a smoker) ** See onc note form [**2141-11-7**] for entire oncology hx - benign sigmoid polyps - Hernia repair on [**2141-5-19**].
metastatic lung cancer (pt not a smoker)-history below --[**6-1**] CXR that revealed a 4 x 4 cm right middle lobe nodule.
---[**7-1**] CT scan revealed a 4.5 x 4.8 cm right perihilar mass as  well as numerous confluent right upper lobe nodules and subcarinal lymphadenopathy.
There were tiny contralateral nodules noted in the left lower lobe, none larger than 3 mm.
--[**7-1**] needle core biopsy of the right lung mass, which revealed  adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, consistent with non-mucinous bronchoalveolar carcinoma.
He was scanned serially approximately every three months while on Tarceva with no evidence of worsening disease until [**10/2140**] --[**11-3**] CT scan right perihilar mass was again noted to be as large as 4 x 4 cm.
Also in [**10/2140**], he developed visual changes in the right eye.
He was subsequently noted to have a large detachment of the macula with an oval choroidal lesion underneath  the superior temporal arcade in the right eye, presumably due to  metastatic disease.
--[**2-/2141**] CT scan revealed persistent right perihilar lung mass measuring 4.1 cm, multiple nodules in a right perihilar distribution GGO RML, 8 mm nodule in the right hepatic lobe, a 1.5 cm nodule immediately adjacent in the right hepatic lobe in a  subcapsular location, as well as a stable hepatic cyst, suspicious lymph node in the region of the gastrohepatic ligament  measuring 9 mm in short axis.
--[**2141-5-5**] worsening periumbilical pain.
CT scan revealed abnormal increased density in the inferior right hilum with a small right pleural effusion, a round area of decreased attenuation in the right lobe of the liver, which had the appearance of a cyst, and three rounded areas of decreased attenuation in the right lobe of the liver, which appeared to have increased in size when compared to the CAT scan done on [**2141-3-8**].
There were also small lesions in the left lobe of the liver.
--[**2141-5-19**] by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5877**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 19122**] for repair of an umbilical hernia.
Pathology revealed a metastatic well-to-moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the hernia sac and contents with  strong positivity for CK-7 and TTF-1 and negative for CK-20.
---[**2141-5-29**] ultrasounded-guided core biopsy of the liver revealed a metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with a lung primary of a bronchoalveolar type.
--[**2141-6-14**] PET CT: FDG avid right perihilar coalescent pulmonary  mass with satellite lesions and moderate pleural effusion.
Avid  supraclavicular, mediastinal and retroperitoneal adenopathy as  detailed.
Extensive omental caking.
--[**2141-6-14**] MRI brain: Proliferation of intraconal fat in the right orbit, with mild mass effect on the optic nerve, likely representing a sequela of known radiotherapy to this site.
No suspicious parenchymal, meningeal or bone lesion to suggest metastatic disease.
Stable appearance of liver, adrenal and omental metastatic  disease.
Significant interval worsening of multiple sclerotic bony lesions, mild interval worsening of moderate-to-large hyperenhancing right pleural effusion.
--[**2141-11-7**] started alimta maintenance --[**2142-1-19**] CT torso: Interval worsening hepatic metastatic lesions with increase in size and number of the metastatic deposits.
Stable to slightly decreased pulmonary disease.
Decrease in omental masses.
--[**2142-5-16**] CT torso, no appreciable change in the diffuse multiple bilateral small pulmonary nodules or right-sided pleural  effusion or mediastinal adenopathy.
There has been an increase  in the size and number of hepatic metastasis, the largest now to  44 mm from 31 and now there is a new lesion from segment III.
There is diffuse omental thickening and stranding consistent with  metastatic disease, which is present on prior study, but subjectively appears to have increased.
Bone windows again demonstrate metastatic disease with potentially a new 3 mm sclerotic focus at T8 and possibly L4.
- benign sigmoid polyps - Hernia repair on [**2141-5-19**] - h/o duodenitis - h/o thrombocytopenia   Social History: The patient is married with three children, ages18 to 36, all in the US.
Family History: No family history of lung cancer or other malignancies.

Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli as described.
Right upper opacity is mostly likely infectious with lower lobe atelectasis.
Right juxtahilar lesion and innumerable pulmonary metastases are increased with accompanying increased moderate pleural effusion.
Increased compression and possible invasion of left main stem bronchus by increased subcarinal soft tissue.
Limited evaluation for hemorrhage given recent IV contrast bolus through prior study.
No definite acute hemorrhage.
No definite mass lesion to suggest intracranial metastatic disease.
If there is ongoing clinical concern, MRI of the brain is recommended for increased sensitivity for detection.
There is no associated edema.
It is possible these are normal vessels on end, but in the setting of metastatic disease, the possibility of metastases should be considered.
Since contrast was given for a Chest CTA, the high density may reflect contrast enhancement, rather than hemorrhage or calcifictation.
Punctate focus of abnormal enhancement noted on the right cerebellar hemisphere and two small ring-enhancing lesions in the left cerebellar hemisphere, with no significant mass effect or edema.
Supratentorially, there are two small foci of abnormal enhancement in the left and right frontal lobes, with no evidence of mass effect or edema, these lesions are highly suspicious for metastatic disease.
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**6-23**] and [**6-24**]:  [**2142-6-24**] CXR Previous mild pulmonary edema has improved, most evident in the left lung.
Small right pleural effusion is larger.
Opacification at the base of the right lung could be the residual of edema and atelectasis, but there is a heterogeneous quality to it that raises concern for pneumonia.
The small lung nodules seen on that study are barely visible on this conventional bedside radiograph.

# Pulmonary emboli: Was Confirmed on CTA.
LE Ultrasound revealed bilateral DVTs.
Pt continued to be very wheezy on exam, not moving air well which implied element of bronchospasm also contributing to his respiratory symptoms.
#Possible Pneumonia: pt received broad spectrum antibiotics for HCAP and was later switched to Levofloxacin when his pneumonia was no longer concerning for HCAP.
He did meet SIRS criteria with tachypnea and tachycardia but had no evidence of septic shock.
# Lung cancer with obstructive endobronchial lesion: pt has broncheoalveolar carcinoma, known metastatic disease, and currently is receiving gemcitabine.
Head CT and Brain MRI revealed metastatic diesease.
Pt had elevated alk phos which was likely from bony metastases.
Mr [**Known lastname 34030**] will also follow up with interventional pulmonary next week, and as he has an endobronchial lesion that will require treatment to avoid lung collapse.
# Anemia: Patient's hematocrit was stable and did not trend downward.
Likely related to malignancy and/or Fe deficiency.
Prochlorperazine 10 mg PO Q6H:PRN nausea   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Pulmonary Emboli Deep venous thrombosis Pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted because of fevers and increased shortness of breath.
During your hospital stay it was discovered that you had blood clots in your lungs.
You will need to follow up with the Interventional Pulmonary Service for possible stenting of a possible blockage in the lung airways.
