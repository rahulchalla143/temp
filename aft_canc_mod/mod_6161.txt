Was feeling fine last night, presented to OSH with acute SOB.
ECG with lateral ST depression aVL, V4-V6.
Patient was put on NIPPV, received lasix 80mg x1, nitro gtt, was started on hep gtt, no floey 2/2 blood clots from urethra.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
All of the other review of systems were negative except for SOB, dysuria since radiation therapy started.
Past Medical History: - CAD s/p PCI (last [**1-1**]), no CABG - HTN - DM - CHF - COPD - recent surgery/chemo for vulvar CA - likely early dementia .
Cardiac Risk Factors: (+) Diabetes, (+) Dyslipidemia, (+) Hypertension  (+) Smoking history (+)family history  Cardiac History: CABG N/A  Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**1-/2140**] anatomy as follows: Cardiac cath: 1/3/3008 -95% LAD s/p 2 BMS stents; TIMI III flow, residual 0-10% narrowing Cardiac cath: [**2135-5-6**] -LMT 30% stenosis at origin -LAD 40% narrowing in mid-segment -LCx 30% stenosis.
-RCA: Proximal 90-95% eccentric severe stenosis with plaque ulcer.
Distal right coronary with mild plaque prior to origin of PDA.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
CV: distant HS, RRR, no murmurs, rubs,gallops, S3 appreciated Chest: Mildly tachypneic, crackled [**Hospital1 **]-basiler 1/2 up, L>R Abd: Obese, soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
There is a perihilar opacity with bilateral increased interstitial opacity consistent with mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
There is a confluent opacity within the lung bases bilaterally either representing confluent alveolar edema or aspiration or pneumonia.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated two vessel coronary artery disease.
The RCX had patent stents and an occluded posterolateral branch.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the stent, no dissection and TIMI III flow (See PTCA comments) FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Elevated left and right sided filling pressures.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid- to distal anterior and anteroseptal hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
A slightly-eccentric, posteriorly-directed jet of mild to moderate ([**1-27**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension   Brief Hospital Course: This is an 81 year old female with hx of CAD s/p MI and stents, CHF, HTN, DM, vaginal CA s/p resection/ChemoTx, rad tx before this admission, who presented from OSH with NSTEMI then had a second NSTEMI while here and went into respiratory distress.
# CAD/Ischemia:  Ms. [**Known lastname 78579**] presented with NSTEMI, plan was to send her for cardiac catheterization but she developed respirtory distress on the hospital floor and was intubated.
ECG and cardiac enzymes were positive which signified that she had a second NSTEMI while in the hospital.
She had no further symptoms during her stay, and her telemetry was unremarkable.
# Respiratory distress:  Patient went into respiratory distress secondary to NSTEMI as above.
Durint the episode she was also noted to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate which likely contributed to her respiratory decompensation.
Shortly after being intubated she became febrile and hypotensive.
# Hypertension:  Patient was hypotensive during respiratory distress which likely contributed to respiratory decompensation.
# Rhythm: Patient had atrial fibrillation with RVR s/p NSTEMI as above.
# Acute renal failure: Patient had acute renal failure likely due to atrial fibrillation and NSTEMI resulting in poor forward flow.
At time of discharge her creatinine was 1.0 and her renal failure had resolved.
# Valves: No known pathology  # COPD: Patient with history of COPD.
Her home COPD medications were restarted and she continued to have good oxygen saturation on room air (95%) and no reported difficulties breathing.
# Diabetes Mellitus: Patient has a history of diabetes on Lantus and Sliding scale at home.
# Vulvar cancer: There was concern during patient's stay that she had developed a recto-vaginal fistula during the time she had the c. difficile diarrhea.
A fistulogram was completed that did not demonstrate any evidence of fistula.
