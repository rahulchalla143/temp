Admission Date:  [**2110-2-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2110-3-6**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1148**] Chief Complaint: Fever, hypotension, diarrhea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] M with recent necrotizing cholecystitis s/p brief percutaneous cholecystotomy drainage, recent MI with CHF, was at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with fever 101.5, hypotension to SBP 70s, 7 episodes of diarrhea yesterday.
Per his daughter, he has been more combative with altered mental status at Heb Reb over the past few days.
He had been recuperating at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab using a walker, was alert, with generalized weakness, but last night after 7 diarrhea episodes, got out of bed at 7 pm, and at 8 pm, vitals were 70/40, T100.2.
The patient denies pain but states that he is dizzy.
On [**2110-1-23**], he was discharged from MICU West with necrotizing cholecystitis in the setting of an MI and CHF, so CCY was not performed and perc drain was placed instead on [**1-18**].
Patient pulled out the drain on [**1-22**], and surgery and IR felt that the tube should not be replaced.
Bile culture grew out GNR and Vanc sensitive Enterococcus.
US abdomen showed cholelithiasis but no cholecystitis, and a new left liver lobe 4 cm mass (radiology read was changed: the word "cystic" was deleted) with internal flow that does not look like an abscess.
H/o deep vein thrombophlebitis with chronic left venous stasis 5.
Cerebrovascular disease.
Gallstones and acute cholecystitis [**2093**] with multiple stones and obstructive jaundice, ERCP failed so had papillotomy 8.
Gastritis with GI bleeding [**5-7**] 10.
Inguinal hernia on R 12.
R carotid stenosis: 70-80% stenosis distal R carotid, 90% stenosis of suprabulbar R carotid 18.
He had an echocardiogram performed in [**2102**], which showed moderate ischemic myopathy with an ejection fraction of 45%, mild mitral and aortic regurgitation, and aortic sclerosis.
No EtOH, no smoking.
No gallbladder wall edema or pericholecysttic fluid to suggest acute cholecystitis.
New left liver lobe mass measuring up to 4 cm.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior, antero-septal and apical hypokinesis to akinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.19cm2) The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Moderate calcific aortic stenosis.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Large heterogeneous retroperitoneal mass is most likely a retroperitoneal sarcoma.
Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation and idstended gallbladder with wall edema, sludge and stones, ndpericholecystic fluid/stradning [**Month (only) 116**] be from external compression by the mass, although given presence of gallstones, choledocholisthiasis cannot be excluded.
Ultrasound is ulikely to give significant additional details, consider HIDA scan to assess for cystic duct patency.
Please correlate with recent instrumentation or prior sphincterotomy.
3.6-cm exophytic hypodensity arising off the mid left kidney.
Nonemergent further evaluation with ultrasound can be performed for additional characterization.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Mild-to-moderate congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions.
As such, there is very little drainage emanating from the pigtail catheter.
[**1-20**] CXR: Widespread pulmonary opacification which progressed between [**1-16**] and 17 is stable, accompanied by slightly larger small right pleural effusion.
The progression of findings suggests that the lung abnormalities are  due to edema, though not necessarily cardiogenic.
There is no pneumothorax.
In the upper abdomen one can see a dilated colon and a percutaneous biliary drainage catheter.
MRI abdomen: FINDINGS: There are small bibasilar effusions and atelectasis.
There are multiple heterogeneous, but predominantly T2- hyperintense, masses and nodules in the liver.
These include a large mass noted recently on ultrasound examination within the left lobe, which measures 3.4 x 4.7 x 4.3 cm (AP x transverse x vertical).
There is a similar, but somewhat smaller, 3-cm diameter mass within segment VI, as well as multiple additional lesions up to 1.6 cm in diameter.
All of these liver lesions are new since a CT performed on [**2110-1-16**].
A large intraluminal heterogeneous mass of 4.8 cm in diameter occupies the fundus of the gallbladder.
There is mass effect on adjacent dependent stones and sludge which are pushed medially.
A small amount of residual fluid is present within the gallbladder fossa.
Several sub-5 mm stones are visualized within the common hepatic and cystic ducts, but there is no intra- or extra- hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
A large portacaval mass is similar, to perhaps minimally increased in size, compared to the earlier CT appearance from [**2110-1-16**].
Its contour and location are most suggestive of a metastatic lymph node, centered at the expected site of a portcaval node.
The portocaval mass abuts the uncinate process, but does not necessarily arise from it.
Bilateral simple renal cysts are unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] M with recent necrotizing cholecystitis s/p brief percutaneous cholecystotomy drainage, recent MI with CHF [**1-8**], presented with fever 101.5, hypotension with SBP to 70s, 7 episodes of diarrhea, and found to have e coli severe sepsis most likely from newly found gallbladder cancer and obstruction.
# GNR sepsis: [**4-6**] blood cx positive for pan sensitive e coli at [**Hospital 882**] Hospital.
# Liver mass: Found on MRI to have rapidly enlarging RP/liver masses with mass near neck of gallbladder.
Had Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] review films and case at family's request and agreed most c/w gallbladder cancer with mets to liver.
Patient with some c/o pain and placed on morphine with some relief.
Also has had intermittent jaundice with T bili as high as 4.
# Cardiac ischemia: Has had multiple MIs, recurrent angina, RCA stenosis.
EF 25% after MI in [**1-8**].
Has had CHF with pulmonary edema and effusions on CXR, but euvolemic on exam.
Instead gave morphine in the evenings and will plan scheduled dose of morphine.
Patient needs work with his sleep/wake cycle and does better with Russian speaking sitters than with restraints.
# Anemia: Baseline Hct 33, currently at baseline.
Has had guaiac positive stool in past, but is still maintained on aggrenox and plavix, which are being held.
# Hematuria: In episode delirium patient pulled out foley with balloon up.
# FEN: Patient had swallow eval that recommended nectar thickened liquids.
Family aware of malignancy and grim prognosis.
