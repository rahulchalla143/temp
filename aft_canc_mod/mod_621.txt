TFTs TSH: 12 FT4: 1.1  Images: [**10-7**] Chest AP: Low lung volumes with known idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
While a subtle superimposed acute consolidation in the lung bases is difficult to exclude, it would be highly coincidental and is felt less likely with the increased opacity likely due to crowding.
Status post sternotomy, status post valvular replacement.
Unchanged evidence of a right basal opacity with a predominantly reticular pattern, that might, in part be, fibrotic.
These are likely to be related to the known history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
There is no evidence of fluid overload on the current image.
No pleural effusions.
No parenchymal opacities have newly occurred.
Emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis with mild bibasilar consolidations, worse on the right than the left, likely reflecting atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Cholelithiasis in a nondistended gallbladder with mild wall edema/pericholecystic fluid likely reflects either CHF or hypoproteinemia.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
No evidence of intra-abdominal free air or organized fluid collection.
Indistinct pancreatic head; correlate with pancreatic enzymes if clinical concern for pancreatitis.
Sludge and stones in the gallbladder neck without other findings to suggest acute cholecystitis.
If there is continued clinical concern, a HIDA scan may be more definitive in the exclusion of acute cholecystitis.
Dilated hepatic veins consistent with diastolic dysfunction .
No acute intracranial abnormality.
Small vessel ischemic disease and diffuse cerebral atrophy.
Atypical squamous cells.
Colonic polyp, distal ascending/proximal transverse (biopsy): 1.
Fragments of adenoma with focal high grade dysplasia.
FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2137-10-29**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 y.o woman with PMH of IPF,COPD,anemia, mechanical mitral valve,and pacemaker presents with worsening dyspnea, acute renal failure, and fluid overload.
Hemolysis labs negative, and rectal exam showed guiac positive brown stool.
Her anemia was believed to be secondary to a GI bleed.
She underwent EGD/colonoscopy which showed esophageal and fundal varices and a large polyp in the colon, concerning for malignancy which was believed to be the source of bleeding.
On biopsy, this lesion was found to be an adenoma with high grade dysplasia.
Gastroenterology believed that it would be possible to perform a transluminal resection but that the procedure would have high risk of perforation and death.
After a goals of care discussion with the [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 15155**], and the gastroenterology team it was decided that though the adenoma is high risk for malignancy, she will likely succumb to her severe pulmonary disease in the next 1-5 years and removal of the mass is not in line with her goals of care.
She was started on nadolol for esophageal varaces.
Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient presented on 5L trans-trach from a baseline of 4L at home in the setting of known IPF, COPD, and chronic heart failure.
Her dyspnea was attributed to anemia vs fluid overload from CHF, and remained stable in-house and gradually improved upon discharge from the ICU.
There was low suspicion for a COPD or IPF exacerbation.
Related to her shortness of breath, she occassionally coughed up "blood balls", which she attributed to bloodly mucous originating at her catheter site.
These were inconsistent, and associated with epistaxis, and we believed that there was a component of bloody post-nasal drip contributing, exacerbated by the fact that she was on a heparin gtt for her heart valve.
The total blood loss from these episodes was essentially non-contributory.
She was found to have evidence of a RUL HAP, so she was started empirically on vancomycin and cefepime.
She developed progressive respiratory distress and returned the MICU where she was intubated.
She was extubated and returned to the medical floor with o2 sats 95% on 2LNC The thought is that her respiratory distress was likely due to a mucus plug and pulmonary edema.
After two days on the medical floor, she pulled out a nasogastric tube which had been used for tubefeeds, aspirated and developed respiratory distress with hypoxia and acidemia.
Due to increasing wbc and decreased stool output there was also concern for c.diff, which ultimately was positive, and the pt was started on flagyl/PO vanc.
#Clostridium Difficile: The pt was found to have a rising WBC, episodes of hypotension and decreased stool output.
#Anticoagulation: Patient anticoagulated due to presence of mechanical valve.
She experienced epistaxis and coughed up bloody mucus in the setting of a slightly supratherapeutic PTT which resolved with decreasing her Heparin gtt.
Peak   Cr 2.8 from a baseline of ~1.4, likely secondary to hypovolemia as well as renal hypoperfusion [**2-27**] anemia.
Urine lytes showed were consistent with hypovolemia.
# Esophageal Varices.
# Hypertension.
# Pulmonary fibrosis.
# Hypernatremia.
Na at time of discharge 152 OUTPATIENT -- Continue monitoring of electrolytes; encourage PO intake and adminster D5W if needed (however by cautious in setting of known diastolic CHF).
The decision was made to forgo aggressive management of the colonic adenoma as her life expectancy with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (which she has suffered with for ~8 years) is now less than 5 years and likely less than one.
The family wanted the patient to remain full code and to have aggressive management of her pulmonary disease.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== Health Care Associated Pneumonia treatment -- Continue on meropenem for planned 8d course, end date [**11-3**] .
C. Difficile infection -- Continue on flagyl and PO vanc for planned 10d course; end date: [**11-9**] .
Congestive Heart Failure -- Continue PO Bumex 5mg daily; monitor weights as well as renal function with weekly chem 10 panel .
Colonic Polyp; GI bleed -- Please check twice weekly hematocrit check with plan to transfuse if <24 .
Arrythmia -- Restarting home dofetilide on discharge; primary cardiologist aware.
Hypernatremia -- Patient with improved PO intake in days leading up to discharge however sodiums borderine in 140s-150s.
Left kidney mass was seen on CT abdomen which is new since [**2134**] and will need follow up ultrasound and monitoring.
Outpatient Lab Work Please obtain twice weekly chemistry panels (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarb, BUN, creatinine, mag, calcium, phosp) to monitor for hypernatremia and chronic kidney insufficiency 3. bumetanide 1 mg Tablet Sig: Five (5) Tablet PO once a day.
15. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2)  Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
19. morphine 10 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: [**1-28**]  PO every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: GI bleed secondary to colonic lesion Health care associated pneumonia Acute on chronic kidney insufficiency COPD   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of GI bleed and while in house you developed respiratory compromise requiring intubation.
During the procedure a colonic lesion was seen and a plan was devised to proceed for excisional biopsy.
The cause of the distress included aspiration and possible pneumonia.
Also you were noted to have an infection in your GI tract and were started on antiobiotics to eradicate this bacteria.
