Admission Date:  [**2126-4-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2126-5-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2044-10-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3043**] Chief Complaint: Hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy CT guided lung biopsy Embolization of right bronchial artery Centran Venous Line Placement Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation  History of Present Illness: 81 year old man with GERD, HTN, who presented on [**4-30**] with hemoptysis.
The pt reported that at 7pm on [**4-29**] he had sudden onset hemoptysis - bright red blood with some clots which he estimated at 2 tbsp.
The pt denied any prior episodes of hemoptysis, epistaxis or GIB.
Nasogastric lavage showed scant red blood thought likely due to swallowing coughed up blood.
Since the pt's hemoptysis began to slow, and he did not develop hypoxia or an O2 requirement, the pt was admitted to the floor at 2am [**4-30**].
Initially on the floor the patient appeared comfortable, denied CP, shortness of breath and reported no hemoptysis for [**4-4**] hours.
At approximately 7am the pt developed hemoptysis again, and produced 100+cc of bright red blood over the course of the hour.
Bronchoscopy showed a large clot in the right bronchus intermedius, but no active bleeding was visualized.
A dual-lumen ET tube was placed to occlude blood from R lung from entering L lung, and the patient was transferred to the TSICU for further monitoring.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations, lightheadedness.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

Right bundle-branch block.
Modest inferior lead ST-T wave changes may be primary and are non-specific but baseline artifact makes assessment difficult.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Portable CXR [**2126-4-29**]: SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: The heart size is upper limits of normal, with a possible left ventricular configuration, which can be seen with hypertension.
The right upper lobe demonstrates a spiculated mass measuring approximately 4 cm.
A small amount of air projecting in the left paraspinal region through the medial lung base may represent a small hiatal hernia.
IMPRESSION: Right upper lobe mass and right hilar lymphadenopathy, for which CT is recommended for further evaluation.
Bronchial washings [**2126-4-30**]: (From RUL) Atypical epithelial cells, favor reactive bronchial cells.
Bronchial brushings [**2126-4-30**]: (From RUL) NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Reactive bronchial cells and pulmonary macrophages.
Right bundle-branch block.
Since the previous tracing of [**2126-4-29**] sinus tachycardia is absent, further precordial lead ST-T wave changes are seen and the QTc interval appears longer.
Moderate hiatal hernia.
Right upper lobe mass and lymphadenopathy.
An area of hypervascular blush was noted in the right upper lobe which is suspicious for neoplasm.
Multiple attempts were made to selectively cannulate the right bronchial artery but were unsuccessful because of a very acute angle of takeoff from the intercostal artery; no spinal artery was visualized.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**2126-5-2**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of hematoma in the abdomen or pelvis; bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis.
Bibasilar atelectasis persists, more prominent on the left.
Spiculated right upper lobe mass and hilar adenopathy are stable.
CT HEAD W/WOUT CONTRAST [**2126-5-8**] - FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intracranial, bony, or soft tissue masses.
Specifically, there is no evidence of enhancing parenchymal lesions.
No hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or infarction is identified.
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear and well aerated.
No fractures, suspicious lytic, sclerotic, or soft tissue abnormalities are identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of metastases.
Brief Hospital Course: 81M with history of minimal past medical history presenting with hemoptysis, found to have a spiculated mass in right upper lobe on bronchoscopy.
His hospital course in the SICU was complicated by an episode of submassive hemoptysis.
His hematocrit remained stable throught the remainder of his hospital course with no further evidence of hemoptysis.
# RUL mass: A broad differential was maintained although the suspicion for malignancy was high.
Bronchial washings were obtained during the initial bronchscopy with intiail pathology demonstrating reactive bronchial cells.
However no biopsy was able to be obtained secondary to poor visualization.
He underwent CT Head for staging as MRI was unable to be obtained secondary to hardware, which was negative for evidence of metastasis.
Right Upper Lobe Lung Mass .
Hypertension 2.
Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with hemoptysis (coughing up blood) and were found to have a mass in your lung that was the source of bleeding.
Your bleeding was treated with an interventional radiology procedure called coiling to stop the bleeding from one of the blood vessels in your lung.
You will follow up in clinic with Thoracic Surgery and your primary care physician for further evaluation and management of the mass in your lung.
