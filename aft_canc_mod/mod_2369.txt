The patient apparently drove to [**Hospital1 1562**] himself and presented to the ED where he complained of shortness of breath.
He then was noted to have a tonic-clonic seizure.
During this procedure patient found to have left lower lobe obstructing, friable mass.
Bronchoscopy here revealed similar tumor in left lower bronchus.

The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Moderate cardiomegaly, no signs of overt pulmonary edema.
The presence of small-to-moderate pleural effusions cannot be excluded.
[**Name (NI) **] sono - [**Name2 (NI) **] evidence of DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 year old male w/ severe COPD, seizure disorder?, CAD, presenting with respiratory distress and with unresponsive spell then found to have new left lower carina mass.
1) Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient was initially intubated for airway protection in the setting of apnea due to a likely neurological event.
Given patient had a fever early in the day was initially treated for presumed pneumonia with cefepime/vancomycin and given bronchodilators for COPD.
He also required a signficant amount of IVF on the night of admission due to hypotension so then developed an exacerbation of his chronic systolic CHF.
Following some respiratory distress on the night of [**9-4**] he was restarted on oral prednisone with plan for a five day burst.
Pt was breathing with minimal laboring, on exam had crackles and wheezing, crackles resolved after lasix challenge.
Pt's respiratory status was combination of obstruction by mass, post-obstructive PNA, COPD exacerbation with slight element of CHF.
2) Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient known to have depressed EF but received multiple fluid boluses on night of presentation in the setting of hypotension.
He then developed chest radiograph findings consistent with volume overload and presumed exacerbation of his chronic systolic CHF.
Echo showed improved EF from previous reports (EF of 45%) with no obvious wall motion abnormalities.
Pt was hypervolemic on exam with rales and lower ext edema, given lasix daily (from 80mg IV to 160mg PO) with net negative output of 1L/day.
3) Post-obstructive Pneumonia: The patient had a CT scan of his chest on [**2122-8-29**] at presentation to the outside hospital which revealed no infiltrate.
On the day of transfer, however, he had a fever and given no other likely source and abnormal chest radiograph he was started on cefepime/ vancomycin for possible health care associated pneumonia.
Given initially negative BAL results without gram positive organisms and then just with streptococcus pneumonia he was narrowed to simply levofloxacin on [**9-4**].
On [**9-5**], however, due to concern for a worsening appearance to his lower extremity and cellulitis his vancomycin was restarted and then cultures revealed MRSA growing on a BAL specimen from the lung as well as strep pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza.
4) Intrabronchial Mass: Patient was found to have a very vascular appearing mass on a bronchoscopy on day of transfer in his left lower lobe.
On the day following transfer [**2122-9-1**] he had resection of the mass with a rigid bronchoscope and imaging revealed a chondroid hamartoma.
#) Acute renal insufficiency - Cr rose up to 1.5 from baseline 0.8-1.
Likely pre-renal from poor forward flow due to third spacing vs hypovolemia.
No evidence of intrinsic or post-renal etiology.
5) Unresponsiveness/ Seizure: Patient has a history of nonresponsive spells status post extensive work up.
EEG at the OSH showed no epileptiform focus but overall presentation consistent with underlying seizure disorder.
8) CAD s/p CABG: The patient had an elevated troponin at presentation but signs/ symptoms not consistent with ACS and likely due to element of heart failure.
6. hydrocortisone 2.5 % Cream Sig: One (1) Appl Rectal [**Hospital1 **] PRN () as needed for lower extrem rash.
9. ipratropium bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) treatment Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Chondroid hamartoma in lung COPD exacerbation CHF exacerbation Post-obstructive pneumonia .
Secondary: seizure disorder CAD s/p CABG   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with respiratory distress, you were found to have a mass in your left lung which was a benign tumor called a chondroid hamartoma.
Because this mass was obstructing a part of the lung, you developed a small infection behind the obstruction which was treated with antibiotics.
You have underlying COPD and heart failure, both of which were controlled with steroids, inhalers, nebulizers, and water pills.
Your kidney function worsened a little bit, which is likely due to poor intake causing dehydration and extra fluid in your body from heart failure.
Because there was concern that your unresponsive episode was due to a seizure, you were started on an anti-seizure medication called Phenytoin.
We have made the following changes to your medications: Continue levoquin 750mg once a day until [**9-11**] Continue prednisone 40mg once a day until [**9-9**] Take Dilantin 200mg every 8 hrs to prevent seizures, have your levels checked daily at rehab Continue your home dose of lasix at 30mg twice a day Take miralax daily to help prevent constipation .
