Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified on [**2158-5-25**] at 10:20 a.m.  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 86804**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with CAD s/p CABG with bioprosthetic AVR [**58**] years prior and recent NSTEMI as well as HTN, GERD, prostate CA and h/o GIB admitted with MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscess with cord compression.
Epidural abscess s/p laminectomy: He was admitted on [**2158-5-17**] and underwent emergent 1.
He also underwent TEE on [**5-18**] which showed no vegetations.
His pain was controlled with standing tylenol and oral oxycodone, with occasional supplementation with IV morphine.
Delirium: He had delirium post-operatively that gradually improved with pain control and reorientation.
He was given olanzapine twice daily as needed for agitation.
Nutrition: He had marked aspiration during his admission and had a speech and swallow evaluation which he failed.
He ultimately had a PEG tube placed on [**5-24**] without complication.
Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: He has a history of mild systolic CHF.
CAD s/p NSTEMI: He had an NSTEMI in [**2-19**] and was started on Plavix at that time.
Anemia: He was moderately anemic perioperatively but his hematocrit remained stable.
He has had a recent GI bleed but there was no evidence of GI bleeding during this admission.
Acute renal failure: His creatinine increased post-operatively with a maximum of 2.9 on [**5-21**].
It was felt that this was most likely prerenal azotemia in the perioperative setting.
Prostate cancer: He was given a lupron injection in the SICU as he was due for prostate cancer treatment/suppression.
