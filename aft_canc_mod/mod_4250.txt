No evidence for obstruction.
Abnormality in the right lower pole as described above is likely a sequela from prior percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement.
There is no evidence for a renal abscess.
4-mm stone in the distal ureter.
2.1 cm mass in the endometrial cavity.
This may represent a submucosal fibroid; however, differential diagnosis includes endometrial polyp or carcinoma.
Findings consistent with hematocolpos.
Brief Hospital Course: Briefly, 45year old female who is otherwise healthy was found to have obstructing kidney stone in [**9-12**], which was then complicated by UTI and hydro requiring cystoscopy with stent placement [**9-26**], found pus, developed florid urosepsis (wbc 40, bandemia), UCx Ecoli, Rx Iv Abx in ICU then d/c'd [**10-4**] with bactrim, completed course.
Saw GU on [**10-7**], found to have urinary retention, foley placed, fell out at some point.
Seen again at OSH ER [**10-11**] with new fever/abd pain, had urinary retention, mildly dirty UA, got IV levaquin X3days, then d/c [**10-14**] on bactrim and foley.
Then on [**10-15**], had pain and LE cramps, called PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] neg, went to ER because of low fevers, but d/c home.
that night, [**10-15**] developed fever 103.8, back to ER, hypotensive, mildly dirty UA, got vanc/rocephin, transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for urosepsis, got 2L OSH, 2L here, and levophed started in ER and RIJ placed and t/f to ICU.
last temp 101.4 on [**10-17**] am, afebrile since.
CT nothing acute, stent in place, no perinephric abcess, etc.
On transfer to floor, low grade temps, afebrile by next day.
Given her improvement with meropeneum and presumed failure with bactrim and allergy to fluroquinolones and PCN, decision made to complete 14days with ertapenum (day [**4-13**] on discharge).
He will refer her to a PCP since her medical problems are a bit more complex than previous.
She also has had recent issues with urinary retention, likely complication of her illness and narcotics.
She is told not to have any decath trials until her stone/stent issue has resolved given high risk for repeat infeciton in case of retention.
45year old female with complicated recent urological history with obstsructing stone s/p stent [**9-26**] complicated by urosepsis, then urinary retention and recurrent [**Hospital **] transfered from OSH with fevers/hypotension, presumed urosepsis.
Sepsis, presumed urosepsis: UA mildly dirty (had been on bactrim) but has stent in place and stone which may be nidus, all in setting of urinary retention and foley.
Fever: as above, presumed urinary source.
Possible related to bactrim but wouldnt have expected sepsis picture with drug fever.
Likely has acute illness/ACD component.
No obvious bleeding or hemolysis.
