- [**Known lastname 515**] or RUQ tenderness.
Ext:  2+ bilateral pedal edema to knees.
Biliary Sepsis:  CT belly showed mulitple liver mets, slight obstruction of biliary stent and multiple mets at porta hepatis, peritoneal carcinamatosis and duodenal compression.
Pt was treated with IV levofloxacin, until [**8-3**], when he was switched to IV Zosyn, for fear of possible ongoing infection (increasing Cr 1.7 and increased LDH to the 400's).
ARF:  Likely pre-renal [**1-31**] decreased effective arterial volume in the face of sepsis.
Stable and could be the source of his high LDH.
Repeat CT of the belly [**9-3**] revealed pneumobilia, "stable" peritoneal carcinamotosis (unchanged from previous study), no evidence of biliary or bowel obstruction.
Pt's cough may be related to pulmonary metastatic disease, and his liver mets are likely contributing to his elevated LFT's.
