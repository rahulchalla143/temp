CT head showed increased size of her left occipital mass with significant vasogenic edema.
Prior to [**2188-7-9**], her family reports that she had trouble seeing things in her right visual field but had no other neurological symptoms.
There has been no clinical activity concerning for seizure.
- MRI [**5-/2188**] head revealed new brain lesions after new neurological symptoms of headaches, visual deficit of the right field, and right lower extremity weakness.
[**2188-2-24**] - CT of the chest for refractory cough reveals a large right upper lobe mass extending into the chest wall with probable/possible chest wall invasion, with mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
[**2188-3-10**] - Bronchoscopy - Transbronchial biopsy of the mass, 4L,  4R and 11R nodes, and bronchial wash positive for non-small cell  lung cancer (adenocarcinoma) [**2188-3-17**] - PET/CT - FDG avid right upper lobe mass with surrouding  ground-glass opacities suggestive of lymphangitic spread and FDG  avid extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy, but no other FDG avid lesions at other sites.
MRI head - Concern of a single 4 mm left occipital mass, questionable metastases.

Right hemianopsia Motor: Full strength throughout  Pertinent Results: CT head [**2188-7-9**]: Increased size of the metastatic lesion within the left occipital lobe with increasing surrounding vasogenic edema.
New mild hydrocephalus of unclear etiology.
There is no evidence of new hemorrhage, mass effect, or infarction.
Stable mass effect on the left lateral ventricle with persistent  ventriculomegaly, unchanged from the prior exam performed 10 hours earlier, but increased from the prior MRI in [**2188-5-13**].
Increase in size of left occipital lobe lesion with increased mass effect on the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle, similar degree of subependymal spread along the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle and mild adjacent mass effect and rightward deviation of the posterior falx.
Second lesion just adjacent to the vermis within the left occiput and right frontal lesion have decreased in size compared to the prior examination.
Status post left occipital craniotomy, expected post-surgical changes are seen, consistent with edema in the surgical bed and residual blood products.
There is persistent residual mass effect in the left ventricular trigone and associated vasogenic edema.
The area with enhancement in the left occipital lobe has been removed, the possibility of residual mass cannot be completely excluded, followup is advised.
Ventricular shunt is in place, terminating at the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**] via right frontal burr hole with no evidence of hydrocephalus.
The right frontal approach intraventricular catheter terminates in the region of the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**].
S/p left occipital mass resection.
Brief Hospital Course: 53 yo RH woman with stage IV NSCLC with brain mets s/p steroid therapy and whole-brain radiation completed on [**2188-6-18**] presenting with sudden-onset N/V and lethargy, found to have increased size of left occipital mass with significant vasogenic edema .
# OCCIPITAL MASS: Patient was admitted to medicine on after CT head showed large left occipital mass.
The operation was without complications.
On HD#4 (POD #1), she was AAOx3 with fluid speech and intact repetition/comprehension, but reported NEW right hemianopia likely secondary to mass resection.
Dressings were removed, wound C/D/I.
Follow-up CT showed good shunt placement and small intraventricular hemorrhage.
# GOALS OF CARE: Patient's family initially requested palliative care consult, and plan was for CMO until her neurologic status improved on HD#3 and patient requested surgery.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
