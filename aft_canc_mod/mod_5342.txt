The patient likely had thrombocytopenia from ITP due to Hodgkin's lymphoma with then a component of suppression from chemotherapy.

Hypertension: The patient became hypertensive to SBP 160s, likely related to steroid therapy.
Abdominal pain: The patient complained of right upper quadrant pain during admission.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed no liver/gallbladder abnormality.
