History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 6944**] is a 46 year old woman with a history of prior rectal adenocarcinoma s/p [**Month (only) **] in [**2138**] as well as ampullary adenocarcinoma in association with a type 1 choledochal cyst s/p Whipple in [**2139**] who reported being in her usual, fairly good state of health until approximately [**Month (only) 958**] of this year at which time she noted the onset of nagging abdominal pain in her lower quadrants bilaterally.
The patient reported that she lost ~5lbs as she developed early satiety initially and later noted that she proceeded to both gain back the weight as well as experience progressive abdominal distention.
She was in touch with her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] and onc physicians regarding her symptoms and underwent an EGD to further evaluate these symptoms.
During this same time ([**6-/2146**]), Ms. [**Known lastname 6944**] additionally underwent a CT and PET scan at an OSH which were notable for an area in the superior portion of the abdomen which was concerning for malignancy.
That imaging showed mild ascites with what appears to be a patent portal vein.
She then underwent percutaneous sampling of the concerning lesion which reportedly revealed adenocarcinoma.
Past Medical History: rectal adenocarcinoma s/p [**Month (only) **] with colostomy in [**2138**] adenocarcinoma at the ampulla of Vater in association with a type 1 choledochal  s/p hepaticojejunostomy, CCY in [**2139**] GERD perineal wound drainage procedures depression  Social History: Ms. [**Known lastname 6944**] [**Last Name (Titles) 22381**] worked as a substitute school teacher.

Sequela of portal venous hypertension are therefore likely related to this portal vein near-occlusion.
Intermediate density ascites consistent with sanguinous ascites observed at surgery, though without evidence of acute hemoperitoneum.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 6944**] was admitted to the HPB Surgical Service for an exploratory laparotomy on [**2146-10-4**] following several months of vague abdominal pain and distention as well as radiographic and biopsy proven evidence of abdominal malignancy.
On [**2146-10-4**], the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, with was complicated by the presence of at least 2 L of bloody ascites which limited the scope and extent of the procedure.
A sample of this fluid was obtained for cytology, which was later found to be negative for malignant cells.
Ms. [**Known lastname 6944**] was safely extubated following the procedure but experienced laryngospasm which required protective reintubation and admission to the ICU overnight on POD#0(reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
The patient was safely extubated on the morning of POD#1 without difficulties.
Neuro: The patient's pain was initially treated with a fentanyl epidural with good effect and adequate pain control.
Of note, however, she did receive 1 1L bolus on POD#0 for low urine output, and she responded appropriately to this treatment.
Pulmonary: The patient experienced an episode of laryngospasm following intial extubation post-operatively on [**2146-10-4**] which required immediate protective reintubation on POD#0.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
On POD#2 the patient's wound was noted to be expressing a significant amount of bloody ascites which was initially controlled with an appliance.
Given the large amount of continued treatment, the wound was re-inforced with suture and a hepatology consult was obtained to assess for liver disease.
On their recommendations a CT abdomen/pelvis was performed which noted a patent portal venous system and hepatic dilitation consistent with recurrence of malignancy.
On the hepatology team's further recommendation, the patient was started on aldactone, spironolactone, and a low-sodium diet in an attempt to reduce production of ascites fluid.
Ms. [**Known lastname 6944**] continued to produce varying amounts of ascites drainage from the wound throughout her hospital course.
By the time of discharge, the wound was healing well, with scant stapline line erythema but with no warmth, evidence of purulent drainage, or tenderness on palpation.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely monitored.
The patient was noted to have low-grade fevers on POD#5, but remained asymptomatic otherwise and, as she self-defervesced, required no further work-up at that time.
Ms. [**Known lastname 6944**] was noted to have low grade fevers on POD#7 in addition to some erythema around the inferior portion of the wound.
This was subsequently discontinued on POD#8 given a significant improvement in the appearance of the pt's wound as well as a normalization of Ms. [**Known lastname 6945**] fevers.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
