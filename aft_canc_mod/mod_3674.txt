He was started empirically on Flagyl and Levoquin for cholangitis and he was subsequently transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
After his transfer, he was afebrile and his blood pressure remained stable with a systolic blood pressure on the low 100s.
An ERCP was performed which revealed a previously placed biliary metal stent whic was blocked with debris and sludge.
He was transferred to the floor on [**2178-7-10**] and he continued to remain afebrile and normotensive.
2) Pancreatic Mass- No tissue diagnosis has been obtained at this point.
He has been seen by surgeon Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] who deemed the mass unresectable on the basis of CT findings of a pancreatic head mass causing near complete encasement and narrowing of the superior mesenteric vein and abutting both the portal venous confluence, as well as the duodenum.
3) Atrial Fibrillation-  Mr. [**Known lastname 69523**] has intermittent atrial fibrillation during this hospitalization.
His metoprolol was initially witheld due to hypotension but was restarted upon transfer to the floor.
He did have episodes tachycardia to 120s prior to starting metoprolol.
Also, given his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation during this admission and his presumed hypercoagulability due to pancreatic cancer, Mr. [**Known lastname 69523**] was started on Lovenox to be continued after discharge.
4) Hyperglycemia -  Fingersticks have ranged during his admission between 122-211.
[**Month (only) 116**] be due to pancreatic mass.
5) s/p Fall- This fall was thought to be due to weakness in the setting of his sepsis.
