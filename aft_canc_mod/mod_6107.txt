Admission Date:  [**2139-7-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2139-7-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-5-2**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8790**] Chief Complaint: Hematuria, flank pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 64yF with history of left renal cell carcinoma presenting with left flank pain and substernal chest pain.
She was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma in [**5-/2139**] and started on Sutent 5 days ago.
After her first dose of Sutent, she noticed hematuria that started after the dose and improved throughout the subsequent day (until her next dose).
After 3 doses, she had occasional blood clots and even had difficulty urinating secondary to the clots.
On the day of admission, she developed abdominal/flank pain that was [**11-15**] in quality and constant in nature.
At the same time, she developed substernal chest pressure, non-radiating, associated with nausea and one episode of vomiting, but no shortness of breath or diaphoresis.
In the ED, she received 1 liter normal saline, 4mg IV morphine x 2, and zofran 4mg x 1, with resolution of her symptoms.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - [**2138**]: Began noticing a "bulge" in her left flank which slowly grew in size and discomfort.
- [**2139-5-14**]: CT abdomen/pelvis showed a very large left renal mass about 16 cm in largest diameter with question of invasion of the left renal vein.
The lung bases showed multiple pulmonary nodules, the largest of which was 15 mm in diameter, concerning for pulmonary metastases.
There were also  scattered subcentimeter nodules in the remainder of both lungs.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension [**5-14**] Successful Aflutter Ablation Atrial Fibrillation Asthma Chronic low back pain Arthritis Hysterectomy Tonsillectomy Anxiety   Social History: She is originally from [**Country 5881**].
Family History: Her father died of cardiovascular disease.
She denies any known malignancies in a first or second-degree relative.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T98.9F, BP 182/40, HR 64, RR 20, Sat 94%RA General: Appears older than stated age, no acute distress HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, MMM, OP clear Heart: RRR, normal S1/S2, 1-2/6 systolic murmur at LUSB Lungs: CTA bilaterally Abdomen: Soft, non-distended.
Point of maximal tenderness over large palpable mass in LUQ.
**FINAL REPORT [**2139-7-10**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2139-7-10**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
A pulmonary nodule also within the right lower lobe (2:2) measures 1.4 cm, previously measured 1.0 cm.
There is no pleural effusion.
Redemonstrated is a large mass arising from the mid to upper pole of the left kidney, which measures grossly 17 cm x 11 cm x 13 cm, which is not significantly changed from prior study.
The mass is heterogeneous in attenuation, with areas of low attenuation, likely reflective of necrosis.
Also scattered within the mass are linear and rounded hyperdense foci, which on a chest CT, from [**2139-5-29**], appears similar, and may reflect areas of calcification.
There is invasion and extension into the left renal vein, similar to prior study.
Additionally, there is moderate hydronephrosis of the left kidney, which demonstrates delayed excretion of contrast.
Within the collecting system are areas of heterogeneous attenuation, which is concerning for tumor invasion.
There is gallbladder wall edema, which is minimally distended.
There is also mild intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.
There is no free air or free fluid.
Scattered mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are not enlarged by CT size criteria.
No retroperitoneal hematoma or hemoperitoneum is seen.
There is no pelvic free fluid or adenopathy.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
Large left renal mass, not significantly changed in size compared to prior MRI, with evidence of left renal vein invasion.
Moderate left hydronephrosis with likely tumor invasion into the collecting system.
Mildly distended gallbladder, with gallbladder wall edema, and mild prominence of the intrahepatic ducts.
Correlation with LFTS and right upper quadrant symptoms is suggested.
[**2139-7-9**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
[**2139-7-13**] BARIUM SWALLOW  IMPRESSION: Moderate esophageal dysmotility, with no evidence of  diverticulum, webs or strictures.
A barium tablet passes freely through the esophagus without any delay.
[**2139-7-14**]  CXR IMPRESSION: Clear improvement of temporary pulmonary congestion pattern [**2139-7-8**], consistent with fluid overload and temporary left-sided congestion.
Brief Hospital Course: 64yoF with newly diagnosed L renal cell carcinoma, just started on Sutent, who was admitted with hematuria/urinary retention, LUQ abdominal pain, and through admission found to be febrile with AFib and RVR likely due to UTI.
Hematuria: Thought to be either from newly started Sutent (~30% incidence) vs known tumor invasion into collecting system on CT vs worsening of renal cell carcinoma (of note, pt also with tumor invasion into L renal vein).
Sutent was held initially but restarted by discharge and she was dischaged on Sutent, and not having any hematuria by discharge.
Of note, her Coumadin which was a home med given AFib/Flutter issues, was held through admission and CONTINUES to be held, in the setting of hematuria and potential for bleeding into renal mass.
Admission to MICU for fevers, AFib with RVR, UTI: On day 2, pt was noted to have fevers to 102 with subsequent AFib with RVR.
She remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred to MICU for closer monitoring where she was found to have a pansensitive Ecoli UTI and treated broadly at first, then narrowed to IV Zosyn which she completed a full course for.
She was called out of MICU in stable condition and had no further unstable events, although she did have occasional RVR which was treated with nodal agents as below.
Admitted in sinus, however pt noted to have AFib with RVR and short bursts of atrial tachycardia/non sustained supraventricular tachycardias.
In the ICU she was continued on her home Verapamil course but was noted to have some pauses which required down titration of her home dosage.
LUQ abd pain: Likely due to very large renal mass, LFT's and lipase were normal.
No hemorrhage seen on CT.
Pain was controlled with MS Contin, which she was discharged on, with short acting Morphine for breakthrough.
Likely due to LUQ renal mass.
Hypoxia: During her trigger on day 2 for which she went to MICU, she was noted to have hypoxia to the high 80's.
She had an echo with a normal EF >55%, mild MR, and mild pulmHTN.
She also became slightly volume overloaded by physical exam and CXR showing mild volume overload and small bilateral pleural effusions and so was gently diuresed with good improvement in her O2 sats to 95-96% RA and also clearing of her CXR.
Xanax 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO three times a day as needed for anxiety.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Disp:*20 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Left renal cell carcinoma Hematuria Urinary retention Afib with RVR Urinary tract infection Chest pain of unlikely cardiac origin   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to BIDMD with hematuria, urinary retention, and abdominal pain, all likely from your large renal cell carcinoma.
You spent some time in the intensive care unit due to your fevers causing a rapid heart rate.
You were treated for a urinary tract infection and your fevers and heart rate resolved.
You continue to have some blood in your urine.
You continue to have blood in your urine and this increases your tendency to bleed.
We started you on MS Contin for long acting pain control.
You may also take immediate release morphine for breakthrough pain.
Take regular stool softners as you are likely to get constipated from you pain medications.
