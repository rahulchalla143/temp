[**2204-5-7**] EGD: - Varices at the lower third of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction Erythema, congestion, abnormal vascularity and mosaic appearance in the stomach compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy - Polyp in the proximal body (injection) - Beyond pylorus, 8 mm non bleeding polyp adjacent to hepatico-jejunostomy.

LGIB:  Initial immediate concern was for UGIB, particularly variceal bleeding or portal gastropathy in this patient with decompensated liver disease.
Differential also included gastritis and LGI sources, including hemorrhoids, diverticulosis, AVM.
EGD was performed upon arrival to the ICU which showed non-bleeding esphageal and gastric varices as well as an oozing gastric polyp which was injected with epinephrine- nothing to suggest the cause of patients relatively [**Name2 (NI) 19912**] decrease in hematocrit.
The patient underwent capsule endoscopy on HD2 which showed several small ulcers in the small bowel.
Hepatitis C cirrhosis s/p liver [**Name2 (NI) **]:  Tbili slightly elevated from baseline although AST, ALT, alk phos improved from baseline.
Trazodone 100 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for Insomnia.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Lower Gastrointestinal Bleed Acute Blood Loss Anemia  Compenstated end-stage liver disease Chronic Pancreatitis   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable with brown stools, ambulating the unit independently.
The bleeding has stopped and you required 3 blood transfusions during your stay.
You underwent an endoscopy and a colonoscopy that did not show a clear source for your bleeding so a capsule study was performed prior to your discharge which you will need follow up for as an outpatient.
Please call the liver clinic if you develop any further signs of bleeding in your stool, feel lightheaded, have chest pain, or any other new concerns.
