History of Present Illness: History of Present Illness: 64-year-old man with pancreatic cancer s/p recent Whipple ([**2159-1-31**]) now on adjuvant chemotherapy (last dose per patient was two weeks prior to this), diabetes type II, sCHF with EF 30%, CAD s/p MI, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin who presented to the ED from home with progressive lower extremity swelling and "not feeling well."
Of note, patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital3 3583**] to home with diagnosis of pneumonia.
Labs notable for hct 29 (at baseline), trop of 0.21 with normal CK (in setting of acute on chronic renal failure with creatinine 2.0 from baseline ~1.3), and glucose of 38.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation (rate of 107) with RBBB and RAD.
There were no significant changes from a preoperative EKG in [**Month (only) 958**].
CXR showed RLL infiltrate consistent with pneumonia.
He was given 1.5L NS (given h/o sCHF) and admitted to the intensive care unit for persistant hypotension.

There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls and apex and hypokinesis of the basal and mid anterior, anterolateral, and inferoseptal segments.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.

IMPRESSION: Severely depressed left ventricular systolic function with akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls and apex and hypokinesis of the basal and mid anterior, anterolateral, and inferoseptal segments.
Mild aortic root and ascending aortic diliatation.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.

The severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation has increased.
ECG [**2159-5-2**]: Atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of 107.
Complete right bundle-branch block with QRS duration of 136 milliseconds.
Poor R wave progression laterally.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2159-2-6**] no diagnostic interval change.
There has been reaccumulation of bilateral pleural effusions , more conspicuous in the current exam could be due to difference in positioning of the patient.
Bibasilar consolidations are grossly unchanged.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 64-year-old man with history of pancreatic cancer s/p Whipple on chemotherapy, DM II, CAD, PVD, and sCHF now presents with hypotension, and progressive lower extremity edema.
# Hypotension: Likely secondary to decompensated heart failure with unclear trigger.
[**Month (only) 116**] also have been secondary to poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with RVR as patient had not been taking his digoxin.
# Acute on chronic sCHF: Likely secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy.
On admission, patient had 3+ lower extremity edema to the hip, and a BNP > [**Numeric Identifier 15362**].
He had improved, but persistent LE edema on discharge.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: likely prerenal azotemia - unclear if secondary to hypovolemia versus poor forward flow from decompensated CHF.
# Atrial fibrillation:  Loaded with digoxin and restarted metoprolol at 12.5mcg PO BID.
He remained in atrial fibrillation.
Afebrile while here with no new respiratory complaints.
# Pancreatic cancer s/p Whipple: patient is currently undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy and work-up for possible cyberknife therapy, both at outside centers closer to his home.
Spoke with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3443**] ([**Hospital3 **] Oncology), she will see him in clinic next week to further plan his cancer treatment.
Normal MCV suggests anemia of chronic inflammation.
# Type II diabetes: on insulin as outpatient.
His long-acting insulin was held given renal failure and low sugars in ED.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Simethicone 80 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for stomach pain.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Titrate down furosemide dose as lower extremity edema resolves, and patient approaches dry weight.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure Pancreatic Cancer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
