On [**2131-8-1**], the patient underwent robotic distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter, JP drain, dPCA for pain control, on amicar as specified by her consultant specialist, for history of functional platelet disorder.
On POD#1 ([**8-2**]): The patient continued to have good pain control with a dPCA.
In the evening of this day, it was determined upon discussion with her hematology specialist, that Amicar was no longer required.
On POD#2 ([**8-3**]): The patient was continued on a dPCA for pain control, and toradol was added to her regimen for 3 days, which she tolerated well.
On POD#3 ([**8-4**]): The patient continued to have good pain control on the specified regimen.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
