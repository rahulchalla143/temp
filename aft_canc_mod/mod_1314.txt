Past Medical History: PMH: Friedreich's ataxia Muscular dystrophy DM insulin dependent from age 31 atrial fibrillation/flutter hypothyroidism gastroparesis major depression urinary incontinence HTN systolic CHF with LVEF 40-45% Uterine fibroid CKD baseline Cr 1.2 s/p spinal fusion for scoliosis s/p CCY   Social History: married and lives at home.
No alcohol or IVDU.
mother died of lung cancer (was a smoker).
A&O x3 HEENT: NCAT, anicteric sclera, non-injected conjunctiva.

Fibroid uterus.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary, this is a 42 female with [**Last Name (un) 22989**] ataxia/Musc Dystrophy, cardiomyopathy with EF 20%, afib/flutter s/p DC cardioversion on coumadin with uterine fibroids and menorrhagia in setting of elevated INR who was transferred to the CCU for bradycardia and hypotension.
Bradycardia/afib: Patient has tachy-brady syndrome and had long pause in setting of digoxin/amiodarone/carvedilol use and hypokalemia.
However, she has had no recent change in medications.
Now appears to be in sinus rhytm/afib and has fluctuated as an outpatient despite cardioversion.
Hypotension: Likely related to acute bradycardia.
Admission hypotension likely related to blood loss.
Related to underlying muscular dystrophy.
No current signs of decompensation.
Digoxin and ACE were held in setting of bradycardia and hypotension.
Nothing to suggest abnormal uterine bleeding per GYN.
Patient was instructed to follow up with GYN as an outpatient for further management of her uterine fibroids.
Amiodarone causes decreased clearance of tizanadine and increases the sedative effects.
Diabetes Type I: Secondary to Friedreichs Ataxia.
