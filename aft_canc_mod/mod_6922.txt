HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 68-year-old woman with a past medical history of stage IV gastric cancer complicated by superior vena cava syndrome and small-bowel obstruction requiring colostomy as well as right internal jugular vein deep venous thrombosis, bilateral malignant pleural effusions, and hydronephrosis requiring bilateral stent placement who presented to [**Hospital3 1196**] with a chief complaint of fever.
The patient had been recently admitted to [**Hospital3 20445**] from [**1-13**] to [**1-23**] for superior vena cava syndrome, pleural effusions, and extrinsic ureteral compression, status post bilateral stent placement.
At that time, she received thrombolysis and had a superior vena cava stent placed.
During that hospitalization she had bilateral thoracenteses which revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma.
She had bilateral renal stents placed as well for the extrinsic compression.
Since that discharge she had been doing well without pain at home or any specific complaints.
She did note some bleeding from her ostomy bag being changed several days ago, but otherwise denies any complaints.
She also denies headache, neck stiffness, sinus tenderness, sore throat, rashes, cough, or change in her ostomy output, or melena.
Stage IV gastric cancer diagnosed in [**2118**] with metastases to her para-aortic and retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
Superior vena cava syndrome in [**2121-1-11**].
Small-bowel obstruction requiring colostomy.
Hydronephrosis in [**2120-12-12**] requiring bilateral stent placement.
Right internal jugular vein deep venous thrombosis, status post chemotherapy with Xeloda and Taxotere; stopped secondary to adverse effects; changed to naboline.
Bilateral malignant pleural effusions.
Mother and sister died of ovarian cancer, and mother also had gastric cancer.
In general, this was an awake and alert female in mild distress.
Dry mucous membranes.
First heart sound and second heart sound.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
Neurologically, cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact except for decreased hearing.
Skin revealed no lesions or rashes.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient with febrile neutropenia.
Required Levophed for pressure support.
Urinalysis as well as blood cultures at [**Hospital3 1196**] were reportedly positive for gram-negative rods.
Sensitivities returned for the gram-negative rods at the outside hospital, and the patient was found to have pan-sensitive Escherichia coli.
DIC panel was negative for DIC cause of elevated INR.
Coumadin was restarted later on in the course of the patient's hospitalization for management of her superior vena cava syndrome.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient initially with hypotension, on Levophed and vasopressin.
(b)  Pump:  The patient was given 10 liters of intravenous fluids in the Intensive Care Unit causing some fluid overload which was diuresed with Lasix over the course of the next week on the floor.
PULMONARY:  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was exacerbated by possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare given her significant wheezing.
Other possibilities included cardiac secondary to congestive heart failure.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  The patient with hypokalemia during hospitalization and repleted daily with potassium supplements as well as being discharged home on potassium supplementation.
DISCHARGE STATUS/DISPOSITION:  To home with [**Hospital6 1587**] for frequent INR checks until the patient has followup; also with a prednisone taper for a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
