Admission Date:  [**2169-6-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-7-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2128-6-29**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: N/V, confusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: L Craniotomy for Mass Resection C-Section via midline incision   History of Present Illness: HPI:  Pt is a 40 yo G1P3 female currently 29 weeks pregnant with PMHx sig for Hep B carrier who is transferred from [**Hospital3 38285**] for MRI subsequently found to have large 7 cm x 5 xm extra-axial lesion over left frontal convexity likely to be a meningioma.
The patient had persistent headache several weeks ago now resolved.
The husband has noticed word finding difficulty over the last week.
Over last three days she has had nausea and vomiting.
Past Medical History: Hep B carrier, 1 prior miscarriage at 12 weeks, 1 prior c-section due to fetal position.
Physical Exam: Physical Exam Upon Arrival:  Vitals: T 99.3; BP 88/54; P 89; RR 12; O2 sat 98%  General: lying in bed NAD HEENT: NCAT, moist mucous membranes Neck: supple Extremities: no c/c/e.
Mild right pronator drift.
Large extra-axial mass with vascular flow voids within in the left frontal region with extensive mass effect and surrounding edema is most likely a meningioma.
No obvious superior sagittal sinus invasion noted on the non-contrast MRV, though the mass is in close proximity.
No flow limiting stenosis or occlusion in the included intracranial arteries, apart from displacement of vessels described above due to mass effect.
Prominent proximal Basilar A. likely due to fenestration and infundibula.
Further evaluation of the intracranial arteries with CTA can be considered, when appropriate.
CT/CTA HEAD [**6-23**]: CT: large left frontal extraaxial mass with broad dural base and with associated edema and mass effect as characterized by mri [**2169-6-20**].
accounting for differences in modality, mass effect and edema appear unchnaged.
there is compression of left lateral ventricle and third ventricle and dilation of the right lateral vent occipital and temporal horns c/w trapping.
no evidence of hemorrhage.
CTA: COW and major intracranial branches are patent.
there is rightward displacement of the ACA's by the mass but they remain patent.
no aneurysms identified  CT HEAD [**6-24**]: IMPRESSION: Status post excision of large extra-axial mass in the left frontal lobe, with remaining extensive mass effect and surrounding edema, similar compared to prior.
Post-surgical changes seen at the surgical bed with pneumocephalus and small amount of blood products.
Status post resection of the previously noted left frontal extra-axial mass, with post-surgical changes and small amount of blood products in the surgical resection bed.
Persistent mass effect, with subfalcine herniation and shift of the midline structures to the right side by 1.4 cm and mass effect on the left lateral ventricle.
Assessment for any residual tumor is limited on the present study.
Consider followup to assess for residual tumor after resolution of the post-surgical changes.
No obvious evidence of infarction.
Presence of blood products limits assessment of decreased diffusion/infarction.
OB also obtaining daily fetal heart tones and biweekly BPP.
In the afternoon following her procedure, she developed acute mental status changes, and grew increasingly perseverative and had increased word finding difficulty.
A CT was performed which demonstrated an increase in the VG Edema, and ample blood supply to the mass.
Repeat NCCT head [**6-27**] showed increased vasogenic edema, but her Neurological status remained stable and he was able to ambulate independently with close monitoring by physical therapy.
On [**6-29**], she was noted to have significant expressive aphasia.
She was restarted on Mannitol 25gm q6h, and symptoms improved.
In the setting of her mental status change, she was transferred to the neurosurgery floor to be closer to the primary service base should she have further decline.
Disp:*qs Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Left Frontal Mass C-section   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital for a c-section and removal of a mass in your head.
You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.
o	An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.
Loss of vision, either partial or total.
Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.
Severe sensitivity to light.
Severe headache or change in headache.
Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
New onset of seizure or change in seizure, or seizure from which you wake up confused.
Due to the complexity of neurosurgical procedures and treatment of neurosurgical problems, effective advice regarding emergency situations cannot be given over the telephone.
Should you have a situation which is not life-threatening, but you feel needs addressing before normal office hours or on the weekend, please present to the local emergency room, where the physician there will evaluate you and contact us if needed.
