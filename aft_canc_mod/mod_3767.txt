No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severley hypokinetic anterior wall and septal wall.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %).
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.A filamentous echo density (freely mobile) was visualized in the LVOT.
3D analysis showed it to be attached to the interventricular septum.
It was not associated with with aortic valve regurgitation, stenosis or any other abnormality.
No change in ventricular global or focal LV systolic function 2.
The echo density visualized in the LVOT is no longer visualized.
No change in valve structure and function.
Lungs are essentially clear except for bibasilar opacities consistent with atelectasis.
No pneumothorax has been demonstrated.
