The patient was admitted [**Date range (1) 30498**]/12 following ERCP, performed due to biliary obstruction.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was initially difficult but was successful and deep after placement of a 5 mm x 5 FR pancreatic stent.
A 12 mm long segment of severe narrowing was noted at the level of the hilum consistent with a stricture.
ERCP was complicated by nausea, vomiting, and elevated lipase.
Hospital course was also notable for new diagnosis of bilateral DVTs for which patient was started on lovenox treatment.
Yesterday, the patient developed weakness, nausea, and vomiting.
He estimates that he had 10 episodes of non-bloody emesis.
He also had some black diarrhea overnight last night.
Then, at 3 a.m., the patient awoke with nausea and vomiting.
He spent the next couple of hours sitting on a couch, during which time he experienced shaking chills and also syncopized for a couple of minutes.
The patient also complains of cough and the sensation fo being unable to take a deep breath, which started during his recent admission.
CXR demonstrated new L basilar infiltrate and bilateral pleural effusion.
Patient remained hypotensive in SBP 80s, requiring initiation of levophed.
CT abd/pelvis demonstrated known tumor, mildly distended stomach, with some fluid in the lower esophagus, could relate to partial gastric antral obstruction in the presence of symptoms.
CT abd/pelvis also showed pleural effusion, ascites, improved left hydronephrosis.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient complained of heartburn and abdominal bloating.
Review of systems: No fever.
No chest pain.
+abdominal discomfort and bloating, increased from baseline.
Has urinary ostomy.
No focal weakness.
No visual changes.

[**2167-1-24**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - Slight prominence of the hila, could be due to vascular engorgement.
Bibasilar opacities could represent atelectasis, aspiration, or infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
[**2167-1-24**] CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CON - Moderate-sized right and a small left pleural effusion, with bibasilar compressive atelectasis.
Patchy opacities in the left lower lobe, concerning for acute infection/aspiration.
known infiltrating gallbladder fossa mass, allowing for differences in Technique is similar to the prior study.
Infiltration of the gastric antrum and ascending colon, with resultant gastric outlet obstruction.
Moderate-to-large volume ascites, consistent with worsening omental metastatic disease, which is suboptimally assessed in this non-contrast study.
Lack of air within the biliary stent and left lobe of liver suggests stent occlusion.
Interval improvement in the previously noted left hydroureteronephrosis in this patient status post urinary diversion and ileal conduit.
[**2167-1-24**] DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL POR AND LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US - Please note, patient had difficulty remaining in left lateral decubitus after obtaining only sagittal images, at which point the decision was made to transfer to the right lateral decubitus position.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, stones, or masses.
Patient is status post urinary diversion and ileal conduit.
No bladder assessment performed.
Brief Hospital Course: IMPRESSION: 75M with PMH significant for metastatic gallbladder carcinoma, bladder carcinoma (s/p primary resection with ileal conduit formation), hypertension and hyperlipidemia with recent hospitalization for ERCP in the setting of biliary stricture with metal stent deployment complicated by post-procedural pancreatitis and evidence of DVTs who now presents with nausea, emesis and hypotension concerning for septic shock requiring pressor support with evolving pneumonia, acute renal insufficiency and hyperbilirubinemia.
# ACUTE HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE - Following volume resuscitation needs given his septic shock, the patient developed worsening respiratory concerns and hypoxia with an increased oxygen requirement.
His CXR imaging demonstrated marked pleural effusions.
# SHOCK - Presented with hypotension and evidence of volume depletion with leukocytosis and bandemia in the setting of metastatic gallbladder carcinoma, with acute renal insufficiency and hyperbilirubinemia.
Possible sources of infection include: biliary obstruction or stent obstruction with gram negative or anaerobic enteric seeding vs. aspiration pneumonitis (CT imaging showed LLL opacification) or pneumonia vs. urinary tract infection.
Following aggressive volume resuscitation, his hypotension and tachycardia improved and his pressor support was weaned.
ACS surgery had been consulted given his evidence of delayed emptying and possible gastric obstruction with known biliary obstruction and felt no surgical intervention was feasible.
His imaging showed evidence of gastric antral obstruction.
# NAUSEA, EMESIS AND GASTRIC OUTLET OBSTRUCTION - CT imaging revealed tumor that extends to the gastric antrum and hepatic flexure with mildly distended stomach and some fluid in the lower esophagus; possibly related to partial gastric antral obstruction vs. delayed transit and slow emptying given his nausea and bilious emesis concerns.
Evidence of tumor causing obstruction without definable surgical options - would likely require palliative stenting.
ERCP 2-days prior allowed passage of endoscope to the level of the duodenum for biliary stenting, now with evidence of on-going obstruction.
ACS surgery had been consulted given his evidence of delayed emptying and possible gastric obstruction with known biliary obstruction and felt no surgical intervention was feasible.
# ACUTE RENAL INSUFFICIENCY - Patient presents with baseline creatinine of 0.7-0.9 now with admission creatinine of 1.4 in the setting of septic shock, hypotension and low urine output.
This likely represents poor forward flow and hypoperfusion with pre-renal azotemia in the setting of vasodilation and sepsis physiology generating hypotension.
# ASCITES - Likely malignant in the setting of know gallbladder carcinoma with metastatic involvement.
Now with septic shock picture in the setting of multiple sources of infection.
His RUQ ultrasound showed concern for no pneumobilia with possble obstruction at the level of his biliary stent.
# METASTATIC GALLBLADDER CARCINOMA, BLADDER CANCER - Metastatic gallbladder carcinoma currently receiving Gemzar/Cisplatinum.
Bladder carcinoma treated with primary resection and cystectomy with ileal conduit.
# DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSES - DVT in both posterior tibial veins on the right and one posterior tibial vein on the left in 2/29.
# HYPERTENSION - Hypotensive in the setting of sepsis, as noted above.
