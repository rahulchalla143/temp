Admission Date:  [**2172-4-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2172-5-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2143-7-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Vancomycin / Gleevec / Cefepime Hcl / Clindamycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: chest and neck pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 16368**] is a 28-year-old man with a history of biclonal leukemia, diagnosed in [**2169-12-20**] status post chemo initially and then after a relapse of his ALL, he underwent allo BMT transplant on [**2170-5-3**], but his ALL relapsed in [**2171-7-21**] and was treated with vincristine, prednisone, and Gleevec.
The Gleevec was discontinued because of a reaction to it.
Most recently he has received Clofarabine after which he had an aplastic-looking marrow and received a stem cell boost.
His most recent hospitalization was [**10-23**] until [**2172-3-26**] during which he was noted to have pulmonary nodules, and was treated empirically with ambisome, voriconazole, and initially capsofungin and was sent home on ambisome and voriconazole.
The patient states that he was in his usual state of good health until last night when he had gradual onset left neck to substernal chest pain described as "something squeezing in from my lungs," "pressure," 15/10 and pleurtic.
He also complains of neck pain which is worse with movement.
No associated SOB or diaphoresis.
Has had mild nausea since his discharge without emesis.
This pain is similar to pulmonary nodule pain he has had in the past.
He was given Morphine 8 mg iv and dilaudid 8mg iv for pain control and became hypotensive with VS 116, 78/44 while in the ED.
Seen by cardiology consult who felt not consistent with cardiogenic shock.
Biclonal leukemia: -Diagnosed [**12-23**] -- Presenting with sore throat, severe upper airway inflammation requiring intubation, and a WBC of 130,000.
-[**10-23**]- Received Clofarabine after which he had an aplastic-looking marrow and received a stem cell boost.
Prolonged Febrile Neutropenia complicated by severe infections including probable fungal infection with pulmonary nodules and mesenteric mass.
Transaminitis -- Liver bx with focal pmn aggregates, no evidence of GvHD [**6-21**].
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: PE: T 100.5 HR 115 BP 76/32 - 106/58 (current) R 16 %Sat 99 RA Pulsus [**7-29**] Gen: Fatigued, A&O x 3, appears mildly uncomfortable HEENT: ATNC, PERRLA, anicteric, OP clear, MMM Neck: Supple, no LAD, Chest: CTA bilat, no egophany or fremitus, resonant Cor: Tachy, nl S1 S2 no m/r, JVP flat Abd: Soft, nt/nd, no HSM/M hypoactive BS Ext: Warm, Skin: No rashes, petechiae.
IMPRESSION: Interval development of new left-sided patchy opacification, left lung base.
Chest/Abd/pelvis CT [**2172-4-19**]: 1) Hazy opacity within the right lower lobe, a finding that could partly related to atelectasis, although is suspicious for pneumonia given its asymmetry.
2) No evidence of pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
4) Decreased size of mesenteric mass, which is now not measurable, with minimal residual haziness in the mesentery.

He required levophed and aggressive fluid hydration to maintain SBP>100 and was started on fludrocotisone for possible adrenal insufficiency.
Pt had flat JVP and warm extremities, no evidence of tamponade.
He was ruled out for MI by enzymes, and cardiology consult did not not think picture was c/w cardiogenic shock.
Sepsis was considered and he was broadly covered on admission with ambisome, imipenem, voriconazole.
#ID: a) Pulmonary nodules: Pt had history of pulmonary nodules thought to be of fungal origin without positive cultures data.
He had been on empiric treatment for fungal process with ambisome and vorinazole for 3 months, then voriconazole alone since [**4-1**], but was off this for four days before admission.
Chest CT revealed no nodular infection but a RLL infiltrate concerning for CAP and on HD2 was started on levofloxacin.
At that same time he was started on Vancomycin since his allergy was questionable and he had a permanent tunneled line.
He developed periorbital edema and diffuse skin etyhema, elevated LFT's and eosinophilia thought initially due to vancomycin so this was stopped.
Infectious workup in looking for source of sepsis included urine, blood and sputum culture, fungal , AFB, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 14616**], mycoplasma, [**Name10 (NameIs) 14616**] urine Ag, galatomannan all of which were negative.
He was then started on voriconazole as below for risk of recurrence of fungal infection with immunosuppressive treatment for GVHD as below.
Elevated LFT's-Pt continued to have climbing LFT with a cholestatic picture initially thought to be due to drug reaction by both ID and dermatology.
Skin biopsy showed complete separation of dermis and epidermis consistent with drug rash.
Biopsy revealed diffuse biliary destruction consistent with GVHD although it was unclear if this was old or new.
He was continued on immunosuppressive therapy as above and on [**5-3**] was feeling well so plan was made for further workup and treatment of elevated LFT's as an outpt.
#Chest/Neck pain: T wave changes on EKG were non-diagnostic.
It didn't appear to be due to ischemia given he was ruled out for MI with serial enzymes and had no events on telemetry.
CTA showed no PE/aortic dissection.
Most likely cause of pain is pleuritic chest pain from pneumonia.
#Anemia: baseline hct was around 28 thought to be anemia of chronic diseae.
