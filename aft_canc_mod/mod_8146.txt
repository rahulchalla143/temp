End of [**Month (only) 116**], had right lower lobe pneumonia at [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 107**] hospital in NY after chemotherapy.
Had acute renal failure, placed on hemodialysis briefly, now resolved.
Transferred to St. [**Hospital 15000**] Hospital, course outlined above, briefly needed trach placementx2 (stoma from the first trach was too low and for that reason had a second stoma created) which was c/b pneumomediastinum with subcutaneous emphysema and false lumen and posterior tracheal wall injury; also found to have VRE growing from trach site.

The extent of the pre-existing left pleural effusion has markedly decreased, which leads to improved visibility of the left basal lung parenchyma and decrease in severity of the pre-existing atelectasis.
No evidence of newly appeared parenchymal opacities.
No pneumothorax.
There is edema within the subcutaneous soft tissues, most marked within the left antecubital fossa.
Procedure Report: Bronchoscopy Report [**2153-8-15**] Date: Wednesday, [**2153-8-15**] Birth Date: [**2092-8-25**] (60 years) Patient: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] ID #: [**Numeric Identifier 112038**] Endoscopists: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 112039**], MD  Indications: respratory failure , tracheostomy complication  Medications: per anesthesia records  Anesthesia: general Instrument: Flexible Scope: BF-XT160 Video Bronchoscope ([**Numeric Identifier 112040**])   Rigid Scope: black dumon bronchoscope   Ventilation: jet ventilation ( The Flexible Scope and Rigid Scope were used simultaneously. )
Equipment/Monitoring: Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated her understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
The procedure was performed for diagnostic purposes at the operating room.
There were no complications.
other findings: Rigid intubation was performed with a black rigid bronchoscope.
There was minimal granulation tissue.
The lower [**2-6**] of trachea had minimal mucosal injury.
Minimal Granulation tissue.
Minimal mucosal injury to the distal trachea.
Recommendations: Admit to ICU Will follow as inpatient Portable chest x ray post transbronchial biopsy to rule out pneumothorax  Additional notes: Patient medication list was reconciled.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Minimal mucosal injury to the lower third of the trachea.
Estimated blood loss = zero.

CT scan from St. [**Doctor Last Name 15000**] [**2153-8-9**] showed compressed L lower lobe, probably causing a R to L shunt leading to hypoxemia.
Based on CT scan on [**2153-8-6**], subcutaneous emphysema is prominent in anterior and posterior thorax which is likely contributing to hypoxemia and remarkably low P:F ratio.
IP and thoracic teams were contact[**Name (NI) **] and flexible/rigid bronchoscopy was performed on [**2153-8-15**] which revealed minimal wall injury to distal trachea; no fistula found.
She was transitioned to pressure support for ventilation however acheived low tidal volumes so was placed back on CMV mode.
She was on lansoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, which replaced omeprazole given use of NG tube for medications.
She was noted to have 12% eosinophils on her CBC/diff on admission, which could be consistent with an allergic reaction given recent use of antibiotics and other new medications or could be paraneoplastic in setting of known multiple myeloma.
Further workup for eosinophilia was deferred.
#Unstageable sacral decubitus ulcer: Pt came in with wound: clean, no active bleeding.
#Left upper arm swelling: Upon arrival, noticed patient had generalized anasarca and grossly edematous in all extremities, especially in the left upper arm.
With history of malignancy, ruled out thrombosis in venous system of left upper extremity.
An ultrasound was done on [**8-15**] which showed no venous thrombosis.
With h/o myeloma, at risk for recurrent renal insufficiency.
Olanzapine, scheduled, was on active pre-admission medication list, and this was changed to PRN agitation.
# elevated blood sugar: patient was on detemir insulin at St. [**Hospital 15000**] hospital, however during admission here tube feeds were held and patient was found to be hypoglycemic.
Transitional issues: - continued tracheostomy care and ventilator support - may benefit from further diuresis with IV lasix - consider increasing anti-hypertensive regimen if blood pressures continue to remain elevated - wound care of sacral decubitus ulcer  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
OLANZapine 2.5 mg PO BID:PRN agitation   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Hypoxemia, respiratory failure Multiple Myelmoa Unstageable sacral decubitus ulcer  Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable and respiratory status stable on vent, sedated.
Our interventional pulmonary team did a rigid bronchoscopy to look at the airways and determined there were no structural problems in your airways, but that the tracheostomy tube was out of place.
