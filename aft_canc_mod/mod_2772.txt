Admission Date:  [**2103-8-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2103-8-29**]  Date of Birth:   [**2040-9-13**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Fenard ICU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Elevated LFTs and hyponatremia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of AML status post allo-BMT in '[**94**] and recent hospitalization for pulmonary embolus now presenting status post right ACL tear, hemarthrosis, and elevated LFTs.
Patient was admitted at the [**Hospital1 188**] with shortness of breath on [**2103-7-18**].
He was found to have pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis in his right lower extremity, and atrial fibrillation.
He was not anticoagulated at the time due to a history of GI bleed in [**2103-4-15**].
Subsequently on [**7-26**], he had a fall at home leading to a right ACL tear, hemarthrosis, ecchymoses, hypotension, and was transferred to [**Hospital6 48646**].
He was also noted to be thrombocytopenic, hyponatremic, and with liver failure with an alkaline phosphatase of 1300, total bilirubin of 18.5, ALT of 1170, and AST of 1375.
Right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
Peptic ulcer disease.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Oropharynx without ulcers and with petechiae.
Neck examination:  No lymphadenopathy and no thyromegaly.
Abdominal examination is nontender and nondistended.
Extremities with lower extremity dermatitis and multiple ecchymoses.
The patient continued to have hypoxia and a large oxygen requirements.
Patient was empirically started on cefepime for possible recurrent pneumonia.
Throughout his hospital course, he was noted to have rapid atrial fibrillation with ventricular responses up to the 190s.
and a transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of greater than 55%, elongated left atrium, trace AR, 1+ MR with small pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade.
An Infectious Disease consult was obtained for optimal management of his pneumonia and his antibiotics were changed to meropenem.
Fungal coverage was also added on empirically to rule out a fungal process.
His shortness of breath mildly improved over this time, and his hyponatremia also improved throughout his hospital course.
On hospital day #10, the patient had an acute episode of rapid AFib with shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and was subsequently intubated for respiratory failure.
Following intubation, he became acutely hypotensive and required synchronized d-c cardioversion which unsuccessfully cardioverted him, but did decrease his tachycardia to the 100 range.
A bronchoscopy was performed on hospital day #10, which revealed frothy secretions in his left and right lower lobes.
A BAL was performed on the right middle lobe and lingula and was therefore subsequently sent for culture.
A CTA of the chest was performed to rule out recurrent pulmonary embolism.
This CTA revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolism, interval development of bilateral pleural effusions, and was then started on high dosed steroids.
On hospital day #13, the patient was successfully extubated, but continued to have episodes of atrial fibrillation with rates in the 150s.
The patient adamantly stated that he no longer wanted to be intubated and wanted to no longer having oral suctioning.
Despite extubation, the patient continued to have a profound hypoxia as well as continued episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation leading to tachypnea despite a diltiazem drip.
Amiodarone was added for attempted rhythm and rate control, but despite these medications, the patient continued to experience tachypnea.
By hospital day #15, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate and at 10:20 p.m., the covering resident was called to see the patient for asystole and absence of respirations and was declared dead at 10:20 p.m.
Atrial fibrillation.
Acute myelogenous leukemia status post allogeneic bone marrow transplant.
Recurrent pulmonary emboli.
Right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
Cytomegalovirus colitis.
