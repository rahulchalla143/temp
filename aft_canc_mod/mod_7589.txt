.- New increase in diameter of the intrahepatic ducts at the right lobe with no apparent mass in the liver.
.- Enlarged pancreatic head but no distinct mass is seen.
CXR [**2130-8-10**]: Final Report PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST  REASON FOR EXAM:  Recent acute diastolic heart failure, status post diuresis and left thoracentesis.
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
Mild pulmonary edema is stable.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, are stable.
There is no pneumothorax or new lung abnormalities.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mild depressed with inferolateral and basal inferior hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
The diastolic width of the pericardial effusion anterior to the right ventricular free wall is <0.5 cm.
There is right atrial collapse and mild right ventricular diastolic indentation/collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/early tamponade physiology.
Small angiomyolipoma in the left kidney.
No evidence for renal artery stenosis.
Rare atypical epithelioid cells in a background of reactive  	 mesothelial cells and inflammatory cells.
Note: A cell block is pending and will be reported  	 separately.
The patient's prior lymph node biopsy S12-7330  	 was also reviewed for morphologic comparison.
Cell block:  Pleural fluid, cell block:            NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Brief Hospital Course: 74F with h/o recently dx pancreatic adenocarcinoma, DM2, type 2 DM who had standard outpatient CT scan, complicated with code blue for hypoxia, likely secondary to acute pulmonary edema.
# Pulmonary edema: Etiology of of acute pulmonary edema was not entirely clear but was most likely secondary to hypertension in the setting of SBP in the 200s during the event.
Per her chart, she was not thought to have a h/o CHF however PCP is not in the [**Hospital1 18**] system and no echocardiogram in OMR.
Increased osmotic load after receiving IV contrast was also considered, as was ACS although EKG was not suggestive of this and troponin trended down from 0.12 to 0.11.
She received 40mg IV lasix on the day of admission and her respiratory status improved markedly after being only 800cc negative.
Due to a rise in the Cr to 1.3 and physical appearance of being dry, additional lasix was not given.
Acute valve disease was additionally considered and she was ordered for a TTE.
The echo revealed EF 55%, mild pulm HTN with PASP ~35, inferolateral and inferior basal hypokinesis.
There was also a small pericardial effusion with right atrial collapse and mild right ventricular diastolic indentation/collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/early tamponade physiology.
To evaluate for cardiac ischemia (trop leak, local wall motion abnl and unexplained pulmonary edema) and the pericardial effusion, cardiology was consulted.
Their assessment was that the event was most consistent with diastolic dysfunction and recommended initiation of labetalol and lipitor - in addition to the ACEI and aspirin she already was on.
Renal U/S was obtained to r/o renal artery stenosis as etiology of acute pulmonary edema (no stenosis identified).
In addition, given the gemcytobine, non-cardiac pulmonary edema and PVOD were considered in the differential.
# Pleural effusion: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was able to wean down to RA but desaturatd with ambulation.
A lateral decub CXR was obtained and revealed L>R pleural effusion.
Fluid studies - including cytology - as noted above were negative for malignancy.
# Anemia- low haptoglobin suggesive of hemolysis.
Hematology looked at smear, only saw one or two schistocytes, making microangiopathic hemolytic anemia unlikely.
There was no evidence of GI bleed, and ferritin was 487, suggesting iron deficiency was not a likely etiology.
# HTN: Patient was hypotensive periintubation likely due to propofol in combination with diuresis.
Home meds were restarted, with close monitoring of renal function.
CHRONIC ISSUES  # Pancreatic adenocarcinoma: s/p 6 cycles of gemcitabine (most recent [**7-21**]) and had cyberknife.
# GERD: She was given pantoprazole for stress ulcer ppx.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: - Acute pulmonary edema - Small pericardial effusion - Hypertension - Pancreatic Cancer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the intensive care unit for shortness of breath and worsened oxygenation.
Chest x-ray revealed fluids in the lung (pulmonary edema) and you were given intravenous diuretics to help eliminate the extra fluid.
A number of studies were done to evaluate the cause of this acute event: an ultrasound of the kidneys revealed no abnormalities.
Ultrasound of the heart revealed good pumping function, but small amounts of fluid around the heart and an area of reduced motion in a segment of the heart wall.
