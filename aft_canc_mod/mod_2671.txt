HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50-year-old female here for liver transplant for hepatitis C cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma.
Recent CT chest was negative for cancer.
She also had portal hypertension, portal systemic encephalopathy, esophageal varices, and radiofrequency ablation for her hepatocellular carcinoma.
A bone scan on [**2123-8-12**] demonstrated no evidence of metastatic disease and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy in the femurs and tibias, left greater than right.
Most recent CT of the abdomen on [**2123-8-5**] demonstrated no residual tumor after radiofrequency ablation site in superomedial segment 8, a 1-cm lesion concerning for early hepatocellular carcinoma, a 5-mm calculus over the lower pole of the right kidney.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for depression, anxiety.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for mom with CVA x3 who is alive.
Lactulose  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denied any recent illness.
She does complain of positive headaches left frontal area.
History of tension headaches.
No rhinorrhea, no sore throat, no nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, no dysuria.
General: No acute distress.
Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.
Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis or edema, no calf tenderness.
No focal deficits.
No complications.
After the papaverine infusion, the pulse became excellent and there was an excellent diastolic thrill.
Evaluation of the left hepatic vein, hepatic artery and portal vein were limited by the presence of overlying support structures and the color flow was demonstrated but the wave forms were poorly assessed.
Two oval heterogeneously hypoechoic structures were noted adjacent to the IVC measuring 4 cm and 3.6 cm in greatest dimensions, respectively, and this was felt to represent small retrohepatic fluid collections.
The pathology report from the explant demonstrated hepatocellular carcinoma and gallbladder with mild, chronic cholecystitis and no malignancy identified.
A chest x-ray demonstrated right internal jugular line tip resting in the proximal SVC level.
She was maintained on heparin, low dose, for a small hepatic artery.
The pain was managed with initially morphine and later changed to Percocet.
She did complain of some loose stool.
Stool was sent for C. difficile and subsequently negative.
She had a low-grade temperature.
Given concern for slight increase in alkaline phosphatase on postop day 7, alkaline phosphatase was 102, in the catheterization lab by cardiology, an angiogram was performed to assess the hepatic artery.
Selective celiac and SMA angiography as well as nonselective abdominal aortography was performed via access from bilateral common femoral arteries.
Findings demonstrated no flow- limiting disease in the transplant hepatic artery.
There was no significant disease in the celiac artery, SMA and bilateral renal arteries proximally.
At this time a right hepatic venogram demonstrated an angiographically high-grade stenosis at the right hepatic-IVC anastomosis.
Biopsy results included marked bile duct proliferation with acute cholangitis.
Biliary obstruction or ischemia could not be excluded.
There were no features of acute cellular rejection.
On [**10-20**], she underwent an abdominal CT that demonstrated a normal transplant liver on CT, with normal parenchymal enhancement, patent hepatic veins and inferior vena cava, portal veins and hepatic artery.
There was a moderate amount of stenosis noted at the anastomotic site between the hepatic veins and recipient IVC, and moderate stenosis at the portal vein anastomosis site.
A small amount of intraabdominal ascites was noted.
There was no collection.
Minor right basilar atelectasis was noted.
Cannulation of the biliary and pancreatic ducts were successful and deep with sphincterotome, using a free-hand technique was done.
The procedure was mildly difficult.
The biliary tree was narrowed at the level of the anastomosis but there was no stricture.
The course and caliber of the duct was normal with no evidence of spilling defects, masses, chronic pancreatitis or other abnormalities.
She remained afebrile post-ERCP and amylase postprocedure was 53 and 23.
Of note, an acute pulmonary embolus affecting at least the left lower lobe segmental branches was noted.
Interval occlusion of the accessory right hepatic vein with associated perfusion abnormality was noted in segment 6 of the liver.
An apparent narrowing at the presumed portal vein anastomotic site and apparent narrowing of the hepatic veins as they entered the recipient's IVC were also seen on the previous study.
A CTA of the chest was done to evaluate for PE confirmation, and to rule out a saddle embolus.
Impression included acute pulmonary embolus affecting the left lower lobe segmental branches and partial thrombus in the suprahepatic IVC.
Of note, the patient had complained of some left-sided shortness of breath 2 days prior to the chest CTA.
Lungs were slightly diminished in the bases.
Abdomen was soft, positive bowel sounds, positive flatus.
She did complain of some loose stool.
A HIDA scan was done that demonstrated no evidence of bile leak.
Bilateral lower extremity noninvasive studies were done.
There was normal phasic venous flow and increased venous return with calf compressions on color Doppler.
Conclusion was that there was no right or left lower limb deep venous thrombosis demonstrated.
On the duplex ultrasound of the liver, it demonstrated no abnormal intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
There were patent hepatic portal veins and there patent hepatic arteries.
There was a small peri-transplant collection noted posteriorly.
Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma.
Anxiety and depression.
Diabetes type 2.
Hepatic vein stenosis and recipient inferior vena cava     and portal vein anastomosis.
