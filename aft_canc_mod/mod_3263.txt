He also became hypotensive to BPs of 80s/50s.
CTA was done for pleuritic CP that showed a subsegmental PE, thus he was started on heparin gtt and given dilaudid for pain.

Relative gasless abdomen is present with no air-fluid levels identified.
No soft tissue calcifications are identified.
IMPRESSION: No air-fluid levels or free intra-abdominal air identified.
There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.
No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Left lower lobe segmental pulmonary embolism.
Wedge-shaped peripheral consolidation in the superior segment of the right lower lobe.
Differential considerations include infectious or inflammatory processes; atelectasis is less likely.
Thoracic vertebral compression fracture, unchanged in comparison to [**2144-9-10**].
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2144-11-23**] 5:05 PM IMPRESSION: No DVT in the bilateral lower extremities.
Worsening right lower lobe opacity over the period of last five days most likely representing a worsening infectious process.
Given the presence of pulmonary embolism in left lower lobe the worsening left lower lobe opacity might represent infarction as well as atelectasis or infection, determination based on the chest radiograph cannot be made.
There is a slightly improved aeration of lung bases due to resolution of atelectasis.
No appreciable pleural effusion is seen.
[**2144-12-4**] CXR: FINDINGS: Comparison study [**12-3**], there is no interval change.
These could represent areas related to pulmonary emboli.
Findings are most consistent with cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, although a component of viral pneumonia is possible.
Multilevel compression fractures are similar to [**2144-11-21**].
Brief Hospital Course: 54 yo M with AML s/p allo-BMT with chronic GVHD of liver, skin now with fever and pulmonary embolism.
Fever/RSV: The patient was admitted to the MICU for inital hypotension, PE, Acute renal insufficency and increased oxygen requirement.
The patient reported recent sick contacts and due to his respiratory complaints, a pulmonary process was the most consistant site of infection.
He was hypotensive in the ED (SBP to 80's), but this resolved with IV fluids and was felt to be consistant with pre-septic physiology.
Nasal swab was positive for RSV, sputum with gram positive cocci and yeast.
Patient's shortness of breath resolved.
It appears that the RSV infection is primarily an upper respiratory tract infection as there is no evidence of RSV pneumonia.
A RUQ ultrasound was performed to assess pt's chronic complaint of RUQ tenderness.
Ultrasound was without evidence of acute processes consistent with this pain.
Increased over his initial hospital course due to fluid resusitation.
An Echo was performed which showed hyperdynamic LVEF.
Avascular necrosis of hips bilateral: Outpatient pain regimen continued.
Obstructive Sleep Apnea:  The was given CPAP for his OSA.
He did not tolerate the face mask or nasal mask.
