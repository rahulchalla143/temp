Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids Otherwise normal colonoscopy to proximal ascending colon Poor visualization of the cecum, ascending colon and sigmoid colon  [**2116-6-5**] TAGGED RBC BLEEDING SCAN: No active gastrointestinal bleeding is identified.
[**2116-6-8**] TAGGED RBC BLEEDING SCAN: No evidence of GI bleed at 90 min and at 6 hours.
She required two units of RBC's after having ongoing blood BM's with the colonoscopy prep.
Colonosocpy performed on [**2116-6-3**] prior to transfer to the floor showed multiple divertculi but no active bleeding.
After the colonoscopy she had no more blood loss for two days and was about to be discharged on [**2116-6-5**] when she rebled.
She required one unit of RBC's on [**2116-6-5**] to maintain Hct > 28 (the higher transfusion threshold was chosen because of the cardiac ischemia earlier in the week (see below)).
Although she did not have blood loss from below thorughout the day, the scan was repeated about six hours after the morning study in the hopes that the source could be found (unfortunately, it was not).
Her last episode of blood loss was in the morning of [**2116-6-8**].
Ultimately, it was suspected that her bleeding was secondary to diverticulosis, although the source was never definitely found on colonoscopy or tagged RBC scans.
CHEST PAIN: On [**6-2**] in the evening, she also complained of chest pain.
EKG showed diffuse ST changes, but unchanged from priors.
Cyclic cardiac enzymes did increase, and it was flet she had some demand ischemia in the setting of the bleed.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 616**] the one episode of chest pain, she remained asymptomatic throughout the rest of the hospitalization.
UTI: Although she denied symptoms, she was found to have an E. coli UTI.
Insulin Glargine  Subcutaneous   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: (1) Lower GI bleed (2) Diverticulosis (3) Anemia  Secondary Diagnoses: (1) Chronic kidney disease   Discharge Condition: Stable-- satting in the mid to upper 90's on room air; no shortness of breath; no blood loss from below in 48+ hours prior to discharge; hematocrit stable and hemodynamically stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a bleed from your GI tract which was likely from your diverticuli, although the exact source of the bleeding could not be found on the colonoscopy or tagged red blood cell scans.
If you cannot reach your doctor or if you have a lot of blood loss, feel dizzy or feel weak, you should return to the emergency room for an evaluation.
One of your blood pressure medications (lisinopril) was also stopped because of the risk of low blood pressure with bleeding.
