Admission Date:  [**2160-11-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-12-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2095-8-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2969**] Chief Complaint: Ischemic necrosis of right lung with abscess formation.
[**2160-12-1**]: Flexible bronchoscopy.
Postoperatively, this was complicated by a severe pneumonia treated with antibiotics with very slow resolution.
She returned in followup with worsening cough and persistent infiltrate in the lung.
Bronchoscopy showed inability to cannulate the right middle lobe, making it worrisome for middle lobe torsion syndrome.
We did obtain an airway CT with IV contrast, which showed poor perfusion to the right lung.
A perfusion scan was obtained that showed essentially no perfusion to the right lung, confirming ischemic necrosis of unclear etiology.

CXR: [**2160-12-14**]  Again seen is the hydropneumothorax of the right lung, comprised of approximately [**2-4**] fluid and including a small amount of air at the lung base.
[**2160-12-11**]  The right- sided hydrothorax persists and the air-fluid level is at the height corresponding to 3 cm above the carina.
As before there exist a few small air-fluid cavities within the gross fluid collection which is bordered below by the diaphragm  [**2159-12-9**] There are several lucent regions overlying the fluid in the left hemithorax.
Opacification at the left base is consistent with atelectasis, though supervening pneumonia cannot be definitely excluded.
[**2160-11-30**] Stable appearance of right lower lobe parenchymal opacification and loculations of air in the right upper lobe space.
Marked attenuation of the right lower lobe blood supply, demonstrated by this first contrast-enhanced postoperative CT scan may be responsible for progression of right lower lobe consolidation to necrosis since [**2160-10-24**].
Persistent right middle lobe collapse since [**0-**] be due to now completely occluding stricture or impaction of inflamed or otherwise narrowed bronchus, less likely torsion.
No decrease in size of large, persistent, airfilled right pleural space; possible right lower lobe bronchopleural fistula.
Decrease in fluid volume could be due to two-way transit through the fistula.
Left lower lobe ground-glass opacities, possibly aspiration of secretions from right bronchopleural fistula.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 101073**] presented to the ED on [**2161-11-30**] with a persistent cough and low grade temps.
While in the ED she was pan cultured, CXR showed right lower lobe  parenchymal opacification and loculation of air in the right upper lobe space.
She was started on IV Vancomycin and Zosyn for pulmonary infiltrate and elevated white count.
Thoracic surgery was consulted and recommended a bronchoscopy which was done on [**2160-12-1**] and showed anatomic distortion of the right middle lobe causing narrowing and compression.
Subsequently a Chest CT showed no perfusion of the remaining right lung.
A V/Q scan confirmed no ventilation or perfusion.
A preoperative work-up was done for Ischemic necrosis of right lung with abscess formation.
Her pain was managed by the acute pain service with an Bupivacaine Epidural.
On POD6 she had an episode of Atrial fibrillation a rate in the 180's with spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm.
She continued to have intermittent atrial fibrillation.
Saline     Solution Sig: Three (3) ML Miscellaneous three times a day as needed for cough.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Right upper lobe mass s/p RULobectomy [**10-11**] H/o elevated liver enzymes, initially thought to be due to autoimmune hepatitis but liver biopsy at [**Hospital1 2025**] ruled this out.
Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Call Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 4738**] office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4741**] if experience: -Fever > 101 or chills -Increased shortness of breath, or sputum production -Chest pain -You may shower.
