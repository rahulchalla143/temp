HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old male with a past medical history significant for myelodysplastic syndrome diagnosed eight years ago and multiple basal cell carcinomas who presented with a 3-day history of dark red/bloody urine.
The patient also complained of a painful skin lesion on the left flank.
Regarding the hematuria, the patient reported painless hematuria with urine that was essentially dark red and never grossly bloody times one week.
He denied any history of trauma as well as any dysuria, increased urinary frequency, hesitancy, or difficulty voiding.
He also denied abdominal pain.
The patient denied bright red blood per rectum, melena, hematemesis, hemoptysis, or epistaxis.
The patient reported that his myelodysplastic syndrome had been stable until the Spring of this year when he started to feel very tired and lethargic.
The patient was status post a bone marrow biopsy on [**2126-6-18**] that showed decreased erythroid elements with occasional dysplastic forms and decreased myeloid elements with limited maturation.
However, there was no evidence of progression to acute leukemia.
The patient also has a left axillary lesion which he says started out like a blister and has been present for three to four days prior to admission.
Myelodysplastic syndrome diagnosed eight years ago; recently transfusion dependent.
Squamous cell carcinoma.
Question history of inferior wall myocardial infarction.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:   Mohs surgery for basal cell carcinoma.
He had a brother who died of leukemia at the age of three and father who died of heart disease.
ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.
There was no thyromegaly, and no cervical lymphadenopathy, and no jugular venous distention.
His lungs revealed bibasilar crackles.
His heart examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur.
His abdomen was soft and nontender, with positive bowel sounds.
He also had a palpable spleen tip.
His back revealed no costovertebral angle tenderness.
His nose appeared slightly disfigured which was consistent with prior Mohr surgery.
He had a similar-appearing 5-cm to 6-cm pink plaque under his left axilla which; both of which were extremely tenderness to palpation.
He had no focal deficits.
His rectal examination revealed occult-blood positive brown stool.
There was also occasional uric acid crystals noted.
It was unclear whether the patient's presentation with pancytopenia was secondary to blasts crisis; although, this was felt to be unlikely given that he has had a recent bone marrow biopsy which was negative for blasts, and his peripheral smear was also negative for blasts.
His coagulopathy was treated with transfusions of fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K.  On [**7-30**], the patient was seen by his outpatient hematologist who questioned whether the patient's skin lesions and hematuria could be secondary to septic emboli.
On [**7-31**], the patient's coagulations were all evaluated despite vitamin K, and there was noted to be minimal correction of the anemia and thrombocytopenia despite transfusions.
They felt that the lesions were most consistent with a neutrophilic dermatosis such as pyodermic gangrenosum versus Sweet's disease which has a high incidence in myelodysplastic syndrome.
Also on the differential diagnosis was exanthematic gangrenosum due to Pseudomonas infection as well as a deep fungal infection and cutaneous leukemia/lymphoma.
The left axillary lesion was biopsied and sent for bacterial, and fungal, and atypical mycobacterial cultures.
On [**8-1**], the patient was felt to be functionally neutropenic; and given the question of Pseudomonas infection, he was started on intravenous ceftazidime.
On their differential was bacterial infections; namely furunculosis or xanthomatous granulosum.
They also considered Sweet's disease in malignancy associated conditions.
A renal ultrasound was also performed on [**8-1**] which showed multiple stones in the collecting system, but no evidence of hydronephrosis or renal abscess.
On [**8-2**], the patient's skin biopsy Gram stain revealed 2+ polys and no organisms, and the aerobic culture grew out coagulase-positive Staphylococcus.
The preliminary pathology report on the skin biopsy was as follows; clusters of plasma cells with infiltrative lymphocytes and neutrophils.
On the differential was pyoderma versus infection versus plasma cell neoplasm.
On [**8-3**], a serum protein electrophoresis and urine protein electrophoresis; which had been sent out earlier in the week, came back positive for monoclonal spike in the SPEP and two abnormal bands on the UPEP.
They said that overall, the association between myelodysplastic syndrome and multiple myeloma is not known, but they felt that people with malignancy and myeloma could develop severe disseminated intravascular coagulation which was consistent with the patient's clinical picture.
The CT of the chest was significant for a 1.2-cm nodule in the right upper lung adjacent to the major fissure.
There was no lymphadenopathy that was noted in the mediastinum, in the axilla, or in the pelvis.
On [**8-6**], the patient's diagnosis of myeloma was questioned by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2539**] (who was the patient's outpatient hematologist), and it was felt that the monoclonal spike most likely represented myoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance rather than myeloma.
In the meantime, the Infectious Disease workup continued; and [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus, cytomegalovirus, cryptococcal, and coccidia serologies were checked; which all came back as negative.
Also, Babesia thick and thin smears were checked given a history of transfusions.
On [**8-7**], the ceftazidime was discontinued after eight days secondary to no known organisms.
The patient developed increasing transfusion dependence.
At this point, he required transfusions to stop bleeding from his intravenous sites and from his biopsy sites.
On [**8-8**], the patient had frank bleeding from his skin biopsy site that required two hours of manual pressure and resuturing to achieve hemostasis.
Also, the issues of access were raised given that the patient had only one peripheral intravenous line and was in need of multiple blood products.
Also, on the evening of [**8-8**], the patient had an adverse reaction while getting transfused with cryoprecipitate.
At that point, it was felt that given that the skin biopsies were nondiagnostic that the question of whether the patient was transforming into an acute leukemia needed to be readdressed.
This bone marrow biopsy returned the week later and was consistent with myelodysplastic syndrome with no evidence of acute leukemia.
Subsequently, from [**8-9**] to [**8-15**], the patient continued to require aggressive blood product support through his disseminated intravascular coagulation with daily transfusions of platelets, packed red blood cells, cryoprecipitate, and fresh frozen plasma.
On [**8-14**], the patient became acutely hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 90s.
On [**8-15**], the patient's repeat skin biopsy was read as consistent with intracellular organisms.
Toxoplasmosis stains done were positive, and the diagnosis of cutaneous toxoplasmosis was made with a question of toxoplasma-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation.
He was also started on G-CSF given his profound neutropenia and the possibility of a granulocytosis with a sulfa regimen.
Multiple urine cultures from [**8-14**] to [**8-16**] were positive for enterococcus.
However, on [**8-16**], the patient was started on vancomycin for an enterococcus urinary tract infection.
On the morning of [**8-17**], the patient had multiple sets of blood cultures which came back positive as gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
He had also been spiking fevers, and this was felt to be secondary to Staphylococcus bacteremia.
He was also on Flagyl at this point for stools positive for Clostridium difficile.
On the evening of [**8-17**], the patient complained of [**4-12**] chest pain.
His chest pain was treated with sublingual nitroglycerin, morphine, and Ativan.
Several hours later, the patient again complained of chest pain, and at this time was markedly tachypneic with a respiratory rate in the 30s and a heart rate in the 100s.
A blood gas was checked at this time which revealed a respiratory alkalosis with a large AA gradient.
An electrocardiogram was checked which showed ischemic changes across the precordium as well as in the lateral leads.
An electrocardiogram was again checked, and that showed that the patient was in atrial fibrillation.
The patient was also tachycardic to the 180s and was given intravenous diltiazem with minimal effect.
He was also placed with a femoral line given that his peripherally inserted central catheter line was infected and felt to be the source of his Staphylococcus bacteremia.
On the evening of [**8-19**], the patient was transferred back from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the floor initially in sinus rhythm; however, the patient converted back to atrial fibrillation shortly thereafter.
It was noted that his disseminated intravascular coagulation appeared to be stabilized.
Social Work and the Palliative Care Service were involved with helping the patient deal with this decision and helping the family also cope with the imminent loss of their father.
