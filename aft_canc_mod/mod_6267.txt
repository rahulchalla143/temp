This morning the patient reports sudden vomiting of ~500cc of bright red blood with some dark clot about an hour after waking up.
He denies having had nausea, abdominal pain, lightheadness, syncope, shortness or breath or chest pain.
He currently complains only of low energy and mild abdominal discomfort, both present for the past month.
He has had no recurrent hematemesis.
Of note he has had one similar episode of hematemesis in [**12/2105**] 5 days after his small bowel bypass procedure.

Oncologic history: Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 32153**] is a 56-year-old gentleman with a history of diabetes who originally presented on [**2105-5-14**] with a chief complaint of jaundice, weight loss, erratic blood glucose measurements, early satiety, increasing foul smelling flatulence, variations in his stool and GERD symptoms.
He then underwent an ERCP with stent placement at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2105-5-15**] and was noted to have a stricture in the distal bile duct as well as a tortuous pancreatic duct and calcification in the pancreatic head.
However, after returning from his vacation around [**2105-6-8**], he began to experience gradually worsening upper abdominal pain and fevers and was treated for cholangitis.
Brushings were obtained but were negative for malignancy.
EUS and needle biopsy showed an ill-defined mass in the head of the pancreas and surgery was consulted for the possibility of a local procedure, which was planned for [**2105-6-22**].
The patient underwent surgery on [**2105-6-22**], but due to the operative findings of tumor invasion of the SMV and SMA, the procedure was converted to a palliative bypass with Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy/gastroenterostomy and cholecystectomy due to the locally advanced nature of the disease.
Three core biopsies were obtained of the pancreatic mass with the pathology revealing chronic pancreatitis with atypical glands suspicious for adenocarcinoma.
This surgery was complicated by wound infection with gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains on culture.
The wound was reopened at the bedside and he was restarted on Zosyn.
He was discharged home with a wound VAC.
Treatment with gemcitabine has been complicated by neutropenia and abdominal pain and fever due to a closed loop bowel obstruction secondary to tumor, for which the patient underwent an ex-lap with by-pass of a dilated pancreaticobiliary drainage limb on [**2106-1-18**].
Father and uncle: abdominal aneurysm.
PHYSICAL EXAM GENERAL: Appears pale and fatigued but in no acute distress.

EGD [**3-4**]: not official read: gastritis, no active bleed  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 61610**] is a 57yo with metastatic pancreatic cancer admitted with one episode of ~500cc hematemeis.
Hematemesis - resolved spontaneously, thought [**2-1**] to tumor locally invasive into the upper GI tract leading to bleed or gasritis [**2-1**] nsaids.
Patient showed no signs of bleeding while inpt, hct remained stable, started on protonix gtt, then transitioned to PO protonix.
EGD performed by GI, signs of gastritis and radiation enteritis, no signs of active bleed.
Abnormal liver function tests - Elevated INR.
These are consistent with poor synthetic function and liver injury.
This is likely secondary to known invasion of tumor into his liver.
Given ongoing bleeding correction of coagulopathy is warranted.
Pancreatic Cancer - Patient has metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 78772**] pt while inpatient, with tentative plan for no additional chemotherapy.
Pain - Chronic abdominal pain secondary to tumor.
Insulin dependent diabetes - continued on lantus half dose and iss.
