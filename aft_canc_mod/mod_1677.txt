Hypoglycemia:  Patient had a recent CT on [**2134-8-12**], which showed progressive disease per primary oncologist.
Patient had decreased appetite for a few days prior to admission, and his recent hypoglycemic episode was most likely secondary to decreased PO intake.
Patient has an ileal conduit, and thus he may have chronic bacteriuria.
Patient does not endorse any symptoms, and urine cultures grew Klebsiella Oxytoca.
# Metabolic Acidosis:  The patient had persistently low HCO3 on this admission, which was thought to be secondary to his ileal neobladder.
An ABG was performed on the patient, which showed a normal pH, but a decreased CO2 to 20, significant for a chronic process.
The patient has an ileal conduit, and a metabolic acidosis is normally found in this setting when there is increased transit time in the ileoconduit (i.e.
possible stomal stenosis).
# Atrial fibrillation:  The patient has a history of Atrial fibrillation and was continued on his home dose of dofetilide.
He is not anticoagulated secondary to a recent GI bleed, but he remained on ASA 81 mg daily during this admission.
Hypertension:  The patient has a h/o hypertension and is currently on dofetilide.
He was continued on this medication throughout his hospital stay and did not have any acute events.
GERD with recent UGI bleed:  Patient has a history of a recent GI bleed.
# Code: Full  Medications on Admission: Dofetilide 375 mcg twice a day dexamethasone 1.5 mg daily omeprazole 20 mg [**Hospital1 **] nadolol 20 mg daily (pt unsure if he still takes this med) AndroGel 1% pump (occasional use only) vitamin C 1000 mg daily aspirin 81 mg a day simethicone 125 mg 2-4 times/day Sirolimus 2 mg daily - stopped on [**8-10**] spironolactone/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 daily - stopped [**7-30**]   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Insulinoma Hypoglycemia  Secondary: Metabolic non-gap acidosis Atrial Fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Good.
