The [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] was called, and a new right facial droop, leftward gaze deviation, and right hemiplegia were noted.
CT head was negative for acute hemorrhage.
Based on a time last "normal" of around noon (when the patient was noted to be moving all extremities), tPA was given, but subsequently the perfusion images showed hyperperfusion of an area in the left cortex, more suggestive of seizure.
At that point tPA was stopped, and the patient was given ativan 1 mg IV x 2 and keppra 1000 mg IV x 1 without improvement in his mental status.
However, EKG was done at 3:30 p.m., showing new lateral ST depressions.
Past Medical History: PMHx:Hypertension, Hyperlipedemia, IHD h/o MI in [**2114**] with stents placed, Systolic dysfunction, CVA [**2117**], Type 2 DM, Anxiety/Depression.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding GU: foley in place Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no cyanosis Neuro: Non-responsive to sternal rub.
Pupils equal 4 mm and sluggish bilaterally.
Withdraws slightly to pain on left side.
No responsive on left side.
Lungs: Diffusely rhonchorous.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops GU: foley in place Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no cyanosis Neuro: Non-responsive to sternal rub.
[**2123-2-20**] CXR - There has been interval increase in size in left lower lobe atelectasis and new or newly appearing left pleural effusion.
Mild vascular congestion is stable.
Right lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged.
[**2123-2-20**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST - Increased edema and sulcal effacement, predominantly within the left frontal lobe and superior left parietal lobe.
This could be secondary to persistent status epilepticus, though an infarction would be difficult to exclude.
No acute hemorrhage.
MICROBIOLOGIC DATA: .
[**2123-2-19**] MRSA screen - pending [**2123-2-19**] Blood culture - pending [**2123-2-21**] Blood culture - pending  Brief Hospital Course: 66M with metastatic pancreatic cancer (status-post Whipple procedure in [**2119**]), CAD (s/p PCI), CHF (LVEF 35-40%), h/o CVA (without residual deficits), DM, HTN, who initially presented for ERCP in the setting of biliary obstruction attributed to tumor burden, with subsequent development of right hemiparesis and non-responsiveness thought to be related to non-convulsive status epilepticus, who is status-post intubation for hypoxemia and airway protection with subsequent extubation, with hospital course complicated by hypotension (now off pressor support) and pneumoperitoneum who has shown minimal neurologic improvement.
Given his pancreatic cancer, pneumoperitoneum and poor neurologic status, the family opted for comfort care measures.
