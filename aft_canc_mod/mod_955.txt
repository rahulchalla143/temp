Pt presents to ED today after feeling nauseasous and states he had 40 cc of fresh bloody emesis.
He didn't c/o dizzinesss or lightheadedness.
Originally felt to be a small lymphocytic lymphoma but new, more aggressive behavior is suggestive of NHL.
Chronic afib, has refused coumadin in past for side effects 4.

Hearing loss 10.
ARF from hydronephrosis due to lymphoma   Social History: No smoking, rare ETOH, married, lives in [**Location **], former prof.  chemistry c hx exposure to organic compounds.
No cervical LAD.
No oral ulcers or exudates.
[**2188-2-17**] EGD: Stomach:  Excavated Lesions Multiple ulcers were found in the antrum and stomach body and incisura.
Most of the ulcers were small and clean based.There was one large ulcer in the incisura, which was likely the source of bleeding and seen during the last endoscopy and had been previously injected and cauterized.
There are bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
There are also opacities seen at the bases bilaterally, which may be secondary to underlying fluid or aspiration given the patient's clinical history.
No overt pulmonary edema is identified.
[**2188-2-18**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation with PVCs or aberrant ventricular conduction  LVH with secondary repolarization abnormality Extensive ST-T changes are probably due to ventricular hypertrophy Since previous tracing, no significant change .
#GIB: Most likely cause for GI bleeding is gastric lymphoma, considering the malignant aspect of the lesion on prior endoscopy and worsening CT scan of the abdomen showing worsening retroperitoneal masses.
A surgical evaluation confirmed that this patient is a poor surgical candidiate and that in the event of a re-bleed, angio would be the ideal modality for treatment.
Per pt's son, there was an initial request for a bx of gastric ulcers to determine whether they were malignant or not.
In setting of high risk procedure and pt's wishes to not continue with further XRT and invasive procedures or surgery, no further EGD or gastric biopsies done.
#Cardiac Ischemia/NSTEMI: Pt has ischemic CM c ECHO from last admission showing new areas of hypo and dyskinesis, showed global hypokinesis and a depressed EF from 40% to 30-35%, possibly from stunned myocardium.
Now c new elevated troponin T up to 0.41.
Last admission up to 1.4   Held ASA and BBlock considering stomach ulcer and hemodynamic instability.
Pt never c/o chest pain.
He was restarted on his BB for HTN without any problems.
Not a candidate at this point for ACE, BBlock or any CHF medication d/2 hemodynamic instability.
#Renal Insufficiency: Pt has hx of Rnal Failure c Creatinit up to 2.2 secondary to hydronephrosis d/2 retrop mass.His Cr.
#Gastric lymphoma: The Heme-Onc team recommended no further treatment of the lymphoma at this time.
