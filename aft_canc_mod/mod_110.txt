The pulmonary vasculature is normal without evidence of CHF.
There is a right chest wall Port-A-Cath with the tip in the cavoatrial junction.
There is a patchy opacity in the right perihilar region and infrahilar region with nodular densities, which is likely due to post- radiation changes.
No definite evidence of pneumonia is seen.
There are surgical clips in the gallbladder fossa and subcutaneous tissues in the left abdomen.
No evidence of pneumonia.
The liver appears echogenic consistent with fatty liver.
Multiple rounded hypoechoic lesions are seen within the liver, the largest measuring 2.5 cm in largest dimension.
There is no hydronephrosis or stones.
Multiple hypoechoic lesions seen within the liver corresponding to findings on CT performed [**2137-10-18**].
These findings are suggestive of liver metastases.
The liver is echogenic consistent with fatty liver.
However, other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease, including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis, cannot be excluded on the study.
CXR [**2137-11-4**]: History of metastatic breast cancer with fever.
No pneumothorax.
No new pulmonary consolidation or pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for pneumonia or other change since prior film of [**2137-10-31**].

The source of fever remains unclear as final urine and blood cultures are negative and repeat x-ray showed no pneumonia(Port-A-Cath was a concern although the site looked clean, but the patient remained afebrile off of vancomycin).
New anemia was felt likely due to chemotherapy as other cell lines also decreased.
For GI consulted in ED and no acute recs for colonoscopy/ imaging.
Elevated LFTs- Was felt to be secondary to liver mets and/or Gemzar.
Pt did not have any abdominal complaints.
U/S of abdomen showed echogenic liver with multiple hypoechoic lesions consistent with corresponding to findings on CT performed [**2137-10-18**].
Metastatic breast ca- s/p Gemzar [**2137-10-28**].
The patient was continued on neurontin and oxycontin for peripheral neuropathy.
Since the patient has a h/o pancreatitis with elevated TG, triglyceride was rechecked and was improved to 578 ([**6-30**] 1397)  The patient had normal amylase and lipase during this hospitalization.
