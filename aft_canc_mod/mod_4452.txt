Admission Date:  [**2178-3-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-3-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2120-6-13**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Codeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Headache/Confusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2178-3-12**]: Right craniotomy for brain mass   History of Present Illness: 57 yo F with a history of breast cancer, s/p lumpectomy and radiation in [**2174**] who developed new L sided dull headache 3 weeks ago.
She states that this was accompanied by left sided visual changes including some bright lights and shadows.
She denies any amorosis fugax or frank blindness but does state that the changes have been progressive and her depth proception is off.
She was initially evaluated by an opthalmologist 2 weeks ago who reported she did not have any problems specific to the eye itself.
She also reports confusion and difficulty concentrating while working (She works as a school teacher).
For these complaints she underwent an outpatient CT scan of her head earlier today which by report demonstrated a new R parietal lobe mass with slight midline shift.
She received 10 of decadron at the OSH and was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for acute workup given her midline shift.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
LEFT SIDED VISUAL FIELD CUT TO MIDLINE.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Extensive vasogenic edema with likely underlying intraparenchymal mass centered in right temporoparietal region causing leftward midline shift by 12 mm as well as effacement of sulci and lateral ventricle.
No evidence of transtentorial or uncal herniation at this time.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
Diffuse demineralized bone without focal lesion.
Large 3.2 x 4.6 x 3.5 cm lesion in the right parietal/posterior temporal lobes, with very extensive surrounding vasogenic edema, which is seen to extend into the right occipital lobe.
Areas of decreased diffusion in the periphery of the mass may relate to the cellularity.
However, there is a larger area of decreased diffusion anterosuperior to the lesion in the right parietal lobe, which may represent non-enhancing neoplastic infiltration/vascular infarction.
Dedicated MR angiogram can also be considered, to assess the intracranial vessels as well as the vessel supplying the tumor and exclude a more prominent vascular etiology if any.
Significant effacement of the right lateral ventricle, with leftward shift of midline structures and mass effect on the midbrain as described above.
One indeterminate liver lesion in segment VI/VII should be further assessed by MRI with eovist to exclude metastasis.
There is no other evidence of metastatic disease.
Unchanged blood products layering around the resection bed,1 cm leftward shift of normally midline structures, also unchanged, and decrease of the pneumocephalus within the surgical cavity compared to the post-surgical CT from [**2178-3-12**].
No new sites of intracranial hemorrhage, and no definite evidence of acute infarction.
Multiple foci of enhancement consistent with residual tumor, with the dominant focus of enhancement, posterior and medial to the resection cavity measuring 23 x 8 x 15 mm and extending into the subependymal region, involving the atrium of the right lateral ventricle.
Additional foci of residual tumor in close proximity to the surgical cavity and two "satellite" nodules superior to the surgical cavity, as on the presurgical MRI.
The restricted diffusion of the residual tumor and the subependymal extension of the residual tumor would favor primary CNS lymphoma or metastasis from breast or occult small cell cancer of the lung over underlying glial neoplasm, where slow diffusion is unusual.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 57F w/PMH significant for breast cancer.
On [**3-12**], she was taken to the OR for craniotomy and mass resection.
Her CT Torso also revealed several lesions within her liver.
Liver consult was obtained to further evaluate, and they recommended that the patient be followed up as an outpatient for these lesions.
Hydromorphone 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for severe pain.
You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.
-An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.
Loss of vision, either partial or total.
Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.
Severe sensitivity to light.
Severe headache or change in headache.
Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
New onset of seizure or change in seizure, or seizure from which you wake up confused.
Due to the complexity of neurosurgical procedures and treatment of neurosurgical problems, effective advice regarding emergency situations cannot be given over the telephone.
Should you have a situation which is not life-threatening, but you feel needs addressing before normal office hours or on the weekend, please present to the local emergency room, where the physician there will evaluate you and contact us if needed.
?Please return to the office in [**9-24**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your sutures and a wound check.
