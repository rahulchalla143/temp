No definite consolidations are seen.
There is platelike atelectasis at the left lung base.
No layering pleural effusions are seen.
* [**2116-7-24**] CT NECK W/ contrast: No abnormally enlarged nodes in the neck.
The areas of increased uptake noted on PET scan could correspond to the region of the tonsils, which appear unremarkable on the CT scan.
However, any interval change in their size could not be assessed due to lack of prior comparable studies.
* [**2116-7-17**] PET SCAN: Two new bilateral foci of increased FDG uptake in neck raising raising suspicion for recurrent FDG-avid lymphoma.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 39 yo female with history of T-cell NHL in remission with recent abnormal PET scan findings under further investigation, with fever, hypotension of 12-hour duration, responsive to IVF.
Although her presentation most suggestive of severe sepsis, with elevated lactate and hypotension responsive to IVF resuscitation, the rapid resolution was more consistent with an anaphylactic reaction to IV contrast from the CT.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] has reported a similar admission where the patient presented with a septic picture which subsequently resolved without localizing a source.
* 2) T-cell NHL in remission: Recent PET findings were concerning for disease recurrence, although CT neck without lymphadenopathy.
There were no active heme/onc issues during this admission.
* 3) ARF: Creatinine up to 1.4 on admission, decreased to normal, suspect pre-renal physiology given elevated specific gravity and improvement with hydration.
Disp:*12 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Likely anaphylactic reaction to contrast Secondary: T-cell lymphoma   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile.
