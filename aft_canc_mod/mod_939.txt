Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver without focal hepatic mass.
Two, tiny non-obstructing renal calculi within both kidneys.
Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
No intra-abdominal tumor identified.
No biliary ductal dilatation.
Marked distention of the IVC and hepatic veins consistent with right heart failure.
Stable appearance of the nondistended gallbladder with thickened wall, cholelithiasis, and adenomyomatosis.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
There is severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Hepatic veins and IVC are patent without evidence of thrombosis.
Marked distention of these vessels is considered most likely due to right heart failure.
Expected pneumobilia in the setting of recent ERCP.
Localized erythema of the mucosa was noted in the antrum and stomach body.
Two superficial erosions with overlying exudates and surrounding erythema were noted in the duodenal bulb.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was initally unsuccessful with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
Cholangiogram showed a single irregular stone in the distal CBD.
No proximal dilation was noted.
To help faciliate stone extraction, the sphincterotomy was gently extended in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
Although post sweep cholangiogram did not show evidence of residual stones, it is possible that some framgents may have been left behind.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 76 year old male w/CAD s/p CABG (EF 18%) who presented with 50 lb wt loss x 4 weeks and jaundice.
Prior to admission the patient had mild dull, intermittent, lower quadrant abdominal pain, anorexia, fatigue, and intermittent nausea with emesis (brown) for the prior 4 weeks.
Neither nausea or abdominal pain was related to food, and no ETOH or NSAID use recently.
When the patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] and was found to have elevated LFT's with bilirubin of 21.
Subsequently on the floor the patient became hypotensive with SBP's in the 80-90's (baseline 110's on valsartan, BB, imdur) which responded poorly to gentle fluid boluses and holding of his antihypertensives.
He also was noted to have a rising BUN and dropping HCT (45.4 on [**8-21**].8 on [**8-23**].2 on [**8-28**], and 30 s/p 1 unit RPBC's on [**8-29**]) with guaic positive stools and dark stools.
He also had an increased WBC from 3.2 on admission to 6.6.
Additionally, the patient had a mild amount of ascites on ultrasound but radiology did not feel that there was an adequate amount to tap.
He was admitted to the ICU for management of hypotension and ?GI bleed.
Repeat EGD did not show any evidence of active bleeding.
Housestaff and attendings had many conversations both with the patient and with his health care proxy, and decided given the patients underlying co-morbidities and preferences, that he be made DNR/DNI/CMO.
