Admission Date:  [**2107-12-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-12-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2038-11-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: lisinopril / Rituxan / Verapamil  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**] Chief Complaint: respiratory and renal failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation (done at OSH prior to transfer) Bronchoscopy Central Line Placement (RIJ) Extubation Central Line Removal   History of Present Illness: 69yo female h/o non-Hodgkin's lymphoma c/b vasculitis w/ cryoglobulinemia, previous dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 40% up to 70%) and chronic kidney disease transferred from an OSH one day post-op from lap cholecystectomy b/c of worsening oliguria and continued hypoxemia.
She presented to [**Hospital6 7472**] [**12-5**] w/ weakness, abdominal pain, and increased abdominal girth.
She had been discharged one day earlier after having findings c/w cholecystitis with plans for non-urgent cholecystectomy, plans to continue cholecystectomy.
On admission she had an episode of bradycardia thought due to a vasovagal episode, which resolved w/o intervention.
She had a newly elevated creatinine to 2.4, thought to be prerenal.
She was on the general medicine floor, with surgery following, and continued her antibiotics (switched to Augmentin/Flagyl), along with an aggressive bowel regimen b/c she had not had a bowel movement for a week.
[**12-11**] her respiratory status acutely worsened, and there was concern for acute congestive heart failure.
CXR showed bilateral infiltrates, and she was given lasix with little response.
A Swan was placed, showing CVP 8 w/ wedge 12 to 15, so patient volume resuscitated.
Patient at this point had no transaminitis, but did have ongoing RUQ pain, and repeat U/S c/w chronic cholecystitis.
HIDA scan showed no gall bladder uptake.
Post-op, her urine output and oxygenation worsened, so a vasculitis work-up was started, showing  RF>500 and low complement.
Given 80mg IV lasix prior to transfer with no improvement.
Per husband, had been having diffuse, worsening abdominal pain for several weeks prior to admission to [**Doctor Last Name **] Dickinsen.
Briefly this is a 69 year old female with history of Non-Hodgkins's Lymphoma c/b and unclear h/o of cutaneous vasculitis and cryoglobulinemia and chronic kidney disease, previous dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 40% up to 70%),who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU on [**2107-12-13**] one day post-op from lap cholecystectomy due to worsening oliguria and continued hypoxemia, patient was intubated prior to transfer.
In the MICU patient was found to be severely volume overloaded with minimal urine output, she did not have fevers or leukocytosis but had been transferred on high dose steroids (concern for vasculitides), Zosyn for antibiotics.
Patient had an initial concern for vasculitides, 1st bronch appeared to be bloody but upon second bronch and repeat imaging there was no signs of pulmonary hemorrhage.
Rheumatology saw the patient, as the patient was found to have elevated RF and decreased complement (which could be due to cryoglobulinemia).
Finally, Patient had a TTE done in the hospital, which showed preserved systolic function, mild MR. .
History per outpatient Hematologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 25237**]: Patient had history of marginal zone lymphoma treated with chemo several years ago.
She also had a history of cutaenous vasculitis 8 months ago and found to have polyclonal croglobulinemia with evidence of small amount of lymphone in marrow, she was given chem and developed HSV and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] where she went to [**Hospital1 2025**] and was treated.
She had a vasculitic rash on her lower extremities 3 weeks ago, there was no intervention and patient improved.
At about 2 weeks ago at OSH patient had a small amount of cryoglobullins and flow cytometry with a small number of NHL cells.
There was no previous history of hypocomplimentenemia.
Past Medical History: - Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed and treated [**2102**], complicated more recently by cutaneous vasculitis and cryoglobulinemia, followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 25237**] in [**Location (un) 61553**] - Renal biopsy in [**3-/2107**] at [**Hospital1 2025**] showing membranous profilerative glomerulonephritis consistent with cryoglobulinemia - Chronic kidney disease (stage [**Name (NI) 25509**], unclear baseline Cr) - Dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 40%), resolved on most recent echo; h/o admissions for gross volume overload - Hypertension - Anemia - myelodysplasia - cholecystitis, s/p cholecystectomy - total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy   Social History: Independent at baseline.

[**12-14**] Bronchial lavage: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
IMAGING [**12-14**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Large, symmetric bilateral pleural effusions with attenuation values consistent with simple fluid.
Opacities most suggestive of extensive bibasilar compressive atelectasis although the presence of infection is not excluded by this study.
Geographic ground-glass attenuation in the bilateral upper lobes which is nonspecific, though likely reflects pulmonary edema although hemorrhage could also be considered as the etiology.
Diffuse anasarca within the subcutaneous soft tissues.
Inspissated secretions in distal bronchiol segments in the right lower lobe.
Hyperdense liver which can be seen in iron deposition disease or amiodarone use.
Small nodular thyroid for which correlation with thyroid function testing and consideration of ultrasound is suggested when clinically appropriate.

Minimal ascites.
Brief Hospital Course: 69yo female w/ h/o non-Hodgkin's lymphoma c/b an unclear h/o cutaneous vasculitis and cryoglobulinemia and chronic kidney disease with [**3-/2107**] renal biopsy showing membranous profilerative glomerulonephritis consistent with cryoglobulinemia, transferred from an OSH with respiratory failure and acute on chronic renal failure.
Hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient arrived severely fluid overloaded, but with minimal urine output.
Infection seemed unlikely, as she had not had fevers or leukocytosis, though she had been on high-dose steroids.
Pulmonary hemorrhage was considered given the h/o vasculitis and hazy bilateral infiltrates.
Initial bronchoscopy showed some blood in the bronchi, so the patient received 24hrs of high-dose steroids.
However, repeat bronchoscopy showed a small amount of blood that cleared easily with lavage, making pulmonary hemorrhage less likely.
CT scan of the chest was also more consistent with fluid overload.
After call out from MICU she continued to have hypoxic episodes on the floor while sleeping with subjective paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
Per Xray, these may have been episodes of flash pulmonary edema.
Approximately 10L was removed during her hospital stay, and her respiratory function improved such that she was stable on 3L NC with no episodes of desaturation within 48 hours.
Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has a known history of MPGN per prior renal biopsy, presumably associated with her hemstologic malignancy, however the Nephrology team did not feel that her fluid overload could be attributed to this disease, but this may have contributed to her response to the aggressive hydration in the weeks prior to her transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
Urine sediment analysis revealed muddy brown casts consistent with ATN; this was thought to be due to vascular congestion / fluid overload.
Given concern for h/o cryglobulinemia/vasculitis, a panel of rheumatology labs revealed high inflammatory markers and low complement levels, rhematoid factor ~120, consistent with known cryoglobulinemia, but not consistent with a pulmonary/renal syndrome, and given muddy brown casts, Nephrology felt a nephritic/vasculitic picture less likely.
However, given her underlying renal disease, it is important she she continue follow-up with Nephrology.
Hematology was consulted and did not feel her overall picture or pancytopenia was consistent with active malignancy.
Most likely this was a result of severe illness.
Hypertension:  The patient has chronic refractory hypertension.
Initially antihypertensives were held because of concern for poor renal perfusion.
A renal ultrasound was performed and showed no sign of renal artery stenosis.
The Cardiology and Renal teams felt that her hypertension could be explained by fluid overload, and recommended reassessment once her fluid balance was corrected.
Echo showed new mitral regurgitation, but intact ventricular function.
There was no report of fever or suspected cholangitis from the OSH, so this was stopped one day after presentation.
Her incisions remained clean and intact, and she had no fever or sign of infection.

You were admitted to the hospital due to respiratory failure and renal failure after having your gallbladder removed.
During your ICU stay you were found to have excess fluid throughout your body.
You had several episodes of respiratory distress at night when it was difficult to breathe.
These were due to the excess fluid and did not continue as the fluid was removed.
This is most likely because of the excess fluid.
During one of your imaging studies (CT scan) it was noted that you had a small nodule on your thyroid.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] may want to have blood work to check your thyroid function, or an ultrasound of the thyroid.
You also were noted to have low blood counts of your white and red cells.
- START Maalox, Colace, Senna, and simethicone for dyspepsia and constipation.
