Admission Date:  [**2117-9-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-10-5**]   Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: aspirin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2117-9-29**] Aortic valve replacement with a 29-mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic Ultra bioprosthesis.
Replacement of ascending aorta with a 30-mm Dacron tube graft using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest which included hemi-arch replacement.
History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] year old male known to our service (see previous notes) who has a history of severe AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.8cm2), HTN, chronic GI bleeding ([**1-6**] AVMs, UC) requiring frequent transfusion, myelodysplastic syndrome s/p recent chemotherapy.
He first needed neuro clearance after new left foot drop.
Neuro decided foot drop is related to peroneal nerve lesion.
Given his complex GI history, he was also waiting GI clearance and to make sure that his colitis was in control and hopefully off steroids.
Following cardiac surgery, it was recommended that he have a colectomy because of the ulcerative colitis and a large polyp that is almost to the anal verge.
Past Medical History: - Severe aortic stenosis - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Systolic congestive heart failure - Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy - Ulcerative colitis with recurrent GI bleeding on sulfasalazine  - Gastric AVMs s/p GI bleed, admitted on [**2117-7-26**] to [**2117-7-28**] - Myelodysplastic syndrome, tx with Vidaza [**Date range (1) 32684**] - Prostate Cancer in [**2095**]'s - Left foot drop - common peroneal nerve lesion, likely at the fibular head.
Wears foot orthosis and foot drop splint.

No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
The patient is on no inotropes.
There is a well-seated, well-functioning bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No paravalvular leak is seen.
There is a mean gradient of 7 mmHg across the aortic valve at a cardiac index of 2.1.
Mitral regurgitation is trace.
Tricuspid regurgitation is unchanged.
His rhythym was initially asystole and then became nodal and eventually he was in a sinus rhythm in the 60's.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued (patient was in sinus rhythm in the 80's) after third dose of beta blocker without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD 6 the patient was ambulating with assistance, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
