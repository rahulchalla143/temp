He had two deep suctioned sputum cx growing out Aspergillus and yeast/mold.
ID was consulted and they felt culture results secondary to colonization.
He was transferred from SICU to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for continued medical management of COPD and frequent suctioning as patient has numerous episodes of desat/tach/HTN/tachynea.
#Respiratory failure: [**Last Name **] problem is a combination of his poor pulmonary status at baseline as well as VAP, in addition to an ongoing BOOP/pneumonitis.
This diagnosis is unclear as his consolidation has increased since being on steroid therapy.
Patient has positive sputum cultures for aspergillus but inconsistent CT and unlikely in the setting of only steroid induced immunosuppresion.
If patient spikes a fever or shows other signs of infection could consider thoracentesis as well but this would be risky given his low reserve of functional lung tissue.

Continue q1-2 hr frequent suctioning as frequent episodes of desaturation.
He has anemia of chronic disease.
