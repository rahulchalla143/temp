Admission Date:  [**2111-8-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2111-9-5**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3531**] Chief Complaint: esophageal stenting c/b post procedure aspiration/hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD with esophageal stent  History of Present Illness: 86 year-old female with a history of esophageal ca who was admitted from EGD suite after esophageal stent placement.
There was a question of possible aspiration during the procedure.
She became nauseous and vomited small amount bile and given 4mg zofran IV.
ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, chest pain, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, cough, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.
Past Medical History: A-fib (on amiodarone, not anti-coagulated) COPD (on albuterol prn) HTN Hyperlipidemia GERD h/o shingles 7 weeks prior s/p tonsillectomy   Social History: Lives in [**Hospital3 **] at Emerald Court.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: T:98.5 BP:156/75 HR:95 RR:25 O2Sat:93% 10L GEN: Elderly female, with mildly labored breathing.
HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, dry MM, OP Clear NECK: No JVD, no cervical lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: RRR, no M/G/R, normal S1 S2 PULM: coarse rhonchi diffusely, no wheezes ABD: Soft, NT, ND, +BS EXT: No C/C, trace edema Back: right side erythemtous maculopacuplar lesions following a dermatome, tender NEURO: alert, oriented to person, place, and time.
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
Dense left perihilar consolidation could be pneumonia, could also be radiation change, and mass.
Heart is moderately  enlarged whether due to cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion is indeterminate.
Large irregular opacity obscuring the apex of the aortic knob could be a pleural or lung mass or just atelectasis.
Small to moderate left pleural effusion is present.
CXR [**2111-8-25**]: Progression of the left lung consolidation with a new left-sided pleural effusion.
The appearences are again very likely secondary to aspiration.
CXR [**2111-8-26**]: Interval worsening of left upper and left lower lobe consolidation that might represent a combination of aspiration and atelectasis.
There is no pneumothorax.
CXR [**2111-8-28**]: There is improvement in the left upper lobe consolidation, with persistent left lower lobe consolidation and a new left sided pleural effusion with left lower lobe and lingular atelectasis.
CXR [**2111-8-28**]: No short interval change in appearance of the left lung, with findings likely representing a combination of consolidation and atelectasis combined with a moderate left pleural effusion.
Considering presence of volume loss, CT may be considered to exclude an obstructing process if warranted clinically.
Increasing interstitial opacities in right lung likely reflect asymmetric edema from fluid overload, and there is persistent right basilar atelectasis and adjacent small effusion, unchanged.
No pulmonary embolism.
Large bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with associated atelectasis.
Given cardiomegaly, these findings may represent congestive heart failure.
Small amount of secretions within the right lower lobe bronchus and layering of material within the lower esophageal wall stent.
Enlarged pulmonary artery suggestive of pulmonary hypertension.
However, please note, stent patency or stenosis cannot be directly assessed on this evaluation and a barium esophagram could be performed for further assessment as clinically indicated.
ECG [**2111-8-25**]: Sinus rhythm with a single ventricular premature beat.
Low limb lead voltage.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Poor R wave progression.
CXR [**2111-9-1**]: Large multiloculated left pleural effusion has changed in distribution but not in overall severity.
Left lower lobe is still collapsed.
Left upper lobe atelectasis has improved.
Small right pleural effusion is stable or slightly  increased.
Pulmonary vascular congestion persists, but I see no pulmonary edema.
Cardiac silhouette is obscured by adjacent pleural abnormality but is probably large though unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
[**2111-9-2**] VIDEO SWALLOW: IMPRESSION: Minimal penetration with thin consistency barium.
[**2111-9-3**] CT HEAD: INDINGS: There are diffuse hypodense areas in the bilateral frontal lobes and periventricular regions likely representing small vessel ischemic disease.
There are no masses.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect.
No bony lesions are noted.
No evidence for metastatic disease.
Mild small vessel ischemic disease.
FECAL CULTURE (Final [**2111-9-4**]):       NO ENTERIC GRAM NEGATIVE RODS FOUND.
NO SALMONELLA OR SHIGELLA FOUND.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 F with history of esophageal and squamous cell lung cancer, admitted for paliative esophageal stent placement complicated by aspiration pneumonia.
# shortness of breath - initially attributed to an aspiration pneumonia, this occured in the setting of esophageal stent placement.
She continued to have shortness of breath over the course of [**8-7**].
CTA revealed a large left pleural effusion.
She received IVF fluids on [**8-31**] for orthostasis and again on [**9-1**] for frank hypotension felt [**3-9**] dehydration.
In this setting, concern was raised for volume overload.
Her dyspnea was not markedly changed with lasix, and her atrial fibrillation and hyponatremia worsened.
The effusion is new as it was not present on prior CXR on [**2111-8-14**] with her oncologist.
After discussion with her oncologist ([**Last Name (un) 82949**] Anamur, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 82950**]), this effusion was felt to be malignant (her lung ca is located in the LUL and had improved s/p XRT), and felt likely to reaccumulate.
Her prognosis was felt to be poor given 2 primary malignancies, and her inability to tolerate chemotherapy.
She was treated with oral ativan and morphine for respiratory comfort.
She may receive lasix prn dyspnea, however these efforts have been limited by tachycardia and hypotension during this hospitalization.
# dizziness - pt complained of dizziness after starting antibiotics.
head CT was unremarkable for metastasis.
she demonstrated no nystagmus or evidence of BPPV.
her dizziness was attributed to orthostasis and medication.
# diarrhea - likely [**3-9**] antibiotics, and improving at the time of discharge.
she had stool cultures x3 negative for cdiff, and general stool culture negative on [**9-2**].
She had intermittent episodes of breakthrough RVR in 120-130s in the icu thought likely due to underlying aspiration PNA and hypoxia.
She remained asymptomatic with the RVR, diltiazem regimen was titrated up and metoprolol was added to acheive better rate control.
She did develop pleural effusions in this setting requiring intermittent diuresis, as above.
She is being discharged to hospice on her regimen of metoprolol, diltiazem, and amiodarone for comfort, as she becomes anxious when she senses a rapid heart rate.
Esophageal + Lung Ca: pt with 2 primary malignancies, including T3N1 esophageal  adenocarcinoma, with squamous cell lung cancer s/p XRT, both diagnosed in [**2110**].
As above, she is being discharged to hospice given large left pleural effusion and ongoing dyspnea  #.
Her pain was controlled with tylenol.
She subsequently was treated with IVF for hypotension felt likely [**3-9**] dehydration and poor po intake.
she is being discharged to hospice with comfort measures only, and understands no further role for hospitalization as she is not interested in thoracentesis or further surgical procedures to treat her malignancy, and is not a chemotherapy candidate.

Esophageal cancer, s/p stent placement Squamous cell lung cancer Malignant pleural effusion Atrial fibrilation with rapid ventricular response  Secondary: Hypertension COPD Depression Post herpetic neuralgia Hyperlipidemia GERD   Discharge Condition: Stable vital signs, breathing on 2-3L nasal cannula.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for aspiration pneumonia after an esophageal stent placement.
You were also evaluated for safe swallowing and determined that you should eat and drink.
You were found to have a large fluid collection on the left lung, which is most likely related to your cancer.
As we discussed, you are not a candidate for chemotherapy, and have chosen not to have further surgical procedures to drain this fluid as it is likely to reaccumulate.
