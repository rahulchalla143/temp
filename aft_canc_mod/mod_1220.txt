Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC placement   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 4401**] is a 74 year-old male with PAF off anticoagulation, and recently diagnosed extensive stage small cell lung cancer status post Y stent tracheal placement for obstruction, status post Carboplatin/Etoposide chemotherapy on [**2105-8-11**], who presented from the ED with febrile neutropenia and AF with RVR.
His Coumadin was discontinued after finding encroachment of his mass on his pulmonary artery.
* He now presented with a 1-week history of progressive cough, and increased sputum production, which he describes as whitish.
In the ICU, the patient also complained of moderately severe "throat pain", which he has had for about a month, worsening, with associated hoarseness as well as odynophagia with both solids and liquids.
No clear dysphagia.
No hemoptysis.
He reports some RS pain with coughing, no other chest pain.
No increase in SOB.
No lower extremity swelling.
+ Chills at home.
Family History: Son died of brain tumor at age 16.
LUNGS: Decreased BS on R over mid-lung field, also dull to percussion.
Mild wheezes, no rhales or rhonchi heard.
Normal S1S2 NO M/R/G ABD: soft, NT/ND, no HSM.
BACK: No spinal tenderness, no CVAT.
Imaging: Swallowing study: IMPRESSION: 1) No penetration or aspiration.
CXR: IMPRESSION: Decreased size of the right hilar mass since the prior study.
No infiltrate.
No pulmonary embolism.
Decrease in size of large dominant right hilar mass.
New tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacity of the peripheral right upper and middle lobes is nonspecific but may be infectious, inflammatory, or possibly represent lymphangitic spread of tumor.
New small areas of posterobasilar consolidation at both lung bases may be due to atelectasis but could represent infection.
ECHO [**2105-8-26**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2105-4-17**], the focal thickening of the aortic leaflets is slightly more pronounced, but no aortic regurgitation is identified.
If the clinical suspicion for endocarditis is moderate or high, a TEE may be better able to define the aortic valve morphology and to evaluate for possible vegetations.
Colonoscopy [**2105-9-1**]:Pt with multiple polyps that were removed and sent for pathology.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 74 year-old male with extensive stage SCLC with tracheal obstruction status post tracheal stent, status post first cycle of chemotherapy [**2105-8-11**], with febrile neutropenia, AF with RVR now improved.
Strep bovis baceremia with Hx of Febrile neutropenia: On admission patient was found to have febrile neutropenia.
As such, the patient was pancultured and found to have 1/4 bottles positive for Strep bovis.
Given previous history thickened aortic valve and aortic valve vegetation, the patient was diagnosed with presumed bacterial endocarditis.
Additionally, patient received colonoscopy given suspicious nature of strep bovis bacteremia for colonic lesions.
Neutropenia did resolve as patient had gotten neulasta.
Tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacity CT findings: CT chest showed findings that could represent fungal or mycobacterial.
However, patient had multiple induced sputum samples as well as fungal blood tests that were all negative.
Odynophagia/cough:  Concomitant hoarseness could be secondary to recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement of neoplasm versus related to odynophagia.
Improved with symptomatic treatment and decreased coughing as odynophagia is likely due to persistent coughing that is secondary to lung cancer.
Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: Initially patient had elevated heart rate and was evaluated in ICU.
He was kept on telemetry for duration of hospitalization but did not have elevated heart rate in days prior to discharge.
Not on anticoagulation at present given mass encroachment on pulmonary vessels.
Oral Herpes: pt with small lesion on left lip.
This is new and pt has a history of previous lip sores.
Anemia : Anemic (although hematocrit low at baseline), Suspect secondary to recent chemotherapy.
- Colonoscopy shows multiple polypoid lesions, likely cause of bleeding.
Pt received multiple transfusions with goal hct of 30 while in pre-chemotherapy status.
No need for protonix.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for Insomnia.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
Dextromethorphan-Guaifenesin 10-100 mg/5 mL Syrup Sig: Five (5) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for coughing.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for nausea, anxiety.
