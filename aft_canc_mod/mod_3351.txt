She was seen by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] in clinic on [**6-23**] after an MRI on [**6-22**] showed worsening of her left frontal and left cerebellar lesions in the interval from her last MRI which was done in [**2166-12-24**].
She reported 3 days of progressive left sided weakness prior to that visit.
On [**6-24**] she developed what was described by OSH reports as expressive aphasia and left facial droop which were not noted in Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 73943**] note from [**6-23**].
On arrival she was evaluated by the ED who found that she also had a guaiac positive rectal exam.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  (from OMR) - [**1-26**] 0.47-mm thick, [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level II melanoma resected from right shoulder lesion during her second pregnancy, then observed - [**2162**] developed a forehead nodule and a biopsy in [**2163-8-24**] revealing melanoma.
PET/CT scan revealed uptake in the right frontal bone, a 2 cm soft tissue mass near the  ascending colon and in the right tibia - Cyberknife radiosurgery to the skull lesion on [**2163-10-11**], followed by high-dose IL-2 therapy that was started on [**2163-11-14**].
A follow up PET/CT at week 11 revealed interval increase in size of the right tibial lesion, but no FDG avidity in the right frontal bone or ascending colon soft tissue mass.
Follow up tibial MRI showed increased enhancement while PET scan  was stable in that area.
- right tibial metastasis resected by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4223**], M.D.
- [**9-/2164**], she developed forgetfulness and frontal headaches.
Outpatient head MRI on [**2164-10-18**] showed a large right frontal heterogeneously enhancing mass suggestive of a metastasis.
She then had a left parietal craniotomy for resection of hemorrhagic  tumor by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] on [**2165-12-23**], followed by more Cyberknife radisurgery to a left cerebellar to 2200 cGy at 79% isodose line on [**2165-12-25**], and  another Cyberknife radiosurgery to a left medial frontal metastasis on [**2166-4-15**] to 2,200 cGy at 75% isodose line.
PET scan on [**2166-5-19**] revealed increased FDG avidity in the right tibia and in the posterior stomach felt c/w recurrent disease.
- She began compassionate-use ipilimumab on [**2166-6-25**] with worsening right LE pain noted.
Lives with her husband who is her HCP.
On Hospice   Family History: Mother had pancreatic cancer and diabetes at 63.
Her grandmother's brother died of melanoma and her great grandmother died of colon cancer.
Visual fields are difficult to assess given patient cooperation III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements intact bilaterally without nystagmus when prompted, has a left gaze neglect.
No abnormal movements or tremors.
LUE 4+, RUE grip 5-, [**Hospital1 **] and tri [**3-28**], LLE 4+ throughout, RLE IP 4, Q/H/Gas/AT/[**Last Name (un) 938**] [**3-28**], No pronator drift.
With much prompting and discussion moves left side well  Sensation: Decreased on left upper and lower extremities likely secondary to neglect.
On right side is Intact to light touch  Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger with right upper extremity, does not complete on left side  Discharge exam: Gen; pleasant and cooperative neuro: AOX3 PERRL, EOM intact, face symmetric, motor [**5-28**] except for LLE secondary to known osteosarcoma, sensory intact to light tough, no clonus skin: incision intact, clean and dry with absorbable monocryl sutures in place.
Marked interval increase in size of the left frontal contrast-enhancing lesion, with an even larger interval increase in surrounding vasogenic edema in the bilateral frontal lobes, which now causes subfalcine herniation with 9-mm rightward shift of midline structures, as well as further effacement of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
Minimal increase in size and comparatively larger interval increase in surrounding vasogenic edema seen at the left cerebellar enhancing lesion.
No new lesions detected.
MRI Brain [**2168-7-7**] No significant changes are identified since the most recent examination, unchanged left frontal heterogeneous enhancing lesion, similar pattern of enhancement surrounding the right frontal surgical cavity with ex vacuo dilatation of the ventricular frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
No new lesions are identified since the most recent exam.
Expected postoperative findings of pneumocephalus, a small amount of blood products, and cytotoxic edema is present.
Stable appearance of prior resections in the left parietal and right frontal lobes.
Tiny regions of nodular dural thickening with mild enhancement.
Brief Hospital Course: 47 y/o F with L frontal metastatic lesion with L neglect, R arm weakness and dysarthria presents for elective tumor resection.
She was taken to the OR on [**7-7**] with no complications.
