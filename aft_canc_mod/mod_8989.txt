Mr [**Known lastname 3389**] came to clinic with symptoms of fever, rash over his chest and back, sore throat and mouth sores.
He states that he also couldn't tolerate being in the same house as a cat last night (so stayed in a hotel) due to allergy symptoms, but that he has never previously had an allergy to cats.
He has recently taken 2 weeks of levofloxacin followed by Zosyn from [**Date range (1) 79037**] for empiric coverage of a L side effusion that is now thought to be malignant.
ROS on admission: as above with the addition of urinary frequency.
Past Medical History: Past Onc History: Metastatic bladder cancer: Diagnosed in [**12/2127**] (presented with hematuria/clots - bladder mass revealed on CT).
Biopsy showed papillary urothelial cancer with invasion of the lamina propria.
On [**2128-3-12**], he had a partial cystectomy, which revealed high-grade urothelial carcinoma that was 4.5 cm described as PT3B with invasion into the perivesical tissue and associated with extravascular mass.
He then developed metastasis to his small bowel.
He recently was considered for a trial, but due to risk of interaction with his psychiatric medications, has elected to pursue single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] therapy-- Cycle 1 Day 1 of Taxotere was administered on [**2129-3-3**].
Past Medical History: Diverting Ileostomy [**2128-11-19**] recurrent SBO [**1-21**] metastatic disease HIV- CD4 612/ VL: undetectable as of [**9-24**] Metastatic Bladder CA (as above) Bipolar - hospitalization in [**2125**] at [**Hospital1 **] for psychosis h/o MRSA infection GERD h/o herpes simplex hypogonadism recent pna   Social History: Occasional ETOH [**1-22**] drinks/wk, denies h/o abuse h/o Heroin, Meth, Marijuana Smoking 1 pack/day.
nonblanching erythema over R hand.
PA & LATERAL RADIOGRAPHS CHEST (3 IMAGES): Large left pleural effusion has increased slightly in size.
There is persistent left mid lung atelectasis or scarring.
Retrocardiac opacification persists and may be due to atelectasis or consolidation.
IMPRESSION: Slight increase in large left pleural effusion.
Persistent retrocardiac opacification is concerning for consolidation and/or atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 48yo man with HIV (CD4 [**9-24**] = 612,VL undetectable), large l pleural effusion (likely malignant) admmitted with fever and neutropenia.
#) Fever and Neutropenia- The patient presented with neutropenia due to taxotere [**3-4**].
He was treated with aztreonam (cephalosporins avoided due to recent severe drug rash from zosyn) and vancomycin.
A diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis was performed on [**3-14**]; cytology was negative for malignant cells but cultures grew viridans Strep, micrococcus, and stomatococcus.
#) Rash- The patient presented with a severe drug rash (erythema, puritic, pustular over torso and hands) on admission which was thought to be due to Zosyn.
The patient had been on ZOsyn during his previous admission for empiric coverage of his pleural effusion; the medication was discontinued on the day prior to this admission at which point the patient had started to develop a mild rash.
#) Mucositis- the patient presented with severe mucocytis; he developed oral [**Female First Name (un) **] on [**3-13**].
Supportive care including mouth care, pain control, nystatin swish and swallow and systemic diflucan (started [**3-13**]) were given with improvement.
#) Pleural effusion- The patient has a large L pleural effusion.
Subsequently, there was significant bleeding into the L hemithorax requiring 16 units of PRBCs and 2 units FFP.
The L hemithorax remains opacified on CXR, likely a combination of clotted blood and effect of pleurodesis; the Pleurex catheter drains only small amounts of fluid, but as the clotted blood degrades, more fluid may be drainable via the Pleurex.
He is comfortable on room air but requires supplemental oxygen at night, which is best provided with humidification because of his sensitive mucus membranes and recent mucositis.
H/o thrush in past, no other OI.
Recent CD4 check low at 80, however, this was checked during acute illness s/p steroids and chemo so thought to be spurious value per ID consult last admit.
#)Metastatic bladder cancer: s/p taxotere [**3-4**].
#) Psych: The patient has a history of bipolar disorder, most recent episode depression.
#) H/o small bowel obstruction s/p ileostomy: Has had problems with [**Name2 (NI) 109691**] bleeding around the ileostomy, which may be due to irritation with dressing changes.
#) blepharitis: crusting on eyelids and around eye lashes as well as ectropion; started blephamide eye drops after consultation with ophthalmology with good result.
