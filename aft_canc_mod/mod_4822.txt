Moderately air-filled colonic segments seen in the right upper quadrant.
No evidence of free subdiaphragmatic air.
No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
Normal size of the cardiac silhouette without evidence of pulmonary edema.

There was no visible vessel to clip.
There was no active bleeding.
Impression: At the distal post-polypectomy site there was an overlying eschar suggestive of recent bleeding.
There was no visible vessel to clip.
There was no active bleeding.
He required a total of 5 units of PRBCs for his bleeding and anemia.
He underwent coloscopy by GI who saw the site of polypectomy but no active bleeding.
During the procedure, he had an episode of hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the 60s, and then developed a brief rash which resolved over the next couple of hours.
This may have been due to the Fentanyl and Versed that he received for the colonoscopy.
He received normal saline boluses and blood for his hypotension and this resolved.
If you have any further episodes of bleeding from your rectum, dark or black stools, lightheadedness, weakness, dizziness or other symptoms that concern you, you should go to an emergency room immediately.
