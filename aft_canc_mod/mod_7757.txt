Admission Date:  [**2134-1-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2134-1-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-2-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29226**] Chief Complaint: weakness, shortness of breath   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2134-1-23**] - Left radial A-line placement  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 77yo male with COPD, morbid opesity, OSA, DM2 who has a recent diagnosis of Stage IIIB T2bN3Mx lung adenocarcinoma (last dose of chemo on [**1-21**]) who presents with shortness of breath, hypoxia, and hypotension.
He went to bed and awoke this morning with increasing frequency of diarrhea, leg weakness and an overall feeling of malaise with nausea.
He then became hypotensive to the 70s so he was given IV fluids (2L NS total) and started on phenylephrine gtt.
He denied chest pain, abdominal pain, or leg pain.
Denies hematuria and was guaiac negative.
CXR demonstrated known RLL consolidation, mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small right-sided pleural effusion.
CT head w/o contrast did not demonstrate any acute process.
Given elevated troponin and concern for PE, he was started on a heparin gtt.
ECHO in the ED did not demonstrate any new LV wall motion abnormality but showed focal RV apical hypokinesis with preserved EF.
The patient was without any acute complaints.
Reports some shortness of breath and diarrhea.

[**2134-1-22**] 2D-ECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is stenosis of the main pulmonary artery.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2134-1-22**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST - No evidence of mass or mass effect in the brain, however, evaluation of the mass is limited due to lack of IV contrast.
Evidence of old ischemic injury in the right frontal and left parietal lobes.
Bilateral basal ganglia lacunes.
[**2134-1-22**] VENOUS B/L LOWER EXTREMITY DUPLEX ??????
No evidence of DVT, although neither left peroneal vein and only one right peroneal vein were imaged.
There is opacity at right and left bases, with small bilateral effusions, unchanged.
Upper zone redistribution and mild pulmonary vascular plethora is present, but is likely accentuated by low lung volumes.
Brief Hospital Course: IMPRESSION: 77M with a PMH significant for COPD, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus type 2 and recent diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma (stage IIIB, T2b N3 MX, last dose of carboplatin and taxol on [**2134-1-21**]) admitted with hypoxia and hypotension, found to have an elevated D-dimer and cardiac biomarker elevation with concern for acute pulmonary embolization.
# ACUTE HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE - Patient presented with desaturation to the 70s requiring NRB for oxygenation support.
In the ED, EKG demonstrating S1-Q3-T3 pattern, D-dimer markedly elevation with cardiac biomarker elevation (peak 1.59, CK-MB 30) and 2D-Echo demonstrating focal hypokinesis of the right ventricule with preserved LVEF.
Given his malignancy history, pulmonary embolus was a considerable concern.
If large enough, an embolus would explain his hypoxia and increased oxygen requirement, cause atrial stretch resulting in BNP elevation and certainly could have induced right ventricular myocardial damage inciting a Troponin elevation.
A CXR showed some opacification at the right and left lung base which could represent early consolidation given his immunecompromise and healthcare exposure.
ACS/MI was considered but deemed less likely given his reassuring EKG and no strong evidence of cardiac history, despite his cardiac biomarker elevation.
An acute component of COPD exacerbation and untreated obesity-hypoventilation syndrome is also likely given his hypercarbia.
Of note, his ABG demonstrated 7.30/60/69 with an A-a gradient of 7 - in the setting of his known obstructive sleep apnea, obesity and COPD history.
His acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure likely reflects his COPD history and untreated OSA.
Overall, with heparinization for his suspected pulmonary embolus and treatment of pneumonia with broad spectrum antibiotics as well as steroids for a component of COPD, his pulmonary status improved and we weaned his supplemental oxygen needs.
# HYPOTENSION - Presented with SBP to the 80s in the ED with Neosynephrine gtt started.
Concern for shock given acute renal insufficiency in the setting of hypotension and respiratory failure.
Hypovolemia (in the setting of poor PO intake and recent GI losses with poor forward perfusion) was considered vs. cardiogenic shock (given cardiac biomarker elevation) vs. sepsis or distributive shock.
Given concern for pulmonary embolus with RV hypokinesis and biomarker elevation with elevated BNP, a cardiogenic component was a strong initial concern, but his cardiac status remained stable.
He had no ischemic changes noted on EKG.
He was started on Levophed given persistent hypotension.
# TACHYCARDIA ??????
Evidence of sinus tachycardia to a rate of 127, normal axis, qIII, TWI III, no ST depressions/elevations noted on admission EKG.
Telemetry review notes a differential that includes sinus tachycardia, multifocal atrial tachycardia incited by a component of hypoxia and possible supraventricular tachycardia or atrial tachycardia.
His tachycardia improved with hepariniztion, antibiosis and steroid treatments.
Cardiology re-evaluated the pt on the floor due to persistent tachycardia and once again decided that he did not need to be rate controlled.
His EKG showed frequent PACs and not atrial fibrillation.
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY - Baseline creatinine in the 1.3 range with acute elevation to 3.0 on admission.
No hematuria or dysuria with reassuring U/A.
Urine lytes revealed FeNa 1.6% on admission (FeUrea of 29.34%) with concern for mixed intra-renal vs. pre-renal etiology and poor forward perfusion in the setting of hypovolemia, GI losses and volume depletion and evidence of shock physiology.
# LOOSE STOOLS - Chemotherapy-related loose stools are possible, but have not been noted at prior infusions.
No recent medication changes or antibiotic requirements.
Viral gastroenteritis is certainly possible.
No evidence of bloody diarrhea.
# OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA - Patient with diagnosis of OSA but does not tolerate CPAP at home.
ABG on admission demonstrated hypercarbia with acidemia, with suspected underlying hypoventilation with suspected baseline hypercarbia with compensation.
# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS - [**Name (NI) **] wife said patient not at baseline since following his chemotherapy on [**2134-1-21**].
CT head negative for intracranial acute process.
Strong clinical suspicion for hypoxia as an etiology.
No evidence of neutropenia at this times.
Discussed with outpatient Oncologist and chemotherapy remained on hold given his acute clinical needs.
No evidence of neutropenia this admission with stable cell counts.
# DIABETES MELLITUS, TYPE 2 - Patient on glimeperide at home without insulin requirement.
# HYPERTENSION - On Lisinopril, HCTZ per home medication dosing; will hold anti-hypertensives in the setting of hypotension and renal failure.
