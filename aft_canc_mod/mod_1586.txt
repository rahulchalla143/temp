Brief Hospital Course: 76 year-old woman with ESRD, CHF (EF 30-40%), was initially admitted with LGIB to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
1st attempt at bowel prep resulted in pulmonary edema after 1L golytely.
She underwent colonoscopy which showed diverticulosis, but no blood.
It was suspected that her episode of bleeding was likely due to a diverticular bleed.
# Anemia [**3-16**] acute blood loss from LGIB: patient recieved 4 units of PRBC transfusion.
# ESRD: patient continued HD, and required dialysis for management of acute CHF.
# Systolic CHF, EF 30-40% Pt developed pulmonary edema from Golytely prep during the admission, for which she received dialysis.
On [**1-18**], she felt somewhat short of breath and had pulmonary rales on exam.
# CAD, native vessel: Her Aspirin and plavix were initially held due to her GI bleeding.
Her HCT appeared stable, without any evidence of ongoing bleed, so she was resumed on her aspirin 81 mg po q day on [**1-18**].
# Diabetes type II, controlled: continued insulin sliding scale  # Gout, chronic: continued allopurinol  # Sarcoidosis: No active issues.
