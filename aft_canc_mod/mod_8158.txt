Her past medical history is also significant for coronary artery disease with stents placed in [**2116**], congestive heart failure, and stage III chronic kidney disease.
Ms [**Known lastname **] presents today after 2 episodes of melena at [**Hospital 7137**].
This morning she had crampy abdominal pain lasting minutes throughout her abdomen with rectal urgency.
She passed 2 bowel movements and the pain subsided.
Her nurse noted the stool to be black although Ms [**Known lastname **] states the stool is always black because of her ferrous supplements.
No diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or hematemesis.
No fevers, chills, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, chest pain, chest pressure, or dizziness.
She was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital3 **] on [**3-25**] for an exacerbation of congestive heart failure, during which time a pleural effusion was tapped; thoracentesis revealed a transudate with negative cytology.
Renal ultrasound revealed a left renal hilum mass measuring 10.3 x 4.6 x 4.9 cm as well as lesions in the liver and pancreas.
A CT contrast to evaluate these further could not be performed because of her acute kidney injury.
She has not had any prior episodes of melena or hematochezia.
No hematemesis history.
Past Medical History: 1. diabetes 2. congestive heart failure 3. hyperlipidemia 4. hypertension 5. type II diabetes 6.
GAVE 7. coronary artery disease s/p 2 stents - [**2116**] in circumflex, and LAD 8. aortic stenosis s/p AVR (bioprosthetic) 9. stage III CKD 10. hx of CVA   Social History: She lives in [**Hospital1 **] with her younger sister.
Systolic ejection murmur is heard best in aortic area.
Respiratory rate is 18 with no significant accessory muscle use.
Cardiovascular exam shows no appreciable JVP, pulses 2+ and equal bilaterally, with a systolic ejection murmur without clicks loudest in aortic area.
Pulmonary exam reveals mild crackles at bases bilaterally, free of wheezes, with respiratory rate of 18.
Abdominal exam shows a distended, tympanic abdomen, with no appreciable masses or tenderness.
Extremities are quite swollen, with 3+ pitting edema to the thighs bilaterally.
No cyanosis, warm fingers and toes.
Splenomegaly and extensive lymphadenopathy involving the root of the mesentery, retroperitoneum, pelvis, and inguinal areas most consistent with lymphoma or lymphoproliferative disease.
Evaluation for liver and kidney mass is limited due to lack of IV contrast.
11-mm hepatic hypodensity is a nonspecific finding.
If prior imaging from outside hospital is made available, a direct comparison can be made.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and left basilar atelectasis.
Low volume ascites.
There is some obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, which may be due to a left pleural effusion with atelectasis.
No large right pleural effusion is seen, although a small one would be difficult to exclude.
LENI - IMPRESSION: No DVT in the right or left lower extremity.
[**2132-4-23**] Echo The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 7mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
Mild to moderate ([**12-17**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric right and left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Well-seated aortic valve bioprosthesis with higher-than-expected gradients.
Mild functional mitral stenosis from annular calcification.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy as described above.
Moderate left-sided pleural effusion.
Left lower lobe ground glass opacities which could be infectious or atelectasis due to poor inspiratory effort.
Left inguinal node biopsy Lymph node, left inguinal, biopsies (A-C):  Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma (See note).
Note:  The lymph node sections show areas of effacement of normal architecture by medium to large lymphoid cells, with abundant cytoplasm, oval to round nuclei with irregular nuclear membrane, vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli.
There are focal areas of nodularity seen.
CD10 shows stroma staining and is positive within residual follicles.
The above findings of focal nodular areas and higher grade diffuse areas with large B-cell suggests that this is large B-cell lymphoma arising from either marginal zone lymphoma (CD10 and CD5 negative) or CD10 negative follicular lymphoma.
ADDENDUM:  This may be consistent with a large B-cell lymphoma associated with the elderly.
[**Last Name (un) **] highlights several large cells positively hybridized.
INTERPRETATION   Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by: Lambda light chain restricted B-cell lymphoma.

Significance of her GI bleed was unclear as her stools have always been dark due to ferrous supplementation.
She has known GAVE which is likely source of her GI bleed.
She remained hemodynamically stable with no BMs while in ICU.
Her stools were guiaic negative and did not have BRBPR or melena.
No other source of bleed was identified.
# acute diastolic congestive heart failure: Pt had frequent hospitalizations for CHF exacerbation, most recently at [**Hospital3 10959**] in early [**Month (only) 547**].
She appeared volume overloaded and BNP was elevated.
As there was concern for GI bleed and need for transfusion, she was admitted to the ICU.
#  Lymphoma: During her recent hospitalization at OSH, a renal ultrasound revealed a left renal hilum mass measuring 10.3 x 4.6 x 4.9 cm as well as lesions in the liver and pancreas.
A CT contrast to evaluate these further could not be performed because of her acute kidney injury at that time.
The patient underwent inguinal LN biopsy that revealed diffuse b-cell lymphoma.
It was determined that pt was not currently symptomatic from her disease burden.
Her ldh and uric acid were elevated, but she has history of hyperuricemia documented as outpt.
potassium and renal function remained stable, and it was determined that she did not have tumor lysis syndrome.
# Stage III CKD - Creatinine was initially elevated above baseline but improved over the course of her hospital stay.
Labetalol and amlodipine were initially held given concern for GI bleed.
8. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure diffuse large b-cell lymphoma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were monitored carefully in the intensive care unit and had no further bleeding.
On the cardiology service it was noted that you had too much fluid on your body.
Additionally, a CT scan of your abdomen showed enlarged lymph nodes.
We consulted the hematology/oncology department and it was determined that your cancer is not causing any of your current symptoms and can be treated as an outpatient.
