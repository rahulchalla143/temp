Initially, differential diagnosis included septic vs. hypovolemic.
Her ICU course by systems was as follows:  1) ID:  Pt had a fever to 39C intraoperatively but was afebrile for the remainder of her admission.
All cultures including blood, line, sputum, and urine had no growth.
CT done revealed SBO, no abscess.
She required pressors until POD#1 then maintained BP without medications.
Cardiogenic shock was ruled out by three sets of enzymes and unchanged EKG.
Septic shock ruled out by negative cultures and afebrile as above.
Patient continued to be in atrial fibrillation throughout her stay.
Although pt was tachycardic on POD#0, this resolved after resuscitation.
After this, patient had evidence of bleeding into JP drains, from IVs, and hematuria.
Heparin gtt was held given concerns for bleeding but coumadin was continued.
Heparin gtt restarted POD#4 and again discontinued POD#5 after clinical bleeding per vagina and JP drains.
Her INR plateaued at 1.5 but Coumadin was not increased due to concern for high risk of bleed.
2) Neurology: On POD#5, pt was disoriented with slurred speech.
The leading diagnosis was delirium associated with postoperative course.
An MRI and CT scan showed no evidence of intracranial bleeding or acute CVA.
Evidence of known old infarct was seen.
4) GI: patient developed evidence of ileus between POD#5 and POD#7.
She had nausea/vomiting; CT abdomen revealed dilated loops of bowel c/w partial SBO vs. ileus.
On POD 9 she underwent CT scan of abdomen due to elevated WBC count - CT revealed complete SBO at level of ostomy.
Fractional excretion of urea was c/w prerenal disease.
There were no urinary eosinophils to suggest intrinsic disease.
6) Endo: TSH was evaluated during evaluation of mental status changes.
Gen [**Doctor First Name **] (from POD 9):  CT showed SBO - patient was made NPO, NGT & foley placed for decompression, IVFs and TPN started, patient monitored with serial exams.
Initial subjective and clinical improvement was seen as patient was afebrile and WBC decreased.
However, POD 12 patient spiked fever and WBC increased.
High output still from NGT, increasing drainage and erythema.
repeat CT scan showed perwistent SBO, no abcess collection.
Because of persistent obsturction and no improvement, patient was taken to the OR on POD 15 for exploratory laparotomy, resitting of ileosotmy, lysis of adhesions, resection of small intestine, closure of enterotomys x2 and closure of abdomen with vicryl mesh and VAC.
POD [**3-16**] - pt still intubated, but awake and alert; Vac had draingage sent for labs b/c of possible fistula formation.
POD 5 - enterocutaneous fistulas from open ab wound diagnosed; VAC changed; bowel function returned with good osteomy output.
VRE grew from abd mesh - Linazolid started.
POD 6 transferred to floor, but POD 7 transferred back to ICU - had increasing SOB/tachy; controlled with meds/nebs, had thoracentesis.
Patient continued to have low grade fevers without a source.
POD25 - all antibiotics were dc'd; latest urince culture was contamination, no growth.
POD 40 - patient had some bleeding from the left superior portion of the wound, asymptomatic.
since [**7-19**]  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Crohn's disease, enterocutaneous fistulae, endometrial cancer status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, prior cerebrovascular accident, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia, history of total colectomy, ileostomy, asthma  Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Patient to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility and to have daily wound care with dressing changes once a day to keep fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, chest pain, redness or drainage about the wounds, or if there are any questions or concerns.
