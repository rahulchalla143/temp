Admission Date:  [**2119-4-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2119-5-11**]  Date of Birth:   [**2041-2-10**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old woman with a history non-small-cell lung cancer status post chemotherapy and radiation therapy who presented now with a large right parietal occipital lesions and question of brain metastases.
Non-small-cell lung cancer with rib and bone metastases.
Preoperative diagnosis was metastatic lesion.
At the time of surgery it was discovered that the patient had a dural arteriovenous malformation with large varices.
She had no drift.
She did continue to have a left field cut that she had preoperatively; more left inferior quadrant than superior quadrant.
She was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] for an arteriogram to assess for residual arteriovenous malformation or arteriovenous fistula.
The patient was taken to the angiogram suite on [**2119-5-10**] where she underwent a diagnostic arteriogram which did not show evidence of remaining arteriovenous fistula but an aneurysm was detected  that was not diagnosed prior to this arteriogram.
She was alert, awake, and oriented times three with some intermittent periods of confusion; most likely related to sedation for angiogram and slight dehydration.
