RUQ U/S ([**2127-9-18**]): IMPRESSION: Large stone impacted in the gallbladder neck with appearance of the gallbladder highly suggestive of cholecystitis.
T cells express mature lineage antigens and have a normal helper cytotoxic ratio of 1.3 (usual range in blood 0.7-3.0).
Cell marker analysis demonstrates two large distinct populations of abnormal cells.
INTERPRETATION: Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by acute leukemia of myelomonocytic differentiation.
CT ABD/PELV ([**2127-9-19**]): IMPRESSION: 1) Acute cholecystitis with multiple small abscesses in the gallbladder fossa as well as extending into the hepatic parenchyma consistent with a contained perforation.
No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
2) Massive lymphadenopathy involving the portahepatis, celiac access region as well as the retroperitoneal in the upper abdomen related to the patient's underlying disease.
There is mild adenopathy in the right paratracheal and subcarinal region.
3) Patchy opacities in both lungs which are likely infectious in origin.
4) Hypodense lesions in the right kidney might represent areas of pyelonephritis.
5) Cystic lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney likely represents a complex cyst.
Acute hemorrhagic gangrenous cholecystitis and pericholecystitis.
Acute hemorrhagic gangrenous cholecystitis and pericholecystitis with colonies of Gram (+) cocci on Gram stain (with satisfactory control).
Lymph node, root of mesentery (D): Lymph node extensively infiltrated by acute myeloid leukemic cells with features highly suggestive of acute myelomonocytic leukemia with abnormal eosinophils (M4EO).
This profile is consistent with a myeloid phenotype of the malignant cells.
Some of the reagents used in these assays may not be approved for diagnostic use.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No significant interval change in the perihepatic fluid collections, some of which contain air.
Additionally, there is no interval change in the appearance of the fluid tracking along the right colic gutter and through the subcutaneous tissues, consistent with the patient's history of biliary cutaneous fistula.
Peripheral, ill-defined, nodular appearing, bilateral lower lobe opacities, some of which are new and others of which have changed in configuration since the prior exam, suggestive of an inflammatory/infectious or embolic process (either bland or septic emboli).
Stable bronchovascular bundle thickening and unchanged appearance of other peripheral nodules raises concern for underlying leukemic infiltration.
Stable retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, consistent with the patient's history of leukemia.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
A bioprosthetic tricuspid valve is present with mildly thickened, but mobile leaflets.
There is mild valvular tricuspid regurgitation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable for review) of [**2127-9-26**], the transtricuspid gradient is slightly reduced and borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now identified.
The aortic valve gradient is similar and aortic regurgitation is no longer seen.
SKIN BIOPSY (RIGHT FLANK) ([**2127-10-29**]) : DIAGNOSIS: Skin, right flank: Vascular endothelial swelling and sparse interstitial mononuclear infiltrate with occasional eosinophils (see note).
CT ABD/PELV ([**2127-11-4**]): IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of bowel obstruction.
4) Persistent marked ascites and anasarca.
5) Unchanged celiac axis lymphadenopathy.
6) Unchanged patchy opacities at the lung bases and small bilateral pleural effusions.
No definite acute hemorrhage.
Low density focus in the left internal capsule that is of uncertain etiology.
CD34 positive blasts are not increased (<3%).
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 57133**] presented to an outside hospital with acute cholecystitis (which was secondary to malignant infiltration of her gall bladder) and was transfered to  [**Hospital1 18**] for the surgical management of her cholecystitis as well as the management of her newly discovered acute myelogenous leukemia.
AML: On routine labs at the outside hospital, the patient was noted to have an elevated WBC (>60) with blasts (50% of the WBC).
A bone marrow biopsy at [**Hospital1 18**] confirmed acute leukemia of myelomonocytic differentiation.
The patient was initially managed with daily Hydroxyurea until she recovered from the surgical management of her acute cholecystitis.
No bacteria or fungii were ever grown from her blood or urine.
She was prophylaxed with acyclovir (she developed an HSV lesion on her upper lip during her course), vancomycin, along with the empiric fungal (caspofunging or ambisome) and gram negative (which included imipenem, amikacin, cefipime and levofloxacin at different times in her course).
She was discharged with oncologic follow-up and planned for consolidation chemotherapy.
Cholecystitis: The patient presented to the outside hospital with an acute abdomen.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of her acute cholecystitis.
An initial plan for percutaneous placement of a cholecystostomy tube for stabilization was pursued, but due to imaging findings revealing the unlikliehood of successful drainage of her gallbladder contents, surgical cholecystostomy and intrahepatic biliary stenting was pursued.
A necrotic gallbladder with multiple septations and intrahepatic abscess collections, which extended down the right pericolic gutter along the right colon were noted.
Pathologic analysis showed malignant infilitration (with leukemic cells) of the gallbladder and extrahepatic biliary tree.
After unsuccessful attempts, the procedure/sphincterotomy was complicated by a large gastrointestinal bleed and the patient required monitoring and blood/volume resucitation in the ICU.
A repeat ERCP was pursued and epinephrine injection and biliary stenting resulted in tamponade of the bleeding site and successful diversion of biliary drainage.
Her cholecystectomy was also complicated by post-operative hemoperitoneum requiring repeat laporatomy.
A large volume of bloody fluid was removed from the abdomen, but active bleeding was not seen.
The patient had persistence of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting throughout most of her course, but repeat imaging studies did not reveal and obvious source of her symptoms.
On discharge, her nausea and vomiting had resolved and her abdominal pain was controlled with low-dose narcotics.
For several days, late in her course, she became incoherent and could not follow commands.
A Head CT only showed a nonspecific unilateral internal capsule abnormality.
An HCV viral load was rechecked during recurrent abominal pain, nausea, vomiting and altered mental status: at that point, the viral load was 154,000.
Her native aortic and mitral valves were surgically replaced with porince prosthetics.
The neurologic deficits (weakness) resolved prior to this admission.
Tramadol HCl 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO four times a day as needed for pain for 1 weeks.
Senna 8.6 mg Capsule Sig: [**12-6**] Capsules PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Instructions: 1) Please contact the on-call oncologist at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2756**], your doctor or come to the [**Hospital1 18**] emergency room if you have any nausea, vomiting, increased abdominal pain, bleeding, fevers, chills, or any other concerning symptoms.
