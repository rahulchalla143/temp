The pain is sharp and nonradiating and is worse with sitting up.
He also complains of shortness of breath, but he feels this is because it was very painful to breath at all.
He has had decreased appetite and poor PO intake for the last 2 days.
His labs were notable for a leukocytosis to 14,000 with 22 bands, a creatinine of 1.7, and a lactate of 3.5.
He also received morphine, toradol and dilaudid for pain control.
Cardiac enzymes were negative and EKG was without ischemic changes.
He denied shortness of breath, fevers/chills.
He noted that as long as his pain was controlled, his breathing felt comfortable.
He felt very thirsty.
Shortly after arrival to the floor the patient triggered for tachycardia to 150 while attempting to give a sputum sample.
Telemetry monitoring showed a narrow complex tachycardia with p waves present that lasted for about 6 minutes.
His tachycardia broke with a valsalva maneuver and his heart rate returned to the 90s.
Past Medical History: Hemochromatosis HTN (used to be on lisinopril, stopped taking meds) s/p CVA [**96**] years ago.
No residual deficits.
Neck: No JVD, no LAD Cor: RRR no m/r/g Pulm: No breath sounds at the left base, +dullness to percussion and reduced fremitus at LLL.
Diffuse musical wheezing and rhonchi.
Abd: soft +BS, NT/ND, No HSM Extrem: no c/c/e, strong pulses.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2171-3-14**] sinus tachycardia is new.
[**2188-10-11**] CXR - CONCLUSION: Dense pneumonic consolidation in the left lower lobe.
Dense pneumonic consolidation involving most of the left lower lobe, please ensure followup to clearance.
Up to 4 mm scattered pulmonary nodules in the right lower lobe should be followed up with a chest CT in six months if the patient is at high risk of cancer.
Contour deformities in the liver and splenic enlargement consistent with cirrhosis.
[**2188-10-13**] TTE - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened (left coronary leaflet) but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Protruding Lesions 4 cords of grade I varices were seen in the lower third of the esophagus and middle third of the esophagus.
Impression: Erythema in the gastroesophageal junction compatible with esophagitis (biopsy) Varices at the lower third of the esophagus and middle third of the esophagus Erythema in the antrum compatible with gastritis (biopsy) Erythema in the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: Avoid all NSAIDS and [**Doctor Last Name **]-2 inhibitors.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 56 year old male with a history of hemochromatosis and CAP, who presents with LLL pneumonia and hypoxia.
# Sepsis from LLL pneumonia - The patient was admitted with an elevated lactate, hypothermia, leukocytosis with marked bandemia, acute renal failure, hypoxia, and  CT findings consistent with LLL pneumonia.
The patient was given dilaudid for pain control.
Patient no longer had pleuritic chest pain on discharge.
-He should receive pneumovax, influenza vaccine, and hepatitis B vaccine as an outpatient given his history of pneumonia.
# HTN - has hx of HTN and LVH on echo; would like to better control, currently not on any medicines.
# Acute Renal Failure ??????
The patient presented with acute renal failure with a creatinine elevated to 1.7.
This was likely secondary to dehydration given poor PO intake prior to admission and resolution with IVF.
# Hemochromatosis:  The patient has not had follow-up for his hemachromatosis for several years (previously was followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and has not gone in for therapeutic phlebotomy in several years because he lost his insurance.
# Cirrhosis:  The patient had evidence of cirrhosis on CT scan and a subsequent RUQ ultrasound study with an elevated INR and total bili.
His cirrhosis is likely secondary to hemochromatosis given his ferritin > [**2179**].
Screening EGD was done, and stage 1 esophageal varices were noted in the mid/lower esophagus.
He was also found to have gastritis, and was started on Protonix.
# Thrombocytopenia - The patient has splenomegaly on CT scan.
Unclear whether the thrombocytopenia is secondary to splenic sequestration vs. marrow infiltration vs. sepsis.
# Pulmonary nodules - discovered on CT scan.
He Should obtain a repeat CT scan in [**5-1**] months to evaluate for interval changes or resolution.
Please recheck TSH and T4 as an outpatient and treat accordingly.
Pulse dose for portability.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Left lower lobe pneumonia cirrhosis secondary to hemochromatosis esophageal varices hypertension thrombocytopenia   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a severe pneumonia.
You also have a cirrhotic liver and esophageal varices which puts you at risk of having a major bleed from your esophagus.
Please call your doctor or go to the emergency room if you have shortness of breath, fevers, difficulty breathing, bleeding, abdominal pain, headache, or chest pain.
If you have any other symptoms that concern you please call your doctor.
Followup Instructions: Your primary care doctor will need to evaluate  your pulmonary nodules with a CT scan, and also give you a hepatitis B vaccine.
