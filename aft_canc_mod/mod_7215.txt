There is a persistent left retrocardiac opacity and small unchanged left-sided pleural effusion.
Left retrocardiac opacity representing atelectasis and small left-sided pleural effusion.
There has been an increase in the left-sided pleural effusion since the prior day.
There appears to be a new small right- sided pleural effusion.
Increased retrocardiac density on the left side is consistent with combination of fluid together with likely atelectasis/airspace disease.
Mild prominence of the interstitial markings is visible.
IMPRESSION: Increasing left-sided pleural effusion.
Small new right-sided pleural effusion.
Increased interstitial markings.
Subsegmental atelectasis/airspace disease both bases, more marked on the left side.
Perihilar haziness has slightly worsened, as well as a bilateral pattern of interstitial opacities.
Confluent opacity in left retrocardiac region adjacent to a small-to-moderate left effusion is unchanged.
Small right pleural effusion has slightly increased.
Stool cx: Negative for C.diff  Brief Hospital Course: 87 F h/o CVA with previous trach, still G-tube'ed, now presents with witnessed aspiration with respiratory distress.
# Respiratory distress: presumed secondary to aspiration pneumonitis and fluid overload.
WBC difficult to interpret given h/o CLL.
CXR with atelectasis and small left-sided pleural effusion.
However, patient's sputum cx showed only contamination and she remained afebrile.
There was a component of fluid overload based on bibasilar crackles and + JVD.
She received supportive care including hydration as needed and loperamide added for symptomatic relief.
# Atrial fibrillation: ventricular response in 120s, likely secondary to current pulmonary process.
Overall low suspicion for active ischemia.
# CLL: no acute issues .
