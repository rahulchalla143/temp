Patient was scheduled for head and torso CT tomorrow, as well as initial appointments with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on Wednesday [**12/2101**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1852**], oncology, this Friday, [**1-28**], however, her degree of dyspnea and weakness at home worsened to the point where she did not feel safe and was unable to stay hydrated.
She also c/o nausea and liquid stools.
A CT head and CT torso were ordered and were negative for any acute intracranial process or pulmonary embolism, respectively.
On arrival to the MICU, pt is fairly comfortable, comlaining of shortness of breath and abdominal pain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
Past Medical History: Polycystic ovarian syndrome  Social History: - Tobacco: none - Alcohol: none - Illicits: none  Family History: No family h/o malignancy.
Vitals: Afebrile BP:117/110 P: 118 R: 22 O2:98% on ra General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, dry mucous membranes, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: tachycardic, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi Abdomen: distended, tenderness to palpation throughout the entire abdomen, hepatomegaly with liver tip felt 2 cm below the sternal border GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, 1+ pitting edema to the level of the ankle Neuro: CNII-XII intact, 5/5 strength upper/lower extremities, grossly normal sensation.
No spontaneous heart sounds or respirations.
Pupils non-reactive and without noxious withdrawal.
IMAGING STUDIES: [**2185-1-25**] CT CHEST, ABD & PELVIS WITH CO - Massive hepatomegaly with extensive hepatic metastasis, upper abdominal lymphadenopathy, moderate ascites.
Bilateral small lung nodules, concerning for metastasis.
Mildly enlarged nodes in the chest.
No pulmonary embolism.
There is right atrial compression from massive hepatomegaly and liver mets, likely resulting in low volume/flow to right side of heart (decrease in preload).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Suboptimal image quality.
Hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Normal right ventricular size with normal/hyperdynamic function.
No significant valvular disease.
She presented with a relatively new diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma of undetermined primary.
She was transferred to the ICU given worsening anuric renal failure, metabolic acidosis and uremia in the setting of a respiratory compensation.
