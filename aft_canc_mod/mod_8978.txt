Patient has AML-M5a diagnosed [**2123-4-25**] when he presented with septic arthritis of the right knee and dental infections.
He was found to have clonal loss of Y (usually considered a favorable cytogenetic finding) and no other cytogenitic abnormalities (NPM neg, FLT3 Neg) and was treated with 7+3 daunorubicin (90mg/m2) and cytarabine (100mg/m2/d x 7dCI) on [**5-14**].
Induction was complicated by multifocal PNA and effusive and constrictive inflammatory pericarditis.
This was complicated by a morbilliform rash and there was some thought that this was due to cytarabine and the dose was reduced on days 3 and 5 to 2 g/m2.
Cycle 2 of High DAC was at full dose (3gm/m2 Q12 day 1,3,5 ) he had a minor rash but otherwise tolerated it well with a brief admission during his nadir for neutropenic malaise and chills at home (no temperature recorded).
He complains of mild constipation, denies fevers, chills, sweats or malaise.

REASON FOR THE EXAM:  43-year-old man with AML, now with fever, rigors, hypertension and abdominal pain.
Please evaluate for acute intra-abdominal process.
FINDINGS:  Imaged through the lung bases demonstrate presence of bilateral pleural effusions, tiny, however, new compared to the prior study.
There is no cardiomegaly.
There is no pericardial effusion.
ABDOMEN:  Liver enhances homogeneously with no evidence of focal masses.
There is no intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Gallbladder is normal in appearance with no evidence of focal masses or pericholecystic fluid.
Both kidneys enhance and secrete normally with no evidence of suspicious masses, hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis or urinary obstruction.
Again seen multiple small mesenteric lymph nodes within the mid abdomen with some stranding of the mesentery, unchanged from the prior study.
There is some new mucosal enhancement within the cecum and ascending colon with no significant wall thickening.
No significant pericolonic inflammatory stranding is seen.
There is no evidence of abscess or perforation.
There is minimal amount of fluid within the dependent pelvis.
No evidence of lymphadenopathy.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No evidence of destructive lytic lesions.
There is no evidence of blastic metastasis.
Minimal mucosal enhancement within the cecum and ascending colon, new from the prior study, which may represent a mild/developing typhlitis.
There is no pericolonic stranding or abscess.
There are no signs of perforation.
Unchanged appearance of fat stranding and small multiple nodules within the mid mesentery compared to the prior study, which may represent mesenteric panniculitis.

Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2123-9-27**]):    NO GROWTH.
MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2123-9-24**]):    No MRSA isolated.

Brief Hospital Course: 43M with AML-M5a admitted for scheduled cycle 3 HiDAC consolidation chemotherapy who was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] of Day2 for hypotension, fever tachycardia,  # Acute myelogenous leukemia (monocytic): AML-M5a diagnosed [**2123-4-25**] when he presented with septic arthritis of the right knee and dental infections.
Clonal loss of Y and no other cytogenitic abnormalities (NPM neg, FLT3 Neg).
Course complicated by [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] transfer for fever, hypotension, and tachycardia ?
sepsis from developing typhilits ( see below) and diffuse macular puritic rash most likely secondary to cytarabine ( see below).
# Sepsis- The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**2123-9-22**] ( day 2 of his HiDAC) with hypotension ( SBPs as low as 70s), fever 101.6, and tachycardic to the 140s, with associated rigors.
A CT abdomen/pelvis from [**9-22**] was signficant for mild/developing typhilitis as the possible infectious source.
He had a cortisol stimulation test on [**9-23**] with a borderline suboptimal response, and low baseline cortisol, and was started on stress dose steroids.
On transfer to the floor the patient was formally evaluated by endocrine, who recommended a repeat cortisol stimulation test, since the  patient had received dexamethasone prior to the first test.
The repeat cortisol stimulation test on [**2123-9-25**] was normal, making adrenal insufficiency an unlikely cause of the patient's hypotensive episode.
#Rash: The patient had puritic, diffuse, macular rash, after his third dose of HiDAC.
The rash was most likely a reaction to the  cytarabine, as the patient reported similar reactions in the past while receiving cytarabine.
The patient used topical triamcinolone cream and diphehydramine PRN and the rash ultimately resolved prior to discharge  ----------- CHRONIC STABLE ISSUES  #Anal fissure: Improved per patient, no signs of fissure or peri-rectal abscess on exam.
continued with  bowel regimen  # Chronic knee pain: Patient had intermittent worsening of chronic knee pain but symptoms and physical exam were not concerning for septic joint.

You were admitted for scheduled chemotherapy for your acute myelogenous leukemia.
On day 2 of your chemotherpay you had low blood pressure, fever, and a fast heart rate concerning for an infection (sepsis).
A CT scan was done, which showed a developing infection in your bowel ( typhilitis), for which you will need 5 days of antibiotics.
