Vascular Surgery admitted her out of concern for ischemic entero-colitis of terminal ileum and cecum.
Pt was asymptomatic during her stay and tolerated PO well, so d/c with close GI outpatient follow-up planned.
On review of CT scan after colonoscopy, there was a concern for ventral hernia possibly causing paroxysmal attacks of abdominal pain.
She returned home and ate soft foods out of concern for recurrent GI pain.
Early this morning she noted recurrent abdominal pain and presented to [**Hospital3 **].

CXR showed L basilar atelectasis only.
Surgery was consulted, and per verbal discussion concluded that the patient had no obstructive symptoms.
On the floor, she denies nausea or abdominal pain.

Brief Hospital Course: 82F with h/o HTN, HLD, chronic 2yr h/o paroxysmal abdominal pain of unclear etiology p/w recurrent abdominal pain and CT evidence of SBO.
# Bowel Obstruction:  The patient on admission had CT evidence of obstruction with recent nausea and vomiting, current burping, and no recent flatus.
Her abdominal exam was benign with some mild distension.
She continued to have nausea with any intake.
MR Enterography performed for diagnostic purposes [**12-6**] revealed continued obstruction due to persistent cecal inflammation.
Due to the prolonged course of her obstruction, PPN was started to provide some nutritional support and aid healing, however, this was discontinued on [**12-7**].
# Ileitis and enterocolitis:  Recent workup was concerning for ventral hernia, chronic mesenteric ischemia, inflammatory bowel disease, infectious colitis, and malignancy.
TTG-IgA for possible celiac was negative, as was CMV viral load and cryptococcus and Giardia antigens.
This showed that the ileitis had resolved, but that the colitis at the cecum persisted.
There was no clear evidence by imaging or prior colonoscopy as to the etiology of this finding.
Leukocytosis resolved.
On this admission, we continued to recommend outpatient follow-up, as this is not likely associated with current symptoms.
Set up appointment with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] of Urology for consultation.
Transitional Issues: - Continue follow-up of renal mass with Urology as outpatient (appt with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] - Continue follow-up with Gastroenterology (appt in early [**Month (only) **]) - Blood and urine cultures pending  Following above hospital course, surgical consultation was obtained [**12-8**] for [**Month/Year (2) **] of terminal ileal stricture/small bowel obstruction demonstrated both clinically and on MR enterography.
Intra-operative findings were notable for perforated cecal tumor with narrowing of the terminal ileum.
Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient was received intermittent IV narcotic analgesics with good effect and adequate pain control.
Initially postop patient demonstrated altered mental status and this improved significantly [**2073-12-9**] with return of mental status to [**Month/Day/Year 5348**].
CV: Patient was hypotensive postop with requirement of neo vasopressor support.
Fluid resuscitation was pursued with crystalloid/colloid fluid.
TTE postop demonstrated hypovolemia and goal directed resuscitation was pursued.
Nutrition assessed the patient and recommended high protein supplements with each meal.
Patient was oliguric postoperatively.
Crystalloid IVF boluses were administered in conjunction with colloid bolus.
The patient's temperature was closely watched for signs of infection.
DISPO: Patient admitted to TSICU postoperatively for hypotension and oliguria.
At the time of discharge to rehab, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating with assistance, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
Medications on Admission: simvastatin 20 mg DAILY aspirin 81 mg DAILY levothyroxine 25 mcg Tablet DAILY prednisone 5 mg EVERY OTHER DAY ferrous sulfate 300  mg DAILY omeprazole 40 mg Capsule DAILY triamterene-hydrochlorothiazide 37.5-25 mg DAILY atenolol 100 mg DAILY dicyclomine 10 mg four times a day as needed for abdominal pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: bowel obstruction   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had been recently discharged from our facility with planned outpatient follow-up, however you felt your symptoms were worsening.
You were found to have a bowel obstruction, a condition in which inflamed bowel becomes tangled and does not allow passage of stomach contents.
A nasogastric tube was placed to help decompress your stomach to allow the obstruction to resolve.
Our Gastroenterology team evaluated your case and obstruction during your stay.
They recommended several tests to continue the workup of your abdominal pain, including an MR enterography of the small bowel.
