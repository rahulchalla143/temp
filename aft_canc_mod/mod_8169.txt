Admission Date:  [**2180-4-16**]     Discharge Date:  [**2180-4-25**]  Date of Birth:   [**2108-4-21**]     Sex:  M   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is a 71-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed in [**2170**], status post CHOP treatment, in remission, also with hypertension who presented to the Emergency Department with  The patient reported that the abdominal pain, fevers, and sweats began approximately three weeks prior to admission.
The pain was noted to be in his abdomen just below his rib cage; mostly localized near his umbilicus.
The patient was noted to be dull and constant and without significant change during eating.
The patient did notice some anorexia and also feverish on and off and had chills and sweats at night.
Shortly after that, he developed diarrhea which seemed to get worse when he ate.
The pain was disabling.
Given the patient's abdominal pain, a CT scan was obtained in the Emergency Department which revealed a thrombus of the superior mesenteric vein.
High cholesterol.
ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.
His head and neck examination showed moist mucous membranes without scleral icterus.
His neck had no jugular venous distention.
His cardiovascular examination showed an irregular rhythm, a soft 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.
His abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, without hepatosplenomegaly.
His lower extremities demonstrated no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
The patient's coagulations showed a slightly elevated INR of 1.3.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted for workup of the abdominal mass noted on CT scan, for treatment of diarrhea, and for evaluation of superior mesenteric vein clot.
The Vascular Surgery Service also recommended a CT angiogram of the abdomen to be obtained to delineate the pancreatic area given a small amount of stranding seen around the pancreas, there was a question it may be an abdominal mass versus a recurrent of his non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
There was no obvious reason for the superior mesenteric vein thrombosis.
Overnight from [**4-16**] to [**4-17**], there was a small amount of mild epigastric tenderness noted.
It was decided at that point to transfuse 2 units of packed red blood cells to the patient; although, there was no hematuria or bright red blood per rectum, and there was no obvious source for his bleeding.
This CT angiogram demonstrated a prominent periaortic lymph node in the chest which were consistent with old lymphomatotic disease.
There was also a large lymph node in the right inguinal region which was immediately adjacent to the femoral artery and vein which was not producing any venous occlusion.
There was noted to a large infiltrate of soft tissue density within the mesentery with encasement and thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein.
The infiltrate of soft tissue could be lymphoma neural residual which would cause thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein.
Alternatively, the changes could be inflammation secondary to the venous occlusion.
The presence of multiple lymph nodes within the retroperitoneum was noted which also favor lymphoma with secondary thrombosis.
A deep venous thrombosis was noted within the pancreas, but there were no other secondary signs of pancreatitis, although there was a small amount of stranding on the original CT scan when the patient was admitted.
There was no evidence of small bowel inflammation or ischemia.
On [**4-18**], the patient continued to do well with no dramatic changes in his laboratory values.
The urine culture was negative, as was his stool Clostridium difficile culture.
On [**2180-4-18**], the Blue Surgical Service of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted to see the patient by the Vascular Surgery Service given a question of soft tissue density within enhancement and thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein.
As noted, the patient was a 71-year-old male with a past history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis of unclear etiology.
This procedure was complicated by a transient occlusion with thrombolysis catheter which demonstrated a kinking of the catheter within the sheath.
This kink was unclotted, and free flow of thrombolysis resumed.
His vital signs were noted to be stable with a slight increase in hematocrit.
There were no events overnight.
On [**4-20**], an Infectious Disease consultation was obtained by the Surgical Intensive Care Unit team given the patient's positive blood cultures from admission as well as continued fevers while on intravenous antibiotics.
The assessment was this was a 71-year-old patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in remission with a superior mesenteric vein thrombus and with anaerobic gram-negative rod bacteremia.
The focus of infection in the microbiologic growth implicated a gut flora.
It was felt that his current regimen would cover gut anaerobes and aerobic bacteria; but, however, was suboptimal for enterococcus, but since there was no enterococcus isolated so far, and the patient appeared to be better, there was no need to change his antibiotic regimen.
On colonoscopy, the colonoscope revealed two small hyperplastic polyps within the rectum, and the colonoscopy was otherwise normal from the cecum to the terminal ileum.
On this study, a small hiatal hernia was seen.
He was without complaints.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed in [**2170**].
Superior mesenteric venous thrombosis; status post thrombus embolization with t-PA.
