No focal airspace opacification or suspicious nodule is seen.
There are non-pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
There is no biliary dilatation.
No lymphadenopathy or abnormal mass.
Right kidney contains numerous cysts and several subcentimeter hypodensities which are too small to completely characterize but likely cysts.
There is no hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.
The left kidney has some surrounding nonspecific perinephric stranding, and an ill-defined area of decreased attenuation at the lower pole, which may represent a small infarct or focal pyelonephritis.
There is no hydronephrosis or delayed excretion when compared to the contralateral kidney.
No surrounding nodes.
There are coarse calcifications within the prostate.

CT ANGIOGRAPHY: Thoracic aorta maintains normal course and caliber with conventional arterial arch anatomy.
There is a small amount of calcified atherosclerotic plaque at the arch and within the descending thoracic aorta.
No large vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, although echocardiography would be much more sensitive modality.
Below the diaphragm, there is both soft and hard atherosclerotic plaques with a small penetrating aortic ulcer posteriorly at or just beyond the level of the celiac axis.
Just beyond the SMA origin, there is a focal narrowing due to large area of mural thrombus.
There is no aneurysmal dilatation of the abdominal aorta.
At the aortic bifurcation, there is a moderate amount of mural thrombus with a focal linear filling defect in the left common iliac (3, 173).
The ipsilateral hypogastric artery is thrombosed, although the distal hypogastric does opacify, likely through collateral vessels.
There are post-procedural changes around the left SFA with edema and fluid/gas within the subcutaneous soft tissues.
The right internal and external iliac arteries are patent, as are the right common, profunda, and superficial femoral arteries.
There is mild atherosclerotic plaque involving these vessels.
There is a small right hydrocele.
No aneurysmal dilatation seen as a source for thrombus.
There is dissection and mural thrombus involving the proximal left common iliac artery with significant narrowing, as well as thrombosis of that ipsilateral internal iliac artery.
Marked narrowing of the SMA beyond the origin due to soft plaque, good opacification of the distal vessels, however.
Ill-defined area of decreased enhancement at the lower pole of the left kidney which is suspicious for focal pyelonephritis or infarct.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2199-5-2**] There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

VENOUS DUP EXT UNI (MAP/DVT) LEFT  [**2199-5-6**] 10:51 AM FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed in the left lower extremity veins as well as the left groin arterial vessels.
In the left groin, the common femoral artery and vein as well as the superficial femoral artery and vein were visualized noted to be widely patent with triphasic arterial waveforms.
No evidence of pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous fistula.
Analysis of the venous structures reveals normal compression and augmentation of the common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and peroneal veins.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.
No evidence of left groin pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous fistula.
His NSTEMI was attributed to demand ischemia [**2-9**] anemia.

You make take Tylenol or prescribed pain medications for any post procedure pain or discomfort  What to expect when you go home: It is normal to have slight swelling of the legs: ??????
Elevate your leg above the level of your heart (use [**2-10**] pillows or a recliner) every 2-3 hours throughout the day and at night ??????
Avoid prolonged periods of standing or sitting without your legs elevated ??????
Your incision may be left uncovered, unless you have small amounts of drainage from the wound, then place a dry dressing or band aid over the area that is draining, as needed ??????
Numbness, coldness or pain in lower extremities ??????
New or increased drainage from incision or white, yellow or green drainage from incisions ??????
Bleeding from groin puncture site  SUDDEN, SEVERE BLEEDING OR SWELLING (Groin puncture site) ??????
