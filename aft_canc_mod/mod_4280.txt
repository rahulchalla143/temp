Was lethargic and confused, not answering questions appropriately so his wife gave him an extra dose of Lactulose.
Later that morning at 10AM she found him unresponsive with slow breathing.
His hospital course has been significant for GI bleed (Hct 32 but was noted to pass some blood clots per rectum so received a total of 3u pRBC, 2u FFP, vitamin K, and is on an IV PPI and Octreotide gtt), fever to 102 of unclear source being covered empirically with CTX/Flagyl then switched to Zosyn/Flagyl on [**2-19**] when he developed a leukocytosis, and shaking episodes yesterday and today (head tilting to right with head jerking movements - received Ativan yesterday).
Not responding to voice but withdrawing from pain.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: - EtOH and Hep C Cirrhosis, Hepatocellular CA, Ascites, ESLD - s/p [**2122-1-1**] TACE transarterial chemoembolization of HCC - 3 bands of grade 1 varices, last bleed [**2119**] ([**State 108**]) - failed treatment for HCV (IFN, IFN/Ribavirin 10 yesrs ago) - GI bleed from duodenal ulcer - Dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 55% - Hypertension - Hypogonadism - IBS .
Past Surgical history: - Herniorrhaphy x 3 - Right wrist fracture s/p fixation - Left toe surgery - Knee arthroscopy x 4   Social History: -Home: Lives with wife [**Name (NI) **].
-Tobacco: None -EtOH: prior history of heavy use, quit 6 yrs ago but relapsed and now has been sober again for 6 months -Illicits: None   Family History: No history of cancer or hepatitis.
Resp: CTAB, no rhonchi or crackles Abd: Obese but nondistended, no rebound or guarding Ext: Warm, 2+ DP and PT pulses bilaterally; no edema or cyanosis; right femoral CVL site with no erythema or hematoma Neuro: withdraws to pain, VOR intact, bracioradialis 2+ bilaterally, patellar reflexes 1+ bilaterally  Discharge: Expired   Pertinent Results: [**2122-2-18**] EGD (OSH) small esophageal varices without bleeding, no blood in the stomach, nodules in the gastric body, few gastric antral erosions .
Abnormality of the right hemicolon with mural thickening may be secondary to portal hypertension although the possibility of colitis is difficult to exclude 2.
Hepatic cirrhosis and new extensive abnormality in the right lobe of the liver suspicious for HCC 3.
Right renal cyst unchanged and isodense nodule of right kidney also unchanged 7.
Colonic diverticulosis without acute diverticulitis 8.
Small right inguinal hernia containing fat 9.
Bibasilar atelectasis and/or infiltrates .
[**2122-2-18**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST (OSH) No evidence of acute intracranial abnormality.
No significant ascitic fluid noted.
Hyperdense material within the cecum and small bowel resection anastomosis.
These regions are potential candidates for a bleed source.
No active extravasation is seen.
New, likely bland thrombus within the main portal (nearly occlusive) and right portal veins (occlusive)and origin of left portla vein (nearly occlusive) since the [**2122-1-29**] MR examination.
Post-TACE changes and small hypodense nodules, representing tumor thrombi, in segment 5.
No definite arterially enhancing hepatic lesions identified.
Small amount of abdominal and pelvic ascites.
Precipitants could include upper GI bleed, medication effect (was on a Versed drip at OSH for ~36h), or infection (see "fevers" below).
Switched to bolus sedation and continued lactulose and rifaximin without improvement of mental status.
Given his poor prognosis and absence of mental status, patient was terminally extubated on [**2-21**] and transitioned to CMO.
Bloody loose stools: lower GI bleed vs brisk upper GI bleed.
Has history of bleeding ulcers as well as esophageal varices.
At the OSH, he underwent EGD showing portal gastropathy and small gastric nodules which were not bleeding; had "diminutive varices."
Patient had persistent Hct drops during this hospitalization along with persistently bloody bowel movements.
Patient was transfused a total of 5units and CTA was obtained showing sources of bleeding in the cecum and at a prior small bowel anastomosis, likely ectopic varices.
Initial plan was for colonoscopy but goals of care were discussed with family and as it was felt that this was a nonintervenable source of bleeding, supportive transfusions were discontinued and no further interventions were undertaken.
Fevers: Initially concerning for infection.
Had leukocytosis and had bandemia at OSH.
Tap here was not suggestive of infection and CXR and urine were unremarkable.
[**Last Name (un) **]: Prerenal with low urine Na and FeNa.
# Code Status: Given patient's persistent absence of mental status improvement, his poor prognosis given his underlying HCC and ongoing GI bleed, patient was made CMO on HD #2.
