CXR showed bilateral pleural effusion, diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities, concerning for multifocal pneumonia.
On arrival to the floor, the patient denies any complaints other than shortness of breath.
Moderate secondary pulmonary hypertension.
Family History: Father died of congestive heart failure in his 70's.
Mother died of congestive heart failure at age 88.
HEENT: Anicteric sclerae.
JVD present.
Resp: Diffusely rhonchorous.
Decreased breath sounds at bases.
Difficult to appreicate presence or absense of murmur over breath sounds.
1+ bilateral lower extremity edema.
CXR (portable AP) [**2152-4-29**]: bilateral pleural effusion, diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities, concerning for multifocal pneumonia .
EKG: Atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate 104.
Partial right bundle branch block.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 year old woman who presented with pulmonary edema from atrial fibrillation, acute diastolic heart failure, and prolapsed and regurgitant mitral valve.
She initially presented with progressive shortness of breath with chest x-ray read as "multifocal pneumonia".
She had leukocytosis, elevated lactate, and tachycardia in the setting of "suspected recurrent aspiration pneumonia".
However, I believe she had pulmonary edema and she appeared fluid overloaded with jugular venous distension and peripheral edema with very suggestive CXR of edema.
Her atrial fibrillation was rate controlled with increased doses of Diltiazem ( 90 MG Q 6 hours then 360 of Cardiazem CD; she could not swallow the latter and therefore she was discharged on the short acting).
She was found to have severe esophageal narrowings by EGD (upper narrowing and GE narrowing with dilated esophagus between) that made TEE difficult.
She denied any pneumonia prior to these recent 2 episodes.
She did not have symptoms consistant possible reflux and aspiration and she was be advanced to thin liquids and regular consistency solids.
She did not undergo TEE with cardioversion because of the severe esophageal narrowing.
She was asked to keep head of bed elevated at 45 degrees at all times to minimize risk of gastroesophageal reflux and aspiration and to avoid eating for 3 hours prior to sleep.
Disp:*120 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: pulmonary edema atrial fibrillation acute diastolic heart failure prolapsed and regurgitant mitral valve cardioversion esophageal narrowings that was treated with Botox injections.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because of pulmonary edema (water in the lungs) from atrial fibrillation (fast and abnormal heart rhythem), diastolic heart failure (weak heart), and prolapsed (floppy) and regurgitant (leaky) mitral valve.
You DID NOT HAVE TEE (echo from the mouth) with cardioversion.
We also found esophageal narrowings that was treated with Botox injections.
Keep head of bed elevated at 45 degrees at all times to minimize risk of gastroesophageal reflux and aspiration Avoid eating for 3 hours prior to sleep.
