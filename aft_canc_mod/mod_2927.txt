No intra-abdominal fluid collections are seen.
There are no masses, stones, or hydronephrosis.
The bladder is collapsed, with a minimal amount of urine within it and a Foley catheter.
Prostate gland measures 4.7 by 4.9 by 3.9 cm and is heterogeneous with punctate calcifications within it.
[**10-2**] CXR: Dual chamber pace maker leads are seen projecting over the right atrium and right ventricle.
There are no pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course: Pt admitted on vanco/levo/zosyn for double coverage and levofed for hypotension X 1-2 days.
Working diagnosis was urosepsis secondary to foley/blood clot per [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] notes.
Called out on [**10-4**] and transferred to medicine service for further managment.
Bacteremia: Patient was afebrile with normalizing WBC while on the medicine floor.
It was felt that the source of this polymicrobial bacteremia was likely urinary - with fecal flora as culprit.
2)  Hemodynamics: Given 1 L LR on day of trasnfer to floor after pressors were stopped; resolution of non gap cholermic acidosis.
3)  Slightly elevated INRs on admission secondary to vit K deficiency, improved with vit K x 1 in unit.
Metastatic prostate CA: Recent diagnosis with recent GU instrumentation.
Would consider restarting antiandrogens once patient is over acute crisis of sepsis and is hemodynamically stable.
Will not D/c foley at this time as pt had obstruction with massive necrosis.
Agitation: Pt has periods of agitation at night, likely sundowning.
Access: R IJ in place, foley in place; two peripheral IVs placd; RIJ removed without complication.
