On presentation to the floor patient denies recent fever, chills, nausea, diarrhea, rash, shortness of breath, or any upper respiratory tract symptoms.
She admits to chronic peripheral neuropathy in feet which remains unchanged and R radial nerve palsy requiring a brace.
She recently fractured her R humerus which she states is healing well and pain is well controlled.
Past Medical History: Past Oncology History: Peripheral T cell lymphoma (Alk-1 negative) with CNS involvement .
The patient presented with fevers and elevated LFT's in the spring of [**2148**], at which time a bone marrow biopsy from an outside hospital demonstrated large lymphoid cells which were positive for CD30, along with CD56, CD2 (subset), and rare CD8 positive cells.
Results of a repeat biopsy performed at [**Hospital1 18**] were felt to be most consistent with peripheral T-cell lymphoma.
She has repeatedly experienced transient responses to chemotherapy with fevers and a rising LDH at the end of each chemotherapy cycle felt to be due to refractory disease.
Following her most recent treatment with ESHAP, she had temperatures of up to 105 without evidence of a source of infection.
A repeat staging evaluation included a  PET scan on [**2148-11-26**], which demonstrated patchy marrow uptake in  the vertebral bodies consistent with persistent disease.
Bone marrow biopsy showed large, atypical lymphoid cells which were CD30 negative but morphologically similar to her prior disease.
Workup has revealed no ongoing abnormalities in the liver, which  was the site of her initial presentation.
In the meantime, a cord blood donor has been identified for possible allogeneic stem cell transplant.
History of C. diff colitis 2.
Peripheral neuropathy of the lower extremities 5.
She denies using tobacco or alcohol.
Family History: Father has a history of a benign adrenal mass and has had skin cancers removed.
Her mother has hyperparathyroidism and hypertension.

INTERPRETATION Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by a T cell lymphoma with aberrant phenotype.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 35 year old woman with a history of T-cell lymphoma who was admitted for scheduled ablative chemotherapy with TBI and Cytoxan followed by allogeneic cord stem cell transplant.
On [**2149-1-27**] the pt began to spike fevers and had blood cultures that grew Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.
On Day 16 post transplant the pt was still awaiting recovery of her cell counts but had developed renal failure in the setting of likely tacrolimus toxicity and she was transfered to the ICU for initiation of hemodialysis.
At this time there was also mounting evidence (right upper quadrant, ascites) that the patient was developing [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusive disease of the liver, and the pt was started on a protocol for treatment with defibrotide.
On [**2149-2-20**] the pt's labs began to show evidence of engraftment, but soon after this the patient's fever curve began to increase as steroids were tapered.
On [**2149-2-27**] the pt's peripheral smear showed evidence of lymphoma with leukemic transformation on peripheral blood.
Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood confirmed the presence of T cell lymphoma cell markers.
