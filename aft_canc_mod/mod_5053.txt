US liver - Contiguous well-circumscribed 2.5 cm anechoic lesions within the right lobe of the liver, with an appearance consistent with cysts, small amount of perihepatic ascites, and normal vascular study.
Per neuro exam, mental status was depressed on arrival and he had an upgoing toe on the left.
He was placed on Keppra IV for seizure prophylaxis along with Ativan 2 mg IV prn for seizures lasting > 5 minutes or more than 3 seizures per hour and received EEG.
EEG ([**9-9**]) demonstrated intermittent right-sided blunted sharp wave and sharp and slow wave discharges with a right fronto central predominance at a maximal frequency of 1 Hz.
No clear evidence for ongoing seizures was seen although the presence of these discharges suggested a potential area for epileptogenesis.
The intermittent mixed frequency slowing seen in the right hemisphere suggested an area of underlying cortical or subcortical dysfunction.
Neurology recommended repeat EEG to evaluate focality initially documented and determine if Keppra should be continued.
EEG repeated [**9-13**] revealed an abnormal routine EEG in the waking and drowsy states due to the persistent right posterior quadrant slowing as well as the less frequent right posterior quadrant blunted sharp and slow waves.
No electrographic evidence of seizure was noted.
Rectal tube was additionally placed due to copious output per rectum.
Nasointestinal feeding tube placed [**9-10**] for nutritional support.
On HD 4, patient received CT abdomen which revealed: -High-density collections along the inferior right aspect of the liver and liver dome that are most consistent with hematomas.
-Low-density fluid dissecting along the biliary tree in the central portion of the liver may represent a biloma.
-Interval improvement in ascites and left pleural effusion.
-Postpyloric position of the nasogastric tube.
Mental status / confusion improved throughout course of hospital stay.
On [**9-24**] the patient was noted to have fever to 101, a CT of the abdomen was performed showing an interval increase in the low-density fluid collection extending along the porta hepatis into the hepaticoduodenal ligament.
There was concern for a biloma and a drain was placed.
About 250 cc of yellow clear fluid was removed and the drain was left in place.
The patient continued to work with physical therapy, however they found him to be quite debilitated, requiring frequent rest during ambulation and a high risk for falling based on the Tinetti score for balance and gait.
Rehabilitation goals and outcomes for distance walked and exercises performed should be communicated to the transplant team during clinic visits so assessment of progress and appropriate timing of discharge to home can be managed.
In addition the patient has had difficulties with his dentures.
Due to his weight loss his dentures are not fitting properly.
