Brief Hospital Course: Presentation: 53 year old woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis c/b varices s/p banding now presents with hematemesis x 5 at home concerning for an acute GI bleed.
An EGD was performed which showed an antral clot and evidence of portal gastropathy.
Although she had no varices seen on this and prior EGD [**2-14**], a small varix underneath the clot could not be excluded.
Pt was also given Ceftriaxone 2gm IV Q24H for SBP prophylaxis.
Anion gap acidosis: Pt had a anion gap of 20 with no delta/delta, which was most likely secondary to lactate elevation due to acute blood loss and/or liver dysfunction.
Sepsis is a possible cause of lactate elevation, however, patient was without focal signs of infection.
No evidence of acute bleeding or spontaneous bleeding, no petechia/purpura/ecchymoses on exam.
Most likely consumption or destruction vs. dilutional in setting of blood transfusions.
You were admitted because you had bloody vomit.
You were maintained on antibiotics to prevent an abdominal infection.
