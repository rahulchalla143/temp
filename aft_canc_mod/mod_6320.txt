In addition, a right apical neural sheath tumor was found incidentally during pre-operative evaluation.
Anticoagulation was resumed with Coumadin for her chronic Atrial fibrillation.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.

Incisional pain managed with oral analgesics Incisions: Sternal - healing well, no erythema or drainage Leg Left - healing well, no erythema or drainage.
Edema: 1+ bilat LE edema   Discharge Instructions: Shower daily including washing incisions gently with mild soap, no baths or swimming until cleared by surgeon.
Look at your incisions daily for redness or drainage.
Followup Instructions: You are scheduled for the following appointments Surgeon: Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] appointment was arranged for Wednesday, [**8-9**] at 1pm Please call to schedule appointments with your Primary Care: PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) **],[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 60570**] in [**2-4**] weeks Cardiologist:    Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Doctor Last Name 2194**] in [**2-4**] weeks  Your pre-operative workup revealed a neural sheath tumor located at the top of your right lung.
We consulted the neurosurgery team who believed this change to be chronic in nature requiring no immediate intervention.
