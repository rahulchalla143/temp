Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: -Noted a nonhealing ulcer on the back of her left calf over the summer of [**2144**].
- [**9-/2144**], she noted that this ulcer was getting larger and she was referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13712**] who performed a biopsy [**2144-10-20**], which revealed an approximately 4-mm deep, ulcerated melanoma with a high mitotic rate.
- [**2144-11-3**], she underwent a wide local excision with pathology again revealing an approximately 4-mm ulcerated melanoma with a high mitotic rate; had delayed healing from the skin graft and required many visits by VNA - At the time of her initial visit to [**Hospital1 18**] cutaneous oncology program on [**2145-1-20**], it was identified that she had numerous in-transit metastases.
- PET CT [**2145-2-1**] left iliac and bilateral inguinal FDG-avid lymphadenopathy concerning for metastatic disease, as well as a left posterior calf FDG-avid lesion with FDG avid local satellite lesions.
-[**2145-2-17**] FNA of an FDG-avid right inguinal node, which showed no evidence of malignancy.
- PET CT scan [**2145-3-31**] bilateral axillary, inguinal, and pelvic adenopathy with low-level FDG avidity.
- [**2145-5-6**], she underwent left leg hypothermic isolated limb perfusion with excision of two enlarged lymph nodes that were adjacent to the vessels.
One of the two nodes contained metastatic melanoma (performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 69344**] at [**Hospital6 1129**]).

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 12130**], You were admitted to the hospital because you were having trouble breathing along with a fever.
We saw that you had a urinary tract infection and we treated you with antibiotics.
You still had shortness of breath so we did an ultrsound of your heart and a chest xray.
The heart ultrasound showed some increased blood pressure in lungs, and you felt better after getting diuretics.
