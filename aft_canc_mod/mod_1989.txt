Infectious disease:  The patient continued on intravenous Vancomycin to day 27 and remained afebrile and stable without white blood cell count elevation and with negative surveillance cultures.
He will require four weeks of additional antibiotics treatment for his sacral abscess.
They recommended Ceftazidine q 8 hours times five doses to prevent periprocedure infection in this patient with known sacral abscess.
In regard to the sacral abscess the sinus tract present was draining appropriately and healing well.
Cardiovascular:  The patient was hypotensive on admission upon the initial transfer to the MICU he was placed on pressors for one day and was weaned off and became normotensive during his hospital stay on the floor.
His blood pressure did drift down into the 80s on occasion, but was never associated with specific symptoms.
In regard to his atrial fibrillation the patient was followed by EP and was initially placed on a beta-blocker for rate control with a plan for cardioversion in the future, however, during his hospital stay the patient was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response that was minimally responsive to beta-blocker and then with the addition of Diltiazem and transient periods two times with nonrestrictive to Digoxin.
On [**2-20**] the patient was found to be in atrial flutter and not atrial fibrillation.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] of Electrophysiology ordered a transesophageal echocardiogram, which ruled out clot and took the patient for atrial flutter ablation on [**2-21**].
Over the next three days the patient's Digoxin was discontinued and his Metoprolol was decreased due to concerns of bradycardia and frequent pauses.
The patient remained with bradycardia and frequent pauses with occasional palpitations.
On [**2-29**] the patient went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and was not responsive to Lopressor intravenously or po.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] made plans to place a pacer on [**3-1**], which was done without complications.
Oncology:  The patient has multiple myeloma and continued Thalidomide and Decadron treatment per his usual protocol.
Hematology:  The patient had mild anemia during his hospital stay.
He had a history of a deep venous thrombosis and was kept therapeutic with anticoagulation for the large majority of his hospital stay.
Lower extremity ultrasound was obtained early in his hospital course to rule out the presence of deep venous thrombosis.
Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was continued on zinc and vitamin C to promote wound healing.
Endocrine:  The patient was thought to have adrenal insufficiency, but did respond to a cortisol stim test on [**2-18**].
On [**3-4**] the patient was brought to interventional radiology for proper readjustment and placement of the PICC in the SVC.
Draining sinus tract of the lumbar vertebra sacral abscess.
This abscess is C-diff colitis.
Multiple myeloma with lytic bone lesions in the lumbosacral spine.
Atrial fibrillation.
The patient will need to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of Plastic Surgery in regard to further management of his sinus tract.
CT guided drainage of abscess of the lumbosacral spine.
Atrial flutter ablation.
