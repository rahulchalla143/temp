Admission Date:  [**2128-2-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-3-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2054-3-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3043**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status, hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IVC filter placement; no plans for filter removal, per Vascular Surgery attending.
EGD/Colonscopy   History of Present Illness: 73 yo female with hx of recent admission for R hip fracture/pinning with period of hypoxia during the previous admission, now presents from rehab with unresponsiveness, refusal to take meds, hypoxia.
CTA showed bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Vascular surgery was consulted via the ED, and considering pt developed PE despite outpt prophylaxis doses of Lovenox, an IVC filter was placed, and the patient was started on heparin drip.
She does recall (with prompting) being told that there are clots in her lungs and that she had a procedure before coming to the floor.
ROS: She reports mild difficulty breathing and pain at the site of her recent surgery (right hip), as well as lower extremity swelling.
Past Medical History: Seizure disorder (developed [**1-13**] DKA in [**2095**]) breast CA s/p mastectomy with prosthetic reconstruction ([**2107**]) IDDM RA HTN glaucoma bilat TKRs .
Of note, neuropsych evaluation in [**2125**] commented that "her marked attentional impairments raises concerns around her safety, medication compliance, and other areas of functional vulnerability."
No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi CV:  RRR.
Ext:  Pitting edema in LLE, trace edema in RLE.
Right hip with staples, mildly tender to palpation.
Discharge exam: VITALS: 96.9F, BP 174/72, HR 72, RR 18, Sat 95%RA Lungs: Bilateral rales at bases Heart: Regular rate and rhythm Abdomen: Benign Extremities: 1+ pitting edema bilaterally Neuro:  CN 2-12 intact.
Bilateral lobar and segmental PE, without evidence of right heart strain.
Pulmonary edema with evolving infarcts.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST IMPRESSION: No acute changes.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS IMPRESSION: Clot within the left posterior tibial vein.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST: HISTORY: Known bilateral PEs with 16-point hematocrit drop after initiating heparin.
No evidence of retroperitoneal bleeding.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and ground-glass opacity with septal thickening, unchanged.
Bilateral renal hypodensities, some of which are too small to  characterize, others of which may represent simple cysts.
Left adrenal gland thickening.
IVC filter placement.
Fibroid uterus.
Slight asymmetrical enlargement of the right anterior thigh musculature with vague hyperdensity which may suggest small amount of intramuscular bleeding.
Diffuse anasarca.
Diffuse anasarca.
Widespread parenchymal opacities are present but improved since the prior study.
Subpleural interstitial changes are noted and are most likely consistent with chronic interstitial changes rather than acute infection, and as was mentioned, improved compared to the prior images.
No focal consolidations to suggest new infection are currently demonstrated, but given the two-week interval compared to the prior imaging, cannot be entirely excluded.
No increase in pleural effusion is demonstrated.
No substantial evidence for failure is seen.
Hip X-ray [**2128-3-8**]: IMPRESSION: Fixation of right femoral subcapital fracture with unchanged alignment.
Brief Hospital Course: 73yF with history of rheumatoid arthritis, breast cancer, recent right hip fracture s/p ORIF and presumed NSTEMI during hospitalization, presented with altered mental status and hypoxia from rehab, found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism, possible pneumonia, and a UTI.
Hospitalization was complicated by recurrent drops in her hematocrit, initially thought to be [**1-13**] to hemolysis, but was subsequently noted to have an upper GI bleed [**1-13**] to a large duodenal ulcer.
Following admission, she was found to have a very rapid HCT drop of unclear source (16 points within 11 hours).
CT scans were without evidence of any significant bleed.
Hemolysis labs were sent, with very low haptoglobin, elevated LDH.
Hematology was consulted, however it remained unclear why she had her sudden HCT drop, but there was likely a contribution of pulmonary infarct and infection driving anemia, based upon findings of toxic granulations on smear.
Once her HCT was reasonably stable, but she was noted to have a slight decline in her hematocrit in the setting of dark guaiac positive stools.
The patient underwent EGD and colonscopy several days after initiation of a PPI that revealed a large duodenal ulcer that was likely the source of bleeding.
The ulcer was shallow, without a visible vessel, and was thought the  be low risk for bleeding.
#) Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient was noted to be markedly volume overloaded and anasarcic; furosemide was increased to 20mg IV BID, which should be continued until diffuse edema resolves.
Pt had a leukocytosis during the admission due to UTI and pulmonary infarcts.
It was thought that pt may possibly have a pneumonia, but this was thought to be less likely.
Her urine grew Enterobacter and Enterococcus.
Wound care was consulted and wound care should be continued: Mepilex and DuoDerm wound gel, along with pressure redistribution guidelines.
#) Diabetes mellitus uncontrolled with complications.
Held oral hypoglycemics while in the hospital and covered with insulin sliding scale and diabetic diet.
#) Rheumatoid arthritis.
Methotrexate was discontinued last admission secondary to pancytopenia.
Continued metoprolol (home medication, increased dose to 25mg [**Hospital1 **]), lisinopril changed to hydralazine/isosorbide inhouse given mild acute renal failure.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
Percocet 2.5-325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every [**5-18**] hours as needed for pain: HOLD for any CNS or respiratory depression (RR <12).
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
