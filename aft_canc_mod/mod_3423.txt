Per PCP note, pt has had increasing "moans", SOB, and abd pain/distension over past week, which is a change from baseline.
She was seen by psychiatry at NH, who questioned psychotic depression and started Seroquel and Paxil.
Pt also had non-contrast Abd CT at [**Hospital1 882**] on [**3-1**], which reportedly showed "no acute process."
She had CXR on [**3-1**] which showed "interval improvement" of bilateral opacities.
Per the pt's daughter, pt had pneumonia in [**1-9**] and has had gradually decreasing function since then.
The daughter also reports pt's mental status has decreased significantly over the past week.
R arm contracture has also occurred over the past several weeks, however the daughter is unsure of the cause.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to have a PNA on CXR and was started on BiPAP for hypercarbic resp failure.
Her BP initially was up to 206/88, but this decreased without antihypertensive therapy.
Past Medical History: 1)Primary intermedullary ependymoma/astrocytoma, spinal cord tumor (in the process of being worked up per daughter, s/p XRT and steroid taper at [**Hospital1 2025**], oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] 2)Remote hx of brain tumor s/p VP shunt placement 3)h/o thoracic aneurysm 4)s/p recent PNA 5)COPD 6)CHF (unknown EF) 7)MVR (bioprosthetic MV) 8)Atrial fibrillation (on coumadin) 9)dementia 10)h/o urinary retention (had foley cath at rehab)  Social History: Lives at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
JVD approximately to earlobe Cardio: irregularly irregular, 2/6 SEM @ apex Resp: diffuse exp wheezes bilaterally (although difficult to discern from pt making "squeeking" noises while exhaling) Abd: soft, nt, mildly distended, +BS, no rebound/guarding Ext: trace BL LE edema.
Knows she is in "hospital", but unable to speak further due to agitation and BiPAP machine.

Likely small bilateral pleural effusions.
2)CT abdomen/pelvis ([**3-4**]): 1.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Bibasilar consolidation, likely atelectasis, although evolving infection cannot be entirely excluded.
Moderate right and small left pleural effusion.
Coronary artery calcifications.
Multiple hepatic cysts.
Sigmoid diverticula without evidence of diverticulitis  3)CT Head ([**3-6**]): Limited study due to motion.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
No mass effect.
No evidence of dilatation of the ventricles.
4)Abdomen xray ([**3-10**]): No evidence of obstruction.
Minimal aortic stenosis with mild regurgitation.
Normally-functioning mitral bioprosthesis.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Airspace opacity of the dependent bilateral lower lobes is thought more likely to represent atelectasis; however, underlying infection cannot be definitively excluded.
Small right pleural effusion and minimal left pleural effusion.
Multiple well-defined hypodense foci scattered throughout the liver, the larger of which are consistent with cysts.
Several smaller lesions are too small to definitively characterize.
Numerous sigmoid diverticula without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
Previously reported pulmonary edema has slightly progressed with increased perihilar haziness.
Bilateral pleural effusions are present, best visualized on the lateral view, small in size.
Discharge labs: [**2191-3-23**] 08:21AM BLOOD WBC-8.4 RBC-2.89* Hgb-9.2* Hct-28.2* MCV-98 MCH-31.9 MCHC-32.7 RDW-15.9* Plt Ct-377 [**2191-3-24**] 05:28AM BLOOD PT-16.0* PTT-29.5 INR(PT)-1.5* [**2191-3-23**] 08:21AM BLOOD Glucose-107* UreaN-14 Creat-0.6 Na-141 K-3.7 Cl-104 HCO3-33* AnGap-8  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 72408**] is a 79 yo female with COPD, dementia, here with PNA, hypercarbic respiratory failure, abd pain, and abnormal EKG.
1) Respiratory failure: Patient presented with respiratory acidosis and was admitted to the MICU for closer monitoring.
Respiratory decompensation likely occurred in the setting of pneumonia seen on cxray, COPD, and CHF exacerbation.
Her oxygen saturations improved with antibiotics and agressive diuresis.
2)Abdominal pain: Patient presented with several week history of diffuse abdominal pain.
All imaging studies, including CT scan abdomen/pelvis, were negative for acute pathology that could explain her symptoms.
Lactate was normal and guiac negative suggestive of mesenteric ischemia being unlikely.
Her abdominal pain and distention improved following bowel movements.
3)Elevated troponins/EKG changes: Patient presented with mildly elevated troponins and diffuse ST depressions in the anterolateral leads.
Likely demand ischemia given respiratory distress and underlying infection.
Given patient's persistent abdominal pain, it was thought that this may be an anginal equivalent.
There were no new wall motion abnormalities on both ECHOs.
She did have significant LVH with hyperdynamic EF~70-80's.
Verapamil was changed to Metoprolol, per cardiology recommendation, as a result of increasing abdominal pain and distention.
Her INR became supratherapeutic to >6 at which point her coumadin was held for one dose and she was given vitamin K.  Her INR then became subtherapeutic and her coumadin was continued.
Her INR on the day of discharge was 1.5  5)Hypertension: Patient presented with SBP in 200's on admission but quickly returned to baseline.
6) Delirium/Dementia/agitation: Per patient's daughter, she has had an acute decline in her mental status over past several weeks.
She was initially started on Quetiapine and Lorazepam but given the increased sedative effects of the quetiapine this medication was stopped.
She was continued on Ativan prn and her mental status contineud to wax and wane throughout her hospital stay likely from her comorbidities.
The etiology of her delirium was thought to be multifactorial with a prolonged hospital stay and significant comorbitities contributing.
She remained afebrile with a stable WBC count so infection was thought not to be contributing.
She was evaluated by psychiatry given her delirium and history of depression and they recommended seroquel 12.5 mg tid prn for anxiety/agitation.
She received XRT in [**Month (only) 404**] and was supposed to undergo a repeat MRI of her C-spine.
8) FEN: NGT was initially placed since patient had poor mental status.
She was evalauted by speech and swallow who determined that she could tolerate a regular diet without signs of aspiration.
9) Sacral decubitus ulcer: patient was evaluated by wound care nurse who recommended dressing changes every 2-3 days with following protocol: clean with commercial cleanser, pat dry, apply protective barrier wipe to periwound tissue, apply duoderm gel, cover with Allevyn Foam adhesive 5x5".
There was no sign of infection at the site.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Suppository Rectal DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Quetiapine 25 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: 0.5 Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for anxiety/agitation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - LTC  Discharge Diagnosis: MRSA pneumonia COPD Atrial fibrillation Constipation Sacral decubitus ulcer CHF Dementia/delirium   Discharge Condition: Afebrile.
If you experience difficulty breathing, chest pain, inability to eat, high fevers or other concerning symptoms, please call your doctor or come to the emergency room.
