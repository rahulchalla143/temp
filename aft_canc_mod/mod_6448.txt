He reported worsening shortness of breath, and frustration at the prospect of transfer to the ICU.
He denies chest pain, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.
He has no strength or sensation in his legs, and cannot move them.
Also endorses chronic back pain that is at its baseline.
Otherwise denies fever, chills, night sweats, cough, chest pressure, dysuria, urinary frequency or urgency.
Oncologic history (per BMT notes):  Patient reports being diagnosed with multiple myeloma after he presented to an outside hospital [**2109-3-11**] with bilateral lower extremity pain, weakness and fatigue, renal dysfunction and confusion.
Patient has had a significant decrease in paraprotein, normalization of plasma cells in marrow and improvement in disease on imaging.
During this hospitalization, in addition to the above spinal imaging, he also received a CT of his chest, which revealed multiple pulmonary nodules, concerning for metastatic disease   Past Medical History: - Multiple hospitalizations in Spring [**2110**]  -hospitalized from [**Date range (1) 88502**] at [**Last Name (un) 1724**] with shingles requiring high dose acyclovir and analgesia, as well as PNA with resultant bandemia and hypotension requiring ICU admission, treated with 5 days vanco and azithromycin, and seven days pip/tazo  -hospitalized at [**Last Name (un) 1724**] [**Date range (1) 88503**], with E coli, PCP and [**Date range (1) 1074**] pneumonia; was initially treated with Bactrim, but experienced thrombocytopenia and was switched to atovaquone - DVTs status post IVC filter placement - HTN - HL - Disc herniation with sciatica - CAD, s/p stent x2 - Hypothyroidism - Prior R rotator cuff repair - R knee arthroscopic surgery - Appendectomy age 17   Social History: +1-1.5 PPD since age 15.

------ ------ IMAGING:  [**8-7**] Renal Doppler FINDINGS: The exam is somewhat limited due to patient's intubated status and inability to breath-hold.
The left main renal artery shows a normal-appearing waveform with a peak velocity of 63 cm/sec.
IMPRESSION: Patent renal arterial and venous vasculature as described above with normal resistive indices.
RIB UNILAT, W/ AP CHEST LEFT [**8-4**] There are patchy opacities throughout both lungs.
No left-sided rib fracture is detected.
No focal lytic or sclerotic rib lesion is identified.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>65%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
No definite valvular dysfunction identified.
LENI [**7-10**]: CONCLUSION: Intraluminal thrombus is noted in one of the brachial veins, the one lying more anteriorly.
Proximal subclavian vein shows minimal flow.
Left internal jugular, axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins appear patent.
LENI [**7-25**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT within the right upper extremity veins.
Differential diagnosis is broad and includes infection, vasculitis, and lung involvement of myeloma.
Extensive lymphadenopathy .
Epidural mass better seen in prior MR [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 767**] [**7-5**].
Multiple bilateral pulmonary lesions are slightly decreased in size but show new evidence of cavitation, concerning for septic emboli or infection with an organism such as Nocardia or pseudomonas.
Additional new ground-glass opacities predominantly in the upper lobes, right greater than left, are also concerning for infection, although asymmetric pulmonary edema could also have this appearance.
New tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities in the right lower lobe are concerning for aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia.
Diffuse lymphadenopathy and soft tissue nodules within the mediastinum, parasternal region, posterior cervical region, retroperitoneum, pelvis, and gluteal region, as described above.
These lesions are consistent with extraosseous involvement of multiple myeloma, an uncommon manifestation of the disease described in an article from AJR dated from [**2103**] (183:929-932).
Diffuse metastatic disease involving the axial skeleton, as described on MR [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 767**] [**2110-7-5**].
A mid thoracic paraspinal/epidural mass causes compression of the spinal cord, most significant at T5, not appreciably changed compared to the prior study.
Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 5.9 cm.
Progression of right basilar tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities with new areas of consolidation at both bases.
Progression of ground-glass opacities in the left and right upper lobes.
These findings are concerning for progressive infectious process.
Several pulmonary lesions again seen with evidence of cavitation concerning for septic emboli or infection with Nocardia or Pseudomonas.
Diffuse lymphadenopathy and soft tissue nodules within the mediastinum, parasternal region, posterior cervical soft tissue nodules.
These lesions are consistent with extraosseous involvement of multiple myeloma.
Mid thoracic paraspinal mass again seen, better evaluated on MRI.
Spine MRI - multiple studies, see OMR  Brief Hospital Course: Prior to patient's ICU courses, the patient underwent laminectomy x2 and hemilaminectomy x2 and he was subsequently transferred to the BMT unit for further management of his multiple myeloma.
61 y/o M with past multiple myeloma treated with chemo and XRT, multiple hospital admissions for pneumonia in recent months, now admitted on [**7-5**] for lower extremity paralysis related to spinal cord involvement, c/b upper extremity DVT, and newly found lung nodules concerning for malignancy, now s/p biopsy.
Initially on Ortho Spine [**Hospital 81944**] transferred to BMT floor following post-operative stabilization, then transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and bloody stools.
He had an acute drop in his hematocrit with dysphagia and guaiac positive stool.
GI was consulted and performed upper endoscopy and capsule endoscopy, neither of which revealed active bleed.
He developed asymmetric left hand weakness, was seen by neurology, and underwent MRI of brachial plexus and cervical spine, showing posterior fluid collection between C5-T2.
He had a CT chest on [**7-17**], which showed diffuse peribronchovacular GGO's, signs of aspiration, and increased bilateral lymphadenopathy.
Concurrent abdominal imaging also revealed a 5.8cm infrarenal AAA.
Readmitted to ICU on [**7-24**] for persistent hypoxia and ongoing GI bleed.
# Hypoxemia: Pt has had multiple recent admissions with various pulmonary infections, but on admission was not demonstrating septic physiology or signs of severe systemic infection.
Multiple chest imaging studies were obtained, as follows: CXR showed new lower lobe opacity with concern for new bacterial lobar pneumonia vs aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.
CT chest showed nodules concerning for malignancy, but this likely an indolent process which would not account for abrupt worsening of oxygenation over 12 hour course.
He underwent a lung nodule biopsy which showed focal organizing pneumonitis, chronic inflammation, and non-necrotizing granulomas.
Additional CT finding of ground-glass opacities c/f PNA improved on more recent CT. Pt is at risk for PE with known DVTs, hematologic malignancy, & recent interruption in systemic anticoagulation for lung biopsy; heparin was started but stopped when the pt developed dropping Hct with guaiac positive stools suspicious for GI bleed (see below).
Bronchioalveolar lavage and sputum cultures were negative including AFB, [**Month/Year (2) 1074**], and PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 151**] the exception of one BAL culture which grew yeast after 5 days.
#GI bleed Pt suffered a 6-point Hct drop during first ICU admission -- suspected source was upper GI bleed given coincident melanotic stools.
Other possibilities considered and ruled out included: retroperitoneal bleed (negative CT Abdomen), bleeding into or rupture of pre-existing 5.8cm AAA (asymptomatic, vital signs stable), or bleed into recent spinal surgical site (surgical site appeared non-concerning).
Pt underwent capsule endoscopy, which showed multiple non-bleeding angioectasias throughout the small bowel but no evidence of active bleeding.
# Spinal cord compression/paralysis: S/p laminectomy x2 and hemilaminectomy x2, without subsequent improvement in extremity strength/sensation.
Orthospine service monitored the patient in the ICU; staples were removed and post-surgical site appeared clean.
Radiation oncology evaulated the patient for XRT to palliate pain and  prevent loss of or even improve some neurological function of the LUE.
At time of transfer he was on a dexamethaxone taper with dilaudid PCA for pain management.
# DVTs: Pt has lower extremity DVTs diagnosed at [**Last Name (un) 1724**] last month plus upper extremity DVT in the LUE involving the subclavian, earlier on this admission.
Deferred decision on chronic anticoagulation until GI w/u complete, including possible evaluation for intracranial metastases.
CBC/diff not concerning for acute myeloma, and SPEP showing hypogammaglobulinemia except normal IgA level.
Has elevated free kappa light chains in serum, consistent with prior IgA kappa MM.
Given concern for metastases to spinal cord and pulmonary nodules, pt was prepped twice for radiation therapy; the first time he was unable to tolerate lying flat due to respiratory distress.
# Leukocytosis: Patient developed elevated WBC to 33.8 in the ICU.
Considered infectious process vs post-operative vs leukemoid reaction from glucocorticoids.
Steroid reponse most likely but persistent bands on diff (3% today) suggests possible ongoing infectious process.
# CAD: Developed CP in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
ECG without ischemic changes.
# Hypertension: Stable BP in ICU, mildly hypotensive while sleeping on floor, but improves when awakened.
61 y/o M with PMH as above, transferred back to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from BMT service for recurrent GI bleed.
At this discussion, the decision was made to transition the patient to DNR/DNI status with no further escalation in care.
# GI bleed: Transferred from BMT unit for melanotic stool and tachycardia with a Hct 21, requiring 3U PRBC on the day of transfer to maintain Hct >25.
Pt required intubation for push enteroscopy which did not identify any bleeding source.
# Hypoxemia: After transfer back to the ICU he was found to have a significant A-a gradient on ABG.
No evidence of right heart strain on EKG.
At high risk for PE given immobility, known DVTs in multiple extremities, and active malignancy.
Acute onset of hypoxia was suggestive of vascular event.
Unfortunately, ability to treat suspected PE by anticoagulation was limited by ongoing GI bleed.
Other possible explanations for initial hypoxemia included infectious process, pulmonary edema, or transfusion-related pulmonary process given the numerous blood product transfusions he required for his ongoing GI bleed.
Initial CXR showed no infiltrate and pt was afebrile.
However, CT chest showed progression of right basilar tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities with new areas of consolidation at both bases, progression of ground-glass opacities in the left and right upper lobes, and several progressively cavitating parenchymal lesions concerning for septic emboli, Nocardia, Pseudomonas or Tuberculosis.
He was also continued on Voriconazole for yeast+ sputum cultures; this was transiently changed to micofungin but changed back to voriconazole when patient's respiratory status further deteriorated after the GI procedure.
Studies were also negative for the PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1074**] (and other viral studies); given acyclovir-induced crystal nephropathy was within the differential when the patient became anuric (see below), acyclovir was also stopped when tests returned negative.
Following the procedure he had persistent respiratory acidosis and was not able to be extubated.
Maintained primarily on pressure support ventilation; took in large tidal volumes with some improvement in his acidosis.
He had recurrent fever to 102-103, non-responsive to tylenol.
#Acure Renal Failure: Patient became acutely anuric with an elevated serum creatinine.
Sediment showed muddy-brown casts c/w ATN.
Other possible diagnoses, per Renal, are various types of "obstructive uropathy" including myeloma cast nephropathy and acute acyclovir crystallopathy.
Renal U/S showed no hydronephrosis.
He also received significant albumin load via multiple blood product transfusions during this time.
However, his mental status gradually declined such that he did not require sedation on the vent, and on examination was unresponsive and unable to follow commands.
Melanotic stools and dropping Hct continued to require blood and platelet transfusion.
All pain and sedating medications were held.
All meds were checked for renal dosing and non-essential medications were stopped, including empiric TB antibiotics (AFB negative smears x3).
No improvement in mental, respiratory, or renal status.
# Multiple myeloma: Previously started bortezomib therapy and had completed XRT.
UPEP was sent, showed trace monoclonal free Bence-[**Doctor Last Name **] Kappa detected and additional monoclonal IgA Kappa Bence-[**Doctor Last Name **] now representing 4% of urinary protein.
Underwent U/S guided excisional biopsy.
Hematopathology examination showed a mass of plasma cells with necrosis.. .
# DVT: Unable to treat multiple known thromboses given active GI bleed requiring RBC transfusions.
Of note, the patient does have an IVC filter in place.
# Spinal cord mets s/p decompressive laminectomies: Path consistent with plasma cell metastases.
Left with flaccid paralysis on bilateral lower extremities, although has some residual sensation.
# CAD: Patient c/o left-sided CP not associated with SOB and without radiation.
No ischemic changes were seen on ECG.
Patient underwent left-sided rib films as patient's pain was reproducible with palpation.
Rib series showed no fractures, focal or sclerotic lesions.
Pt developed hypoglycemia to 40s, which started while NPO prior to GI procedure.
Received D50 as needed for hypoglycemia.
