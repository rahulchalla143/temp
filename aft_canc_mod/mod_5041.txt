Tissue biopsy   History of Present Illness: 73 year-old righ handed male who has noiced blurry vision on the left visual field while doing his crossword puzzle and playing golf.His visual problem got worse over time MRI -/+ gadolinium in [**Hospital1 756**] and [**Hospital 63531**] Hospital [**2125-7-21**] showed an enhancing mass in the optic chiasm and the right optic nerve.
There was a spot of enhancement as well as T2 and FL IR hyoerdensities in the left cereberal peduncleand left insula.
After long discussion with patient benefits, risk of surgery by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] patient and family decided to have an elective surgery.
SKIN:good turgor tonus, no ecchymosis.
CVS: RRR, S1/S2, No M/G/R.
There is no afferent pupillary defect.
Visual field examination shows a left hemianopsia in OS and a left upper quadrantaposia in OD.
Motor Examination: He does not have a drift.
He does not have a Romberg.
Pertinent Results: [**2125-8-16**] GLUCOSE-167* UREA N-28* CREAT-0.8 SODIUM-133 POTASSIUM-4.3 CHLORIDE-102 TOTAL CO2-22 ANION GAP-13 [**2125-8-16**]   CALCIUM-7.0* PHOSPHATE-3.5 MAGNESIUM-1.8 [**2125-8-16**]  WBC-14.0* RBC-4.38* HGB-13.5* HCT-40.6 MCV-93 MCH-30.8 MCHC-33.3 RDW-13.4 [**2125-8-16**]   PLT COUNT-117* [**2125-8-16**] PT-12.7 PTT-21.0* INR(PT)-1.1  Head MRI;[**2125-7-21**] Showed an enhancing lesion in the right optic nerve, right optic tract, and the optic chiasm.
There was also an enhancing spot in the left parietal white matter, as well as increase FLAIR and T2 signals in the left cerebral peduncle and the left insula.
EEG: [**2125-8-20**] Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the persistent and somewhat rhythmic bursts of slowing with some sharp features broadly over the right hemisphere.
This suggests a focal subcortical abnormality, likely of a structural or distructive nature.
The rhythmic appearance of slowing and occasional sharp features raises concern for the possibility of lateralized epileptogenesis, but there were no clear seizures during the recording.
Tissu Pathology ; [**2125-8-16**] #1, OPTIC TRACK LESION BIOPSY (including intraoperative smear):  ANAPLASTIC ASTROCYTOMA with gemistocytic features.
Brief Hospital Course: 73 year-old male underwent right craniotomy for resection of right optic track glioma, and tissue biopsy  under general anesthesia on [**8-16**]/5.No intraoperative complications occurred.
Postop  Head MRI with/without gadolinium revealed status post craniotomy, mass in the optic chiasm is visualized.
No evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect or hydrocephalus.
Signal abnormalities in the brain stem and left insular region.
No evidence of acute infarct.
Patient developed hyponatremia on POD#3, Na 121, started 3% sodioum IV fluid restriction initiated and salt tabs able to normolize sodium level.On [**8-24**] Na:132 borderline low, continue fluid restriction to 1000ml a day.
Advanced his diet as tolareted, able to void without any difficulty.POD#5 ([**8-20**]) Patient had a whitnessed seizure activity by staff, potable EEG showed abnormal EEG, dilantin 1 gm load then, 100mg TID started.Dilantin 7.6 [**8-22**], [**8-23**] Dilantin level 18 on current dose.Reloaded and dose increased to 200mg [**Hospital1 **].
On [**2125-8-23**] on morning rounds patient was slow to respond on neuro exam , repeated Head CT was stable, later in the day neuro exam was better.
Spiked a low grade fever 101 pan cultures obtained.
Urine dipsitick showed trace blood, tr ketone, tarce protein, glucose 250, urobil: 12, no leukocit.
Report fever greater than 101, chills, seizure activity or any other neurologic sypmtoms.
