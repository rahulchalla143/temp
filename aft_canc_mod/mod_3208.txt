intake secondary to decreased appetite.
She denied bright red blood per rectum but had black tarry stools which she thought was secondary to her iron supplement tabs.
Her pain was mainly in her right lower quadrant without radiation.
Abdominal CT scan on [**4-1**] showed a 3-4 cm mass in her ascending colon.
The patient was guaiac positive in an apple-core lesion in the descending colon with pin-hole size lumen, as well as diverticulosis and descending colon polyps.
Biopsy of the lesion revealed invasive adenocarcinoma in the ascending colon.
Echocardiogram in [**2143-12-29**] showed an ejection fraction of 75-80%, concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, and mitral regurgitation.
The patient has had dyspnea on exertion and chest heaviness for the past few years.
Persantine study showed large anterior wall reversible defect on [**2144-4-6**].
The patient had another echocardiogram on [**2144-4-6**], which showed mild aortic stenosis and an aortic valve area of 1.1 cm.
Coronary artery disease.
History of breast cancer status post bilateral mastectomy.
Aortic stenosis.
Spinal stenosis status post back surgery.
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a widow and lives alone and performs all activities of daily living independently.
General:  She was a pleasant woman, looking than her stated age in no acute distress.
There was a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border.
There was mild right lower quadrant tenderness.
No rebound or guarding.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm, 80 beats per minute, right bundle branch block, first degree AV block, Q-waves in II, III, and AVF, T-wave inversion in V1 and V2 with no ST elevations or depressions.
Echocardiogram on [**4-6**] at the outside hospital was with mild aortic stenosis with valve area of 1.17 mm, normal left ventricular function.
Carotid ultrasound done at the outside hospital showed no significant stenosis.
Cardiology consult was obtained, and a repeat echocardiogram was performed which showed left ventricle with mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, ejection fraction greater than 55%, aorta with trace regurgitation, aortic valve and mitral valve with 1+ mitral regurgitation, mild to moderate aortic stenosis, and a ventricular inflow pattern suggestive of impaired relaxation and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
A stress test was also obtained that was performed with a ................... injection where the patient had no anginal symptoms or ischemic electrocardiogram changes.
Nuclear scan showed no myocardial perfusion defects to suggest ischemia and an ejection fraction of 89%.
Cardiology suggested were to use perioperative beta-blocker, and the patient was started on Lopressor, as well as postoperative cardiac enzymes and electrocardiogram.
At that time on [**4-10**], a PICC line was placed for TPN and preoperative, as well as postoperative nutrition.
Estimated blood loss was minimal.
Intraoperatively the patient had a right CVL placed, and chest x-ray was performed postoperatively which showed no pneumothorax.
The patient had no electrocardiogram changes or complaints of any chest pain, and ischemic cardiac event was unlikely.
intake secondary to no appetite but had no complaints of nausea or vomiting.
She had no focal neurological deficits.
CBC was with a slightly elevated white count of 13.
The episode of this delirium was of unclear etiology but was improved without any specific therapy.
Cecal Colon cancer 2.
Aortic Valve Stenosis 3.
Hypertension 4.
