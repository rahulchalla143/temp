Admission Date:  [**2122-7-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-7-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2058-8-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Percocet / Shellfish Derived / Levaquin  Attending:[**Known firstname 3326**] Chief Complaint: fevers and sob x 5 days  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**7-16**]: Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 63 yo M with NSCLC and CLL who originally p/w 5 days of fever and SOB.
He initially went to [**Location (un) 620**] on [**7-8**] for symptoms of shortness of breath and was given a course of levoquin.
He reports that he developed a pruritic truncal rash while on the levaquin (thus it was discontinued on initial presentation to [**Hospital1 18**]).
At home however, even while on the levaquin, he continued to be SOB and was febrile to 100.5 x 3 days PTA.
Prior to that, cough was productive of moderate amounts of yellow sputum.
On admission, CXR revealed b/l hazy opacities.
He was initially started on cefepime/vanco/flagyl/bactrim for pulomonary infection unresponsive to levofloxacin.
He was previously requiring O2 via nasal cannula to max of 4L, but since yesterday evening, has had increasing oxygen requirement overnight so that he was placed on a NRB.
He has had multiple coughing fits with posttussive emesis at which time he desaturates to the 80s.
A CT scan was obtained today given his broad coverage, but persistent respiratory decompensation which showed b/l consolidations and ground glass opacities.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 15250**] the day, he became increasingly tachypneic to RR as high as 40s and although, recent ABG revealed 7.44/37/141, he looked to be tiring with use of accessory respiratory muscles and was transferred to the ICU for further respiratory monitoring and out of concern for possible need for intubation.

Past Medical History: # Adenocarcinoma of the lung/ Large cell lung cancer - diagnosed left [**2112**], right [**2118**], s/p wedge resection and RLL lobectomy.
previously treated with Taxol/Cisplatin, Tarceva, and now Navelbine x8 # CLL # CAD s/p 3v CABG [**11/2115**] # COPD # s/p inguinal hernia repair   Social History: live swith wife.
smoking 30yrs x 1-1.5ppd; quit [**2113-1-18**]; EtOH: rare; Illicits: none   Family History: Mother died of breast cancer 66yrs, Brother w/ h/o CAD  Physical Exam: Vitals: T 96.2  HR 104  BP 110/59  RR 37  O2sat 90-98% NRB General:  pale male, appears short of breath with NRB mask in place using accessory neck and abdominal muscles to breath, is however, able to complete full sentences, but appears tired.
HEENT:  PERRL, OP clear, mildy dry MM Neck:  supple CV:  tachycardic, prominent heart sounds, no murmurs appreciated Lungs: Decreased breath sounds throughout right lung, specifically right base, Left lung w/ decreased BS apically and with crackles from mid lung to base.
Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, +BS Ext:  1+ b/l LE edema, feet cool w/ palpable DP/PT pulses Neuro:  CN 2-12, strength, sensation grossly intact  Pertinent Results: Imaging: [**2122-7-8**] CXR ([**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]) - Increased density in the R  lung suspicous for PNA.
Persistent focal areas of increased density n the lateral aspect of the lower right lung and in the left perihiklar region may represent residual or current tumor.
Micro: [**2122-7-13**] Blood - pending [**2122-7-15**] sputum - GPC in pairs and clusters .
BAL [**2122-7-16**]: + malignant cells c/w NSCLC adenocarcinoma; no viral agents, legionella, pcp, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] afb growth to date .
[**2122-7-14**] Chest CT: Interval progression of dense left perihilar and right posterior  lung consolidation with numerous new bilateral small areas of consolidation and diffuse ground-glass opacity.
As was described in the past report, differential diagnosis for the chronic consolidation would include bronchoalveolar carcinoma or cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
The interval progression of consolidation in these two areas could at least in part represent progression of one of these processes with possible superimposed infectious pneumonia.
Primary considerations for the multifocal new areas of consolidation also includes acute infectious process.
Other considerations that would account for the diffuse ground-glass opacity would include hypersensitivity pneumonitis, drug reaction, or hydrostatic pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 63yo M with h/o NSCLC, CLL, and CAD p/w fevers and shortness of breath x 5 days with worsening hypoxia despite broad coverage antibiotics.
# Hypoxia:  CT scan shows increased lung consolidation and diffuse ground glass opacities.
In review of most recent chest CT in [**3-/2122**], appears to have worsening disease concerning for progression of lung cancer.
Ground glass opacities concerning for superimposed infection and even postobstructive pneumonia given progression of disease.
Additionally, WBC count difficult to follow as indicator of infection due to CLL.
Alimta is most recent therapeutic oncologic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] and does not appear to have increased risk of pneumonitis nor is there other clear medications cause of pneumonitis.
Despite ABG without significant derangements, had increased WOB w/ accessory muscle use and tachypnea on transfer concerning that the patient would tire.
Had episode of desat to 80s with increased WOB secondary to likely mucus plugging as he improved s/p expectoration of small amount of blood-tinged sputum.
Broad coverage antibiotics were continued with cefepime/vancomycin/ flagyl/ and voriconazole as per ID recs with azithromycin for atypical coverage.
Due to poor respiratory status the patient was intubated on [**2122-7-17**].
# NSCLC: CT scan showed what appears to be progression of disease with consolidation secondary to pneumonia.
The team had been in touch with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] (outpt oncologist) regarding rec's, and it was felt that there were no further treatment options to treat his underlying disease.
# Hemoptysis:  Most likely secondary to underlying infective process vs. progression of pulmonary oncologic process.
# CLL:  Again, status of disease was not entirely clear, but certainly lung ca is more active issue currently given advancement of disease.
# CAD:  s/p CABG in [**2114**].
On statin alone, not on ASA (unclear reason, but potentially while undergoing tx) nor BB ([**1-16**] to hypotension in past).
No active issues currently.
# Anemia:  baseline appears to fluctuate some but hct appears mainly high 20s to mid 30s with nml MCV and elevated RDW.
This was monitored, with benadryl as needed for pruritus .
On [**2122-7-18**] am pt had an episode of bradycardic arrest with loss of pulse for 30-60seconds.
EKG showed RBBB with sinus tachycardia in 140s.
Etiology was unclear: perhaps vagal episode from ETT tube, but this appears to be  unlikely given proper placement on CXR.
EKG not consistent with inferior infarct.
At ~3:30pm the patient became bradycardic again.
The patient continued to become bradycardic with decrease in respiratory rate until cardiopulmonary arrest.
