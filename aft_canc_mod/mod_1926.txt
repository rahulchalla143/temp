Has history of lower GI bleed x 2 in the past, most recently in [**2196**] [**2-11**] diverticulitis, as well as a duodenal ulcer that was apparently in the setting of NSAID use.
Does take aspirin but no additional anticoagulation.
General surgery felt that a diverticular bleed was most likely, and recommended colonoscopy to find a source.
On arrival to the ICU, she denies lightheadedness, abdominal pain or further bowel movements.

Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] yo female w/ PMH HTN, DM2, nephrotic-range proteinuria and an enlarging renal mass suspicious for malignancy, here with BRBPR likely [**2-11**] diverticulosis as documented on colonoscopy in [**2196**].
# BRBPR.
Most likely lower GI source given extensive prior diverticulosis and negative lavage on repeat.
Patient was admitted to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring.
GI evalauted her and offered a colonoscopy to look for source of bleed and to rule out a malignancy.
She did not get colonoscopy while in the MICU because of hemodynamic stability and also she stated that she would not want to have colonoscopy or any surgery.
This was confirmed multiple times and patient and son both repeated that she would not want a colonoscopy in the event of a repeat bleeding episode.
ASA held in event of recent bleed and can be restarted as needed by PCP should she continue to be stable, without more bleeding.
Hct continued to be stable and patient had no further bleeding.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: patient has had worsening renal failure over several months.
Likely pre-renal vs worsening chronic renal failure in setting of enlarging left kidney mass.
FeNa 1.3 and proteinuria has actually improved since hr last admission.
# Hypertension.
# Elevated Lipase: patient without n/v or abdominal pain, remained persistently elevated while in the ICU.
# Code: DNR/DNI, would not want heroic measures or invasive procedures (discussed with patient and son [**Doctor First Name **] .

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Healthcare Center - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Lower GI bleed, likely [**2-11**] known diverticulosis acute on chronic renal failure  Secondary: hypertension glaucoma osteoarthritis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Given your clinical presentation and previous colonoscopy and history of diverticulosis, the most likely cause of your bleeding is the diverticulosis (out-pouching/polyps in the colon).
We understand your wish for repeat colonoscopy refusal and have provided supportive care.
