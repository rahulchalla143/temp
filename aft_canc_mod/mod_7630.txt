There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Quantitative (biplane) LVEF = 21%.
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No vegetations or clinically-significant regurgitant valvular disease seen (good-quality study).
Severe global left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Brief Hospital Course: 56 y/o woman with CLL s/p 4 cycles of [**Hospital1 **] treatment on Neupogen s/p febrile neutropenia and septic shock requiring [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay, [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course described below per day:  In the ED T 102.9, P170, BP 113/65, 100% on RA.
Her blood cultures grew Klebsiella on [**2129-2-24**].
In addition, a new echo was done which demonstrated LVEF of 21% with severe global left ventricular systolic dysfunction, a deterioration from echo on [**2129-2-11**].
also had episodes of hematochezia and dropped to 24.3 on [**2-26**], GI consulted and concluded that bleeding is likely from polyp documented on previous colonoscopy, deferred colonoscopy to outpatient setting unless bleeding increases.
In addition had asymptomatic episodes of brady to 40, sinus w/ no evidence of 1st degree/2nd degree heart block.
[**Hospital Unit Name 13533**] ====================== [**2129-2-25**] -Initially was on three pressors but weaned off over the course of the day with preservation of MAP's >65 -Blood cultures with GNR's, caspofungin discontinued (OK w/ hematology and oncology) -Echo showed new LV dysfunction with LVEF 20% per echo (new since [**2129-2-11**]) -Had hematochezia and AM Hct 24 and Plt 9.
________________________________ [**2129-2-26**] -remains off pressors with stable BP -had multiple episodes bloody diarrhea (marroon, liquidy but not quantified) during the day.
per BMT, consider Plt goal >30, Hct goal >25 -Changed PPI to IV pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **] -Stool culture and C diff sent- considering Shigella or other entero-invasive bacteria causing both bloody diarrhea and bacteremia.
Premedicating before products with tylenol and benadryl so may be missing a fever today with these meds.
-Consider calling GI in am re: possible scope if bloody diarrhea persists.
[**2129-2-27**] -GI: bleeding is likely from polyp documented on previous colonoscopy.
Defer colonoscopy to outpatient setting unless bleeding increases.
-Heme onc: Continue GCSF, give IVIG for sepsis in setting of CLL and hypogammaglobulinemia, aggressive platelet goals given hematochezia w/ plts>50K -Transfused 1 bag platelets -ID: stool studies for salmonella, shigella, e.coli 0157, yersinia; abdominal CT to r/o abscess in setting of GNR sepsis (we didn't order this because of the patient's questionable renal fxn in setting of decreased urine output and b/c our suspicion was low); hold gent until level comes back.
Gent level was 3.9 so gent d/c'd for now before 3rd dose, abdominal CT -d/c'd vancomycin, foley and a. line -Hematochezia decreased in volume and rate -episodes of brady to 40, sinus w/ no evidence of 1st degree/2nd degree heart block, she says she has a history of this, remains asymptomatic (no syncope in past) =================================================  # CLL s/p SCT: Pt.
Patient was having low grade temperatures on two days during her stay on BMT floor and so neupogen was discontinued as possible etiology.
# Pan-Sensitive Klebsiella Bacteremia: Pt.
was discharged with 4 days left on a 14 day course and will follow up each day at the oncology outpatient clinic to receive her daily ceftriaxone injection until [**2129-3-16**] (final day of 14 day course started when patient was no longer neutropenic on [**2129-3-2**]).
# Colonic Polyp: Pt.
with hematochezia and melena requiring transfusions.
The patient was amenable to this plan and was instructed to come into the hospital immediately if she experienced any lightheadedness, or passed an increased amount of blood in her stools.
# New Onset Heart Failure: Pt.
with decreased EF on most recent echo.
Has not been started on any afterload reduction presumably due to hypotension and sepsis.
[**Month (only) 116**] consider starting afterload reduction and possible diuresis once patient is hemodynamically stable, and outpatient echo.
