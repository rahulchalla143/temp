# CAD:  Patient has significant cardiac history with coronary artery dsiease s/p MI complicated by V-fib arres, s/p CABGx4, s/p ICD.
Metoprolol, lisiopril and lasix were initially held due to concern for bleeding causing hypotension and acute renal failure.
# CHF: Patietn has ischemic cardiomyopathy LVEF 10% s/p ICD.
His home dose of metoprolol, lisinopril and lasix were initially held due to concern for blood loss causing hypotension and ARF.
