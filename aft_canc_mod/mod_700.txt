Pt states that she falls "occasionally" at home, and can predict when she does; she associates with having a seizure.
Over the past 4-5 days pt reports not feeling well; first had 2 days of migraines, then during the following days she had persistent n/v, anorexia, and watery diarrhea, several bowel movements per day.
She noted a low grade temp to 99 F four days ago, but has since denied fevers or sick contacts.
She suffered a nosebleed but no LOC.
However, because of persistent hypotension, she eventually received total 9L NS.
Her neck MRI demonstrated a prevertebral fluid collection without enhancement or evidence of fracture.
no cord compresssion appreciated.
Chronic macrocytic anemia w/ mild pancytopenia 2.
Hypothyroidism 4. h/o questionable seizures, but neg 48h EEG and nL MRI in past.
Questionable history of cardiac arrhythmias.
Peptic ulcer disease status post Nissen fundoplication.
Asthma s/p intubation x 1 in past.

Marked diffuse symmetric wall thickening seen throughout the stomach extending into the first portion of the duodenum, likely represents edema.
Small amount of ascites and pelvic free fluid.
Bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions.
No evidence of solid organ injury within the abdomen  ECG: NSR at 60 bpm, nl axis, slightly prolonged QTc  [**10-21**] Cervical MRI: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of cord compression or abnormal signal.
There is no evidence of discitis or epidural abscess.
There is prevertebral fluid accumulation in the upper cervical region.
There is no definite evidence of focal disc protrusion or canal stenosis.
There is no definite evidence of marrow injury.
This could represent an infectious process and abscess formation, although I do not see a great deal of marginal contrast enhancement.
There is no evidence of epidural abscess or discitis.
The collection does not appear to represent blood nor do I see definite evidence of vertebral fracture  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 52 yo F w/ h/o MDS, multiple other medical problems, here w/ hypotension after several days of n/v/d.
Hypotension: We thought that her hypotension was probably secondary to intravascular volume depletion due to several days of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
We also entertained the diagnosis of sepsis but thought that this was less likely since her WBC was normal, she was afebrile and no longer hypotensive.
We did not find evidence for a cardiogenic etiiology of her hypotension since her cardiac enzymes were normal and there were not ECG changes.
The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiey was also considered by her electrolytes were normal making this less likely.
2.Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea:We thought that her GI symptoms may have been secondary to a viral infection as they resolved upon admission and did not recur.
S/p Fall We were unsure about the etiology of her fall and thought that it could possibly have been due to her hypovolemia leading to orthostasis, questionable vasovagal (although not a classic story), seizures, h/o arrhythmia, holter in past reportedly had + tachyarthymia to 180s in the past and the pt is currently followed by cardiologist.
Upon completion of fluid resucitation and the maintenance of a stable of blood pressure, the patient was evaluated by PT and was considered to be safe to go home.
Thus, we thought that her fall was probably secondary to orthostatis caused by volume depletion base on its response to re-hydration.
Prevertebral fluid collection: The patient was evluated by neurosurgery and this fluid collection was not thought to be secondary to fracture or infection.
Acute Renal Failure: Her elevated creatinine responded well to re-hydration and thus her acute renal failure was considered to be secondary to hypovolemia.
Metabolic acidosis: Upon fluid resuscitation with normal saline the patient devloped a mild metabolic acidosis which resolved with IV bicarb supplementation.
Nausea and vomiting 2.
Hypotension 3.
Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you feel light headed, experience severe nausea and vomiting, chest pain, shortness of breath.
