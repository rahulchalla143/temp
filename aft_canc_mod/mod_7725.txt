Admission Date:  [**2134-6-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2134-7-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2089-5-17**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: CC:[**CC Contact Info **]  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: STEREPTACTIC BRAIN BIOPSY RIGHT CRANIOTOMY AND RESECTION OF BRAIN MASS EVD PLACEMENT  History of Present Illness: HPI:This is a 45 year old gentleman that has for the last month been feeling anxious and experiencing atypical headaches with some self reported memory issues.
He saw his PCP for these symptoms and was given ativan without any significant improvement in his symptoms.
Immediately following the scan he was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup as the MRI showed a right sided lesion compressing the right lateral ventricle.
He denies nausea, vomiting, dizziness, difficulty ambulating, changes in vision, hearing, or speech, or changes in bowel or bladder habits.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
A tiny 3mm peripheral density is seen adjacent right oblique fissure and is of unlikely cinical significance.
No pleural or pericardial effusions.
Findings are likely those of a small hepatic cyst.
No suspicious liver lesions are identified.
There is mild periportal edema, but no biliary obstruction.
Multiple tiny low-attenuation lesions are seen in both kidneys.
Whilst these lesions are too small to fully characterize, they likely represent small cysts.
The largest lesion measures 9 mm in the lower pole of the left kidney (3:77).
No pathologically enlarged upper abdominal, retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph nodes.
There is no ascites.
Foci of prostatic calcification are noted.
No pathologically enlarged inguinal or pelvic sidewall lymph node.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No lytic or sclerotic bone lesions are identified.
Note is made of two cannulated screws within the left femoral neck and head.
Subcentimeter low-attenuation lesions in the right lobe of liver and both kidneys are too small to characterize but likely represent small cysts.
No convincing evidence of thoracic or abdominal malignancy.
Large peripherally hyperdense, centrally hypodense mass arising from the right thalamus and extending to the mid brain with associated mass effect and compression of the third ventricle resulting in hydrocephalus.
No evidence of enlarged arterial feeders to the right thalamic mass; however, the veins that are normally present near the cisterns are draped around the posterior margin of the mass.
[**2134-6-30**] CT head Impression: Expected post-biopsy changes as above and redemonstration of a right intracranial mass with consequent obstructive hydrocephalus.
[**2134-7-1**]  Functional MRI IMPRESSION: Relatively stable intra-axial mass lesion centered in the right thalamus and extending ventrally in the right mid brain.
The functional MRI of the brain demonstrates the expected activation areas in the primary motor cortex, with no evidence of areas of activation adjacent to the mass lesion.
The DTI color maps with tractography demonstrate deviation of the corticospinal tracts towards the right.
Mild decrease in the size of the lateral ventricles.
Heterogeneous mass lesion in the region of the right thalamus/ pineal gland with extension into the brainstem and mass effect on the right lateral ventricle.
The heterogeneously, predominantly peripherally enhancing right thalamic mass demonstrates a significant one-week interval growth, notably from 41 mm to 48 mm in an axial plane and from 47 mm to 49 mm in a coronal orientation.
There is significant mass effect on the posterior limb of the right internal capsule as well as on the third ventricle with distortion and considerable midline shift.
As far as evaluable from the given sequences, there is no interval complication such as associated hemorrhage.
IMPRESSION: Significant short term interval growth of the thalamic lesion as described above.
Small extraaxial right parietal and temporal, but moderate bifrontal pneumocephalus, correlate clinically and repeat CT is recommended to monitor for tension pneumocephalus.
Small amount of postoperative hemorrhage in the postsurgical cavity and tract.
Small to moderate amount of right parietal and temporal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Increased mass effect on the right lateral ventricle and effacement of the third ventricle, but unchanged midline shift.
No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
[**2134-7-6**] BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and peroneal veins were obtained.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
[**2134-7-6**] MRI brain with and without contrast IMPRESSION: Evidence of residual tumor at the medial and caudal margin of the resection cavity.
No postsurgery complication such as significant hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage or infarction.
Post-surgical changes in right thalamus are again seen and unchanged.
Stable midline shift to the left with unchanged mass effect on the third ventricle.
No change in enlargement of the lateral and third ventricles following removal of the external ventricular drain.
No change in the degree of leftward shift of normally midline structures and compression of the third ventricle.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted through the emergency department to the ICU after outpatient MRI revealed new brain mass.
He underwent screening CT torso to eval for primary malignancy - this was negative.
He underwent placement of a right frontal EVD in the OR on [**7-1**] for hydrocephalus by radiographic imaging.
CT head demostrated catheter placement within the right lateral ventricle without interim hemorrhage.
He had peri-oral numbness intermittently on [**7-3**] and this was felt to be seizure activity.
POstop CT demonstated normal changes without hemorrhage.
EVD was raised to 20 for attempted wean on [**7-7**] but patient became more lethargic and so the drain was dropped back down to 10.
A repeat CT showed no evidence of hydrocephalus.
A repeat LENIs showed no evidence for DVT.
Patient's pain is well-controlled and the patient is tolerating a good oral diet.
Pt's incision is clean, dry and inctact without evidence of infection.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: RIGHT THALAMIC BRAIN MASS ACUTE DELERIUM / HALLUCINATIONS Seizures Hydrocephalus Dysphagia Headaches   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**6-6**] days(from your date of surgery) for a wound check.
