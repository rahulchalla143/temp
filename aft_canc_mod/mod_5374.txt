Admission Date:  [**2131-12-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-2-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-11-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Cefepime / Aztreonam  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: Hemodynamic instability s/p VATS  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: VATS, thoracotomy, chest tubes, BAL, intubation  History of Present Illness: 56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5622**] chromosome ALL s/p allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI with subsequent severe GVHD (diagnosed via transjugular liver biopsy) originally admitted on [**12-30**] for failure to thrive and fall, now with prolonged loculated hemothorax s/p R VATS converted to open thoracotomy, evacuation and decortication.
Prior to this hospitalization, patient discharged on [**12-16**] for suspected graft versus host disease that was diagnosed with transjugular liver biopsy.
Hospital course on that admission was complicated by a tension pneumothorax following biopsy which required a pigtail catheter on [**2131-12-4**] which did not resolve pneumothorax and a surgical chest tube was placed [**12-4**].
Following this pt developed a hemothorax and a significant drop in hematocrit however pneumothorax did not improve and an adidtional Due chest tube was placed [**12-5**].
Chest tube was eventually d/c'd on [**2131-12-16**] and a CXR prior to discharge was notable only for a tiny residual right apical pneumothorax and stable small right-sided loculated pleural effusion.
During her follow-up visit with her Oncologist pt was noted to have weight loss (lost approx 40lbs over the past 3 months) that was attributed to her GVHD.
On chest x-ray pt was noted to have a pleural effusion on the right, a follow up CT chest was notable for multi loculated right pleural effusion.
Pt received 1u PRBC, 2u plts prior to going to the OR on [**1-1**]; during VATs right lower lobe was notable for patchy parts of necrosis, and there was copious bleeding.
Tissue samples demonstrated Gram negative rods and Gram Positive Cocci.
A BAL was performed which demonstrated gram Positive Cocci, Gram Positive Rods, Gram Negative Rods.
However that afternoon while she was being repositioned she developed atrial fibrillation with vent rates to 180s and hypotension to 80s.
Cardiology consult was obtained and they recommened completion of amio IV loading and possible elective DCCV.
On arrival to MICU pt was afebrile with HR 136 AFRVR, BP 123/85 CMV/AC 450x18, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5.
She was able to communicate that she did not have any shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain.
Her husband stated that patient experienced decreased apetite and generalized weakness prior to hospitalization but did not experience fevers, chills, SOB, chest pain.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGICAL HISTORY: [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome positive ALL, status post allogeneic transplant with evidence of disease recurrence.
She has not had any clear evidence of GVH since tapering off her immunosuppression.
The patient's bone marrow biopsy in the setting revealed areas of extensive confluent necrosis and immature mononuclear cell infiltrates, consistent with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
She does have some mild progression of her peripheral neuropathy in the setting of vincristine that she received with her most recent cycle of hyper-CVAD.
Does not smoke or drink alcohol.
Family History: Her father was recently diagnosed with an unknown blood disorder.
No appreciable MRG.
No appreciable mass Ext: [**1-18**]+ bilateral lower extremity edema.
Tenderness to touch bilateral lower extremities.
Able to wiggle toes slightly in bilateral lower extremities   Pertinent Results: [**12-31**] - CT chest - IMPRESSION: Increase of right-sided pleural effusion and subsequent atelectasis.
Complete resolution of the left-sided pleural effusion.
No evidence of infection.
No evidence of lung nodules or of hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Otherwise, no diagnostic abnormality.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2132-1-3**] no major change.
[**1-6**] Echo - IMPRESSION: No endocarditis or abscess seen.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
No biliary ductal dilatation.
No evidence of cholecystitis.
[**1-10**] - portable chest x-ray - right apical pneumothorax now showing signs of tension pneumothorax with shifting of the mediastinum .
[**2132-2-9**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2-7**], there is a small residual apical pneumothorax.
Chest tube remains in place and post-surgical changes are again seen in the right hemithorax.
Gas in the intracranial venous sinuses and cortical veins, as well as in the right internal jugular vein just above the venous catheter entry site.
While the large intracranial venous sinuses and large deep basal veins are patent, some of the small cortical veins may be occluded.
Extensive multifocal cerebral edema and enhancement, right greater than left, which may be related to venous ischemia.
Focus of gas in the proximal right internal carotid artery, origin uncertain.
No evidence of arterial stenoses in the head and neck.
No evidence of intracranial arterial aneurysms.
Moderate compression deformity of the T3 vertebral body.
Extensive multifocal cortical swelling, right greater than left, with ishemia and possible infarction, likely related to cortical venous air embolism which is demonstrated on the concurrent head CTA.
Small foci of increased susceptibility in the affected cortex may correspond to the air emboli or to microhemorrhages.
No occlusion of the large venous sinuses.
There is mild symmetric hypokinesis of the anterior septum and mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 40 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence for hemodynamic compromise.
If there is a suspicion for a paradoxical embolism, a follow-up study by laboratory son[**Name (NI) 16272**] with agitated saline contrast is suggested.
[**2132-2-10**] CT head: IMPRESSION: Progression of extensive multifocal infarctions with dramatic increase in cerebral edema.
New herniation of the cerebellar tonsils and leftward subfalcine herniation.
[**2132-2-11**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no epileptiform activity.
The background activity was very slow and of low voltage suggestive of a severe encephalopathy.
Brief Hospital Course: 56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5622**] chromosome ALL s/p allogeneic transplant s/p DLI in remission with subsequent severe GVHD who on this admission underwent thoracotomy for empyema.
DEATH SUMMARY: Pt was initially admitted for complicated empyema for which she was treated with 3 chest tubes and antibiotics by the SICU team prior to transfer to the medical floor.
Her empyema was complicated by gram negative rod bacteremia and gram negatives found on BAL.
Both her empyema and bacteremia were treated with meropenem.
Meropenem was kept on long after finishing treatment for empyema & bacteremia because of concern for infection given that she still had 3 chest tubes in place.
Her pain was controlled with IV morphine sulfate with a continuous basal amount through a PCA and PO morphine sulfate for breakthrough pain.
From an infectious point of view, meropenem was ultimately stopped because the patient developed c diff which resolved quickly on oral vancomycin.
Her GVHD was likely repsponsible for her rising LFTs and her steroid dose was adjusted during her hospital stay.
Concern for fungal infection in he setting of her LFTs prompted an MRI of the abdomen which showed no fungal infection.
Her metoprolol dose was adjusted to treat her worsening HTN in the setting of her increased dose of cellcept.
Her diet was slowly advanced since she had severe dysphagia and a hoarse voice after her intubation.
After sitting down for a while she suddenly complained of shortness of breath and the nurse placed her on 2L nasal canula for comfort despite a normal oxygen saturation.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 52383**] was found to have left sided hemiparesis and left sided loss of sensation on very brief physical exam.
A stat CXR was ordered due to concern of worsening PTX given the patient reported tachypnea (this CXR was read as not changed from prior).
A CTA of the head was obtained that ultimately showed gas within the intracranial venous sinuses and cortical veins, the right internal jugular vein just above the venous catheter entry site, and the right internal carotid artery.
The CT perfusion study also showed extensive multifocal cerebral edema and enhancement.
They showed extensive multifocal cortical swelling (right greater than left) with ishemia and possible infarction which was likely related to cortical venous air embolism which is demonstrated on the concurrent head CTA.
Following the presence of increased Cheynne-[**Doctor Last Name **] and apneic episodes concerns for airway protection prompted an intubation.
Several hours following intubation she was noted to have fully dilated and fixed bilateral pupils.
The CT of the head showed extensive multifocal infarctions with dramatic increase in cerebral edema, new herniation of the cerebellar tonsils, and leftward subfalcine herniation.
