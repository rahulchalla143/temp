Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is a 2.5 x 1 cm mass on the atrial side of the mitral valve prosthesis.
This may represent a vegetation or thombus.

There are several areas of hypodensities in the spleen.
PELVIS: There is massive ascites.
There is no evidence of bowel dilatation.
There is no suspicious lytic or blastic lesion in skeletal structures.
Massive ascites and anasarca.
No evidence of abscess or fluid collection in the abdomen.
5.6 cm fluid collection in the spleen with several foci of hypodensity in the spleen, probably representing infarction with necrosis.

No focal liver lesions identified.
EGD [**2137-5-1**]: No esophageal varices.
Dieulafoy lesion in the proximal stomach body (ligation).
There was no portal hypertensive gastropathy, andd no gastric varices.

No fatty change, features of venous outflow obstruction are seen.. 3.
Trichrome stain shows focal increased sinusoidal fibrosis.
Reticulin stain shows no definitive features of nodular regenerative hyperplasia.
Iron stain shows no stainable iron.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 year old male with CAD s/p CABG and mech mitral valve [**2131**], HIV+ CD4 50, DM2, transferred from outside hospital with CHF, Enterococcal endocarditis, and ascites.
Course here complicated by chronic GI bleeding and fevers.
:  1) Endocarditis: TEE done on [**4-26**] revealed a vegetation on his prosthetic mitral valve.
Daily EKGs were followed, and were without evidence of abscess or conduction disease.
He had an episode of melena on [**5-4**] and was transfused 2 additional units with appropriate increase in Hct.
He underwent repeat EGD on [**2137-5-7**] and no active bleeding was seen.
His anemia was felt to be multifactorial, possibly with a chronic slow GI bleed, but also secondary to chronic disease (HIV) and chronic renal failure (see below).
He was transferred to the CCU where he had another EGD, this time with visualization of bleeding from clips at site of Dieulafoy.
3) Chronic renal failure:  Creatinine baseline appears to be around 1.0, however he has been between 1.3 and 2.0 on many occasions over the last few years, likely related to his fluid balance, making his clearance < 60.
In the end, it is felt most likely secondary to liver cirrhosis with sampling error on the liver biopsy making fibrosis look less extensive than it is.
Reported history of HBV and HCV, however here he is HCV negative, and has prior HBV exposure but negative surface antibody and antigen.
He does have a history of heavy EtOH.
His transaminases were never elevated, though alk phos was mildly elevated at 200 (with elevated GGT).
[**Doctor First Name **] was mildly positive, with elevated IgG, however without transaminase elevation auto-immune hepatitis was less likely.
He ultimately underwent liver biopsy which showed only mild portal inflammation.
Hepatology felt that his ascites was unlikely to be secondary to a primary liver process, however again, this seems statistically most likely.
Potential etiologies include liver disease with pseudoexudate from diuresis, versus TB peritonitis, versus carcinomatosis.
Surgery was consulted for consideration of peritoneal biopsy, however they felt that given the possibility that this is pseudoexudate from diuresis, he would best be followed up as an outpatient.
5) Pseudogout:  He complained of acute onset left knee pain shortly before discharge.
He had an effusion that was tapped, revealing calcium pyrophosphate crystals consistent with pseudogout (no evidence of septic arthritis).
His pain actually remitted on its own without treatment.
If this pain recurrs could use colchicine 0.6 mg daily (decreased dose for renal failure).
He was continued on coumadin for anticoagulation, with heparin drip while subtherapeutic (he always needs to be anticoagulated with heparin bridge while INR < 2.5 given structural AF in the setting of mitral regurgitation and high risk of embolus).
7) Mechanical mitral valve:  His INR subtherapeutic for the majority of the hospitalization and his coumadin was held at various times for procedures.
Meformin is contraindicated given his creatinine, and thiazolidenediones are difficult in the setting of CHF (fluid retention).
A sulfonylurea is a possibility, but this can be started at rehab or in the outpatient setting - given his renal insufficiency would use glipizide rather than glyburide.
10) Nutrition:  Ordered for a diabetic/cardiac diet.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 2222**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Enterococcus Endocarditis Coronary artery disease Congestive heart failure Mechanical mitral valve HIV Diabetes Mellitus Ascites Dieulafoy lesion with upper GI bleeding Anemia Chronic kidney disease   Discharge Condition: Ambulating, afebrile, no joint pain.
Discharge Instructions: As you know, you had an infection on your heart valve.
Please call your primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 911 if you experience fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, increased leg swelling, weight gain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or other concerning symptoms.
