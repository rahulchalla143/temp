At that time he had anemia, a low platelet count, and a borderline low white blood count.

IMAGES ====== Head CT [**2165-6-13**] NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, parenchymal edema, or mass effect.
A right frontal approach ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter is again identified, in unchanged position, with tip traversing the septum pellucidum and terminating in the left lateral ventricle.
There is no shift of midline structures, and there is no effacement of the basal cisterns.
There is no CT evidence of territorial infarct.
Cavernous carotid calcifications are noted.
Renal Ultrasound [**2165-6-13**] No hydronephrosis or other findings to explain acute renal failure.
Multifocal pneumonia which may be bacterial or fungal, with vasculitis a less likely consideration.
Normal abdominal ultrasound without gallbladder or biliary pathology.
Echogenic focus in the interpolar region of right kidney likely represents milk of calcium though a nonobstructing renal calculi is a possibility.
High signal on FLAIR images within the cerebral sulci may be secondary to recent lumbar puncture, although infectious leptomeningitis cannot be excluded by imaging.
High signal on FLAIR images within the dura may be related to the recent lumbar puncture or the VPS, but infectious pachymeningitis cannot be excluded by imaging.
No evidence for cerebritis or PRES.
Bilateral small superior parietal subdural collections, right greater than left, similar to [**2165-6-13**] but new since [**2164-12-25**].
Coalescent consolidation of previous multifocal nodular opacities within the lungs.
Innumerable bilateral submillimeter nodules with ground-glass attenuation distributed throughout both lungs with relative sparing of the periphery.
Overall findings are concerning for semi-invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.
No cavitation noted within these coalescent areas of consolidation.
Non-obstructing 4-mm right renal calculus.
No intra-abdominal collection identified.
Echo [**2165-6-23**] Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with global free wall hypokinesis.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 year old M with transfusion dependent MDS, D+7 s/p allo SCT, normal pressure hydrocephalus, CAD, HTN and diabetes, who was initially electively admitted for allo SCT with clofarabine, total nodal radiation and anti-thymoglobulin.
His course was complicated by febrile neutropenia and renal failure.
He developed metabolic acidosis and worsening confusion over the course of several days leading up to his transplant.
On SCT day +3, he was transferred to ICU for worsening mental status, increased respiratory distress, and renal failure.
However, two days later he was at dialysis when he developed an episode of altered mental status associated with tachycardia, hypertension and hypoxia to 88% on 2L NC.
In addition, he became hypotensive requiring pressors for a few hours; pressors were eventually weaned off, although he then developed shock liver and probable DIC requiring multiple transfusions.
On evaluation, he was unresponsive and did not have palpable pulses.
Pulseless electrical activity was noted on the monitor at interval 2-minute pulse checks (no shockable rhythm).
At that time, the patient was examined and was noted to have no audible breath or heart sounds.
