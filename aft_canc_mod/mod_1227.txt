On the day of admit she became acutely short of breath.
In her last hospitalization she underwent an EGD (biopsy with blunted villi and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes), colonoscopy, transvaginal ultrasound, Mammogram, PEG placement, and a bronchoscopy.
Her Na was 124 (recently diagnosed with a paraneoplastic syndrome and has had hyponatremia for the last week).
In the MICU, she was tachycardic and subjectivly short of breath.
No peripheral edema, no rashes, no sick contacts, no myalgias.

Imaging Chest XR ([**2125-6-8**] 3:31 PM) IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities.
While findings could represent prominent bibasilar atelectasis, aspiration or infectious process is of concern.
Bibasilar opacities are consistent with areas of atelectasis.
No appreciable worsening since the prior study has been demonstrated.
Brief Hospital Course: # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Likely [**1-9**] aspiration of secretions from dysphagia/paraneoplastic disorder.
A trial extubation occurred after treatment with antibiotics and scopolamine to try to decrease secretions, but she became acutely dyspenic almost immediately after extubation and required re-intubation.
It was felt that her upper airway collapse, secondary to her paraneoplastic syndromes,  was the cause of her respiratory distress.
She continued to require frequent suctioning while on the floor and ultimately failed a Passy-Muir valve trial due to her secretions.
# Anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] antibody syndrome and [**Location (un) **]-[**Location (un) **] myasthenic syndrome:  Neurology was consulted early in her hospital course, as they have been following her previously.
Neurology continued to follow the patient while in house and she was treated with 5 days of IVIg, prednisone 60mg qd, and Mestinon 60mg PO for symptomatic relief of her muscle weakness and oculobulbar symptoms (disconjugate gaze and dysphagia).
# Hematocrit drop: Her hematocrit started trending down while in the MICU and she was transfused 1 unit of pRBCs with good response.
Iron studies, hemolysis labs, and guaiac testing revealed a likely anemia of chronic disease (high ferritin, low TIBC, normocytic).
Though IVIg can be a cause of hemolysis, laboratory testing did not show evidence of any hemolysis.
There was no evidence of an active bleed or hemodynamic instability.
# Hyponatremia:  Her sodium levels were measured as low as 126, thought to be secondary to her paraneoplastic disorders, described above.
#Thrombocytosis: Platelet elevation likely due to its role as an acute phase reactant, as ferritin and haptoglobin have a similar role and were also elevated.
