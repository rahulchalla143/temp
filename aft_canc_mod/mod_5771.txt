Admission Date:  [**2188-2-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2188-3-7**]   Service:  [**Hospital1 212**]/MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83 year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease status post left anterior descending coronary artery stent, history of recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding with a history of arterial venous malformations, colon cancer status post colectomy and ileocolonic anastomosis who presented with melanic stools and lightheadedness times three days.
At that time the patient continued to complain of lightheadedness, but denies any shortness of breath, chest pain or abdominal pain.
Coronary artery disease status post stent to the left anterior descending coronary artery.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with mitral regurgitation.
History of multiple arterial venous malformations with a 15 year history of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
History of Duke's A colon cancer status post right hemicolectomy in [**2176**].
History of jejunal lipoma in [**2176**].
ALLERGIES:  The patient reports no known drug allergies.
Generally, the patient was a well developed thin male in no acute distress.
Head and neck examination revealed normocephalic, atraumatic.
Sclera anicteric.
Lungs clear to auscultation with good breath sounds and air movement.
No rhonchi, rales or wheezing.
Heart was regular rate and rhythm with a grade 3 out of 6 holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex.
No rubs or gallops.
There were positive normoactive bowel sounds.
No evidence of hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities were warm and well perfuse with no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Gastrointestinal bleeding:  The patient underwent a tagged red blood cell scan on [**2188-2-14**], which demonstrated a very small amount of gastrointestinal bleeding mostly in the left lower quadrant most likely within the small bowel.
Therefore he underwent enteroscopy on [**2188-2-15**], which demonstrated polyps in the stomach, body and fundus as well as blood in the duodenum and proximal jejunum.
No angiomata were seen at that time, otherwise enteroscopy was normal.
He continued to have melena as well as lability in his blood pressure and hematocrit.
Because of dropping hematocrits and recurrent melanotic stools the patient underwent a pill study on [**2188-2-22**], which showed fresh blood and active bleeding from the arterial venous malformations seen in the proximal small bowel.
He continued again to have melanotic stools and had repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2188-2-25**].
This demonstrated erythema nodularity in the antrum compatible with gastritis, as well as angiectasias in the proximal jejunum.
This was accompanied with diaphoresis, shortness of breath and lightheadedness.
It was washed with no active bleeding.
There was significant blood and clot in the jejunum.
The patient therefore was taken to the Interventional Radiology Suite where he underwent angiography and embolization of the gastroduodenal and left gastric artery.
Repeat enteroscopy was performed on [**2188-3-6**], which demonstrated red blood in the second part of the duodenum and an ulcer ni the second part of the duodenum.
Basically the patient was afforded with serial transfusions to keep his hematocrit appropriate above 30 in light of his history of coronary artery disease.
Coronary artery disease/aortic stenosis:  The patient has a history of myocardial infarction with anemia.
Echocardiogram on [**2188-2-21**] showed hyperdynamic with EF 75% with severe resting outflow tract obstruction left ventricular hypertrophy as well as 3+ mitral regurgitation consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
We were unable to titrate the beta-blocker up in light of his low blood pressure.
Tachycardia:  The patient demonstrated several instances of tachycardia mostly in the setting of volume depletion during episodes of bleeding.
Tachycardia improved after volume resuscitation.
No chest pain or shortness of breath.
Recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding with a history of multiple AVMs status post thermal therapy of jejunal angiectasia.
Status post angio embolization of the left gastric and gastric duodenal arteries.
Coronary artery disease status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left anterior descending coronary artery in [**10/2180**], status post myocardial infarction times two in the setting of anemia, baseline electrocardiogram of right bundle branch block.
Anemia secondary to blood loss.
Diastolic dysfunction.
Aortic stenosis.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
History of colon cancer status post right hemicolectomy.
He was instructed that if he noticed bright red blood in his stool, increasing darkening stools, shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue or lightheadedness that he return to the Emergency Room immediately.
He was instructed that we added Metoprolol to his medication regimen as this had long term beneficial effects for people with heart disease.
