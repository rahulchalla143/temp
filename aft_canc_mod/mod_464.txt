At baseline, the pt experiences chest pain which is relieved by a nitro patch and is able to walk short distances slowly in her daughter's apt without feeling SOB.
She appeared hypovolemic and was given 2L NS.
CXR w/ CHF and ?
She was also found to have anemia and received 1u PRBC.
She complained of chest pain, probably due to demand ischemia, with transient 1mm STD's noted on lateral leads of EKG, which resolved on f/u EKG, as did her CP within an hour.

The left atrium is moderately dilated.
4.The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No MR seen.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
Renal ultrasound: CONCLUSION: Multiple bilateral renal cysts.
No hydronephrosis or calculi.
Although IV contrast usage would likely be difficult in this patient with renal failure, but a CT scan or MRI suggested for delineating anatomy in the upper abdomen.
EKG: sinus tachycardia, IVCD with poor R wave progession, [**Street Address(2) 11342**] depressions in I, avL, V6 that subsequently resolved 1 hr later.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course: Her blood pressure stabilized and her mental status improved, allowing transfer to the floor in stable condition [**8-17**] 9 PM.
Echo [**8-17**] showed normal LVEF >55% with normal LV size and no significant valvular disease (some aortic valve leaflet thickening).
1) SOB: On further eval of CXR, pt believed to have increased opacity in LLL.
Blood cultures were no growth.
Pt had lateral ST changes in ED but cardiac enzymes remained negative, so believed from strain.
No other events.
Given albuterol/atrovent nebs and cough suppression with some relief.
3) Hypotension: Believed secondary to dehydration and infection.
4) CLL: WBC elevated here to 30s.
With h/o CAD goal Hct closer to 30.
Pt denied any symptomatic improvement.
5) Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient's baseline Cr 1.2-1.4; on admission was 1.9.
Renal ultrasound showed bilateral renal cysts, no evidence of obstruction or hydro.
Spoke with patient's VNA who reported patient has had cough with lisinopril previously, so will not restart.
Believed lesion in L lower abdomen was seborrheic keratosis.
8) FEN: Patient's potassium was well maintained without supplement.
