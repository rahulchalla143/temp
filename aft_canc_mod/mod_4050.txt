Pt was recovering well in the PACU w/ minimal bleeding noted (of not pt was currently menstruating).
She then ambulated to the bathroom to void & at that time was noted by the patient and the RN to have bright red oozing from the left vulvar incision.
Initially pressure was held on the wound without hemostasis being achieved.
Furthermore, after the additional sutures were placed, she began to develop a vulvar hematoma which also needed to be evacuated.
Thus, the pt was immediately taken back to the OR for exploration of the vulvar incisions and control of the bleeding vessels & evacuation of vulvar hematoma.
