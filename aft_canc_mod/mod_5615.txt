CT head w/o contrast [**2132-3-22**]: IMPRESSION: No acute change from prior study.
Right cerebral hypodensity is consistent with known GBM.
Dystrophic calcification in the right temporal lobe and right basal ganglia reflects either post-treatment change or prior hemorrhage.
There is no acute hemorrhage identified.
Encephalomalacia from prior right parietal and right occipital infarcts is noted.
No hydrocephalus.
Abdominal pneumoperitoneum, which may be due to jejunal ischemia and infarct given abnormal-appearing jejunal loops with wall thickening, possible pneumatosis and mesenteric fat stranding and fluid.
Bibasilar consolidations which may be atelectasis, although pneumonia is not excluded.
Small effusions.
Small pericardial effusion.
Echo [**2132-3-24**]: The right atrium is moderately dilated.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There is evidence of diastolic dysfunction.
KUB [**2132-3-26**]: IMPRESSION: Small amount of free air visualized in the left lateral decubitus abdominal radiograph and consistent with persistant pneumoperitoneum.

?s and GBM with recent intracranial hemorrhage [**12-25**], who presented with altered mental status with concern for pneumonia, intubated in ER due to altered mental status and airway protection.
He was admitted to ICU where an abdominal CT was obtained for abdominal distention and pneumoperitoneum was found.
Hypotension due to sepsis was treated with pressors and IVF.
# Pneumoperitoneum with sepsis: Managed medically due to poor surgical candidacy.
The repeated normal lactate spoke against bowel ischemia as the underlying process.
Bowel perforation may have been promoted by chronic steroid therapy.
# Altered mental status: Continued delirium.
Once changed to PO, he no longer required IV access or restraints.
After initial hypotension, he developed HTN with SBP's to the 180's.
# UTI: Proteus and Klebsiella UTI treated with ceftriaxone.
# DMII: Volatile blood sugars.
# Acute Renal Failure: Resolved.
In the setting of almost normal BNP, this was likely [**3-19**] to hypovolemia/distributive shock rather than CHF exacerbation with poor forward flow.
# GBM/Intracranial hemorrhage: Continued outpatient levetiracetam.
# Asymmetrical leg edema: Considering inability to anticoagulate given recent ICH and family's wish for no filter, further work-up was not be pursued.
# Cough: Controlled with PRN benzonatate and ipratropium nebs.
# Tinea pedis: Continued miconazole cream [**Hospital1 **].
# EKG changes/Troponin elevation: Due to demand ischemia.
Chest pain free.
Hypophosphatemia repleted.
# PPx: Pneumoboots.
No heparin due to ICH history.
# Lines: Port.
# Precautions: Fall.
# Code: DNR, but okay to intubate.

Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for altered mental status (delirium, confusion) and required intubation (breathing machine) in order to protect your airway and keep breathing.
You were not well enough for surgery, so this was treated with antibiotics.
In addition, for very low blood pressure, you needed IV fluids and pressors (medications that increase blood pressure.
Once your blood pressure returned, you needed blood pressure medication for hypertension.
Acute kidney failure resolved with IV fluids.
You were also treated for a Proteus and Klebsiella urinary tract infection.
Trazadone 25mg q2PM and 12.5mg TID PRN agitation was not given during this hospitalization, but can be restarted.
