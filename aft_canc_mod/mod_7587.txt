Lung volumes are low, there is continued left lower lobe opacity with partial silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm, corresponding to atelectasis on prior CT. Small left pleural effusion is also present.
Old healed right anterior second through fourth rib deformities.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged left lower lobe atelectasis and small effusion.
CTA ABD & PELVIS: FINDINGS: There has been slight increase in moderate left and small right simple pleural effusions, with associated compressive atelectasis.
ABDOMEN: There has been interval decrease in moderate ascites post-paracentesis.
Moderate ascites is present throughout the abdomen.
There is diffuse omental caking, with lobulated enhancing masses encasing the entire upper peritoneum, particularly .
Soft tissue implants are also noted along the right hepatic lobe extending into [**Location (un) 6813**] pouch and along the right kidney and paracolic gutter, right anterior omentum, periportal space tracking along the falciform ligament, gastrohepatic ligament, and splenic hilum tracking inferiorly along the left paracolic gutter.
There is centralization of bowel loops and viscera, compatible with malignant ascites.
The liver enhances homogeneously, without focal lesions.
Gallbladder is partially collapsed, with mild wall edema secondary to third spacing.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation.
The kidneys are atrophic, with cortical thinning and lobulation suggesting prior ischemic or infectious injury, as well as multiple dystrophic calcifications.
Moderate hydronephrosis and proximal hydroureter persists, tapering gradually into the pelvis without evidence of obstructing stones.
Mild wall edema is noted in the first and second portions of the duodenum, likely due to third spacing.
PELVIS: Again seen is a large pelvic mass measuring 14.7 cm AP x 12.7 cm TV x 12.5 cm SI.
This is a markedly heterogeneous appearance with irregular enhancement due to mixed solid and cystic components, internal septations, and coarse internal calcification.
A 1-cm pedunculated lesion along the medial wall of the ascending colon (600B:33) may represent an epiploic appendage.
Mild wall edema is noted in the hepatic flexure, likely due to third spacing.
The proximal sigmoid colon is encased within the pelvic mass and collapsed.
However, there is partial reconstitution of the mid-sigmoid, as well as a patulous rectum with intact oral contrast passage, excluding physiologic obstruction.
The uterus is contained within the right inferior aspect of the mass, and appears distorted, with retained fluid in the endometrial canal.
There is mild lumbar dextroscoliosis, with multilevel degenerative changes.
Unchanged L2 compression fracture demonstrates 50% loss of anterior height.
Bilateral pars defects are noted at L4-L5, with grade [**2-11**] anterolisthesis and near complete loss of disc space.
There is minimal retrolisthesis at L5-S1.
Marked deformity of the sacrum, which is deviated to the left, with apparent post-traumatic deformity at S1-S2.
Old healed fractures of the bilateral inferior pubic rami.
There has been interval development of a 7.1 cm TV x 5 cm AP x 9.2 cm SI intramuscular hematoma in the left paraspinal muscle, spanning the L1 through L4 levels.
There is no evidence of retroperitoneal extension.
Diffuse anasarca is present.
CT ARTERIOGRAM: There is no evidence of active arterial extravasation.
CT VENOGRAM: There is no evidence of venous extravasation.
The portal, splenic, superior and inferior mesenteric, and hepatic veins are widely patent.
Again noted is near-occlusive thrombus involving the distal right common and proximal right external iliac veins.
Left common femoral and superficial femoral venous clots have at least partially resolved.
New left paraspinal hematoma, without active extravasation.
Decrease in malignant ascites post-paracentesis.
Diffuse metastatic omental caking and peritoneal seeding.
Large pelvic mass, with distal ureteral obstruction and encasement of the sigmoid colon and uterus.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 58 year old F with Multiple Sclerosis with recent discharge for UTI, altered mental status, bilateral DVT's on lovenox, and new diagnosis of ovarian cancer, who presents with tachycardia, 5 point hematocrit drop, guaiac positive stools, and recent paracentesis complicated with bleeding.
On lovenox for DVTs, so has increased risk of bleeding.
Likely primarily due to new left paraspinal muscle hematoma seen on CT (7.1 cm TV x 5 cm AP x 9.2 cm SI, spanning the L1 through L4 levels).
GI was consulted - felt that the acute blood loss was more likely related to paraspinal hematoma rather than GI bleed.
# Tachycardia: She was also tachycardic during last [**Date Range **], attributed at that time to hypermetabolic state and metoprolol was uptitrated from XL 75mg daily to 37.5mg TID.
[**Month (only) 116**] also be due worsened by acute blood loss (see above) and DVT.
Metoprolol was held briefly for concern of further GI bleeding, however HR increased to 120s without further evidence of bleeding so metoprolol was restarted at 25mg TID just prior to trasnfer to medicine floor.
We held her lovenox on [**Month (only) **], given concern for acute bleed.
V/Q scan from recent [**Month (only) **] here showed low probability for PE.
# UTI: Multiple previous UTI's due to chronic indwelling foley.
# Ovarian Cancer, probable: Large pelvic mass visualized again.
According to her brother, her mental status has waxed and waned considerably in the last few weeks.
#END OF LIFE CARE: Over the last few days of her hospitalization, Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] had persistent encephalopathy, and became less interactive.
There was no clear reversible cause of her encephalopathy.
Neurology was consulted - they thought that her encephalopathy was most likely toxic-metabolic, though paraneoplastic encephalopathy or non-convulsive seizures could also be playing a role.
Bedside EEG was done -showed generalized encephalopathy, but no seizure activity.
Given the extent of her cancer and her poor functional status, she was not a candidate for surgery nor for chemotherapy.
In a meeting on [**2-28**], given Ms. [**Known lastname **] declining status, new signs of discomfort (groaning, poor responsiveness), no identifiable reversible cause of encephalopathy, and overall disease burden, it was decided (with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known lastname 1007**] and multidisciplinary team) to shift to comfort-focused care.
