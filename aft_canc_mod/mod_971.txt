He had last chemo dose on Monday and had a week of his usual post-chemo fatigue.
He had significant epistaxis the night prior to vomiting that required packing.

Had complained of some abdominal pain.
He did endorse lightheadedness and dizziness.
Throughtout ED course, compained of abdominal pain, and wife noted he had some ectopy on his tele.

OG tube placed, no red blood on lavage, no coffee-grounds were noted.
Norepinephrine started for BP support.
Of note, patient had been using MagicMouth for esophageal discomfort.
Past Medical History: COPD/ pulmonary fibrosis HTN DM2 neuropathy, nephropathy Barrett's esophagus and GERD, recently (in [**October 2133**]) diagnosed with esophageal CA s/p XRT being treated now with 5-FU and CPT-11; AVR in [**2133**].
[**Male First Name (un) 1525**] mechanical valve CAD s/p 2v-CABG [**19**] PPM placed for AF (previously treated on amiodarone- discontinued because of concerns pulmonary fibrosis from amiodarone) S/P AVJ ablation for atrial fibrillation; VVI electronic Sigma Pacemaker; congestive heart failure [**2-18**] diastolic dysfunction (EF 35%); Strongyloides resulting in eosinophilia and dyspnea, hypothyroid, left renal artery stenosis, htn, hypercholesterol, CRI (baseline Cr 2.8-3.4)   Social History: Married.

Again noted is left-sided pleural thickening and adjacent parenchymal scarring.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
There is a small left pleural effusion.
There is no evidence of free air underneath the hemidiaphragms.
There is no evidence of acute obstruction.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 yo male with esophageal cancer, one week after his last chemo, who presented with coffee-grounds emesis after having significant epistaxis requiring packing.
While in the ED, patient had a VT/VF arrest that resolved after one shock, and remained hypotensive thereafter.
VT/VF arrest: The pt was found in the ED to be unresponsive with a rapid heart rhythm that was assessed by the ED physicians to be V-tach vs VF.
There were no ECG rhythm strips recorded for review.
Patient is at risk for VT/VF with his hx of CHF as well as prior CAD.
He was started on a lidocaine drip at 30ug/kg per min for suppression of VT, which was continued on arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
The pt was evaluated by cardiology in the ED who agreed that he had a possible episode of VF and that lido vs amio could be continued initially.
Given that there were no recurrent events, lidocaine was discontinued on the following day.
It was likely that sepsis was the precipitating event.
The patient tolerated amiodarone loading, and he had no further events on telemetry.
GI bleed/hematemesis: Likely this was from large epistaxis the night prior to presentation and did not represent GI bleed.
However, he is at risk for bleed given esophageal cancer/xrt.
Hct trended down from ~30 to 23.3 during his hospital course, and he was guaiac positive, though he had no gross blood loss since ICU admission.
INR was 5.3, and he was reversed with 3 U FFP and transfused 2U pRBC in setting of CAD and recent VT event.
CAD s/p CABG:  He had no current evidence of active ischemia, and ruled out by enzymes.
Aspirin not given due to low platelet counts, and statin started.
Aortic valve replacement: Pt has St. Jude's valve with high risk for clot and requiring anti-coagulation.
