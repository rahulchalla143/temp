No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
There is no other diagnostic interim change.
Chest Xray [**2198-10-2**]: New interval haziness/blunting at the left costophrenic angle, which could be due to left small pleural effusion and adjacent small atelectasis at the left lung base; however, cannot rule out pneumonia.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the mid inferolateral and anterolateral walls, and distal anterior, inferior and apical segments.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction suggestive of multivessel CAD.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Chest Xray [**2198-10-4**]: There is interval development of bilateral perihilar, right more than left, interstitial linear opacities continuing toward the lung bases, including the bilateral subpleural linear opacities as seen in particular in the right lower lobe, findings that are consistent with interval development of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
There is no interval development of mediastinal widening.
There is no appreciable increase in pleural effusion, although small amount of right pleural fluid is most likely present.
Normal-sized kidneys without signs of hydronephrosis.
Small nonobstructive right renal stone is noted.
Mucosal-based soft tissue nodule in the right posterolateral bladder wall suggestive of urothelial neoplasm.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferolateral wall and severe hypokinesis of the mid to distal anterior wall and septum.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2198-10-3**], overall ejection fraction has decreased with worsened function of the anterior wall, anterior septum and anterolateral wall.
Angina: He presented with acceleration of his typical angina symptoms and had unstable angina on admission.
His cardiac enzymes fluctuated during this admission, and he continued to have anginal symptoms intermittently throughout the hospitalization.
They decided to proceed with cardiac catheterization for stenting of his proximal LAD lesion.
He had a slight right groin hematoma after catheterization that remained stable.
He was chest pain free after the procedure.
Pump: On admission, he had a history of 1 month of peripheral edema and he appeared volume overloaded by chest xray at [**Location (un) 620**].
He had a TTE after admission which showed preserved systolic function.
He had one episode of hypoxia, shortness of breath, and increasing volume overload on physical exam that was responsive to IV Lasix.
He intermittently required low doses of Lasix for pulmonary edema diagnosed by physical exam and chest xray.
There was some concern for anemia-induced angina, and his hematocrit was maintained greater than 33.
He was transfused a total of 4 units of blood during and prior to his cardiac catheterization and continued his outpatient Procrit injections.
His anemia was decreased on the day of discharge and he received an additional unit of prbcs with resulting post-transfusion Hct of 31.9.
He should likely have a hematocrit drawn in two days to assess for any continued drop.
He had no change in his groin hematoma and no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed at the time of discharge.
Acute Renal Failure: His creatinine increased from 1.2 on admission to 2.9 at its peak.
The nephrology service was consulted and his urine lytes were consistent with prerenal etiology.
It was felt that his acute renal failure was due to poor forward flow in addition to light diuresis.
Renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis.
He was given mucomyst and IV fluids prior to catheterization to prevent contrast nephropathy.
The SQ heparin was stopped, and his PTT remained elevated for approximately 5 days after stopping it.
The etiology of his elevated PTT was not entirely clear, but it was not worked up further for a specific factor deficiency.
Hematuria: He had hematuria on admission and was found to have a mass in his bladder on renal ultrasound that was thought to be the cause of his hematuria.
Dysphagia: The patient experienced some dysphagia with his pills and liquids during his hospitalization.
This was thought to be due to deconditioning and was not worked up further and he was given Ensure Plus for nutritional supplementation.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) **] - [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Coronary Artery Disease Acute on chronic kidney disease  Secondary Diagnosis: Anemia Myelodysplasia Hematuria   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital due to chest pain.
You also had acute renal failure while you were in the hospital that was thought to be due to poor forward blood flow from your heart.
You had a hematoma (bruise) in your right groin after the procedure which did not get bigger.
You also worked with physical therapy after this procedure.\  You were found to have a bladder mass on imaging during this hospitalization that is likely the cause of your hematuria (blood in your urine).
-Stopped your lisinopril due to your low blood pressures and renal failure.
