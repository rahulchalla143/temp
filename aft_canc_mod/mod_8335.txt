Admission Date:  [**2186-6-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2186-6-27**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Penicillins / Aspirin / Fentanyl  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6578**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Pt is a 82 year old female with a long history of lung cancer and bilateral lobectomies and current metastases to brain, as well as [**Hospital 11491**] transfered from the MICU after being admitted with a pneumonia.
Past Medical History: # Lung cancer - s/p RUL lobectomy in [**2169**] for bronchoalveolar carcinoma - s/p segemental resection of posterior segment of LUL in [**2173**] - path = adenoca NOS, moderately differentiated features, neg LN  - repeat mass found in LUL in [**2183**] -> bronchoscopy -> developed resp failure post bronch requiring ventilation (?
[**1-20**] muscle rigidity from fentanyl) - path of [**2184-1-22**] mass = infiltrating adenoca w/ papillary features - then found L hilar mass -> 6 cycles chemo w/ navelbine + XRT - L hilar mass enlarged, plus new mass at R lung base (20 x 13mm) - opted for no further treatment # COPD - last PFTs in [**2173**] - FEV1 1.80, FVC 2.05, FEV1/FVC 88 (125%) # hypothyroidism # h/o TIA/CVA - MRA in [**2172**] showed 80%+ stenosis of [**Doctor First Name 3098**], 90%+ of [**Country **] - s/p L CEA in [**2172**] (h/o R CEA in past) - [**2182**]: R ICA w/ 70-79% stenosis L ICA w/ 60-69% stenosis - MRA in [**2182**] showed subacute vs. acute infarct L internal capsule - per neuro notes, strokes have been bilateral and had residual L sided hemiparesis (though not noted on neuro exams) # Parkinson's # PVD and claudication # Cervical stenosis - s/p anterior cervical disk excision and fusion of screws # HTN # Osteoarthritis and osteoporosis # s/p R THR in [**2171**] for OA - then had R hip dislocation in [**2181**], s/p closed reduction # OSA - not on CPAP # h/o PUD # Depression # CRI - baseline Cr is 1.7 - 3.2 in last 2 yrs   Social History: Lives at [**Location 5583**] House x 2 yrs.
90 pack-yr smoker.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: AM on the floor: Vitals: RR 8 General: sick female in respiratory distress Skin: pink, no rashes HEENT: NCAT, MMM dry CV: HRRR, nl S1 and S2, no m/r/g Pulm: Bilateral rhonchi and rales.
Patient with agonal gasps.
Head CT [**6-23**]: IMPRESSION: At least two hyperdense lesions at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] white matter junction with associated vasogenic edema worrisome for new metatatic intracranial disease.
Additional areas of vasogenic edema detected raising suspicion for additional lesions.
No resultant mass-effect or midline shift.
Head CT [**6-24**]: IMPRESSION:  Multiple supra- and infratentorial enhancing nodules, the majority of which demonstrate fast diffusion, which argues against abscess and in favor of metastatic disease.
Persistent opacity at the left lower lobe and perihilar region likely related to known left hilar mass.
Post obstructive changes in the left base likely represent atelectasis and/or pneumonia.
Increased opacity over the left upper lobe which might be due to worsening atelectasis due to known left perihilar mass.
Unchanged right lower retrocardiac consolidation which may be due to aspiration or infection.
Diagnostic  considerations include pulmonary edema.
Pneumonia is not excluded.
Small right-sided effusion.
CXR [**6-25**]: IMPRESSION: Marked improvement in aeration of the left upper lung with persistent left mid and upper lung airspace opacity.
Unchanged right mid and lower lung airspace opacity and right-sided pleural effusion.
Diagnostic considerations again include asymmetric pulmonary edema and pneumonia.
Left atrial abnormality.
Q waves in leads V1-V2 suggest the possibility of anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
There are also T wave inversions in leads V1-V3.
She began agonal breathing on [**7-19**] and her RR decreased over until she became apneic on [**6-27**].
Discharge Medications: None  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Respiratory failure due to pneumonia, lung cancer with metastases, and COPD.
