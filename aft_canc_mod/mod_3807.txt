EGD [**2150-5-26**] w/ gastritis/erosions; treated with PPI PO BID and repeat EGD [**2150-5-28**] showed interval improvement.
Colonoscopy [**2150-5-28**] showed internal hemorrhoids and multiple sessile nonbleeding polyps 3-8 mm polyps in cecum, transverse, sigmoid, and rectum with granularity in cecum c/w polypoid tissue (biopsy showed focal hyperplastic changes, lymphoid aggregade and focal active inflamation with a few crypt abscesses).
Given recent right fem-posterior tibial bypass and right TMA c/b wound infection, he was covered with vanco/levo/flagyl and vascular surgery was consulted, who recommended right arterial duplex U/S.
This was performed on [**2150-5-27**], c/w high grade right femoral-tibial bypass graft stenosis just above tibiofemoral joint space, and he was transferred to the vascular surgery service [**5-31**].
His anticoagulation was changed from lepirudin to argatroban and he underwent a RLE arteriogram [**6-1**] which showed 80-99% stenosis at mid fem-posterior tibial argery graft; angioplasty performed X 2.
On [**6-4**] p.m., his RR increased to 24 and his mental status declined, necessitating transfer to SICU and intubation.
Given drop in HCT (26.3 from 33.1), drop in plt (33 from 106 on admit), argotroban was discontinued and hematology was consulted, who felt this was most likely secondary to septic physiology (no evidence of TTP or hemolysis).
His respiratory decompensation was felt to be most likely secondary to CHF exacerbation and lasix/nesiritide gtt were started.
Given large bilateral pleural effusions, right larger than left, a thoracentesis was performed [**2149-6-17**], the GS of which showed 1+ PMN without organisms, fluid analysis consistent with transudative process.
Brief summary of MICU course: 1) Respiratory failure: Initial intubation most likely secondary to septic/SIRS physiology (potential sources C. diff vs TMA infection).
Second intubation and prolonged wean most likely secondary to CHF in setting of ARF.
On transfer to the MICU, he was oxygenating well with a mild respiratory acidosis on minimal ventilatory support (PS 8/5).
Diuresis was continued and he was extubated [**2150-6-24**] without difficulty.
CHF exacerbation likely secondary to fluid resusciation in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure.
3) Acute on chronic renal failure: Initial bump in creatinine to 2.4 [**6-5**] have represented contrast dye nephropathy in the setting of recent arteriogram versus ATN in the setting of hypotension due to SIRS/sepsis.
4) Hypernatremia: At the time of transfer to the MICU, the patient's sodium was 150, likely secondary to aggressive diuresis.
5) Metabolic alkalosis: The patient had a significant metabolic alkalosis on transfer to the MICU, likely secondary to contraction alkalosis in the setting of aggressive diuresis.
6) Resolved sepsis: The patient's initial intubation [**6-4**] was attributed to septic physiology.
Given that he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable, without clinical evidence suggestive of infection, he was maintained off further antibiotics.
He had been started on stress-dose steroids during his SICU stay for treatment of relative adrenal insufficiency (diagnosis based on inadequate response to Cosyntropin stimulation).
7) Atrial fibrillation/flutter: As mentioned above, the Electrophysiology service had been consulted while the patient was in the SICU for pacemaker generator change and for assistance with mangement of atrial fibrillation/flutter.
They recommended discontinuation of amiodarone (given limited utility of continuing it as patient was in atrial flutter) and initiation of anticoagulation given high risk of thromboembolism.
While anticoagulated, his hematocrit will need to be closely monitored given history of GI bleed, and current gauiac positive brown stool.
8) Thrombocytopenia: The worsening of the patient's chronic thrombocytopenia (nadir in the 30s) likely represented a combination of HIT (patient received small dose of heparin as part of heplock of right femoral line on [**6-5**], none subsequently) and septic phsyiology.
His drop in hematocrit (nadir 24) was likely due to acute GI bleed/ acute illness superimposed on chronic process (iron deficiency versus ACD).
10) GI bleed: GI bleed that prompted admission was most likely secondary to gastritis/gastric erosions noted on EGD.
At time of transfer to the MICU, he continued to have brown gauiac positive stool, although his hematocrit was stable.
He will need to closely be monitored for recurrence of GI bleed in the setting of restarting anticoagulation.
11) Coronary artery disease: Following transfer to the MICU, beta-blocker was restarted, with a plan to titrate the dose up as tolerated.
12) Hypothyroidism: TSH elevated at 7.6, although Free T4 was low-normal at 1.0.
These values are difficult to interpret in the setting of acute illness.
13) Type II DM: Following transfer to the MICU, the patient was continued lantus 8 units [**Hospital1 **] (increased from home dose 8 units qAM and 6 units qPM) with HISS.
He became quite depressed and withdrawn.
Over the next few days, patient started to develop pulmonary edema in addition to his anasarca.
