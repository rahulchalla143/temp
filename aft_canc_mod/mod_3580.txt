man with a history of metastatic prostate cancer admitted with back pain and found to have compression fractures with canal narrowing, transferred from neurosurgy without intervention for radiation.
The patient states that he suffered from severe back pain over the past several weeks.
His pain is markedly improved now on fentanyl patch and percocet PRN.
He denies any clear lower extremity weakness or changes in sensation in the lower extremities or groin.
The patient denies any incontinence of bowel or bladder.
The patient was admitted through the ED and found to have mets to T9-10 and L3 with associated canal narrowing and low-level compression.
His course was complicated by urinary retention.
Past Medical History: ONC HX: Pt was initially diagnosed with localized prostate cancer in [**2099**] via a medial laparotomy.
[**10-20**] his PSA started rising, suggesting progression of disease on hydrocortisone and ketoconazole.
His PSA has continued to rise this year going up to 98 [**2111-3-17**] and bone scan at the time showed slightly increased uptake at T10, but no evidence of mets.
CT thorax showed stable lung nodules, adrenal adenoma, fat stranding of left psoas muscles possibly c/w metastatic disease and mildly enlarging infrarenal AAA.
He was then admitted in [**4-/2111**] for back pain and was found to have an L3 lesion concerning for metastases and he was started on XRT.
Between [**7-22**] and the present he has been continued off of all therapies except for Lupron and had been doing well including weaning himself off of all pain medications.
PMH: # CAD s/p MI x2 in [**2081**], [**2098**] # CHF: EF 30% per Oncology notes from sometime in [**2109**], but no study in the OMR # h/o CVA in [**2098**] # Hypertension # Hypercholesterolemia # s/p right CEA # s/p left knee arthroscopic surgery # A. Fib   Social History: Lives in [**Location 3146**] with his wife, retired engineer.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
Unable to assess JVP due to thick neck.
Multilevel metastatic disease as described above with epidural soft tissue component significantly narrowing the ventral canal compressing the cord at T9.
Additionally at L3, there is retropulsion with ventral canal narrowing and impression on the thecal sac.
Paraspinal mass as noted above.
Degenerative changes of the cervical spine as noted above.
Two nonspecific, noncalcified peripheral nodules in the right lung have been stable for 18 months.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
No lymphadenopathy in the abdomen or pelvis.
3.3-cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Osseous metastases at T7 through T11 vertebra with epidural masses at T8 and T9 compressing the thecal sac.
Pathologic compression fracture of L3 with retropulsed fragments.
man with a history of metastatic prostate cancer admitted with back pain and found to have compression fractures with canal narrowing, transferred from neurosurgy without intervention for radiation.
# Spinal mets with question of early compression.
Stable without signs of progressive neurologic symptoms.
Metastatic s/p chemotherapy and radiation.
Last staged in [**9-/2111**] did not show clear progression by imaging but recent increase PSA concerning for progression.
Now newly metastatic to thoracic spine.
Stable without signs of acute disease.
Did he have a hemorrhagic CVA in the past?
EF reportedly 30% sometime in [**2109**] per Oncology notes but no study in OMR.
By the patient's report, anticoagulation was held due to prostatic mets.
We must clarify if the patient had a hemorrhagic or ischemic CVA in the past.
# Urinary retention.
No other signs of associated cord compression to imply a neurologic process.
# Hypertension.
# Hypercholesterolemia.
# Prophylaxis.
Post-operatively he was transferred to the ICU for monitoring due to his previous cardiac history.
He did have an elevated troponin of 0.29 on [**2112-1-18**] which cardiology did not believe was the result of ACS.
45% and the P-MIBI resulted in no anginal symptoms with a maximum heart rate of 59.
The patient had 2 episodes of chest pain btwn [**Date range (1) 53013**] and a few runs of VTach which he broke on his own.
The chest pain appeared to be related to his anxiety but Cardiology was re-consulted prior to discharge and recommended incr.
They cleared the patient for d/c and stated that he should resume full anticoagulation upon d/c as prophylaxis due to his afib.
Prior to discharge he had standing AP/Lat x-rays of spine which showed no evidence of hardware-related complication.
