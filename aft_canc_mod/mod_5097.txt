Ultrasound-guided targeted biopsy of segment VIII liver lesion 3.
male with ESLD on liver transplant list who presented to liver clinic with worsening abdominal distension and encephalopathy and was referred for admission.
One week ago he developed increasing abdominal pain, back pain, and diarrhea.
Since his discharge he has had increasing abdominal distention and pain leading to a therapeutic 2.5 L paracentesis yesterday at his PCP's office which was consistent with SBP.
At home he has had increasing confusion, intermittent fevers/chills, increased itching, poor PO intake, and decreased urine output.

Hepatic cirrhosis.
The hepatic parenchyma is difficult to assess with ultrasound due to the heterogeneity and the abnormality identified on recent MRI is not visualized.
Moderate ascites.
[**5-22**] CT chest - No good evidence for intrathoracic malignancy.
Probable bronchiolitis and minimal reactive lymph node enlargement.
Significant interval enlargement of the previously identified hepatic mass, which demonstrates minimal enhancement.
Given the presence of a new nodule within the right hepatic lobe and the patient's underlying cirrhosis, these findings raise concern for hepatocellular carcinoma, though the enhancement pattern is unusual.
Findings compatible with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
New intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Large heterogeneously hypodense mass in the right lobe of the liver as described above, associated with bilateral intrahepatic ductal dilatation, several smaller areas of hypodensity especially in the right lobe measuring 1.8 cm.
Liver with increased ascites and splenomegaly.
The constellation of the finding is most worrisome for hepatocellular carcinoma with multiple foci in the liver.
4-mm noncalcified nodule at the right lung base, which needs to be followed in three months in this patient with liver tumor.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium  or left atrial appendage.
Left ventricular wall thickness and cavity size are normal.Left ventricular function is hyperdynamic EF 60-70% .No regional wall motion abnormality is obseved Right atrium is mildly dilated.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion is normal.
Pulmonary artery catheter is seen  in the right ventricle and right ventricular outflow tract.There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Interatrial septum is lipomatous a small PFO cannot be ruled out .The mitral valveleaflets are normal, no mitral regurgitation is seen at a SBP of100mm Hg.
Due to poor echo windows unable to comment on tricuspid and aortic regurgitation  LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGL; DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL 1) No fluid collections around the liver.
2) No evidence of biliary dilatation.
However, there is no diastolic blood flow and perhaps some reversibility of the diastolic blood flow.
Brief Hospital Course: # ESLD - Patient was admitted for worsening liver failure and workup for liver transplant.
He was started on SBP prophylaxis with daily ciprofloxacin given no evidence of recurrent SBP by paracentesis and no growth from cultures.
No evidence for portal vein thrombosis on U/S.
Repeat imaging showed dramatic enlargement of his liver mass, preliminary results of liver biopsy were consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma.
Despite liver mass size of 8.8x8.1 cm, it was felt that the rapid growth in size may have been due to hemorrhage or overestimation on size of mass due to surrounding vessels.
The decision was made to keep the patient on the transplant list and would receive a transplant if he had no evidence of metastatic lesions during exploration in the OR.
Induction immunosuppression was started intra-op with a tapering steroid protocol.
# ARF/hyponatremia- His acute renal failure responded well to gentle hydration and he required midodrine/octreotide/albumin for a short period of time early in his admission.
