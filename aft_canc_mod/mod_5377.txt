Assigned Pathologist [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) 488**] P. Please contact the pathology department, [**Name (NI) **] [**Numeric Identifier 1434**] PATHOLOGY # [**Numeric Identifier 75154**] FS right frontal lobe  MR OF THE HEAD DONE ON [**2138-1-30**].
SCAN FINDINGS: As on the previous examination there is a large enhancing mass in the right frontal region with a central area of low signal in the anteromedial frontal lobe.
There is now increased extension of the enhancing mass to the corpus callosum extending to the contralateral side.
There is a slight enlargement of the enhancement within the right frontal lobe as well.
The rapid growth of this lesion is suggestive of recurrent neoplasm although radiation necrosis is not excluded.
No other enhancing lesions within the brain parenchyma are seen.
There is no hydrocephalus.
IMPRESSION: Interval progression in size of right frontal enhancing mass with increased extension to corpus callosum and right frontal lobe.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: The patient is status post repeat right frontal craniotomy and resection with a large focus of pneumocephalus and a small amount of hemorrhage in the resection bed.
Surrounding vasogenic edema is also noted.
There is no shift of normally midline structures, or evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarct.
IMPRESSION: Status post right frontal lobe resection for recurrent glioblastoma with large pneumocephalus and small hemorrhage in the resection cavity.
Surrounding vasogenic edema and effacement of the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] persists.
There is also moderate amount of pneumocephalus, which is slightly decreased compared to the most recent CT scan.
Adjacent edema and mild shift of the midline structures to the left side are not significantly changed.
This can relate to blood products or acute infarction in this location.
There is some enhancement noted in the margins of the surgical resection cavity, assessment of which is somewhat limited due to the the pre-contrast T1 hyperintense appearance and represent blood products and post-surgical changes.
There are areas of enhancement noted in the right inferior lobe, extending inferior to the resection cavity margins, which represent some residual tumor (series 13, image 12).
Enhancement of the dura, likely represents post-surgical changes and can be evaluated at followup.
Areas of restricted diffusion, in the posteromedial aspect of the surgical resection cavity, may represent hemorrhage vs. infarction.
No significant change in the mild shift of the midline structures to the left side, and less surrounding edema.
Mild decrease in the pneumocephalus.
On POD#1, the patient was awake, alert and oriented X3 with no deficits.
His MRI was completed and appeared to have a gross total resection.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
F.   Followup Instructions: Please return to the office in [**6-6**] days from [**2138-1-30**](from the date of your surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and a wound check.
