Admission Date:  [**2116-5-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2116-6-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2046-7-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**] Chief Complaint: CC: Transferred from OSH for management of respiratory failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: Pt is a 69 yo M with h/o myelofibrosis, hepatosplenomegaly, COPD who is transferred here from [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) 1459**] for further management of his hemoptysis, CHF, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia.
He initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**2116-5-1**] with complaints of weakness, inability to walk and shortness of breath x 1 week.
He was also noted to have a RLL opacity on CXR thus was started ceftriaxone on [**5-3**].
Sputum culutre grew out Klebsiella pneumonia and he was switched from Ceftriaxone to avelox on [**5-5**].
He then developed hemoptysis in the setting of thrombocytopenia, however per family he has had small amounts of hemoptysis for the past 6 months.
From a respiratory standpoint he was still saturating well at this point, however CT chest on [**5-7**] showed extensive ground glass infiltrates in the right lung field and scattered on the left.
Given the worsening hemoptysis concern was for DAH vs CHF vs PNA.
He had persistent hemoptysis and required blood and platelet transfusions.
Then on [**5-10**] he had acute onset of respiratory distress.
CXR showed patchy infiltrates with no obvious CHF.
CXR showed pulm edema vs ARDS.
Past Medical History: Myeloproliferative Disorder/Myelofibrosis with anemia and thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 66973**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 66974**]).
BM biopsy in [**2115**] c/w myeloproliferative, myelofibrosis and myelodysplasia.

ECG- NSR- 93, nl axis, nl intervals, TWF in III, II, avF (old), no ST, TW changes from old ECG .
CXR: diffuse interstitial infiltrates bilaterally and fluffy alveolar infiltrates in the right lung, small left pleural effusion.
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The gallbladder is not distended and there is no evidence of stones or sludge.
There is a mild amount of pericholecystic fluid.
There is mild gallbladder wall thickening.
The liver demonstrates no focal textural abnormalities.
While this can be seen in cholecystitis, there are no other findings to support this (such as gallstones or gallbladder distention) the differential diagnosis includes hypoalbuminemia, CHF, cirrhosis, pancreatitis and hepatitis.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 year-old man with history of myelofibrosis, COPD and hepatosplenomegaly who was initially transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) 1459**] for management of hemoptysis, CHF, respiratory failure, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia and who is now being transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] for tracheostomy and PEG placement.
The patient initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2116-5-1**] with complaints of weakness, inability to walk and shortness of breath for one week.
He was also noted to have a RLL opacity on CXR and on [**2116-5-3**] was started on ceftriaxone.
A sputum culutre grew out Klebsiella pneumonia and he was switched from Ceftriaxone to moxifloxacin on [**5-5**].
He then developed hemoptysis in the setting of thrombocytopenia, although according to family members he has had small amounts of hemoptysis for the past 6 months.
A CT chest on [**5-7**] showed extensive ground glass infiltrates in the right lung field and scattered on the left.
Given the worsening hemoptysis, there was a concern for DAH vs CHF vs PNA.
He had persistent hemoptysis and required blood and platelet transfusions.
On [**5-10**] he had the acute onset of respiratory distress with new hypoxia.
CXR showed patchy infiltrates with no obvious CHF.
CXR showed pulm edema vs ARDS.
Sputum cultures from [**5-12**] grew MRSA and he was started on vancomycin and zosyn on [**2116-5-11**].
A bronchoscopy was performed on [**2116-5-15**] which revealed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
PCWP remained elevated in 14-15 range, suggesting coexisting congestive heart failure and the patient was diuresed.
After extubation he had stable oxygen saturations on 4L and he was called out to the floor, but at that time had another episode of respiratory distress and stayed in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
He did well until [**5-26**] when had tachypnea and hypoxia and was reintubated.
He was recently placed on a lasix drip on [**5-29**] for volume overload, with reasonable urine output but this was stopped today due to hypernatremia and hypokalemia.
However, Oncology noted the extrememly poor prognosis from his underlying disease, as well as the lack of realistic treatments other than bone marrow transplant for which he is not a candidate.
