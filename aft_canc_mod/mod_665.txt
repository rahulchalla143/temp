CT T-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2142-11-13**] 7:41 PM  CT T-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  Reason: please eval for progression of met disease, spine integrity  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 48 year old woman with known metastatic thyroid cancer to T2 and lungs with new b/l UE and LE 4/5 weakness and tingling and numbness REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please eval for progression of met disease, spine integrity CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: 48-year-old female with metastatic thyroid cancer to the T2 vertebral body and lungs with weakness and tingling in the upper and lower extremities.
Evaluate for metastatic disease.
There is persistant vertebral plana with a focal kyphosis of the T2 vertebral body with more extensive lytic lesions of the right T2 pedicle and lamina.
The soft tissue mass along the right posterior aspect of the T2 vertebral body, extending into the bony spinal canal appears slightly increased in size, causing severe canal stenosis.
There has been slight interval increase in size of the lucent lesion along the right superior endplate of T3 indicating this likely represents extension of the metastatic lesion.
There are multiple scattered pulmonary nodules throughout the lungs similar in size and number, consistent with diffuse metastatic disease.
IMPRESSION: Progression of osseous metastatic disease involving the T1-T3 vertebral bodies with associated increase in size of the soft tissue lytic lesion at the level of the T2 causing worsened (severe) spinal canal stenosis.
An MRI would provide much better evaluation of soft tissue extension and cord and nerve root compression.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2142-11-14**] 7:11 PM  CHEST (PA & LAT)  Reason: please evaluate for pulmonary infiltrates  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 48 year old woman with metastatic ca to spine, presenting with low grade fever and elevated WBC REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please evaluate for pulmonary infiltrates TWO-VIEW CHEST [**2142-11-14**]  COMPARISON: [**2142-8-23**].
INDICATION: Metastatic cancer.
Fever and elevated white blood cell count.
Multiple small nodules are present throughout both lungs, most prominent in the mid and lower lungs, measuring up to about a centimeter in diameter.
Biapical thickening appears unchanged.
No pleural effusions are identified.
Known metastatic disease to the upper thoracic spine is not well demonstrated radiographically.
IMPRESSION: Multiple small pulmonary nodules, highly suspicious for metastatic disease.
MR THORACIC SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2142-11-14**] 5:07 AM  MR THORACIC SPINE W/O CONTRAST  Reason: eval for cord compression  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 48 year old woman with recent surgeyr, inc pain REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for cord compression CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
Additional information from the online medical record indicates that the patient has a history of metastatic disease with cancer to the T2 vertebral body.
FINDINGS: Redemonstrated is vertebra plana of the T2 vertebral bony with abnormal low signal on T1-weighted imaging within the marrow of the T1 vertebral body and superior portion of the T3 vertebral body secondary to metastatic involvement.
Abnormal signal extends into the posterior elements at these levels and there is a large soft tissue component extending posteriorly along the right side of the spinal canal.
Although the axial images are degraded by patient motion, they still demonstrate severe compression of the spinal cord at the T2 level and severe compression of the exiting neural foramen at these levels.
Spinal cord compression has increased from [**2142-10-5**] though the cord maintains normal signal characteristics.
Inversion recovery images demonstrate abnormal high signal within the T3 vertebral body and posterior soft tissues from T1 to T3 that represent reactive changes.
Rocal kyphosis at this level has also worsened from [**2142-10-5**].
IMPRESSION: Metastatic vertebra plana of T2 and additional metastases involving T1 and T3 with worsening severe spinal cord compression secondary to an enlarging large soft tissue component.
Close observation is recommended given the extent of spinal cord compression.
FINDINGS:  As noted on the prior examination from [**2142-11-14**], there is metastatic vertebra plana of T2 with extensive epidural tumor causing circumferential narrowing and encasement of the spinal cord.
There is mild cord compression at this level, without abnormal cord signal present.
There are mild spondylotic changes in the cervical spine.
Evaluation of the lumbar spine demonstrates no evidence for abnormal marrow signal or pathologic compression.
There is no abnormality within the thecal sac.
IMPRESSION:  Severe vertebra plana at T2 with cord compression.
Also evidence for metastatic involvement at T1 and T3.
Previous biopsies:    [**Numeric Identifier 18271**]  LEFT & RIGHT THYROID LOBE, MODIFIED RADICAL NECK   [**Numeric Identifier 18272**]  LEFT LYMPH NODE CERVICAL/jf/3.
These findings (in particular, positive nuclear TTF-1 and negative for thyroglobulin) are not typical of a thyroidal primary and suggest a lung origin for this metastasis.
Frozen section diagnosis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] is: "Bony and soft tissue with reactive changes; no malignancy identified; sampling very limited because of bone content".
A portion was frozen with a frozen section diagnosis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of: "Epithelial aggregate admixed with dense reactive tissue consistent with metastatic carcinoma; this tumor does not look like typical papillary thyroid carcinoma.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2142-11-17**] 8:10 PM  CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-  Reason: 48 F w/ metastatic thyroid CA, s/p T1-T3 corpectomy for meta  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 48 year old woman with thyroid CA, mets to thoracic spine REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: 48 F w/ metastatic thyroid CA, s/p T1-T3 corpectomy for metastatic lesion, POD 2, now w/ acute O2 desaturation, r/o PE CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: 48-year-old woman with thyroid cancer and metastatic disease to the thoracic spine.
TECHNIQUE: CTA CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  COMPARISONS: No prior chest CTs are available for comparison.
CTA CHEST: There are multiple bilateral PEs.
There are partially occlusive thrombi in both main pulmonary arteries.
Multiple clots cause near occlusion of the right lower lobe branches.
There is near occlusive thrombosis of a segmental right middle lobe branch and the right upper lobe branch.
On the left, there is partial occlusion of all lower lobe pulmonary artery branches as well as lingular segmental branch and a clot at the origin of the left upper lobe branches with patency distally.
There is bilateral dependent atelectasis and there is a small right-sided pleural effusion.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Multiple pulmonary metastases are seen throughout all lobes of the lung with lower lobe predominance.
The patient is status post T1- T3 corpectomy for metastases and there is a fixation plate with screws in T3 and T1 vertebral bodies transbridging T2.
A large metastatic mass causes destruction of nearly the entire T2 vertebral body and posterior elements and partially also of T3 and T1.
There is invasion of the mass into the spinal canal and encasement of the spinal cord at these levels.
There is a 2 x 2 cm area of abnormal soft tissue superior to the aortic knob in the left apical mediastinum likely representing a small hematoma related to the recent surgery.
Several small bubbles of air are seen adjacent to the midline sternotomy and there is some stranding in the adjacent chest wall soft tissues, expected post-surgical changes.
No acute pathology is seen in the partially visualized abdominal organs.
Massive bilateral PEs with involvement of branches to all lobes.
Bilateral dependent atelectasis and small right pleural effusion.
No apparent pulmonary infarcts.
Innumerable metastatic nodules in both lungs.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-18**] through 15:  Left lower lobe atelectasis and small left basal pleural effusion have increased since [**11-19**].
No pneumothorax.
Multiple nodules seen in the right lower lung presumably metastases.
woman with pmh significant for metastatic thyroid cancer, s/p median sternotomy, T1 & T2 Corpectomy w/ T1-T3 Fusion/Cage, with bilateral pulmonary embolism, being transferred to medicine for optimization of anticoagulation.
#)Pulmonary Embolism: Patient was found to have bilateral PE after surgery, is s/p IVC filter and being anticoagulated with coumadin after bridged with heparin drip.
#)Papillary thyroid cancer s/p thyroidectomy: The patient was continued on levothyroxine.
