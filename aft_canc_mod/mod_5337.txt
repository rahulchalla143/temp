Over the past week, he developed progressive dyspnea on exertion, SOB, and called EMS today.
A CXR done at [**Hospital3 **] found a new hydropneumothorax and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
He experienced transient hypotension to the 90s/50s and was bolused 1L NS prior to arrival in the MICU.
Past Medical History:  1) Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the lung dx'ed in [**12/2134**]; Received whole brain radiation, palliative radiation of lumbrosacral spine in 04/[**2134**].
Family History: Brother diagnosed with leukemia at 54.
Left Chest Tube insertion site without erythema or tenderness CV: Tachycardic, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g ABD: thin, NTND, +b/s, soft, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly EXT: no edema.
Chest x-ray [**2135-5-18**]- 1) New left chest tube does not lie within small apical pneumothorax.
2) Known lung malignancy with possible asymmetric edema (or lymphangitic carcinomatosis) at right lung base.
Chest x-ray [**2135-5-18**] - Moderate to large left hydropneumo- (or hemopneumo-) thorax superimposed on right upper lobe mass and bihilar and parenchymal metastatic disease.
EKG [**2135-5-18**] - Sinus tachycardia.
Possible right atrial abnormality.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Cytology pleural fluid [**2135-5-18**] - NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS .

Brief Hospital Course: 46 y/o M with a PMHx of metastatic squamous cell CA s/p WBXRT and palliative XRT of L/S spine admitted with respiratory distress due to hemo/pneumothorax.
Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure Pt had a known hx of a recently diagnosed pneumothorax 1 week prior at [**Hospital6 **].
In the interim he developed progressive worsening of respiratory distress and was admitted for closer monitoring to the ICU.
Respiratory decline was thought to be likely multifactorial from PTX and known pulmonary tumor burden as well as known thromboembolic disease burden.
Pulmonary Embolism LENIs done on HD#2 showed large burden of bilateral LE clot despite being on Lovenox.
This likely represented a breakthrough clot despite anticoagulation and was most likely due to his cancer.
Oncology felt that placing an IVC filter was not clinically indicated given his overall poor prognosis, and after a discussion with the pt and family, he agreed not to proceed with an IVC filter placement.
Metastatic Squamous Cell CA Followed by thoracic oncologist [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Given his clinical picture, the tumor appears to be progressing despite treatment.
Dexamethasone 4mg [**Hospital1 **] taper for likely prevention of brain edema given mets was started with Bactrim given for PCP prevention while on steroids.
Hyponatremia Profoundly dehydrated on admission, with Na 130, Cl 88.
On HD#2, developed Na drop to 125.
Likely due to brain metastases as well as lung CA.
Thrombocytopenia Due to chemo regimen; s/p 1u plts in ED prior to CT placement .
Elevated WBC: No evidence of PNA on CXR  Likely due to chronic steroid therapy.
