Admission Date:  [**2198-5-8**]              [**Month/Day/Year **] Date:   [**2198-5-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2143-12-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: lumbar puncture [**2198-5-8**] Dobhoff tube placement [**2198-5-14**] PICC line placement [**2198-5-21**]  History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 33754**] is a 54-year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma (due to start cycle 7 monthly temozolomide on [**2198-5-7**]) and recent right superficial femoral DVT and s/p IVC filter placement who presents from rehabilitation with fevers, altered mental status, and poor urine output.
Until [**2198-4-30**] she was "communicating very well" per husband, although nursing notes say patient only oriented to self with significant word-finding difficulties.
Chart from rehabilitation also notes many episodes of agitation/emotional lability.
According to husband, on [**2198-5-1**] someone "flipped a switch" and she from then on has had very poor mental status, has been agitated, confused, not eating or drinking, etc.
She was febrile over the weekend to 100 and found to have an E. coli UTI (culture on [**2198-5-4**]) at rehabilitation with WBC of 20.
on [**2197-6-2**] demonstrating primary central nervous system lymphoma, (3) s/p 4 induction cycles of high-dose methotrexate started on [**2197-6-5**], (4) s/p 2 doses of rituximab and high-dose methotrexate for progressive disease, (5) s/p whole brain cranial irradiation from [**2197-7-8**] to [**2197-7-27**] to 3,600 cGy for progressive disease, (6) s/p readmission to Medicine Service from [**2197-8-8**] to [**2197-8-11**] for UTI, (7) s/p admission to OMED Service for DVT and PE from [**2197-9-29**] to [**2197-10-4**], (8) s/p hospitalization in OMED from [**2197-10-10**] to [**2197-10-12**] due to purulent [**Month/Day/Year **] from her Portacath, (9) s/p hospitalization for septic shock from [**2198-4-14**] to [**2198-4-23**], and (10) s/p 6 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide at 200 mg/m2/day x 5 days starting from [**2197-10-3**].
- Prior gram positive bacteremia - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - s/p oophorectomy - Bilateral lower lobe PEs ([**9-30**]) - Left lower extremity DVT ([**9-30**]) - Recent pelvic DVT  Social History: She lives with husband.
Family History: Her father is alive with diabetes and s/p coronary stent placement.
HEENT:  Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear NECK:  Supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops ABDOMEN:  Soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly EXTREMITIES:  Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, 3+ BLE edema  NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION (performed on Hospital Day 3):  Her Karnofsky Performance Score is 50.
Motor Examination:  She has minimal volitional movements of her extremities.
Within these limitations, there is a left basal effusion and a probable infiltrate at the left lung base.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
No evidence of acute intra-abdominal pathology/colitis.
Moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions.
Small amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
No acute hemorrhage or infarction.
Stable post-radiation, and post-surgical changes.
[**2198-5-8**] LEFT UENI (prelim): No evidence of left upper extremity DVT.
FINDINGS:  There is no evidence for acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or acute vascular territorial infarction.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
There is no abnormal susceptibility to suggest presence of blood products.
No abnormal diffusion to suggest acute ischemia.
Extensive white matter changes, bilaterally, but more prominent on the left, reflect prior radiation treatment and are stable.
Following the administration of intravenous contrast, there is no focus of abnormal parenchymal, leptomeningeal or dural enhancement identified.
Slight T1 hyperintensity in the left base on pre-contrast imaging is also unchanged, and again this demonstrates no enhancement.
Mucosal thickening in the bilateral maxillary sinuses is new from prior studies.
The ethmoid sinus disease has progressed in severity.
Mucosal disease is also identified in the bilateral frontal sinuses, and bilateral mastoid air cells.
No evidence for enhancing lesions following administration of intravenous contrast to suggest progression of CNS lymphoma.
Stable appearance of diffuse post-radiation white matter change.
Worsening diffuse mucosal sinus disease, now involving the bilateral maxillary, frontal, and ethmoid air cells, and there is also partial opacification again demonstrated in the bilateral mastoids.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 33754**] is a 54-year-old woman with primary CNS lymphoma, history of PE with IVC filter no anticoagulation since thrombocytopenic, E coli UTI on vancomycin and cefepime, presents with acute mental status changes secondary to radiation encephalopathy.
CNS lymphoma appears to be relatively controlled and CT/MR scan does not show progressive disease.
EEG showed some sharp activities in the left frontal lobe of the EEG, leading to an increase in Keppra 1000 mg IV TID.
UTI:  This occurred in setting of previous chronic indwelling Foley.
Left Arm Erythema and Right Arm Swelling:  Differential diagnosis included cellulitis versus thrombopheblitis.
Plastics was consulted and aside from the patient's antibiotics she was initially on for UTI, she was treated with right hand elevation on [**12-26**] pillows at all times and a splint, which was ultimately discontinued due to slight decrease in perfusion of her extremity and weak pulse.
Hypothyroidism may contribute to altered mental status.
Primary CNS lymphoma:  Being treated with adjuvant Temodar after whole brain radiation.
Poor Urine Output:  Initially the patient had decreased UOP with slightly elevated creatinine, however, this improved and was adequate for the last few days before [**Date Range **].
Thrombocytopenia:  There is a drop in platelets not associated with heparin products in terms of timing.
Per discussion with neuro-oncology, timing suggestive of effect from temodar.
History of Venous Thromboembolism with DVT and PE with IVC filter:  Although it appears that her thrombocytopenia was due to her chemotherapy, her Lovenox was held during the latter part of her admission.
Her platelet count was greater than 200 on [**Date Range **], and HIT antibody was negative.
FEN:  Gentle IVF given low albumin and anasarca.
Miconazole Nitrate 2 % Powder Sig: One (1) Appl Topical TID (3 times a day) as needed for yeast infection.

[**Year (4 digits) **] Instructions: You were admitted for altered mental status.
You were found to have a urinary tract infection and there was concern for sepsis and you were placed on broad spectrum antitbiotics.
You were noted to have some seizure activity and your antiseizure meds were increased.
You had a repeat brain MRI that showed diffuse post-radiation white matter change without evidence of new diseas.
Please contact your physician if you have fevers, hypotension, another urinary tract infection, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or any other concerning symptoms.
