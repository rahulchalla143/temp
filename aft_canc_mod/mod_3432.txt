Admission Date:  [**2111-4-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2111-6-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2035-10-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3507**] Chief Complaint: Renal failure and Hyperkalemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Nephrostomy tube replacement X 3 and removal Pecutaneous Liver bx Tunneled Hemodialysis Line placement Nephrogram with balloon tamponade Renal Angiogram   History of Present Illness: 75 y.o.
M with h/o transition cell cancer of the bladder in [**2105**] s/p resection and treated with postop BCG therapy, who was diagnosed wtih TCC of the R kidney in [**9-/2110**] when he developed hematuria.
After his third weekly treatment, two weeks ago he developed increased weakness, chills, low grade temps, + sweats, increased passage of clots in the nephrectomy tube and the penis.
These symptoms were thought to be secondary to the IFN.
Five days prior to admission his nephrostomy tube stopped draining, he developed a cough, dry heaves, +anorexia and 10lb weight loss.
+ difficulty generating urinary stream.
Given his constitutional symptoms, his bloodwork was checked today which demonstrated a leukocytosis of 30 K, anemia with HCT = 22, Cr = 15.8.
These symptoms persisted and thus today in urology clinic his nephrostomy was changed.
ECG in the ED demonstrated NSR without acute changes.
A foley catheter was placed and it drained 200 cc of bloody urine.
denied pruritis or ocular swelling.
Denied headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied shortness of breath.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
No diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias   Past Medical History: TCC s/p TUR in [**2105**] and 6 treatments of BCG followed with yearly negative cystoscopies [**1-21**] s/p Right renal exploration, right pyelotomy, open excision of right renal pelvic tumor, right ureteral stent removal and right nephrostomy tube placement.
L atrophic kidney due to likely obstruction and pyelonephrosis   Social History: Lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) 7658**], MA.
HEENT: NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI without nystagmus, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in OP Neck: supple, no JVD or carotid bruits appreciated Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
No abnormal movements noted.
-cerebellar: No nystagmus, dysarthria, intention or action tremor, dysdiadochokinesia noted.
No hydronephrosis or mass is noted.
MRI Brain MRI OF THE BRAIN: There is no evidence of acute brain ischemia.
There is mild brain atrophy, resulting in slight sulcal and ventricular prominence.
There is no abnormal signal within the brain parenchyma.
Magnetic susceptibility artifact is seen in the area of the medial right maxillary sinus anteriorly, which may relate to some sort of metal in this localization.
MRA OF THE BRAIN: There is no area of hemodynamically significant stenosis, or aneurysmal dilation within the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] or its major branches.
There is no evidence of arteriovenous malformation.
No evidence of acute brain ischemia.
Chronic paranasal sinus disease as described above.
No evidence of aneurysm or significant stenosis within the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] .
MRI Abdomen: FINDINGS: There has been interval development of multiple metastatic lesions throughout all lobes of the liver measuring up to 1.8 cm in size.
Tumor or clot within the collecting system extends down to the level of the right ureterovesicular junction.
Additionally, this tumor invades the right renal vein and extends superiorly into the infrahepatic IVC to approximately 2.5 cm below the junction of the right hepatic vein with the cava.
There is no invasion into the hepatic veins or right atrium.
Additionally, there is direct invasion of tumor through the right renal venous wall into the surrounding perivenous fat.
Right paracolic gutter peritoneal metastasis measures 2.0 cm in short axis dimension.
There are multiple enlarged pericaval and periaortic lymph nodes, the largest of which is best seen on series 3, image 8, measuring 2.3 cm in maximal width.
There is no evidence for osseous metastatic disease.
There is trace abdominal ascites.
The remainder of the abdominal viscera, the left adrenal gland, pancreas, and spleen are unremarkable on this limited non-contrast evaluation.
IMPRESSION: Marked interval progression of primary tumor with new metastases.
infiltrating expansile right renal transitional cell carcinoma extending into the right renal vein and the hepatic IVC approximately 2.5 cm below the venous confluence.
Multiple hepatic metastases, bulky enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, mesenteric lymph nodes, and at least one peritoneal deposit is also seen.
Metastatic carcinoma, poorly differentiated, consistent with urothelial origin (see comment).
The tumor resembles that seen in this patient's prior biopsy, S07-8064 (right renal pelvic tumor).
Brief Hospital Course: Acute renal failure due to obstructive uropathy:  given elevated Cr on admission and obstructive uropathy, patient underwent placement of tunneled HD line.
Nephrectomy not felt to be an option given metastatic disease.
Metastatic bladder transitional cell cancel (to liver, retroperitoneum):  pt underwent U/S guided liver bx which confirmed metastatic TCC.
The MRI of Abdomen also revealed interval progression of primary tumor with new metastases.
Bulky enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, mesenteric lymph nodes, and at least one peritoneal deposit were also seen.
Seen by primary urologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who felt that the patient no longer had surgical options for resection given metastatic disease.
Outpatient Lab Work CBC, Chem7, Ca/Mg/Phos Please send to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16968**] office   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Acute renal failure due to obstructive uropathy  Secondary: Hematuria, Metastatic bladder transitional cell cancer (to liver, retroperitoneum), chronic blood loss anemia, urinary tract infection   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with acute renal failure due to urinary obstruction.
3) Please contact your primary care doctor or come to the emergency room if you develop decreased urinary output, blood or clots in your urine, abdominal pain, fevers, chills, or other symptoms that concern you.
