Colonoscopy: Findings:  Mucosa: Mild melanosis was noted in the sigmoid colon.
Excavated Lesions Multiple non-bleeding diverticula were seen in the sigmoid colon.
Diverticulosis appeared to be of mild severity.
Impression: Mild melanosis in the sigmoid colon Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations: poor prep - will need routine screening [**Last Name (un) **] as outpatient.
no bleeding site identified and no blood seen in colon .
Brief Hospital Course: # GIB: Given melena concerning for upper GI source but NGL negative and also has the blood clots and h/o colon fibroma which if on the right and bleeding very slowly may be the source of the melena and clots more likely from lower source.
GI decided to do EGD and colonoscopy both of which did not reveal a site of active bleeding (see reports above).
Pt was transferred to the floor and continued to be hemodynamically stable, not requiring any more units of blood and symptoms resolved.
Per GI, will follow up outpatient at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) **] for [**Location (un) 87517**] endoscopy vs small bowel follow through to try identify source of bleeding (may be neurofibromas in small bowel vs other small bowel causes vs diverticular bleeding now resolved).
# GERD: On PPI IV for suspected upper GIB, which was discontinued prior to discharge.
Patient reports no symptoms of this for several months.
# SVT: Given GIB and possibility of hypotension from this verapamil was initially held and pt had tachycardia to 120s.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: GI bleed - source not identified  Secondary: GERD SVT Diverticulosis neurofibromatosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with black tarry stools and a decreased hematocrit indicative of chronic GI bleeding.
There was no source of bleeding found though we visualized your long-term divericulosis, no colonic neurofibromas were visualized.
Please continue to take your verapamil to control heart rate but do not take aspirin until your GI appointment.
