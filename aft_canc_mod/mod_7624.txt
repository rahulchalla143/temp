**FINAL REPORT [**2191-4-25**]**     Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2191-4-25**]):       NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
A negative result does not rule out infection due to other L.       pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.
PICC LINE PLACMENT SCH  Reason: PICc for antibiotics  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 80 year old man with sepsis and UTI, pneumonia and ulcers in feet/osteomyelitis REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: PICc for antibiotics PICC LINE PLACEMENT  INDICATION: IV access needed for antibiotics.
Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after establishing intravenous access.
There were no immediate complications.
FOOT AP,LAT & OBL BILAT; ANKLE (AP, MORTISE & LAT) [**Last Name (un) **]  Reason: assess for osteomyelitis  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 80 year old man with chronic ulcers in foot/heel and concern for osteomyelitis REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: assess for osteomyelitis BOTH FEET AND ANKLES  FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2188-4-25**], there has been loss of the soft tissues about the posterior aspect of the calcaneus bilaterally.
The calcaneus itself shows sclerosis involving the posterior aspect on the right and much of the bone on the left.
In view of the soft tissue changes and history of diabetes, chronic osteomyelitis must be strongly considered.
On the left, there is a bizarre appearance of the metatarsal heads and phalanges.
Striking hammertoes are seen as well as apparent erosive change involving the head of the first metatarsal and displacement of the proximal phalanx.
There also appears to be virtually no soft tissue covering the residual head of the first metatarsal on this side.
IMPRESSION: Severe changes involving the calcaneus bilaterally with loss of overlying soft tissues and probable chronic osteomyelitis.
Disorganization of the phalanges of the left toe with probable osteomyelitic change and loss of soft tissues about the head of the first metatarsal.
SACRUM/COCCYX  [**2191-4-26**] 7:28 PM  SACRUM/COCCYX  Reason: assess for osteomyelitis  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 80 year old man with chronic ulcers in foot/heel/ sacrum and concern for osteomyelitis REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: assess for osteomyelitis HISTORY: Chronic ulcers in foot, heel, and sacrum, suggestive of osteomyelitis.
FINDINGS: No evidence of bone abnormality.
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2191-4-23**]  7:58:16 AM   Sinus tachycardia with premature atrial contractions.
Left atrial abnormality.
Poor R wave progression.
HISTORY: Change in mental status.
FINDINGS: There is a small left-sided pleural effusion.
Increased retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms is concerning for a left lower lobe pneumonia.
There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity concerning for infection     Brief Hospital Course: 80 year old man with hx of multiple sclerosis c/b paraplegia, DM2, PUD, agitated depression, and aspiration presenting from nursing home after being found unresponsive, hypotensive, hypoxic, and with evidence of GI bleed.
#  Septic Shock: Patient was admitted with a lactate of 5.4, bandemia (21 bands) and signs of end-organ dysfunction (mental status and elevated Cr) in setting of likely infection, so sepsis was the most likely etiology.
[**Month (only) 116**] also be complicated by a GI bleed as patient has had significant UGIB in the past.
Diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and UTI, proteus.
# Acute blood loss anemia on admission: patient has hx of severe PUD with gastritis and visible vessel now with BRBPR and decrease (although mild) in Hct.
No acute bleed noted.
# Altered Mental status: Was likely due to above issues and improved to baseline by discharge.
# Acute renal failure: likely pre-renal +/- ATN.
# Chronic osteomyelitis of both feet - evaluated by podiatry and ID who recommended wound care.
No acute surgical intervention recommended.
# Aspiration precautions maintained - Seen by Speech and swallow consult and they recommended ground solids and thick liquids initially and then advanced to this liquids.
