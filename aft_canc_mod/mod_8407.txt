He felt this pain may have been his GERD but did not improve with tums.
new anterior-lateral changes.
Repeat EKG was still non-ischemic and cardiology felt his troponins were not due to active ischemia.
Given his platelets, there were no plans for intervention.
Heme/onc was consulted to review his smear given concern for acute leukemia.
Patient was given one sublingual nitro and started on morphine for pain control.
He was moving very little air on exam and felt to be having a COPD exacerbation.
In the ICU, he endorses having had chest pain for the past couple weeks that he felt was heartburn and epigrastric pain.
Over this time period, he has also had some generalized weakness and cough productive of blood tinged sputum.
Past Medical History: # Pneumonia that was slow to resolve, requiring 2-3 months of ABX [**9-21**] # COPD with 2L home O2 # History of asbestos exposure # psoriasis # hyperlipidemia # arthritis # hypertension # depression # venous insufficiency  Social History: He is married and has a daughter who is his HCP.
Family History: Mother had unspecified mental illness and had a coronary artery bypass.
His father with unknown cancer died at the age of 83.

This limited/ incomplete study may not rule out mosaicism at a level that is standard for such an analysis.
Abnormal cells comprise 82% of total gated events.
Cell marker analysis demonstrates that the majority of the cells isolated from this peripheral blood express myeloid associated antigens (CD13, CD33 (bright), CD15 (bright, subset), express CD64, CD71, lack B and T cell associated antigens, are CD10 (cALLAa) negative, and are negative for CD34, HLA-DR, CD14, CD41, CD11C, CD56 and Glycophorin A.  Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by acute myeloid leukemia.
Lack of CD34 and HLA-DR [**Last Name (STitle) **] promyelocytic differentiation.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, with some regional variation (the anterior septum, anterior free wall, and apex appearing more hypokinetic than the other walls) (LVEF = 30 %).
with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST   [**2148-9-23**] 6:31 PM IMPRESSION: Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe, with surrounding vasogenic edema and local mass effect.
A hypodense lesion with smaller hemorrhagic component is also seen in the right occipital lobe, with two additional non-hemorrhagic hypodense lesions seen in the left cerebellar hemisphere and the right parieto-occipital cortex.
Given the multifocality of these lesions, and history of malignancy, these may represent metastases with associated hemorrhage.
MRI with and without contrast would be helpful for further evaluation.
MRI BRAIN    [**2148-9-24**] 3:27 PM CONCLUSION: Multiple acute areas of infarction, many with hemorrhage.
The distribution suggests emboli from a proximal source, most likely cardiac.
5-6 mm anterior communicating artery aneurysm.
Within the limits of an adequate but not optimal MRA examination, no other intracranial vascular abnormalities are detected.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM   [**2148-9-25**] at 1:30:32 PM   Conclusions: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is small vegetation (4mm) on the mitral valve attached to the posterior leaflet on the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
Mild to moderate ([**12-16**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Small vegetation of the mitral valve.
Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction.
No interval change since [**2148-9-24**], with unchanged appearance of right frontal parenchymal hematoma with associated edema, local mass effect and stable degree of leftward shift of normally-midline structures.
Hypodense lesions in the right occipital and parietal occipital cortex appear grossly unchanged but are not further characterized on this motion- degraded study.
Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) **] of left subclavian, left internal jugular, left axillary, left brachial, left basilic, and left cephalic veins were performed.
There is abnormal flow in the left subclavian vein, left axillary vein, and left basilic vein.
Hypoechoic foci consistent with clots are also clearly visualized in the left basilic and left axillary veins.
These findings are consistent with an upper extremity thrombus in the left subclavian vein, left axillary vein, and left basilic vein.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 yo man h/o severe emphysema who presented with a new diagnosis of APML and NSTEMI with EF 30%, s/p intubation [**9-20**] with extubation on [**9-27**], found to have large IPH, multiple strokes, and endocarditis.
He also received steroids initially for prophylaxis of ATRA syndrome and this was gradually weaned.
# NSTEMI with new heart failure (EF 35%): Mr. [**Known lastname 104371**] initially presented to his PCP's office with chest pain.
He had elevated troponins on admission with no ST or T wave changes on EKG, c/w NSTEMI.
His first ECHO showed moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, with some regional variation (the anterior septum, anterior free wall, and apex appearing more hypokinetic than the other walls) and LVEF = 30 %.
He was monitored on telemetry and had no significant arrhythmias.
Repeat ECHO on [**2148-9-25**] showed a persistent small vegetation of the mitral valve, complex, non-mobile atheroma of the aortic arch, and mild regional LV systolic dysfunction (EF 45%).
# Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: On the morning of [**2148-9-23**], it was noted that Mr. [**Known lastname 104371**] was not moving his L arm.
CT head showed a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe, with surrounding vasogenic edema and local mass effect.
A hypodense lesion with smaller hemorrhagic component was also seen in the right occipital lobe, with two additional non-hemorrhagic hypodense lesions seen in the left cerebellar hemisphere and the right parieto-occipital cortex.
MRI/A on [**2148-9-24**] revealed multiple areas of acute infarction, many with hemorrhage, with a distribution that suggests emboli from a proximal source, likely cardiac.
Unclear etiology for embolism ??????
blood cultures are negative to date to assess for bacteremia.
TEE showed aortic plaque that could be potential embolic source.
MRA showed a 5-6mm communicating artery aneurysm as well.
Neurology was consulted & recommended EEG which showed a diffuse encephalopathy pattern and a focal area with epileptogenic potential, but no electrographic seizures.
# Respiratory Distress/Hypoxia: On presentation, he was hypoxic and required oxygen support by nasal cannula (up to 6L).
It was felt to be multifactorial, with his underlying emphysema, acute systolic heart failure, pulmonary edema, and pneumonia contributing.
Bronchoscopy on [**2148-9-26**] showed edematous airways with friability but no frank blood.
# Culture-negative endocarditis:  ECHO on [**2148-9-25**] showed a small vegetation on mitral valve.
Patient had PICC placed in left arm [**2148-9-27**] and his edema was concerning for DVT.
Edema and pain persisted, so a repeat LUE U/S was done on [**2148-10-3**] and showed extensive DVT of the L subclavian, axillary and basilic vein.
