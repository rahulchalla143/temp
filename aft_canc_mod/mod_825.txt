Of note, he was recently admitted [**Date range (2) 19491**] for cellulitis and abscess of the R thigh which was I&D'd on [**5-18**].
He was given vanc/zosyn in the ED for broad coverage, with particular concern for cellulitis spread / abscesses in legs.
ECG showed ST depressions anterolaterally which are similar to prior ECGs.
He had a central line placed for access to continue monitoring hemodynamics and for easy pressor use.
On evaluation in the MICU, patient was very lethargic and attention waxed and waned during exam.
He seemed to be in no acute distress or pain.

Differential included hypovolemia from excessive fluid removal during PD vs. septic shock from infection.
Sources of infection include bacteremia from skin infection given recent abscess/cellulitis vs. abdominal source given ascites and PD catheter in place, although PD fluid is negative for infection on cell counts.
He also had severe cardiac disease with baseline EF 10% at high risk for ACS and arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
He was admitted overnight, maintained on broad spectrum antibiotics and pressors (dopamine which was being weaned down) with improved mental status with lethargy and stable hemodynamics when he had acute event as described below.
At 1:35pm, called to room with acute bradycardia down to HR 40s down from 90s.
Given 1mg atropine x 2, found to be pulseless and code blue called.
Compressions started and cardiac arrest code run per ACLS guidelines for intermittent pulseless vtach and PEA arrest including 4 shocks, epi x 3, amio boluses x 2 and gtt, vasopressin, 4mg IV mag, 2 rounds bicarb, insulin 10units, 1 amp D50.
Unclear cause of death: highest on differential was ACS vs PE vs cardiac tamponade in a patient with poor cardiac function and reserve at baseline.
