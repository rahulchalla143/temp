There were low attenuation capsular lesions along the right lobe of the liver consistent with liver surface implants.
There was a large cystic lesion with some internal septations in the region of the pancreas consistent with a large pancreatic pseudocyst, measuring 13.9 cm in largest dimension.
There were multiple soft tissue masses or calcifications within the uterus consistent with fibroids.
There was no evidence of bowel obstruction.
These findings were felt to be most consistent with ovarian carcinoma.
The patient was discharged after initial evaluation, but has been readmitted twice with increased symptomatic ascites, and ahs undergone two therapeutic paracenteses with good effect.
She states that she has been tolerating a regular diet and having bowel movements and urinating without difficulty.
Has h/o menorrhagia secondary to uterine fibroids.

Postoperative course was notbale for the following issues:  #) Oliguria: The patient had notable postoperative oliguria thought to be due to intravascular depletion and third-spacing.
Hct was stable, and FeNa indicated increased sodium avidity consistent with intravascular volume depletion.
She was asymptomatic, and her ECG revealed no peaked T waves.
The hyperkalemia was presumed due to renal hypoperfusion.
#) GI: The patient was transferred out of the OR with an NGT in place, with a plan to leave it until POD#4 to decompress her stomach and the pseudocyst.
After consultation with general surgery, the NGT was not replaced due to concern about trauma at the suture line.
