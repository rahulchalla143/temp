She had a panendoscopy which revealed gastritis and inflammatory bowel disease.
Patient was placed on Asacol but symptoms persisted.
Preliminary pathology was consistent with non-small cell lung cancer.
Patient reported decreased appetite, nausea and weight loss of 40 pounds.
In the trauma SICU, it was felt that she had a LLL PNA and was started on levofloxacin.
She was also found to be hypertensive after extubation and received on IV hydralazine.
Past Medical History: Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation Migraines Inflammatory Bowel Disease GERD s/p Cholecystectomy   Social History: Lives alone.
Family History: Father died of head and neck cancer, brother and sister have recently been diagnosed with cancer of unknown type.
Brother and sister have ischemic heart disease.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Neck: Supple with no significant JVP elevation.
3/6 systolic murmur at the USB radiating to both carotids.
No thrills, lifts.
CTAB anteriorly, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
Large subcarinal mass (5.7 x 4.8 x 2.8 cm) which is indistinguishable from the esophagus and encases the central bronchi, narrowing the left mainstem bronchus to 4 mm.
Additional mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy including a prevascular node measuring 2.8 x 1.1 cm, a lower left paratracheal node measuring 2 x 1.3cm and 1-cm bilateral hilar lymph nodes.
Spiculated 14-mm left upper lobe lesion which may be neoplastic or inflammatory.
Left lower lobe consolidation, most consistent with pneumonia.
There is a small left pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis.
No lymphadenopathy is detected within the abdomen or pelvis.
Dense calcified atherosclerotic plaque within the descending abdominal aorta and iliac branches.
Emphysema .
MRI head ([**2173-5-30**]): A small amount of chronic microvascular ischemic change without evidence of enhancing abnormality to indicate the presence of intracranial metastatic disease.
Bone scan ([**2173-5-31**]): No scintigraphic evidence of osseous metastases.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 y/o F found to have large lung mass at [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further car, now s/p rigid bronchoscopy with stenting of left main bronchus and biopsy confirming NSCLC.
NSCLC/Lung Mass - Patient was monitored briefly in the trauma ICU after the procedure.
Pathology was consistent with NSCLC.
Transient blood-streaked sputum after bronchoscopy resolved towards the day of discharge.
Megace was continued for poor appetite.
Pneumonia/Leukocytosis - Patient developed leukocytosis in the trauma SICU but was also briefly on stress-dose steroids (for possible cuff leak).
Patient also had intermittent cough with sputum production.
Interventional pulmonology team felt her clinical picture was consistent with PNA.
Sputum culture revealed no growth.
Patient continued to have a cough but remained afebrile and clinically stable.
HTN - Patient was hypertensive post-procedure requiring IV hydral.
Patient remained intermittently hypertensive even after transfer to medicine floor.
She still required Hydral PO as needed for hypertensive episodes but her BP became better controlled towards the end of her hospital stay.
Murmur - systolic murmur at USB with radiation to both carotids.
DDx included AS, HOCM, flow murmur, ?
Murmur disappeared after two days indicating that it was most likely related to flow or transient tissue swelling from the bronchoscopy and stent placement.
Her PCP should monitor for recurrence of this murmur and obtain an echo if needed.
AFib - paroxysmal per OSH records.
She was on no anticoagulation on admission and was kept off any anticoagulation given malignancy workup including uncertainty about brain metastases (prior to acquisition of brain MRI).
Gastritis - Mild chronic gastritis diagnosed at OSH on EGD.
Chronic back pain - Patient underwent MRI study at OSH which showed disc herniation, T8-T10, and incidentally also a 6cm subcarinal mass for which she was referred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Metastatic workup did not reveal any bone lesions (see above).
Patient was given Oxycodone as needed for back pain.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for back pain for 7 days.
Hypertension 3.
Discharge Instructions: You have been transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a so called rigid bronchoscopy for a lung mass which obstructed part of your lung.
You underwent several studies to look for possible spread of the tumor.
Please limit intake and try first tylenol for pain control.
Please call your primary doctor or return to the ED with fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, spontaneous bleeding, bloody cough or blood from the nose or any other concerning symptoms.
