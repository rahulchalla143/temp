There are newly developed bilateral mild-to-moderate pleural effusions with subsequent atelectasis.
However, the signs indicative of pulmonary edema have slightly improved.
There is no extra-axial collection, intracranial hemorrhage, or mass effect.
Streak artifact passes through the region of the left central sulcus.
There is subtle hypodensity in the left caudate, as well as basal ganglia and insular ribbon(series 2; images 14-17).
There is mild prominence of the extra-axial spaces consistent with atrophy, with a predominantly frontal distribution.
Incidental note is made of a lipoma along the anterior falx.
The visualized paranasal sinuses demonstrate minimal mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus as well as several ethmoid air cells, the remainder are clear.
[**9-9**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to inferior hypokinesis and posterior dyskinesis; the other walls are hyperdynamic.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
In the right lobe of the thyroid gland a hypodense lesion measuring aprox.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions are increasing from [**9-6**].
The ascending aorta measures AP 44 mm was 41 mm in [**Month (only) 205**], the descending and visualized portion of the proximal abdominal aorta show dense wall ateromatous calcifications, and probably stable focal mural thrombus at the level of the diaphragm.
There is large bibasilar atelectasis in lower lobes bilaterally and in the right middle lobe, which is almost collapsed.
The aorta is very tortuous and has extensive diffuse atherosclerotic plaques.
This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
The kidneys are atrophic with a hypodense exophytic lesion from the left upper pole kidney unchanged from study.
Hypodense lesion in the left lobe of the liver is barely visualized.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions associated with large bibasilar atelectasis and almost collapse of the right middle lobe.
No evidence of CHF or pneumothorax.
1-cm lesion in the left kidney is unchanged.
Findings concerning for osteomyelitis in the carpus, proximal radiocarpal joint and distal radioulnar joint as questioned.
Degenerative changes as above.
Patent vasculature with resistive indices in the upper, mid and lower pole of the transplant kidney ranging from 0.74 to 0.83 somewhat increased from [**2092**].
No hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collection.
[**9-16**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-9**], there are low lung volumes in this patient with intact midline sternal wires.
Left subclavian catheter extends to about the lower SVC or cavoatrial junction.
The hemidiaphragms are now sharply seen, with mild atelectatic changes at the bases.
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.

Pre-op he received FFP and 2 units PRBC's for an elevated INR and chronic anemia.
Post-operatively, the patient developed acute hypoxia.
This was felt to be multifactorial - from a component of fluid overload (he was several liters positive during and after surgery), probable hospital acquired aspiration pneumonia (with new bandemia and fever) and compressive atelectasis.
His diltiazem was slowly converted to a beta blocker given his history of coronary artery disease as well as some runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia noted on telemetry.
The patient did have new findings on echocardiogram of posterior LV dyskinesia but negative cardiac enzymes and he was felt NOT to have suffered any ischemic cardiac injury.
The patient developed profound altered mental status while in the ICU.
A head CT found possible hypodensity in the left thalamus.
With conservative therapy and limiting of sedating medications, the patient's mental status returned to [**Location 213**] and he had no apparent neurologic deficits.
He may need a MRI of his head in the future.
The patient developed acute onset left wrist pain on [**2100-9-14**].
At the time of discharge, he was not having any left wrist pain.
The patient has a history of renal transplant due to complications of polycystic kidney disease.
It was possible that he has a component of post-obstructive renal failure.
This should be discussed at the time of his renal follow-up.
For his iron deficiency anemia, he received one dose of IV ferrlecit and one dose of feraheme.
The patient has a history of HTN, CAD, DVT/PE on coumadin, chronic anemia and AAA repair.
Incidental: CT chest on [**2100-9-9**] showed a lesion in the right lobe of the thyroid gland.
