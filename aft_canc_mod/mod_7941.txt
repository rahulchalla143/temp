Admission Date:  [**2165-4-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2165-4-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2120-8-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Seizure, Left frontal mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left craniotomy with excision of mass   History of Present Illness: 44 year old gentleman who had a generalized tonic clonic seizure at a [**Hospital1 107**] Day Cookout per witness reports.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital3 **] a head CT was obtained whcih showed a left frontal lesion 3cm x 3cm in size mostly cystic with a hemorrhagic and calcified components.
He currently denies headache, nausea, vomiting,dizziness, difficulty ambulating, changes in bowel or bladder function, or changes in vision, hearing, or speech.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
expressive aphasia MAE's symmetrically following all commands  Pertinent Results: CTA head [**2165-4-22**] Left frontal mass, cystic, with calcification.
More subtle right  frontal lesion is better demonstrated on the subsequent MRI.
The calcified, cystic nature is suggestive of a mucinous gastrointestinal primary.
Multiple cavernomas or an infectious process are less likely, particularly given the MRI appearance.
MRI brain [**2165-4-22**] Large left frontal lobe cystic mass with thick nodular enhancement and dense calcification.
Smaller peripheral right frontal mass.
The multiplicity of the lesions is most suspicious for metastases.
Multiple cavernomas are possible, as there was a prominent subependymal vein draining the left frontal lesion, however, this is less likely given the lack of susceptibility with the smaller right frontal lesion.
[**2165-4-23**] CT torso 1.No definite evidence of malignancy.
Indeterminate right renal lesion for which ultrasound is recommended for further evaluation.
[**2165-4-23**] renal US- Right upper pole simple cyst.
No suspicious renal lesions.
[**2165-4-25**] MRI Head:  Rim-enhancing lesions, a larger one in the left frontal lobe and a smaller in the right frontal lobe are unchanged since the previous MRI examinations.
No definite new abnormalities are seen.
[**2165-4-25**] Head CT: Status post left frontal craniotomy and mass resection without large extra- or intra-axial acute hemorrhage.
final attending comment: the calcified portion of the mass has not been resected.
[**2165-4-26**] MRI head: Hemorrhage in the resection bed limits evaluation for residual tumor.
There is a residual infiltrative component of the tumor in the left frontal lobe that crosses the midline to involve the right frontal lobe, not significantly changed.
A right frontal lobe rim-enhancing lesion is not significantly changed.
Cytotoxic edema along the posterior resection cavity.
No acute large vascular territorial infarction.
He was being treated with Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
CT torso was done for staging revealing an indeterminate right renal lesion and renal US was ordered.
This revealed a cyst and no suspicious lesions.
On [**4-25**] he was taken to the OR and underwent a left craniotomy and mass resection.
Post-operatively, he was taken to the Neuro ICU for q1hour neurochecks and close hemodynamic monitoring.
Although he had a somewhat slow wake up postop, within a few hours, he had mostly cleared, moving all 4 extremities well with some perseveration on questioning.
Post op CT showed no acute hemorrhage with residual calcified portion of the mass.
POD 1 MRI showed hemorrhage in the resection bed which limited evaluation for residual tumor.
There was a residual infiltrative component of the tumor in the left frontal lobe crossing the midline to involve the right frontal lobe, which is not significantly changed with unchanged right frontal lobe rim-enhancing lesion.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7665**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right Frontal Tumor Seizure Fatty Liver Right Renal Lesion   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
