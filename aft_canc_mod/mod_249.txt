There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the septum, inferior, and inferolateral walls.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Bilateral perihilar and bilateral lower lobe opacities are concerning for consolidation due to infectious process or aspiration.
Superimposed edema may also be present.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Bilateral small pleural effusions.
Right pleural effusion is stable since the previous study and the left-sided pleural effusion is slightly increased in size.
Associated bibasilar atelectasis and consolidation, infectious process or aspiration can not be excluded.
Given history of colon cancer, findinces are concerning for metastatic disease, progressed since [**2140-9-20**], as stated on the previous study.
LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLERS [**2141-2-12**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of left lower extremity DVT.
ECHO [**2141-2-15**]: Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2141-2-1**], no change.
Diffuse bronchial wall thickening and peribronchiolar nodular opacities, most prominent in the lower lobes bilaterally, which likely reflect either infectious bronchiolitis or aspiration.
New pulmonary nodule in the left upper lobe, and a growing nodule in the right lower lobe.
These nodules are concerning for possible metastatic lesions.
A three-month followup Chest CT is suggested following appropriate interval antibiotic therapy to assess for interval growth and to also confirm resolution of the above-described airway disease.
New small bilateral pleural effusions.
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, increased in size, which may be reactive in the setting of acute infectious or inflammatory process.
Hepatic hypodensity surrounding a fiducial marker, which appears larger in size compared to prior study and is incompletely evaluated.
Discharge labs: Hct 26.2 Cr 1.9  Brief Hospital Course: 87 year-old man readmitted for evaluation of decreased hematocrit and question of GI bleed.
Pt was hypoxic on admission requiring 3 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula.
He was found to have enterococcal bacteremia likely [**12-20**] PICC line.
No vegetations were seen on the cardiac valves and only one set of blood cultures was positive (for Enterococcus) making infectious endocarditis unlikely.
Left lower extremity doppler was negative.
The patient was afebrile, without leukocytosis, and finishing up treatment for PNA from prior admission, so hypoxia was thought initially be mostly from acute on chronic systolic heart failure.
Pt was admitted with a weight of about 175# and volume overloaded on exam.
He reached a dry weight of 155# when he developed ARF from overdiuresis.
Despite the tremendous diuresis, the patient was still requiring 3L O2 which prompted CT Chest to evaluate for other pulmonary pathology.
Repeat CT Chest revealed aspiration vs PNA and a new small nodule.
Pulmonary consultation was obtained which believes that most of hypoxia likely related to smoldering PNA vs aspiration.
Hypoxia [**12-20**] CHF and PNA.
Continue Chest PT and incentive spirometry.
GIB: Pt with occassional red blood in stool.
Will defer to PCP or oncology to determine if patient if colonoscopy to evaluate for colon cancer recurrence is indicated.
Inpatient colonoscopy not pursued because of stable HCT and also had negative flex sig in [**Month (only) 958**].
Pt has occasional urinary retention from BPH.
New nodules in lung and old nodule increased in size---> could be metastatic disease.
Anemia [**12-20**] chronic GIB: Pt's hematocrit was more or less stable between the range of 26-28.
CAD - had elevated troponin to 0.04 on admission but likely related to relative hypotension and [**Name (NI) 2091**].
Gout: In the ICU developed metatarsal erythema and pain.
H/o bladder cancer followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]  #.
H/o colon cancer with mets to liver followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]: S/p surgical hepatic resection and then cyberknife therapy for serial hepatic mets from likely colonic primary.
Possible new mets to lung as described above.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1186**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSES: - Pneumonia - Acute on chronic systolic heart failure, EF 30-35% - Enterococcal bacteremia associated with PICC - Lower gastrointestinal bleed - Anemia from chronic bleeding and kidney disease - Acute renal failure on stage 3 chronic kidney disease - Urinary retention - Benign prostatic hyperplasia - Lung nodules - Gout  SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: - Coronary artery disease - History of bladder cancer - History of metastatic colon cancer - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Shortness of breath: Likely from resolving pneumonia and fluid overload from your heart failure.
Chronic heart failure: Your "dry" weight is approximately 155 pounds.
If there is a [**2-20**] pound increase from your baseline weight, you should see a medical doctor to have your medication regimen adjusted.
Eat low salt foods and restrict fluids to 1500cc.
Chest CT scan showed a new nodule in your lungs.
Given the recent infections, it is unclear if this is related to infection or may represent a metastasis from one of your cancers.
Enterococcal bacteremia: You had a transient blood infection that was likely a complication from an IV.
You will have been fully treated for this infection with 14-days of antibiotics.
