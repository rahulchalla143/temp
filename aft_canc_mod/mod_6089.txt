He was taken to an OSH and given  3 mg Ativan, 1 g Dilantin, 10 mg Decadron (for known meningioma with edema).
However, he had a 3 day binge on [**1-/2129**] leading to a fall and probably fractured ribs and another smaller drinking 1 week before the last admission.
Gen: Lying in bed, NAD HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa Neck:  supple CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: diffusely roncherous aBd: +BS soft, nontender ext: no c/c/e, equal radial and pedal pulses B/L.
No BTT b/L.
Toes downgoing bilaterally    Pertinent Results: 7/ 17/ 09: CT CNS w/o contrast: Right anterior fossa mass likely representing calcified meningioma, although cannot rule out possibility of metastasis.
We would recommend an MR with contrast to further characterize the lesion   EEG: 7/ 17/ 09: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to slow and  disorganized background.
These findings suggest a widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing although encephalopathies can obscure focal findings.
There were no epileptiform features seen during this tracing.
Regarding the etiology of his new GTC episodes, a CNS bleed or worsening mass effect of his meningioma was ruled out.
Given his recurrent episodes of prolonged seizures, he is at high risk of relapse, and requires careful medical monitoring.
