History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 39760**] is a 76 y/o F with history of autoimmune hepatitis, diastolic CHF, hypertension, T2DM, as well as abdominal B cell lymphoma, diagnosed after recent onset of abdominal pain.
She initially presented to NEBH ambulatory care [**2114-12-5**] for mild abdominal pain, where, abdominal exam reportedly was notable for a palpable mass.
She underwent abdominal/pelvis CT scan, which revealed a large soft tissue density surrounding the cecum and ascending colon with significant stranding, initially believed to be a phlegmon possibly [**1-23**] appendicitis or appendiceal rupture.
There was moderate concentric narrowing but no obstruction.
CT also showed a smaller, similar phlegmon anterior to the transverse colon.
CT Chest was negative for malignancy.
She was admitted for surgical evaluation and biopsy, and triaged to the ICU for intensive fluid management in the setting of her severe diastolic CHF.
She underwent abdominal open surgery on [**12-10**], with biopsy of her mass in multiple abdominal locations - diagnosis felt to be large B cell lymphoma.
As above, CT chest was negative for malignant involvement.
In regards to her hypercalcemia, she was treated with normal saline and furosemide, with normalization of her serum calcium levels.
On day of transfer, her calcium was 9.8 with albumin of 2.2, suggesting mild hypercalcemia.
She underwent TTE on [**12-13**] that was reportedly not consistent with dCHF.
NEBH d/c summary reports today's exam notable for no fevers, mild hypotension with systolic BPs in the 90s, regular heart rhythm with rate in the 80s, and normal oxygen saturation.
She was reported as having a distended, slightly tender abdomen.
D/c summary also indicated that today's CXR was unchanged, showing poor inspiratory effort, prominent hila, basilar atelectasis bilaterally but no significant change from prior chest x-rays.
Discharge summary also reports a supraventricular tachycardia 5 days ago treated with po lopressor and diltiazem.
At time of [**Hospital1 18**] admission patient's on compliant is dysuria and vaginal pain.
Otherwise denies shortness of breath, chest pain or abdoiminal pain.
-Hypertension treated with metoprolol and Lasix -osteoarthritis -sleep apnea -diabetes mellitus insulin-dependent, treated with Novolin and regular insulin -COPD -possible pulmonary hypertension (This was not borne out by a recent echocardiogram which although technically difficult, did not show evidence, doppler or otherwise of diastolic dysfunction) -hiatal hernia treated with Nexium -multiple allergies with intermittent use of Zyrtec -hyperuricemia treated with urolic -possible history of CHF, which has been treated with Lasix -headaches treated with Fioricet.
Past Surgical History: -oophorectomy and appendectomy in [**2063**] -hysterectomy [**2085**] -cholecystectomy [**2099**] -bowel resection in [**2099**] as well  Social History: A 35-pack-year, quit in [**2087**] and no alcohol.
Physical Exam: Upon admission: GEN: NAD, patient complains in pain HEENT: PERRLA, EOMI, anicteric, MMM, op without lesions, no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, no jvd RESP: CTA b/l with good air movement throughout CV: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly EXT: no c/c/e SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice/no splinters NEURO: AAOx3.
At discharge: VS: Tmax 97.7 / BP 87-131/58-82 / HR 79-90 / RR 20-24 / Sats 92-96% on 2L Blood sugars: 165-218 Gen: NAD, more comfortable today Skin: diffusely swollen, most on bilateral lower extremities and some on R hand, skin on stomach is friable around abdominal wound.
abdominal wound has steri-strips over most of incision but one area at apex and one at base of incision are opened and packed with gauze.
Area around wound is not indurated and there is no significant surrounding erythema Cardiac: RRR, S1, S2, no m/r/g, JVP not elevated Pulm: CTAB in anterior and lateral fields, fair air movement Abdomen: soft, NT, distended [**1-23**] to body habitus, positive bowel sounds Extremities: 3+ pitting edema up to mid-thigh bilaterally with 2+ pulses at BP and radial arteries Neuro: A&Ox3, CN II-XII intact, language normal  Pertinent Results: Upon admission: [**2114-12-19**] 03:25AM BLOOD WBC-6.8 RBC-3.17* Hgb-10.4* Hct-32.2* MCV-102*# MCH-32.9* MCHC-32.3 RDW-22.1* Plt Ct-271 [**2114-12-19**] 03:25AM BLOOD PT-13.5* PTT-21.1* INR(PT)-1.2* [**2114-12-19**] 03:25AM BLOOD Glucose-139* UreaN-45* Creat-1.2* Na-139 K-5.2* Cl-98 HCO3-30 AnGap-16 [**2114-12-19**] 11:49AM BLOOD ALT-72* AST-91* AlkPhos-65 TotBili-0.7 [**2114-12-19**] 03:25AM BLOOD LD(LDH)-720* [**2114-12-19**] 11:49AM BLOOD Albumin-3.0* Calcium-10.7* Phos-5.2* UricAcd-6.1*  Imaging/pathology: Bone Marrow Immunotyping ([**2115-12-18**]): RESULTS: Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to optimize lymphocyte yield.
CD45 bright, low side scatter lymphoid events are less than 2% of total analyzed events.
B cells comprise 5% of lymphoid-gated events, and do not express aberrant antigens.
Clonality is difficult to assess due to scant numbers, but appears polyclonal.
INTERPRETATION Non-specific T cell dominant profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by non-Hodgkin lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
Chromosome analysis bone marrow ([**2115-12-18**]): KARYOTYPE: 46,XX[20] INTERPRETATION:  No clonal cytogenetic aberrations were identified in metaphases analyzed from this unstimulated specimen.
This normal result does not exclude a neoplastic proliferation.
Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the standard methods employed.
Note: FISH studies were not performed because assessment of the specimen by Pathology showed no evidence of lymphoma.
ECHO ([**2115-12-19**]): Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Extensive wall thickening centered in the ileocecal region but also involving the ascending and proximal transverse colon.
Appearances may be due to lymphoma, typhilitis or colitis.
No fluid collections seen.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Periportal edema noted.
Multiple small low-attenuation lesions noted in both kidneys.
Diffuse anasarca.
Extensive calcification of the abdominal aorta.
Final Addendum CT images from [**Hospital6 2910**] dated [**2114-12-8**] have now become available for comparison.
A large soft tissue mass in the right lower quadrant involving the ascending colon and terminal ileum is significantly decreased in size.
The previously noted eccentric wall thickening in the transverse colon has significantly improved.
Mild residual pulmonary venous congestion, but improved perihilar infiltrates likely reflect improved pulmonary edema.
Basal atelectasis with possible small area of superimposed consolidation at left base.
Small basal pleural effusions.

#B cell lymphoma: Diagnosed with pathology, cytology, and flow consistent with a B cell lymphoma.
Tumor lysis labs were followed q8hours without issue, and bicarb D5W 75 cc/hr was also given with allopurinol.
Echo revealed mild diastolic CHF.
Pt was kept NPO during the first 11 days of chemo over concerns that as her bowel mass shrunk she was at risk for perforation of the bowel.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Pt had reported episode of Afib with RVR at NEBH before transfer.
# Delerium: Pt had reported episode of delerium while at NEBH but was not delerious at time of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
No issues with initiation of chemotherapy but pt complained of intermittent back pain from old known compression fracture and was given one dose of IV dilaudid as at time had elevated LFTs and questionable renal function.
Pt became very delerious from dilaudid.
# COPD: Pt with history of underlying lung disease of uncertain severity.
Unclear how much of this due to lung disease and how much to other issues.
# Febrile Neutropenia: During pts count nadir from above CHOP, pt developed fevers.
Due to concern for abdominal source, started initially on Cefepime and Metronidazole and then broadened to Vancomycin when fevers persisted.
Abx were stopped after counts recovered so that pt no longer neutropenic.
# Diabetes Type II: Pt with history of DM II and on insulin at home.
With initiation of chemo and accompanying steroids, pt had blood sugars very difficult to control into 300s routinely with just ISS coveage.
At time of D/C wound not infected but still opened and packed at both superior and inferior portion of wound.
# GERD: Pt with no history of hiatal hernia and accompanying bad GERD which caused significant intermittent abdominal discomfort.
