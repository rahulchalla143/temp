Of note, pt was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**12-16**] thorugh [**12-21**] on the OMed service for neutropenic fever due to Klebsiela bacteremia sensitive to cefepime (it was resistant to levofloxacin and gentamycin).
Pt also developed a cough over the course of the night.
He was noted to have significant bilateral LE edema and edema of the back.
CXR was significant for a new LLL infiltrate suggestive for a PNA.
A cardiology consult was obtained and they felt the pt's elevated troponins were secondary to demand ischemia from ongoing sepsis.

Brief Hospital Course:     80 y/o M with PMH significant for presumed lung CA metastatic to colon, COPD, and CAD admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**12-22**] with fever and SOB.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], multiple etiologies were considered for the pt's symptoms but it was felt that he was most likely septic.
His cefepime was changed to meropenem and vancomycin since he had a recent history of ESBL pseudomonas in his sputum.
His sepsis was most likely due to PNA but blood, urine, and sputum cultures wewre all negative.
On [**12-24**], pt was started on PO diltiazem for rate control in the setting of atrial flutter.
However, on [**12-28**] he became hypoxic due to a mucus plug and subsequent LUL collapse.
He was hypotensive requiring dopamine for a short time.
Hydralazine was added for BP control.
Lovenox was stopped due to dropping Hct and hematuriaa nd elevated factor 10A levels.
On [**2185-1-1**], pt had respiratory distress with desats in 70's on exertion.
Patient requires intermittent BiPAP, as recently as the evening of [**2185-1-3**] for ongoing respiratory distress.
[**Name (NI) 15305**] Pt's presentation on admission was most consistent with sepsis in the setting of PNA and immune reconstution (he initially was admitted in [**Month (only) 404**] for Klebesilla PNA/sepsis in the setting of neutropenia).
He finished an emperic 10 day course of meropenem and vancomycin for presumed aspiration pneumonia and additionally a ten day course of levaquin for double coverage.
Hypoxia/COPD- He had significant hypoxia on admission.
His hypoxia is most likely multifactorial in origin: PNA, severe COPD, and lung CA.
The diagnosis of PE was entertained, but a workup for PE could not be easily undertaken as a VQ scan would not be helpful in the setting of the pt's baseline lung disease and a CTA was avoided given a recent episode of ARF.
He developed acute hypoxia during his hospital stay, and was transferred to the intensive care unit.
On the AM of transfer, pt was tachypneic into 30s but was sleeping comfortably.
Chest xray revealed LUL collapse, and on bronchoscopy likely due to mucous plugging.
Rapidity of developement of L-sided lung collapse and white-out suggested mucous plugging as etiology of hypoxia.
Repeat bronch showed secretions in LLL.
He was intubated breifly then extubated successfully and maintained on coolneb facemask with an oxygen requirement which was slowly weaned to 4L.
He finished his ten day course of meropenem and vancomycin for a presumed pneumonia, and was to finish a ten day course of levaquin started later for double coverage of a presumed pneumonia.
His new poor baseline is thought to be due to his end stage COPD and lung cancer.
The paitent has been getting IV morphine and ativan prn for tachypnea and anxiety which helps him greatly.
Lung cancer: He had chemotherpy last in the beginning of [**Month (only) 404**].
There are no other options currently for chemo or radiation according to his [**Month (only) 5564**].
Chronic iron def anemia: His iron studies in [**11-1**] c/w iron deficiency anemia.
His stool is guiac positive with a stable hct.
6. h/o DVT in [**2183**] - [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] team started holding lovenox on [**12-31**] due to decreasing HCT.
No DVT seen on f/u LENIs [**12-23**].
He was on lovenox 150mg sc daily on discharge from last hospitalization for DVT in [**10-2**]  His lovenox was restarted [**2185-1-1**] as Hct stable at very low dose 50 mg SC daily.
Atrial flutter - He was started on diltiazem for rate control - no intervention indicated at this time, unless patient goes into CHF from rapid atrial flutter.
8. hematuria - He had a breif episode of hematuria possibly [**12-30**] to supratherapeutic lovenox.
+ RBCs (not myoglobinuria), urine sediment w/o acanthocytes, casts.
H/o CAD - He had a troponin leak on admission, thought to be in setting of hypotension per cardiology consult.
This should be increased to treat his depression as needed.
However, in his acute respiratory distress with the mucus plug, he decided to be intubated.
It was explained multiple times that he has a very dismal prognosis and given his end stage COPD, that he has a very high liklihood of being vent dependant if he is intuabted again.
He inderstands that he has a terminal diagnosis, but would want to be intubated for a short time again if needed.
He denies any pain including CP and abdominal pain.
Prednisone 60 mg daily- Part of a prednisone taper.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed: Hold for sedation or RR <12.
