She initially presented to her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**6-7**] with several days of cough and progressive shortness of breath, and 25 pound weight loss over past several months.
Chest x-ray and CT chest were performed which revealed diffuse, extensive lung disease as outlined above.
She was scheduled for outpatient bronchoscopy, but prior to appointment on [**6-11**] developed severe dyspnea and was brought to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] emergency room.
Bronchoscopy was also performed, showing extrinsic compression of RML and possible submucosal disease.
No e/o endobronchial lesion or obstruction.
Probably external compression of lingular bronchus.
Lavage, brushings, and EBUS-guided biopsies were performed.
It was felt that her fairly precipitous decline was [**2-5**] occlusion of R MSB with subsequent collapse/atalectasis.
Based on admission CXR which showed new density (infiltrate vs. effusion) at right lung base, she was started on Zosyn for pneumonia despite no clinical s/s of pneumonia.
Past Medical History: -Extensive lung masses per above, likely poorly differentiated bronchogenic adenocarcinoma -Osteopenia -Anxiety -Panic disorder -Lyme meningioencephalitis c/b seizures -C. diff ([**2152**])   Social History: She is married with two daughters and five grandchildren.
Family History: noncontributory  Physical Exam: On admission: Vitals: 99.3 106 120/46 23 78% 3L + 10L face tent General: thin F in mild respiratory distress, coughing, AAOx3, talking in full sentences HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: sinus tachycardia, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops  Lungs: diffusely decreased breath sounds, moreso in BL posterior middle and lower lung fields.
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: CN II-XII grossly intact   Pertinent Results: On admission: .
No pulmonary embolism.
Short interval progression of metastatic central lymphadenopathy, producing more bronchial obstruction and middle lobe and left upper lobe atelectasis/obstructive pneumonia.
New left lower lobe pneumonia and increasing moderate right pleural effusion since [**2156-6-8**].
Numerous lung metastases.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 70 yo F with significant smoking history transferred from OSH for workup and treatment of extensive lung masses with compression of RML bronchus and lingular bronchus and post-obstructive collapse.
Active Issues: # LUNG MASSES, BRONCHIAL COMPRESSION: Patient with extensive burden of cancer on chest CT scan.
Pathology at OSH had shown poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma - likely of lung origin.
Medical oncology and Radiation oncology were consulted and explained to the family that given her burden of disease and performance status, palliative treatment would offer little benefit.
# ANXIETY, PANIC DISORDER: Pt with history of anxiety and had significant anxiety during hospitalization, which was contributing to her dyspnea.
