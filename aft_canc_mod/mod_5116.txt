Interval increase of left pelvic mass with close association with the bowel.
Enterovaginal fistula.

Gallbladder sludge without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Hepatic hypodensity, concerning for metastasis.

Brief Hospital Course: 43 yo femaled with advanced ovarian cancer, was admitted with complaints of fever, chills, and was found to have SIRS/septic shock, and was initially managed in the ICU.
She was found to be bacteremic with strep anginosus, which is likely d/t intrabdominal fisulization/abscesses.
A CT of her abdomen and pelvis (without contrast due to allergy) showed significantly worsening ovarian cancer, colovaginal fistulization, and possible microperforation vs infection at her [**Doctor Last Name 3379**] pouch.
Her blood cultures later revealed strep anginosus (milleri), and her antibiotics were changed to oral flagyl and levofloxacin, as she prefered an oral regimen for palliation.
At the time of discharge, she was still having low-grade temps, but seh was not symptomatic from them.
* Colovaginal fistula - She has a known colovaginal fistula, however there are no surgical options per GynOnc discussion.
