Here, a CXR demonstrated a large left pleural effusion, nearly effacing the entire lung.
He had a CT that also demonstrated a large effusion with contralateral mediastinal shift; it was read as concerning for fungal infection.
Extensive, refractory disease that has progressed despite multiple treatments.
Hypercholesterolemia .

A/P: 68 y/o male with refractory multiple myeloma presents with respiratory failure and a large left pleural effusion.
#Respiratory failure -- unclear why sudden onset, concerning for PE, however, would not get CTA given myeloma kidney and large left effusion which explains resp failure - Most likely multifactorial.
Pleural effusion + bacterial pneumonia + fungal pneumonia +/- pulmonary plasmacytoma +/- PE - Pleural effusion was tapped and appears to be malignant--- has many plasma cells in the fluid.
- sputum from [**10-25**] grew Aspergillus [**Country 11730**] - sputum from [**10-26**] GPR and GPC - Chest tube to drain effusion initially given size [**10-25**].
#Tachycardia -- will check ecg but suspect secondary to infection #Hypotension -- Pt's bp dropped to 80's while in the ED, did not respond to fluids and required transient norepi, now off pressors and with bp's in high 90's, low 100's.
The dip in bp seems to have been related to intubation/sedating meds.
A UA in the ED did not show evidence of an intrinsic process.
Likely due to infectious process.
#Anemia/thrombocytopenia -- Pt is at his baseline hct and plt, and these levels are likely due to his overwhelming myeloma burden.
MICRO: sputum [**10-25**]: aspergillus [**Country 11730**] sputum [**10-26**]: GPC and GPR  Past Medical History: Multiple Myeloma with multiple plasmacytomas Hypercholesterolemia s/p appendectomy Hepatitis B  Social History: The pt.
Interval development of nodular opacities within the right upper and lower lobes of the lung, as well as within the collapsed left lung and left hemithorax.
These are likely due to multiple sites of tumor deposits, less likely an infectious etiology such as a fungal infection.
Small right pleural effusion with associated right lower lobe compressive atelectasis.
Interval development of multiple subcutaneous soft tissue density nodules within the chest wall as well as one lateral to right kidney, which may be secondary to myeloma or less likely, lymphoma.
Osseous findings compatible with multiple myeloma.
LLE Dopplers [**10-25**]: no clot   Brief Hospital Course: This was a 68 year old male with refractory multiple myeloma who presented with respiratory failure and a large left pleural effusion.
On Chest CT the patient had left lung collapse with effusion and likely plasmacytoma (white-out on CXR).
Neurologic exam revealed no corneal reflexes or pupillary reflexes.
Out of concern for CNS process, head CT was done and showed no acute changes.
The patient remained tachycardic while here.
This was attributed to infection and was treated with IV fluids and antibiotics.
His anemia and thrombocytopenia were at their baselines.
These were attributed to his overwhelming myeloma burden.
