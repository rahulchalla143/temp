She reports a dry cough that has been ongoing for the last week, but denies fever, chills, night sweats, SOB, productive sputum, and CP.
She also reports an fall yesterday on transfer from the bedside commode to her bed, landing head first.
On review of systems she also reports recent nausea and vomiting that improved with Zofran.
Her po intake has been limited and she reports occasional episodes of lightheadedness and dizziness.
ROS: no fevers or chills at home, + occasional hot flashes, no cold sx or cough, no CP, + fatigue and states that she has had to slow down over the past couple of weeks, no dysuria, no calf pain, no LE edema, no sensory or motor changes.
Past Medical History: no medical problems prior to dx of br ca .
ONCOLOGICAL HISTORY (PER OMR):  [**Known firstname **] was diagnosed with a right-sided breast cancer in [**2186-7-5**].
The initial biopsy results showed her tumor to be ER and PR negative and HER-2/neu overexpressing by report sent to us from Dr.[**Name (NI) 30616**] office.
She was treated with neoadjuvant FAC x1 followed by 4 cycles of dose-dense AC and four cycles of dose-dense Taxol.
At some point, shortly thereafter, it was determined that her tumor was indeed not overexpressing of HER-2/neu.
In [**2187-12-5**] metastases to the spine as well as some soft tissue lesions were noted.
A pathology report of these lesions confirmed a triple negative status.
There is a compression fracture or dislocation.
She has four half siblings, two maternal aunts had cancers, one who had breast cancer in her 70s and one with some type of cancer in her back, in her 60s.
A paternal aunt also had breast cancer in her 70s and a paternal aunt had some type of cancer.
Physical Exam: VS: as above comfortable at rest, with no apparent distress, speaking in full sentences neck supple, no jvd, no nodes rrr, nl s1+s2, no m/r/g Coarse breath sounds throughout, more decreased sounds on right upper quadrant, left with expiratory rhonchi abdomen soft, non tender, non extended, nl bs, no c/c/e a&ox3, cns [**3-17**] intact, nl strength and reflex in all four limbs, nl sensation.
Interval new pulmonary edema, with atypical infection felt less likely.
Perhaps increased loculated fluid associated with the dominant right upper lobe mass.
New right upper lobe consolidation, possibly post-obstructive in the setting of narrowing of the right apical segmental bronchus adjacent to lymphadenopathy.
Continued rapid progression of multifocal metastatic disease within the lymph nodes and pleura, as well as probable progressive lymphangitic carcinomatosis in the right lung.
Extensive hepatic disease likely due to widespread metastases, although infection is an additional consideration given the rapid development since [**2188-6-3**].
Extensive skeletal metastasis with compression deformity at the T10 vertebral body with further slight decrease in height since recent chest CT. 5.
Supraclavicular and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy   Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and plan: 43 yo female with metastatic breast cancer to pleural space and to spine presented with hypoxia.
Found to have findings on CT consistent with lymphangetic carcinomatosis of the right lung.
Patient with extensive disease including mets to pleural space, T4 and T10 spine, diffuse metastatic disease of pelvis, lumbar spine, proximal femurs and lesion of posterior aspect of right ischial tuberosity s/p xrt and chemotherapy.
Dyspnea and hypoxemia: Based on CT findings of RUL infiltrate she was thought to have post-obstructive pna vs. radiation pneumonitis vs. lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
On [**8-10**], she became tachypneic with respiratory rates in the 40's to 50's; this was also accompanied by tachycardia and intermittent desaturations to the 80's.
Some component of this episode was thought to be due to anxiety.
Breast cancer, metastatic:  As described above, her disease was extensive with diffuse metastatic disease and rapid progression.
See oncologic history for pre-admission details.
At this time she is wanting mainly comfort care; labs are still being drawn at this time in preparation for possible intrathecal pump insertion.
Pain control: Initially having a great deal of difficulty with pain control, and patient had nausea/vomiting and altered mental status thought in part to be due to systemic narcotics and other pain medications.
An epidural catheter was placed which improved pain control and mental status.
Placement of intrathecal pump is highly desired by the family and patient for longer term pain control.
Nausea: This improved with decrease in systemic narcotic doses and other medications (including Zofran, compazine, and lorazepam).
Depression and anxiety: We started her on Paxil and lorazepam with good effect.
Anemia: Likely due to myelosuppression from chemotherapy.
She is to be transferred to oncology service with anesthesia following.
