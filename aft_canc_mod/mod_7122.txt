New moderate-sized left-sided pleural effusion and small pericardial effusion which has also increased in size.
Interval increase in metastatic burden with enlargement of additional intra-abdominal mass anterior to the large left adrenal lesion.
Interval enlargement of right basilar pulmonary nodule.
[**2136-2-2**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Left-sided pleural effusion.
Left mid lung pulmonary nodular opacity, new since prior study, additional site of metastatic disease not excluded.
No evidence of acute consolidation.
Right base mass again seen.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**2136-2-4**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Interval increase in retrocardiac opacity which may reflect a combination of a layering effusion with compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
Rounded opacity at the right base is unchanged and is felt to correspond to the pleural-based mass seen on the recent CT study consistent with metastatic disease.
The previously reported lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum is not well appreciated on the plain film study.
No pneumothorax.
No pulmonary edema.
More focal nodularity in the left mid lung is again seen but less well visualized than on the prior study of [**2136-2-2**].
[**2137-2-6**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Relatively unchanged exam, though new focal nodularity projecting over the left mid lung may represent additional metastatic deposit.
[**2137-2-7**] ABD U/S: IMPRESSION: Cholelithiasis without evidence for cholecystitis.
No evidence for biliary obstruction.

She reported diffuse abdominal tenderness.
Non-contrast CT showed pericardial effusion, left pleural effusion, increased tumor burden, and stable left hydronephrosis.
Echo showed small pericardial effusion without tamponade.
For fever [**2136-2-4**], she was again given vanco/cipro, both were stopped the next day.
Carboplatin/paclitaxel were given [**2136-2-6**], complicated by abnormal LFTs.
# Abdominal pain: Likely due to progression of disease and large left adrenal mass compressing stomach.
# Abnormal LFTs: Rising alk phos, GGT, and AST.
U/S showed a gallstone, but no biliary obstruction or infection.
Discussed with ERCP; they were inclined to do an ERCP to rule out cholangitis, especially given recent fevers and abdominal pain.
# Encephalopathy: Acute delirium likely due to lorazepam.
# Metastatic ovarian CA: Carboplatin/paclitaxel last given 10/[**2132**].
Considered left adrenal mass aspiration, but radiology review decided it was not cystic.
She was given carboplatin AUC5 and paclitaxel 175mg/m2 [**2136-2-6**] for the rapid rate of progression with tumor tracking down left ureter causing mild/moderate hydronephrosis.
Cipro, metronidazole, and vancomycin stopped after 1st dose, then cipro/vanco restarted [**2136-2-5**] due to recurrent fever, but stopped again [**2136-2-6**].
Mild hypoxia [**2136-2-7**] resolved.
# Anemia: Acute on chronic.
# Elevated cardiac enzymes: Cardiac ischemia from demand during SVT at presentation.
# Hypothyroidism: Thyroid panel shows continued hypothyroidism.
# Depression: Psychiatry consulted.
# Pain (abdomen): Oxycodone and acetaminophen analgesia PRN.
# Acute renal failure: Improved after IV fluids, which were discontinued thereafter.
Urine Na 62 (high), but she appeared hypovolemic and was orthostatic.
# Metabolic acidosis: Non-anion-gap.
Repleted hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia.
# DVT PPx: SC heparin.
# Precautions: None.
5. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for Insomnia.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Constipation.
15. lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for Constipation.
16. magnesium hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for Constipation.
Hypotension (low blood pressure).
Metastatic ovarian cancer.
Anemia (low red blood cell count).
Abnormal liver function tests.
Leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count).
Cardiac ischemia (heart muscle damage) due to the initial rapid heart rate.
Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).
Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain, severe hypotension (low blood pressure), supraventricular tachycardia (very fast heart rate), and altered mental status (confusion).
Cardiac enzymes were elevated suggesting strain on your heart when it was beating rapidly.
Intermittently, you had fevers and were given several doses of antibiotics, but a specific infection was never uncovered.
A CT scan showed marked progression of ovarian cancer, so you were restarted on chemotherapy.
Liver function tests became markedly abnormal.
An ultrasound of the liver and gallbladder showed no abnormalities other than gallstones, and did not show an infection or bile duct blockage.
If these continue to worsen or you develop fevers again, you will need to be readmitted to the hospital.
You were also given a blood transfusion for anemia (low red blood cell count).
Psychiatry was also following you here for depression and made changes to some of your medications.
Restart lisinopril initially held for low blood pressure.
