The patient is status post esophagectomy and gastric pull-through with prominent persistent right base opacity seen.
Since the prior study, there has been overall diffuse increase in interstitial markings most consistent with pulmonary edema.
There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle and a small left pleural effusion is likely present.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the anterior septum.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality due to body habitus.
Assessment of the aortic valve is challenging due to suboptimal image quality and irregular rhythm.
Degere of aortic stenosis is probable severe.
EGD [**2136-10-22**] Evidence of esophagectomy s/p gastric pullthrough.
Colonoscopy:  Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon 8 mm polyp in the mid-transverse colon at 60 cm.
Given admission with concern for gastrointestinal bleeding polypectomy was not performed.
Normal mucosa in the whole colon without any evidence of bleeding.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum  EGD [**10-23**] Evidence of esophagectomy s/p gastric pullthrough.
There was possible 5 cm segment of barrett's in distal esophagus.
Given concern for recent GI bleed biopsies are not performed.
A large amount of fluid and food was found in the intrathoracic stomach.
The liquid component is suctioned out but there is large amount of solid residue.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  EGD:  [**10-24**]  The duodenum was not reached due to the food contents in the stomach.
Discharge labs: [**2136-10-29**] 06:30AM BLOOD WBC-8.6 RBC-3.64* Hgb-9.0* Hct-30.4* MCV-83 MCH-24.7* MCHC-29.6* RDW-18.5* Plt Ct-491* [**2136-10-30**] 06:30AM BLOOD WBC-9.9 RBC-3.54* Hgb-9.1* Hct-29.6* MCV-84 MCH-25.6* MCHC-30.7* RDW-18.7* Plt Ct-602* [**2136-10-30**] 06:30AM BLOOD WBC-9.9 RBC-3.54* Hgb-9.1* Hct-29.6* MCV-84 MCH-25.6* MCHC-30.7* RDW-18.7* Plt Ct-602*  Brief Hospital Course: 61M with h/o severe AS, a flutter, esophageal cancer s/p esophagectomy p/w progressively worsening DOE x 1 week and dyspnea at rest x 1 day found to have severe anemia (H/H 6.2/20.9), transferred to the floor and subsequently had likely aspiration event leading to respiratory distress.
ACTIVE ISSUES  #Respiratory distress: Initially the patient's dyspnea on exertion seemed to be consistent with symptomatic anemia given HCT 20.9 from baseline 39.1.
Given h/o severe AS, elevated BNP and pulmonary edema on CXR were concerning for CHF and acute onset in the setting of increased emotional stress and raised concern for ACS, however troponins were negative x2.
TTE was obtained and showed mild regional LV systolic dysfunction w/hypokinesis of the anterior septum, severe aortic valve stenosis, and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The patient's oxygen requirement resolved.
However, while on the floor he had several endoscopic procedures, and following the endoscopy to place a capsule for eval of his GIB, he became acutely hypoxic and went into respiratory distress; CXR showed an extensive new process in his left lung, thought to be [**3-8**] aspiration event.
He remained intubated for two days as he had become tachycardic with weaning down to pressure support only and there was fear of flash pulmonary edema from discontinuation of ventilation in the setting of his severe AS.
Concern for slow GIB given guiaic positive stool and h/o esophageal CA, HD stable.
However, food was noted to be retained in stomach, and he had repeat EGD/colonoscopy on [**10-23**] under general anesthesia which showed Barrett's on the endoscopy and normal colonic mucosa.
He underwent placement of a capsule into the stomach on [**10-24**] as there was retained food in the stomach and it was unable to be placed into the duodenum.
Hematocrit remained in the high 20s during the last days of his hospitalization and patient had no more clear episodes of GI bleeding.
#A flutter with rapid rate:  Patient developed atrial flutter with rates as high as 130-140.
He opted NOT to start anticoagulation with coumadin despite his CHADS score and stroke risk given his recent GI bleeding for which clear source was not found.
He had a TTE which showed severe aortic stenosis again with valve area 0.8-1.0cm2.
Patient was not interested in having a cardiac catheterization during this hospitalization for the aortic stenosis, but may be amenable as an outpatient.
# Gastroparesis - patient started on reglan, but this seemed to exacerbate his atrial flutter (made it faster) so it was discontinued.
Patinet was able to eat in the hospital without nausea or vomiting.
# CAD:  Cardiology service felt that the new mild hypokinesis seen on his ECHO was secondary to ischemia, and they advised starting aspirin 81 mg a day.
I urged him to continue to take it, as it would also offer some small amount of protection against thromboembolic disease given his atrial flutter.
Fish Oil (Omega 3) 1000 mg PO DAILY   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Anemia- occult GI bleed Atrial flutter Severe aortic stenosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with anemia (low blood count).
You underwent multiple endoscopic procedures, which did not reveal a source of bleeding in your GI tract.
You suffered an aspiration event during one of the endoscopies, and needed to be placed on a mechanical ventilator in the ICU for two days.
