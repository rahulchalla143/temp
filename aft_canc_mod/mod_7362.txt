Today, the nephew picked up the patient for a routine visit with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3759**], his Oncologist where it was noted that the patient was having increased dyspnea on exertion and new bilateral ankle swelling.
At the visit, the patient was noted to be mildly hypoxic to the mid 90s and abnormal lung sounds.
A CXR was obtained which showed a new moderate right pleural effusion.
The patient was admitted for further workup of this new pleural effusion and bilateral ankle swelling.
Of note, did have mechanical fall in early [**Month (only) 359**] that caused a non-operative subdural hemorrhage and a left wrist fracture which is currently splinted.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Patient and his nephew report several years of low grade pancytopenia and progressive fatigue.
Patient also reports a recent weight loss but denies fevers, chills or night sweats.
Given the progression of symptoms and counts a bone marrow biopsy was performed which demonstrated a monoclonal B cell population consistent with a lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.
Patient started on Rituximab - Rituximab 4 weekly doses [**2119-7-7**]  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - HTN - HL - dementia, patient reports trouble with memory - BPH - anemia - BPH - GERD - Back pain - Peripheral neuropathy - Inguinal hernia - Ventral hernia - Venous stasis  PSgHx: - Cholecystectomy - Excision of scalp skin cancer  Social History: Single.

[**2120-1-29**] TTE: IMPRESSION: There is a circumferential pericardial effusion which is relatively small.
Reduced LVEF with inferolateral and probable septal hypokinesis.
Comparison to echo of [**2120-1-24**], the right ventricle appears smaller and there is probable tamponade physiology.
Wall motion abnormalities could not be compared as the current study was limited.
[**2120-1-30**] TTE: IMPRESSION: Moderate-sized pericardial effusion without evidense of tamponade physiology.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-29**], the patient is no longer tachycardic.
Short of a very brief diastolic RV "dip", there are now no clear signs of impaired ventricular fillling.
Moderate right pleural effusion is new.
Moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged.
Pulmonary edema has increased.
Heart size may be slightly increased which may represent slight increasing pericardial effusion.
No evidence of pneumonia.
New right moderate pleural effusion.
Left moderate pleural effusion is unchanged.
Heart size slightly bigger which may indicate a slight increase in pericardial effusion.
[**2120-1-26**] CT torso: CHEST: Unenhanced images of the chest demonstrate atherosclerotic calcifications within the normal-caliber aorta.
There is no intramural hematoma.
On contrast-enhanced images, there is no evidence of pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
The moderate pericardial effusion has minimally increased in size.
Left greater than right moderate pleural effusions have also increased in size.

There is also atherosclerotic calcification throughout the thoracic aorta.
ABDOMEN: There is periportal edema.
In addition, there are multiple peripheral hypodense regions (3B:95, 3B:108, 3B:112) which may relate to splenic infarctions.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is a hemangioma in L4 vertebral body.
Facet arthropathy is present in the lower lumbar spine.
There are no destructive osseous lesions.
Interval increase in size of moderate pericardial effusion, and left greater than right pleural effusions which measure simple fluid in Hounsfield units.

Pericardial effusion: He was noted to have a pericardial effusion on echo.
There was initially some concern for tamponade given that his BP had decreased from 150s systolic to the 100s.
A repeat TTE was obtained on HD6 ([**2120-1-29**]) which showed increased concern for tamponade physiology, however the effusion was too small for a pericardiocentesis.
A repeat TTE was obtained on HD7 which showed no tamponade physiology.
No pericardiocentesis performed as was too high risk.
Right pleural effusion: Unilateral pleural effusion on exam and CXR.
CXR otherwise clear, and he had no signs/symptoms of pneumonia (no fever, cough, leukocytosis).
ECG with no evidence of ischemia or right heart strain.
Fluid returned showing transudate, although flow cytometry of the fluid showed a minute population of lymphocytes c/w his known lymphoma.
It was unclear if this was simply contamination of the pleural fluid by traumatic tap vs. lymphoma is the primary etiology of the effusion.
HR improved with IV metoprolol and he was given PO metoprolol for rate control.
This was thought [**3-15**] overdiuresis with high right sided pressures and pericardial effusion.
He did not receive and electrical or chemical cardioversion.
The primary oncology team felt that although his CHADS score was 3 he was not a candidate for anticoagulation with warfarin given recent history of intracerebral hemorrhage and would not be a good candidate for aspirin given his low platelets in the setting of chemotherapy with likely continued chemotherapy in the near future.
Lower extremity edema: Bilateral and developed over last week PTA along with dyspnea on exertion.
It was felt that the right leg was slighly larger and more erythematous than the left, R LENI performed and was negative for DVT.
He did have elevated JVP concerning for CHF.
Albumin normal and UA showed no protein, suggesting that hepatic or renal source was less likely than cardiac etiology.
Echo showed pericardial effusion as well.
It was felt that pleural effusions were most likely due to lymphomatous spread vs cardiogenic source (impaired cardiac function in setting of pericardial effusion).
Resolved on discharge; pt with only trace lower extremity edema and no erythema present.
Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma: His disease appeared to be controlled after 4 cycles of rituxan in [**Month (only) 116**], but on admission there was concern that pleural and pericardial effusions could be related to underlying disease.
He was noted to have new splenomegaly, and mild leukopenia.
Out of concern for progression of disease (most likely pericardial/pleural effusions reflecting this, and evidence of lymphoma cells on pleural fluid analysis), rituxan was started [**2120-1-28**].
He was given solumedrol and he tolerated the rest of the effusion without problems.
[**Name (NI) **] was to continue with bendamustine, but pt became hypotensive and was transferred to the CCU out of concern for progressive pericardial effusion.
3 way foley was inserted and pt was continuously irrigated for >24 hours, eventually no clots were passing and foley was DCd.
Pt was urinating on his own without incontinence at the time of discharge.
Delirium: Pt became confused and aggitated most nights during hospitalization.
Home lisinopril was changed to captopril as captopril has shorter half-life and in the setting of tamponade physiology there was concern of inducing futher hypotension.

You came in with shortness of breath and lower leg swelling.
We found that you had some fluid in your lungs and around your heart.
Your heart experienced a lot of stress because it was surrounded by fluid and was not able to pump adequately.
Because of that, you developed an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.
You had a fever and chills as a reaction, but we were eventually able to finish the whole dose of medication without problems.
