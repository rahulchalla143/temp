58F with a history of metastatic RCC complicated by extensive mediastinal mets requiring placement of bronchial stent who was recently admitted for near syncope where she had a work up including  head CT, which was without changes, a CTA of the chest which was negative for PE and showed stable masses and an Echo which showed mild hypokinesis and an 40-45%.
She noted yesterday she had a low grade temp 100.4 that she states went up to 102 so she contact[**Name (NI) **] her oncologists Dr [**Name (NI) **] and Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] who told her to come to the hospital if it continued above 100.4.
She has also been experiencing a significant amount of throat pain from her esphagitis and was encouraged to use lidocaine/ benedryl for this.
She has also noted flu like symptoms over the past few days such as myalgias cough with yello sputum, body aches.
She had nausea and was give 8mg Zofran.
Her WCC was 1.4 and ANC 1275. lactate 1.1  Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: The patient was in USOH until winter of [**2181**] when she developed cold symptoms which did not clear with antibiotics.
Lung mediastinal mass was detected on CXR, which was followed by a CT scan, which confirmed a mass in the mediastinum.
Scanning also indicated a mass in the left kidney.
This was further evaluated  with imaging studies of the abdomen, which showed a large left renal mass measuring 15 x 11 cm.
Lytic lesion was also detected in the right acetabulum.
She was further evaluated with MRI which showed a left renal mass with no evidence of involvement of the left renal vein.
MRI scan showed a mass in the vertex of the skull measuring 5 cm in greatest dimension.
She underwent a bronchoscopy to evaluate the hemoptysis symptoms and biopsy the lung mass.
She underwent a biopsy of the left kidney mass, which showed renal cell carcinoma [**Last Name (un) 19076**] nuclear grade 1.
These slides have been reviewed and showed renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type, and nuclear grade 1.
Following these treatments, she was evaluated by the Biologics group and the Urology group for definitive treatment of renal cell carcinoma.
Recommendation was for dendritic cell vaccine therapy.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There is now a small pericardial effusion.
Distended gallbladder, with no definite CT evidence of cholecystitis.
Interval free fluid in the abdomen, mostly at the perihepatic and perisplenic distribution and tracking along the right paracolic gutter into the pelvis.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Questionable wall thickenning of the colon at the splenic flexture, could be due to collapsed colon; however this finding can be seen in colitis, if there is clinical concern.
Stable right acetabular lesion with pathologic fracture at the right inferior acetabulum, unchanged.
Multiple lesions within the spine consistent with metastatic disease, with possible hemangioma at L1.
Status post left nephrectomy with no definite evidence of recurrence at the surgical bed.
Interictal background activity was normal.
There were no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures.
Compared to recording from 24 hours prior, this study contains fewer electrographic seizures .
EEG [**9-13**] This is an abnormal portable EEG due to continuous generalized rhythmic spike and slow wave activity at a frequency of 2.5 Hz for the first half of this record consistent with non-convulsive status epilepticus.
Ativan with resolution of non-convulsive status and only brief short bursts of generalized spike slow wave discharges in the latter half of the study.
No focal lateralizing features were noted.
MR head: Compared to the previous MRI from [**2183-2-18**], the soft tissue component associated with the vertex frontal bone calvarial lesion has markedly decreased in size likely reflecting interval treatment.
Left frontal scalp lesion is unchanged compared to the most recent study.
There is no evidence for intracranial metastatic disease.
There is diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement, which may be related to prior radiation/LP or infectious/inflammatory sequela.
Appearance is not suggestive of dural mets.
There is a tiny 5- mm left frontal subdural focal thickening or collection which does not cause mass effect.
Patient has known mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy and right rib metastatic lesion.
There is no evident pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusion.
Assessment of the left pleural effusion is limited.
Destructive lesion in the lateral aspect of right mid rib is again noted.
Calcium Phos  Mg    8.7  3.4   2.2            Brief Hospital Course: 58 year old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma to skull, mediastinum, lungs, s/p Y stent placement presented with an episode of fever, nausea and worsening dysphagia/odynophagia.
# Fever/odynophagia/dysphagia- Initial differential diagnosis of this constellation of symptoms included esophagitis from radiation, thrush, or mucositis.
Fluconazole was given for oral/esophageal candidiasis.
# Renal cell carcinoma- Patient recently completed course of radiation therapy to skull and espophagus.
# Mental status- The patient had an episode of altered mental status on [**2183-9-7**] that was attribued to hyponatremia.
She required a brief course in the ICU, received IVF and hypertonic saline with improvment in both her mental status and hyponatremia (thought to be due to mild hypovolemia and SIADH).
The patient was hypotensive thought to be due to hypovolemia, which improved with IVF.
The patient did not have any other signs or symptoms of CHF, and was started on metoprolol and lisinopril.
An LP was performed, which showed a normal opening pressure, with no evidence of infection.
She was loaded with ativen and fosphenytoin with near-immediate improvement in her mental status.
She initially received phenytoin, but developed a leukopenia thought to be secondary to phenytoin.
# Bronchial stents- The patient underwent a flex bronchoscopy on [**2183-9-11**] which showed increasing tumor burden in the left main stem bronchus.
Post-bronchoscopy, the patient was noted to have decreased breath sounds on the left, and a chest film showed a white out of her left lung.
# PROPHY: mobilization (patient will need continued physical therapy, ppi, bowel regimen) Nutrition:  the patient was tolerating some PO intake at discharge, and was also receiving PPN.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 1121**] - [**Location (un) 1456**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: renal cell cancer with mediastinal/bronchial metastases  Secondary Diagnoses: systolic CHF sciatica Chronic sinusitis benign breast cyst C-section seasonal allergies   Discharge Condition: stable and improved   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with difficulty swallowing and fever.
You finished radiation to your esophagus, and your discomfort was thought to be due to a possible infection in your esophagus or from the radiation itself.
You then developed some confusion, which was thought to be due to a low sodium level.
However, you developed increased confusion and an inability to speak, which was due to a seizure.
This improved dramatically after you received treatment for your seizure.
You will need to continue taking a medication to prevent future seizures.
You also had an ultrasound of your heart which showed decreased function (EF of 20%), but luckily you did not have symptoms from this.
Please call your doctor or return to the ER if you have increasing pain, confusion, fevers/chills, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain or other concerns.
