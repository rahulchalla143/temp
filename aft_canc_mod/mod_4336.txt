Mr. [**Known firstname 21976**] states he had been in good health until approximately 10 days ago when he noted weakness in his right arm.

He also noticed he was more likely to fall after having a drink in the evening.
He has a feeling of numbness over the right deltoid and his right face.
He has chronic decreased appetite and notes slight weight loss over the past year.
He denies fevers, chills, nightsweats, cough, abdominal pain, changes in bowels/urinary habits, hematachezia or or any other systemic symptom.
No intervention.

FINDINGS:  There is bilateral upper lobe increased lucency with still visible pulmonary vasculature and no evidence of pneumothorax.
These findings are consistent with severe bilateral upper lobe emphysematous or bullous changes.
Right middle lobe plate-like atelectasis and mass-like parenchymal distortion in the left lingula might represent scarring or mass.
There is no pleural pathology.
There are no bony or soft tissue abnormalities.
Severe bilateral upper lobe emphysematous/bullous changes.
Left lingula mass-like parenchymal distortion might represent scaring or neoplasm.
Final Report INDICATION: 62-year-old man with new head mass.
FINDINGS: There is bilateral upper lobe increased lucency with visible pulmonary vasculature and no evidence of pneumothorax.
These findings are consistent with severe bilateral upper lobe emphysematous/bullous changes.
Right middle lobe plate-like atelectasis.
Large area of parenchymal distortion in the lingular lung might represent scarring, although underlying mass can not be excluded and is of concern.
Severe bilateral upper lobe emphysematous/bullous changes.
Chest CT recommended for further evaluation.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    Please assess for malignancy, staging.
HISTORY: 52-year-old male with brain mass, likely a metastasis, assess for malignancy.
TECHNIQUE: Initial unenhanced transaxial images through the abdomen were obtained.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There are diffuse centrilobular emphysematous changes throughout the lungs, with large bullae completely replacing the bilateral apices.
There are no associated enlarged hilar, mediastinal or axillary lymph nodes.
A non- enlarged 5-mm left hilar lymph node is noted.
No other lung lesions are identified.
Mild dependent atelectasis.
No pleural effusions.
CT ABDOMEN: The liver demonstrates homogeneous post-contrast enhancement without abnormal mass identified.
There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Numerous low-attenuating lesions are noted throughout the parenchyma bilaterally, some of which are too small to characterize.
The visualized bowel is grossly unremarkable in appearance without bowel wall thickening, inflammatory changes, or obstruction.
The abdominal aorta is slightly ectatic in course without aneurysmal dilatation.
Scattered calcified plaque noted at the infrarenal aorta.
No enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes are identified.
Prostate gland calcifications are noted.
No free fluid within the pelvis.
No enlarged pelvic lymph nodes are identified.
There are no osseous destructive lesions.
Additionally, a large left adrenal metastasis is noted measuring 3.1 x 2.6 cm in size.
Enlarged mesenteric lymph node with central necrosis aslo concerning for metastasis 2.
Diffuse centrilobular emphysematous changes throughout the lungs with large biapical bulla.
CT [**2129-4-2**] IMPRESSION:  Expected postsurgical appearance status post resection of the left frontal lobe mass.
3-cm intra-axial mass at the left frontovertex with small "satellite lesion," anteriorly.
There is marked associated vasogenic edema with local mass effect and stable 5 mm rightward shift of the normally-midline structures.
The lesion is superficially located and demonstrates more marked rim and central enhancement and is markedly hypercellular, accounting for its uniformly hyperdense appearance on the non-enhanced component of the CT and corresponding restricted diffusion.
No evidence of associated hemorrhage.
COMMENT: While certain feature, such as the central necrosis and "satellite nodule" are associated with primary glial neoplasms, the hypercellularity and restricted diffusion are quite atypical, with the overall constellation suggestive of either hypercellular metastasis, as seen with small cell bronchogenic carcinoma or, less likely, primary CNS lymphoma.
Interval resection of the left frontal mass with a nodular focus of enhancement along the superior margin of the surgical cavity which is concerning for residual tumor.
There is similar local mass effect with persistent vasogenic edema.
Multiple additional nodules throughout the brain suggest that these likely represent metastatic lesions and should be correlated with pathologic findings.
Findings concerning for pathologically enlarged left level 2 lymph node as detailed above, which is particularly concerning in this clinical context and dedicated imaging of the neck is recommended in further evaluation.
There is an ovoid 20 x 12 mm soft tissue density within the left neck (101:64) which is concerning for an enlarged left level 2 lymph node.
Pathologically enlarged left Level IIB and IIA lymph nodes, with abnormal appearance of rim-enhancement and central relative non-enhancement, similar to recent MR, concerning for metastatic disease, in the appropriate clinical setting.
Several small cervical nodes, elsewhere.
Severe biapical bullous emphysema.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 52y/o M presented to OSH with 10 day history of weakness in R arm.
He first thought it was d/t the icy-hot that he was using on the shoulder, but when he took the patch off, he realized that the weakness persisted.
He then began to notice weakness in his RLE with difficulty ambulating.
Once at the OSH, a head CT was performed and showed a 3cm L frontal mass.
He is to have a CT torso to r/o metastasis and MRI wand study for OR planning.
On [**4-3**], CT torso revealed a large hypoenhancing lingular mass, which appears to be invading into the pericardium as well as a large L ardenal mass.
Hematology Oncology continued to follow the patient and determined that oncology treatment would not be initiated until after completion of his whole brain radiation.
He has been ambulating short distances and strength in RUE and proximal RLE is 4-/5.
