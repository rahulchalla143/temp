Admission Date:  [**2114-12-23**]       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2076-5-17**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Miss [**Known lastname 17811**] is a 38-year-old female who originally had a lesion in the mid-sigmoid region, which had been diagnosed as a diverticulitis.
A CT scan performed at this hospital prior to surgery revealed no evidence of any liver metastasis and a barium enema still showed an obstructing lesion in the sigmoid.
The gastrografin through the cecostomy showed multiple large amounts of stool collection without obvious lesions.
It was felt that a subtotal colectomy of this obstructing lesion would be appropriate, since it was difficult to prep the bowel.
Hearing impairment.
General:  Alert and oriented in no acute distress.
There were no complications.
An attempt was made to extubate the patient, however, there was no cuff leak and she did not tolerate it, requiring re-intubation.
Otolaryngology was consulted and a CT scan of the neck was done showing single enlarged left paratracheal lymph node, numerous small lymph nodes throughout mediastinum and neck, left lower lobe collapse and left pleural effusion as well as incidental node of right aortic arch with possible apparent left subclavian artery.
The ENT service also did a fiberscopic study, showing abnormal abduction of the vocal cords and also a narrowing.
She spiked a fever to 103.7 with blood cultures positive for staph aureus as well as the central line tip.
Unfortunately she failed a second extubation attempt and there still was no cuff leak.
She received an antibiotic course for a pneumonia diagnosed on scan.
She had a clot in the left internal jugular vein.
A repeat ultrasound of the internal jugular vein showed partial resolution of the clot in the left internal jugular.
She was having diarrhea but C. difficile stool test remained negative.
Respiratory failure and vocal cord abnormality,     Status post tracheostomy.
Left internal jugular thrombosis.
