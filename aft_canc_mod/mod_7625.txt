She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] shortly after presentation and her course was notable for septic shock requiring pressors and removal of her PICC line; culture data demonstrated likely corynbacterium.
She remained hemodynamically stable though continuing to spike fevers until 102F until [**2140-9-19**], when she had an episode of hyotension to the 60s in the setting of rapid cooling while febrile.
She again became hypotensive to the 70s overnight in the setting of fever, but SBP did not improve with 250cc x 2 + 500cc x 1 bolus.
Her course on the floor was notable for worsening mental status, c. diff + stool, and a gradually increasing O2 requirement, from room air/3L intermittently on [**9-16**] to 5L nasal cannula on the day of transfer.
[**2139-1-22**], started hydroxyurea for increasing WBC count.

Patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with septic shock causing altered mental status, hypotension in the setting of a blast crisis from her AML.
She was neutropenic and her course was complictated by acute kidney injury, anemia requiring blood transfusions, hypovolemic hyponatremia, and diabetes   She was initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, including intravenous Vancomycin, Cefepime, Flagyl and Oral vancomycin.
She was eventually found to have C. difficile and so cefepime and intravenous vancomycin were discontinued.
However, she became hypotensive and began to develop respiratory distress and hypoxia.
Her goals of care were discussed with her sons and they felt that she would wish to pursue comfort care at this point given the state of her underlying AML and the severity of her sepsis.
