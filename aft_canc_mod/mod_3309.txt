Daily cough, which does not seem associated with hemoptysis.
He was seen by ENT in the ED, who performed fiberoptic exam through trach and did not see any active bleeding or friable tissue.
CTA of neck was performed to rule out invasion of carotid sheath.
Of note, he was seen in the ED on [**2107-8-30**] for similar hemoptysis, at which point the bleeding was thought to be coming from his tumor and pt was discharged home.
Past Medical History: Diabetes Hypertension Coronary Artery Disease, s/p CABG x 5 Permanent Pacemaker for sick sinus Peripheral Vascular Disease (AAA s/p repair) COPD Spontaneous Pneumothorax s/p chest tube Colon Cancer s/p resection and chemo (pt does not know details of therapy) in approximately [**2102**]   Social History: Patient is single.
Family History: Aunt with breast cancer and uncle with throat cancer.
There is evidence of underlying hyperinflation and probable edema.
There is persistent moderately large, posteriorly-layering right pleural effusion with associated basilar atelectasis.
There is a small left pleural effusion with left basilar atelectasis, as before.
The remainder of the lungs is grossly clear; specifically, there is no new focal airspace process to specifically suggest pulmonary hemorrhage.
IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of CHF with bilateral pleural effusions, superimposed on underlying emphysema.
However, there is no distinct new airspace process to suggest pulmonary hemorrhage.
The appearance of the cervicothoracic trachea and tracheostomy site are grossly unchanged since the [**2107-8-30**] examination.
There is redemonstration of an ill-defined, heterogeneous mass that is filling the left piriform sinus, with obliteration of the airway.
There is no evidence of active extravasation of contrast.
There is a right pulmonary parenchymal consolidation that is partially imaged.
Large right and mild/moderate left pleural effusion, slightly smaller compared to the previous exam.
No lesion seen in the trachea and lobar bronchi.
Extensive vascular disease.
Please refer to the report from the CTA Neck from one day prior for description of the known laryngeal mass.
Brief Hospital Course: 71M with head and neck cancer undergoing chemo and XRT with worsened hemoptysis # hemoptysis--likely related to necrosis of either primary mass induced by XRT.
- bronchoscopic exam of lower airways limited by mass, but no active bleeding seen - Hct down to 24.9, transfused one unit PRBCs [**9-14**] - bleeding likely to continue until large enough total dose of radiation has been delivered to substantially debulk the mass .
Oncology fellow saw patient and explained to him that his performance status and bleeding prevents him from safely receiving more chemo.
- morphine and tylenol prn for pain .
# HTN--poorly controlled on admission, increased lisinopril.
# COPD--nebs .
# CAD--h/o CABG but no active issues.
# FEN--TF through PEG.
# Ppx--heparin sub-q, ppi .
