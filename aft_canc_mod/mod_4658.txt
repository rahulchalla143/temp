Again seen is evidence of post-surgical changes, consistent with posterior decompression and fusion, apparently unchanged since the prior examination and causing multiple metal artifacts, however, there is no evidence of abnormal signal within the thoracic spinal cord at T2 level.
The sagittal STIR images demonstrate low signal intensity within the vertebral body of T2, consistent with bone cement from a prior vertebroplasty.
Bilateral pleural effusions are again visualized.
Soft tissue edema and minimal amount of fluid is visualized at the surgical bed and also in the prevertebral space, apparently unchanged since the most recent examination.
IMPRESSION: Evidence of pathological fracture at T2 vertebral body, causing at least 50% of spinal canal stenosis and spinal cord compression as described in detail above.
There is no evidence of frank signal changes within the thoracic spinal cord at the level of the vertebral collapse.
There is evidence of post-vertebroplasty changes at T2 level, with right paraspinal mass and epidural mass involving both neural foramina.
No prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
There is diffuse osteopenia.
The posterior spinous process of C3 appears truncated and there is some overlying subcutaneous emphysema.
Otherwise, no focal lytic or sclerotic lesion is detected.
Allowing for beam angulation, hardware alignment is nominal, without loosening.
THORACIC SPINE: There are bilateral spinal rods.
No obvious focal lytic or sclerotic lesion.
There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
Possible fluid tracking along right lung minor fissure, not fully evaluated here.
No hardware displacement or failure.
Poor visualization of the posterior tip of the C3 spinous process, with nearby locule of subcutaneous air -- ?
Left pleural collapse and/or consolidation and possible fluid layering in the minor fissure.
LE Doppler [**2182-7-22**] Final Report IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
Brief Hospital Course: 63F w/ met renal cell cancer s/p C5-T2 POSTERIOR FUSION by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] on [**2182-7-11**] was admitted with bilateral LE weakness.
MRI and X-ray imaging revealed evidence of pathological fracture at T2 vertebral body, causing at least 50% of spinal canal stenosis and spinal cord compression.
She had minimally distended abdomen but was passing flatus.
KUB done [**7-26**] showed dilated loops of bowel.
Meclizine 12.5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for vertigo.
