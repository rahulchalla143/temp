Patient is otherwise at baseline level of interactiveness and is asymptomatic.
She experienced increased seizure activity on the day after admission with several minor seizures and one generalized tonic-clonic seizure.
Her Keppra dose was increased to 100mg PO BID and she was discharged to follow-up without further increased seizure activity.
Potential considered etiologies of patient's hypothermia included hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism, hypopituitarism, hypothalamic dysfunction related to seizure, drug-induced, or inactivity.
Her degree of hypothermia was mild without electrolyte or EKG abnormalities.
Anxiolytics could cause hypothermia, but less likely as patient has been on ativan for a long time without frequent episodes of hypothermia.
Endocrinology felt that her steroids could be tapered down from the stress dosing given no obvious infectious source and rapid resolution of her hypothermia with active rewarming.
Exact nature of hypothermia may be multifactorial and has resolved without obvious precipitating factors.
Seizure Disorder: Patient has a long history of rather refractory seizure disorder leading to multiple AED's and [**Age over 90 15741**] implantation.
She reportedly has multiple small seizure episodes weekly requring activation of the [**Age over 90 15741**].
Patient possibly has hypothermia related to hypothalamic involvement with a seizure.
Patient had a witnessed, short lasting seizure in ED, and another one in the ICU.
An infectious source was considered as a precipitant, but no source was identified by discharge and she had no elevated white count or other sign or symptom of infection.
Secondary Hypothyroidism: Patient has long-standing hypothyroidism and this presentation with hypothermia was unlikely an exacerbation of that underlying condition.
Secondary Hypoadrenalism: Patient is on maintenance dose of hydrocortisone at home, but it was initially unclear if her hypothermia represented acute adrenal insufficiency.
This is unlikely given absence of electrolyte abnormalities and normotension but patient was treated empirically with stress dose steroids for a day given her hypothermia and concern for hypoadrenalism.
Endocrine was consulted and felt hypoadrenism is unlikely.
Intellectual Disability: Patient has had significant intellectual disability resulting from parietal astrocytoma resection and long course of seizure disorder.
