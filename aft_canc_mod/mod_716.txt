1) Pauses: Attributed to calcium channel blocker overload in the setting of renal failure, perhaps with contribution of electrolyte abnormalities also due to renal failure.
There were no further pauses on telemetry.
2) Hyperkalemia: In the setting of recent increases in his diuretic dosages for treatment of his ascities, poor PO intake and decreased UOP, we felt that the patient sufferred from acute on chronic renal failure from over-diuresis, which subsequently lead to his electrolyte abnormalities.
3) Acute on chronic renal failure (with a baseline of 1.7-1.9) in the setting of aggressive diuresis post admission for anasarca.
5) HTN: As above, patient's K-sparing diuretic was stopped secondary to hyperkalemia.
6) Chronic Pain: Unchanged from baseline throughout course.
7) Chronic Anxiety: Stable throughout course.
