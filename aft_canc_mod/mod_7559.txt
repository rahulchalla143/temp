Admission Date:  [**2104-9-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2104-9-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2052-1-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**] Chief Complaint: Displaced Nephrostomy Tube, Hyponatremia   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Nephrostomy tube placement   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 52 y/o F with a h/o stage IV appendiceal adenocarcinoma recently complicated by pseudomonal urosepsis from bilateral hydronephrosis requiring the placement of bilateral nephrostomy tubes who presents from home after one of the tubes has been displaced.
She was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2104-9-3**], at which time she was found to have pseudomonal urosepsis and was discharged on ciprofloxacin 400mg IV BID to complete a 14 day course, during that hospital stay she was also found to be hyponatremic with a sodium in the high 120's, thought to be due to SIADH.
Her EKG was NSR at 97bpm, no peaked T-waves or PR prolongation, poor R wave progression.
By report, after multiple discussions in the ER she refused kayexelate and placement of a peripheral IV, although she would like the nephrostomy tubes replaced for comfort, as she is no longer seeking treatment for her underlying cancer and is DNR/DNI on home hospice.
She says that her pain is improved after the pain medication, she has no other complaints.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or changes in bowel habits.
Past Medical History: Stage IV appendiceal adenocarcinoma (pT3 Nx pM1b); K-Ras mutation confirmed - [**2102-11-3**]: Presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for progressive abdominal/pelvic discomfort.
CT demonstrated "marked abnormal distention of the endometrial cavity measuring up to 6.5 cm" which was filled with high-density fluid.
There was a possible mass within the cervix as well as a 2.2 x 3.2 cm cystic lesion within the right adnexa.
TVUS revealed an enlarged right ovary with a complex cyst thought to be hemorrhagic, as well as an abnormal endometrial cavity containing a heterogeneous lesion with mixed solid and cystic elements, thought to be concerning for neoplasm.
- [**2102-12-11**]: Endometrial biopsy demonstrated adenocarcinoma, endometroid type, grade I.
- [**2102-12-12**]: Re-presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with continued lower abdominal pain as well as about a month's worth of vaginal bleeding.
There was evidence of gross tumor on the anterior surface  of the uterus.
The left fallopian tube and ovary were also replaced by hemorrhagic mass.
Intraoperatively, she  underwent rigid proctoscopy which showed no evidence of intralumenal tumor.
Peritoneal washings were negative for malignant cells.
Surprisingly, the pathology from this operation  revealed the primary source of her cancer to actually be the appendix with a 1.5 cm histologic grade II primary lesion invading through the muscularis propria and into the subserosa/mesoappendix (pT3).
There  was no perineural invasion.
- [**2103-3-21**]: Began cycle 1 of FOLFOX; required 20% dose reduction of all medications after cycle 1 due to neutropenia; oxaliplatin stopped after 4 cycles due to neuropathy; completed sixth cycle  on [**2103-8-22**] - [**2104-1-5**]: Presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with small bowel obstruction,  thought to be due to intraperitoneal relapse.
PET CT confirmed FDG-avidity of multiple peritoneal/pelvic implants and several liver masses.
- [**2104-5-15**]: Began cycle 1 of palliative FOLFIRI and bevacizumab;  on day 27, was admitted to the hospital with a colovaginal fistula after complaining of stool per vagina - [**2104-7-15**]: Underwent a complicated surgical takedown of the enterovaginal fistula, diverting ileostomy, and repair of a bladder perforation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
- [**2104-8-2**]: Presented to the ED with abdominal pain and leukocytosis.
Found to have diffuse enteritis with new bilateral  obstructive hydronephrosis and progression of peritoneal and hepatic metastases.
Family History: She denies any family history of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, or colon cancer.
CXR: IMPRESSION: Increased right moderate right effusion and right basilar pneumonia.
EKG: NSR at 97bpm, no peaked T-waves or PR prolongation, poor R wave progression   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 52 y/o F with a h/o stage IV appendiceal carcinoma who presented after her right nephrostomy tube had dislodged, found to be hyponatremic and hyperkalemic, with a Cr above her baseline on labs.
#) Hyponatremia: Etiology not completely clear based on her urine lytes or serum osms, likely has a component of hypovolemic hyponatremic, while on exam she appeared total body volume up, her JVD was flat and her MM dry.
Her urine lytes show a low urine sodium and high osms, consistent with hypovolemic hyponatremia, however she does not appear as sodium avid on labs as one would expect, this could be due to a degree of [**Last Name (un) **] as her Cr is up to 0.8 from her baseline of 0.2-0.3.
Also likely a component of SIADH in the setting of malignancy.
#) Hyperkalemia: potassium was 6.4 on admission with no EKG changes, improved to 5.4 after calcium gluconate, insulin and D50, possibly related to worsening renal function.
Patient was monitored on telemetry and did not develop any arrhythmias.
#) Leukocytosis: At the time of her recent discharge she had a leukocytosis in the mid-twenties, now elevated to the mid 30's, no evidence of infection on exam.
Does have right basilar opacity, but chest x-ray appears largely unchanged from [**8-30**].
#) [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr up to 0.8 from 0.2 to 0.3 as a recent baseline, given her hypovolemia on exam was likely pre-renal, however may also be partially due to an obstructive picture given dislodged urostomy tube on the right and the left is not draining.
Ativan 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Displaced nephrostomy tube Hyponatremia Hyperkalemia Metastatic appendiceal adenocarcinoma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You also had some abnormalities in your blood work with low sodium and high potassium.
