There is no change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette, left retrocardiac consolidation which in part is representing atelectasis as well as pulmonary edema.
No pneumothorax is seen.
Interval bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
No evidence of focal infiltration to suggest pneumonia.
No evidence of intra-abdominal abscess, bowel obstruction or fluid collection.
Soft tissue mass with lysis of the anterior left acetabulum as well as soft tissue mass arising from the right pleura with associated destruction in the posterolateral right fifth rib.
Multiple healed right-sided rib fractures.
Punctate, non-obstructing bilateral renal calculi.
[**12-28**] ECHO: Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**12-26**] Hip Xray: IMPRESSION: Enlarging metastasis left hemipelvis.
Low lung volumes.
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and stable cardiomegaly.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with ESRD on HD, pHTN, dCHF, presents with fevers, respiratory distress and hypotension of unknown etiology now resolved, although with persistent delerium.
All infectious workup was negative except for MRSA in a sputum culture.
Pt was emperically treated with 14 day course of vanc as well as an 8 day course of Meropenem for pneumonia and question of a line infection.
TTE was performed which showed EF of 50% and no obvious vegetations.
Pt remains afebrile, with no leukocytosis without signs of infection.
Her WBC was 11 on discharge, which has been around 9 or 10 since admission, but there are no signs of infection.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt presented to the emergency department with respiratory distress and was satting 92% on NRB.
Etiology was unclear, pneumonia vs volume overload.
Pt was treated emperically for a possible pneumonia with Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] though all cultures were negative and CXR without clear evidence of consolidation.
Pt was eventually extubated and her respiratory status consistently imrpoved to now only on 2L NC.
She still appears volume overload with peripheral edema, and HD is trying to remove fluid as blood pressure tolerates.
They recommended to consider giving albumin if hypotensive during dialysis for BP support.
# Diarrhea: Pt had diarrhea, likely secondary to antibiotics.
There was no evidence of C. Difficile infection.
Her WBC were 11, which was only slightly above baseline.
# Delirium/pain control: Pt was intially sedated while intubated.
After extubation, pt mental status was slow to improve.
Pt was on Buproprion, which was later discontinued as it was giving no benefit.
Pt does get frequent Oxycodone for pain control, which may be currently contributing to her mental status.
Her pain is usually in her R breast.
Her family refers to it as zoster pain, but there is a metastatic breast cancer mass on the rib in that area, which is likely the cause of the pain.
Of note, on her home meds, lyrica and her temazepam were stopped to see if her mental status would improve.
It will likely be helpful to seek the aid of palliative care in the future to help manage pain and keep balance between pain and the side effects of pain meds.
# Transaminitis: Pt noted to have a rise in her LFTs.
[**Month (only) 116**] have been secondary to mild shock liver in setting of initial hypotension.
# Hyperglycemia: Pt had elevated sugars, especially in the setting of steroids for her hypotension.
Pt is tolerating the tube feeds realtively well with low residuals.
# Atrial fibrillation/Tachy/Brady syndrome: Pt was supratherapeutic on Coumadin intially.
Rate control was not given because of her low blood pressures.
# Chronic diastolic CHF: Pt is getting UF with HD.
No evidence of heart failure seen in her respiratory status, but is anasarcic.
# Metastatic breast carcinoma: Pt is s/p palliative radiation to hip, is followed by an oncologist at [**Hospital1 2025**] but currently off treatment due to GI intolerance.
Hip films on admission showed enlarged hip metastasis but causing no pain or discomfort currently.
# Skin impairments: Pt has very sensitive skin, with multiple skin tears.
Pt also has a stage II ulcer on coccyx.
She also has a fungal rash around her fingernails for which she is on antifungal powder.
# Hemorrhoids: bothered her while she was here, was treated with tucks pads; she had no bleeding problems while here.
*** ADDENDUM: The morning after the patient was discharged, the lab called to report a positive c.diff sample.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Sepsis Respiratory Failure Pneumonia ESRD on HD Delerium Metastatic breast cancer (to rib/hip) Afib on Coumadin  Secondary diagnosis: Hypothyroidism Diastolic CHF Anemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with low blood pressure and respiratory distress.
You were treated for pnuemonia and a line infection with a course of antibiotics.
You were getting dialysis while here because of your renal disease.
You continue to have intermittent low blood pressures.
Dialysis will continue to try to keep getting excess fluid off as your blood pressure tolerates.
You also continue to have some confusion.
This is likely related to ICU delerium and all the medications you had that have sedating side effects.
You need to continue the tube feeds until your swallowing improves.
You also had elevated liver enzymes, which were likely related to your low blood pressures.
Your platelets were also low, likely from the acute illness.
You also had some sleeping problems.
The changes to your medications at this time are: - stopped lyrica and tempazepam - stopped wellbutrin - stopped atorvastatin (because of your liver) - stopped protonix (because of your platelets) - changed coumadin from 2 mg to 1.5 mg (your inr was 2.0 on discharge) - started insulin for high blood sugars - started midodrine for low blood pressures   Followup Instructions: Please follow up with your rehab doctors.
