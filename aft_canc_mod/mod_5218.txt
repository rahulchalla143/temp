The pt was originally admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital in [**State 1727**] [**2157-7-14**] (was there on vacation) with back pain and found on CT to have bowel wall thickening and numerous intraperitoneal and hepatic lesions consistent with metastatic disease.

She was found to have new small pleural effusion on her left lung base on cxray and was started on levoquin.
She denies having cough, SOB, CP or other respiratory symptoms.
She was afebrile and her vitals were stable with SBP 110s-120s/50s-60s, HR in 60s.

Within 24 hours she had two more episodes of SVTs, again requiring adenosine, so cardiology was consulted who recommended increasing her dose of metoprolol from 50 mg a day to 100 mg a day.

Redemonstration of masses in the liver and porta hepatis, which were characterized to better effect on the comparison CT. 3.
No hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.
Non-specific isoechoic projection into the ascites in the pelvis.
This raises the possibility of carcinomatosis in this patient with disseminated neoplastic disease.

On the day of admission, Mrs. [**Known lastname 23306**] came to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and was found to have electrolyte abnormalities with increase in her K to 5.7, creatine to 1.4 from baseline of (0.4-0.5), and elevated transaminitis with increase t.bili to 2.6.
She also had an elevated WBC at 19.8 with left shift.
She was afebrile and had only one episode of hypotension at 88/57 for which she responded appropriately to 1 L of IV fluids.
She was found to have new small pleural effusion on her left lung base on cxray and was started on levoquin.
She denies having cough, SOB, CP or other respiratory symptoms.
She remained afebrile and her vitals remained stable with SBP in 110s-120s/50s-60s, HR in 60s.
There was a concern for acute liver failure and/or portal obstruction.
Pt had known metastatic disease to the liver.
A liver US w/ doppler was done in the middle of the night which showed patent portal venous system, redemonstration of masses in the liver and porta hepatis, no hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis, non-specific isoechoic projection into the ascites in the pelvis.
This raises the possibility of carcinomatosis in this patient with disseminated neoplastic disease.
Pt was afebrile and had no active signs of infection.
Her lactate was elevated and this was thought to possibly be due to hypovolemia and dehydration, since it had been trending down with IV fluids.
However given that pt had metastatic colon cancer to liver and peritoneum pt could have GN infection.
Even before receiving these antibiotics, on the morning after admission, she suddenly became bradycardic and PEA arrested.
