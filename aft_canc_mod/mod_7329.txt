Admission Date:  [**2123-4-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2123-4-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2045-11-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Meningioma causing inability to walk.
She was diagnosed with a parasagittal meningioma in [**2115**], and underwent cyberknife radiosurgery from [**2122-10-19**] to [**2122-10-23**].
Her dex treatment was complicated by steroid myopathy as outlined by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**].
Over the past several months patient has noticed progressive worsening of her gait requiring a walker.
Over the past two weeks has barely been able to ambulate at all, has had increased frequency of falls (most recently last night when getting up to go to the BR during the night, no LOC).
She does have troubles with her arms - she had a left rotator cuff tear and has lots of pain in the left shoulder for the past 2-3 months.
She denies urinary or bowel incontinence.
She complains of nonrhythmic shaking of the RUE, that is somewhat suppressible but not entirely, not thought to be seizures per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**].
The shaking fluctuates, and has been present for the past 6 months or so, and currently is not "that severe" (appears to be a low amplitude tremor).
When off dex, her gait/leg weakness worsens.
Past Medical History: Parasagittal meningioma as above HTN Glaucoma Right wrist fracture Recent dental tooth extraction Left rotator cuff repair Pelvic prolapse repair Cataract extraction   Social History: Originally from [**Location (un) 3156**], lives w/husband (who recently had a mild stroke) in [**Location (un) **]; one son, no [**Name2 (NI) **]/etoh/drugs.
Not working, no prior career.
Family History: No illnesses per patient  Physical Exam: VITALS:  68, 132/79, 14, 98%RA GEN:  obese elderly woman laying in stretcher, NAD SKIN:  multiple bruises on her legs HEENT:  NC/AT, anicteric sclera, mmm NECK: supple CHEST:  normal respiratory pattern, CTA bilat CV:  regular rate and rhythm with+ systolic murmur ABD:  soft, nontender, nondistended, +BS, no HSM EXTREM:  left leg is swollen (recent US [**2-22**] shows no clot)  NEURO: Mental status: Patient is alert, awake, pleasant affect.
Language is fluent with good comprehension, repetition, no dysarthria.
No apraxia, no neglect.
Able to calculate, no left/right mismatch.
Fundoscopic exam: no papilledema.
No nystagmus or ptosis.
[**Doctor First Name 81**]:  unable to test due to pain XII:  tongue midline without atrophy or fasciculations.
Sensory:  Has decreased proprioception right big toe to only large movements, decreased vibration right toe only as well.
Motor: Diffuse muscle wasting, slightly increased tone bilateral legs with some paratonia.
Unable to test drift due to shoulder pain left.
Mild postural tremor RUE (or so it appears as it gets worse with posture).

************This report contains an addendum***********  PRELIMINARY DIAGNOSIS:  #1, BIFRONTAL TUMOR BIOPSY (including intraoperative smear #1):  MENINGIOMA with prominent nucleoli, sheeting, and nuclear pleomorphism.
#2, LEFT TUMOR NODULE (including intraoperative smear #2 and frozen section #2):  Await processing.
#3, PARASAGITTAL MASS RESECTION:  Await processing.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: #1, BIFRONTAL TUMOR BIOPSY (including intraoperative smear #1):  MENINGIOMA with prominent nucleoli and nuclear pleomorphism.
#2, LEFT TUMOR NODULE (including intraoperative smear #2):  MENINGIOMA with prominent nucleoli, spindle cell component, recent/early organizing geographic necrosis, and nuclear pleomorphism.
#3, PARASAGITTAL MASS RESECTION:  MENINGIOMA with spindle cell and transitional components, prominent nucleoli, focal edema, and nuclear pleomorphism.
NOTE: This tumor has several worrisome features, including its prominent nucleoli and nuclear pleomorphism.
In many fields in the third specimen, the tumor consists of a spindle-cell neoplasm, reminiscent of a solitary fibrous tumor.
These fields are interrupted by areas of diagnostic transitional meningioma histology.
The transitional component becomes hypercellular focally and shows prominent nucleoli and pleomorphism, although mitotic figures remain rare.
Some high-grade features could be a result of either the tumor grade or the effects of treatment.
The paucity of mitotic figures may not reflect this tumor's actual growth potential because of these effects.
A small portion is used to prepare an intraoperative smear.
The intraoperative diagnosis by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 122**] reads:  "Bifrontal tumor (smear):       Meningioma with prominent nucleoli and pleomorphism (some atypical features).
The specimen consists of multiple small pieces of soft tan-pink tissue measuring 1.0 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm in aggregate.
Part 2 is additionally labeled "left side tumor nodule" and consists of a firm tan white lobulated soft tissue mass measuring 2.3 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm.
The intraoperative diagnosis by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 122**] reads:  "#2, Left side tumor nodule (smear #2, FS#2):       Consistent with meningioma with necrosis.
Part 3 is additionally labeled "parasagittal tumor" and consists of a firm tan pink lobulated soft tissue mass measuring 4.8 x 2.9 x 2.5 cm.
The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal both smooth tan white glistening and tan white focally fibrotic and hemorrhagic appearing cut surfaces.
The specimen is represented in D-G.   Brief Hospital Course: 77 yo RH female with h/o HTN, glaucoma, and known parasagittal meningioma s/p cyberknife 5 months ago who returned after an MRI showed growth of tumor.
This is likely due to her tumor and edema.
She is not a risk free candidate for surgery given the location of her tumor and its proximity to the superior sagittal sinus.
The neurosurgery team met with the patient and her family and discussed the significant risk associated with this procedure.
She was initially given dexamethasone given the swelling of the tumor, however, this was not continued in the hospital due to concern that it might impair healing and increase her chances of infection with surgery.
She transferred to neuro ICU  for close hemodynamic and neurologic monitoring.
There no intra operative complications occurred.
Estimated blood loss during surgery is 500cc.
Postoperative Head CT revealed status post large parafalx meningioma removal with minimal postoperative hemorrhage is present.
Postoperative intracranial air and vasogenic edema is unchanged.
Patient kept on high dose dexamethasone postoperatively due to vasogenic edema, and kept on 100% FiO2 for postop pneumocephalus for 24 hours .
Postoperative MRI suggests status post resection of parasagittal meningioma with small area of residual enhancement is seen in the left parasagittal region.
Blood products are seen at the surgical site with several venous collaterals secondary to resection of superior sagittal sinus.
No acute infarct is seen.
Patient developed worsening edema of both hands bilaterally [**4-19**] and her fluid balance was positive 1-2L.Her IVF stopped and started on Lasix for diuresis with improvement of edema and achieved evolumia.
Noted to have decreased urine output overnight and appeared dry, was then restarted on IV fluids with adequate urine output.
On exam on [**4-20**] was noted to have persistent UE edema localized to both hands.
Withdraws to pain Right LE, moves Left LE voluntarily.
Persistent Left UE focal motor seizure most notable at shoulder and hand.
Her official pathology result is MENINGIOMA with spindle cell and transitional component(see details in pertinent result section in this summary).
Report any fever greater than 101.5, or any other neurologic symptoms that may be concerning.
