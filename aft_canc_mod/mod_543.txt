s/p closure with rentention sutures [**2-25**], s/p Trach [**3-9**], s/p open drainage of splenic abscess [**3-26**]   History of Present Illness: This 60-year-old man has COPD and coronary artery disease as well as bipolar depression and he originally presented with two weeks of nausea, diarrhea, dark colored urine and jaundice.
He has been suffering from upper respiratory symptoms for the last three weeks and saw his pulmonologist who started on antibiotics for the steroid taper.
He reported diarrhea at this time and he actually had C. diff colitis identified.
He reports no change in appetite, recent weight loss or other particular symptoms.
He underwent an ERCP/stent placement on [**1-27**] which showed a distal CBD stricture and atypical cells.
CTA abdomen showed a 3.6 cm head of pancreas mass.
He had a Whipple and J-tube on [**2150-2-19**]   Past Medical History: COPD (Chronic Bronchitis, Emphysema), CAD, OSA (thumbs, right shoulder and neck), Melanoma, Bipolar/manic depression, sleep apnea, Hx C.diff  PSH: Cardiac Stent x4 ([**2145**]), Melanoma excision (abdomen) [**2140**]  Social History: Lives alone in [**Location (un) 5289**].
Family History: Mother with breast CA   Physical Exam: Gen: Looks a bit disheveled, but is awake and oriented x3 and fully conversant.
HEENT: No evidence of scleral icterus at this point.
Abd: soft, nontender, and nondistended with positive bowel sounds and is quite protuberant and rotund.
Ext: show no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.
Mild pulmonary edema is new, accompanied by increased caliber to mediastinal and hilar vessels.
Small left pleural effusion is presumed.
Small left pleural effusion is presumed.
No pneumothorax.
FINDINGS: There are low lung volumes.
Increased diffuse density of the left hemithorax is most likely due to layering pleural effusion.
Cardiac silhouette is accentuated by the low lung volumes, appears to be mildly enlarged.
There is engorgement of the mediastinal and pulmonary vasculature with no overt pulmonary edema.
Right lower lobe atelectasis is new.
IMPRESSION: Increased left pleural effusion with increased adjacent atelectasis.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2150-4-12**] 10:18 PM IMPRESSION: Persistent but slightly improved retrocardiac opacity which may be secondary to aspiration, pneumonia, or atelectasis.
Left pleural effusion is unchanged.
Subsegmental right lower lobe atelectasis.
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  [**2150-4-7**] 1:23 PM IMPRESSION: Penetration and intermittent aspiration with thin and nectar consistency barium.
There continued to be bilateral pleural effusions moderate in size that layer posteriorly, given positioning it is unclear but these are likely increased compared to prior.
There is pulmonary vascular re-distribution, perihilar haze consistent with fluid overload.
There is obscuration of both hemidiaphragms due to the effusions and an underlying infiltrate cannot be excluded.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Infarcted spleen and subsequent hematoma is unchanged in size, with indwelling large-bore catheter.
Heterogeneity within the hepatic parenchyma, left lobe, likely due to retractor injury, no definite evidence for infection at this time.
Loculated left pleural effusion with near-complete collapse of the left lower lobe.
Small right effusion and atelectasis.
CT PERITINEAL DRAIN EXCLUDING APPENDICEAL  [**2150-3-21**] 2:39 PM IMPRESSION: Successful CT-guided percutaneous drainage of splenic collection.
Splenic vein thrombosis with extensive splenic infarction.
Interval development of gas within the infarcted splenic parenchyma concerning for infection.
Multiple poorly defined hypoenhancing areas in the left hepatic lobe that may be related to retractor injury.
However, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
Small left pleural effusion and near complete collapse of the left lower lobe.
No definite evidence of enterocutaneous fistula.
However, please note that the small bowel was not well opacified with oral contrast at the time of the examination which limits the sensitivity of this exam.
Neuro: He was awake and alert after extubation and was successfully transitioned to a PCA for pain control.
Cardiac: He initially had a Swan-Ganz catheter, which was removed with stable cardiac function.
He was evaluated by Speech and Swallow and he was cleared for ground solids and nectar thick liquids.
GI: Immediately post-op, he had elevated LFTs but ultrasound of the hepatic vasculature was negative for pathology.
He developed a wound infection that required re-opening of his wound.
With the infection and his concurrent steroids, he eviscerated through his wound after a violent cough.
He was brought back to the OR emergently on [**2-25**] and his wound was irrigated/debrided and primary closed with retention sutures.
He continued to be hypotensive requiring vasopressors for several post-operative days.
An ECHO was obtained which showed intact LV function with no thrombi.
On [**3-7**] he developed an low-output colocutaneous fistula through his abdominal wound.
It's output was bilious and did not appear to have any tube feeds or methylene blue when placed via the NGT.
His wound continued to improved and he will need continued wound care.
ID: He spike fevers intermittently and cultures were positive for:  enterococcus faecium on [**2-21**] in blood x2 bottles, sputum culture for sparse yeast [**2-21**]; Sputum cultures from [**2-26**], [**3-2**], [**3-4**] revealed enterobacter cloacae and he was treated with appropriate ABX.
On [**3-4**] (POD 13 and 7) he developed a fever to 102 and leukocytosis to 34K.
CT showed Infarction of the spleen with thrombosis identified within the splenic vein  and colitis.
He was treated non-operatively with bowel rest for the colitis and an Aspirin for the splenic vein thrombus.
Heme: Pt had consistently decreasing platelet count while on heparin.
CT abd [**3-4**] showed infarction of the spleen with thrombosis.
CT abd [**2150-3-10**] showed splenic abscess, which was drained on [**2150-3-12**] via IR.
His blood sugars continued to be elevated and [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes was seeing him and adjusting his sliding scales.
