#) Thrombocytosis:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed thrombocytosis during this hospital stay.
This was thought to be secondary to reactive thrombocytosis due to Pneumonia and STEMI.
Plavix was increased to 75mg [**Hospital1 **] for prevention of thrombosis of his BMS x 4.
Reactive Thrombocytosis is still the most likely cause of his elevated platelet count.
