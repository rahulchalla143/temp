History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 58-year-old right-handed woman with metastatic breast cancer to the brain and ribs currently on HK1-272 04-266 trial, now with chief complaint of witnessed, grand mal seizure.
She initially presented to [**Hospital3 3765**] earlier today after generalized seizure witnessed by her husband.
At [**Hospital1 **], patient given fosphenytoin with subsequent allergic reaction halfway through infusion with pruritis, urticaria, erythema to abdomen.
Head CT was negative for acute process.
Past Medical History: Oncology History: Somewhat unclear as patient longtime patient of [**Hospital1 18**] and no recent synopsis of treatments: -patient with breast cancer with stable mets to brain, ribs -initially diagnosed with right breast cancer in [**2162**].
Biopsy at that time revealed an infiltrating ductal carcinoma and the patient underwent a mastectomy (tumor size was 4.5 cm, ER positive, and Her2neu positive).
-[**2174**]: left hip met -initiated care w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2175**]; XRT and herceptin -Navelbine and Herceptin -Herceptin and carboplatin [**1-27**] -now with brain and rib mets -has been on multiple protocols -currently on HK1-272 04-266 trial with several recent dose reductions, Zometa last received on [**2182-4-16**] -seen in ED on [**2182-3-21**] with rib pain, ruled out for PE, thought to be due to known metastases.
OTHER PMH: Asthma and elevated cholesterol.
General: Restless, moving all extremities all about, alert/oriented, scattered; She is inattentive, and keep needing to re-focus her for history HEENT: MM dry, OP clear but dry; EOMI NECK: supple, no lymphadenopathy, no rigidity BREAST: mastectomy on right; port a cath c/d/i CHEST: CTA; pruritic-uriticarial rash on anterior chest; patient scratching actively CV: RRR, no m/r/g; patient kept talking through exam even when I asked her to be quiet for auscultation ABD: soft non tender,nabs, no masses EXTRM: swaying them around, decreased tone but normal strength NEURO: alert and oriented x 3 but a few seconds later she said " i am going to be transferred to [**Hospital3 **]."
Spelled WORLD foreward but not backward.
On the FLAIR sequence, the extensive white matter edema in the periventricular regions and the left temporal lobe are identified and are similar to the previous examination.
IMPRESSION: Markedly limited study due to patient motion.
Persistent white matter abnormal signal and enhancing focus in the left temporal lobe.
MRI Head [**2182-4-26**]: FINDINGS: Again, two small enhancing lesions are seen in the left frontal cortical and subcortical region with mild surrounding edema.
Additionally, there is an approximately 15 mm enhancing lesion seen in the left temporal lobe with a small adjacent enhancing nodule.
This lesion on axial images appears slightly larger compared to the prior study.
An additional small focus of enhancement is seen adjacent to the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
Diffuse periventricular and subcortical hyperintensities are seen on the FLAIR and T2-weighted images which could be related to small vessel disease and/or radiation therapy.
There is no mass effect or midline shift seen.
There is moderate ventriculomegaly which could be related to atrophy.
There are no other definite areas of abnormal parenchymal or meningeal enhancement seen.
IMPRESSION: Overall, no significant interval change compared to the previous MRI of [**2182-3-27**].
The left frontal and temporal enhancing lesions are again seen with surrounding edema.
A small focus of enhancement is again seen adjacent to the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
Diffuse hyperintensities in the white matter are again noted which could be related to small vessel disease or radiation therapy.
There were no areas of persistant focal slowing, no epileptiform feature.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 58-year-old right-handed woman with metastatic breast cancer to [**Last Name (LF) 500**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], here with new seizures, presumably from disease progression.
On the evening of [**2182-4-24**], she became increasingly confused and agitated requiring restraints and a sitter and she was then no longer able to be managed on the floor.
She was noted to have some phlebitis on her left arm at the site of a prior IV and her husband noted an increase in her urinary urgency.
She had no chest pain, shortness of breath, N/V/D.
Her agitation was possibly due to Benadryl given that she had a similar reaction in the past to phenobarbitol.
Also on ddx was non-convulsive status, infection (?
UTI, ?
(1) Seizure/Mental Status Changes: Her grand mal seizure was intially felt to be most likely from progression of disease.
She had an allergic reaction to fosphenytoin at the outside hospital, so she was loaded with [**Date Range 13401**] on admission here.
She had no recent alcohol use or evidence of withdrawal from her benzodiazepines.
Head CT was negative for acute change.
She recovered from this event with lucid periods, but was sundowning while in the ICU.
Also on ddx were non-convulsive status, infection (?
UTI, ?
MRI of brain on admission was poor due to patient movement but white matter edema in periventricular and left temporal lobe regions seemed similar to one month ago.
EEG was negative for epileptiform features.
Repeat MRI [**2182-4-26**] showed left frontal cortical and subcortical enhancing lesions with mild surrounding edema unchanged from prior, 15 mm lesions left temporal lobe unchanged, and lesion adjacent to occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of right ventricle unchanged.
She was noted by nursing to have multiple attempts to get out of bed when she was instructed not to.
It was felt these symptoms could be a side effect of [**Last Name (LF) 13401**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] her [**First Name3 (LF) 13401**] was weaned to 250 mg po bid from 500 mg po bid and she was started on lamictal 25 mg po bid.
(2) Metastatic Breast Cancer: The pt is currently on protocol drug HKI-272.
She has stable brain mets per MRI and a long history of breast cancer, since [**2163**].
(3) Allergic Reaction: Given her allergic reaction to Dilantin at OSH, she was started on Bendaryl, ranitidine and Zyrtec for her hives.
These medications were discontinued after she was found to have an altered mental status.
cellulitis: Patient had a very subtle area of likely phelbitis over L wrist at site of old IV and restraints.
She has had cellulitis in past.
(7) Tachycardia: She had sinus tachycardia likely due to dehydration and agitation.
She states she has always had a fast heart rate.
(8) Agitation/Restlessness: This was likely initially secondary to her altered mental status and then [**Year (4 digits) 13401**] side effect, as per above.
basis now as her stools have essentially normalized.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for sleep.
Hydrocortisone 2.5 % Cream Sig: One (1) Appl Rectal twice a day as needed for itching: around port site.
Return to the ER if you experience a recurrent seizure or change in mental status (ie confusion).
