LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: mid anterior - hypo; basal inferior - hypo; mid inferior - hypo; basal inferolateral - hypo; mid inferolateral - akinetic; anterior apex - hypo; septal apex - hypo; inferior apex - hypo; lateral apex - akinetic;  RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild (1+) MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.
Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Resting regional wall motion  abnormalities include inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis and distal septal  and apical hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly  thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation  is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
EGD Wednesday, [**2101-2-16**]: Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and an endoscope was introduced through the mouth and advanced under direct visualization until the second part of the duodenum was reached.
There were no complications.
No active bleeding.
Mucosa: Diffuse continuous erythema and congestion of the mucosa with no bleeding were noted in the antrum.
These findings are compatible with mild gastritis.
Excavated Lesions A few non-bleeding erosions were noted in the antrum and fundus.
Duodenum:  Mucosa: Localized continuous erythema and congestion of the mucosa with no bleeding were noted in the duodenal bulb compatible with mild duodenitis.
Impression: Blood in the fundus Erythema and congestion in the duodenal bulb compatible with mild duodenitis Erosions in the antrum and fundus Erythema and congestion in the antrum compatible with mild gastritis Recommendations: Protonix 40 mg Twice daily Serial hematocrits.

: Birth Date: [**2028-6-4**] (72 years) Instrument: PCF 160AL ID#: [**Numeric Identifier 108003**] Medications: Midazolam 1.5mg Fentanyl 75 micrograms  Indications: GI Bleeding   Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and the colonoscope was introduced through the rectum and advanced under direct visualization until the cecum was reached and the ileo-cecal valve was identified.
There were no complications.
Protruding Lesions A single sessile 4 mm non-bleeding polyp of benign appearance was found in the proximal transverse at 67cm.
Small non-bleeding grade 1 internal hemorrhoids were noted.
Excavated Lesions Multiple non-bleeding diverticula with mixed openings were seen in the sigmoid and descending colon.Diverticulosis appeared to be severe.
Impression: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid and descending colon Polyp at 67cm in the proximal transverse Stool in the throughout colon Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids No active bleeding, small avms could have been missed.
Bleeding may have been secondary to diverticulosis which has now resolved.
History: 72 year old male with CAD s/p cath and stent placement, GIB in setting of anticoagulation (ASA, Plavix, Heparin and Integrillin) Additional notes: The attending physician was present for entire procedure.
CAD:  At cardiac cath he was found to have a 100% stenosis in SVG-RCA graft.
Had another episode of his usual angina after transfer to the floor with nonspecific ECG changes and no change in CE.
GIB: In the evening after his cath, he felt felt dizzy when standing, and the next morning large dark bloody stools with large clots.
1 liter NG lavage no blood but no bile back.
Had prior colonoscopy [**1-15**] yrs ago showing diverticulosis and no polyps.
Never had bloody stools for years.
Prior attributed to hemorrhoids which ceased after banding.
No hematemesis.
Left lower quad discomfort mild.
No recent change in stools.
No weight loss or low grade temps.
Seen by GI with EGD (mild gastritits/duodenitis, some erosions, no active bleeding but blood in fundus) and colonoscopy (no active bleeding, small avms could have been missed.
Bleeding may have been secondary to diverticulosis which has now resolved).
CHF: mixed systolic and diastolic heart failure.
ischemic in origin.
A lead sensing threshold very high.
Needs new A lead but needs ICD anyway and wil likely get for EF<35% with CAD and NSVT.
Underlying paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
HTN - Held BP meds given GIB, then restarted imdur and BB.
Pt had transient low BP day meds restarted; suspect combination of medications, low hct and NTG gtt.
