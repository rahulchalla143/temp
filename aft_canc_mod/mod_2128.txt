CXR revealed moderate to large left sided pleural effusion with pleurex drain and minimal interval changes.
Past Medical History: [**7-/2159**]: Diagnosed with non small cell lung cancer by CT guided biopsy [**2159-9-20**]: PET scan with low-attenuation lesion in the left lobe of the thyroid gland measuring 25 x 7 mm in addition to markedly FDG avid left upper lobe mass consistent with known cancer and FDG avid prominent bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy suspicious for metastatic disease, but no pathologically enlarged infraclavicular lymph nodes.
He also had retroperitoneal internal and external iliac chain FDG avid lymphadenopathy considered unusual for lung carcinoma.
[**2159-10-31**]: Left axillary lymph node dissection.
With pathology revealing florid reactive follicular hyperplasia consistent with HIV associated lymphadenopathy.
Other than the visit with his infectious disease on [**2160-5-5**], he then lost to follow up until [**7-13**].
[**2160-7-24**]: CT demonstrated left upper lobe mass minimally increased in size from [**3-/2160**] with a sub 5 mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule with additional stable bilateral nodules, new left-sided pleural effusion.
Pathology revealed 4R lymph nodes with no malignancy but frozen sections showed metastatic large cell carcinoma and 4L lymph nodes that showed metastatic large cell carcinoma.
A level 7 lymph node showed metastatic large cell carcinoma and a parietal pleural biopsy also showed metastatic large cell carcinoma involving the pleura.

Subtle consolidation on the left could be obscured however the right lung remains clear.
No pulmonary embolism.
No significant change in moderate left pleural effusion.
While small loculations of the effusion are associated, the pleural catheter resides within the largest pleural collection.
Nodular thickening and enhancement of the pleura may be secondary to metastatic involvement versus iatrogenic etiologies (i.e.
No significant change in left upper lobe pulmonary mass or innumerable lung metastases.
Diffuse interlobular septal thickening may again represent lymphangitic spread of carcinoma.
Persistant round atelectasis involving a large portion of the left lower lobe.
The extent of the pre-existing left-sided pleural effusion is constant.
The retrocardiac lung areas and the few ventilated left lung areas are clearly atelectatic.
There could be mild displacement of the heart over the midline into the right hemithorax, probably exaggerated by a relatively severe thoracic scoliosis.
However, mild overhydration is seen.
No evidence of pneumothorax, no focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
No new consolidations and no PTX.
Known pituitary/sellar mass is again identified, unchanged but incompletely evaluated.
No large mass lesion separate from this or area of hemorrhage.
Please note that MRI is more sensitive in detection of small lesions and can be considered for assessment of metastatic disease.
Renal ultrasound: No evidence of stones or hydronephrosis in either kidney.
Normal-appearing liver, with no intrahepatic lesion seen.
The common duct is not dilated, and there is no intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
ECHO: No vegetations EGD: mucosal erythema c/w gastritis  pleural fluid at discharge: GRAM STAIN (Final [**2161-11-5**]):       2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.

This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to       hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..     FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2161-11-8**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH   Brief Hospital Course: 62 year old male with a h/o metastatic large cell lung cancer to bone c/b recurrent malignant pleural effusion requiring pleurex catheter placement, HIV (CD4 535) on HAART, htn who presented with dyspnea, unchanged pleural effusion on cxr and low grade fever.
# Coagulase negative staph in pleural fluid, urine: Initially thought to be contaminant but grew in several samples and then in urine.
Blood cultures were all negative and an echocardiogram showed no vegetations.
# Pleural effusion: Drained by IP frequently throughout hospitalization usually followed by improvement in dyspnea.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Likely contrast induced nephropathy though elevation persisted longer than expected.
# Epigastric pain.
# Tachypnea/Anxiety.
Patient was transferred to MICU overnight for tachypnea and respiratory alkalosis with pH of 7.6.
A central drive for respiratory alkalosis was ruled out by CT.
HAART was stopped for [**Last Name (un) **], elevated LFTs.

Your symptoms improved after some fluid was drained from the catheter in your chest.
A CT scan of your chest showed that you did not have any blood clots in your lungs.
You developed mild kidney dysfunction during stay that improved with fluids.
You also developed abdominal pain during your hospitalization.
An endoscopic procedure showed that you had no inflammation in your esophagous, and some mild inflammation in your stomach.
Please call your doctor or 911 if you develop worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, fevers or chills, worsening abdominal pain, persistent vomiting or diarrhea, or any other concerning medical symptoms.
