Physical Exam: AT discharge:  AVSS HEENT: large free flap to right face, doppler signals intact, good cap refill, warm.
He was very agitated post-op and stayed in the unit for a few days secondary to this.
It was necessary that he wasnt agitated as to not damage his new free flap.
This was all done because he failed a swallow evaluation and was high risk for aspiration.
We restarted all his home meds, we got an ECHO, which showed EF 35% and hypokinesis of the inferior LV wall with mild systolic function depression.
This was consistent with his baseline.
He also had b/l LENI's to check on his DVT from [**Month (only) **] and make sure there was no progression.
