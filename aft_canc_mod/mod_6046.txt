Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: HPI: Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 73-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home O2 (4L @ night, 2L in the AM) since [**2205-7-11**], diastolic hf (ef>55%), atrialf fibrillation, history of stroke, HTN, and CAD s/p MI in [**2175**]'s presenting with shortness of breath since last night.
She states she woke up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, used her wheel chair to get to the bathroom, and developed shortness of breath on route.
She mentioned feeling generally uncomfortable throughout the meal, without any focal chest pain or profound SOB.
She reports her SOB with minimal exertion in her wheel chair was "Out of control" and prompted her to call 911.
She reports having a mild dry cough for the last 2-3 days wihtout any sputum production.
Deneis fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, palpiations, dizziness, or syncopal episodes.
Exam in the ED was notable for wheezes throughout with crackles at the bases.
A bedside US was performed which showed no effusion, and CXR was consistent with b/l pulmonary edema.
EKG showed aflutter without RVR, and no ischemic changes.
Denies any chest pain, profound SOB, or discomfort.
Primary CNS lymphoma in cerebellum, frontal lobes, left temporal lobe, and right occipital lobe - dx in [**7-16**] - S/p 6 cycles of high dose MTX, changed to Rituxan and Temodar  in [**9-16**], last cycle [**10-17**].
Hypertension 4.
Hyperlipidemia 5.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage (while on coumadin for stroke.
Hypothyroidism/multinodular goiter -seen by endo, has MNG and  chronically low TSH for unclear reasons 8.
CAD s/p MI in the 80s 9.
Atrial fibrillation - not on coumadin due to subarachnoid hemorrhage 12.
Neovascular glaucoma complicated by right eye blindness-not compliant with drops 14.
Only intermittent mild Hyper Ca [**10**].
Mild Vit D def 16.
OSA- severe mixed sleep disorder breathing   Social History: Home: lives in [**Hospital1 **] senior living; ambulates with a cane, but also uses a wheelchair as needed Occupation: retired [**Hospital1 18**] nurse, previously worked on 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] as a gynecology nurse EtOH: Denies Drugs: Denies Tobacco: 90 pack-year smoking history (3 PPD x 30 years), quit smoking in [**2178**]  Family History: Father - Esophageal problems, unsure of the specifics, hx of [**Name (NI) 5895**] Mother - Bradycardia, AAA   Physical Exam: General: Morbidly Obese female, on face mask O2 Vital signs: HR: 90, SPO2 93% on 10L facemask, BP 160/80, RR 22 HEENT:  Anicteric sclera.
No oral lesions or ulcers noted.
Neck: Palpalbe mass on right side of neck c/w history of thyroid goiter abotu 3cm x 2cm.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated, no carotid bruits.
Abdomen: obese abdomone.
1+ DPP/PTP pulses.
EKG ([**2205-12-17**]): Atrial fibrillation with diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities are non-specific.
Since the previous tracing of [**2205-8-24**] ventricular rate is slower and further ST-T wave changes are present.
CXR ([**2205-12-17**]): Diffuse hazy opacity with pulmonary vascular indistinctness and left pleural effusion likely bilateral, most consistent with volume overload and congestive failure.
If indicated, consider repeat radiography after appropriate diuresis to assess for underlying infection.
CTA Chest With and Without Contrast ([**2205-12-17**]):Right upper lobe ground-glass opacity which is stable since [**2203-8-5**], merits a 12-month followup to assess for stability.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 73 yo female with multiple medical issues including pmhx of primary CNS lymphoma, diastolic HF, cad s/p MI, afib, hx of stroke, OSA and COPD on home oxygen p/w shortness of breath for the last 24 hours.
#  Shortness of breath:  Patient's presentation was perplexing for pulmonary cause vs. cardiovascular cause.
While patient carries a history of COPD, recent pulmonary function tests were s/o restrictive lung disease, with FEV1/FVC>95%.
DLCO <35% as well, s/o interstitial lung disease, severe CHF, emphysmea, or PE.
Given hypoxia refractory to nebulzier treatments, BNP>1800, and CXR that shows effusions and mild vascular congestion, pulmonary congestion thought to be contributing to SOB.
Negative for ACS, and did not have infectious presentation.
Negative for PE but did show incidental, stable since [**7-/2203**] ground glass opacity near RUL to be folowed up w/ in 1 year.
SOB thought to be [**2-12**] chronic OSA, and pulmonary effusions from dCHF.
Oxygenation with CPAP thought to dilate pulmonary vasculature, increasing right to left side filliing/CO/renal perfusion and diuresis.
#Afib:  In aflutter w/out rapid ventricular rate.
Given body habitus and restrictive state, began CPAP with oxygen.
Does not appear to be on BB, probably [**2-12**] symptomatic bradycardia (see above).
#Hx of stroke/CAD/MI:  continued HTN control, HLD control, and ASA for secondary prevention.
#Hypothyroidism/multinodular goiter: seen by endo, has MNG and chronically low TSH for unclear reasons.
#Neovascular glaucoma complicated by right eye blindness: continued Timolol, latansoprost, and brimodine drops.
