He developed a "high fever" and chills with a nonproductive cough on [**12-29**] and came in to the ED after developing dyspnea [**12-30**].
He had chest discomfort with coughing, but no pleuritic pain and no hemoptysis.
No known sick contacts or recent travel, denies h/o +PPD but not sure when this last was done.
His chest film showed a RLL opacity and he was started empirically on vancomycin, ceftazidime, and levofloxacin.
last seen in clinic [**12-28**] cytoxan held for WBC 1.5, velcade given however 2. s/p DDRT [**2187-11-3**], graft failing now back on HD - on tacrolimus, cellcept held in setting of cyclophosphamide tx - still makes some urine 3. h/o ESRD secondary to HTN on HD from [**2183**]-[**2187**] thought at that time to be [**2-2**] HTN 4. s/p L AVF [**2-3**] 5.
HTN 6.
Family History: noncontributory   Physical Exam: Exam [**Location (un) 3242**] floor [**12-31**] Tmax 102.8 (4:30pm [**12-30**] in ED) T 99.6 P 96 BP 126/71 RR 22 O2 95% RA General: Appears older than stated age, coughing occasionally in mild respiratory distress HEENT: Sclera white, conjunctiva pale, moist mucus membranes, no thrush or other oral lesions.
R eyelid slight swollen Neck: No cervical or supraclavicular adenopathy Pulm: Speaking in full sentences.
There is a patchy opacity in the right lower lobe, highly suspicious for pneumonia.
Volume status has normalized since the prior examination.
No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION:  Limited examination, highly suspicious for right lower lobe pneumonia.
If clinically feasible, PA and lateral views in the radiology suite are recommended for better characterization.
[**12-31**] CXR PA/LAT: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**12-30**], there is again an area of patchy opacification in the right lower lobe, highly suspicious for pneumonia given the clinical history of immunesuppression.
Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some increase in pulmonary venous pressure persists.
[**1-3**] Lspine plain films AP AND LATERAL LUMBAR SPINE: There is spondylosis of the L5 vertebral body without evidence of spondylolisthesis.
No discrete bony lesions are identified within the imaged bones to account for the patient's pain.
Multiple calcifications in the right lower quadrant likely represent central calcifications from prior right renal transplant.
IMPRESSION: No discrete osseous lesion within the imaged lumbar spine to account for the patient's symptoms.
L5 spondylosis without spondylolisthesis, unchanged since [**2187-11-27**].
Pneumonia: Due to his initial tachypnea and fever he was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for close monitoring.
He was initially treated empirically with broad spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and ceftazidime due to recent hospitalization.
Antibiotic treatment lead to rapid improvement in his respiratory status and fever curve.
A bacterial etiology due to an encapsulated organism such as pneumococcus seemed most likely.
It was felt that his persistent leukocytosis at time of discharge reflected his treatment with neupogen as clinically he was much improved from a respiratory standpoint.
Prophalaxis with acyclovir and bactrim was continued.
Per renal, dialysis sessions should be conservative in regards to volume removed.
Chest pain and back pain: The patient complained of chest and low back discomfort overnight [**2188-1-3**].
A cardiac etiology of the chest pain was thought unlikely given unchanged EKG and reproducibility of chest discomfort with palpation over the right throax.
In regards to his back pains, he had no neurologic findings concerning for cord compression and plain films of his lumbar spine revealed no fracture or other acute pathology.
He was started on a fentanyl patch with oxycodone prn breakthrough for pain relief.
