Admission Date:  [**2182-6-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2182-6-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2128-11-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: CT guided needle biopsy Intubation Arterial cannulation, a-line placement Central line placement  History of Present Illness: Pt is a 53 Y M with Hx of DM2, HTN who is transferred from [**Hospital3 **] after being hospitalized from [**6-5**] - [**6-12**] with bilateral pneumonia and concern for new malignancy.
2 weeks prior to admission to the OSH, he was experiencing cold-like symptoms and received Azithromycin without relief.
At the end of that time, he was coughing to where "my face turned [**Doctor Last Name 352**]" and had some sputum production and low-grade fevers.
He received a CXR which showed bilateral PNA; he was admitted to the [**Hospital1 2436**] ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and Pneumosepsis.
On [**6-5**] he started Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin, and IV steroids for supposed concurrent COPD exacerbation.
Urinary Legionella Ag and strep Ag were negative as were MRSA screen and blood cultures drawn on [**6-5**].
CTPA was negative for PE but did reveal mediastinal and retroperitoneal adenopathy.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis a 6.3x4.8cm mass, "concern for a renal cell carcinoma vs.
The patient was agreeable for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for work-up of this potential malignancy.
On arrival, he mentions orthopnea and LE edema which began around the time he started his cold and has worsened.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denies dysuria, stool or urine incontinence.
Denies rashes or skin breakdown.
Past Medical History: PMH: Bilateral PNA DM2 on Metformin HTN Hyponatremia Atypical chest pain with a normal stress test in [**2179**] Hyperlipidemia Asthma as a child OSA Seasonal allergies  Social History: Works in IT.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
CHEST: Resp slightly labored, Crackles at bases with expiratory wheezes from bases to apices.
CXR from [**Hospital1 2436**]: bilateral PNA with pleural effusions.
There is no supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy.
There is extensive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, similar in extent to the prior study from only a few days earlier.
Large right hilar nodal conglomerate, measures 4.9 cm in maximal dimension (4:28) compared to 4.8 cm.
Left hilar adenopathy measures 4.1 cm (4:29) compared to 4.3 cm.
There is resultant compression of the right main stem bronchus (4:27) and bronchus intermedius as well as the right lower lobe bronchus.
The heart has a rounded appearance with a small pericardial effusion.
This concerning for pericardial constriction from underlying process involving the lungs and mediastinum.
LUNGS:  In the right upper lobe there are multiple foci of consolidation, multiple nodules, ground-glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening.
More frank consolidation with air bronchograms are present in the right middle lobe and left lower lobe.
There are bilateral pleural effusions greater on the right, similar in extent compared to the prior study.
These findings are suggestive of primary lung malignancy, lymphoma, possible infection such as tuberculosis and less likely vasculitis.
There is no pneumothorax.
This study is limited for evaluation of subdiaphragmatic structures but demonstrates extensive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, better assessed on the recent outside hospital scan with IV contrast, however, the overall extent appears unchanged.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There are no suspicious bony lesions.
Multifocal process within the lungs with frank consolidation in the right middle and left lower lobes, severe multifocal opacities with nodules, centrilobular septal thickening in the right upper lobe and less extensive in the right lower lobe with multiple nodules in the left upper lobe.
Associated compression of the right main stem bronchus, bronchus intermedius and right lower lobe bronchus from lymphadenopathy.
Rounded appearance to the heart, with small pericardial effusion suggesting pericardial constriction from this underlying process.
Bilateral pleural effusions, worse on the right, unchanged from the prior exam.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage.
There are areas of increased FLAIR signal corresponding to punctate foci of slow diffusion within the bilateral parietal lobes, the left frontal lobe, and the left temporal and occipital lobes.
There is also a focus of slow diffusion within the left cerebellar hemisphere.
There is no evidence of mass lesion or hemorrhage.
There are no definite areas of abnormal enhancement.
Multiple foci of slow diffusion in both cerebral hemispheres, as well as in the left cerebellar hemisphere, without enhancement.
These are compatible with acute/subacute ischemia, likely from a central embolic source.
[**6-19**] TISSUE BIOPSY PATHOLOGY Pleural fluid, cell block:  Consistent with metastatic poorly-differentiated carcinoma (see note).
[**Last Name (un) **]-31 shows focal dim staining in rare tumor cells.
WT-1 highlights background mesothelial cells.
The patient's prior pathology specimen S12-33153P was also reviewed for comparison.
The morphologic and immunophenotypic findings are consistent with poorly-differentiated carcinoma similar to that described in the patient's para-aortic node specimen (S12-33153P).
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 **] after being hospitalized from [**6-5**] - [**6-12**] with bilateral pneumonia and concern for new malignancy.
On [**6-5**] he started Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin, and IV steroids for supposed concurrent COPD exacerbation.
Urinary Legionella Ag and strep Ag were negative as were MRSA screen and blood cultures drawn on [**6-5**].
CTPA was negative for PE but did reveal mediastinal and retroperitoneal adenopathy.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis a 6.3x4.8cm mass, "concern for a renal cell carcinoma vs.
He reported that orthopnea and LE edema began around the time he started his respiratory symptoms.
While in house, he had left para-aortic lymph node biopsy [**2182-6-13**] which showed poorly differentiated carcinoma with clear cell features.
MRI brain was concerning for acute/subacute ischemia from central embolic source with no vegetations on TTE.
on [**2182-6-19**] CXR was suggestive of superimposed pneumonia (vanc and zosyn were started for nosocomial pneumonia on that day) in addition to underlying pulmonary metastases and new mild pulmonary edema.
He was put on face mask ventilation but continued to have increased work of breathing and worsening respiratory status.
Repeat ABGs showed respiratory acidosis and failure with pH 7.09-7.14 pCO2 55-60 PO2 56-82 and HCO3 19-21.
Patient suspected to be in pneumosepsis, and became hypotensive and required pressor support with levophed and vasopressin.
Continuing hypotension required additional support with phenylephrine.
