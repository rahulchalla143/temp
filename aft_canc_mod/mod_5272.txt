Pt had been at [**Hospital1 **] for evaluation/tx of chest pain on [**2191-5-17**].
She had negative MIBI on [**5-18**], and later in her hospital stay developed worsening CP and was found to have pericardial effusion on echo.
She began to develop pericardial tamponade, resp failure, and hypotension with a question of adrenal hemorrhage, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management on [**2191-6-7**].
She also had an elevated WBC count to 79.8 with 99% neutrophils.
Since that time the pt has been followed by Psychiatry, receiving Valium and now Haldol, with improving mental status / decreasing agitation.
HD status has been improving, though with somewhat labile BPs.
Pulmonary status improving with reduced O2 requirements.

Her hospital course was notable for dementia.
CTA showed large pericardial efussion w/?adrenal hemorrhage.
PMH: MDS major depression personality do anxiety do Fe deficiency anemia sigmoid diverticulosis Duodenal lipoma .
At bl ambulates w/walker w/o assistance.
Smear- Elevated WBC consists mostly of segs and bands.
Rare metamyelocytes and atypical lymphocytes seen.
R subclav line at junction of SVC and R atria.
ECG: SR @ 108 w/diffuse ST elevations and PR depression in I c/w pericarditis.
No RVD collapse.
A/P: 69W w/MDS, hypotension, pericardial efussion, pleural efussions, and elevated WBC count with transverse colitis .
w/ pneumonia/atelectasis as likely precipitant.
Cont Zosyn/Flagyl for pneumonia .
Hypotension-resolved, due to  sepsis and tamponade, s/p pericardiocentesis with transient improvement.
(zosyn/flagyl) -keeps MAPs>60s, gently diurese (total body overloaded) -TTE: effusion stable .
HTN - pt.
Elevated WBC- acute leukemic process unlikely.
WBC elevation likely a leukemoid rxn [**3-10**] infection, likely cdiff.
w/ depression, ?
She also had an elevated WBC count to 79.8 with 99% neutrophils.
Since that time the pt has been followed by Psychiatry, receiving Valium and now Haldol, with improving mental status / decreasing agitation.
HD status has been improving, though with somewhat labile BPs.
Pulmonary status improving with reduced O2 requirements.
Mild fluctuations in Hct that has persistently on low side since transfer to medical floor.
Unclear source; did have pan-colitis on colonoscopy earlier in stay, no clinical sx and C diff neg x 3, awaiting C diff toxin B, on Flagyl.
GI was aware of case, did not feel need for intervention.
Pain in epigastrium [**6-15**], somewhat tender exam, non-surgical, with high amylase and lipase.
Pain/tenderness absent [**6-16**] after being NPO/IVF/d/c Flagyl.
Now with no pain, no tenderness on exam.
Presumed leukomoid / septic reaction.
Increase on [**6-19**] possibly [**3-10**] C diff since switched off Flagyl to Vanco for pancreatitis.
Tachycardic intermittently, with one 'trigger' event of tachycardia to 160, pt felt a chest flutter, no chest pain or pressure, resolved with already-scheduled Metoprolol dose.
CXR [**6-15**] w/ continued mild/moderate pulmonary edema / effusions, no focal process.
On Lasix for several days to diurese, currently with much reduced crackles on exam, off Lasix.
Improved O2 requirement since admission.
No residual tamponade/effusion physiology since transfer to the medical floor.
With mild b/l upper extremity weakness, mild RF elevation, consider outpatient Rheum evaluation .
With diarrhea and guaiac positive stool originally, colonoscopy showed ascending, transverse, and descending colon involvement with sigmoid sparing.
Presumed infectious vs. ischemic etiologies most likely, with recent antibiotic use but also recent hypotensive episodes.
Mental status.
Pt has an unclear history of some baseline dementia.
In the ICU, the patient became agitated with delirium requiring Haldol, restraints, and a sitter.
A head CT showed a non-acute left basal ganglia lacune and probable older multi-infarct/ischemia-related changes, no acute bleed or change seen to explain delirium.
Likely sepsis-related delirium.
Neurology commented that delirium should improve daily, and noted unrelated mild b/l upper extremity weakness, and said to consider cervical MRI at some point if further workup of the UE weakness was indicated.
Pt's diet was switched to IVF / NPO for 2-3 days during her pancreatic enzyme elevation and abdominal pain/tenderness, then advanced to sips to clears and currently to full liquids on discharge, with pancreatic enzymes trending down and no clinical signs of pancreatitis.
Pt pulled out central line on [**6-20**], no complications, has peripheral IV .
Morphine 2 mg/mL Syringe Sig: One (1)  Injection Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for abdominal pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 3145**] Nursing Home - [**Location (un) 3146**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Pericardial tamponade Coronary artery disease Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Myelodysplastic syndrome Sigmoid diverticulosis Colitis Anemia Pancreatitis Respiratory failure Dementia Major depression   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Discharge Instructions: Please go to the Emergency Department if you experience chest pain, persistent racing heartbeat, chest flutter, shortness of breath, new confusion, new weakness, slurred speech, blurry vision, bloody stools, severe abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, or any other concerning symptom.
You have come to [**Hospital1 18**] and had fluid drained from around your heart, with breathing problems and a probable infection that have been gradually resolving.
Also please discuss with your primary care doctor the possibility of seeing a rheumatologist for your upper extremity bilateral weakness in the context of your recent hospital course.
