Admission Date:  [**2101-4-25**]       Discharge Date:  [**2101-5-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2024-3-16**]       Sex:  F  Service:  ACOVE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 77-year-old woman, with a past medical history significant for head and neck cancer (diagnosed in [**2091**], status post radical neck dissection and radiation treatment), recently seen on [**2101-4-14**] at [**Hospital3 **] for shortness of breath, hoarseness, and respiratory stridor.
She was scheduled for elective tracheostomy on [**2101-4-25**] after a CT chest on [**2101-4-21**] demonstrated a probable mass involving the larynx on the left.
She was also started on Unasyn for a question of aspiration pneumonia and prophylaxis?
Head and neck cancer diagnosed in [**2091**], status post radical neck dissection and radiation treatment.
There is extensive involvement of the left portion of the larynx and unilateral vocal cord paralysis on that side as a result.
CVA x 2.
COPD with PFTs and more details unknown.
Cholangitis in [**2095**].
Left carotid stenosis demonstrated on MRA and ultrasound.
Vertebral artery stenosis.
10.Peripheral vascular disease, status post femoral-popliteal bypass in [**2095**].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm, tachycardic, I/VI early systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border without S4 or S3, nondisplaced point of maximal impulse.
PULMONARY:  Hoarse voice and stridor on inspiration, fair air movement, clear to auscultation posteriorly in all lung fields.
EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema, palpable pulses at the radial arteries bilaterally.
Chest x-ray demonstrates consolidation of the left lower lobe, likely aspiration pneumonia, also with overinflation, flat diaphragms, consistent with emphysema.
EKG - sinus rhythm at 108 beats per minute, axis normal, QT segment mildly prolonged, specific number no[**Serial Number 29325**], poor R wave progression in V1 through V3, slight ST segment depressions of less than 1 mm in the inferior leads.
CT scan without contrast demonstrates probable mass involving the larynx in the left, low attenuation within the isthmus and left lobe of the thyroid gland, severe atherosclerotic disease with occlusion of the left internal carotid artery, and stenosis of the right internal carotid artery with mural thrombus within the proximal descending aorta, emphysema, tiny noncalcified nodule in the right lower lobe of the lung, multiple cysts within both kidneys which cannot fully be characterized on this study.
CT neck with IV contrast - low attention within the left and right lobes of the thyroid, slightly prominent, slight irregularity of the mucosa inferior to the anterior commissure on the left and the right posteriorly at the level of the false cords, unusual calcification in the right cricoid cartilage suggestive of prior injury.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit for management of her respiratory distress.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE - 1) AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION:  The ENT service was consulted and given the patient's declining oxygen saturation and extensive involvement of her squamous cell CA of the left pharynx, it was their impression that she would require placement of a tracheostomy tube.
Initially, she did have thick secretions requiring frequent suctioning.
There were conflicting impressions regarding the patient's prognosis of phonation.
There was definitely unilateral left-sided cord paralysis.
2) TUBERCULOSIS:  No acid-fast bacilli were seen on direct smear; however, on the concentrated smear there were rare AFB+ cells.
A genetic probe was sent to the [**State 350**] State Lab for further DNA analysis by direct probe.
PPD was placed and read as 5 mm which would be negative in this patient for whom a threshold of 10 mm was set, given her history of malignancy.
3) LEFT LOWER LOBE PNEUMONIA:  The patient was initially on Unasyn for left lower lobe pneumonia.
A BAL was performed on [**2101-4-26**], and the BAL demonstrated moderate growth of oropharyngeal flora, but coag-positive Staph aureus that was sensitive to oxacillin.
This should be continued for a 14-day course, given the patient's slight increase in progression on chest x-ray of [**2101-5-3**], and underlying risk factor for complicated pneumonia.
4) ?VALVULAR DISEASE:  The patient does have a murmur suggestive of either aortic stenosis or pulmonic stenosis (given the increase with inspiration).
5) ABDOMINAL PAIN:  Her abdominal pain was chronic and well controlled with liquid percocet, as well as DTO.
An abdominal ultrasound was performed which was negative for any evidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
We did speak with her surgeon who placed her G-tube, who states that abdominal pain has been a chronic issue for her.
The ostomy nurses were consulted and did change the stoma site.
However, it should be noted that it was the opinion of gastroenterology that the G-tube was in a very tenuous position and should be readdressed within the next 2 weeks.
6) HYPERTENSION:  The patient was somewhat hypertensive during her inpatient stay.
The right common carotid artery does have a mild stenosis.
9) FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  At this point, the patient is on tube feeds at goal.
Flush with 60 cc of water q 8 h.  Initially, there was some concern for drainage around the ostomy site.
10) GOALS OF CARE:  Given the patient's poor prognosis with her squamous cell CA of the neck that seems to have recurred since [**2091**], and limited possibility for additional therapeutic intervention, a discussion was conducted with the patient and her 2 sons, and it was decided that she would not want aggressive measures.
