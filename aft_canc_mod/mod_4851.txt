Per the outside report, he had progressive cough and voice changes over the past few months and reports trouble with both solids and liquids.
He has had weight loss of approximately 15-20 lbs during this time as well.
Biopsy of his left upper lung mass was consistent with small cell lung cancer in [**11-16**].
PET scan showed b/l subcarinal nodes but no more distant disease.
He was recently noted to have very bulky [**Location (un) 21851**] with LUL collapse and partial occlusion of the left pulmonary artery.
Patient presented for direct admit for stent placement but CT scan showed pericardial effusion and pulsus was reportedly measured on the floor to be 15-20.
Bedside echo showed RV collapse with signs of tamponade.
Transfer to CCU for monitoring with plan for pericardiocentesis in AM.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
[**2-16**] and [**3-18**]: RT done [**2-16**]: showed regression in most areas.
[**4-17**]: last chemo [**2180-6-1**]: PET showed reduction in all areas, no new areas.
CT scan noted for new infiltrate showing encasement of artery to LUL and subtotal occlusion of the bronchus to the LUL.
[**8-18**]: continued worsening of hoarseness, paroxysmal cough, left anterior chest dsicomfort, increased dyspnea, no other pain or headache, no addtional bleed.
CT: increasing central adenopathy, narrowing of left mainstem bronchus to [**12-11**] of the right bronchus, complete obliteration of the LUL bronchus with collapse of LUL with compromise of left pulmonary artery.
Started on: Etoposide and carboplatin - 2 cycles, progressive disease noted, has a pericardial effusion.
presented for paliative treatment.
Hyperlipidemia Pacemaker [**2169**] H/O Hep C untreated [**1-11**] IVDU 30 yrs ago spontaneous PTX cigarette addiction significant alcohol intake tendon repair 4th finger on the right hand  Social History: 2 Drinks daily, smoke [**12-11**] ppd or more till [**2-/2180**], started a nicotine patch.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: Diffuse expiratory rhonchi with decreased BS at L apex ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND.
No HSM or tenderness.
EXTREMITIES: Trace pitting edema b/l.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to large pericardial effusion located mostly at the LV apex and LV inferolateral wall.
There is relatively little fluid overlying the right ventricular free wall.
Apical approach to pericardiocentesis likely better.
No frank echo evidence of tamponade although both ventricles are small and patient is tachycardic.
Successful pericardiocentesis with 240 cc of serosanguinous fluid removed with access obtained under echocardiographic guidance and pericardial drainage bag secured and sutured into position.
Massive volume loss in the left lung due to fibrosis and consolidations.
Subsequent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
No pathological changes in the right lung.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Prior to tap, moderate to large circumferential pericardial effusion is seen.
Post-tap, there is minimal fluid with normal biventricular function.
Brief Hospital Course: 65yo M with metastatic SCLC admitted for tracheal stent placement, found to have pericardial effusion with concern for early tamponade physiology on TTE, hemodynamically stable now.
# Pericardial effusion: He presented with reported shortness of breath.
He had questionable tamponade physiology on echo.
A post procedure echo showed minimal effusion, and echo the following day ([**12-1**]) showed minimal increase from post procedure, after minimal output from the drain.
# Small Cell Lung CA: He is undergoing palliative measures as an outpatient.
They did not observe there to be any purulence posterior to the obstruction, however there was extensive invasion and necrosis from tumor, including into the [**Female First Name (un) 5309**].
He was very sedated after the procedure, and required intubation overnight, for airway protection post procedurally.
There were minimal secretions suctioned the morning after the procedure.
# Transaminitis: [**Month (only) 116**] be [**1-11**] chronic untreated HCV infection given concomitant elevated INR and low albumin.
Also possibly a component of alcoholic cirrhosis/hepatitis, though AST not significantly more elevated than ALT.
Metastatic disease also on the differential.
# Leukocytosis: WBC elevated with left shift.
Treatment was started with Levaquin for postobstructive pneumonia.
# Follow-up: Mr. [**Known lastname 88214**] has a few pending labs that will need to be followed-up by his primary care physician or [**Name9 (PRE) 269**] service and faxed to his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 64198**]:  Blood cultures - no growth to date Respiratory culture - no growth to date Broncoalveolar lavage fluid cultures - no growth to date  Medications on Admission: Megace ES 625mg prn Atenolol 25mg QD aspirin 325 prn mucinex 600mg prn guaiatussin AC 20-200 prn  Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: angels visiting nurse  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Left main bronchus obstruction Small cell lung cancer Pericardial effusion  Secondary: HLD Alcoholism Hepatitis C   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
On admission you were found to have fluid surrounding your heart, which was causing mild shortness of breath.
