Admission Date:  [**2160-2-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2160-2-26**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, seizure disorder, who presented at the [**Hospital3 537**] with hypoxia and respiratory distress.
The patient had recently been admitted to the [**Hospital6 14430**] from [**2-5**] to [**2-14**] with respiratory distress requiring intubation.
She was treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation with steroids, antibiotics including Vancomycin and Cefepime for pneumonia, and was extubated after two or three days.
The patient was also treated for hypertensive urgency requiring transient Labetalol drip.
She was having low-grade fevers on her steroid taper, and she had a loculated right pleural effusion for which the patient had refused thoracentesis.
On [**2160-2-16**], the patient was found by the family at the [**Hospital3 537**] to have increased respiratory rate and looked purplish in her extremities.
The patient had a blood pressure of 176/44, pulse 110, and oxygen saturation of 70% on nonrebreather and was intubated for respiratory distress with subsequent hypotension after induction.
The patient had a chest x-ray after intubation which showed prominent right hilar area concerning for vascular abnormality.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed in the Emergency Room which revealed no evidence of dissection, normal right ventricular size and function, no acute changes consistent with PE, and normal ejection fraction greater than 55%.
The patient also had left ventricular hypertrophy with a small left ventricle.
In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was initially hypotensive to the 90s/50s and was given another liter of normal saline with mild response.
There was extrinsic narrowing of the right lower lobe superior segment bronchus.
The patient also had a deep venous thrombosis detected by lower extremity ultrasound and was started on a Heparin drip.
She continued to have difficult elevated blood pressures requiring Hydralazine IV.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease reported mild.
Hypertension with a recent urgency at [**Hospital6 **].
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Chronic back pain on MS Contin 120 mg p.o.
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
General:  The patient was intubated, sedated and paralyzed.
Extremities:  No edema.
Cyanotic upper extremities.
Chronic venostasis changes at shins anteriorly.
LABORATORY DATA:  At the time of admission, white blood cell count 35.3, hematocrit 41.5, MCV 86, RDW 14, differential with neutrophils of 96%, bands 3%, atypicals 1%, platelet count 395; PT 13.5, PTT 25.4, INR 1.2; urinalysis yellow, cloudy, specific gravity of 1.025, large blood, negative nitrite, 30 protein, no glucose or ketones, small leukocyte esterase, greater than 50 red blood cells, greater than 50 white blood cells, few bacteria, few yeast, 21-50 squamous epithelial cells; glucose 236; sodium 129, potassium 4.3, chloride 97, bicarb 20, BUN 43, creatinine 2.1; CK 139, CKMB 6, troponin less than 0.3; albumin 3.5, calcium 6.9, phosphorus 8.1, magnesium 2.4; Dilantin 2.1; initial arterial blood gas while intubated with a pH of 7.27, pCO2 49, pO2 221 on 100% FI02; lactate 2.1, free calcium 1.04.
To summarize, the patient had acute shortness of breath with chest pain and anxiety at her rehabilitation facility after being discharged from the [**Hospital6 **] on p.o.
Levofloxacin after having a loculated pleural effusion and pneumonia requiring intubation.
In the Emergency Department, she was hypotensive and hypoxic requiring intubation.
She received a significant amount of volume resuscitation.
The patient's chest x-ray showed question of wide mediastinum but no evidence of PE or dissection by transesophageal echocardiogram.
Other issues included hyponatremia, acute renal failure with a creatinine of 2.1 which has since resolved.
The patient was also treated with Bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis.
The patient was treated with Heparin drip for deep venous thrombosis.
The patient had bronchoscopy with brushings and biopsy on [**2-18**] and was extubated on [**2-19**].
The patient also had labile hypertension controlled with intravenous antihypertensives.
The patient had anemia which was treated with 1 U of packed red blood cells.
The patient had bronchial brushings which showed rare atypical cells and reactive bronchial cells and acute inflammation.
She also had bronchial washings which were positive for malignant cells consistent with non-small cell carcinoma with features suggestive of squamous differentiation.
The patient was with a chest CT revealing a 6.2 x 5.4 cm low attenuation lesion in the superior segment of the right lower lobe of the lung.
The patient had a large 3.5 cm low density lesion within the liver with peripheral enhancement, likely metastatic disease.
The patient also has a well circumscribed small right adrenal lesion and apparently enhancing nodule with an area of ascites anterior to the liver.
These findings were all consistent with the diagnosis of metastatic lung cancer.
The patient also had head CT which did not reveal any evidence of metastatic lesions; however, study was suboptimal to detect these lesions, as it was done for other purposes.
Her comorbidities would make it difficult for her to tolerate chemotherapy or radiation.
The decision regarding role of palliative radiation therapy in this patient with a history of chronic low back pain requiring high doses of MS Contin for over 10-20 years, make it less likely that palliative radiation therapy would be of any benefit.
Question stroke:  The patient had supratherapeutic PTT and hematocrit drop, as well as questionable left-sided weakness and had head CT on [**2-22**] which was negative for evidence of acute bleed.
The patient also had full return of her neurological status without any focal neurological deficits.
Hypertension:  The patient had hypertension that was difficult to control and required intravenous medications, initially Hydralazine; however, the patient was gradually changed over to a p.o.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable, but the patient is definitely below her baseline function and mental status.
Deep venous thrombosis.
Metastatic lung cancer.
