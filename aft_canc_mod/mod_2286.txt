In general, he was a pleasant and chronically ill-appearing male.
Chest examination revealed left-sided crackles one half of the way up.
There were prominent expiratory wheezes.
The left ventricle was moderately dilated with severe right ventricular hypokinesis.
His troponin levels trended down, and the elevated troponin levels were felt to be due to a demand ischemia from hypotension.
Given the large right pleural effusion, a computerized axial tomography of the chest was performed which showed a large right-sided loculated pleural effusion.
Status post extubation, he had frequent episodes of mucous plugging especially at night where he would have significant desaturations.
In addition, a swallow study was performed which showed that he had significant aspiration problems and was not safe to take anything by mouth.
A computed tomography scan of the chest showed that he had a large right-sided intraparenchymal lung abscess.
