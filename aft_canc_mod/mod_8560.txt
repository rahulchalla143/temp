Admission Date:  [**2120-1-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-2-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2045-4-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization Abdominal fat pad biopsy   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 74 y/o M with PMHx significant for HTN, COPD, dCHF (last EF 55% with LVH), who was initially admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service earlier this evening for shortness of breath and leg swelling.
On presentation, he complained of worsening DOE over the past few weeks, with associated PND and orthopnea.
He also was experiencing bilateral leg and scrotal swelling.
He triggered for hypotension in the ED and was given 1 L NS, with improvement of his BP.
ECG in the ED was noted to [**Location (un) 381**] voltage, poor R wave progression, TWI in V5-V6; CXR showed BL pleural effusions.
Labs in the ED showed an elevated creatinine to 2.2 from a baseline of 1.9, an elevated BNP, and a troponin of 0.24 with negative CK.
On admission, it was thought that the patient's symptoms represented an exacerbation of his underlying heart failure.
He was noted to have a pulsus of 5 and low voltage on ECG.
The cardiology fellow was called out of concern for potential tamponade.
He complained of nausea and had some episodes of dry heaves.
He did complain of chest discomfort during these episodes.
He denied any shortness of breath.
Emergent bedside echo revealed moderate LVH, normal LV function, mild RVH and mild depressed/borderline RV function.
On further questioning, the patient denied any recent fevers, chills, night sweats, or recent illnesses.
He admitted to a chronic cough productive of clear sputum but denied any recent changes in this.
He did complain of a "tiredness" in his neck today.

Atelectasis in the lung bases is stable, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Biventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional systolic function.
Mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
Bilateral renal cysts.
Incomplete evaluation of renal vasculature.
ECHO ([**2120-1-29**]) - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There is a large left pleural effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-28**], moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased PCWP are now identified.
A large left pleural effusion is also now seen.
Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Elevated cardiac output/index on and off of levophed.
This may represent a dilated loop of small or large bowel, or even be related to the cecum.
A cecal volvus is not entirely excluded.
Please clinically correlate with patient's symptoms and a CT can be obtained.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Consolidation at the left lung base is not fully evaluated on this abdominal radiograph.
Diagnostic considerations include atelectasis versus airspace disease.
Soft tissue (abdominal wall fat), biopsy: Adipose tissue with features consistent with amyloid deposition.
However, no safe detection of osteolytic lesion that would affect the cortex.
No evidence of vertebral compression.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 y/o M with history of HTN, COPD, dCHF (last EF 55% with LVH), admitted with suspected CHF exacerbation, found to be hypotensive shortly after admission and transferred to the CCU.
# Hypotension / Heart Failure: Pt presented with symptoms concerning for heart failure exacerbation.
Echo on presentation showed biventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional systolic function.
However, ECG showed low voltage.
This was concerning for an infiltrative process in the myocardium, in particular amyloidosis.
Ultimately, it was felt that the patient's hypotension was due to autonomic dysfunction in the setting of amyloidosis.
Eventually, the patient underwent a fat pad biopsy, which was positive for amyloidosis.
He was also recommended to f/u with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as an outpatient for managment of his presumed cardiac amyloidosis.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine on admission was 2.2 with a recent baseline of 1.9.
[**Hospital 8351**] medical record review reveals worsening of the patient's renal fxn over the past few months.
It was felt that the patient's renal failure was likely related to amyloidosis.
The patient was initially diuresed; however, he eventually had decreasing urine output.
He was followed by renal, who ultimately felt that he was developing an ATN-type picture.
This was likely related to his hypotension and poor blood flow to his kidneys.
# LE Edema: Was felt to be related to hypoabuminemia as well as right-sided heart failure.
# Microcytic Anemia: Recent iron studies in [**2119-12-25**], show evidence of iron deficiency anemia.
# Hypertension: Antihypertensives held [**12-26**] hypotension as above.
# Elevated LFT's: Pt noted to have an elevated alkaline phosphatase.

A biopsy of the fat pad from your belly showed that you did indeed have amyloidosis.
There is a possibility that you have amyloidosis because you have an underlying malignancy.
