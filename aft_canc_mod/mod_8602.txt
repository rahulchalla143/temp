Postoperatively, on [**2175-9-4**], a CT scan demonstrated no evidence of metastatic disease, as did CT scans on [**9-10**] and [**1-9**], [**2175**].
However, a followup CT scan on [**2176-4-1**] demonstrated a new 5- mm hypodensity that appeared to be in segment V of the liver, too small to definitively characterize, but suspicious for a metastatic lesion.
On [**2176-4-3**] she developed a recurrent small-bowel obstruction and was taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions for small-bowel obstruction, and repair of a perineal hernia with DualMesh.
She also developed a recurrent small-bowel obstruction and on [**2176-5-17**] was taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy, extensive lysis of adhesions, removal of pelvic DualMesh, small- bowel resection, and placement of drains and a pain pump.
A CT scan on [**2176-6-2**] demonstrated no change in the liver lesion.
The pelvic CT demonstrated no change in the presacral soft tissue density and areas of low density within the pelvis, some of which were thought to represent simple adnexal structures.
There were no signs of small-bowel obstruction.
The enlarging mass was consistent with metastatic carcinoma and appeared to be resectable.

Pathology revealed metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (2.7 cm), moderately differentiated and consistent with metastasis from the anal canal squamous cell carcinoma.
Within the non-neoplastic liver specimen, mild portal chronic inflammation, minimal portal fibrosis (trichrome stain) and no stainable iron (iron stain) were documented.
On POD#1, liver function tests were elevated (ALT=4282,AST=4295,AlkPhos=150,TBili=0.9), and thus a liver ultrasound was obtained and labs were repeated.
Ultrasound revealed patent hepatic and portal veins, with appropriate waveforms, yet decreased resistive indices in the main hepatic artery and no definite intraparenchymal hepatic arterial flow.
She was subsequently referred for angiography and percutaneous intervention.
She was transferred to the SICU following thrombolysis and a CT pelvis w/contrast and CTA abdomen w/and w/o contrast were obtained to evaluate hepatic vessels and possible contrast extravasation from the angioplasty.
Findings revealed: small pseudoaneurysm at the common hepatic artery origin just distal to the take off the GDA, luminal narrowing of the common and right hepatic artery origin consistent with stenosis, patent intrahepatic right hepatic artery distal to aforementioned area, no active extravasation of contrast, possible small focal dissection involving the proximal GDA, patent intrahepatic left hepatic artery, perfusion abnormalities consistent with infarction involving segments VII and V with the branch of right hepatic artery supplying these areas extending to the resection margin, marked gallbladder luminal distension and wall edema, and small bilateral effusions, right greater than left, with adjacent compression atelectasis.
She was initially placed on vicodin due to percocet allergy, but then changed to po dilaudid due to complaints of nausea despite zofran and compazine.
On the evening of POD #5, the patient sustained a mechanical fall after attempting to get out of bed.
She fell on her buttocks, no trauma sustained.
The following morning, she received another dose of IV ativan (1mg) and again, became increasing somnolent, confused, and incontinent.
On POD #6 and #7, Fleet's enema per stoma was administered due to no stool output x3 days; this resulted in fecal output (pasty brown stool) and a softer abdomen.
On POD#7, CT abdomen - triphasic with arterial reconstruction was obtained as followup to initial CT on [**2176-8-10**].
Findings revealed: persistent hypoperfused areas in the right lobe of the liver, appearance of gallbladder rupture/necrosis, patent portal and splenic veins, focal stenosis of the common hepatic artery, and an interval increase in size of the GDA aneurysm.
She tolerated the procedure well with no complications and was taken back to the floor post-operatively.
She received Toradol and Dilaudid IV for pain control, in addition to ativan po prn.
