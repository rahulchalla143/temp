Admission Date:  [**2131-10-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-10-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2060-3-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Procardia / Aliskiren  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath and headache.
History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname 95455**] [**Known lastname 95456**] is a 71-year-old right-handed man with DM, CAD s/p IMI, chronic diastolic CHF, malignant hypertension, and recent diagnosis of right frontotemporal GBM, s/p biopsy on [**2131-9-18**] who presented to the [**Hospital6 33**] ED from rehabilitation after complaining of SOB and headache.
He then received [**2-17**] ampule of D50 for hypoglycemia in 50s.
A head CT showed heterogenous frontotemporal mass with partial effacement of right lateral ventricle with surrounding vasogenic edema but no midline shift, and intratumoral hemorrhage could not be excluded.
He also received vecuronium 10 mg IV x 2, etomidate 20 mg IV, and succhinylcholine 100 mg IV, and intubated for respiratory failure attributed to acute CHF based on chest X-ray.
Chest X-ray showed ETT 4.6 cm above carina, near complete opacification of the left hemithorax with a large left effusion and compressive atelectasis, and bilateral pulmonary edema.
Another head CT showed stable appearance to right temporoparietal lobe with edema and mass effect but no shift, and stable foci of hemorrhage.
Past Medical History: -R frontotemporal GBM WHO Grade IV s/p biopsy [**2131-9-27**], plan to start protocol using hypofractionated involved-field XRT with temozolomide and Cyberknife boost -Malignant HTN -CAD s/p IMI -Chronic diastolic CHF -PAF (ED visit [**7-25**]) -DM -Anxiety  Social History: Resident of [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 4542**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 19207**] & Nursing Center in [**Location (un) 38**], MA.

HEENT: Mucous membranes moist, no lesions noted CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**] PULMONARY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales or rhonchi.
EXTREMITIES: 2+ pitting edema to knee bilaterally, 2+ Dorsalis pedis and radial pulses bilaterally.
1+ pitting edema in hands bilaterally, no cyanosis or erythema.
He has a left lower facial droop.
Motor Examination:  He has a drift in the left upper extremity.
While these findings may reflect chronic infarct, a mass lesion with surrounding edema is more concerning.
There is local mass effect but no herniation.
No evidence for acute hemorrhage.
Extensive nasal passage and sinus opacification compatible with intubated status.
Diffuse non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.
Chest AP portablem on admission: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-13**], there is continued pulmonary vascular congestion with bilateral effusions and compressive atelectasis.
Again, the possibility of supervening pneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
Normal-appearing kidneys, with no evidence of stone or hydronephrosis.
Normal arterial and venous waveforms with resistive indices ranging from 0.71-0.75, within normal limits.
Chest X-Ray [**2131-10-15**]: IMPRESSION: Improving aeration with small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis, improved since the priors.
Port placement [**2131-10-16**]: IMPRESSION: Successful placement of double-lumen chest Power Port-A-Cath via right internal jugular venous access.
Upper Extremity ultrasound [**2131-10-16**]: IMPRESSION: No DVT in the left upper extremity.

(1) Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure:  Chest X-ray findings are consistent with decompensated CHF likely precipitated by hypertensive urgency/emergency (SBP was documented at 240 mmHg at OSH); could also consider parapneumonic effusion with ARDS.
Hypertension was controlled with beta blockade, [**Last Name (un) **].
Patient had episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, was not hemodynamically unstable.
Patient likely has component of tachy-brady syndrome.
Overlying pneumonia could not be excluded based on chest film, and broad spectrum antibiotics were continued for 48 hours, later discontinued after sputum results returned.
Hemodynamics improved, and he was extubated on [**2131-10-14**] without complication.
Patient was continued on Lasix while admitted to prevent against respiratory symptoms and to improve edema, which was significant in the upper and lower extremities.
(2) Postoperative Cerebral Edema and Mass Effect:  There was no midline shift by CT.  Neurosurgery was consulted and did not recommend surgical intervention.
Following extubation and continued improvement in patient's hemodynamics, transfer was arranged to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] for continued management of glioblastoma multiforme.
(3) Glioblastoma Multiforme:  The patient had a portcath placed on [**2131-10-16**] and began radiation treatment on [**2131-10-17**] without incident.
He also began chemotherapy, consistent of temodar on [**2131-10-16**], and continued up until the time of discharge without problems.
(4) Hypertension:  The patient had numerous episodes of hypertensive urgency during the admission, many times with SBP>190.
There was some concern for renal artery stenosis given dramatic hyerptension.
There was some discussion about an angiogram to rule out renal artery stenosis, but this was not done due to recent elevation in Cr to 1.3 with initiation of Lasix.
(5) Chronic Diastolic CHF:  Patient was placed on Lasix during admission for edematous symptoms and to prevent respiratory symptoms.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 4542**] Rehabilitation and Nursing of [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary dianosis: Hypoxemic respiratory failure Postoperative cerebral edema and mass effect Hypertensive urgency  Secondary diagnosis: Right frontotemporal glioblastoma multiforme Malignant hypertension Coronary artery disease Chronic diastolic congestive heart failure Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation Diabetes mellitus Anxiety  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You came for further evaluation of shortness of breath.
Further evaluation showed that you had an episode of decompensated heart failure most likely due to greatly increased blood pressure.
While you were here we adjusted your heart failure and blood pressure medications to more optimally manage these problems.
