Also had increased O2 requirement.
Past Medical History: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation- not on AC [**12-28**] fall history Diastolic heart dysfunction Hypothyroidism Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] h/o Subdural hematoma Myeloproliferative disease  Social History: lives at an independent living facility, smoked 2ppd x 50y, but quit over 20y ago, denies EtOH and drug use  Family History: Father died of MI no lung problems in the family   Physical Exam: vitals- T98.5, BP 141/71, HR 79, RR 20, O2sat 93% on 50%FM General- elderly woman sitting up in bed, FM in place, NAD HEENT- sclerae anicteric and noninjected, dry MM Neck- supple, no JVD, carotid bruit vs. radiation of murmur Lungs- + crackles 1/3 up R and 1/2 up L Heart- RRR, [**2-29**] HSM heard best at apex, 3/6 SEM heard best at RUSB with ?radiation to carotids Abd- hypoactive bowel sounds, soft; RLQ mass (10x8cm), mobile, nonpulsatile, with assoc.
Fat stranding and inflammatory change in the right lower quadrant in the region of the cecum without evidence of free intraperitoneal air or abscess.
Differential diagnosis for this finding includes acute appendicitis, diverticulitis and less likely colitis.
Distended gallbladder containing sludge without evidence of wall thickening to suggest acute cholecystitis.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
Prominent pancreatic duct without evidence of pancreatic mass or calculi.
Mild CHF with cardiomegaly.
Increase in left retrocardiac opacity which may represent effusion and atelectasis; an underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Slight increase in pulmonary edema at right lung base.
TTE ([**8-29**]): EF>55%, [**11-27**]+ MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 34486**] jet  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: [**Age over 90 **]yo F with h/o PAF, hypothyroidism, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], myeloproliferative disease, and diastolic dysfunction, who was admitted to Surgery for abdominal pain thought [**12-28**] diverticulitis vs. colitis, now being transferred to Medicine for management of AF/RVR, CHF, and possible pneumonia.
# Abdominal pain:  She was admitted with a diagnosis of diverticulitis vs. colitis.
Her abdominal pain improved gradually and she had only some residual tenderness on the day of transfer to the MICU.
The amiodarone drip was discontinued on [**1-28**], and she was started on an oral loading dose of amiodarone, and was also kept on her beta blocker.
She converted to atrial fibrillation and had rates to 140s, but was maintaining her blood pressure and O2 saturation.
She again went into AF with RVR, but was having hypotension and poor oxygenation this time.
Volume overloaded on exam, increased O2 requirement, likely secondary to IVF administration during treatment for diverticulitis.
Had to be put on NRB in setting of fluids for hypotension when she went into RVR on [**1-29**].
Could be [**12-28**] acute pulmonary edema as a result of her diastolic dysfunction in the setting of atrial fibrillation.
# Myeloproliferative disease: Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
# Hypothyroidism: - continue levothyroxine at outpatient dose MICU Course:  Patient was admitted to the floor given hypotension, hypoxia and afib with RVR on the floor.
However over the next several days she continued to have episodes of RVR with HR upto 120s.
