The lungs demonstrate no confluent areas of consolidation or effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of CHF or pneumonia.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the  mitral valve.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is  no pericardial effusion.
[**2136-8-6**]: CXR CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: Patchy infiltrates are present in the left lower lobe and the right lower lobe consistent with bilateral basal pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: Pneumonia in the right and left lower lobe.
[**2136-8-7**]:CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There are small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
There is a small amount of pericardial fluid.
There are enlarged lymph nodes within the axillae bilaterally.
Some have fatty centers, but at least one left axillary lymph node measures 13 mm in short axis dimension.
There are numerous small lymph nodes within the mediastinum and hila as well.
There are several nodular opacities particularly within the left upper lobe posteriorly.
There is dependent atelectasis at the lung bases, related to bilateral pleural effusions.
There may be some edema of the gallbladder, and there are several dependent areas of free fluid within the abdomen, which may be related to third spacing.
Within the spleen, there is a 23-mm hypodense lesion that is incompletely characterized on this exam.
There is free fluid in the paracolic gutters.
There is air within the bladder, which may be related to instrumentation, but correlation with urinalysis is requested.
There is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.
There are enlarged inguinal nodes bilaterally.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions.
Several nodular opacities in the posterior portion of the left upper lobe, which may be infectious in the etiology.
Approximately 2-cm rounded hypodense lesion within the spleen, of undetermined etiology.
The finding may represent an infectious focus or an abscess, but a benign process such as hemangioma is also in the differential diagnosis.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, pericardial fluid, and small amount of free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis .
There is continued left lower lobe collapse/consolidation and small bilateral effusions.
[**2136-8-14**]: CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: Multiple small adjacent nodules in the left upper lobe are slightly decreased in size in the interval.
Two less than 5 mm non-calcified nodules in the right upper lobe are unchanged.
In addition, a single nodule in the left lower lobe, non-calcified and approximately 5 mm is unchanged as well.
There is probable minor fluid in the right minor fissure.
There are bilateral small pleural effusions, slightly smaller on the right and unchanged on the left.
Multiple small axillary lymph nodes are again noted and unchanged.
Several small but non-enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, and several right hilar lymph nodes, some of which are coarsely calcified are again appreciated and unchanged.
Dependent opacities are noted at the lung bases posteriorly, likely secondary to compressive effect from effusions and dependent positioning.
Bone windows show no suspicious lesions.
A focal area of irregular hypodensity in the spleen is unchanged.
IMPRESSION:  Slight interval improvement in clustered left upper lobe nodules and stable appearance to other nodules, likely indicative of an infectious etiology responding to interval treatment.
Additional possibilities in the abscence of antibiotic therapy would include vasculitis, nonbacterial infection (fungal or mycobacteria), or, less likely, a lymphoproliferative process .
[**2136-8-19**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**8-9**] and [**8-10**]:  Pulmonary edema improved substantially between [**8-9**] and 9th.
Bibasilar opacification concerning for bilateral pneumonia has not cleared subsequently and there is still small volume of pleural effusion bilaterally.

[**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 12033**]/jip  DIAGNOSIS:  Skin, left arm, punch biopsy:  Superficial perivascular mixed lympho-histiocytic, eosinophilic, and neutrophilic infiltrate with rare plasma cells, upper dermal edema and spongiosis .
[**2136-8-7**]: Skin, left medial thigh, punch biopsy:  Superficial and deep dermal perivascular eosinophil-[**Doctor First Name **] infiltrate with admixed neutrophils and occasional lymphocytes, upper dermal edema and spongiosis .
Brief Hospital Course: cc:[**CC Contact Info 63039**]* HPI: Pt is a 38 yo man w/ recent treatment of syphilis and no other sig PMH who presented on [**2136-8-2**] to general medical service w/ fevers to 103, malaise, BUE, BLE, buttock rash with no palmar/sole involvement.
Also compained of copious diarrhea but no weight loss and "food not passing through his stomach" for several months with occasional emesis.
* Since admission, patient was thought to likely have HIV w/ possible acute seroconversion, given multiple, unprotected sexual contacts.
Superinfection w/ syphilis, viral exanthem, and ricketsial disease were also entertained.
He has multiple serologies pending, cultures w/o growth, and his rash was biopsied but did not show evidence for syphilis.
He has been clincally stable, with ongoing mild hypotension (unsure what his baseline bp's are) and sinus tachycardia.
* Floor team called [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] team with concern for sespis, given persistent low grade temp, ongoing tachy/low bp as well as rising wbc to 19.7 w/ 21% bands and concern for sepsis.
He remained hemodynamically stable until this evening when he became hypotensive to 78/50, HR 120's-130's.
Also of note, DIC panel was also sent and heme service called today, given droppping platelets over last days (today = 45).
His ID course during this hospitalization was intense given persistently elevated temperatures despite multiple antibiotics, night sweats, rash, diarrhea, an eosinophilia and BPs in the 90s-100s.
He was also found to have an HBV VL of [**Numeric Identifier **] in his blood stream and thrush via an EGD.
Multiple other blood, urine and stool cultures were negative.
A large array of viral serologies were also negative.
The cecal biopsy and the multiple stool cultures were sent because of the patient's copious diarrhea during this admission.
By the time of his discharge, his diarrhea had decreased in quantity and frequency and his fevers decreased to low grade and he was afebrile [**Company 5249**] of 98.7 upon discharge.
Has h/o syphilis and treatment.
Felt to be due to HIV seroconversion.
HOwever, no other reasons for thrombocytopenia were found.
Newly diagnosed HBV 3. rash of unknown etiology 4. diarrhea of unknown etiology 5. fevers from unknown source   Discharge Condition: 1.
Patient ambulating; edema markedly improved; rash has resolved.
Please call Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 63040**] in the event that your rash returns.
