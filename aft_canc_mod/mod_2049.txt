Admission Date:  [**2106-12-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-1-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2030-10-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1148**] Chief Complaint: Sepsis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 76 yo M with hx of CAD (s/p CABG), Dementia, CHF, MRSA UTI presents from OSH with fever, lethargy, increased WBC and hypotension.
He was febrile at NH to 102.9, diagnosed with a UTI and pneumonia.
Pt recently admitted to OSH on [**11-6**] for similar sx which resolved with IVF and abx (CTX, Vanc, Flagyl).
Pt then decompensated today with either aspiration event or UTI and had increased HR and hypotension, O2 sat stable.
Found to have R renal mass on CT with necrosis and bleeding at OSH.
It appears embolization was considered but deferred given the hematuria and felt he would not tolerate procedure.
He was also given diltiazem 10 IVx2 for HR 120s with no response, vancomycin and zosyn and flagyl.
Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: 96.2, 103/61, 150->101, 24, 100% 2L GENL: chronically ill appearing, noncommunative, mild tremors in L arm HEENT: JVP at about 8 cm, OP dry, PERL CV: RRR no MRG Lungs: decreased BS at R base, no crackles Abd: soft, ?tenderness, no masses, +PEG Back: 2cm x 2cm stage 2-3 sacral ulcer Ext: no edema   Pertinent Results: urine: +[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] sacral debub wound: +[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] .
CT OF ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are bilateral moderate pleural effusions and associated dependent atelectasis of lung bases.
There is a 7 x 7 cm mass arising from the lower pole of the right kidney that has a necrotic mass within it.
This mass is enhancing peripherally and is associated with few retroperitoneal collaterals.
There are multiple large necrotic lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum near right renal vain measuring up to 23 x23 mm.
Right renal vein has heterogenous appearance and cannot be well assesed due to phase of the study.
The left kidney, left adrenal gland, right adrenal gland, liver, pancreas, the loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable.
No free air or f luid is seen within the abdomen.
The prostate gland has areas of calcification within it and looks enlarged.
No free air or free fluid is seen within the pelvic cavity.
No pathologically enlarged inguinal or pelvic lymph node is detected.
BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesion is seen.
Again noted is severe degenerative changes of thoracic and lumbar spine.
TTE: IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, consistent with CAD.
Severe mitral regurgitation.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 yo M with h/o CAD s/p CABG, dememtia, CHF who presents with sepsis.
# Sepsis/Infection: Likely due to pneumonia and a UTI.
He initially required pressors for support and was covered empirically with broad spectrum antibiotics.
He was also started on stress dosed steroids for a poor response to cortrysn stimulation.
For his urinary tract infection (vancomycin resistant enterococcus), his chronic indwelling foley (present x approximately one month prior to admission; he is s/p curative laser treatment for his history of obstructive BPH) was discontinued and he was treated with linezolid.
The patient continued to have an elevated WBC of unclear etiology.
He was c diff negative for multiple samples.
# CHF: ECHO showed EF 45% with severe MR resulting in moderate pulmonary hypertension.
# Anemia:  Labs suggest anemia of chronic disease but given guaic positive stools and history of hematuria, also concerned for possible acute blood loss.
He has advanced dementia and was continued on aricept and namenda.
# CAD: His ASA was held given guaic positive stool and history of hematuria.
# Hypernatremia:  Sodium elevated to low 150s following 7+L NS fluid resuscitation.
# ARF:  Creatinine on admission was elevated to 1.7 in the setting of dehydration and poor perfusion in setting of sepsis.
Creatinine improved with treatment of sepsis and IVFs.
Despite his age and h/o CHF, he is a poor candidate for anticoagulation and has had bleeding from right sided necrotic renal mass.
# Sacral decubitus ulcer: Stage 3.
# Renal mass: Seen on imaging at OSH with ?renal cell.
He had hct drop at OSH without clear source so there was some question as to whether he had bled into this necrotic mass.
Repeat scan here again revealed enlarged necrotic mass on R side with necrotic lymph nodes.
Patient also continued to have intermittent hematuria with some clots, believed to be from kidney mass.
Reviewed with family who are aware of the suspicion or renal cell CA and do not want further work up (ie surgery).
Free water flushes were started in the setting of his free water deficit and hypernatremia and should be continued.
[**Name (NI) **] remained very sick and minimally responsive through hospital stay.
He also had episodes lower blood pressure.
After prolonged hospital stay, h/o dementia and now likely renal cell carcinoma, family (wife, son, daughter) have made the goals of his care to be comfort.
No more blood draws.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Healthcare Center - [**Location (un) 1110**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Sepsis [**Location (un) **] urinary tract infection Aspiration pneumonia GIB anemia secondary to blood loss hematuria renal cell carcinoma (likely) with necrotic mass and necrotizing lymph nodes   Discharge Condition: Poor   Discharge Instructions: Goal of care for patient is comfort measures only.
He is not to have further blood draws or IVs started.
