Labs sent and hct 31.4 -> no need for transfusion.
EKG found to have ST depressions/TWI in inferior & anterolateral leads -> question of NSTEMI.

having couging fit and given total of 40mg oxycontin for pain (greater that his usual dose).
He then had an episode of desaturation to 88% per nursing notes.

ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Presented in [**7-28**] with lytic lesion in the ischium, found to have renal cell carcinoma, clear cell subtype.
He has pulmonary as well as progressive skeletal metastases involving multiple sites with radiation and various other therapeutics, including hardware implantation.
He had a left subclavian port-a-cath placed on [**9-23**] for easier chemotherapy administration in the face of poor peripheral venous access.
Mother passed of breast ca .
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in OP Neck: supple Pulmonary: Bibasilar crackles Cardiac: RRR, S1 S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Extremities: 3+ edema b/l L arm in splint.
He has marked swelling of the left arm which he states is normal Skin: Multiple sub-cutaneous tumor collections present on torso.

There is a left IJ intravenous catheter reaching the distal SVC, with no pneumothorax in this position.
The vague ground-glass opacity reported earlier is not well-demonstrated on this examination.
There is scarring or atelectasis at the left lung base with slight elevation of this hemidiaphragm.
However, there is destruction of the end of the left fourth rib with associated ill- defined and pleural-based soft tissue mass, as well as expansile destruction of the right clavicular head.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
Interval decrease in size and extent of bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities, likely representing resolving pneumonitis or pneumonia.
Stable metastatic disease including within the mediastinum and bony thorax.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 56 year old man w/progressive metastatic renal cell CA who was admitted to the intensive care unit with transient hypoxia and EKG changes.
While in the unit, he had negative enzymes x 2, suggesting his EKG changes may have been secondary to demand ischemia given his low hematocrit.
His hypoxia quickly resolved after he cleared his narcotics.
He had a CTA which was negative for pulmonary embolus.
The patient had transient hyponatremia and acute renal failure, which resolved on the floor.
