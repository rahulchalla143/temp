Patient is transferred from the ED to the ICU given requirement for pressor support.
She has been having right shoulder pain [**12-20**] recent fracture from a fall in [**2170-8-15**].
She has been home since [**Month (only) 205**] after rehab from the last hospitalization for CHF exacerbation, AF with RVR, and C. diff colitis.
Her right humeral neck fx on [**2170-8-15**] was seen on OSH film as well.
Non-focal neuro exam.
CXR was negative for infiltrate but + aortic calcification.
CT abd/pelvis obtained given elevated lactate to 4.8, which showed + ascites, diverticulosis, atherosclerotic changes, edema, and air in the bladder thought [**12-20**] Foley catheter (wet read).
EKG c/w atrial fibrillation, LAD, and no peaked T waves.
On the floor, patient c/o dry mouth.
Denied SOB, F/C, N/V, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, urinary frequency/urgency/dysuria, or weakness   Past Medical History: - atrial fibrillation on warfarin - HTN - HLD - systolic CHF, EF 25-30% on echo [**3-/2170**] - history of large B cell lymphoma, not currently on therapy - bladder incontinence - carotid artery stenosis - aortic stenosis (echo [**3-/2170**], 0.8-1.0cm2) - AR, MR, TR (echo [**3-/2170**]) - retinopathy - history of C. diff [**4-/2170**] - s/p varicose vein removal on the right - s/p tonsillectomy - s/p left salivary gland biopsy- benign  Social History: - Tobacco: quit 60 years ago - Alcohol: none - Illicits: None - lives on the lower level below her daughter [**Name (NI) **].
- used to walk with a cane prior to shoulder fracture   Family History: - mother died of kidney failure at 35 - father died of old age at 98   Physical Exam: Admission Physical Exam: Vitals: T:95.3 BP: 82/54 P: 100 R: 18-22 O2: 100% 2L General: lethargic, oriented to self/hospital/[**2169**], NAD HEENT: Sclera anicteric, mucous membrane dry, + dentures Neck: supple, JVP at the base of the neck, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: irregularly irregular, 2/6 SEM in the LUSB, leftward displaced PMI Abd: mildly distended, soft, NT, ND, BS+, no HSM, no rebound or guarding Ext: warm, dry, edematous 2+ at the feet/ankles, 1+ DP pulses bilaterally GU: + foley, slightly bloody neuro: oriented to self, answers questions appropriately, knows in the hospital and year, but falls asleep quickly.
Consultations with ID are recommended for all blood cultures          positive for Staphylococcus aureus, yeast or other fungi.

**FINAL REPORT [**2170-9-13**]**     CRYPTOCOCCAL ANTIGEN (Final [**2170-9-13**]):       POSITIVE FOR CRYPTOCOCCAL ANTIGEN.
QUANTITATIVE CRYPTOCOCCAL ANTIGEN (Final [**2170-9-13**]):       POSITIVE FOR CRYPTOCOCCAL ANTIGEN AT A TITER OF =>1:64.
Moderate ascites.
No bowel obstruction.
Moderate atherosclerotic changes in the vessels.
Moderate calcification at the mitral annulus.
Similar bilateral renal hypodensities.
Moderate anasarca.
Soft tissue edema more on the left, predominantly in the left flank.
Given the lack of IV contrast, no drainable fluid collection is seen.
Foci of air within the urinary bladder with a Foley in place could be from placement of Foley; however, correlate clinically for infection.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to inferior posterior akinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified).
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
Mild to moderate ([**11-19**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2170-4-4**], the heart rate during the previous study is significantly higher, making the left venbtricular ejection fraction and stroke volume lower, but intrinsic function is probably similar.
Severe tricuspid regurgitation was present then as it is now.
Brief Hospital Course: 83 yo F with AF on warfarin, sCHF with EF 25-30% in [**3-/2170**], h/o large B cell lymphoma, HTN, HLD who presented with hypotenstion requiring pressors.
Source of sepsis was initially unclear and patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
Additionally, patient had poor cardiac function which likely contributed to hypotension.
Patient continued to have raising lactic acidosis.
Pt was ultimately found to have fungemia and positive cryptococcal antigen.
The patient was comfortable with minimal sedation.
