Of note, she was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 45401**] with new onset BLE weakness and urinary retention, and T11-L2 and conus mets on MRI at OSH.
This morning, patient woke up with left sided frontal/temporal headache not releived by Tylenol  She felt nauseaous and had several episodes of vomitting, no blood.
She doesn not have any new focal weakness.
Urinary retention has worsened.
She denies fevers/chills, SOB, chest pain, abdominal pain, no change in mental status.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.8 HR 88 BP 139/87 RR 16 O2 100%  Patient was given morphine for pain and zofran for nausea, which were effective.
CT Head showed hemorrhagic transformation of known brain metastases with no midline shift or hydrocephalus.
She was seen by neurosurgery who stated that no intervention is needed at this time and recommended q1 hour neur checks.
She underwent wide local excision and bilateral inguinal node sentinel lymph node biopsy which revealed no melanoma.
-[**6-5**] adjuvant peptide vaccine clinical trial at the NCI for 1 year.
Restaging PET scan showed retroperitoneal disease which was biopsied on [**2134-2-18**] and proven to be melanoma.
Her torso CT revealed to be stable with further reduction of her disease however, on head CT two suspicious lesion 1.0 cm in L frontal lobe and in the periventricular white matter on the left note is made of a small hyperdense focus which also enhances on post-contrast imaging, measuring in total 4 x 3 mm.
She underwent head MRI for confirmation  and was found to have at least [**6-8**] small lesions and well as the L frontal lesion.
She was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3929**], our radiation oncologist who felt she also had leptomeningeal involvement given the location of the lesions are in the suface of the CNS.

Interval hemorrhage into two known metastatic lesions in the left anterior frontal lobe and left periventricular white matter with surrounding vasogenic edema.
Local mass effect upon the left lateral ventricle and sulcal effacement.
No shift of the midline structures or evidence of transtenorial herniation.
Hemorrhage within the lesions in left frontal and left frontoparietal periventricular white matter with increase in the size of these lesions and increased mass effect.
Increase in the size of the lesions in right temporal, left temporal, left frontal lobes, and in right periaqueductal region.
No new lesion.
Brief Hospital Course: 33F with metastatic melanoma with leptomeningeal disease, BLE weakness and loss of sensation now presents with frontal headache, nausea, and vomiting, found to have  likely hemorrhagic transformation of 2 known brain metastases on CT head.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES: .
#Hemorrhagic Transformatin of known brain mets: Pt presented with severe headaches, nausea, and vomiting with findings on CT demonstrating hemmorrhagic conversion confirmed on MRI brain.
The patient was seen by neurosurgery in the ED, who recommended no immediate surgical intervention.
Her dexamethasone dose was increased to retard swelling and she was admitted to the ICU for regular neuro checks and monitoring.
CT Chest/Abd was performed for staging and showed no new mets.
She was started on vamurefanib (study medication) and monitored for neurological changes over the next 2 days.
She tolerated the study medication well and required only occasional PRN doses of morphine for headaches and ativan for steroid-induced anxiety and muscle tension.
She was converted to PO morphine liquid (as she preferred it to her home oxycodone) and was discharged on a regimen of oxycontin 10mg [**Hospital1 **] for basal pain control and morphine liquid 5mg PO Q4hrs PRN for breakthrough (pt also continued on oxycodone by family request but warned against using both PRN oxycodone and PRN morphine for concern of increased risk of sedation and respiratory depression).
# Cauda Equina Syndrome [**1-4**] to Leptomeningeal Involvement of Melanoma: She remained neurologically stable with known BLE weakness with motor function limited to 1+/5 strength in proximal BLEs and with complete loss of sensation below her knees.
Since her prior admission she had developed worsening of her urinary and bowel retention.
A foley was placed and she was continued on her bowel regimen of senna and colace with daily PR dulcolax (she had concerns about straining for urination and bowel movements as a cause of increased intracranial pressure).
