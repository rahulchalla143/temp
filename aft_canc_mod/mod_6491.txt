In [**Month (only) 205**], she developed L hip pain which was initially treated with PT and improved.
During PT, she developed constant low back pain in the setting of being adjusted by PT.
In the context of these new medications, she developed AMS with confusion, difficulty following conversations, short term memory difficulties, slurred speech over the course of the last 2-3 weeks.
These meds were stopped but she continued to have AMS and weakness.
Also endorses 20lb unintentional weight loss in last month.
Lethargic with decreaed exercise tolerance and DOE x 2 weeks.
2 episodes of vomiting last weekend, none since.
No diarrhea, +constipation x 2 weeks.
No dysuria or frequency, endorses decreased UOP x 1 week.
She presented to her PCP yesterday who noted supraclavicular and inguinal LAD and referred her to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**].
On exam at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] she had b/l supraclavicular LAD and LLQ mass.
NCHCT showed no masses.
She was hypotensive to 90s systolic (no known h/o low BPs).
Labs showed hypercalcemia to 17.1 in a hemolyzed specimen and [**Last Name (un) **] at OSH.
Foley was placed, she was given Lasix, 4L NS and started empirically on heparin gtt given persistent tachycardia, possible malignancy, and inability to obtain CTA.
She was also given Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone at OSH given concern for PNA vs LLL mass on CXR.
MR L/T spine was performed without contrast given [**Last Name (un) **] and so poor study, showed possible central canal mass and bulky mediastinal and retroperitoneal LAD.
BPs remained stable in the 90s-100s systolic throughout so no CVL was placed.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she complains of extreme thirst.
Family at bedside report dysarthria and confusion improved from recently.
Denies fevers or chills.

Bilateral pleural effusions.
Within the limitations of a non-contrast study, no evidence of epidural abscess or intraspinal mass seen.
CT TORSO W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2154-9-12**] 9:09 AM IMPRESSION: Massive mediastinal, mesenteric, retroperitoneal, and intrapelvic lymphadenopathy, resulting in moderate obstruction of the left collecting system and likely compression of the left sciatic nerve.
No evidence of bilateral lower extremity deep venous thrombus within the visualized portions.
Dampening of the Doppler waveforms of the left common femoral vein and augmentation indicative of more central occlusion/stenosis, in the setting of known massive retroperitoneal adenopathy as demonstrated on CT. 3.
Left groin lymphadenopathy as better characterized on concurrent CT from [**2154-9-12**].
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No pulmonary hypertension or clinically-significant valvular disease seen.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
[**9-14**] CT HEAD: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or major vascular territorial infarct.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic bone lesions are seen.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of an acute intracranial process.
Increased bilateral pleural effusions with complete collapse of the left lower lobe and near complete collapse of the right lower lobe.
Overall decrease in mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy compared to the CT torso performed one week prior.
A BCL6 rearrangement is a typical cytogenetic aberration in a subset of B-cell lineage non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with large cell histology and follicular center cell origin.
A normal MYC FISH finding can result from absence of a MYC rearrangement, from an atypical MYC rearrangement, or from an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.
No dual rearrangement was observed in 200/200 nuclei, which is within the normal range (up to 1% rearrangement) for this probe in our laboratory.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 80377**] is a 44 year old female who presents with general malaise, weight loss, low back pain, hypercalcemia and bulky lymphadenopathy with concern for malignancy.
She was found to have large cell lymphoma and underwent the first cycle of [**Hospital1 **].
She was also found to have large bilateral pleural effusions and had these drained and sent for flow cytometry.
# Large cell lymphoma: She was suspected to have lymphoma based upon clinical presentation and she underwent a left inguinal lymph node dissection which confirmed large cell lymphoma.
She also had a bone marrow biopsy which showed she did not have involvement of the bone marrow by lymphoma.
CT scans of the torso showed "massive" lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum and abdomen.
She tolerated the first round of [**Hospital1 **] extremely well without side effects.
# Bilateral pleural effusions: Upon admission, patient had a 4L supplemental O2 requirement.
Her extremity dopplers were all negative for DVT and a CTA did not have evidence of a pulmonary embolus.
However, a repeat CT at that time showed that her bilateral effusions were larger.
# Hypercalcemia:  Upon presentation, she was hypercalcemic, which was most likely reflective of underlying malignant process.
She did have an elevated parathyroid hormone related peptide level.
# Fevers: Upon admission, she had intermittent temperatures with spike to 102 for the first two days of hospitalization.
She was treated with 7 days of ceftriaxone and 5 days of azithromycin, although her CT chest showed clear lung parenchyma with large bilateral effusions.
# Acute kidney insufficiency: This was multifactorial including contributions from tumor lysis syndrome, hypercalcemia, hypovolemia, and lymphadenopathy causing obstruction.
She will come to 7F for rituximab on Thursday and then she should be admitted for further cycles of dose-adjusted [**Hospital1 **] due to pleural involvement of lymphoma - Please set-up for her to have a port placed before her next cycle of [**Hospital1 **], this can be done when she returns on Thursday for rituximab - Please assess the need for ongoing DVT/PE prophylaxis with lovenox due to hypercoagulability of cancer  Medications on Admission: [**Doctor First Name **] PRN Flonase PRN Colace PRN Ibuprofen 800mg TID PRN (never more)   Discharge Medications: 1. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.

You were admitted to the hospital because you were having weight loss and lower back pain.
You were found to have lymphoma by a biopsy of your lymph nodes in the groin.
This is more likely due to enlarged lymph nodes from the lymphoma which makes it difficult to drain fluid.
