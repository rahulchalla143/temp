Admission Date:  [**2132-10-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-10-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2057-7-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Electrical cardioversion  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 75yo female who presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with 4 days of shortness of breath which became acutely worse at approx 3 am on the day of admission.
At OSH the patient reportedly gasping for air with decreased BS bilaterally and rales and was put on BIPAP.
CXR showed bilateral pulmonary edema.
EKG showed SVT with [**Street Address(2) 4793**] Elevations in 3 and AVF and depressions laterally, L axis deviation and OSH was concerned for AMI (inf/post).
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Son has unspecified mental illness.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No cervical lymphadenopathy.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: + crackles 2/3rd up, no wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No femoral bruits.
LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction ?
The inferior and posterior walls appear akinetic; the rest of the left ventricle appears hypokinetic.
with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Cardiac enlargement with coronary artery calcifications.
No evidence for pulmonary edema.
Right greater than left pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis, small perihepatic ascites with fluid tracking into the pelvis, and subcutaneous fluid/stranding probably due to third spacing.
12- mm hyperdense exophytic nodule arising from lower pole of the left kidney is suspicious for a small renal cell carcinoma.
The endometrial thickness and the size of the ovaries are more prominent than expected for the patient's age.
Ultrasound is recommended for further assessment of 2 cm thick endometrial stripe.
Differential diagnosis includes endometrial carcinoma, hyperplasia and polyps.
Colonic diverticulosis.
Likely diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver.
No splenomegaly.
[**2132-10-9**] TRANSVAGINAL ULTRASOUND: Preliminary verbal read: Thickened endometrium with cystic changes concerning for endometrial carcinoma.
On Discharge: [**2132-10-9**] 06:00AM BLOOD WBC-7.3 RBC-4.07* Hgb-12.8 Hct-39.6 MCV-97 MCH-31.3 MCHC-32.3 RDW-14.0 Plt Ct-70* [**2132-10-9**] 06:00AM BLOOD Glucose-127* UreaN-39* Creat-1.6* Na-131* K-4.4 Cl-94* HCO3-30 AnGap-11 [**2132-10-9**] 06:00AM BLOOD Calcium-8.4 Phos-4.0 Mg-2.7*  Brief Hospital Course: 75yo female with no past medical history presented from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with shortness of breath for 4 days concerning for heart failure and found to be in atrial flutter on transfer now s/p electrical cardioversion in normal sinus rhythm with renal mass on CT concerning for renal cell carcinoma and endometrium concerning for endometrial carcinoma.
# PUMP: The patient was found to have systolic heart failure with an EF of 30% with a dilated LV cavity and [**1-25**]+ MR. BNP was 9991.
ACS is unlikely given minimal enzyme elevation and non-concerning ECG.
# SHORTNESS OF BREATH: This is most consistent with acute systolic HF.
Diuresis at OSH and [**Hospital1 **] has improved her symptoms of SOB, peripheral edema, lung exam, JVD.
On discharge the patient appeared euvolemic and was not requiring O2 or continuing diuresis.
# THROMBOCYTOPENIA: isolated abnormality with normal CBC and smear (no evidence of hemolysis).
Large platelets seen on smear leads towards etiology of increased destruction.
HIT unlikely with no recent exposure.
Pt takes no medications.
No splenomegaly on CT. Hematology was consulted and they think bone marrow replacement process is unlikely, more possibly due to chronic compensated ITP.
# RENAL: Urine lytes collected after Lasix doses here and at OSH but FEurea is equivocal.
[**Last Name (un) **] is likely secondary to prerenal etiology vs cardiorenal.
CT abd shows exophytic kidney lesion concerning for RCC.
She had some hematuria while on heparin with the Foley catheter in place but it resolved after the Foley was removed.
On discharge her Creatinine was 1.6 which can be attributed to starting Lisinopril and recent contrast dye load.
# GU: Patient reports heavy periods in the past and has thickened endometrial stripe with larger than normal ovaries on CT.
This is concerning for possibly primary ovarian or endometrial process.
Transvaginal ultrasound was performed which showed expansion of the endometrium with some cystic changes worrisome for neoplasm.
The patient refused further workup so the PCP will be [**Name (NI) 653**] regarding setting up a pelvic MRI and OB/GYN followup for possible endometrial cancer.
Disp:*8 syringes* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospice and VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Atrial flutter Chronic Systolic Dysfunction: EF 30% Hyperdense Left Renal Pole Exophytic nodule concerning for RCC Endometrial enlargement with cysts concerning for endometrial cancer Thrombocytopenia Acute Renal Failure  Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You had atrial flutter that was cardioverted and you are now in a normal sinus rhythm.
You were also started on amiodarone to prevent the reoccurance of atrial flutter.
START Warfarin (coumadin) daily to prevent a stroke from the atrial flutter.
