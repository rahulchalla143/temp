Admission Date: [**2158-6-7**]        Discharge Date: [**2158-6-14**]   Service:  CME   CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea and painful right foot.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79-year old female admitted to [**Hospital6 10353**] on [**5-26**] with a chief complaint of dyspnea.
The patient also complained of a painful right foot.
The patient stated that she had a one week history of increased dyspnea.
The patient was felt to be in congestive heart failure.
She was ruled out for a myocardial infarction and was diuresed.
Her foot was debrided and grew out Staphylococcus aureus as well as a group B Streptococcus.
An echocardiogram was performed which revealed LVH, akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls, anterolateral wall hypokinesis, with an ejection fraction of 30 percent, and severe mitral regurgitation.
There was a valve area of 0.6 percent; felt to be consistent with severe aortic stenosis.
The patient also had evidence of mild aortic insufficiency and moderate-to- severe tricuspid regurgitation.
The patient was transferred to the Transitional Care Unit at which time she developed oliguria with an increased creatinine to 4.5.
She was found to be hypotensive as well as in renal failure.
Her blood pressure increased, and she also had increased urine output with her creatinine decreasing from 4.5 to 1.3.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for type 2 diabetes complicated by peripheral neuropathy.
Coronary artery disease.
Ventricular aneurysm in [**2150**]; status post surgical repair.
History of inferior posterior myocardial infarction 10 years ago complicated by LV free wall rupture and pseudoanuerysm repaired at [**Hospital1 18**].

History of peripheral vascular disease.
Ischemia right medial hallux.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
On review of systems, the patient had no chest pain.
She did have dyspnea on exertion with increasing lower extremity edema.
No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
Increased shortness of breath with exertion.
No palpitations, syncope, or presyncope.
No illicit substances.
She appeared in no acute distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination was significant for normocephalic and atraumatic.
There was no evidence of thyromegaly on examination.
Heart was regular in rate and rhythm with a 3/6 systolic murmur at the left and right upper sternal borders as well as the left lower sternal border with radiation to the axilla.
The lungs were clear to auscultation with crackles at the bases.
No wheezes or rales were noted.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.
No evidence of hepatosplenomegaly.
No masses were palpated.
Extremities were significant for no clubbing or cyanosis but trace edema that was nonpitting.
On the patient's right foot there is an open wound adjacent to the first big toe with no active drainage, no erythema, and no edema.
There was also a stage 1 decubitus ulceration on the patient's coccyx.
Pulses were dopplerable; that is, both dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally.
No acute ST changes.
The patient had T wave inversions in V1 through V4 as well as in II and III.
On telemetry, the patient had evidence of a normal sinus rhythm with no ectopy.
Urine culture was consistent with yeast.
Aerobic culture was no growth.
Wound culture from [**6-12**]; again, Gram stain was significant 1 plus polymorphonuclear neutrophils and no microorganisms.
Wound culture with no growth.
Aerobic culture with no growth.
The left ventricular cavity was mildly dilated.
Overall left systolic ejection fraction was severely depressed.
There was severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets were 3 and mildly thickened.
There was moderate aortic valve stenosis.
There was 1 plus atrial regurgitation was seen.
Mild 1 plus mitral regurgitation was seen.
The mitral regurgitation is eccentric.
Moderate-to-severe 3 plus tricuspid regurgitation was seen.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension was seen.
Physiologic pulmonary regurgitation was seen.
No pericardial effusion.
Coronary angiography of a right-dominant system revealed moderate two vessel disease.
The left anterior descending artery and its major branches had no significant disease.
The left circumflex had minimal distal vessel 70 percent stenosis.
The right coronary artery had moderate luminal irregularities distally, up to 40 percent stenosed.
Resting hemodynamic measurements demonstrated elevated right heart filling pressures.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension was noted with pulmonary artery pressure of 16/14 mmHg with a calculated peripheral vascular distance of 363 dynes seconds per cm5, and mildly elevated left heart filling pressures, with a mean capillary wedge pressure of 15 mmHg, and a left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 14 mmHg.
There was approximately 43 mmHg peak, and 36 mm mean gradient across the aortic valve, and mildly diminished cardiac output, an index of 3.9 liters per minute, and 2.4 liters per minute m2; respectively, for a calculated valve area of approximately 0.6 cm2.
Left ventriculography revealed severe regional systolic ventricular dysfunction.
There was severe anterior and apical hypokinesis and dyskinesis of the inferior wall with prominent aneurysm of the inferior basal segment.
Final diagnoses included noncritical two vessel coronary artery disease, severe aortic stenosis, moderate mitral regurgitation, and severe regional systolic ventricular dysfunction.
The case was discussed with Cardiothoracic Surgery, and it was felt that given the patient's active infection in the right foot that aortic valve replacement should be deferred until a later time after the patient has been on antibiotics for an adequate amount of time.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was maintained on aspirin.
The patient underwent x-rays of her right foot which revealed no fracture, evidence of bony destruction involving the head of the right first metatarsal consistent with osteitis.
There has been an amputation through the base of the proximal phalanx of the second digit.
No radiopaque foreign bodies were seen.
The left foot views revealed that there was a hallux valgus deformity.
No radiopaque foreign bodies noted.
Infectious Disease also stated that should an aortic valve replacement be necessitated prior to six weeks of intravenous antibiotics, at least two weeks of intravenous antibiotics are recommended and that the ptient should have surveillance blood cultures after this date, and if the patient's blood cultures are negative that the patient could then proceed with aortic valve replacement should it be necessitated before six weeks of antibiotics could be completed.
PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient also underwent magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography of her lower extremities to assess for peripheral vascular disease and to see if she could possibly be a candidate for stenting.
Mild atherosclerotic changes were present in the infrarenal abdominal aorta without evidence of aneurysm or dilatation.
The assessment of the first station was limited due to technical factors and venous contamination; however, the iliac vessels appeared grossly normal to the level of the femoral arteries with no hemodynamically significant stenosis.
The superficial femoral artery on the right leg had minimal atherosclerotic changes at the adductor canal.
The anterior tibial artery appeared normal throughout its course and as it enters the dorsalis pedis artery there was mild narrowing at the tibiofemoral trunk.
There was mild proximal narrowing.
In the left leg, there was a surgical clip in the proximal superficial femoral artery which obscured evaluation of a very focal region of this area.
The anterior tibial artery had mild narrowing in its distal third but remains normal in caliber as it enters a normal-appearing dorsalis pedis.
The posterior tibial artery becomes diffusely atherosclerotic distally and was not identified at the ankle.
The proximal peroneal artery appeared normal with diffuse disease distally.
The final impression was no significant aortoiliac disease, mild narrowing at the right tibioperoneal trunk, and of the distal peroneal artery, and diffuse disease of the left profunda femoral artery, mild narrowing of the mid segment of the anterior tibial artery, and diffuse disease of the distal posterior tibial and peroneal arteries with apparent occlusion of the these two vessels at the ankle.
CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY ISSUES:  The patient's creatinine remained at her baseline.
Additionally, the patient had no evidence of urine eosinophils.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient was maintained on a 2-gram cardiac diet as well as a diabetic diet.
The patient did have elevated platelet counts in the range of 500s; however, there was no evidence of thrombo occlusive events.
Her liver function tests at the [**Hospital1 69**] were within normal limits except a mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase at 130.
FINAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Severe aortic stenosis.
Congestive heart failure.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Degenerative joint disease.
Peripheral vascular disease.
No chest pain.
