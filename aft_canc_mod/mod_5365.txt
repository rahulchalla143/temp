Admission Date:  [**2164-1-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-2-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2097-3-18**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracentesis x2 Tracheostomy   History of Present Illness: Patient is a 66 yo f with pmh of stage iv renal cell ca, also s/p recent colonic perforation with igmoid colectomy/Low anterior resection with end colostomy and Hartmann's procedure, who comes in with hypercarbic respiratory acidosis.
She had a recent admission for debulking nephrectomy for her RCC however, it was never performed as she developed gram negative bacteremia (B fragilis in [**12-5**] bottles) and subsequent bowel perforation.
Finally today was sent into the ED for worsening respiratory status.
Pt was found to have a increased pleural effusion (L>R), LLL opacity.
Pt was noted to be in severe respiratory distress with RR in 50s ABG was found to be 7.21/104/200.
Past Medical History: 1. emphysema/COPD 2. osteoporosis 3. fibrocystic breasts 4. s/p appendectomy 5. s/p ovarian cystectomy 6. s/p shoulder surgery 7. stage IV renal cell carcinoma  Social History: She is a widow.
Father died of complications of a peptic ulcer disease.
Brother died at age 12  of metastatic sarcoma.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Thought to be multifactorial, including pneumonia, CHF, and COPD exacerbation.
A thoracentesis was performed on HD2 for the large R pleural effusion, with removal of approximately 700cc fluid which was consistent with a transudate, and negative for malignant cells.
The patient remained intubated with RSBI scores around 150 suggesting she was a poor candidate for extubation, although attempts were made to optimize the chances for her success by diuresis and controlling her heart rate and blood pressure, initially with labetalol gtt then PO labetalol.
# Recent colonic perforation.
# RCC.
# Leukocytosis.
# Peripheral edema.
Thought to be due to hypoalbuminemia.
# HTN.
The patient was re-admitted to the MICU service [**2164-1-25**] after a Code Blue was called for an apparent PEA arrest.
A CTA was done and was negative for PE and serial cardiac biomarkers were negative as a possible etiology of the PEA arrest.
A L pleural effusionw as removed by thoracentesis at the bedside.
For chronic obstructive lung disease, the patient has been tapered off steroid from 60mg qday now to 20mg qday.
Renal u/s revealed new hematoma around her foley, so a three-way foley was placed and continuous bladder irrigation was done.
The patient still has a foley currently and needs to be removed at rehab as the patient has urinary tract infection that she is getting treated with Ciprofloxacin which she will complete on [**2-9**].
The patient will need to follow-up with her oncologist for renal cell carcinoma and decide on the date for debulking procedure.
For her anemia, iron studies were consistent with anemia of chornic disease likely [**12-22**] her renal cell carcinoma and was started on Epogen.
The patient developed delirium and suicidal ideation soon after tracheostomy and psych was consulted and started haldol 1mg [**Hospital1 **].
The patient's delirium has cleared since the initiation of haldol but still intermittently sundowns, so her mental status needs to be monitored and follow-up with her primary care physician and determine on whether to continue haldol or not.
For prophylaxis, the patient has been getting subcutaneous heparin, and until ambulatory, pt will likely need subcutaneous heparin given her high risk for DVT and PE due to her cancer.
