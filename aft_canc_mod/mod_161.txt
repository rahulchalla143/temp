There is mild scoliosis.
There is mild cardiomegaly.
There are multifocal patchy airspace opacities predominantly in the right and left lower lobes.
There is likely a small left-sided pleural effusion.
Severe atheromatous disease in abdominal aorta.
Bilateral lower lobe airspace disease.
Echo [**2116-7-6**]: EF 30-35%, Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferior akinesis, inferolateral hypokinesis, and apical hypokinesis.
Grade III/IV (severe) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
Brief Hospital Course: 85 y/o F with MDS/RAEB who p/w multifocal pneumonia.
* CHF vs. NSTEMI: Elevated Trop in setting of likely heart failure, unclear whether this represents infarct vs. heart failure.
No CK elevation.
After transfer to the floor she had an episode of hypotension, with normal EKG, that was thought to be due to hypovolemia in the context of a Hct of 21.
* Pneumonia: The bil LL pneumonia was identified on CT abdomen when pt initially presented at OSH with abdominal pain.
The CXR at [**Hospital1 **] revealed multifocal pneumonia.
CXR ([**7-8**])shows improving consolidation in right lower lobe, likely pneumonia.
Improving edema and improving left lower lobe atelectasis.
RUQ ultrasound here with sludge, but no gallstones or dilatation to suggest cholecystitis.
* Hyperglycemia: no history of Diabetes.
Anemia due to MDS.
Weekly CBC and f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
* Possible esophogeal mass: Distal esophageal diverticulum versus ulcerated mass seen at the distal third of esophagus on CT abdomen/pelvis at [**Hospital 6136**] Hospital.
EGD versus barium swallow.
* Lung mass: Concern for RLL mass on CXR.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: NSTEMI b/l PNA CHF Hypotension Abdominal pain, likely due to pleural irritation Hyperglycemia, likely due to stress response MDS with RAEB ......................... Long QT syndrome   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Discharge Instructions: Please come back to the hospital or notify your providers if you have any chest pain, worsening shortness of breath, fevers or chills.
