Over the past few weeks, she has noticed increasing "heaviness" in throat and under her left arm when she is walking or carrying laundry up the stairs.
She was found to have anemia and was transfused two units at the OSH.
As part of her workup for her microcytic anemia, she was to be scoped by GI, and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization for cardiac clearance for colonoscopy.
She denies any weight loss, fevers, changes in her appetite, or changes in stool.
Family History: Father died of heart failure in his late 70's, mother died of cancer at age 82.
Two brothers with heart problems (angioplasty and bypass), one sister with 2 "mild" strokes.

No ST changes.
Cath [**2107-7-8**]: Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed flow limiting epicardial coronary artery disease.
The LMCA was a long vessel with no apparent obstruction.
The LAD had a promixal 85% stenosis and then a 40% stenosis more distally.
CT Scan Abd/Pelvis, +/- contrast, [**2107-7-8**]: Asymmetry of the distal rectal wall.
Two hypoattenuating subcentimeter lesions in the liver, too small to  characterize.
Multiple hypoattenuating lesions in both kidneys, most of which are too small to characterize.
Extensive diverticulosis involving the sigmoid colon, transverse colon, and ascending colon, without evidence of diverticulitis.
Exam not tailored for detection of colon cancer and dedicated colonoscopy or virtual CT colonoscopy would be necessary for this purpose if colon cancern is suspected clinically.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 year old woman with chest discomfort on exertion in the setting of microcytic anemia, requiring cardiac clearance prior to colonoscopy for workup of the anemia.
She had cardiac catheterization on [**2107-7-8**], which showed three-vessel disease.
She had one CT of abdomen/pelvis, which was non-specific, showing thickening of the rectal wall and several hypodense sub-centimeter lesions in the kidneys and liver, but ruling out largely metastatic disease.
It was decided to get an EGD/colonoscopy, which showed mild gastritis and an adenomatous polyp in the ascending colon.
