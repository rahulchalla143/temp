IMAGING [**5-25**] CXR IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process .
[**5-26**] CT ABD/PELVIS CT OF THE ABDOMEN: Bibasilar areas of dependent atelectasis are noted.
There is no pleural effusion.
Small-to-moderate hiatal hernia is noted.
No focal hepatic lesion is identified.
There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
There is no gallbladder wall edema or pericholecystic fluid collection to suggest acute inflammation.
There are no calcified gallstones within its lumen.
The pancreas enhances homogeneously without ductal dilatation or peripancreatic fluid collection.
Kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without evidence of hydronephrosis .
A 6-mm left mid ureteral stone is unchanged in position without evidence of associated hydroureteronephrosis.
There is a 1.2 x 1 enhancing lesion arising from the upper pole of the left kidney (4a:44).
There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.
A small fat-containing umbilical hernia is noted.
Increased amount of contrast is seen layering at the site of extravasation on delayed phase imaging.
No additional area of active contrast extravasation is noted.
There is no free air or free fluid within the pelvis.
No pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes are seen.
CTA: Intraabdominal aorta and its branches are notable for extensive calcified atherosclerotic disease without associated aneurysmal changes.
There is moderate narrowing at its origin, likely related to calcified atherosclerotic disease.
A replaced right hepatic artery originating from the SMA is noted.
Area of active contrast extravasation at the level of the cecum, concerning for active bleeding.
A 1.2 x 1 cm left renal enhancing lesion is compatible with RCC.
If surgery is not considered, follow up examination in six months is recommended to assess for interval change.
A 6-mm left ureteral stone, unchanged in position since [**2123-5-11**] exam without associated hydroureteronephrosis.
[**5-27**] COLONOSCOPY Findings:  Protruding Lesions Several smal polyps under 5mm were noted throughout the colon.
None were removed in the setting of her recent GI bleed.
Excavated Lesions Multiple non-bleeding diverticula with mixed openings were seen in the sigmoid colon.
Diverticulosis appeared to be of moderate severity.
A single non-bleeding 4 cm ulcer was found in the cecum consistent with her prior polypectomy site.
Impression: Cecal ulcer was noted at the prior EMR site.
There were no stigmata of bleeding.
There is no visible residual adenomatous tissue.
Several clips were applied to the close the defect given recent CT angio evidence of cecal bleeding.
Internal hemorrhoids Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon Several small polyps were noted throughout the colon.
None were removed given her recent GI bleed Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum   Brief Hospital Course: 80 F with hx diverticulosis, CAD, and recent polypectomy on [**2123-5-10**] p/w acute-onset BRBPR with hospital course complicated by NSTEMI  # GI bleed: Pt presented w/acute-onset BRBPR likely due to be bleeding from recent polypectomy site.
CTA of the abdomen/pelvis showed an area of active contrast extravasation at the level of the cecum with associated hematoma.
Colonoscopy was performed on [**5-27**], although no active bleeding was visualized GI clipped two areas near site of prior polypectomy.
There has been no further evidence of bleeding since the endoscopy.
While being turned in bed on [**5-27**] she experienced transient substernal chest pain with ST depression and troponin trending up to peak of 0.12.
Cardiology consulted, felt she had likely had an NSTEMI rather than demand-related ischemia, although the latter is possible in light of GI bleed.
She had one additional episode of chest pain several days later, without EKG changes, that  resolved with SLNG.
This was likely due to her imdur and other anti-hypertensives being held.
After re-starting imdur she had no further episodes of chest pain.
