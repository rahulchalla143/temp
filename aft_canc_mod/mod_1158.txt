Admission Date:  [**2137-4-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2137-4-25**]  Date of Birth:   [**2058-9-25**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 34713**] is a 75-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma transferred from rehabilitation after he was found to have reddish-brown hemoptysis, tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 36, and requiring 35% oxygen.
Course at [**Hospital6 1708**] was notable for intermittent intubation, bronchoscopy that demonstrated left main stem proximal abnormality, and a right main stem involved with metastatic disease including the bronchus intermedius.
Purulent secretions were also noted in the right middle lobe and right lower lobe.
However, there was no definitive source of hemorrhage found, and the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility with 3 liters by nasal cannula.
Within hours of being transferred to rehabilitation, the patient again began tachypneic and started with hemoptysis with an increased oxygen requirement.
Status post left wedge resection for a pulmonary nodule consistent with metastatic clear cell carcinoma in [**2132-3-31**].
c.  A computed tomography of the abdomen an pelvis showed no mass at that time.
e.  [**2133-12-2**] revealed a right pleural effusion which was tapped.
Six weeks later, he was found to have a recurrent effusion.
A computed tomography of the chest showed a loculated right pleural effusion with a subcarinal mediastinal mass as well as a right lower lobe lesion and focal lobar lesion.
f.  The patient has undergone photodynamic therapy, brachy therapy, left lung wedge resection, and YAG laser therapy for his endobronchial lesions but continued to have intractable hemoptysis.
Small-bowel obstruction; status post partial bowel resection.
Endobronchial lesion; status post photodynamic therapy, brachy therapy, left lung wedge resection, YAG laser therapy.
Status post prostatectomy for benign prostatic hypertrophy in [**2124**].
History of deep venous thrombosis 20 years ago.
Myelodysplastic syndrome.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Pacemaker for symptomatic bradycardia.
Atrial fibrillation.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, the patient was in moderate respiratory distress.
While receiving nebulizers, he was speaking in short sentences and sitting upright.
Cardiovascular examination with a irregular and irregular rate with a 2/6 systolic murmur that starts at the apex.
Lungs with diffuse expiratory wheezing bilaterally.
Extremities were warm with 3+ bilateral lower extremity edema.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 89 with flat T waves in lead III.
No acute ST-T wave inversions.
A chest x-ray showed multiple pulmonary nodules in the left and right lung with a right lower lobe/right middle lobe opacity.
There were bilateral pleural effusions with the right greater than the left, and there was a left rib abnormality.
HEMOPTYSIS ISSUES:  The patient was admitted with intractable hemoptysis despite multiple procedures performed at [**Hospital6 1708**].
The patient has known endobronchial lesions from his metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
While at rehabilitation, within hours of arriving, he developed tachypnea and respiratory distress.
The bronchoscopy showed multiple tracheal lesions including a carinal lesion with partial obstruction of the left main and almost 95% obstruction of the right main.
Following extubation, the patient stated that he felt less short of breath but was still extremely tachypneic and using accessory muscles with respiration.
He had no further episodes of gross frank hemoptysis; however, he continued to cough significant amounts of brownish purulent sputum.
He was still very short of breath and tachypneic at times; especially with exertion.
However, the patient symptomatically felt slightly better.
He was continued on his albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers as well as cough suppressants throughout the hospitalization.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ISSUES:  The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on amiodarone and beta blocker.
He had previously been on Coumadin, but his Coumadin was held due to ongoing hemoptysis.
QUESTION OF A RIGHT LOWER LOBE INFILTRATE ISSUES:  The patient had a right lower lobe infiltrate seen on chest x-ray on admission.
There may also be a postobstructive component of this due to his multiple lesions in his bronchus.
He remained afebrile throughout the remainder of the hospitalization.
ANASARCA ISSUES:  The patient had generalized anasarca on admission.
His albumin was low, and he also had an elevated spot urine protein to creatine ratio.
An ultrasound of the right upper extremity was negative for deep venous thrombosis.
It was believed that his generalized anasarca was due to very poor nutrition and hypoalbuminemia.
THROMBOCYTOPENIA ISSUES:  The patient had thrombocytopenia on admission which was believed likely due to his myelodysplastic syndrome.
A video swallow study showed aspiration with thin liquids and nectar consistency despite swallowing maneuvers.
Speech and Swallow diagnosed the patient with a moderate/severe pharyngeal dysphagia due to significant pharyngeal weakness resulting in poor airway protection, severe pharyngeal residue, and aspiration of thin and thick liquids.
They are very interested in learning if there are any further possible options for treatment.
It was explained to the patient that he will continue to have episodes of respiratory distress given his metastatic pulmonary nodules.
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Out of bed to chair with assistance; oxygen saturation stable on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula; short of breath at rest; tachypneic; using accessory muscles with respiration; hemodynamically stable otherwise.
Metastatic renal cell cancer.
Endobronchial lesions; status post Y-stent placement.
Atrial fibrillation.
Aspiration pneumonia.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Generalized anasarca due to poor nutrition and hypoalbuminemia.
Thrombocytopenia likely due to myelodysplastic syndrome.
Phenol septic throat spray as needed (for sore throat).
