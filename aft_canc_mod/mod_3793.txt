The patient also experienced an episode of hypoglycemia this morning (finger stick of 25) which he treated with [**Location (un) 2452**] juice and glucose with rapid resolution.
He denies chest pain and worsening cough.
He does report increased shortness of breath but has not needed to increase his home oxygen use.
He denies any recent medication changes, or dietary changes.
He denies hemoptysis.
No recent sick contacts.
In the ED the patient was found to be afebrile, hypoxic with an O2 sat of 84% on 100% O2, and hypotensive with a BP of 83/60 and HR 92.
His hypotension resolved with IV fluids.
An EKG was performed which revealed a right bundle branch block and there was concern for anterioseptal ST-depression.
Cardiology was consulted who did not feel that he was experience an acute coronary event.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 66 year old male with multiple medical problems including diabetes, COPD on oxygen at baseline, hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presented to the [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes clinic complaining of increased fatigue, shortness of breath and cough for the past three weeks.
Pt was admitted to the MICU for management of respiratory distress with hypercarbic hypoxia.
# Hypoxemia: We originally considered cardiac versus primary respiratory etiologies for his hypoxia.
There was no evidence of ischemia per routine cycling of cardiac markers.
Additionally, clinical exam, TTE, and CXR failed to reveal significant evidence of CHF, and CT-PA was negative for PE.
Physical exam and CXR findings appeared most consistent with an exacerbation of COPD, possibly compounded by underlying cardiac disease.
At discharge, pt had returned to his clinical baseline, with mildly increased O2 requirement vs. baseline (currently SpO2 >88% on 6 L NC).
# Diabetes: [**Last Name (un) **] continued to follow during admission, adjusting insulin dosing as needed in the face of inflammation and steroid use.
# Hypertension: BP was well-controlled on home meds (Toprol XL 50 mg, Norvasc 5 mg, Lisinopril 20 mg); lasix, diovan, and spironolactone were held during this admission due to thickened resp secretions suggesting the need for hydration.
# Hyperkalemia - Resolved with withdrawal of agents with a tendency to induce hyperkalemia (spironolactone).
# A-Fib - chronic coumadin for anticoagulation, toprol for rate control; INR 1.3 at discharge, so returned to home-dose coumadin schedule (initially altered due to INR 4.5 on admission).
# Chronic Kidney Disease: Stable at baseline, admission Cr 1.3 improved rapidly with fluid resuscitation.
# Hyperlipidemia - continued lipitor 80 mg daily and niaspan 500 mg daily.
# Depression, Anxiety - continued home Xanax PRN, zoloft 50 mg [**Hospital1 **].
# FEN: Renal, diabetic, heart healthy diet.
# Prophylaxis:  DVT (on coumadin, daily ambulation), GI (PPI).
