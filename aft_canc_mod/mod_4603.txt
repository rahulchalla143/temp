HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 64-year-old gentleman with 02 requirement at home who has had several months of dyspnea on exertion.
The patient says he has been unable to walk out of his bedroom without feeling shortness of breath.
He denies any other weight loss and has been seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] and comes to the [**Hospital1 18**] for a thoracotomy and segmentectomy for his lung mass that was seen on CT.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for COPD and BPH.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Notable for left knee replacement, left distal interphalangeal index finger amputation, left carpal tunnel release.
Mother died of MI and gastric carcinoma.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known allergies.
Lungs were decreased over the bilateral bases.
He was a regular rate and rhythm, plus S1/S2 with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The patient was obese, soft, distended, but nontender abdomen.
No clubbing, cyanosis or edema noted on the lower extremities.
Upon presentation, the patient was sent for a CT scan with contrast; which was notable for a 5.2- x 5-cm right lung mass with several small adjacent satellite nodules.
An x-ray was also obtained on the 17th which showed a large right hilar mass.
No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
The patient tolerated the procedure well without any real complications.
Postoperative chest x-ray was noted which showed a posterior section of atelectasis of the remnant upper lung with a 17-mm apical pneumothorax and an indwelling chest tube x 2.
His left chest showed decreased breath sounds with a faint wheeze.
They were both to suction with no air leak seen, and they were pulling serosanguineous material.
A chest x-ray was obtained on the 20th which again - compared to the 19th - showed a small right apical pneumothorax which had a slight increase in size.
There was a new right streaking mid lung field opacity; which was probably due to atelectasis.
He did become anxious and agitated overnight, and causing him to remove his [**Doctor Last Name 406**] chest tube and his peripheral IV.
On the 21st, as well, the apical chest tube was also removed and an x-ray was also obtained which showed a moderate hydropneumothorax which was relatively unchanged from previous exams.
On the 22nd, the patient again underwent another chest x-ray which showed a slightly increased pneumothorax with a significantly pleural effusion which was possibly loculated.
Later in that afternoon he underwent another chest x-ray which showed an interval decrease in the size of the right apical pneumothorax.
His right lung mass and superimposed mild edema were also seen.
There was also a right lung mass resection with postoperative clips seen.
The patient is doing well today, and he is no acute distress.
He has a soft, obese, distended but nontender belly.
No clubbing, cyanosis or edema is noted.
A PT evaluation was obtained on the 20th, which said the patient would probably need pulmonary rehab for his pulmonary issues and for pulmonary PT.
DISCHARGE STATUS/INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is status post a segmentectomy for a right upper lobe lung mass.
He is going to be sent to a rehab facility for pulmonary toilet and postoperative care.
The facility was told that he should come back to the [**Hospital1 18**] for the following reasons: Temperature greater than 101.5, increasing pain, nausea or vomiting which may be noted, increased shortness of breath above the 2-liter oxygen requirement that the patient maintains at home, increasing pain or any shortness of breath that the patient may experience.
MAJOR INVASIVE PROCEDURE:  The patient is status post a right posterior and apical segmentectomy.
DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  He is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] in 2 to 3 weeks for a postoperative care evaluation and monitoring of his pulmonary status.
