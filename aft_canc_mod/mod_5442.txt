SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the mid to distal anterior wall, anterior septum and apex and moderate hypokinesis of the anterolateral wall.. Diastolic function could not be assessed.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

[**2145-4-1**] Intraop TEE: PRE BYPASS The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45 %).
In addition, the anterior, anterolateral, anteroseptal and apical walls have slightly more hypokinesis then the rest of the other myocardial segments.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
The left ventricle displays slightly improved global function with continued mild hypokinesis of the anterior, anteroseptal, anterolateral, and apical segments.
The mitral regurgitation is slightly worse, now mild.

He remained pain free on intravenous Heparin and medical therapy.
The following day, he underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
Carotid ultrasound found only minimal disease of the internal carotid arteries.
He remained pain free and was eventually cleared for surgery.
He did have multifocal atrial tachycardia for which EP was consulted.
