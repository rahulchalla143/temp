EGD [**5-/2150**] showed evidence of Barrett's from 26 cm to 36 cm.
There was evidence of a nodule at 32 cm, which was biopsied as well.
Biopsies from [**State 1727**] showed evidence of Barrett's metaplasia again indefinite for dysplasia.
The biopsies from the nodule showed high-grade dysplasia but they could not rule out an underlying carcinoma.
Our pathologist felt that Mr. [**Known lastname 20756**] had evidence of low-grade dysplasia in several of the random biopsies.
The esophageal nodule had evidence of adenocarcinoma.
There was no muscularis mucosa or submucosa to evaluate for potential invasive component.
Patient then saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of GI for endomucosal resection.
Results of the resection showed high-grade dysplasia with intramucosal carcinoma.
The deep margin was fine, but unfortunately, this extends focally to the peripheral margin and did also have focal lymphatic invasion.
Past Medical History: PMH: Barrett's esophagus s/p bx showing high grade dysplasia, possible gastroparesis previously on reglan, asthma took inhalers for 30 years (quiescent since [**2144**])  PSH: esophageal EMR [**2150-7-7**] w/ invasive adenocarcinoma   Social History: Mr. [**Known lastname 20756**] is married.

Barium Swallow [**2150-9-18**]: Normal postoperative appearance with no evidence of anastomotic leak or stricture.
Barrett's esophagus involving distal 8 cm of esophagus with extensive low-grade and multifocal high-grade dysplasia; no residual carcinoma identified.
Distal gastric and proximal esophageal (squamous lined) margins are unremarkable.
Mildly active esophagitis.
Fourteen lymph nodes with rare non-necrotizing granulomas consistent with prior procedure; no malignancy identified.
; B.  Paraesophageal lymph node, resection: One lymph node; no evidence of malignancy.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted for MIE for esophageal cancer.
Patient had no acute ICU issues POD1 and was transferred to [**Wardname **].
Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received Dilaudid IV/PCA with good effect and adequate pain control.
Patient had persistent supplemental O2 requirement.
Chest tube was removed [**9-19**] with post pull CXR negative for PTX.
CXR POD6 showed retained barium in conduit.
[**9-16**] patient had some choking with with lunch followed by acute shortness of breath.
Patient made NPO given concern for aspiration.
EGD [**9-17**] showed retained food w no stricture.
Repeat barium swallow [**9-18**] was negative for leak or stricture.
Cervical JP had high output with high triglycerides [**9-18**].
Was taken off suction [**9-20**] and output decreased significantly.
Vancomycin, cipro and flagyl (all IV) were started [**9-17**] for rising WBC, concern for aspiration and further concern for a question of purulent JP output [**9-18**].
The patient's temperature was closely watched for signs of infection.
