For many years she did not think it was significant enough to warrant attention, however, last year she began to have difficulty climbing stairs.
She saw Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital1 18**] and had an EMG which showed severe motor and sensory neuropathy in the legs with so little preserved that it was difficult to further characterize.
Now for the last few months she has noted some involvement of her arms and neck as well.
She reports that a scan of her chest revealed a thymus tumor that she was told is benign and doesn't need to be removed.
She has not noted shortness of breath, dysphagia, diplopia or blurred vision.

However, I believe that her neck weakness and reports of quick fatigue as well as bluriness when watching the TV in her hospital room are very suspicious for myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**].
I would like to get an EMG/NCS also with single fiber or repetitive stim testing for neuromuscular junction disease.
She does not complain of SOB or dysphagia, however, I would like to get a baseline NIF and VC.
LP may still be necessary to further investigate her neuropathy and CIDP must be  entertained given its long and insidious course.
