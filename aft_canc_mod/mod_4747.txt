Admission Date:  [**2162-1-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2162-1-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2087-9-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1928**] Chief Complaint: Pneumonia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation and mechanical ventilation   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 2643**] is a 74 year old man with a recent diagnosis of squamous cell cancer of the head and neck.
One week ago, he was discharged after a new diagnosis of neck cancer.
On arrival to [**Location (un) 620**], was in afib with RVR with rates to 170s; cardioversion was attempted and not successful.
Was hypotensive and started on levophed, neosynephrine, and vasopressin and intubated.
CT scan of the chest showed a left sided pneumonia.
CTA of his chest showed no PE, but after volume resuscitation demonstrated a massive LUL pneumonia.
Stress dose steroids were discontinued as no concern for adrenal insufficiency.
-new diagnosis of metastatic neck cancer 1 wk ago, has pulmonary nodules concerning for mets but no other known metastatic sites.
He has been at a nursing home since that time with no recent alcohol consumption.
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: Hr 99, BP 109/55, RR 26, 95% 2L NC Gen - comfortable, NAD HEENT: NCAT, o/p with large mass in right side, dried blood Neck supple Lungs decreased b/s biaterally at bases and in LUL.
Heart Irregular, mildly tachycardic, no murmurs noted Abd: soft NTND ext: wwp.
Complete consolidation of the left lower lobe without significant volume loss, consistent with massive pneumonia.
Right lower lobe infiltrate.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
Significant atherosclerotic disease.
Appearance of thickened bladder wall in a partially collapsed bladder, incompletely assessed.
Recommend clinical correlation to exclude cystitis or urinary tract infection.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or major vascular territorial infarct.
Expansile, sclerotic bony lesion centered in the sphenoid bone, likely bone metastasis.
Global atrophy with chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
[**2162-1-14**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anteroseptum and anterior wall hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Very small pericardial effusion.
[**2162-1-14**] Catheter Placement IMPRESSION: Successful fluoroscopically guided repositioning of a right upper extremity PICC line.
Barium passed freely through the oropharynx and esophagus without evidence of obstruction.
There is no gross aspiration or penetration.
There is a combination of left lower lobe consolidation with left pleural effusion that overall appears to be improved since [**2162-1-14**].
There is also overall improvement of pulmonary edema, but the asymmetric appearance of the left basal consolidation is concerning for infection.
Another asymmetric area in more diffuse manner is in the right upper lobe that also might be consistent with partial resolution of pulmonary edema versus infectious process.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 2643**] is a 74 year old man with a recent diagnosis of a squamous cell head/neck cancer who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with septic shock from pneumonia.
# Pneumonia: He had an extensive pneumonia visible on CT scan when he presented.
There was no growth in any of the sputum or blood cultures.
He will need a follow-up CT chest in [**5-18**] weeks to ensure resolution of infiltrate.
# Thromobocytopenia: Mr. [**Known lastname 2643**] had a decrease in his platelets during admission of 50%.
A pf4 test was cancelled because he did not meet criteria for testing.
There were multiple reasons for his thrombocytopenia including sepsis, bleeding, and drug effect.
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: A. fib likely a response to sepsis.
Elevation in enzymes thought likely related to increased demand/sepsis/atrial fibrillation.
He was not started on aspirin initially out of concern for bleeding given his presentation of coffee ground emesis, which was likely to be blood from is SCC in his mouth.
A f/u TTE revealed an EF 40% and mild anterior wall hypokinesis.
# Squamous cell cancer: Patient has a squamous cell cancer.
The mass was bleeding during his stay in the ICU.
This was likely causing his coffee ground emesis.
# Bleeding from foley: Patient initially presented with bleeding after self-removal of foley.
His urine had trace blood after removal.
He had no difficulty urinating.
He was delirious from sepsis and ICU.
His foley and telemetry were discontinued to decrease delirium triggers.
# Swallow evaluation: Patient was evaluated by speech and swallow given the mass in his mouth.
However, a video swallow showed no aspiration.
He took his pills whole in puree or nectar thick liquids.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] Northeast - [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Pneumonia  Secondary Diagnosis: Squamous Cell cancer of the head and neck   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Confused - sometimes Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with pneumonia.
