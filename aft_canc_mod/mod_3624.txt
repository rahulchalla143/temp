History of Present Illness: 59 year old male with recurrent squamous cell lung cancer, now C1D10 of gemcitabine, last dose on [**2152-4-20**] who p/w fever and dizziness.
Onc fellow recommended he come to ER for counts to r/o febrile neutropenia.
He reports that he had fever and rigors with chemotherapy 3 days ago, was told to take tylenol.
The day of admission, he felt weak, went to sleepi nthe afternoon and t hen awoke with fever 102.3., no chills or rigors.
He denies any change in cough or sputum production ??????
only basein occaisonal thin white sputum- Sob at baseline, no V/D, no abd pain, no dysuria, no rashes, no oral ulcers.
In the ED: He was initially stable with SBP 116/76 but then developed tachycardiac to 120's and eventually hypotension to SBP 70's.
In addition, no lateral ST depressions were noted in V4-V6; cardiac enzymes negative in the ED.
Past Medical History:  PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: ====================== ONC: squamous cell lung cancer T3, N2 s/p L pneumonectomy [**2-/2151**] after chemo and XRT; bronchoscopy on [**12-22**] revealed erythema and abnormal appearance in the L bronchial stump suggesting recurrent disease.
Recent PET shows some FDG avidity along the pneumonectomy suture line with a comment about a foci of avidity in the AP window area.
There is also circumferential uptake around the pneumonectomy cavity.
There is also a note of poor anatomic delineation without a contrast CT.
There was also FDG avidity between the right atrial appendage and the left ventricular outflow track without anatomic correlate.
No definite bony lesions, no subdiaphragmatic lesions.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ==================== - a-flutter s/p ablation in [**11/2151**]; not anticoagulated [**1-17**] bleeding problems while on coumadin for PE in the past - PE [**11-20**] - multiple PNAs, most recently in [**12-24**] (as above) - + PPD, treated with INH x8 months (completed in [**4-21**]) - COPD: FEV1 of 1.55 liters or 48% of predicted, an FVC of 2.38  liters or 53% of predicted, and an FEV1/FVC ratio of 55% - Pulmonary embolism [**11/2150**] - L frozen shoulder   Social History: Patient is divorced and lives with his two daughters.
Only rare alcohol use and prior tobacco use (roughly 70 pack years); he quit smoking approximately a year ago just prior to be diagnosed with lung cancer.
Physical Exam: GENERAL: NAD SKIN: warm and well perfused, no excoriations or lesions, no rashes HEENT: no JVD, no LAD, no oral ulcers or lesions CARDIAC: RRR, S1/S2, no mrg LUNG: bilateral high picked end expiratory wheeze ABDOMEN: nondistended, +BS, nontender in all quadrants, no rebound/guarding, no hepatosplenomegaly M/S: moving all extremities well, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, no obvious deformities PULSES: 2+ DP pulses bilaterally NEURO: CN II-XII intact  Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS:  [**2152-4-22**] 10:25PM   WBC-7.2 RBC-4.06* HGB-11.1* HCT-32.7* MCV-81* MCH-27.4 MCHC-34.0 RDW-16.7* [**2152-4-22**] 10:25PM   NEUTS-89.7* LYMPHS-7.9* MONOS-0.6* EOS-1.5 BASOS-0.4 [**2152-4-22**] 10:25PM   PLT COUNT-181 [**2152-4-22**] 10:25PM   PT-15.1* PTT-31.2 INR(PT)-1.3*  [**2152-4-22**] 10:25PM   GLUCOSE-134* UREA N-14 CREAT-0.9 SODIUM-136 POTASSIUM-4.2 CHLORIDE-104 TOTAL CO2-21* ANION GAP-15 [**2152-4-22**] 10:30PM   LACTATE-2.9* K+-3.1*  ADMISSION CXR ([**2152-4-22**]): 1.
Patchy nodular densities within the right lower lung, likely reflect residual infection, as seen on chest CT [**2152-4-7**].
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
The diffuse abnormalities may be due to pulmonary edema, especially given a new small right pleural effusion, but diffuse infection is also possible.
Right middle lobe and other peribronchial opacities slightly increased, likely infectious, but attention to this region should be paid on subsequent followups.
Unchanged left basilar pleural nodules, suggestive of pleural metastases.
Stable old left humeral bone infarct or enchondroma.
There is evidence of widespread patchy change in the right lung, which is nonspecific, but as mentioned before could reflect toxic drug damage ,edema or infection.
The nodular pattern may be misleading given the widespread emphysematous change present.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 yo male with pmh of recurrent squamous cell lung carcinoma s/p left pneumonectomy in [**2-20**] now s/p cycle one of gemcitabine (last on [**2152-4-20**]) who presented on [**4-23**] with fevers and hypotension possibly be secondary to Gemcitabine-related inflammatory lung disease.
# Sepsis/Hypoxia:  Felt to be most likely related to gemcitabine-related inflammatory lung disease.
# Atrial fibrillation: During this hospitalization he was in sinus rhythm.
He is not systemically anticoagulated due to problems with bleeding in the past.
# Anemia:  Likely from bone marrow suppression from chemotherapy.
He had no clinical evidence of bleeding.
# Squamous cell carcinoma: Patient is s/p neoadjuvant cisplatin and etoposide with concomitant radiation completed [**2151-1-13**] for squamous cell lung cancer s/p left pneumonectomy on [**2151-3-4**] and s/p first dose of palliative Taxotere on [**2-3**].
Oxazepam 10 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary - Hypotension Fevers Hypoxia Possible gemcitabine-related inflammatory lung disease  Secondary - Squamous cell lung cancer History of atrial flutter Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease   Discharge Condition: Stable, satting 93 % with ambulation on 6 L of NC.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital due to fevers and low blood pressure.
You were thought to have developed a reaction to gemcitabine which caused your symptoms.
Call your primary doctor, or go to the emergency room if you experience fevers, chills, dizziness, worsening shortness of breath, return of your original symptoms, or other worrisome symptoms.
