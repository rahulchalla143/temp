Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 110150**] Admission Date: [**2120-6-18**] Discharge Date: [**2120-6-24**] Date of Birth:  [**2079-6-5**] Sex:  F Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, the patient is a 41- year-old woman with a recurrent abdominal wall mass presumed to be a desmoid tumor recurrence following resection in [**2112**] and [**2113**] of left rectus/epigastric mass that developed over the past 8 years; according to the patient and her husband has been slowly growing.
Workup included a [**2120-1-21**] CAT scan which demonstrated a 2- x 2.6- x 4.4-cm ill-defined enhancing mass in the left rectus concerning for recurrent desmoid which was not noted on a [**2117**] scan.
A subsequent [**2120-4-4**] MRI demonstrated a 1.8- x 2.6- x 5-cm enhancing mass within the left upper anterior abdominal wall of the rectus muscle very likely to represent recurrence in this region.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for anemia secondary to uterine fibroids with hematocrit's recently noted to be in the low 30s.
It was believed that no hysterectomy was indicated at this time by her gynecologist, blindness secondary to a dent of the optic nerve.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for a [**2112**] right abdominal wall desmoid resection and reconstruction by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of the plastic surgery service, a chest wall right desmoid recurrence (status post resection in [**2113-5-12**]), multiple hernia repairs (most recently on [**2120-1-25**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] which also included an abdominoplasty with Marlex and mesh repair by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
STUDIES:  On [**2120-4-4**] a MRI showed a 1.8- x 2.6- x 5-cm enhancing mass within the left upper anterior abdominal wall and rectus muscle.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was noted to be an obese African-American female in no acute distress.
Her neck with no adenopathy.
There were no thyroid masses.
She had a 4+ carotids with no bruits.
Her coronary exam showed a regular rate and rhythm without gallops or murmurs.
Her abdomen was noted to have a soft tissue muscle palpable 6.6- x  9-cm mass attached to the left lower ribs with no deep abdominal masses or hernias.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted electively and underwent an en bloc resection of the left rectus muscle for recurrent desmoid tumor as well as a left inferior rib resection as well as ventral hernia repair by placement of an inlay mesh.
While the patient tolerated the procedure well, upon awakening from anesthesia the patient had a brief hypoxic event.
Other than these 2 minor complications the patient had a rather uncomplicated postsurgical course.
RECURRENT DESMOID TUMOR: Following resection of this mass    the patient's wound was managed by both the general    surgery service and thoracic surgery service, and the    wound was noted throughout her admission to be clean, dry,    and intact with no signs or symptoms of infection.
This was subsequently converted to oral    pain medication in the form of Percocet and this provided    adequate anesthesia.
A    postoperative chest x-ray showed no pneumothorax and only    left-sided atelectasis.
On the night of postoperative day    #2, however, the patient was initially noted to be    tachycardic in the early morning hours of [**2120-6-19**];    and then at approximately 2:45 a.m. the patient was noted    to become unresponsive with oxygen saturations in the 60s,    bradycardic, with a palpable pulse.
On their    recommendation an additional MRI/MRA of the brain was    obtained, and this study also showed no evidence of    intracranial hemorrhage or acute territorial infarction.
However, no clear etiology    - neurologic or otherwise - was discovered for this event.
The neurology service doubted it was a seizure, stroke, or    other neurologic phenomenon.
The patient had at least 1 set of    negative cardiac enzymes as well as EKGs that were not    consistent with ischemia; and thus, the tachycardia was    deemed not to be significant and resolved on its own.
Recurrent desmoid tumor.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was discharged with Percocet 1 to 2 tablets by mouth every 4-6 hours, Colace 100 mg 1 capsule twice a day as needed (for constipation), Milk of Magnesia 30 mL every 6 hours as needed (for constipation), and iron sulfate 325 mg 1 tablet twice a day.
