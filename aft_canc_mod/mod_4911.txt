Admission Date:  [**2117-6-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-6-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2030-12-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9160**] Chief Complaint: Weakness and falls  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD   History of Present Illness: The patient is an 86 year old male with multiple medical issues including previously treated follicular lymphoma, diastolic CHF, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, COPD no longer on home O2, and CKD who was admitted to OSH on [**2117-6-6**] with weakness and falls at home.
On that admission, he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with labs notable for CK 500-600s, Calcium 12.5, PTH not elevated, Creatinine 1.4, and HCT 27 (baseline in mid 30s).
His head CT head showed no acute process.

He was recently being evaluated here for possible Nissen fundoplication, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of his anemia and hypercalcemia.
On reaching the floor, he reported some recent dyspnea on exertion and dizziness when standing.
He denied any other acute complaints.
He notes that his activiy level has been declining, and he no longer likes to walk around his home due to fatigue and dyspnea.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea, or congestion.
Denies chest pain, pressure, tightness, or palpitations.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain.

# Father: Tuberculosis # Sister: Unsure how she is doing.
Left pupil slightly smaller than right but both reactive to light.
No cervical lymphadenopathy.
No carotid bruits noted.
Coarse breath sounds and few scattered crackles without focal findings.
No organomegaly or masses.
Skin: No rashes, ulcers, or other lesions noted.
No pronator drift.
OP - moist w/ brownish plaque on tongue Neck: JVP not elevated.
soft systolic murmur across precordium.
No organomegaly or masses.
The known left apical mass is obliterated by the soft tissues of the neck.
Unchanged evidence of moderate cardiomegaly with moderate pulmonary edema and signs of interstitial fluid overload.
Presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
No newly appeared parenchymal opacities.
Left apical mass, substantially progressed since [**2117-3-21**] and chest radiograph from [**2117-1-17**], progressing into the neck with multiple pulmonary metastases and liver hypodensities, highly concerning for metastatic disease.
Unusual appearance of the left kidney, partially imaged with this technique which is not tailored for evaluation of renal disease.
If clinically warranted, correlation with ultrasound or dedicated CT or MR might be considered.
Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION: ==================================== Mr. [**Known lastname 88299**] is an 86 year old male with multiple medical issues including previously treated follicular lymphoma, paraesophageal hernia, diastolic CHF, afib, COPD who was admitted to OSH on [**2117-6-6**] with weakness and falls, during workup at [**Hospital1 18**] found to have new diagnosis of metastatic cancer likely from the lung.
ACTIVE ISSUES: ================== # L upper lung malignancy (Pancoast tumor): Discovered on work-up of hypercalcemia with CT scan on [**6-13**].
# Coffee ground emesis in setting of GERD with paraesophageal hernia: Pt began to experience symptoms during [**Date range (1) 88300**].
Differential included gastritis, GERD causing upper GI bleed, hiatal hernia (ulceration/gastritis/erosions), cancer metastasis invading into upper GI mucosa, gastric outlet obstruction, or tumor impinging on the emesis nerve tract (i.e.
Sucralfate and PPI were given to treat upper GI bleed.
Pt was recently undergoing evaluation by Thoracic Surgery for repair of a large paraesophageal hernia - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was peripherally involved in goals of care discussions and decided not to operate in light of patient's current clinical status and risk of possibly reducing the patient's quality of life post-operatively and inability to wean off the ventilator.
- Continue PPI and sucralfate for comfort - Standing tylenol and fentanyl patch for pain control.
Hydromorphone PRN for breakthrough pain.
- Anti-emetics as needed for comfort (promethazine and zofran)  # Dyspnea in setting of aspiration pneumonitis: Complicated by untreated COPD, hiatal hernia, and pulmonary mass causing pulmonary compression from mass effect.
- Continue Oxygen as needed for comfort  # Weakness and Falls: His recent weakness and falls are most likely multifactorial.
His recent fall may have been related to atrial fibrillation, weakness from hypercalcemia or anemia, and mechanical fall from tripping.
His hypercalcemia is likely related to new malignancy given his known history of follicular lymphoma, ongoing anemia, and elevated LDH.
No further interventions were done since hypercalcemia did not appear to be symptomatic.
Most likely from hiatal hernia affecting diaphragm or mass pushing on vagus nerve.
Can stop if patient is over-sedated or hiccups resolve.
# Left Hand/Arm Pain: Most likely from brachial plexus compression from pancoast tumor.
- Standing tylenol and fentanyl patch for pain control.
Hydromorphone PRN for breakthrough pain.
CHRONIC ISSUES: ================== # Chronic Diastolic CHF: Throughout his stay he appeared euvolemic with minimal LE edema or crackles.
# Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: He was initially in AFib at OSH, which may have precipitated his recent weakness and falls.
Aspirin was discontinued in setting of GI bleed.
If patient is having symptomatic palpitations, could consider restarting metoprolol in the future.
# Hypertension: He was somewhat hypertensive on arrival, most likely due to his pain.
Medications on Admission: Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY  - on hold x months Metoprolol Tartrate 50 mg PO TID Hydralazine 20 mg PO TID Furosemide 40 mg PO DAILY - on hold x months Isosorbide Mononitrate ER 30 mg PO DAILY Levothyroxine (LEVOXYL) 50 mcg PO DAILY Omeprazole 20 mg PO BID -- unsure why two PPIs Sucralfate 1 gram PO Q6H Colace 100 mg PO BID PRN constipation Multivitamin 1 tab PO DAILY  Discharge Medications: 1. hydromorphone 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q3H (every 3 hours) as needed for pain.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 88299**],  You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of falls, weakness, and high calcium levels.
