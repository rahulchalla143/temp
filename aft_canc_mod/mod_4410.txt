[**2192-3-20**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Streaky left base opacity, developing/early pneumonia not excluded.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
[**2192-3-22**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Small bilateral pleural effusions.
No evidence of focal consolidation.
[**2192-3-22**] right rib film: IMPRESSION: No evidence for rib fracture.
No pneumothorax.
Ill defined area of hypodensity along the left of the oropharnx extending to involve the left aryepiglottic fold with medialization of the left aryepiglottic fold and with compressive effect on the air way, appears consistent with edema/phlegmonous change.
No definite rim of enhancement.
No retropharyngeal edema seen.
Atherosclerotic calcification and thrombus involving the cervical portion the right internal carotid artery (series 2, 45) which appears asymmetrically narrowed when compared to the left.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 y/o M undergoing chemo for rectal CA (not currently neutropenic) p/w throat pain and fever found with parapharyngeal phlegmon compressing airway.
#Sepsis - Patient presented with tachycardia and fever with known source (paratracheal phlegmon).
#Paratracheal phlegmon- CT revealed L parapharyngeal phlegmon without a drainable collection.
He was monitored closely for evidence of stridor, and also on continuous O2 monitoring.
Pain was controlled with acetaminophen and oxycodone as needed initially but at discharge he did not require any pain medications.
#Hyponatremia - Na initially 130, likely secondary to hypovolemia.
Hypovolemia was likely secondary to decreased PO intake in setting of sore throat, and also from insensible losses in setting of sepsis.
Of note, his FeNA (checked in context of initial decreased urine output) was 0.55%, c/w prerenal etiology.
#Chest pain - Patient c/o 4 days of chest pain after working in the yard.
Pain was reproducible with palpation, and worse with movement.
It was most consistent with a musculoskeletal etiology.
A cardiac etiology was unlikely; EKG was without signs of ischemia and unchanged from prior.
Portable CXR showed bibasilar atelectasis and no pneumonia.
Formal PA/lateral CXR showed no infiltrate.
Rib films showed no signs of fracture.
His pain improved with warm compresses.
#Metastatic rectal cancer - On admission, patient not neutropenic although he is immunosuppressed.
Noted to have bony metastases on previous MRI to lumbar, sacral, and cervical spine.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for further evaluation of sore throat and fevers.
You were found to have a parapharyngeal phlegmon and were started on antibiotics.
There was no need for drainage.
You also had some chest pain which was thought to be musculoskeletal pain and improved with warm packs.
Your chest x-rays showed small pleural effusions and an opacity that is likely just atelectasis.
There was no evidence of pneumonia.
