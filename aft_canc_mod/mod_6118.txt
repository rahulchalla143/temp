Admission Date:  [**2158-3-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-4-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2103-4-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3223**] Chief Complaint:  transverse [**First Name3 (LF) 499**] CA  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**3-2**] s/p transverse colectomy [**3-6**] s/p ex lap, R colectomy, end ileostomy, Hartmann's procedure  [**3-15**] s/p Perc Chole placement, drainage of subhepatic fluid collection [**3-22**] extubated [**3-20**] R Pleural Eff tap   History of Present Illness: This was a 54-year-old woman with a several month history of intermittent hematochezia.
A preoperative colonoscopy demonstrated an ulcerated mass in the mid transverse [**Month/Year (2) 499**].
Biopsies demonstrated adenocarcinoma of uncertain depth.
The patient had a substantial history of alcohol ingestion with an enlarged liver on physical examination.
Her preoperative liver function tests were significant only for mild elevation of her transaminases.
A preoperative CT scan of the torso demonstrated no evidence of metastasis.
She did not have any findings suggestive of portal hypertension.
She had no ascites or carcinomatosis.
Resection of her tumor was advised and accepted.
[**3-5**] Torso CT scan: no PE, moderate bilateral pleural effusions, s/p transverse colectomy, with apparently intact anastomotic site and no large fluid collection around anastomotic site, increasing pneumoperitoneum, no evidence of obstruction or breakdown at the anastomotic site.
NO extravasation of contrast, though extraluminal air adjacent to the suture at the apex of the pouch has increased since [**3-14**], raising concern for a leak at the apex of the pouch.
unchanged bilateral pleural effusions, There has been a very mild increase in fluid in the lesser sac.
[**3-19**] CT Thorax: Moderate size simple bliateral effusions with associated compressive atelectasis, slightly decreased from prior.
No evidence for loculations.
[**3-27**] B/L LENI: No DVT .
[**4-9**] CXR: Moderate bilateral pleural effusions larger on the left side and associated with atelectasis are unchanged.
There is no pulmonary edema.
There is no pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: On [**2158-3-2**] a transverse colectomy was performed without complication.
On POD#2, Pt became SOB, which was worse lying completely flat, and kept her from taking deep breaths.
Patient had increasing O2 requirement, cxr showed edema, no diuresis was done.
Pt also admits cough w/ occasional sputum -clear, and fevers/chills.
On POD#3 (day of transfer to ICU), respiratory distress worsened with increasing O2 requirements to nc and face mask to keep sats >95%.
54yoF pod #3 from transverse colectomy, hx pad, emphysema, ethanol abuse, transferred for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
Hypoxemic respiratory failure- started POD#2, with hypoxia on NC.
Pt may have become fluid overloaded s/p 4u PRBC.
Pt shows moderate pleural effusions that were not present on the CT scan on [**2-22**].
Infection unlikely w/o wbc and infiltrate on CT. Pt also shows atalectasis that may be contributing.
Pt beginning to become hypotensive, .
- vanco/zosyn - serial lactates - serial abd exams .
Pt also became agitated and given sedative, and needed to be on Assist, now back on pressure support at 15.
At 6am pt was -1.2L and given another 10 IV lasix at 6am - swab from fluid- speciation back: growing E.coli, Klebsiella - pan-sensitive - tbili coming down ________________________________________ [**3-12**] - Started lasix gtt because the pt was hypotensive this am in the setting of sedation and bolused lasix - Got 50ml albumin for hypotension - Started fentanyl gtt in order to get the pt off benzos as there is some concern for worsening MS in the setting of Versed  ________________________________________ [**3-13**] - Repeatedly febrile, although BP and HR stable.
Line sent for culture - Surgery opened surgical site and drained some purulent material.
- Diuresing well, PM lytes stable ________________________________________ [**3-14**] - Around 4pm pt became febrile to 101.2 and tachycardic to 120s (previously never tachycardic).
- Pt?????
suggesting incr dead spacing, and pt was concerning for PE.
- Pt?????
Given hypoxia and tachycardia w/ new dead spacing decision was made to attempt CTA for PE.
- new CXR showed no new infiltrates and was unchanged.
agreed to adding Flagyl 500 IV q8, and surgery contd to want to r/o PE - bladder pressure 19 - stable - Pt became hypotensive to sbp 70s, map 40s, and gave 1L bolus, w/ 1unit PRBC being transfused during that time.
- Pt?????
Fluid sent for GS and Cx - Perc drain of loculated subdiaphragmatic fluid (LUQ), fluid sent for GS and Cx - Per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] plan for ex lap on [**3-17**], pt's family consented by [**Doctor Last Name 519**] and anesthesia - Repeat Hct 25, [**Doctor First Name **] asked for transfusion - D/c'ed left art line, placed new right radial art line ________________________________________ [**3-16**] - repeat CT scan with rectal, PO and IV contrast without significant change in air collection near hartmanns pouch - culture of peritoneal fluid drained on [**3-15**] growing GNR - deferred surgery today, reconsider tomorrow.
Per [**Doctor First Name **] give 25% albumin, hold lasix gtt, pt's pressures went to 80's systolic - ID rec'd stopping Zosyn as cx growing pan sensi E coli, but couldn't reach [**Last Name (LF) 519**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] still on Zosyn - Off lasix gtt overnight ________________________________________________ [**3-19**] - CT chest to eval pleural effusions unremarkable - present but not huge, unlikely to fix the problem but if no other ideas, can tap prior to trach - Increasing PEEP as BP and airway pressures allow to recruit more lung and assist with extubation - Changed antibiotics to PO - Overbreathing the vent, becoming alkalotic - tried pressure support to decrease minute volume but pt became tachypneic to 40s/50s and with very shallow breaths.
new consolidation on chest aspiration v pna - Started Vanc Zosyn - At MN had ~500 cc BRBPR ____________________________________________ [**3-22**] - SELF EXTUBATED at 1:30 pm (had been planned for extubation or trach at 3pm) and started saying "I don't need this tube" Continued to sat high 90s with supplemental oxygen (NC and shovel mask).
- no more fevers but bandemia from AM concerning so kept on antibiotics.
Potentially planned for CT guided drainage of abdominal collections tomorrow.
- Respiratory distress o/n with sat's to 70's, responded to bolus of lasix gtt, nebs, repositionning - 7:15 AM ([**3-23**]), tachy to 130's, hypertensive to 160's, sat's in 70's.
Lasix gtt had been held for marked hypokalemia (2.8) but was still putting out 80cc/hr urine.
- Pt alert but very agitated, tried ativan 1mg, then haldol 4mg POx1 which helped - Around 11pm, bt became tachycardic to 120s, RR 40, changed from facemask to bipap, but still 02 sat decr 90%.
____________________ [**3-24**] - Pt on bipap most of day - Stopped lasix gtt in am as pt hypotensive in 70's and symptomatic (improved in trendelenberg), did not end up getting fluid bolus.

- Continue diuresis [**3-31**] - at 4:30 in atfernoon had A fib with RVR got lopressor 2.5 IV x2 and then back in sinus -nausea not responsive to zofran but was to compazine, TF stopped because of nausea -10pm I/Os -231 -pt weaned down to 60s during early afternoon, then A fib with RVR so back up to 90s -increased free water boluses (may have gotten held when TF held) [**4-1**] Restarted TF Decreased free water boluses Switched Xopenex back to albuterol Took sips of water PO Still on shovel mask for O2 [**4-2**] - Weaned to 5L NC - Advanced TFs - Patient AO x3, coherent - d/c diamox - Increased SCH to TID - Decreased Vanco enemas to [**Hospital1 **] [**4-3**] -A fib with RVR did not respond to metoprolol 5 IV x3, converted to sinus on dilt gtt, then switched to PO dilt and PO metoprolol discontinued -surgery did not want to diurese, just wanted pt to settle out on her own -3 pm lytes repleted K+.
No signs of cardiac toxicity.
