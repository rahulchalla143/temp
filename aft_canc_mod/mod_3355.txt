No evidence of intra or extra-axial lesion in this non-contrast study.
LENIs [**2158-10-18**]: No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.
No evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax.
Unchanged moderate right hilar enlargement, with relatively diffuse and many peripheral right parenchymal opacities.
The extent of the pre-existing right pleural effusion cannot be determined given that it is not visualized.
No abnormality is seen in the left lung.
Large infiltrating right hilar mass occluding the bronchus intermedius and portions of the right middle lobe and right lower lobe proximal bronchi.
There is extensive mediastinal adenopathy including a large precarinal node, which may be contiguous with the dominant hilar mass.
Several suspicious spiculated satellite nodules are also noted within the right middle and right lower lobe with additional suspicious left lower lobe nodule.
Superimposed presumed post-obstructive bronchiolitis is seen in the right upper, right middle and right lower lobes.
Known underlying centrilobular emphysema.
Large hypoattenuating right hepatic lesion presumably site of biopsy- proven metastases.
Several subcutaneous soft tissue nodules are present which is an atypical location for lung metastases.
Several of these lesions are not located at sites typically used for subcutaneous injections.
Small right pleural effusion and trace perihepatic ascites.
Atherosclerotic disease including coronary artery calcifications.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 73953**] was a 76 year old woman with PMH of COPD on home O2 of 3L NC, HTN, CHF, IDDM, PVD with stents to bilateral legs, recently diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma with mets to the liver who presented with progressive shortness of breath requiring non-invasive ventilation at OSH and was intubated to protect her airway and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible stenting of the right bronchus intermedius as a means to potentially improve her baseline shortness of breath.
Respiratory failure: The patient had progressive shortness of breath that required noninvasive ventilation at OSH.
Her repiratory failure was in large part secondary to collapsed airway secondary to obstruction by her NSCLC.
Due to progressive oxygen requirements and poor prognosis, decision was made with her husband and children to change focus of care to comfort.
[**Location (un) 511**] organ bank was notified prior to extubation and, but unfortunately patient was not a candidate due to her malignancy and active post-obstructive pneumonia.
