The patient had noticed painless jaundice for one monthly with dark urine, pruritus, constipation and decreased appetite along with early satiety and a ten pound weight loss.
She presented for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with biopsy on [**2186-10-13**], during which an ampullary mass was noted and positive for pathology-revealing adenocarcinoma.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The procedure went as planned without any complications and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] drain was left in the right upper quadrant site near the site of her biliary anastomosis.
As a summary of these events in brief - The patient was postoperatively fluid-requiring and noticing that she was having slow oozing requiring blood products at a rate of several units a day postoperatively.
A decision was made to take the patient back to the Operating Room to look for a source of bleeding, and on [**2186-11-4**], on postoperative day #2 she underwent an exploratory laparotomy with findings consistent with a hemoperitoneum, but no evidence of any active arterial or venous bleeding.
It was thought that the patient likely had a low ooze after her operation from the posterior-SMV divided mesenteric base of the afferent limb.
Her abdomen was washed out and she was returned to the Intensive Care Unit setting still intubated on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for concern of an aspiration pneumonia.
On postoperative day #10 it was noticed that her [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] output had become bilious and Octreotide was restarted and her lines were changed.
Total parenteral nutrition was started at this time and she was pancultured with all cultures later revealing no growth.
On postoperative day #12, the patient underwent a swallow study to assess her swallowing ability and she aspirated thin liquids and failed the study.
On postoperative day #13, the patient underwent a video swallow study revealing aspiration of thin liquids that reversed with postural maneuvers in a chin tuck.
The patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day #12 on Zosyn for Serratia that grew out of the sputum on [**2186-11-7**] and she was continued on her total parenteral nutrition because of slow p.o.
At this time the patient remained very deconditioned and weak status post her two operations and she was found to have marginal mental status where she was able to understand questions but had trouble responding with speech which she attributes to a dry mouth.
A neurology consult was obtained on postoperative day #12 and revealed no focal findings, but they found that likely etiologic agents involved generalized weakness and deconditioning in addition to intervascular dehydration.
A computerized tomography scan of the head was performed which revealed no stroke or hemorrhage.
A follow up magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed only mild to moderate atherosclerotic changes of the cavernous portion of her right internal carotid artery, but otherwise normal.
On postoperative day #13, a computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed because of persistently elevated white count in the low 20s.
This computerized tomography scan revealed fluid collection in her mid abdomen which was concerning for an abscess, persistent bilateral pleural effusions, ascites and extensive subcutaneous edema.
40 cc of dark bloody material was successfully drained by IR and this later grew out [**Female First Name (un) 564**].
Additionally, on this day the patient underwent a right thoracentesis for her right pleural effusion and under ultrasound guidance the interventional radiologist was able to successfully drain 650 cc of clear straw-colored fluid.
On postoperative day #14, Methicillin-sensitive resistant Staphylococcus aureus swabs of her rectum and nasal cavities revealed Methicillin-sensitive resistant Staphylococcus aureus and at this time Zosyn was changed to Vancomycin.
She also underwent a left thoracentesis for 450 cc of clear fluid with her postoperative chest x-ray revealing no evidence of pneumothorax.
About four hours after returning from her left thoracentesis the house officer was emergently called as the patient had experienced question hemoptysis versus hematemesis where the nurse noted 50 cc of bright red blood coming out of the patient's mouth.
The patient denied any shortness of breath or difficulty breathing but was found to have an oxygen saturation that had decreased to the low 80s and high 70s with hypotension of 100/50.
The patient was placed on a nonrebreather of 100% and emergently transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where a hematocrit showed a drop from 30 to 24.
It revealed dark red blood just distal to the surgical anastomosis with erythematous, edematous, friable small intestinal loop just beyond her anastomosis which all suggested ischemia of her anastomosis.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was also significant for an ulcer in the lesser curvature.
After a discussion, the decision was made that the patient would be Do-Not-Resuscitate, Do-Not-Intubate without any further operative interventions, and that her gastrointestinal bleed would be managed medically with transfusions of red cells as necessary.
She required no further transfusions, but her wound was opened revealing thick biliary secretions on top of a small bed of necrotic tissue, therefore the wound was packed with wet to dry dressings t.i.d.
6 hours for tachycardia and hypertension, but once she was able to take p.o.
The Zoloft was started at this time, as the patient was exhibiting symptoms of depression.
Additionally marked erythema was noted on the right lateral side of her abdomen over her extensive subcutaneous edema.
Her erythema had stabilized on broad-spectrum antibiotics and her white count had eventually decreased from the low 20s.
Her wound appeared much better after vacuum-assisted closure device and required occasional debridement prior to vacuum-assisted closure dressing changes.
Additionally the patient began to auto-diuresing at this time, being 1 liter to 1.5 liters negative per day and her whole body total edema had tremendously improved.
Her right lateral erythema had virtually resolved and her total body edema had much decreased after her auto diuresis for the past four days.
Her vacuum-assisted closure dressing was changed on the day of discharge by surgical house officers who noted that the wound continued to heal well.
