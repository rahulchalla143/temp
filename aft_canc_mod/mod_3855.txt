He was cared for on the surgical service where he received transfusions prn and his pain was controlled.
He continued to be neutropenic and was kept on voriconazole/cefepime/levo for his lung process.
He was severely edematous when transfered from the surgical service, developed renal failure, presumably secondary to the MVA, and this exacerbated his edema.
He developed mild respiratory distress and became oxygen dependent.
However, the mental status depression became more profound and he became less conversant with family and responsive to commands.
