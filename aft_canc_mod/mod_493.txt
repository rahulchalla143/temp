He reports 2-3 months of BRBPR and clots which he had attributed to hemorrhoids.
This gradually transitioned to dark stools and now tarry, black stools in the past few days.
Over this time, he has had increasing fatigue and dyspnea on exertion.
Today, he felt very weak and had chest pressure and heart-racing with walking less than 10 feet so came to the ED for evaluation.
The patient provides a longstanding history of intermittent, sharp lower abdominal pain for which he was given the diagnosis of IBS.
Multiple endoscopies over 10 years ago were unrevealing, and symptoms improved with stress and diet control.
About 10 years ago, he had one episode of bright red hematemesis and recalls being diagnosed with an ulcer; he does not recall an endoscopy at that time.
In the past couple months, he has noted worsening of his chronic abdominal pain after eating as well as increased nausea, heartburn, and bloating requiring frequent Tums.
He denies taking NSAIDs, but his pain is especially exacerbated by coffee (3 cups/week) and alcohol (2 beers last Saturday - first in 5 years).
Exam notable for guaiac positive black stools.
He triggered for tachycardia; EKG showed sinus tachycardia with ST depressions in V3-V6.

Family History: Father with multiple medical problems including MI s/p CABG in his 60s.
Maternal grandfather with unknown cancer.
Maternal uncle recently diagnosed with metastatic cancer, primary unclear.

The CT of the abdomen and pelvis performed several hours later excludes the presence of pleural effusions.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2122-5-29**]: IMPRESSION: Long segment gastroduodenal intussusception, with two large submucosal masses in the fourth portion of the duodenum.
Brief Hospital Course: 38 year-old man with a history of IBS and PUD presenting with hematochezia and symptomatic anemia.
He was admitted to the medical ICU and resuscitated for his GI bleed.
He had a CT which was concerning for gastroduodenal intussusception.
An EGD confirmed this condition, and demonstrated a 5cm mass in the duodenum.
A transverse duodenotomy was performed, revealing a polypoid mass with a 10cm stalk connecting the mass to its origin just distal to the pylorus.
Overnight into POD#2, he became achycardic to the low 110's, but was asymptomatic and otherwise hemodynamically stable.
He did not have any bloody NG output or melenic stools.
His tachycardia continued into the morning of POD#2, and his hematocrit was 16.5 on morning labs.
At that time, he complained of some palpitations, but otherwise felt fine.
He never had any evidence of ongoing bleeding during this time, but was perhaps equilibrating perioperatively.
The patient was advanced to a regular diet on POD#8 without issue, his nausea resolved and his hematocrit was serially checked and remained stable around 30% without further requirement for transfusion.
Organized collection of hyperplastic submucosal Brunner glands consistent with Brunner gland nodule with central foci of ischemic necrosis.
Overlying mucosa with gastric foveolar metaplasia consistent with chronic injury.
No dysplasia or true neoplasm identified; see note.
Gallbladder, cholecystectomy (B): Mild chronic cholecystitis.
Note:  Brunner gland nodules are best considered to be hamartomatous lesions.
