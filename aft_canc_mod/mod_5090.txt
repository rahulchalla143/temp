She was found to have a circumferential area of stenosis below the cricoid cartilage extending 6cm; it was not felt to be granulation tissue.
A CT scan was done which showed that she had: -Focal tracheal stenosis at the inferior extent of the tracheostomy tube.
-There was also: proximal narrowing which may relate to granulation tissue versus secretions.
-Polypoid soft tissue density just above the insertion of the tracheostomy tube may relate to granulation tissue.
On [**2156-7-4**], she was then admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with SOB and desatted to the low 90s.
She was found on HOD #2 to have Enterococcus bacteremia - via Cx x 2 on [**7-4**] and Cx x 2 on [**7-5**].
(A TTE was negative for vegetations.
They added on Gent once her urine culture came back positive for Klebsiella UTI.
On [**7-19**], she was obtunded and had significant mucous secretions and mucus plugging requiring suctioning; ENT changed her cuffless trach from a #6 to a #4 and transitioned to a trach collar after transient ventilation.
On [**7-22**], noticed to have "mild stridor" and mild tachypnea and was replaced on a ventilator.

Left internal jugular vascular catheter terminates in the superior vena cava, and a nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm.
There are patchy and linear areas of atelectasis at the lung bases.
There is a questionable small left pleural effusion.
TEE [**2156-7-26**] Conclusions: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.

No definite evidence for fractures.
Degenerative changes as described above.
Improving opacity in the left perihilar region could represent improving aspiration or asymmetric edema.

MICU Course: Pt followed by IP, tracheomalacia c/w subglottic granulation tissue and Mid trach stenosis.
S/P rigid bronch + excision, debridement, dilatation and trach change.
TEE negative for vegetations.
Pt back to MICU on [**8-3**] for aggressive fluid resuscitation given C-Diff colitis and poor PO intake with metabolic acidosis.
# Respiratory: **Tracheomalacia: This was noted on previous admission to [**Hospital1 18**].
- s/p laser removal of tissue x 2 in the past - on [**7-28**]: was switched from vent to trach mask and tolerated this well - on [**7-30**]: had rigid [**Last Name (un) 1066**], electrocautery and balloon dilatation of trachea and upsizing of her trach to a #7 -> Will need a special long trach which was ordered and will be available on [**8-9**].
Per IP underwent a trach change with T-tube placement on [**8-9**] without complications.
**Acinobacter/Klebsiella VAP: Started Bactrim on [**7-28**], completed 14 day course on [**8-10**] -- Continue mucinex PRN mucus buildup -- D/Cd atrovent, albuterol standing nebs -- pt was on solumedrol 60 IV BID prior to admission (unclear reason why, ?
COPD flare), and pt was started on taper on [**2156-7-25**] and completed taper without any difficulties .
# ID:  Pt had hx of enteroccus bacteremia, which was believed to be treated adequately with 23 day course of vanc at OSH.
Pt had dirty UA on admission here, but urine cx only grew yeast.
Attempted to contact [**Name (NI) 336**] to obtain records of antimicrobial succeptibilities of sternal infections and bacteremias in past.
Sternal wound infection was Staph and Proteus per surgical summary.
Pt had hx of C.dif, and was continued on flagyl for additional 14 day course.
Pt had low grade temps during her MICU stay (with a Tmax of 100.5), but did not have a significant temp spike.
She then had explosive diarrhea with +C-diff in stools.
She had persistent diarrhea, resistent to PO flagyl treatment, she was started on PO Vanco as well as IV flagyl on [**8-2**] for C-diff colitis.
ID again reconsulted for persistent diarrhea and elevated WBC.
Per ID she was to continue PO Vanco/flagyl until all other Antibiotics d/c'd and diarrhea improved.
She remained afebrile with improving WBC and no new culture data.
She remained afebrile with improving WBC and no new culture data at time of discharge.
C-DIFF Colitis: pt with explosive diarrhea treated for C-diff as noted above.
However, notable for small bowel obstruction on [**2156-8-4**].
# Neuro: Seizure Prophylaxis - on phenytoin (likely since she had subdural sustained in [**4-29**])  - continued phenytoin during this admission, increased dose given low albumin and subtherapeutic with corrected dose.
She did not have any siezure activity while hospitalized.
- CT from OSH revealed mass in supracisternal region on R and patient notes that she has had changes in vision in her R eye - specificially she notes seeing random objects since her fall.
Pt had R homonymous hemianopsia and was to follow up with neuroopthamology.
restarted her on carbergoline for her prolactinoma.
- pituitary tumor is a prolactinoma and measures approx 5cm x 2.5cm x 3cm .
# Renal: - Cr 1.5 on admission; this is similar to level when she left [**Hospital1 46**] - Renally dose medications -> increaed Cr on [**7-31**] with peak to 2.4 due to poor PO intake and explosive diarrhea.
Renal followed pt, found no muddy brown casts, ARF c/w prerenal etiology also ATN in setting of poor forward flow.
Her IVF were discontinued on [**8-9**] as she was significantly volume overloaded and making urine, although poorly ~700cc per day.
Metabolic Acidosis: Pt with explosive diarrhea with low bicarb.
However, she also developed hyponatremia with IVF resuscitation.
Her SBP was stable at time of discharge SBP 115. d/c'd HCTZ during this admission, due to borderline low BP and likely need for BB in the future .
# DM2:  Her BS was persistently elevated while she was on steroids.
# GERD: continued PPI .
# [**Month/Year (2) **]:  PPI, fondaparinaux for DVT [**Name (NI) **] (pt has hx of HIT).
# FEN:  Pt grossly volume overloaded.
Note on [**7-29**]: had FEES study by speech/swallow team -> OK to have nectar thick liquids and ground solids, however changed diet to clear liq due to colitis.
