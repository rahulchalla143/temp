Admission Date:  [**2155-8-24**]       Discharge Date:  [**2155-8-28**]   Service: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 84-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction and questionable history of lung carcinoma who was transferred from her nursing home on [**8-24**] with a home referral form, the patient had a week of increasing shortness of breath and productive cough of clear sputum prior to her presentation at this hospital.
She has been afebrile with O2 saturations ranging from 89% to 95% on her usual home O2 requirement of 3 liters.
She was transferred to [**Doctor First Name **] to the Emergency Room, the patient was noted to be in respiratory failure with an arterial blood gas of 7.14/143/81.
She was given nitropaste, morphine and Lasix for congestive heart failure and eventually started on nitroglycerin GTT.
The patient was started on Solu-Medrol for possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, Levaquin and Flagyl for likely postobstructive disease versus aspiration pneumonia and transferred to the MICU.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 2.
Hypertension 3.
Hypercholesterolemia 4.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease 6.
Congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction 8.
History of lung carcinoma, possibly no diagnostic biopsies or cytology 9.
KCL 40 milliequivalents q day  ALLERGIES:  THE PATIENT HAS A QUESTIONABLE SENSITIVITY TO CODEINE.
GENERAL:  The patient is an alert, cooperative, elderly female in mild to moderate respiratory distress.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  The patient has cataracts bilaterally.
LUNGS:  Significant for extremely coarse breath sounds bilaterally with bibasilar crackles.
HEART:  Significant for muffled heart sounds and difficult to appreciate given the claim of the breath sounds.
There is decreased distal pulses on the right.
An electrocardiogram was obtained in the Emergency Room which showed elevated T-waves in the V2 to V4 leads consistent with prior electrocardiograms and no acute ST or T-wave changes.
A chest x-ray showed progression of right middle lobe and right lower lobe opacification with obscuration of the right heart border and right diaphragm, likely right effusion compared with the previous film from [**2155-4-29**].
It was thought that the patient's respiratory failure was likely multifactorial with pneumonia, congestive heart failure and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
The patient was given Lasix 100 mg intravenous in the Emergency Room as stated above and in the MICU an additional dose of 100 mg intravenous was given to fix the possible congestive heart failure.
The plan was to continue the supportive care while continuing treatment of her pneumonia, but not to restart BIPAP or resuscitate or intubate this patient if she were to decompensate.
Her lung exam at the time of discharge is still extremely junky and the patient's bicarbonate at the time of discharge is still elevated at 35.
It is likely that the patient still has a respiratory acidosis secondary to CO2 retention and a compensating metabolic alkalosis, but an arterial blood gas was not indicated at this time, as the patient had been symptomatically improving.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Aspiration pneumonia versus postobstructive pneumonia                                 [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1895**], M.D.
