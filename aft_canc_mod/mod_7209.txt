Briefly, 47 y/o man with long standing history of epilepsy s/p right temporal lobectomy (at age 19) and VNS placement (7 years ago), h/o EtOH and cocaine abuse who was having increased seizure frequency in the setting of VNS malfunction.
The procedure went without complication.
Overnight he developed AF with RVR to the 180s with hypotension to the 80s.
He received 2mg IV ativan with somnolence and apenea afterwards.
His MICU course was notable for an echocardiogram which showed a large pericardial effusion on [**1-29**].
450cc of bloody pericardial fluid was drained.
Patient developed SVT in the cath lab and was treated with 9 mg IV metoprolol.
On arrival, patient complained of spinal back pain from lying on the operating table.
He also reports that his lungs feel "collapsed" but denied shortness of breath.

L calf TTP, no swelling or cords noted.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Depressed LVEF.
MITRAL VALVE: No MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
No RA diastolic collapse.
No RV diastolic collapse.
Echocardiographic patient.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
LV systolic function appears mildly depressed.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion (greatest anteriorly and best seen in the subcostal view).
No right atrial diastolic collapse is seen.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen (mild RV compression in the subcostal view is suggestive of elevated intrapericardial pressure).
Cardiac cath [**1-29**]: COMMENTS: Under fluoroscopic guidance, 450 CC of bloody pericardial fluid was obtained through subxiphoid approach.
Intrapericardial origin of fluid was confirmed with contrast injection and intrapericardial pressure measurement.
Initial pericardial pressure was elevated at 21 mm Hg and dropped to 3 mm Hg after remorval of fluid.
Successful urgent pericardiocentesis through subxiphoid approach for impending pericardial temponade .
ECHO [**2196-1-30**] IMPRESSION: Small amount of echodense pericardial material/fluid is seen.
No evidence of tamponade.
Probable regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Moderately dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
The basal to mid inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis was probably present in [**2194**] but image quality is poor on all studies.
There is non-occlusive thrombus in the mid left popliteal vein and left peroneal veins, as well as the right posterior tibial vein.
The bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and right popliteal veins demonstrated normal compressibility and wall-to-wall color flow.
IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive thrombus in left popliteal, left peroneal, and right posterior tibial veins.
Pulmonary embolism involving right lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] posterior basal segmental and subsegmental branches, and subsegmental branch of left lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] anterior basal pulmonary artery.
Bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
Evidence of right heart strain, manifest as reflux of IV contrast into the IVC and hepatic veins.
Mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy with right hilar soft tissue causing some narrowing of the airways and vessels, concerning for malignancy.
Perifissural consolidation in posteromedial right middle [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] represent atelectasis or infection; however, underlying tumor or extension of right hilar mass not excluded.
11 mm spiculated nodule in the right upper [**First Name3 (LF) 3630**] is suspicious for malignancy.
Tiny pericardial fluid and possible pericardial thickening.
No evidence of malignancy in the abdomen and pelvis.
Intraabdominal findings include aortic and iliac artery calcifications, colonic diverticulosis, and tiny bubble of gas within the urinary bladder, which could be due to recent catheterization (correlate clinically).
No bony destruction concerning for malignancy.
Evidence of right femoral head avascular necrosis, without significant collapse.
CT HEAD [**2-2**] No evidence of an acute intracranial process.
Postoperative changes of right temporal lobectomy.
Pathology, pericardial effusion:  POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS,   Consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma.
The right ventricular cavity is borderline dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: 47 yo M with history of epilepsy admitted for elective vagal nerve stimulator replacement, transferred to MICU for management of tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxia, found to have pericardial effusion, now s/p pericardiocentiesis with drain in place, transferred to CCU for post-operative monitoring, with frequent agitation, now found to have bilateral PEs .
# Pericardial effusion:  In the MICU, pt noted to be tachycardic with hypotension, and found to have pericardial effusion.
He underwent pericardiocentesis with drain placement with drainage of bloody fluid.
Etiology is likely malignancy given that CT torso showing RUL lung spiculated nodule.
Effusion cytology and micro showed cells c/w metastatic lung adenocarcinoma.
Drain was eventually pulled without complication and without any further hemodynamic instability.
# PE/DVT:  Pt noted to have enlarged RV on repeat echo [**1-31**], so CTA was obtained for concern of PEs which confirmed b/l subsegmental PEs.
LENIs also positive for b/l DVTs.
However, agitation persisted despite being well out of the acute withdrawal window.
Psych was consulted who felt that this was less likely to be withdrawal and instead a behavioral issue/delerium, likely in setting of supratherapeutic valproate level.
# Afib with RVR: Patient oscillates between HR of 70s ??????
170s with frequent episodes of RVR on tele, asymptomatic.
Based on old records, has a history of Afib with RVR, a flutter, was treated with diltiazem and flecainide, and was supposed to be on Metoprolol.
Increased metoprolol to 75 mg po qid standing which has controlled rate well, though still with frequent episodes of rapid ventricular response that respond to IV lopressor 5 mg x 1.
Because of continued episodes of RVR (likely in the setting of pericardial effusion and multiple PEs) pt started on diltiazem drip, weaned off and started on diltiazem ER 120 mg daily, and metoprolol changed to 200 mg of metoprolol succinate on discharge.
HR in the 60s with these changes, with short bursts of SVT to 130s prior to discharge.
h/o epilepsy and seizure activity: VNS placed and was re-activated about 1 week after placement.
Depakote ER 1250/1500/1500 and Oxcarbazepine 600 mg [**Hospital1 **] which was often given IV due to inability to take POs from agitation.
Of note there was blood around the uerethral meatus after he pulled it.
Foley dc'ed and was able to void on his own with no hematuria for remaineder of admission.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Seizure disorder Atrial fibrillation Lung adenocarcinoma, pericardial effusion Deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: You were seen in the hospital to have your vagal nerve stimulator replaced, which has been turned on again, for your seizures.
You were also found to have a very fast heart rate from your atrial fibrillation (irregular heart rate) and for this we started diltiazem and metoprolol, which slow your heart rate.
In addition, you were found to have a pericardial effusion (fluid around your heart) which is likely due to spreading of lung cancer, which was discovered on a CT scan.
You were also found to have a pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in your lung and legs) for which you were started a blood thinner.
