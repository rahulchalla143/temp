Admission Date:  [**2128-12-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-12-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2071-11-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2474**] Chief Complaint: Right hemiplegia Headache with emesis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2128-12-5**] Left craniotomy for microsurgical tumor resection and hematoma evacuation.
Intubation/extubation  CT guided liver biopsy  Left PICC placement  History of Present Illness: 55 yo M with hx renal cell carcinoma s/p nephrectomy, HTN, and HLD presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ER on [**12-4**] with R-sided hemipelgia.
On [**12-3**] patient noted some upper back discomfort and went to bed but then woke up and vomitted.
A CT head revealed a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage and a neurosurgical consult was called.
Past Medical History: Renal cell carcinoma, s/p nephrectomy approximately 5 years prior MRSA skin abscesses HTN infrarenal abdominal aneurysm diverticulosis hypercholesterolemia MVP with moderate/severe MR   Social History: lives with wife, past history of alcohol abuse, current intake unknown, has 3 children   Family History: mother with pancreatic cancer  Physical Exam: On Admission: VS; BP 153/77 P 105 RR 20  100% on vent Gen; intubated, sedated Pulm; CTA b/l CV; RRR, no murmurs Abd; soft, NT, ND Extr; no edema Neuro; unable to perform neurological assessment as patient received paralytic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] for urgent intubation and subsequent craniotomy.
Exam was notable for left gaze preference, RUQ visual field cut, plegic right arm and leg, and mild-moderate aphasia.
Upon Discharge: General: lying on back, 30 degree angle, A+Ox3 HEENT: head partially shaved/stitches from craniotomy visible, no erythema or exudate.
No scleral cterus.
Lungs: mild bibasilar rhonchi, good air movement bilaterally Abd: NABS, soft, NT, ND, no HSM Extremities: right leg in contracture-prevention device.
No edema or calf pain bilaterally.
Pertinent Results: Head CT [**12-5**]: Note is made of a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered at the left frontal lobe, difficult to precisely marginate though measuring approximately 41 x 34 x 79 mm.
Notably, this focus of hemorrhage contains  superolateral rim of frank parenchymal hemorrhage and inferomedial to this is a 26 x 64 mm ovoid collection displaying a blood-fluid level (2:23).
The included osseous structures reveal no fracture or lesion.
The visualized paranasal sinuses are notable for mucus retention cysts at the maxillary sinuses bilaterally, though most prominently on the left, as well as a small amount of circumferential mucosal thickening at the ethmoid air cells bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: Large focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage on the left as described above.
Diagnostic considerations include metastatic disease in this patient with known history of previous renal cell carcinoma, primary mass, and alternatively vascular malformations.
C-spine CT [**12-5**]: IMPRESSION: No fracture.
Multilevel DJD with Moderate canal stenosis and moderate- severe left neural foraminal narrowing.
Mild effacement of the ventral thecal sac at C5/6.
If concern exists for ligamentous and intrathecal abnormalities recommend further characterization with MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 60441**].
MRI Brain w/ & w/o [**12-6**]: Status post left frontoparietal craniectomy with post-surgical edema and hematoma at the resection site.
No evidence of metastatic disease.
No evidence of new hemorrhage or infarction.
Subdural thickening most consistent with post-surgical changes.
[**2128-12-12**] CXR: Ill-defined opacities in the right upper and lower lobes bilaterally have improved consistent with improving pneumonia.
There are no large pleural effusions.
3-cm thoracic right paraspinal mass with a thick enhancing rim and central fluid-intensity signal.
There is no appreciable bone marrow edema within the adjacent T12 vertebral body.
In this patient, status post right nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma, the findings are concerning for recurrent necrotic tumor, perhaps in a retrocrural lymph node.
Though abscess with a thick rind of enhancement cannot be fully excluded, the lack of reactive marrow change within the adjacent T12 vertebral body, would be somewhat unusual.
Infrarenal aortic aneurysm, minimally changed from the prior CT scan from [**2127**] with a maximal diameter measurement of approximately 3.2 cm.
Edema versus artifactual signal overlying the left parotid gland, which should be correlated with clinical examination.
There is a right paravertebral/retrocrural soft tissue lesion, likely representing a necrotic lymph node.
There is an exophytic mass arising from segment VI of the liver, with extension into the adjacent retroperitoneum.
Findings are highly concerning for metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
Right lower lobe consolidation with thin peripheral clearing.
Findings could represent aspiration or organizing pneumonia.
A nodular opacity at the left lung base has some surrounding ground-glass opacity and is likely infectious or inflammatory.
This does not have the typical appearance for metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm and focal dissection of the aorta just above the bifurcation.
Moderate sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of acute inflammation.
Small focal peripheral wedge-shaped hypodensity within the spleen may represent a small infarct.
New minimal pericardial fluid.
[**2128-12-11**] BLE ULTRASOUND: IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis within [**Month/Day/Year **] lower extremity veins.
[**2128-12-8**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse.
There is probable partial mitral leaflet flail (posterior leaflet).
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
If indicated, a TEE would better exclude a small valve vegetation.
[**2128-12-14**] TEE: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse.
There is focal posterior flail mitral leaflet.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
CONCLUSION: Severe MVP with a focal flail posterior mitral leaflet.
Severe mitral regurgitation.
No evidence of endocarditis.
Note: No viable or necrotic epithelial tumor is detected.

1) Right hemiplegia: On [**12-5**], patient deteriorated and was emergently intubated and brought to the OR for a left sided craniotomy for evacuation.
During surgery there was question of an underlying lesion or cyst and the resected area was sent to pathology for histology.
The pathology returned as hemorrhage and clot, there was no evidence of malignancy.
On [**12-6**] an MRI without contrast was done which showed post-operative changes but no lesion was seen.
His neurologic symptoms progressively improved during his hospitalization.
Of note, initially, he had difficulty swallowing and concern for aspiration pneumonia.
He was planned for PEG placement, but subsequent speech and swallow consultation revealed that he had a good gag and swallow, and after a video swallow, the patient was cleared for solid foods with thin liquids, but medications to be crushed in puree.
Patient will need to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**2129-1-11**] (appt in the system) with a Head CT.  NSGY recommends no Aspirin, Coumadin, or Plavix until follow-up appointment.
Any questions or concerns regarding his incision after discharge can be addressed by calling [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3231**] and asking for the NP for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to be paged  2) MRSA bacteremia:  During the patient's SICU course, the patient developed a fever to 102 on [**12-6**].
He was also noted to have thick secretions at that time as well.
He had complained of back pain, and an MRI C/T/L spine showed a paraspinal lesion that was concerning for a necrotic lymph node or mets, and CT Abd/pelvis showed a large liver mass.
Initially, there was concern for abscess or other infectious source there, but radiology did not feel this was likely infectious.
The liver lesion was biopsied, and prelim pathology read was likely malignancy, not infectious though final read is pending at the time of discharge.
Patient had a TTE which showed severe mitral regurgitation, but no vegetations.
He subsequently had a TEE which also showed no vegetations, but there was posterior mitral leaflet flair with severe MR.  ID felt that this would warrant a full 6 week course of antibiotic therapy as there may be some seeding or possible endocarditis there.
Most likely this represents an aspiration pneumonia during the initial episode prior to intubation.
Other possibilites include a MRSA pneumonia as well.
4) Exophytic mass on liver:  During the hospital course, imaging revealed a liver mass concerning for malignancy.
The patient had the mass biopsied under CT guidance.
**Follow-up of liver mass pathology will be needed as it was pending at the time of discharge  5) Nutrition: Cleared by video swallow study read as unremarkable.
Speech/swallow recommends normal solids and thin liquid diet.
7) PPX: no anticoagulation given recent bleed, continue bowel regimen  8) ACCESS: Left Picc  9) CODE:  Full  Medications on Admission: Aspirin 81 mg daily Amlodipine 5 mg daily Atenolol 100 mg daily Lisinopril 40 mg daily Ativan 0.5 mg q4h prn anxiety Zocor 80 mg daily   Discharge Medications: 1.
