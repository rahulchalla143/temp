Admission Date:  [**2185-3-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-3-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2131-11-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Aspirin / Lipitor / Glucophage  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4654**] Chief Complaint: sob  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: 53yoF with hx of DM, asthma, DVTs s/p IVC filter on plavix and coumadin,who presents from home with acute onset shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 11468**] was at home babys[**Name (NI) 12854**] for her grandaughter, sitting on the sofa, when she became acutely short of breath.
She had pain with inspiration, but no other chest pain or chest pressure, no n/v, no diaphoresis.
At home she has stable [**2-22**] pillow orthopnea, becomes short of breath with mild exertion although she does not report any history of chest pain with exertion.
Of note, she reports she has never experienced acute shortness of breath like this before.
EMS was called, found pt to have systolic blood pressure of 200, she was given nitro and lasix for presumed heart failure (although she has no documented history of CHF).
She reports some mild URI symptoms 2 weeks ago which are now resolved, as well as increased bilateral leg edema at that time, but no current fevers, chills, or cough.
CXR showed cardiomegaly, and a density in the right lower lobe which was read as possible early infection vs. atelectasis.
She was given a dose of levofloxacin for community aquired pna and trasnfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
Past Medical History: -Poorly controlled DMII -hypertension -asthma -anemia - profound iron deficiency [**2-21**] gastric and duodenal AV malformations, transfusion dependent, Hct baseline around 22-29 -depression -migraines -obesity -chronic abdominal pain -delayed gastric emptying -diverticulosis -extensive DVT [**2-27**] s/p thrombectomy, IVC filter placement, common and external iliac vein stenting on coumadin/plavix -OSA, on BiPAP 20/16 -?
No hx of hypercoagulability or AVMS.
No scleral icterus.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
JVD to the earlobe LUNGS: Dimished breath sounds, crackles in the bases bilaterally, R>L ABDOMEN: Obese, soft, diffusely tender to palpation, no guarding EXTREMITIES: Cool, 1+ edema, 1+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
Within this limitation, there is density and atelectasis in the right lower lobe.
Underlying or early infection cannot be excluded in this region.
The remainder of the lungs are clear without pneumothorax, pleural effusion.
No soft tissue or osseous abnormality is detected.
Limited study, however, interval development of a density and atelectasis in the right lower lobe.
Early infection cannot be excluded.
Echocardiogram:  The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Diastolic dysfunction with increased PCWP.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
<br>  [**3-16**] Pelvis and L-spine film to r/o fx [**2-21**] to fall:  HISTORY: Morbid obesity with diabetes with back pain after fall.
The vertebra and intervertebral disc spaces are quite well maintained without evidence of compression fracture.
Of incidental note is evidence of previous [**Month/Day (2) 1106**] surgery on the left and an IVC filter.
Brief Hospital Course: 53 yo F with hx of DM, asthma, DVTs s/p IVC filter on plavix and coumadin now, who presents from home with acute onset shortness of breath and evidence of heart failure on arrival to the ICU and PNA with initial hypoxia to the 70s - and placed on a NRB.
Given her presentation in the setting of elevated systolic blood pressure, she was diuresed with 20mg IV furosemide for concern of flash pulmonary edema contributing to her hypoxia.
On am of [**3-16**] - pt more stable from resp standpoint with 97% on RA, pt was transferred to floor, give 1 more dose of po lasix 20mg - feeling well am of [**3-17**] - ambulating without DOE, 92% on RA o2 sat, Echo showing evid of mild pulm HTN and dCHF without evid of sCHF.
Pt will be given CHF instruction, given a Rx for 20mg po lasix but to be taking only PRN - not on a scheduled dose for now - ***will need close f/u with her PCP in regards to this with focus now to keep BP controlled.
Dyspnea - more likely due to mild secondary pulmonary HTN with low thresholds for decompensation - here with mild PNA, bacterial (Community acquired) and CHF exacerbation - diastolic confirmed more by echo this stay -Failure supported by clincial history of worsening orthopnea and dyspnea with exertion as well as elevated BNP on admission, and elevated JVD and crackles on exam.
No previous diagnosis of heart failure but risk factors for CAD and stress in [**4-27**] showing mild inferior wall reversible perfusion abnormality and LVEF of 49%, as well as evidence of diastolic dysfunction on [**2182**] ECHO.
CXR with increased hilar fullness, as well as focal RLL opacity.
Low grade temp in ED with normal WBC and no symptoms of pneumonia are less suggestive of infection although crackles in R>L consistent with focal opacity of RLL on CXR.
No evidence of ACS with no EKG changes, one negative set of cardiac biomarkers.
-Continue Levofloxacin for 5 day course to cover for community aquired pna (given 2 more days at d/c) -CPAP on home settings -cont toprol at current dose <br>  2.
Anemia, chronic blood loss - Patient w/ chronic anemia due to multiple oozing AVM's and chronically guaiac +.
Hct is near baseline range and low suspicion that cause of acute presentation - though my have small degree of contribution - as d/w in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] - plan will be to tranfuse for Hct<25.
DVT/Anticoagulation -Continue home plavix and coumadin -Low threshold for CTA given history -Daily INR -noted on plavix - ****question for PCP whether to continue this for long-term to be f/u as outpt - noted per pt/family "history of head clot in [**2-27**] - reason for plavix" - records reviewed - particularly neuro note in [**6-27**] - per re-review of imaging in [**2-27**] - felt lesion more -  meningioma in the left prepontine cistern.
Will defer to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name10 (NameIs) **] evidence of acute worsening of chronic GI bleed will d/c but stable at time of d/c and will defer to PCP for longterm.
HTN - better controlled in hospital, occas elevated but when pain increased.
Asthma - no evidence of exacerbation at this time -continue home regimen <br>  7.
Neuropathy/Chronic Pain: though noted recent fall with worsened lower back pain with mild ttp on coccux.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: # Mild Pulmonary HTN # Apnea # Pneumonia # mild Diastolic CHF # Diabetes # Anemia, from chronic GI blood losses - your blood counts were stable and did not require more blood here # history of DVT # HTN # Neuropathy # Chronic Back Pain - note - x-rays did NOT show any evidence you had a fracture   Discharge Condition: stable, ambulating well, o2 sat of 93% RA   Discharge Instructions: Your diagnoses are as below, note your x-ray films did not show any evidence of any fracture.
Your [**Last Name **] problem for admission was your breathing which was found to be multifactorial as listed below - with the 2 main news problems being a pneumonia and mild CHF.
Given your heart failure is mild (from long-standing HTN) you will need to focus most on having your blood controlled for now and will be prescribed lasix (water pill) only for an as needed bases as the following: <br>  Check your weight every morning following going to the bathroom, if you gain more than 2 pounds from day prior - take 1 lasix tablet (20mg), if you gain more than 4 pounds call your provider and likely take 2 tablets (40mg).
<br>  If your symptoms worsen with breathing, develop new chest pain, new blood in your stools, and any other concerning symptom please call your provider or return to the emergency room.
