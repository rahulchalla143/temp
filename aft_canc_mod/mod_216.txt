Small bowel resection   History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 87-year-old female Jehovah's Witness with a significant cardiovascular history who was diagnosed with a poorly differentiated carcinoma in the left colon after presenting with a hematocrit of 10.
Preoperative staging with a CT scan revealed a large mass in the transverse colon and possible pulmonary nodules.
Because of the profound nature of the anemia induced by the tumor,surgical resection was indicated even in the face of metastasis.
Past Medical History: PMH: CAD, HTN, DM2, hyperlipidemia, , h/o CVA, h/o MI, h/o TIA PSH; CABGx 4, hysterectomy   Social History: Jehovah's Witness.

Congestive heart failure has slightly improved with decreasing perihilar edema but residual diffuse interstitial edema remaining.
Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is also slightly improved.
Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Stable parenchymal opacities, likely reflecting moderate pulmonary edema.
Bibasilar effusions and associated atelectasis, left greater than right.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Evaluate for acute intracranial process.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
New bilateral parenchymal opacities as described, which in the presence of known cardiac disease most likely represent pulmonary edema.
Interval minimal increased in heart size.
Bilateral pleural effusion most likely related to same process.
Nodules demonstrated on the torso CT cannot be assessed on the current study in the presence of pulmonary edema.
No ASD or PFO by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction.
No LV mass/thrombus.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Severe PA systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior wall, as well as distal septum and apex (c/w multivessel coronary artery disease).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Severe pulmonary hypertension.
She was routinely evaluated in the PACU, and transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name **] for post-op care.
POD1: She became aphasic in the morning of POD1.
She appeared slightly lethargic, but easily aroused.
She made attempts to speak, but with difficulty formulating comprehendable words.
She underwent a Head CT, MRI/MRA, and bilateral carotid ultrasounds.
POD2: Her aphasia was somewhat worse on POD#2 and her cardiac enzymes were positive.
The MRI/MRA revealed an acute left frontal lobe embolic stroke.
Cardiac: She was seen by Cardiology in ICU due to elevated troponin levels indicating a myocardial infarction who recommended following cardiac enzymes.
She was managed with heparin gtt, asa, metoprolol, & lipitor was increased to 80 mg daily.She was diuresed in the ICU with monitoring of lytes and renal function.
Risks and benefits of participating given recent NSTEMI discussed with patient.
Her abdominal incision is OTA.
She has active bowel sounds with loose stools.
Provide continued assessment of skin to prevent further breakdown.
She was evaluated per Speech & Swallow.
HEME: She is a Jehovah's Witness, but agreed to tranfusion with PRBC due to a drop in hematocrit.
EXTREM: She appears to have baseline use of upper extremeties with mild left sided weakness.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Oxycodone-Acetaminophen 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain for 2 weeks.
