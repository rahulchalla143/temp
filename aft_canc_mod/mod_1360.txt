Diffuse predominantly peripheral ground-glass opacities.

However, after aggressive fluid resuscitation the pt developped significant respiratory distress.
CXR demonstrated mild copd and mild b/l effusions.
EKG at the time was without evidence of ischemia.
Pt was ruled out for MI by enzymes.
Given persistent O2 requirement, CTA checked on [**7-26**] which demonstrated no PE, but "diffuse predominantly peripheral ground-glass opacities consistent with multifocal pneumonia; the differential diagnosis would include pulmonary edema from ARDS," and moderate b/l effusions.
Pt had been having intermittent low-grade temps to 100.
CXR showed evidence of new pulm edema, pt was given lasix 20 mg iv x3 and had good urine out-put though repeat cxr showed worsened edema.
Pt was transferred to the MICU for continued respiratory distress and hypoxia.
In the MICU, pt diuresed but she continued to be hypoxic and was managed with non invasive ventilation.
Pt had significant difficulty weaning and was eventually started on high dose steroids for treatment of possible BOOP/ARDS or eosinophilic pna.
Pt showed significant clinical improvement with high dose steroids and was weaned down to 3LNC over 3days.
Her abd pain was well controlled with PO pain medications and was not limiting intake.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every 6-8 hours as needed for pain for 7 days.
