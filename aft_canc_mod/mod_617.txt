Of note, his diagnosis of metastatic colon cancer came only several weeks prior to this hospitalization.
He also had a power port placed without complications on [**2-24**].
Per patient was in his usual recent state of health until [**2-23**] when he developed left calf pain and swelling.
Denies having jaw or arm pain, diaphoresis, palpitations, or N/V/D.
His exam was benign aside from a nose bleed but CTA showed small subsegmental PEs.
Moreover, given his h/o metastatic cancer he needed a head CT prior to hep gtt; preliminary read is negative for acute intracranial process.
He had 2 episodes of <1tsp bright red hemoptysis, but stated that this was consistent with his usual nosebleeds and stated that it was coming from his nose and not coughed up from his chest.

Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied cough, shortness of breath.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.

Past Medical History: - Hereditary Telangectasia with pulmonary arterial venous malformations - pulmonary shunts s/p two previous closure procedures.
pt reports his pulmonologist is thinking about another closure procedure for another shunt - nosebleeds - systemic emboli - TIA - iron deficiency anemia  Social History: Patient is originally from [**Country 13622**] Republic; he just recently returned from there, cutting a 3 week vacation short, after a CT scan of his abdomen showed liver lesions.
Family History: Mother had well-controlled HTN and [**Name (NI) 2320**].
Nobody in his family has hereditary telangectasia or epistaxis.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 98.4 BP: 132/73 P: 97 R: 17 18 O2: 99% 3L NC General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress, but tearful HEENT: Sclera icteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
No asymmetrical swelling.
Pt reports ttp of the L calf, but there is no palpable cord.
CT Head prelim read: no acute intracranial process.
CTA: subsegmental filling defects in the right apical pulmonary arteries,consistent with pulmonary embolisms.
metastatic pulmonary nodules and hilar adenopathy as before.
[**2-27**] bilateral LE u/s: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
[**2-26**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia.
Findings are non-specific and unstable baseline makes assessment difficult.
Since the previous tracing of [**2106-5-19**] sinus tachycardia is now present.
Urine: [**2113-2-26**] URINE Blood-NEG Nitrite-NEG Protein-NEG Glucose-NEG Ketone-NEG Bilirub-NEG Urobiln-NEG pH-6.5 Leuks-NEG [**2113-2-26**] URINE Hours-RANDOM UreaN-271 Creat-46 Na-62 Uric Ac-35.1 [**2113-2-26**] URINE Osmolal-396  Brief Hospital Course: 47yo M with h/o metastatic colon CA, pulmonary and nasal AVMs with continuous nosebleeds admitted with fever, calf and chest pain and found to have subsegmental PEs admitted for anticoagulation.
# PE: Likely secondary to underlying malignancy, and given that the patient has a high risk of bleed from AVM's and telangiectasias, he was monitored in the ICU during initiation of anticoagulation with weight based Heparin gtt.
Patient resistant to the idea of injections long-term so would prefer coumadin as outpatient with simply a short lovenox bridge.
Patient's chest pain and inspiratory discomfort resolved, as did his calf discomfort.
# AVMs: Stable.
Patient was monitored closely for bleeding without any decrease in Hct during his stay.
Patient instructed to hold pressure and to call if the nosebleeds worsen or become uncontrollable.
# Metastatic colon CA: Patient on FLOX chemotherapy regimen, now cycle 1, week 2, on admission.
# Constipation: patient required aggressive bowel regimen to relieve constipation and associated abdominal discomfort.
patient takes multiple opiates for abdominal pain, and so medication and disease likely both contribute to his constipation.
patient discharged with opiates for abdominal pain (home pain regimen) and with bowel regimen.
# Fever: Believed secondary to PE & known malignancy.
The patient demonstrated no localizing source of infection and was not neutropenic so no antibiotics were started.
# Anemia: Patient's HCT on admission was stable at 25.5, compared to HCT at time of cancer diagnosis ~27.
# Access: port, left chest Code:  Full (confirmed with patient in the ICU)  Communication: Patient and ex-girlfriend, [**Name (NI) 6303**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 15107**])  Medications on Admission: Acetaminophen 325-650 mg Q6H prn pain, fever.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Polyethylene Glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1) dose PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: Fifteen (15) ML PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for constipation.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*1*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic colon cancer Pulmonary embolism Hereditary telangiectasias Chronic nosebleeds   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2-26**] to [**3-2**], [**2112**].
Here at [**Hospital1 18**] you were found to have blood clots in your lungs, likely related to your colon cancer.
You had a fever, and this resolved - perhaps this was because of the blood clots or the colon cancer; no infection was found.
You had leg pain that resolved, this could have been the site of the original blood clot.
You had chemotherapy on [**3-2**] without incident.
