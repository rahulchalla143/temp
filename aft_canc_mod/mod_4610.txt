Of note she was discharged two days ago to home with hospice care after being hospitalized for labial induration as well as peritoneal metastases with abdominal ascietes and RLE/pelvic thrombus found on CT scans.
She was also incidentally noted to have proctitis on her CT and was treated with 7 days of cipro/flagyl.
Urinalysis showed moderate bacteria and a chest x-ray showed a right pleural effusion.
A CT abdomen showed no evidence of active extravasation but showed multiple peritoneal and omental implants, ascietes, a right iliac [**Last Name (LF) 86508**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] occluded left common femoral artery (with patent nearby collaterals), a stable right renal infarct and a narrowed celiac oriigin as well as a left atrial filling defect which was not present on prior CTA and was felt to be consistent with a clot.
On arrival in the ICU she was nonverbal consistent with her baseline and did not appear to be in no acute distress.
Past Medical History: - DM II - HTN - Hx of uterine cancer s/p hysterectomy - Afib, on Coumadin - s/p large left MCA stroke, now completely dependant of ADLs with G-tube for feeding and non-verbal at baseline - s/p PEG placed [**2196-5-1**]   Social History: Haitian Creole.
No EtOH, no smoking, no illicits.
The heart size remains mildly enlarged.
Redemonstrated within the right infrahilar region is a patchy airspace opacity which is stable, and likely represents an area of atelectasis.
There is a small right pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax is seen.
There are multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
Small right pleural effusion.
The lung bases demonstrate moderate pleural effusion on the right with associated atelectasis.
There is no intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
The gallbladder is unremarkable without stones or wall edema.
In the lower pole of the right kidney is a 2 cm in diameter hypoenhancing area, unchanged from prior, and likely represents a renal infarct.
There is no evidence of active extravasation within the stomach or bowel.
The small and large intestine show no signs of obstruction.
Large amount of intra-abdominal ascites is seen.
There is no organized fluid collection or free air.
Prominent retroperitoneal lymph nodes are seen, most prominent of which are in the left para-aortic region and measure 15 mm in the short axis (4; 239).
A single locule of gas is seen within the bladder, consistent with recent catheterization.
Small amount of free fluid is seen in the pelvis, contiguous with the aforementioned intra-abdominal ascites.
CTA: The aorta is of normal caliber along its course with moderate atherosclerotic calcification.
There is aneurysmal dilatation of the right common iliac artery measuring 28 x 25 mm (4A; 49) with mural thrombus.
The right internal iliac artery also demonstrates ectasia with mural thrombus.
BONES: Mild degenerative changes are seen in the thoracolumbar spine, most prominent at L4-L5 with endplate sclerosis and anterior osteophytes.
G-tube place without evidence of active contrast extravasation within the stomach or bowel.
Moderate right-sided pleural effusion with atelectasis.
Left atrial thrombus.
Numerous peritoneal and omental implants with intra-abdominal ascites compatible with peritoneal carcinomatosis.
3 cm aneurysm of the right common iliac artery with mural thrombus.
Occluded left common femoral artery and proximal superficial femoral artery.
Cardiology: ECG Study Date of [**2197-1-8**]  6:00:30 PM   Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and occasional ventricular premature beats.
Cannot rule out septal myocardial infarction.
Low QRS in the precordial leads and extensive non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Read by: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **]    Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 129 0 70 302/422 0 -7 90   Brief Hospital Course: 82 year year-old female with metastatic uterine cancer, multiple comorbidities, nonverbal at baseline presented with concern for G tube bleeding and infection and found to be septic with likely UTI and likely DIC.
# Sepsis: Patient had a very poor baseline with significant functional disability following metastatic cancer and left MCA stroke with hemorrhagic ransformation which left her completely dependent for all ADLs.
She presented following bleeding from her PEG tube with concern for infection.
On arrival in the ED she met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis (WBC 26.1) and tachycardia (105) with no hypotension.
She had a CT-A abdomen showed no evidence of active extravasation but showed multiple peritoneal and omental implants, ascietes, a right iliac [**Last Name (LF) 86508**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] occluded left common femoral artery (with patent nearby collaterals), a stable right renal infarct and a narrowed celiac oriigin as well as a left atrial filling defect which was not present on prior CTA and was felt to be consistent with a clot.
The patient's G tube was in place with no associated fluid collection or abscess along its track.
Likely source was felt to be possible UTI (given mildly positive UA - culture was ultimattely negative) versus cellulitis or other soft tissue infection surrounding G-tube.
She was noted to be thrombocytopenic secondary to DIC versus HIT (had recent heparin on last admission) given falling platelets which had fallen from 354 on [**12-30**] to 63 on [**1-8**] and a low fibrinogen of 8.5 and already high INR 3.5 given concomitant warfarin therapy.
This was felt to be likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, hypovolemia, or poor forward flow secondary to new onset CHF.
# Anemia/G Tube Bleeding: oozing in setting of high INR and low platelets.
Warfarin was held and teher was no further significant bleeding noted.
# Fast Atrial Fibrilation: Noted on prior admissions and patient was treated with metoprolol and diltiazem at baseline and on this admission was tachycardic to 140s in setting of having not received medications for most of the day in teh context of sepsis as above.
# DVTs and Pelvic Thrombus: Recently subtherapeutic and now supertherapeutic on warfarin on this admission.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 3003**] imaging showed occluded L common femoral artery w/ patent nearby collaterals.
We held warfarin in setting of supratherapeutic INR and patient was made CMO as above and died on [**1-10**].
# Right Lower Extremity Swelling: Known right iliac 3 cm aneurysm as previously imaged.
# Uterine Cancer: s/p resection in [**2194**], now with metasteses.
# Goals of Care: Patient was critically ill with advanced metastatic disease and multiple comorbidities.
Per discussion with son they had been actively considering changing patient's code status but initially did not due to difficulties accepting this decision.
Discharge Medications: Patient died  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Sepsis Acute renal failure Thrombocytopenia ?
