RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):  Legionella negative Blood cultures NGTD Urine cultures NGTD  IMAGING: CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2126-6-14**] 2:14 PM FINDINGS: There is a dense right perihilar consolidation consistent with pneumonia.
Blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles is present suggesting small effusions.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Dense right perihilar consolidation most consistent with pneumonia in the acute setting.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2126-6-15**] 5:21 AM Significant interval progression of widespread parenchymal consolidations may represent interval development of severe pulmonary edema superimposed on pre-existing right lower lobe consolidation.
The bilateral pleural effusions have developed in the interim, at least mild to moderate.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 yo M with h/o CHF, Afib on coumadin, CHF, AR s/p mechanical AVR, severe MR, Alzheimer's disease p/w hypoxia, respiratory distress, bilateral infiltrates on CXR, elevated lactate and Cr improving with IVF, hypotension now on pressors, also with anemia  Patient with evidence of PNA on chest xray with bilateral infiltrates, started on vanco/zosyn/levofloxacin in ED.
On admission he was on pressure support with norepinephrine for hypotension and received several liters of IV normal saline.
Sputum cultre showed GNR preliminarily and urine legionella was negative, blood cultures showed no growth to date.
IV PPI was started for concern for upper GI bleed since he had esophageal ulcer in the past.
INR elevated on admission at 4.8 on coumadin and continued to be elvated to 7.8 in setting of anemia, so pt received PO vitamin K with improvement in INR.
Aspirin was continued considering trop elevation and ischemic changes likely in setting of demand on admission EKG, but discontinued when INR elevated to 7.8.
Patient was able to be weaned off pressors and appearance of CXR showed mild improvement.
