The falls were thought to be due to a combination of neuropathy post chemotherapy and mild cervical spondylosis and she was discharged to a nursing home.
She also comes with a new dx of PNA, possible aspiration PNA and was treated with levaquin at OSH prior to arrival.
Head CT showed no interval change in mid-line shift or size of SDH.
Patient also received CTX for finding of pneumonia on CXR.
Multiple myeloma s/p chemotherapy, followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2856**] at [**Company 2860**].
Seen by oncology for decreased counts on last admit and recommended to receive pulse steroids.
HTN  3.
Peripheral neuropathy due to chemotherapy  4. s/p both hips, knees replacement and L ankle surgery  5.
Frequent falls   Social History: SH: Was living alone until recent falls with subdural requiring rehab - does not drive but pays own bills, takes own meds and etc.
No cigarettes or EtOH.

[**3-29**] CT Head: Evolution of acute-on-chronic right subdural hematoma with posterior layering of the acute component, now tracking along the tentorium.
There is no evidence for new hemorrhage, increased mass effect, or edema.
There is no shift of minimal mass effect on subjacent right occipital gyri remains seen, and sulci are unchanged in configuration.
The sulci are otherwise prominent, compatible with age-related involution.
Again seen is scattered periventricular white matter hypodensities, consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia.
There is no fracture.
Imaged paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
IMPRESSION: Evolution of right subdural hematoma without evidence for new hemorrhage or increased mass effect.
No new hemorrhage.
No fracture or prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
[**3-28**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild resting outflow tract gradient, likely due to vigorous left ventricular function.
Severe pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: # Subdural Hematoma: Patient continued to have decreased level of consciousness throughout the hospital stay.
CT head and subsequent MRI/MRA were significant for stable SDH but chronic embolic events.
Neurology was consulted and an EEG showed spike and wave patterns consistent with pre-seizure activity.
Dilantin was given throughout the hospital course with no seizures noted.
# Hopsital Acquired Pneumonia.
Was started on levo for atypical coverage on [**3-29**] which was stopped [**4-2**].
Culture data only positive for GPCs in sputum, no speciation done.
Remained tachypneic but oxygentating well until the date of death.
The patient became hypoxic and bradycardic, and expired in the afternoon.
# Falls/?Syncope: recent admit with extensive work-up attributing LE weakness and falls to cervical spondylosis and multilevel degenerative disease with myelopathy and neuropathy.
Unclear if LOC with fall so would pursue syncope w/u, which is likely [**3-7**] UE neuropathy, weakness, ?
MRA showed no lesions.
# Myeloma: On pulse decadron as per heme-onc for tx of myeloma.
# Pancytopenia: [**3-7**] to myeloma.
# Renal Failure: At baseline from last admission.
Unclear etiology to CKD, but may represent complication from myeloma.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6   hours) as needed for fever or pain.
