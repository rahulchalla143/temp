Lumbar puncture   History of Present Illness: 64yo right handed man with PMH significant for HTN, DMII, HCV, and recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] for ataxia presents from [**Hospital3 **] with altered consciousness.
In the ED, HCT was performed and showed a large R frontal hemorrhage filling the right ventricles.
This was thought to be secondary to stroke vs seizure.
At the time, an MRI showed two frontal lesions, one which was thought to be secondary to hemorrhage, one thought to be secondary to infarction.
His mental status was noted to be declining, now only responding to painful stimuli with occasional spontaneous eye opening.
Renal consult was called [**9-4**] for worsening renal failure.
He was reintubated on the afternoon of [**9-4**] for airway protection with worsening mental status.
He was transferred to the MICU service on [**9-4**] as it was felt that his primary problems are not surgical.
LP was done [**9-12**] and showed 4+ PMNs on gram stain, no organizms.
The patient had to have tracheostomy and PEG tube placement for failure to wean from vent.
His ICU course was also c/b elevation in LFTs and statin was held.
Past Medical History: * HCV -- genotype 1 initially diagnosed in [**2128**], likely secondary to h/o IVDU in [**2089**]; currently on trial with PEG interferon; liver biopsy [**3-/2133**] showed stage-IV disease * HTN * Diabetes type II * Retinal embolus * Gout * Left ankle osteochondral defect (will have surgery involved grafts from patella) * Pruritis   Social History: lives alone, separated from wife, grown children.
He is a painter, and does not have much business currently given the season.
Family History: Family history is positive for liver cancer in  his father who was a heavy drinker.
Corneal reflexes intact.
[**9-26**] colonoscopy- Polyps in the transverse colon and sigmoid colon(polypectomy) Grade 2 internal hemorrhoids.Normal mucosa in the colon .
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2136-9-26**] 4:15 PM Again seen is a right medial frontal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage with extensive surrounding vasogenic edema with expected evolution of blood products.
There has been complete resolution of the left frontal lobe hemorrhage and bilateral intraventricular hemorrhages seen on the prior examination.
Vasogenic edema remains present in the left frontal lobe.
There is no new acute intracranial hemorrhage or midline shift.
There is no hydrocephalus.
A burr hole defect is seen in the left frontal bone.
IMPRESSION: No new acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Evolution of blood products with persistent vasogenic edema in both cerebral hemispheres as described above.
[**2136-9-20**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): No failure, no infiltrates.
[**2136-9-19**] LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US: No evidence of focal mass within the liver.
No evidence of biliary ductal dilatation.
EEG ([**9-11**]): This is an abnormal EEG due to the unreactive, slow and disorganized background activity.
This EEG suggests a moderate to moderately severe encephalopathy, which may be seen with infections, medications, toxic metabolic abnormalities or ischemia.
Considerable interval improvement in the appearance of bilateral intraventricular hemorrhages, without hydrocephalus.
Similar appearance of intraparenchymal hemorrhage along the left frontal catheter tract.
Slightly improved right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
No pleural abnormality.
Pulmonary vascular congestion has improved.
There is no pleural abnormality.
Stable appearance of bilateral intraventricular hemorrhages and of intraparenchymal hemorrhages within the right centrum ovale and recent catheter tract.
[**2136-9-5**] LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US: No ascites.
[**2136-9-5**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Mediastinal and pulmonary venous congestion are new, and mild cardiomegaly has worsened, consistent with cardiac decompensation and/or volume overload.
Lungs are low in volume but clear of any focal abnormality.
New hemorrhage along the catheter tract, extending into the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle.
No evidence of hydrocephalus.
PORT: No evidence of hydronephrosis.
[**2136-9-4**] BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS: No DVT.
New hemorrhage along the catheter tract, extending into the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle.
No evidence of hydrocephalus.
CXR ([**9-3**])- The lungs remain clear of focal consolidation and the lateral costophrenic sulci are sharply marginated.
The right CVL has been removed and there is no PTX.
CT head ([**9-3**])- New hemorrhage along the catheter tract, extending into the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle.
No evidence of hydrocephalus.
MRI/A brain ([**8-31**])- The previously described intraparenchymal hematoma on the MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**2136-8-16**] has enlarged.
However, compared to the head CT of [**2136-8-30**], there has been no change.
There is mild associated mass effect without evidence of herniation.
Since the head CT of [**2136-8-30**], there has been development of a moderate-to-large left subgaleal hematoma.
CT head ([**8-30**])- Large right parenchymal hemorrhage with blood dissecting into the ventricles, with associated hydrocephalus.
Brief Hospital Course: This patient was seen in the ED with a right frontal hemorrhage and IVH.
On POD3, the patient was alert in the morning with possible left-sided neglect.
He had no new issues.
MICU Course:  Pt was transferred to the MICU on [**2136-9-4**] for declining mental status in face of fever (began [**2136-9-2**]) of ?
Upon admission to the MICU, pt was re-intubated due to inability to protect airway.
# Fever w/ Declining Mental Status: Pt's MS began to decline while fevers began, w/o significant change in CT scans of head.
Seizure - Pt was started on oxycarbamazapine and Keppra, and EEG was ordered to r/o possibility of subclinical seizures, but results were suggestive of global encephalopathy (repeated [**9-11**] w/o significant change).
Increased ICP - Neurosurgery was consulted for possible IC cath blockage (possible ALOC due to increased ICP), but ICP was unremarkable; EVD was discontinued on [**9-5**], and neurosurgery signed-off w/o ability to explain declining MS.  Pt also received a f/u CT head on [**9-11**] with improved ICH and no signs of increased ICP.
ID - Given intracranial instramentation, both bacterial meningitis and viral encephalitis were considered.
LPs produced CSF for analysis on [**9-2**] and [**9-12**]; the [**9-2**] sample failed to reveal a pathogen and revealed only 1+ PMNs; the [**9-12**] CSF was significant for 4+ PMNs but failed to reveal an insulting pathogen.
Per neuro and ID recs, pt was changed to ceftriaxone (with vanc continued) for possible bacterial meningitis on [**9-11**]; pt was then switched to ceftaz with vanc to complete a 2 week course (from [**9-11**] start date).
Acyclovir was added [**9-12**] for possible HSV encephalitis per neuro recs, but was discontinued per renal recs on [**9-15**] (?
possible acyclovir renal toxicity).
Pt continued to spike fevers until [**9-14**], but after that day, remained afebrile (but for occassional low-grade fevers) throughout the remainder of his ICU course.
Uremia - given acute on chronic renal failure, ALOC due to metabolic abnormality secondary to renal failure was explored.
Renal consultation, while concerned about the cause of pt's acute on chronic renal failure, did not believe that renal function was causative of ALOC, and did not recommend HD.
Hepatic Encephalopahty - given HCV cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy was investigated.
Pt lacked asterixis on exam, and LFTs were not suggestive of acute decompensation during the declining mental status.
LFTs only began to rise on [**9-11**], with significant elevation on [**9-19**]; however, this change was not temporally associated with pt's ALOC, and was not considered to be causative.
Ultimately, pt's mental status showed a mild improvement throughout the course of his MICU stay, with pt able to track examiners with his eyes when on his right; pt was still ignoring his left side upon transfer to floor; movement of right arm was noted, no other motor activity was appreciated.
# Acute on chronic renal failure:  Cr reached a maximum of 3.8 vs. 2.0 at baseline and at admission.
Renal consultation and testing concluded that acute on chronic renal failure was secondary to septic ATN with possible acyclovir toxicity (given appearance of acyclovir crystals in urine).
# UTI - Pt was found to have a UTI while Foley cath was in place on [**9-8**], with UCX failing to reveal insulting pathogen (likely due to broad-spectrum coverage of abx prior to drawing of samples).
Pt was treated empirically by continuing cefepime and vanc (initially started for fever of unkwown source).
# Hepatitis w/ Pancreatitis - LFTs and amylase/lipase were noted to be elevated in an obstructive pattern on [**9-19**]; RUQ U/S failed to reveal cholelithiasis or CBD dilation; CPK was assayed, and was elevated, which in the context of elevated LFTs and pancreatic enzymes, was highly suggestive of statin toxicity.
# Respiratory failure: Pt was re-intubated in the ICU for failure to protect his airway given declining mental status.
Pt maintained excellent oxygenation, and f/u CXRs failed to reveal infiltrates or pulmonary edema.
# Anemia: consistent with chronic inflammation and possible underlying GI bleed (guiac + stools).
Completed 84wks of PEG-IFN in COPILOT study with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], d/c'd for intolerable side effects.
INR normal but low albumin, so likely some synthetic dysfunction.
-When patient transferred to floor [**9-22**], vanc/ceftriaxone for possible meningitis, with tracking eye movements, afebrile, trach mask 35%, hypernatremia resolving, renal failure improving, PEG tube in place, diabetes controlled on regimen, but  course complicated by question of seizures, and lower GI bleed.
CT head with no evidence of new bleed.
Preliminary for EEG with no evidence of seizure.
Started on Dilantin 100 TID with continuing of jerking movements continuous, leaning towards a status epilepticus picture, vs myoclonic jerks.
Neuro felt picture likely represents Epilepsia Partialis Continua.
Large intracranial bleed, meningitis, metabolic disturbances, all make patient prone to seizure activity.
4 PRBC in total given.
Colonoscopy with evidence of large sessile polyp in transverse colon and sigmoid colon.
History of jejunal AVM, and esophageal varices.
DDAVP given, in the setting of possible uremic bleeding.
