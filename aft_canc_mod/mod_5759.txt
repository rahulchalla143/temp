He had uncontrollable arm movements and twitching.
Exam was notable for incomprehensable speech, bilateral rhonchi and guarding on abdominal exam.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis was concerning for pneumoperitoneum and likely anterior pelvic abscess abutting bladder dome.
Past Medical History: 1. prostate ca s/p XRT [**2119**] 2. bladder ca, papillary urothelial carcinoma, high grade (dx in  [**2133-3-20**]), nonmetastatic (negative cystoscopy [**8-24**])  -most recent cystoscopy and bladder resection in [**2138-7-20**] 3. lumbar fracture L5 -- w/multiple steroid injections, previously on chronic opioid therapy 4.

Melanoma, s/p removal  Social History: Lives in [**Hospital3 **] facility with the help of a caretaker, [**Name (NI) 3065**].

CXR [**2138-9-12**]: Bibasilar (right greater than left) opacities might represent multifocal pneumonia, aspiration, or atelectasis.
Moderate amount of free air in the abdomen (pneumoperitoneum).
Focal gas collection in the anterior pelvis (suspect at least partially extraperitoneal) abutting the bladder dome and likely related to bladder pathology and rupture.
However, there is no direct contact with bowel loops and there is no evidence of diverticulitis or appendicitis.
There is no definite evidence of fluid collection or abscess formation.
Fluid collection around the spleen has low attenuation likely represents simple fluid, much less likely hemorrhage.
No evidence of intra-abdominal hematoma.
CT Head [**2138-9-12**]: No acute intracranial process.
Mucosal thickening or fluid accumulation in the ethmoid air cells and nasal cavity.
Ethmoid air cell hemorrhage cannot be completely excluded, although findings are likely secondary to intubation.
No fracture seen.
Since the prior study, there has been interval development of small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis as well as moderate congestive failure.
LUE ultrasound [**2138-9-15**]: No evidence of DVT.
ECG [**2138-9-16**]: Atrial fibrillation.
Conducted complexes show RSR' pattern in lead V1 and early R wave progression.
CT head [**2138-9-19**]: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
Opacification behind the heart is consistent with pleural effusion and atelectasis.
In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
Minimal atelectasis is seen at the right base.
Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is again consistent with mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] yo M with a history of bladder ca, COPD, afib on coumadin who presented with acute onset dyspnea The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by VRE UTI and sepsis.
He was extubated the day after admission and given Lasix for pulmonary edema after extubation.
He required frequent suctioning to maintain his O2 sats in the low 90's and had some difficulty clearing his heavy secretions.
At that time, a family meeting was held and given his multiple comorbidities and current hospital course, he was made DNR/DNI.
SEPTIC SHOCK: Likely urinary source with enterococcus.
Also found to have pneumoperitoneum and pelvic abscesses on CT scan, likely secondary to bladder cancer and recent resection.
DELIRIUM: He was found down with incomprehensible speech prior to admission felt to be due to severe infection.
He received kayexelate and did not have EKG changes and his potassium level improved.
ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: His creatinine was elevated to 3.1 from his baseline of 1.7-1.9 felt to be due to hypovolemia and severe infection.
Hemolysis labs were negative and it was felt that this was most likely due to bleeding from his urogenital tract.
At the time of discharge, he had hematuria secondary to self-removal of his foley.
Stat CT cystogram confirmed small superior dome intraperitoneal leak.
They were held once patient came out to floor due to trauma related hematuria.
