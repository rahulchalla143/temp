is a 56 year-old female with metastatic breast cancer who presented with bilateral lower extremity and abdominal petechiae/ecchymoses, recent onset right low back pain, and increasing weakness.
The patient stated that she began to develop low back pain on the right approximately seven days PTA.
She described the pain as dull in quality, constantly present, and has not increased in severity since the time of onset.
There is no history of trauma to the area.
She also noted petechiae over her abdomen and lower extremities for the past two days PTA.
also complained of increasing weakness for the past week PTA.
She noted that the weakness has been progressive since onset.
On review of systems, the patient denied recent fever, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, N/V/D, constipation, abdominal pain, BRBPR, hematuria, dysuria, arthralgias, or myalgias.
She has had no recent change in her appetite.
She did admit to one episode of lightheadedness on the morning of admission after urinating.
She did not experience LOC or fall.
In the ED, the patient was found to have a low hematocrit and platelet count.
was first diagnosed with breast cancer in [**2101**] status post right mastectomy, chemotherapy, radiation, autologous [**Year (4 digits) 500**] marrow transplant in [**2104**].
She has metastatic lesions to [**Year (4 digits) 500**], liver, and lungs.
She has recently discontinued from Zometa because of elevated creatinine, metastasis to the [**Year (4 digits) 500**], liver, and lung.
MRI showed cerebellar and pituitary lesions, which were felt to be metastasis from her breast primary.
Repeat MRI on [**2113-3-13**] showed substantial but incomplete regression of cerebellar and pituitary metastases with leptomeningeal enhancement.

3) Innumerable hepatic metastasis.
4) Prominent retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
5) Likely right renal cyst.
6) Diffuse osseous metastatic disease.
V/Q scan [**2113-4-5**]: Matched abnormalities at the right lung base are compatible with the chest X-ray findings.
Although there are no findings particularly suggestive of pulmonary embolism; pulmonary embolism in this location cannot beruled out.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Diffuse osseous metastatic disease  LE dopplers [**2113-4-9**]: 1.
Occlusive thrombus in the right popliteal vein and nonocclusive eccentric thrombus in the right superficial femoral vein.
Findings suggestive of a nonocclusive thrombus in the left superficial femoral vein.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**2113-4-10**]: 1) No evidence of functional bowel obstruction or perforation.
2) Unchanged appearance of innumerable hepatic metastases, retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement, and stranding at the root of the mesentery.
3) Diffuse subcutaneous edema and new small amounts of indeterminant fluid in the pelvis, and thickening of the gallbladder wall without focal inflammatory change.
The gallbladder is not overly distended, and there is no definite evidence of acute cholecystitis.
The findings are likely due to fluid overload/third spacing, possibly secondary to hypoalbunemia given the patient's underlying hepatic metastases.
4) Worsening bilateral lower lobe consolidations.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
RUQ US [**2113-4-11**]: No evidence for cholecystitis, or intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
CXR [**2113-4-12**]: Unchanged appearance of the chest with extensive predominantly basilar opacities with probable bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 56 year-old female with metastatic breast cancer who initially presented on [**2113-4-5**] with c/o bilateral lower extremity and abdominal petechiae/ecchymoses, about 7 day h/o right low back pain, and increasing weakness.
In the ED, the patient was found to have a low hematocrit and platelet count.
CT of the torso showed progression of metastatic disease in liver, RP, and abdomen.
Her lower back pain was thought to be associated with malignancy.
Patient also noted to have pancytopenia ( presumably related to BM suppression/infiltration of [**Date Range 500**] marrow by mets).
On [**4-9**] she was noted to have left-sided pleuritic CP.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia.
LENIs (patient with dye allergy) showed R popliteal occlusive DVT, R SFV non-occlusive DVT and L SFV non-occlusive DVT.
She also complained of increased abdominal pain and was noted to have abdominal distension.
KUB showed probable pSBO with distended loops of small bowel.
From 2pm on, patient in sinus tachy 120-130's.
The source of bacteremia was not clear.
The patient had an episode of acute onset of shortness of breath associated with tachycardia, increased oxygen requirements that was followed by anxiety/agitation that was controlled with Ativan.
Diagnostic investigations were limited by patient having a h/o allergy to contrast.
However, given clinical scenario and known LE DVT, it was felt that the patient likely did have a PE.
Metastatic breast cancer 2.
Bacteremia 3.
