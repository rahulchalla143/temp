Admission Date:  [**2130-12-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-12-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-10-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea and weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Paracentesis  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 15942**] is a 58 yo male w/ esophageal CA believed to be in remission and hepatitis C who presented to the ER with dyspnea and weakness over the last week.
Per report, patient has had a clinical decline over the last 5months with massive anasarca, ascites, weakness, and shortness of breath.
His PET scan from yesterday revealed ascites, pleural effusions, but showed that his esophageal CA treatment with cisplatin and 5FU was definitive.
His oncologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt his symptoms must be due to a decline in his liver function in the setting of known Hepatitis C from IV drug use.
He became hypotensive and had SBP in the 80's while in the ER, although he was asymptomatic.
He had a CXR that showed early PNA in the LLL for which he received levaquin.
Hepatology was consulted in the ER and believe this to be cholestatic liver disease.
+runny nose, + dry cough, + leg edema, +hemorrhoids (-) Denies fever, chest pain or tightness.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.
Past Medical History: -Esophageal CA thought to be definitively treated with cisplastin and 5-FU -Hepatitis C diagnosed at age 17 for which he has never been treated or followed -Ascites and 2 paracenteses   Social History: Patient states he quit smoking 1 week ago, although he smells of cigarettes.
+ horizontal fatigue nystagmus.
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: + wheezes bilaterally, no rales or ronchi CV: NRRR no murmur Abdomen:  Distended, non-tender, hyperactive bowel sounds Ext: 3+ pitting edema, warm, well perfused, pulses auscultated with doppler.
New enlarged gastroesophageal lymph node, 23 x 19 mm, without  FDG-avidity.
Persistent mild FDG-avidity within the distal esophagus, likely post-treatment esophagitis and little changed.
New ascites, anasarca, and pleural effusion - possibly related to the patient's underlying liver disease or malnourished state, though malignant ascites cannot be excluded and correlation should be made with the patient's pending paracentesis cytology.
New and FDG-avid ground-glass opacity in the anterior left upper lobe, SUV max 4.8, likely inflammatory.
Small left pleural effusion, with bibasilar atelectasis.
New interval left retrocardiac opacity, atelectasis is favored however early pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2130-9-22**]  low voltage in the standard leads persists but it is even more prominent at this time.
The pattern of incomplete right bundle-branch block persists.
The patient has had a striking decrease in voltage in leads V4-V6 since the previous tracing.
Consider inferior and anterolateral myocardial infarctions of undetermined age.
[**12-8**] peritoneal fluid NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Shrunken nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis, but no focal liver lesion identified.
[**12-10**] bronchial washing NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Interval development of widespread patchy ground-glass opacities.
Given the rapidity of onset, this most likely represents an atypical infection or drug reaction.
Increased mass-like thickening of the distal esophagus compared to the [**Month (only) 216**] PET scan, with minimal interval increase in size of prevascular lymph nodes and gastroesophageal lymph nodes.
There is ascites and a nodular appearance of the mesentery, which may be due to worsening hepatic failure, but is also concerning for carcinomatosis.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-8-29**], no change  [**12-11**] abd film Findings are consistent with colonic ileus this can be seen in multiple etiologies including infectious (C.diff) or inflammatory colitis or ischemia.
No evidence of small or large bowel obstruction.
Cirrhotic liver with splenomegaly, ascites, and gastric varices.
Multifocal pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions.
Shrunken nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis, but no focal liver lesion identified.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Date range (1) 68077**]/[**2130**] 58 yo male with esophageal CA thought to be in remission and hepatitis C presents with dyspnea, ascites, pitting edema, and generalized weakness.
Was admitted to the MICU for hypotension in the ER and question of pneumonia.
#Dyspnea: Thought to be related to a combination of bilateral pleural effusions as well as a possible small pneumonia.
He also received a large volume paracentesis and was started on low dose diuretics for management of volume overload.
Shortly after reaching the medicine floor, he developed hypoxia to 89% on roomair, improved to 90% on 2L, then 98% on 2L.
CXR showed lower lobe opacities bilaterally.
There was concern that he may have had a PE given malignancy and coinciding tachycardia.
He was started on heparin gtt while transferring and he received a CTA which was negative for PE, but showed b/l ground-glass opacities concerning for ARDS.
He had a BNP, EKG, cardiac enzymes and TTE which did not reveal heart failure as contributory to respiratory distress.
Thought to be secondary to sepsis as well as third spacing in the setting of malnutrition.
Cortisol stimulation testing was inadequate, however pt has low albumin levels and therefore he would not be expected to have a sufficiently high total coritsol level.
His hypotension was volume responsive making adrenal insufficieny unlikely (although patient likely has long-standing adrenal insufficiency).
#Weakness: Likely due to infectious proces, liver disease and malignancy.
Management of liver disease and pneumonia as above.
#Abdominal distention: patient distended with air in bowel loops.
Treated with stress dose steroids while hypotensive and thought to be septic.
#Liver disease:  Known hepatitis C positive since age 17 secondary to IV drug use.
He had a right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed cirrhosis, ascites and patent vasculature.
He also underwent paracentesis which was negative for SBP.
Morphine Concentrate 20 mg/mL Solution Sig: 5-20 mg PO Q1H (every hour) as needed for pain, discomfort.
Disp:*20 Tablet(s), sublingual.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Hypotension (low blood pressure) Liver disease Esophageal cancer   Discharge Condition: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 68078**] went home to hospice care to allow him to be with his family and friends in the comfort of his home.
