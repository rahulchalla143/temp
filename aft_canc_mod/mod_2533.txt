The liver demonstrates minimal pneumobilia within the left lobe.
Arising from the caudate lobe of the liver is a hypodense rounded exophytic mass that measures 4.3 AP x 6.1 TV x 10.7 cc (2:25 and 601b:40).
It exerts minimal mass effect on the adjacent liver parenchyma and duodenum.
There is no surrounding inflammation.
Pancreas and adrenal glands show no masses or nodules.
The small and large bowel shows no evidence of obstruction or wall edema.
Neither kidney shows evidence of hydronephrosis.
There is no free air, free fluid, or lymphadenopathy.
There is no free fluid or lymphadenopathy.
Minimal degenerative disc disease is present in the lumbar spine.
Otherwise, there is no aggressive-appearing lytic or sclerotic lesion.
Status post cholecystectomy and gastric banding without evidence of free air or free fluid.
Portocaval mass as described above; evaluation with contrast-enhanced CT may be considered once the patient's renal function improves.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Trivial MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal views.
Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No clinically significant pericardial effusion.
Low normal global left ventricular systolic function.
No clinically significant valvular regurgitation or stenosis.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-10-2**], mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is no longer appreciated.
Due to the suboptimal image quality on the current study a comprehensive comparison of all other parameters could not be made.
No active bleeding was noted.
No bleeding was noted.
IMPRESSION: Normal mucosa in the esophagus Normal mucosa in the stomach (biopsy) Ulcer in the posterior duodenal bulb Duodenoscope was introduced and the site of previous sphincterotomy.
No bleeding was noted.
Repeat EGD in 4 weeks to document healing of duodenal ulcer.
If ulcer is persistent then obtain biopsies to rule out malignancy.
DISCHARGE LABS: [**2150-9-26**] 06:10AM BLOOD WBC-10.3# RBC-3.63* Hgb-11.7* Hct-33.6* MCV-93 MCH-32.1* MCHC-34.6 RDW-16.6* Plt Ct-220 [**2150-9-26**] 06:10AM BLOOD PT-11.8 PTT-27.3 INR(PT)-1.1 [**2150-9-26**] 06:10AM BLOOD Glucose-129* UreaN-17 Creat-1.2 Na-144 K-4.3 Cl-109* HCO3-26 AnGap-13   Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT: 75 year old male with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib on warfarin, PR prolongation s/p CCY and more recently ERCP with sphincterotomy for 1.5cm CBD stone, now presenting with syncope and hypotension, likely secondary to GI bleed.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:  ACTIVE ISSUES:  # GI bleed: He was initially admitted to the ICU with concern for active upper GI bleeding with evidence of a HCT drop and melena.
Due to a prior history of a transfusion reaction, he was pre -treated with diphenhydramine and transfused at a slower rate.
Had EGD with side viewing scope which showed cratered ulcer at Duodenal bulb.
# Hypotension: Due to a presumed ongoing GI bleed, he was admitted to the MICU for observation of his hypotension without tachycardia.
He was felt to be hypovolemic from the GI bleed and was resuscitated as above.
# Bradycardia/Syncope- His EKGs were initially concerning for a high-degree AV block, but review of the EKGs with the Cardiology service revealed atrial flutter with variable conduction (usually 3:1) as well as known PR prolongation.
TTE was done and showed stable EF and no effusion.
EP consulted who felt no acute intervention was needed.
# Atrial fibrillation/flutter: INR was supratherapeutic in setting of coumadin at presentation .Patient appears to have slow atrial flutter, per EP, and does not require EP intervention at this time.
INACTIVE ISSUES:  # CAD s/p CABG: Patient was w/o chest pain throughout.
No evidence of active/acute ischemia on EKG.
# Portacaval lesion: First noted on CT in [**2149**].
# Hypothyroidism (s/p thyroidectomy): Patient was maintined on home dose of levothyroxine.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - Full code - f/u pending EGD biopsies - f/u H Pylori, treat if positive - Repeat EGD in 4 weeks to evaluate healing and rule out malignancy - Re-initiation of coumadin on [**2150-9-28**] - goal INR [**2-6**] - Continued workup of portocaval mass   Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY Please restart this on [**2150-9-28**] only if you have no signs of bleeding or dark stool 2.
Warfarin 7.5 mg PO DAILY16 Please restart this on [**2150-9-28**] only if you have no signs of bleeding or dark stool.
Modify dose as directed by RN at [**Hospital 197**] Clinic   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: Acute blood loss anemia GI bleed Atrial fibrillation/flutter   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted with passing out and low blood pressures.
You had an upper endoscopy which showed a large ulcer in your intestines which was not actively bleeding, but we believe this was the source of your bleeding.
You may restart these medications on Monday [**9-28**] if you are still feeling well and have no signs of bleeding or dark stools.
You were also noted to have a slow heart rate at times.
