Patient with known esophageal CA s/p resection in [**4-/2108**] with recurrence in [**2110**] s/p chemotherapy (last [**2112-2-4**]) who has been having increased shortness of breath for the past 2 months.
Patient intially felt to have bronchitis and treated with antibiotics without improvement of symptoms.
He underwent biopsy of L main bronchus which showed espohageal adenocarcinoma along the wall.
One day PTA patient CXR showed opacification of L chest and had bronch on [**2112-3-3**] which showed LMS obstruction.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with septal, anterior and apical akinesis and hypokinesis elsewhere.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Cardiac cath ([**2112-3-4**]): Bronchoscopy w/ biopsy ([**2112-3-4**]):  [**2112-3-8**]: ECHO: Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the septum and apex (EF 40-45%).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion, without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
In the PACU patient became hypertensive and tachycardic to 120s with LBBB pattern.
A CXR was obtained which was consistent with b/l pulmonary edema.
An emergent TTE was done which showed severe LV systolic dysfunction with LVEF < 20%, no tamponade, perserved RV systolic function.
He was maintained on norepinephrine and dobutamine drips overnight to maintain his BP in the setting of his cardiogenic shock.
Overnight between hospital days 1 and 2, he became acutely tachycardic to the 140s with a stable BP and a moderate drop in his cardiac index.
ECGs were suggestive of atrial tachycardia and he was electricallu cardioverted on the morning of hospital day #2 under the supervision of the cardiology attending.
On HD#3 he was bronched and found to have malignant airway obstruction s/p stent placement for post-obstructive PNA.
