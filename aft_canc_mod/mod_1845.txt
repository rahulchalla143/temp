Patient's CT scan at OSH showed a near obstructing RUL lung mass, which on subsequent biopsy turned out to be a squamous cell CA.
On [**4-24**], she underwent a laser resection of her lung mass in a palliative attempt to open up her RLL, RML and RUL.
She suffered an extensive endobronchial burn injury.
Subsequent to that, she developed a large R pleural effusion, underwent CT-guided drainage with pigtail cath placement, which itself was complicated by a tension PTX, leading to eventual chest tube placement.
She was later felt to have a L PTX from barotrauma, and underwent a L chest tube placement.
Subsequent bronch showed tumor starting to grow in the distal trachea, distorting the opening of the R main bronchus.
Despite this, her resp status worsened, with increasing tachypnea and air hunger, which they felt was from near obstruction of the distal trachea as visualized by another bronch.
Furthermore, she wanted the pt transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a second opinion and possible therapeutic measures.
Supraventricular tachycardia.
No history of alcohol.
Family History: Notable for diabetes and cancer.

#Hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure:  This was felt to be due to combination of lung injury from smoke inhalation with capillary leak, bilateral pneumonia, volume overload and airway disease secondary to lobar collapse with lung cancer.
She required pressure control ventilation with maximum pressure and oxygenation support.
Repeat bronchoscopy [**2160-6-4**] showed diffuse eschar with with sluffing mucosa, lingula obstructed by pseudomembrane, no bleeding.
She was diuresed as blood pressure tolerated, but by day three became hypotensive requiring pressor support.
LENIs were performed to evaluate for PE and were negative.
Cortisol stimulation test was negative indicating no adrenal insufficiency.
#Elevated wbc/fever: Patient was noted to have bilateral infilatrates on chest x-ray and urinalysis consistent with infection.
Additionally there was a report of stenotrophomonus infection at the OSH that was not seen on BAL or sputum culture at [**Hospital1 18**].
She was in rapid afib [**2160-6-6**], but otherwise remained in sinus, sinus tachycardia.
b) Coronaries: no h/o CAD c) Pump: no prior history of CHF.
volume overloaded with continued urine output.
#DM: patient was kept on insulin gtt for tight glucose control.
# Anemia: stools were guiaic negative.
anemia was thought to be due to chronic inflammation.
#Buttocks: Decubitus ulcer was treated with accuzyme and dressed daily .
#FEN: patient continued ot have high residuals while on paralytics.
