Perihepatic and right paracolic ascites extending into the pelvis.
There is a high-density collection adjacent to the anastomotic sutures of the transverse colon likely representing postoperative hematoma.
High-density material within the pelvis also likely represents postoperative clot.
There is no pneumoperitoneum or leakage of oral contrast.
Dilated loops of small bowel, likely represent postoperative ileus.
Right lower lobe consolidation consistent with provided history of pneumonia.
Small right pleural effusion.
Free intraperitoneal air communicating with intracolonic air adjacent to the anastomotic site, concerning for anastomotic leak.
Free intraperitoneal air tracking through the rectus muscle just to the right of midline with increased anterior midline subcutaneous air, concerning for wound dehiscence.
Probable small bowel ileus.
Improved but persistent right lower lobe opacity with resolved right pleural effusion, consistent with improving right lower lobe pneumonia.
No evidence of hydronephrosis, no evidence for renal artery stanosis 2.
Elevated resistive indices in the interlobular and main renal arteries bilaterally is consistent with a parenchymal process such as glomerulonephritis, interstitiell nephritis or diabetic nephropathy  CT Torso [**2108-11-26**]: 1.
Organized appearance of a previously present hematoma or hemorrhagic fluid collection extending from the right upper quadrant to the deep pelvis.
While this may simply represent organized hematoma or ascitic fluid, an abscess cannot be excluded.
Diffuse distention of small bowel, likely related to ileus.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted for elective right colectomy for colonic polyp that could not be removed  on colonoscopy.
He had multiple episodes of emesis and then developed visual hallucinations at this time.
By the time he was transferred back to the floor on POD 8 he was conversing coherently and required no haldol/ativan.
He had no further events with respect to his neurologic status through discharge.
CV: He was noted to become tachycardic on POD2.
He was asymptomatic but had troponins cycled that were negative.
The following day he continued to be tachycardic and had his troponins cycled again, which were negative.
This was in the setting of now [**Doctor Last Name **] on CIWA and increased agitation.
Resp: He has underlying COPD and was noted to be wheezy requiring frequent nebulizer treatments with both ipratropium and albuterol.
On POD 4 he had increased work of breathing and tachypnea, had a CTA that showed no PE but confirmed RLL PNA.
He had no respiratory distress after his time in the ICU and was discharged on budesonide until he sees Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his pulmonologist, on discharge.
GI: He had return of flatus on POD3 and was slowly advanced in his diet until he developed emesis on POD4.
He had a CT scan of his abdomen on PO6 that showed free fluid in the abdomen.
On POD 12 he had a CT scan of his abdomen performed for persistent leukocytosis despite being afebrile.
This showed an anastomotic fluid/air collection and superficial air collection above the fascia.
The wound was opened at bedside.
The next day patient had IR drain placed next to anastomosis, enterocutaneous fistula was confirmed, and a VAC was placed on the opened vertical abdominal incision.
He had one episode of emesis on POD 15 and was moved back to clears with Enlive supplements and given some MIVF.
GU: Initially had low urine output on POD 1.
Because of his underlying COPD he was then maintained at even fluid status thereafter, which pulmonary consult team agreed with.
On POD 19 he was noted to have acute decrease in urine output with subsequent rise in Creatinine.
A foley was placed and his urine output returned to [**Location 213**] with gentle hydration.
He had urine cultures sent when he initially spiked to 102, which showed no growth.
On POD 6 his peritoneal fluid showed no microorganisms and no polys on gram stain.
He had blood cultures sent on POD 6 that showed no growth.
On POD 13 the peri-anastomotic collection was cultured and showed [**Female First Name (un) 564**] Albicans, sensitive to fluconazole and patient was continued on vanc/zosyn until he had acute drop in renal function with subsequent decrease in his WBC.
Vanc and zosyn were stopped as stated above and patient remained afebrile off antibiotics.
He was also restarted on cipro/flagyl for persistent leukocytosis after his ATN began to resolve.
TLD: Patient had epidural removed on POD 3 in setting of new infection.
Disp:*1 inhaler* Refills:*1* 4. calcium carbonate 200 mg calcium (500 mg) Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for heartburn.
Your right colon and surrounding lymph nodes were removed and sent to the pathology department, and showed no signs of malignancy.
Post-operatively you were found to have a high heart rate and were given medications to lower this.
You also had studies done to make sure you were not having a heart attack and all were negative.
In the setting of a high heart rate you also developed breathing difficulties and were being given frequent breathing treatments to help with this.
You also developed signs of alcohol withdrawal and were given medication to limit the extent of this withdrawal.
Due to all of the above issues you were transferred to the ICU so that you could be watched very closely.
You were also started on antibiotics  for pneumonia and you fisnished an appropriate course at the time of discharge.
You were found to have a small leak from the surgical site and this connected to the skin.
This required drainage in interventional radiology twice and opening of the abdominal incision and vac placment to control the fistula.
You were passing gas and having bowel movements with good pain control at the time of discharge.
You have tolerated a regular diet, passing gas and your pain is controlled with pain medications by mouth.
?s to have some decrease in bowel function but you should not have prolonged constipation.

Please monitor the site for signs of infection: increased drainage around the tube, increased pain at the site, fever, increased pain at the site.
You have a site in the lower right quadrant where there was a drain in place that was done by the interventional radiologists.
This has a dry sterile dressing over the site and this can be removed 24 hours after drain removal.
Please call the office if this site begins to show signs of infection listed above or bleeds.
You developed renal failure during your hospital admission and you were followed closely by nephrology.
