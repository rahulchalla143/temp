Distended gallbladder with surrounding pericholecystic fat stranding is concerning for acute cholecystitis.
6 mm nodule in the left adrenal gland (2:25) is indeterminate.
Colonic diverticulosis with no diverticulitis.
Small hiatal hernia.
Fibrotic changes of the inferior lung most compatible with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
Decreased intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation status post bile duct stent placement.
[**2125-1-20**] LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US: Targeted grayscale and color evaluation of the gallbladder was performed.
A small amount of perihepatic fluid is noted.
IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for acute cholecystitis.
[**2125-1-20**] CXR: Findings consistent with chronic interstitial lung disease.
No definite change.
[**2125-1-24**] Chest CT: Since the prior chest CT in [**11-20**], there is marked worsening of extensive, geographic ground glass opacities bilaterally, but worse on the left.
Given the asymmetric distribution, a superimposed process such as pulmonary edema is less likely, and this appearance is not characteristic of infection.
DIAGNOSIS: Bile:  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Bile pigment and debris only.
MICROBIOLOGY: [**2125-1-21**] 2:30 pm BILE                              **FINAL REPORT [**2125-1-24**]**     GRAM STAIN (Final [**2125-1-21**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on [**2125-1-21**] for evaluation of severe abdominal pain.
Upon admission, he was made NPO, started on IV fluids, started on empiric IV Unasyn, a foley catheter was placed, and he was given IV Dilaudid PRN for pain with good effect.
Admission CXR revealed chronic interstitial lung disease without definite change.
Abdominal CT showed a distended gallbladder with surrounding pericholecystic fat stranding is concerning for acute cholecystitis.
Abdominal Ultrasound findings consistent with acute cholecystitis.
Later that day, he underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement with drainage of 145 cc of dark bilious material, which was successful.
The Pulmonary Service was consulted for pre-operative evealuation given his history of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF).
On [**2125-1-24**], the patient began experiencing increased dyspnea requiring increased oxygen demand from his home baseline of 4.5 liters by nasal prong to maintain oxygen saturation at 92-93%.
A Chest CT was ordered, which showed new diffuse ground-glass opacity, superimposed upon worsened background interstitial lung abnormality, most consistent with progression of UIP, less likely superimposed pulmonary edema.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2168**] (Pulmonary) had communicated ealier to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (Surgery) that the patient had experienced a flare of the IPF and that surgery would no longer be an option.
He was discharged home with appropriate pain and anxiolytic medications as well as home oxygen equipment.
