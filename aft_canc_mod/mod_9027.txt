Surveillance cultures were sent off on [**2191-3-11**], to assess for clearing of the bacteremia and final report noted no growth from these cultures.
In addition, the patient continued to have several episodes of diarrhea daily and was treated with a ten day course of p.o.
On this regimen, the patient's diarrhea improved markedly and at the time of discharge, the patient had resolved for the most part with the patient having an occasional loose bowel movement.
Cardiac:  Echocardiogram obtained on [**2191-3-10**], noted an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%, with decreased overall left ventricular systolic function.
This was noted to be a marked change from prior study and it was deemed likely that the patient's shortness of breath and cough was secondary to congestive heart failure.
At that time, beta blockers were deferred due to concern for possible bacteremia leading to sepsis and the detrimental effect of the beta blocker in that situation.
The patient's shortness of breath and cough were noted to improve on this regimen and the patient's O2 saturations were consistently in the mid-90's on room air.
