The patient reports that she had some cranberry juice.
Thereafter she started having multiple episodes of dry heaves, periumbilical cramping pain and subsequent hematemesis.
She developed a diffuse body rash.
She never had compromised of her respiratory function.

CT Abdomen: FINDINGS: The lung bases demonstrate no nodular densities or focal opacities.
The liver is mildly low in attenuation diffusely consistent with fatty liver.
No pericholecystic fluid or stranding noted.
Again demonstrated is a right-sided hydronephrosis with a soft tissue density surrounding the right mid ureter just cephalad to the sacral promontory.
There are multiple fluid filled and mildly dilated loops of small bowel.
Grouped small bowel loops make identification of a discrete transition point difficult.
The colon contains air and stool extending all the way to the colostomy site within the left lower quadrant.
There is wide-mouth parastomal hernia with no evidence of incarceration as on prior study.
There are multiple omental metastatic lesions as demonstrated on prior study similar in size.
The sigmoid colon contains multiple diverticula with no evidence of diverticulitis.
There are no soft tissue foci within the perirectal space.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.
Multiple moderately distended loops of small bowel with air fluid levels with no transition point identified.
There is a small portion of terminal ileum that is collapsed.
A small bowel series under fluoroscopy may be of benefit.
Mass lesion abutting mid right ureter as above suspicious for metastatic disease.
Stable-appearing parastomal hernia.
No evidence of incarceration  Brief Hospital Course: Hospital Course by Problem: .
#UGIB:  DDX included peptic ulcer disease (given ?duodenal inflammation on CT), AVMs, worsening of metastatic disease, or viral gastroenteritis causing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 329**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear (esp given hx of prolongued dry heaves).
While on the floor she had no further episodes of hematemesis or blood ostomy output.
Conferring with her oncologist, this was thought to represent metastatic disease encasing the ureter.
She will follow up with her oncologist for systemic chemotherapy.
?SBO:  several days into the hosptialization, she developed worsening abdominal pain and distention.
KUB showed a few moderately dilated loops of small bowel thought to represent early obstruction.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Tear) R sided hydronephrosis; stable from prior CT scan  Secondary Diagnoses: Stage IV colon CA ( s/p right hemicolectomy and diverting colostomy) GERD Iron Deficiency Anemia Hypothyroidism Depression h/o Stomal Cellulitis Asthma   Discharge Condition: stable, tolerating full POs   Discharge Instructions: Please contact your primary care doctor should you develop any fevers, chills, sweats, abdominal pain, blood in your vomit or stool, black stools, or any other serious complaints.
