His son who witnessed the event states that the patient had no LOC.
Head CT showed extensive SAH and SDH and a L temporal bone fracture, and the patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Patient had no prodrome or preceeding palpitations, chest pain, dizziness, headaches, no recent fever or chills, and no visual changes.
No seizure or fall history.
Patient had a TIA 2 weeks ago characterized by slurred speech.
The patient was admitted to neurosurgery, but due to the extensive bleed, there were no surgical options, so he was medically managed with seizure prophylaxis.
Patient was on lasix gtt for volume overload.
Community ambulator with a cane.
Family History: father died of MI, mother had diabetes  Physical Exam: Vitals: Tm 100.2 Tc 98.0 BP 116/55;116-150/55-72 HR 76; 70-110's RR 20-24 94% O2 on 5L FSG 281 Gen: somnelent but arousable, awake, alert, AOx1 (only to person, at home in [**Location (un) 47**], [**2130-3-8**]) HEENT: PEERL 2mm bilaterally, EOMI, full visual fields, no nystagmus, dry oral mucous membranes.
Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage seen within the frontal lobes bilaterally, right frontal lobe, left parietal lobe.
Layering blood also seen within the lateral ventricles.
Intraparenchymal contusion/hemorrhage seen within the anterior frontal lobes bilaterally.
Subdural hematoma seen in the frontal regions bilaterally, and tracking along the falx.
Nondisplaced fractures of the left temporal bone, with associated hemotympanum.
[**2130-2-9**] Cardiac ECHO: Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Neurosurgery was consulted and no surgical intervention was indicated because of extensive nature of SDH and SAH and poor prognosis.
Repeat head CT on [**2-8**] showed no significant interval change.
He was started on phenytoin 100mg po tid for seizure prophylaxis.
#NSTEMI: Patient had NSTEMI on [**2-7**].
EKG showed diffuse ST depressions.
Per cardiology, patient was not a good candidate for catherization because of his extensive SAH and SDH such that he could not be placed on anti-platlet therapy afterwards.
No anti-coagulation or anti-platlet therapy added.
Family discussion confirmed DNR/DNI status and patient preference for non-invasive care.
On [**2-8**], CK-MB elevated to 88 and troponin elevated to 2.78.
He was monitored on telemetry and had episodes of paroxysmal SVT to 120's, otherwise HR well controlled to 60's.
#SOB: Patient with desats to 70-80's on [**2130-2-10**] at night thought to be due to flash pulmonary edma secondary to diastolic heart failure and NSTEMI on [**2-7**].
EKG showed ST depression in anterolateral leads.
Due to concern for aspiration and mucous plugging, tube feeds were held and chest PT and deep suctioning were performed with improved respiratory status.
During family discussion, patient began agonal breathing and passed away.
#Pneumonia: On [**2130-2-10**], there was concern for aspiration PNA due to persistent R lower lobe hazy opacity since admission, low grade fever to 100.8, and increased cough.
The patient had persistent leukocytosis due to CLL.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation, moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is seen.
He was on lisinopril 5mg daily on admission which was discontinued due to rising creatinine.
Patient was on leukoram 2mg daily on admission, this was held during admission due to acute medical issues and was to be restarted on discharge.
Fractional excretion Urea: 18% based on urine electrolytes indicated creatinine rise likely due to pre-renal disease.
#Anemia: Patient has chronic anemia per prior PCP notes due to CLL and iron deficiency.
#DMII: Patient had hyperglycemia during hospital course, transiently on insulin gtt.
He was on glargine 10u daily and RISS with QID FSBG.
Glargine was decreased to 5u when patient's tube feeds were held on [**2130-2-11**] due to concern for aspiration.
Tube feeds were held on [**2130-2-10**] due to concern for aspiration.
#PPX: Patient was on pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.
