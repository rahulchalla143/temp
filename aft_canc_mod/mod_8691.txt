CXR: A small right pleural effusion with associated relaxation atelectasis at the right lung base.
Minimal left base atelectasis.
Large globular heart, question possible underlying pericardial effusion  TTE: [**2172-2-20**] The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8 cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion appears loculated (mostly posterior to the LV).
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or large territorial infarct.
Unchanged microvascular ischemic disease.
KUB [**2172-2-19**] FINDINGS: There is no free air.
There is a nonspecific bowel gas pattern, without evidence of ileus or obstruction.
There is an S-shaped scoliosis in the lumbar spine.
IMPRESSION: No ileus, obstruction or free air.
Flow and waveforms in the bilateral subclavian veins appear symmetric.
There is no intraluminal thrombus identified within the right subclavian vein.
Flow in the right basilic is absent, while minimal residual flow is seen in the right axillary vein adjacent to the intramural thrombus.
IMPRESSION: Acute deep venous thrombosis involving the right axillary, brachial, and basilic veins.
Obscuration of the left liver lobe.
Visualized liver parenchyma appears normal.
Decompressed gallbladder, with no stones, sludge, wall thickening, or pericholecystic fluid.
Mild gallbladder wall thickening appreciated on the prior examination has resolved.
No biliary dilatation.
Brief Hospital Course: 85 year old male admitted with altered mental status and had afib with [**Month/Year (2) 5509**].
# AMS - Altered mental status improved modestly with IV fluids.
Ongoing confusion was thought to be likely from an infectious process (pna vs. UTI vs. C. diff colitis).
No evidence of stroke or seizure.
No evidence of CHF exacerbation on exam, no HTN encephalopathy.
No evidence of hypoxia or hypercarbia.
Elevated LFTs likely shock liver during last admission, which might have contributed to the altered mental status.
# Atrial fibrillation - Patient had baseline afib, with [**Month/Year (2) 5509**] to the 130s shortly after admission.
The decision had been made previously by his CPC not to anticoagulate him given a history of multiple falls and hx of difficultly controlling his INR as an out pt.
# Pneumonia: CXR showed RLL consolidation.
Given a rising lactate and multiple medical co-morbidities, he was transferred to the ccu.
Blood and sputum cultures as well as urinary legionella antigen were negative.
KUB did not show free air or dilated loops.
Abdominal pain resolved.
# Systolic heart failure/severe aortic stenosis: Patient had a history of systolic heart failure, EF 30% on [**2172-2-4**].
He had no evidence of acute heart failure this admission, with stable BP.
Repeat echo showed slightly improved EF at 35% and worsening of valve disease (severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and moderate to severe aortic stenosis with valve area .8%).
Pt is not a canidate for valve replacement.
However, if his mental status imporves in the future, he can be evaluated for a palliative valvuloplasty.
# Coronaries: no chest pain, negative CEs.
No active issues.
# Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Patient had a history of CKD with baseline creatinine in ~1.5.
# Elevated LFTs: AST and ALT were lower than last admission but AP and tbili higher, likely due to shock liver from hypotension.
He had already had an unrevealing hepatitis and autoimmune workup during last admission.
Showed improvement of gallbladder thickness from last admission.
LFTs should be rechecked as an outpatient, however, no acute intervention is indicated.
# Elevated INR: INR was initially 2.6, up from 1.3 at discharge on [**2172-2-11**].
This was likely [**3-9**] liver disease and malnutrition.
There were no signs of active bleeding.
Ultrasound showed extensive upper extremity thrombis involving the axillary, brachial, and basilic veins.
Coumadin not started due to hx of difficult to control INR, and concurrent liver disease which elevated INR.
[**Name (NI) **] did not have capacity during his admission.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed: hold for loose stool.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1186**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Pneumonia Severe aortic stenosis Acute on chronic renal failure Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis, right side .
Obstructive sleep apnea Chronic systolic heart failure Hypertension Elevated liver function testes secondary to shock liver   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, afebrile, confused, requiring BiPAP at night   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] due to confusion.
You were found to have a pneumonia and increased heart rate with your atrial fibrillation.
You also had dehydration that had worsened your kidney fuctin, this was treated with IV fluids.
You developed a blood clot in your right arm veins, for which you were started on lovenox to thin your blood.
