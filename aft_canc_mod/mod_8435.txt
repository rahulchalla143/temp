Findings are consistent with acute hemorrhage of hepatic adenoma, with extensive perihepatic hemoperitoneum extending around the inferior edge of the liver.
Gallbladder wall thickening consistent with adenomyomatosis as seen on previous ultrasound.
No evidence of acute cholecystitis.
No other abnormalities noted on non-contrast exam.
Arteriogram [**2-2**]: Celiac, SMA and hepatic arteriograms demonstrated the presence of a single hypervascular adenoma in the segment VI of the liver.
No evidence of active extravasation from the known hepatic adenomas.
No findings to suggest an abscess in the abdomen or pelvis.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient initially admitted to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] surgical service with diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.
Given initial presentation with acute onset epigastric pain, US ordered and results showing multiple hepatic lesions in a patient with known hepatic adenomatosis; heterogeneous lesion inferiorly, with a moderate amount of fluid in the abdomen is concerning for rupture and hemorrhage of adenoma; gallbladder mucosal irregularity and ringdown artifact indicating adenomyomatosis.
No evidence to suggest cholecystitis.
CT scan ordered to further evaluate lesions and results showed acute hemorrhage of hepatic adenoma, with extensive perihepatic hemoperitoneum extending around the inferior edge of the liver; gallbladder wall thickening consistent with adenomyomatosis as seen on previous ultrasound without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Plastic surgery also consulted for possible compartment syndrome to left forearm.
Started on flagyl and cipro for empiric coverage.
Initial signs of continued bleeding as Hct decreasing from 34.4 - 30.7 - 23.2 - 22.6.
Clinically asymptomatic except for some abdominal tenderness.
Results showing hemoperitoneum now predominantly located around segment VI of the liver and in the pelvis, no active extrav, no abscess.
