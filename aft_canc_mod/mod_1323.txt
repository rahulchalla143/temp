He was started on ceftazidime 2 gm IV q8h, and IV colistin at 150 mg IV q 12 hours, and continued on inhaled colistin 75 mg (given hx of recurrent pseudomonas PNAs).
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] (his ID doctor) was called by [**Hospital1 **] this morning with report of increasing oxygen requirement, blocked feeding tube, and leukocytosis to 17.5.
Also reportedly had an VBG with a pH of 7.20, PCO2 of 68 on [**8-14**].
He acutely became short of breath at [**Hospital1 **] today in the setting of having increased cough and pulmonary secretions, and increasing WBC, so was brought to the ED for evaluation.
CXR showed a retrocardiac opacity stable from prior.
On admission he denied shortness of breath, pain, or other symptoms.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: - [**4-/2154**] p/w fevers, night sweats, and weight loss in the setting of a left inguinal lymph node.
- Bx grade II/III follicular lymphoma.
- Treated with six cycles of CHOP/Rituxan with good response, but showed evidence for relapse in [**12/2154**] and was treated with MINE chemotherapy for two cycles.
- Multiple GI bleeds requiring ICU admissions and multiple transfusions and embolization of his bleeding.
- Noted to have CNS lesions felt consistent with PTLD and this was treated with a course of Rituxan.
No evidence for recurrence  of the PTLD.
- Acute liver GVHD, on CellCept, prednisone, and photophoresis.
- [**2157-12-28**] Photophoresis was d/c'd due to episodes of bacteremia and eventual removal of his apheresis catheter.
- [**2158-6-13**] restarted photopheresis on a weekly basis on , but then discontinued this again on [**2158-9-7**] as this was felt not to be making any impact on his liver function tests.
- undergone phlebotomy due to iron overload with corresponding drop in his ferritin.
He has continued with transient rises in his transaminases and bilirubin and has remained on varying doses of CellCept and prednisone which has been slowly tapered over the time.
- [**2159-1-19**] admission due to increasing right hip pain.
MRI revealed edema and infiltrating process in the psoas muscle bilaterally.
After extensive workup, this was felt related to an  infection and required several admissions with completion of antibiotics in 03/[**2158**].
- [**7-/2160**]: Last scans showed no evidence for lymphoma and he has  remained in remission.
-In [**5-/2161**], noted to have tiny echogenic nodule on abdominal [**Year (4 digits) 950**].
MRI of the liver also showed this nodule but was not  as concerning on review and he is due to have a repeat MRI imaging in early [**Month (only) **].
-On [**2161-8-3**], worsening cough and was noted to have a small new pneumothorax in the left apical area.
This has essentially resolved over time - Issues with weight loss (followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]); multiple tests done with no etiology found; question malabsorption related to GVHD - Has on and off respiratory infections and has been treated with antibiotics (now colistin inhaled and IV) for resistant pseudomonas.
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p allo SCT 2.
Grade 4 Acute GVHD of GI/liver following DLI with GI bleed, chronic transaminitis, portal HTN with esophageal varices (not able to band) 3.
History of intracranial lesions felt consistent with PTLD.

Multifocal predominantly peribronchovascular nodular and ground-glass opacities, suggestive of an infectious process which is improved in certain areas and unchanged to worst in certain other areas.
Atypical infections are a consideration.
Smaller right and unchanged small left pleural effusion and more confluent left lower lobe opacity, could be atelectasis or consolidative manifestation of the infectious process.
Coronary artery calcifications including vascular calcifications, atypical in this age group.
Three sclerotic left sided rib lesions, two of which are new, could represent lymphomatous involvement.

# PNA: He presented for this hospital admission with increasing sputum production, increasing respiratory requirements, and SOB.
His admission sputum culture grew out multidrug resistant pseudomonas, sensitive to amikacin and intermediate for ceftazadine.
In response to these sensitivities, the patient was restarted on ceftazadine (with extended infusion times in order to maximize time dependent bacterial killing) and his doripenem was stopped.
At this point, the patient had increasing secretions in setting of a WCC spike, bandemia and fever.
It was believed that this represented evolving resistance to ceftazadine versus a new infection not otherwise covered.
Patient had clinical improvement, with WCC trending down, afebrile status, ability to tolerate assist control on ventilator.
Given the tendency of crushed cellcept pills to clog the patients dobhoff, he is only able to receive cellcept suspension.
However, his oncologist felt that it would be reasonable to stop cellcept for a short time.
# s/p alloSCT complicated by GVHD:  He was transitioned to PO Predinisone.
His LFTs have an elevated baseline [**1-26**] to GVHD, but were noted to be trending upward during the course of this hospitalization.
# Chronic anemia: Hct of 30 on admission with baseline in the mid to high 20's.
He was asymptomatic and did not require any transfusions.
