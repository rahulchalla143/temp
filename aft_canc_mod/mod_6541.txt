Otherwise, the patient is unable to provide much history; however, she did have some pain with palpation of her right upper quadrant.
Neither the patient nor her wife can remember any trauma to her left leg (though she had a recent fall with a fracture of her left humerus).
She was noted to have a large area of erythema and tenderness to palpation of the left lower extremity that was marked which involved a large portions of her calf as well as her distal thigh.
CT scan of her abdomen showed a small gallbladder, making cholecystitis unlikely although not completely excluded; with hyperdense contents which suggest stones or sludge.
Fatty liver and splenomegaly: although splenomegaly is not specific, concern is raised for steatohepatitis or cirrhosis.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.

Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] followed by [**Last Name (LF) 1852**], [**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]   Social History: Ms. [**Known lastname 82967**] lives with her wife in [**Location (un) 83264**], [**State 350**].
She has an odd affect with tangential thinking.
Inattentive and unable to do months of the year in reverse HEENT - NC/AT, EOMI, sclerae anicteric, Adentulous, MMM, OP clear NECK - supple, no [**Doctor First Name **], no thyromegaly, no JVD, no carotid bruits  LUNGS - CTA bilaterally, moving air well and symmetrically HEART - S1 S2 clear and of good quality, tachycardic, 3/6 SEM RUSB ABDOMEN - NABS, Obese, soft/NT/ND, no masses or HSM EXTREMITIES - WWP, 2+ peripheral pulses (radials, DPs).
Chronic venous stasis skin changed on bilateral LE.
Left lower leg with significant erythema from knee to groing along medial aspect tracking in a linear pattern along medial aspect of thigh.
Marked fatty infiltration of the pancreas, which can be seen as a manifestation of chronic pancreatic inflammation, although other etiologies such as cystic fibrosis could generate such an appearance.
Mild-to-moderate splenomegaly including small infarcts.
Splenomegaly in association with fatty liver may raise concern for steatohepatitis or cirrhosis with portal hypertension as the etiology for splenomegaly, although the appearance is not entirely specific.
Although no complex features are apparent based on CT imaging, particularly based on size and the limitations of CT assessment, when clinically appropriate, evaluation with ultrasound is recommended.
Mild left inguinal lymphadenopathy, likely reactive; correlation with physical findings involving the left lower extremity is recommended.
LENI [**4-3**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis either right or left lower extremity.
Findings above of subcutaneous edema and circumferential skin thickening, which in the right clinical setting may represent [**Month/Year (2) **].
No focal fluid collections to suggest abscess.
No subcutaneous emphysema.
Scattered degenerative changes of the left lower extremity.
CXR [**4-3**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2168-8-25**], there is little change.
Continued low lung volumes most likely account for the prominence of the cardiac silhouette.
No pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 82967**] is a 59 y/o female with a history of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], hypertension and chronic pain who presented with altered mental status and [**Doctor First Name **].
Non-purulent, no necrosis on CT.  Tx initially with Vancomycin/Levofloxacin given allergy profile (anaphylaxis to PCNs and Clindamycin).
LENI was negative for DVT.
Although cephalosporin regimen would be most optimal, due to severe reaction type and potential crossreactivity, vancomycin was selected for treatment.
# Altered mental status.
Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy secondary to the patient's left leg [**Hospital1 **].
Head CT not suggestive of hemorrhage.
# LFTs: Isolated ALP elevation associated with slightly elevated T.Bili to 1.2 from 0.5.
AST also elevated but ALT flat would suspect mitochondrial dysfunction.
In ED patient complained of RUQ pain and nausea consitent with cholecystitis.
CT scan could not definitely rule out cholecystitis.
Patient has habitus and epidemiology for cholelithiasis but with improved mental status she has no RUQ pain or [**Doctor Last Name **] sign on exam with improvement in mental status so did not pursue a second RUQ US.
Fever curve also improved on only Vancomycin without GNR or anaerobic coverage.
#  Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia to 120s consistently in the MICU.
Initially thought related to sepsis but did not improve with downtrend of fever curve or improvement in [**Doctor Last Name **].
Patient with chronic pain on Methadone so pain may be contributing as well.
Low likelihood for PE without hypoxia, tachypnea, chest pain and LENIs negative for DVT.
# Hypertension: Chronic, Lisinopril recently restarted with resolution of sepsis but she remained hypertensive.
Day of discharge she became hypotensive and orthostatic which, per patient's wife, usually happens when increasing BP meds.
# DJD/chronic pain: Continue methadone but tizanidine and gabapentin were initially held in setting of delirium but restarted prior to discharge  # [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
# Incidentalomas: Splenic infarcts likely PCV related in addition to splenomegaly.
Large right adenexal cyst can be worked up as outpatient  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Follow up incidentalomas, patient should have adenexal cyst monitored as an outpatient - Better control of hypertension is essential in this patient - Careful with BP meds given profound orthostasis when starting CCB - CODE STATUS: Presumed Full - CONTACT: Wife and HCP [**Name (NI) 636**] [**Name (NI) 82967**] [**0-0-**]   Medications on Admission: - lisinopril 40 mg PO BID - methadone 20 mg PO QID - methadone 10 mg PO Daily - tizanidine 4 mg PO TID - tizanidine 2 mg PO BID - gabapentin 600 mg PO Q4H - lorazepam 0.5 mgPO Q4H as needed for anxiety - Plavix 75 mg Tablet PO once a day - Colace 100 mg PO twice a day as needed for constipation  Discharge Medications: 1. docusate sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1) dose PO BID (2 times a day).

You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] because of confusion and an infection in the skin of your thigh.
You were initially admitted to the ICU because of concern for sepsis and you were treated with IV antibiotics with improvement in mental status and skin infection.
The following changes to your medications were made: - START Bactrim 2 DS tablets twice daily until [**2171-4-11**] - DECREASE your lisinopril to 40mg tabs, 1 tab daily - No other changes were made, please continue taking your home medications as previously prescribed  Followup Instructions: Name: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 177**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 83266**], MD Specialty: Primary Care When: Friday [**4-12**] at 11:30am Location: [**Hospital3 **] HEALTH CENTER Address: [**Street Address(2) 83267**], [**Location (un) **],[**Numeric Identifier 17464**] Phone: [**0-0-**]
