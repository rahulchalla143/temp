He is a 66 year-old man with known past medical history but who has not brought medical care for many years who was brought to [**Hospital3 **] [**12-2**] of shortness of breath times several weeks.
Upon arrival patient was found to have an oxygen saturation in the 70s, was cyanotic, discovered on imaging to have a large right sided pleural effusion with white-out of the right hemithorax.
A right chest tube was placed after intubation with greater than 4 liters of serosanguinous fluid drained.
Subsequent CT of the chest showed complete obstruction of the right main stem bronchus with right effusion and total right lung collapse.
He also had a left effusion of moderate size with atelectasis of the left lung posteriorly at lingula.
Patient also was severely hypercapnic on presentation with pCO2 of 85 and a pH of 7.2.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Decreased breath sounds over entire right side, and decreased breath sounds at the left base.
No wheezes, rhonchi or rales.
Abdomen: question of paradoxical abdominal movements with respiration.
Extremities:  Edematous hands but nonedematous feet, cyanosis cool fingers bilaterally.
Patient with clubbing of his toes bilaterally.
CT of the chest showed extremely large right sided pleural effusion with right lung collapse suspicious for underlying tumor, right chest tube in place, moderate size left pleural effusion with subsequent atelectasis, posterior left lung and lingula.
Small pericardial effusion, no evident pulmonary embolism and small ascites.
Chest x-ray shows significant change from prior films with large right pleural effusion opacifying entire right hemithorax.
Small left effusion and an endotracheal tube and orogastric tube in satisfactory positions.
Electrocardiogram showed diffusely low voltage, normal sinus rhythm at 65, flat T waves throughout, T waves in V1 through V3.
Cytology from 3 cc of pleural fluid came back negative for malignancy.
Endobronchial biopsy performed at [**Hospital1 **] - 3 cc of right effusion sent for cytology which was negative for malignancy.
His right main stem lesion was debulked and the right main stem bronchial stent was placed although his right lung remained collapsed [and his right chest tube drainage increased slightly but his right effusion remains large.
He also had a moderate size left effusion, status post left thoracentesis drainage of 1800 cc.
Laboratory analysis of his left effusion is pending.
2) Nonsmall cell lung cancer newly diagnosed, likely stage 4 as CT scan shows left adrenal fullness.
Hematology oncology and radiation oncology were consulted for possible palliative treatment.
Chest CT showed evidence of left adrenal fullness and superior vena cava syndrome with associated nonobstructing superior vena cava clot.
Heparin drip started for evidence of clot in the superior vena cava and possible clot in the right atrium on CT scan.
3) Coronary artery disease.
Patient with episode of 22 beats of ventricular tachycardia and multiple recurrent episodes of stable ventricular tachycardia.
He continued to have several episodes of stable ventricular tachycardia and his potassium and magnesium were repleted aggressively.
Electrocardiogram upon transfer here showed new Q waves in leads 1 and AVL and cycle troponins were decreasing here.
