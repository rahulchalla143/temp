History of Present Illness: This is a 23 year old female with no significant past medical history presenting with subacute GI process over past 3 months.
In [**2146-8-19**], she noted intermittent nausea and vomiting, about 2-3 times per week, usually worse in the morning, prior to eating.
About 1 month prior to admission, these symptoms have worsened in frequency and severity with daily nausea and vomiting associated with diarrhea up to 3-4 times / day.
She did admit to intermittent fevers and intermittent night sweats.
Given progressive lethargy, worsening nausea/vomiting and diarrhea, and confusion, she was brought to the hospital for evaluation.
INR was elevated to 1.5 and PTT was elevated at 41.2.
Outside hospital CAT scan of abdomen was reviewed which showed multiple liver masses suggestive for focal nodular hyperplasia versus hepatic adenoma, hemangioendothelioma, or fibrolamellar carcinoma.
Expansion of the right portal vein likely secondary to tumor thrombus was noted with thrombus seen in the proximal portal vein.
She was pain-free and nausea free, although mildly confused.

Expansile hyperechoic vascularized tumor thrombus is present within the proximal main portal vein extending into the right and left portal system with cavernous transformation noted in the portal hilum.
A portion of the left portal vein is not involved by tumor thrombus.
The presence of tumor thrombus is highly suggestive of an underlying malignancy with differential again including fibrolamellar HCC, conventional HCC, malignant hemangioendothelioma, or given GI symptoms atypical appearance of metastatic neuroendocrine tumor.
No suspicious lesions concerning for malignant disease in the chest.
Right lower lobe subpleural density, adjacent to an area of scarring, likely a granuloma.
[**2146-12-14**] MRI Head with and without contrast  [**2146-12-15**] CT Abdomen with contrast  Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 72714**] is a 23 year old female who presented after several months of nausea and vomitting, found to have subacute hepatic failure due to fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma with associated portal vein tumor thrombus.
CT and MRI were completed which did not show metastatic lesions and MRI did not show cerebral edema.
She received left lobe liver biopsy [**2146-12-16**] that showed severe macrosteatosis likely secondary to prolonged malnutrition.
She was started on a heparin drip [**2146-12-17**] to prevent tumor propagation.
Please refer to the operative note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for additional details.
Pertinents, by system:  Neuro: After receiving intermittent fentanyl and propofol in the ICU, she was on intermittent IV dilaudid in the initial days following the operation and subsequently transitioned to oral dilaudid which she tolerated well.
There was initial concern of oversedation and the patient voluntarily agreed to decrease dosing.
Her pain was well controlled at time of discharge on a regimen of oral dilaudid 2-4 mg Q4H prn pain which she was using approximately every six hours.
CV: Ms. [**Known lastname 72714**] was tachycardic initially post-operatively in the 130s.
She has initial difficulty with deep inspiration due to splinting from the abdominal pain and was noted to have decreased breath sounds at the bases on POD 6 into POD 7.
Her oxygen saturation dropped while working with physical therapy to the mid 80s and CXR confirmed mild to moderate bilateral atelectasis with associated pleural effusion.
Calorie count for POD 9 showed 700 calories intake and 11 gms of protein but this only counted her consumption of the hospital food service meals (not including the food brought in by her family, which was documented by the nurses and more than half of her daily intake).
She was discharged with detailed instructions for scheduled blood draws to manage her INR and coumadin dosing.
She had no additional issues or concerns of bleeding.
She was noted to be several liters positive and well above her dry weight in kilograms with equal bilateral lower extremity edema on physical examination.
Onc: Ms. [**Known lastname 72714**] had a bone scan on POD 9 as part of workup to assess for metastatic disease.
On POD 11, she was ambulating, tolerating regular diet and her pain was well controlled with PO pain medications.
Discharge Instructions: Please call Dr[**Name (NI) 1369**] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] for fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, increased abdominal size, increased abdominal pain, redness, increased drainage or bleeding at the incision site, yellowing of skin or eyes, confusion or lethargy.
Eat as well as possible and drink supplements such as ovaltine, carnation instant breakfast, milkshakes (you can add protein powder) Drink enough fluids to keep the urine light yellow in color Weigh yourself daily, if the weight changes by more than 3 pounds daily, or you are back to your pre-operative weight please call the office as the lasix dose may need to be decreased or stopped.
