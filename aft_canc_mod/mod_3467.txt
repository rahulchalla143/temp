He denies any urinary symptoms, shortness of breath or edema, but does endorse decreased appetite.
Denies any other localizing signs or symptoms of infection.
He does endorse sleeping more in the last 2-3 weeks and that he's been taking more pain medication to keep his pain at his baseline level.
At baseline he has pain in his right upper qaudrant and flank from his tumor progression.
There is also rib involement adjoining the tumor site.
His describes his pain as constant, pulsing in quality, worsening for last several weeks.
He rated his abdominal pain as [**4-13**].
A renal ultrasound demonstrated no obstruction or hydronephrosis.
He was given a total of 5L NS while in the ED with minimal Cr drop.
Now being admitted to OMED for continued management of acute renal failure.
Additionally c/o baseline dysphagia since emergency trach last [**Month (only) 116**].
Past Medical History: Renal Cell Carcinoma (please see below) - h/o RLE DVT [**8-/2107**] - Colonic perforation - Hyponatremia - Anemia - Cervical surgery with rod-placement due to C2 met  ONCOLOGIC HISTORY Mr. [**Known lastname 73639**] presented with hematuria and flank pain in [**1-/2107**] and was found to have a 5.1 x 5.8 cm R renal mass by CT scan and underwent partial R nephrectormy in 2/[**2106**].
In [**10/2107**], his renal cell carcinoma developed in the R subcostal region and was resected.
In [**2108-4-3**], he was found to have a soft tissue mass (2.5 x 3.2 cm replacing the C2 vertebral body) and underwent posterior cervical fusion form the occiput to C5 as well as left sided C2 laminectomy and decompression.
In [**2108-11-3**], he was enrolled in a phase II trial evaluating sorafenib and concurrent bevacizumab.
Last CT [**2109-1-3**] revealed decreased tumor size, but also colonic perforation which is currently encapsulated - not a surgical candidate until sorafenib & bevacizumab have cleared system given concern for poor wound healing.
Father diagnosed with prostate cancer in his 70s and is still living.

Interval increase in left nephrectomy bed fluid collection, including extravasated oral contrast, which has tumor seen at least along surrounding the inferior portions of this collection.
Right abdominal wall mass described above.
Diffusely fatty liver and distended gallbladder, as before.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
Small foci of ill-defined opacity within both lungs are likely inflammatory or infectious in nature.
Brief Hospital Course: 44 yo F metastatic renal cell cancer and known colonic perforation presenting five days after last admission with ARF and hyperkalemia.
#) Acute renal failure.
Confirmed poor po intake but denied any other new nephrotoxic drugs, dysuria or difficulty urinating when has urge.
Imaging revealed no evidence of hydronephrosis so unlikely to be post-renal etiology.
Other consideration would be progression of cancer but this seems unlikely to have occurred so quickly given no prior involvement of contralateral kidney.
Ultimately attributed to contrast nephropathy from CT obtained during the prior admission when he may have also been dehydrated.
Secondary to ARF and poor renal clearing.
#) Renal cell carcinoma/Colonic Perforation: S/p R kidney resection with diffuse metastases.
Most recently with colonic perforation on R flank.
From the day following admission had worsening abdominal pain despite dramatic increases in both fentanyl patch and dilaudid pca.
CT Abd/pelvis [**1-14**] with increased extravasation, as well as increased perinephric fluid at L kidney.
Now s/p ileostomy & pigtail placement with decreased pain.
CT Scan [**1-24**] to assess abscess with increased size of right middle lobe nodule from [**1-2**] and an increase in size of the right anterolateral abdominal wall metastasis since [**1-14**].
#) Leukocytosis - Newly noted [**1-11**] AM.
Denies any localizing symptoms/signs of infection beyond worsening R flank pain.
Does have known colonic perforation which is concerning for occult bacteremia.
Work-up for colonic perforation as above.
No localizing symptoms of infection, but does have known colonic perforation with abscess.
#) Pain - Only fairly well controlled on admission, stable on discharge.
As an outpatient had recently increased Fentanyl patch from 75mcg to 125mcg.
Started dilaudid pca for breakthrough.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with acute renal failure, infection surrounding your intestinal wall, and poor nutrition.
Upon admission, you were known to have a collection of fluid in your abdomen from your cancer communicating with your colon.
