Admission Date:  [**2181-3-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2181-3-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2119-7-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5119**] Chief Complaint: Rectal cancer admittted for elective laproscopic sigmoid colostomy.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Laproscopic sigmoid colostomy   History of Present Illness: 61 yo M with h/o CMML, nephrotic syndrome, penile squamous cell in situ, presents for semi-elective diverting loop iliostomy for newly diagnosed, partially obstructing rectal squamous cell carcinoma.
Pt was recently hospitalized for hypoxia and rectal pain.
He was diagnosed with RSV pneumonia and rectal mass was biopsied confirming a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the anus.
He also developed and was treated for C difficile colitis.
Past Medical History: 1) poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma of the anus, unable to obtain anal PAP 2) Chronic metamyelocitic leukemia - Diagnosed in [**2178**] and managed conservatively managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 2025**].
Possibly secondary to cyclophosphamide exposure in treatement of Nephrotic syndrome.
3) Nephrotic Syndrome with membranous nephropathy, bx proven per  report.
He was treated with Cytoxan and prednisone for approximatelyfive years, but has had no treatment for the past four to five years.
4) Hypertension 5) Diverticulosis 6) Colonic polypectomy 7) Status post right inguinal hernia 8) Vasectomy 9) Penile implant for erectile dysfunction 10) RSV pneumonia 11) C difficile colitis 12) Squamous cell carcinoma in situ on the skin of the penis completely excised on [**2176-5-15**], by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 2025**]; squamous cell carcinoma with focal superficial invasion of the skin of the penis completely excised on [**2180-9-22**], by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
No family history of hematological malignancies.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
Neck Supple, No LAD, No thyromegaly.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
No HSM EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
V/Q scan [**2181-2-17**]:  multiple subsegmental matched perfusion defects, no unmatched perfusion defects, indeterminant result .
6-mm iliac chain lymph node.
Bone marrow signal abnormality likely reflecting the patient's underlying leukemia.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 61 yo M with h/o CMML, nephrotic syndrome, penile squamous cell in situ, who presented for semi-elective diverting loop ileostomy for newly diagnosed, partially obstructing rectal squamous cell carcinoma whom required persistent intubation for acidosis.
Such drop is more than to be expected due to simply chronic renal disease and acute respiratory acidosis due to vent settings.
Cause was likely multifactorial: 1) Renal insufficiency with baseline bicarb 18-20, non anion gap acidosis; 2) Bowel prep likely decreased bicarb to 15; 3) Increased dead space due to pulmonary disease (DLVA elevated, expired CO2 during surgery showed Dead/V 40%) causes "usual" settings to cause CO2 retaining.
No acute changes in expired CO2 thus do not expect operative PE as etiology of increased dead space; 4) Perioperative lactic acid elevation also contributed with tiny anion gap elevation.
Rectal Cancer The patient had a laparoscopic sigmoid colostomy.
The patient will follow up with his primary oncologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4223**] in [**Location (un) **] for radiation and chemotherapy.
The patient's pain was minimal during his hospitalization.
He did not have any evidence of high frequency ostomy output and did not have any fevers.
CMML:  The patient's hydroxyurea was held as it is know to have an effect on post op healing and infection risk.
# Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's' Cr remained at baseline (~3) due to membranous nephropathy.
Send results to patient's oncologist - Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4223**] Fax # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 80877**]   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital1 6136**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: -Rectal cancer s/p laproscopic sigmoid colostomy.
-Post-operative acidosis likely multifactoral in nature related to chronic renal insufficiency, bowel preparation, and underling lung disease.
Hydroxyurea can interfere with post-operative wound healing and infection.
-Return to ED if you experiecne worsening pain, nausea/vomiting, fefvers/chills, are unable to eat or have any other worrisome signs/symptoms.
-Replace fluid loss from ostomy daily.
You may be advised to take 4mg of Imodium, repeat 2mg with each episode of loose stool.
