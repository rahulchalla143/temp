On post-op day 2, the patient became hypotensive with MAP 55-60, had an increased oxygen requirement, and was tachycardic with heart rate 120-150s.
The patient was intubated without incident for his increased oxygen requirement and received blood transfusions for a Hct of 21.8.
His chest tube and neck drain had bloody drainage, but became more serous in the following day.
A chest x-ray obtained at that time showed bilateral pleural effusions.
An esophagoscopy showed pink and well perfused mucosa ruling out graft ischemia/necrosis as the cause for the patient's tachycardia and increased oxygen requirement.
The plan at this point was for conservative management.
On post-op day 4, a CT scan was obtained which showed a moderate to large sized right pleural effusion.
Interventional radiology was consulted to tap this effusion and they were able to tap 800cc of bloody drainage.
He also developed suicidal ideations and Psychiatry was consulted.
On [**1-17**], the patient spiked a fever of 101.7 and was found to have a klebsiella urinary tract infection and was treated with Ancef.
The patient also develop some erythema at his neck drain site.
A neck CT scan showed an abscess at the superficial margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.
Physical therapy was consulted to assist the patient with ambulation and he was able to ambulated without assistance.
Serial chest x-rays showed stable basilar atelectasis and consolidations with no evidence of increasing pleural effusion.
Nebulizer treatments were provided to the patient which helped with his oxygenation.
After the patient was extubated, he had had persistent coughing which worsened whenever he swallowed liquids.
There was concern for aspiration and a video swallow exam was obtained which indeed did show moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration of thin liquids when he swallowed with his head upright.
