HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung with diffuse metastases to the liver, pelvis, and brain (status post carboplatin and Taxol radiation therapy 'Arissa') who was found to have brain metastases (status post resection) in [**2175-2-14**] who had been recently started on Navelbine salvage who presented on [**2175-4-10**] with hypotension, mild disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute renal failure, and supraventricular tachycardia.
The patient's hypotension resolved overnight and was thought largely secondary to volume depletion and possibly sepsis.
On [**4-12**], she developed agitation and further confusion; requiring Haldol.
The patient was noted to develop stridor and tachycardia.
times two and Cogentin 2 mg times two for suspected laryngeal dystonia from Haldol.
The patient was given Pepcid 20 mg intravenously times one and dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously for a potential allergic reaction with no improvement.
The patient was unable to speak secondary to distress.
Ear/Nose/Throat was consulted and found no upper airway obstruction and normal cords.
The patient was found to have new lung nodules, liver metastases, and pelvis metastases in [**2174-5-16**].
Over the course of [**2174-9-16**] to [**2175-9-16**] the patient was found to have increasing liver function tests and noted to have worsening liver metastases.
In [**2175-1-14**], she was found to have brain metastases and underwent right frontal lobe resection with two smaller metastases remaining in [**2175-2-14**].
Reactive airway disease and emphysema.
Iron deficiency anemia.
Gastritis with Helicobacter pylori.
History of abnormal PAP smear.
History of whole body image.
History of axillary abscess.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Generally, the patient was an ill-appearing female in moderate respiratory distress.
Neck examination revealed no lymphadenopathy.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
The lungs were clear with the exception of decreased breath sounds up to halfway up the right lung field and one quarter of the way up the left lung field.
Extremity examination revealed no edema.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  On chest x-ray the patient had a large right pleural effusion with a question of left lower lobe atelectasis.
IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of poorly differentiated lung cancer with diffuse metastases to the liver, pelvis, and brain; status post carboplatin, Taxol, radiation therapy, Arissa, and metastases resection (on Navelbine salvage) who presented with hypotension, mild disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute renal failure, and lactic acidosis who now returned to the Feniard Intensive Care Unit with acute respiratory distress.
PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient with a question of acute stridor with an unchanged chest x-ray.
The differential diagnosis initially included a dystonic reaction from Haldol or an allergic reaction.
However, the patient did not respond to Cogentin, Benadryl, steroids, or H2 blockers; and Ear/Nose/Throat ruled out any upper airway swelling or laryngeal spasms.
Thus, it was thought that the patient had a fixed obstruction; perhaps some lymph nodes or lung cancer which became clinically evident as wheezing or stridor in the setting of increased mini-ventilation from progressive metabolic acidosis.
She was not any more responsive on [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure and required morphine for some sedation to enable her to work with the [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure.
NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient with mental status changes in the setting of diffusely metastatic breast cancer with liver involvement and hepatic encephalopathy as well as hypoxia and worsening acidosis with hypercarbia.
GASTROENTEROLOGY ISSUES:  The patient with rapidly progressive liver failure; likely secondary to metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with diffuse involvement.
Progressive metabolic lactic acidosis was likely secondary to hepatic failure.
HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY ISSUES:  The patient with metastatic lung cancer diffusely spread to liver, [**Hospital1 500**], and brain.
The patient had ongoing evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation.
CODE ISSUES:  The patient presented with progressive lung cancer diffusely metastatic which was refractory to multiple chemotherapeutic regimens, brain metastases resection, and radiation therapy.
She developed worsening respiratory failure in the setting of progressive lactic acidosis, pleural effusions, respiratory acidosis, and altered mental status.
Progressive metabolic lactic acidosis.
Right pleural effusion.
Acute renal failure.
Disseminated intravascular coagulation.
Supraventricular tachycardia.
