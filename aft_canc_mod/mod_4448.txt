There was no evidence of contrast extravasation on the arteriograms; however, prophylactic coiling of the GDA was performed.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 30113**] was admitted on [**2174-7-31**] for treatment of his GI bleed.
GI was reconsulted since they had clipped the gastrojejunostomy bleeding previously, but their recommendation was for serial Hct and IR embolization if bleeding persists because of failure of endoscopic hemostasis.
Hct was stable until HD3, when it fell from 29.9 to 26.1, with continued bleeding noted in ostomy bag.
With start of clears on HD4, patient's ostomy output increased appropriately.
However, quality of fluid changed from thin to thick blood with clots.
Patient's blood pressure remained stable in low 100s, however mild tachycardia was noted to max of 105.
Patient was hemodynamically stable and mentating without difficulty, but given rapidity of change in Hct and continued volume loss, patient was given 1L bolus of NS and transferred to the ICU where he was rapidly transfused 3U PRBC.
Ostomy output slowly changed from bloody stool to nonbloody stool by HD7.
When patient developed acute bleeding on HD4, as detailed above, he was made NPO again until Hct was stable.
On HD6, patient was started on regular diet, which he tolerated without nausea or vomiting.
O2 sats were monitored regularly with no oxygen requirement throughout stay.
Patient had adequate urine output throughout his stay.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
