Admission Date:  [**2194-9-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2194-9-22**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bactrim  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2610**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right thoracocentesis Right Pleurex Catheter placement   History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with Afib and recurrent malignancy-related right pleural effusion, awaiting pleurex catheter placement, who was transferred from MICU s/p therapeutic R thoracentesis for dyspnea.
The patient's oncologic history is significant for CLL/SLL, metastatic prostate cancer, and a lesion consistent with renal cell carcinoma being followed by observation since [**2191**].
Over the past year he has had multiple admissions, most recently two weeks prior to admission, for recurrent right pleural effusion thought to be malignancy related.
He has had multiple therapeutic thoracenteses, and he is scheduled for an [**9-19**] Pleurex catheter placement.
CXR showed large R pleural effusion and new mild pulmonary edema.
He had persistent RR in 30's and was advanced to BIPAP for 4 hours beginning at 12 AM on [**9-18**].
In the morning he underwent therapeutic R thoracentesis that yielded 1200 cc of yellow fluid.
He currently reports 0/10 pain from his procedure and reports being thirsty.
Of note, the patient has a history of Afib and has been holding his coumadin for a scheduled outpatient pleurex catheter placement on [**2194-9-20**] and has an INR from [**9-18**] of 1.2.
The patient also reports recently developing increased nocturia, had developed lower leg edema over past year that has resolved with starting diuretics.
He sleeps on two pillows, and has some increased exertional dyspnea that he notices when walking.
In [**2178**], he was diagnosed with CLL/SLL and has intermittently received treatment with Leukeran since [**2185**].
In [**2180**], metastatic prostate cancer on Casodex since [**2176**].
Stage I adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon s/p complete resection of carcinoma in [**2187**], no recurrence since that time.
In [**1-/2192**], MRI for chronic kidney disease revealed a 9 mm nodule at the medial aspect of the left renal cyst consistent with a small renal cell carcinoma being followed by observation alone.
In [**6-/2194**], he was admitted after being found to have a right pleural effusion and was found to have anterior mediastinal retrocrural lymphadenopathy.
Given the potential risk of complications and the very likely diagnosis of lymphoma, a decision was made to not to perform a lymph node biopsy in the mediastinum.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: # CLL likely transformed to lymphoma # Small renal cell carcinoma, being observed # Metastatic prostate cancer as above # Hx stage I colon cancer - s/p L colectomy, no recurrence # Stage IV chronic kidney disease with baseline creatinine 2.5 # Hypertension # Reported history of congestive heart failure (no recent documentation of type or EF), records not available in our system # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, on chronic warfarin .
Squamous cell carcinoma removal.
Physical Exam: Physical Exam: Vitals:  99.3 132/70 89 22 91%/2.5L O2, 0/10 pain General:  NAD, speaking in full sentences, alert and oriented HEENT:  Normal conjunctiva, dry mucosa Neck: JVD Lungs: bibasilar crackles, no wheezes/rhonchi appreciated.
Increased respiratory discomfort with lowering of bed.
New mild pulmonary edema.
Persistent large right and small left pleural effusions, with compressive atelectasis, particularly on the right, and [**Month/Day/Year 1192**] cardiomegaly.
Osteoarthritic spurring is noted in the right shoulder.
The extent of the pre-existing right pleural effusion has substantially decreased.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
The extent of the left-sided pleural effusion has also minimally decreased.
Unchanged [**Month/Day/Year 1192**] cardiomegaly and minimal overhydration.

This was attributed to a combination of R malignant pleural effusion and pulmonary edema secondary to acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.
# CHF Similar to his prior hospitalization on [**9-4**], the patient presented with acute on chronic diastolic heart failure (ECHO on [**9-4**] demonstrated preserved systolic function).
On admission he presented with bilateral pulmonary edema, JVD, and orthopnea on exam; he had no lower extremity pitting edema.
The patient's home dose of sevelamer was continued without changes.
# Chronic issues: No changes were made to the patient's gout or hypothyroid medications.
