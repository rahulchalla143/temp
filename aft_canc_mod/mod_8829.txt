Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left craniotomy for metastatic breast cancer.
History of Present Illness:  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 64-year-old female who was diagnosed in [**2176**] with invasive ductal breast carcinoma.
The patient did rather well until she was diagnosed in [**2182**] with a recurrence of her disease to the hip, her back as well as the calvarium.
Intracranial MRI images revealed a progression of left vertex lytic mass with dura expansion compared to a previous scan from [**2188-4-15**].
There is a dural based metastasis is involving the left parietal convexity measuring several cm with mass effect on the adjacent gyrus of the left parietal lobe.
No significant vasogenic edema was identified previously.
The patient did have a significant positive history including CDH, which was treated with aspirin and Coumadin.
The patient has otherwise done relatively well with no significant headache,  nausea, vomiting, dizziness or seizures ever since.
The patient currently has no headaches or problems with the speech production or speech reception or cognition.
Propioception intact Toes downgoing bilaterally Gait is wide based with mild instability.
positive pronator drift on the right side with mild drift diadochokinesis.
ON DISCHARGE:   Pertinent Results: INDICATION: Breast cancer status post craniectomy for brain metastases.
There is a moderate pneumocephalus with small hemorrhage at the resection site.
There is no evidence for a marked mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
Large hypodense area within the right occipital lobe is unchanged from outside hospital reference CT dated [**2189-1-17**].
There is mucosal thickening of most of the visualized paranasal sinuses.
Anticipated post-surgical changes including pneumocephalus and mild hemorrhage at the operative site.
Right occipital encephalomalacia is suggestive of prior infarct.
ATTENDING NOTE: There is lucent area in the right parietal bone unchanged from outside CT suspicious for bony metastasis.
FINDINGS: There is an enhancing mass in the left parietal dural mass, which extends to the calvarium.
There is minimal, if any, mass effect on the posterior frontal and anterior parietal parenchyma.
No intraparenchymal metastatic lesions are identified.
Gliosis with evidence of laminar necrosis is again seen in the medial right occipital lobe, likely sequela of a chronic infarction.
Confluent low signal is seen in the deep and periventricular white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, unchanged since the previous study, which may represent sequela of whole brain radiation therapy, small vessel ischemic disease, or a combination of both.
There is fluid in the sphenoid sinuses.
Left parietal dural mass extending to the calvarium.
Chronic infarction with laminar necrosis in the right occipital lobe.
Signal abnormalities in the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, which may represent sequela of whole brain radiation therapy, chronic small vessel ischemic disease, or a combination of both.
Fluid in the sphenoid and right posterior ethmoid sinuses.
Opacification of right mastoid air cells.
Brief Hospital Course: This 54 y/o female with known PMH of breast cancer admitted after follow up imaging for restaging showed multiple brain metasteses.
Follow up head CT showed no hemorrhage.
