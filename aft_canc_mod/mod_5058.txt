History of Present Illness: 68yM s/p OLT [**2104**]  with ESRD on HD who presented to an OSH with a history of seizure.
Pt was taken to OSH where he was diagnosed with a pneumonia and transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further care given his history of liver transplant and recent GI bleed with admission to [**Hospital1 **].
Notes new productive cough over the last 3 days.
He had an EGD which identified a doudenal bulb ulcer which was clipped and injected.
He reports no blood per rectum or hematemesis.
Pt was noted to have a Hct of 17.8 on admission and due a history of recent GI bleed he was transferred to the ICU and give blood transfusions with an appropriate increase in his HCT to 30.0 which remained stable throughout his hospital course.
When he received this blood transfusion he began to have respiratory compromise and he was started on BiPAP in the ICU and he was dialysed and 3L offluid was removed.
This resolved his respiratory symptoms and he subsequently was able to oxygenate without supplemental oxygen.
His Hct remained stable and he had no evidece of bleeding from his GI tract and he was transferred out of the ICU.
He did have evidence of a possible continued pneumonia on a CXR and he was continued on IV antibiotics while in the hospital.
Because of previous findings on blood work indicating a possible myelodysplastic disorder of some type we discussed the possibility of a bone marrow biopsy.
