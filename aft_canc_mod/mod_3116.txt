Admission Date:  [**2102-12-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2103-1-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2041-6-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Cefepime / Meropenem / Voriconazole  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: Elective admission for chemotherapy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: central line placement endotracheal intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure   History of Present Illness: This is a 60-year-old female with PMHX significant for AML M6, erythroleukemia, diagnosed in [**2101-11-24**] who is currently admitted for re-induction chemotherapy.
Her hospital course was complicated by ARDS with MICU intubation believed to be secondary to an allergy to merepenum.
During that hospitalization she also developed an interstitial pneumonitis and coagulase negative bacteremia.
The patient did not undergo consolidation or bone marrow biopsy secondary to her complicated ICU course and her counts have been closely monitored since her discharge.
[**12-7**] the patient was found to have a recurrence of her leukemia.
Acute myelogenous leukemia, status post chemotherapy with Idarubicin and Cytarabine.
Adult respiratory distress syndrome secondary to an allergic reaction to Meropenem.
Neutropenic fever.
4.H/o adrenal insufficiency during MICU stay 5.
Hypoxic respiratory failure.
H/o R knee injury  Social History: She lives in [**Location 1468**].
Family History: Mother died from a CVA, and her brother had a heart attack at about 60 years of age.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion   Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo female w/ PMHx significant for AML s/p induction x1 complicated by MICU course now relapsed, admitted for re-induction.
AML - Pt had a TTE on admission that showed and EF of 75%.
The patient tolerated her chemotherapy well without major complications.
[**1-3**] the patient spiked a fever to 101.0 and was given a dose of vancomycin and gentamicin.
CXR showed no pneumonia.
[**1-4**] the patient spiked a fever to 103.4 and complained of a sore throat and cough.
Pt had a history of questionable antibiotic allergies that were not totally confirmed.
CXR showed new lateral LLL opacity, infiltrate vs. volume loss.
[**1-7**] the patient continued to spike fevers as high as 103.
[**1-8**] the patient spiked a fever to 105.0 with chills and diarrhea.
A CT scan of the chest was obtained that showed scarring from prior ARDS but no new pulmonary pathology.
She was also found to have low K+, low Mg, and low platelets.
[**1-8**] evening the patient became acutely SOB with an O2 sat of ~ 50%.
Her lungs had diffuse crackles and she was bringing up pink frothy sputum.
CXR at the time showed pulmonary edema c/w CHF.
[**1-10**] the patient was extubated without difficulty but continued to have fevers/rigors with an associated drop in O2 saturation.
It was thought that the patient could not tolerate the tachycardia associated with her fevers which sent her into CHF.
As a result the patient was placed on IV solumedrol for fever suppression.
[**1-9**] pt had a TTE that showed EF 45% w/ distal wall hypokinesis new from admission.
Per cardiology, decreased EF and elevated troponin possibly related to cardiotoxicity of mitoxantrone.
MI in LAD distribution also considered a possibility.
[**1-14**] & [**1-15**] pt found to have elevated transaminases thought to be [**12-27**] to voriconazole.
[**1-15**] pt was found to be hyperkalemic to 5.6, as a result, captopril was stopped.
All antibiotics were tapered once she reamined afebrile with temp<100.6 without complications.
ACS: developed acute pulmonary edema in setting of acute coronoary syndrome.
Repeat echo prior to discharge was of suboptimal quality, but showed restroration of original LVEF and no WMA.
The aberrant echo may have represented changes related to her MI however typically ischemia causes transient diastolic dysfunction that rapidly resolves with restoration of blood flow.
ACute myelogenous leukemia with relapse now s/p 5 day course mitoxantrone/etoposide 2.
Congestive heart failure - mixed diastolic/systolic failure in setting of ACS 5.
ACS   Discharge Condition: stable, afebrile  Discharge Instructions: Take your temp every day.
If >100.6, have trouble breathing, vomiting, increased diarrhea contact your physician or come back to the emergency room.
