Imaging/diagnostics: - CT chest wo contrast [**7-12**]: Linear opacity in the b/l lungs likely represents atelectasis, but underlying infection cannot be excluded.
Multiple lytic bone lesions involving multiple vertebral bodies/posterior elements, ribs, sternum could represent metastatic disease or multiple myeloma (new since CXR of [**2161-8-18**]).
Lytic lesions most severe at T3, T7 and T12 where there is destruction of the osseus vertebral body cortex and extension of soft tissue density into the spinal canal and collapse of T7 vertebral body.
MRI could be obtained for further evaluation if concern for cord involvement or compression.
Debris within proximal esophagus raises concern for aspiration risk.
MRI spine [**7-13**]: Diffuse bone marrow replacement throughout the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine consistent with widespread osseous malignancy, most likely metastatic disease.
Multilevel epidural soft tissue components with evidence of cord compression at the T3 vertebral body level without intrinsic cord signal abnormalities.
Loss of height of the T7 vertebral body with diffuse bone marrow infiltration, concerning for pathologic compression fracture.
Ventral epidural component narrowing the thecal sac and abutting the ventral spinal cord without evidence of cord compression.
Multilevel degenerative disc disease throughout the cervical and lumbar spine.
Skeletal survey [**7-13**]: SKELETAL SURVEY: There are multiple punched-out lytic lesions without a sclerotic rim in calvarium, the largest measuring at least 1.5 cm.
Multiple similar lytic lesions are seen in the right and left humeri and bilateral clavicles.
In the left humerus, there is a large lytic lesion in the mid diaphysis with endosteal scalloping with this lesion at risk for pathologic fracture.
There are no significant abnormalities of the visualized lung.
The ribs bilaterally have a mottled appearance suggestive of lytic lesions.
No discrete lesion is identified on the AP projection of the chest.
On the lateral projection of the thoracic spine, there is loss of vertebral body height and disc space narrowing seen at multiple levels of the mid thoracic spine which correlates with the lytic lesions and compression fracture deformities seen on prior CT and MRI.
No focal lytic lesions are seen in the pelvis or sacrum or proximal femurs.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CT lumbar spine wo contrast [**7-14**]: Multiple new lytic lesions within the lumbar spine and bony pelvis may represent metastatic disease versus multiple myeloma.
The largest lesion is in the T12 vertebral body, with disruption of the cortex and epidural extension of soft tissue density , with distortion of the left lateral and anterior portions of the thecal sac.
Pathology ([**7-19**]): T3 tumor, corpectomy (A-B): Plasma cell myeloma (see note).
T12 tumor, corpectomy (C-D): Plasma cell myeloma (see note).
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
MRI C, T, L spine ([**7-24**]): CERVICAL SPINE: FINDINGS: Compared to the prior study of [**2162-7-13**], no significant change is seen in the cervical spine.
Mild spinal stenosis at C4-5 level.
No cord compression or abnormal signal seen within the cord, although evaluation on the inversion recovery images is limited due to artifacts.
IMPRESSION: Degenerative changes in the cervical region without neoplastic cord compression.
Mild spinal stenosis at C4-5.
THORACIC SPINE: The thoracic spine evaluation is significantly limited due to metallic artifacts.
The artifacts limit the evaluation of the spinal canal, but at T3 level, there appears to be mild indentation on the posterolateral aspect of the spinal canal and indentation on the cord with mild narrowing at this level.
At T6 to T8 level, there is no fluid seen in the paraspinal region which could be related to surgery, but CT could help for better assessment given the metallic artifacts limit the evaluation.
There are bilateral pleural effusions identified.
LUMBAR SPINE: No evidence of high-grade spinal stenosis in the lumbar region.
Mild degenerative changes as before.
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis ([**7-26**]): Large bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with bilateral consolidations.
Soft tissue thickening and induration posterior to the spinal rod placement.
This soft tissue is consistent with postoperative changes but a superimposed infection cannot be ruled out.
No focal hepatic lesions.
Gallbladder sludge, without son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of cholecystitis.
Right pleural effusion, as seen on same-day chest radiograph.
Within this limitation, no pulmonary embolism is seen within the main and lobar pulmonary arteries and the proximal segmentaal artereries in the lower lobes; upper lobe segmental pulmonary arteries cannot be assessed with the poor contrast opacification, nor can any subsegmental arteries.
Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidations, likely represent atelectasis and have not significantly changed since the prior study.
Innumerable osseous metastases involving the thoracic vertebrae with intraspinal extension, have not significantly changed since the prior study.
MR THORACIC SPINE W/O CONTRASTR ([**2162-8-22**]): Very limited (non-enhanced) examination, with no gross evidence of large thoracic spinal epidural phlegmon or abscess.
There are persistent moderate-sized pleural effusions with known extensive osseous metastatic disease, with a more fluidic appearance at the T6 through the T8-T9 level of the fibular strut graft.
While this may simply represent the known extensive osseous metastatic disease at this site, given its fluidic characteristics (by both MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]), an infectious component cannot be excluded.

HemeOnc was consulted, and made the diagnosis of multiple myeloma after bone marrow biopsy.
Complicated post-operative course, with SICU, MICU, and [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stays for hypotension requiring intermittent pressors, volume overload, and aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.
Her staples were removed and her incision appeared to be healing well with steristrips.
#Hypoxia: LLL opacity on CXR and new onset hypoxia to 87% on RA on admission.

Pt reported history of mild GERD.
Repeat CT chest showed mild esophageal dilation.
#Rash: New pinpoint pruritic erythematous rash.
No new medication.
Symptomatically managed w hydrocortisone cream prn, likely secondary to sedentary status and decreased hygiene [**1-19**] pain w movement.
She believes she has RA and h/o sarcoidosis (unsubstantiated by her md's).
After diagnosis of multiple myeloma was made, the pt was discontinued on her salsalate and other NSAIDs.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with complaints of chest and back pain, and difficulty breathing.
Your chest xray suggested a left lower lobe pneumonia and compression of your lung space due to restricted breathing.
The compression of your lungs is likely due to shallow breathing from your chest pain.
You also had fluid in your lungs, which were removed by the pulmonary doctors.
You did not have a pulmonary blood clot which was confirmed with dopplers which showed no blood clots in your legs and a lung scan that was negative as well.
Your chest pain was attributed to the bone lesions from the multiple myeloma.
We treated you with pain medications.
You had a spine stabilization surgery.
