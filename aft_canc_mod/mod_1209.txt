Admission Date:  [**2166-3-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-3-28**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxia/SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation  History of Present Illness: This is a 87 y/o who presents from nursing home with respiratory distress.
Patient brought from nursing home with about 20 minutes of respiratory distress with saturation into the 60% on RA.
Chest x ray suggest a R middle plobe pneumonia.
Per daughters report, he had been treated for pneumonia over the last 3 weeks.
Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 34163**] he was having fevers, chills or productive cough.
[**Name (NI) **] recent admission to the hospital 2 years ago to [**Hospital1 336**]   Past Medical History: Gait abnormality HTN Vascular dementia Prostate cancer s/p chemotherapy 25 years ago.
Neck: supple, no JVD Pulmonary: Lungs clear anteriorly bilaterally Cardiac: RRR, nl.
no hepatomegaly.
Extremities: no edema Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Increased interstitial marking consistent with mild pulmonary edema.
Right hilar mass with likely post-obstructive pneumonia/pneumonitis which can be further evaluated by chest CT. .
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to ventilator and sub-optimal echo windows.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
[**2166-3-26**] Lower extremity doppler IMPRESSION: No DVT in the lower extremities .
Large right hilar mass is without change.
Worsening bilateral interstitial pattern probably reflects interstitial edema, although a component of underlying lymphangitic tumor is also possible.
Worsening confluent opacities in the lower lungs may be due to a combination of edema and infection.
There is also persistent partial post- obstructive collapse of the right middle lobe.
New small bilateral pleural effusions have developed.
Worsening opacities adjacent to the right hilar mass indicative of post obstructive atelectasis and/or pneumonitis.
Worsening opacities in the right lung base secondary to worsening effusion/lymphangitic spread of tumor or atelectasis.
This can be slightly advanced forward by at least 2 cm   Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 87 y/o M with h/o HTN, dementia admitted with hypoxic repiratory failure and hypotension found to be flu positive  The patient was intially admitted with respiratory failure and intubated.
The patient also had a hilar mass, making post obstructive PNA likely.
The workup of this was deferred given the patients poor prognosis with this acute illness.
The patient was in acute renal failure, likely ATN secondary to hypotension and was put on CVVH.
Given the hilar mass, the patient was on respiratory precautions for concern of Tuberculosis.
is blood gasses showed increasing acidemia.
Dobutamine was started, with no improvement.
Family was informed of his worsening condition and poor prognosis.
