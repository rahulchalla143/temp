CC: fever/chills/cough  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intervential Pulmonology: debriedement and stenting of left bronchus   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 75909**] is a 57 year old man with recent diagnosis of lung cancer who presented to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] with fevers, chills, and non-productive cough.
He initially felt a cough the morning of admission, and over the course of the day felt worse and worse, eventually developing a fever (to 102F) and chills.
He had bronchoscopy on [**11-16**] that confirmed the tumor obstruction on the left and chest CT confirming mass and likely post-obstructive PNA.
Pt had MRI and PET CT at OSH for staging of his disease and will have stent placed [**11-17**] by interventional pulmonology.
Past Medical History: - Asthma/COPD - Recently diagnosed squamous cell lung CA; diagnosed with cough requiring ED visit; 18-lb weight loss; - Positive PPD exposure on INH (had BCG in [**Country 5881**])-negative smear for AFB on recent bronch - History of PE on Lovenox   Social History: Quit smoking 4 weeks ago, had 35 years x 2 ppd.
Family History: Father died of/with laryngeal cancer  Physical Exam: VITALS: T98.3F, BP 120/76 (on 0.03mcg/hr Levophed), HR 88, RR 21, Sat 96% 2LNC GENERAL: Thin-appearing, no acute distress HEENT: OP clear, EOMI, PERRL NECK: JVP flat CARD: RRR, normal S1/S2, no m/r/g RESP: Decreased breath sounds on left throughout, clear on right, no wheezes ABD: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, + bowel sounds EXT: No peripheral edema   Pertinent Results: CHEST CT: IMPRESSION: 1.
Large central left perihilar mass obstructing the left upper and lower lobe bronchi with resultant collapse of left lung.
Findings are consistent with a central lung cancer, likely squamous cell carcinoma.
Moderate left pleural effusion surrounding the atelectatic left lung.
Enlarged lower left paratracheal lymph nodes, highly suspicious for malignancy as well as additional non-enlarged upper left paratracheal nodes with similar degree of enhancement.
Non-enhancing right hilar lymph nodes could potentially also be metastatic.
Correlative PET imaging may be helpful if warranted clinically.
Poorly defined peripheral right lower lobe opacity is nonspecific, but may represent focal area of infection, inflammation, or infarction.
Neoplastic etiology (second primary neoplasm or atypical focus of metastatic disease) is less likely.
In their absence, short-term followup CT would be recommended _____ could also be helpful for assessing additional smaller peribronchiolar nodules in the right lower lobe.
Asymmetrical appearance of left supraglottic region, possibly due to asymmetric positioning and dependent secretions.
Pathology Left mainstem tumor, excision: -Fragments of invasive moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with necrosis arising in association with squamous cell carcinoma in-situ.
-Focus suspicious for lymphovascular invasion seen.

However, he developed a fever and SOB and hypotension (see below) and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management.
He also underwent thoracentesis to further eval for extent of metastatic spread (cytology pending on discharge).
# Hypotension Patient was transiently in the MICU for hypotension, treated w/ levophed and IVFs.
The source for hypotension was considered secondary to post-obstructive PNA (below), but may have also been related directly to cytokine release from tumor.
# Post-Obstructive Pneumonia Presented w/ increased SOB, cough, and fever.
Radiologically showed atelectasis and consolidation.
He continued to have fevers with negative blood cultures.
Fevers in retrospect may have been tumor - fever, however given his clinical state he was continued on PO antibiotics (clinda + cefpodoxime) on discharge for total of 7 days.
OSH bronchoscopy showed no AFBs.
#) History of PE Lovenox was held for his procedures.
The patient was staged further w/ transbronchial lymph node biopsy.
Thoracentesis was performed to evaluate for malignant cells.
He was treated w/ a total 10 day course for post-obstructive pneumonia.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: One (1)  Inhalation four times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Disp:*14 syringes* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Squamous cell cancer of the lung - Post-obstructive pneumonia (probable) s/p interventional pulmonology stenting Secondary: - tobacco abuse history - COPD - s.p pulmonary embolus   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with fever and low blood pressure.
You were found to have lung collapse of the left lung.
You were also given IV antibiotics for an infection of the lung.
If you experience any of the following call your doctor or return for evaluation: fevers, chills, shortness of breath, cough, dizzyness, abdominal pain, dark black stool, cough productive with blood, chest pain / pressure, bloody stools.
