Briefly, this is a 76-year-old female who has multiple medical problems as described above, including hypercholesterolemia, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and known lung cancer, that was recently discharged 2 days prior to [**Hospital1 57361**] Rehabilitation facility after a lengthy  hospital course in which she underwent an aortic valve replacement and an atrial septal defect closure.
She was taken after this point to the surgical intensive care unit for monitoring, however, had developed respiratory distress that required intubation.
However, her abdominal pain resolved, and she was able to resume her tube feeds per recommendation of the general surgery service.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypercholesterolemia, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, right iliac artery disease, lung cancer, malignant pericardial and pleural effusions, pacemaker in situ, left carotid endarterectomy, hysterectomy, pericardial window, tonsillectomy, mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, patent foramen ovale, and coronary artery disease.
Vancomycin was for a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus that was growing out of her sputum prior to her previous discharge.
Her tracheostomy is noted to be in place without drainage or erythema around the site.
There is no drainage or erythema around the sternal wound.
Without murmurs, rubs, or gallops at this time.
Her abdomen is noted to be slightly distended with slightly hypoactive bowel sounds.
Minimally tender throughout.
No signs of rebound or guarding at this time.
Distal pulses are 2+ with no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
This 75-year-old female recently discharged with an aortic valve replacement and atrial septal defect repair was brought back into the hospital for further evaluation of persistent intraperitoneal free air status post percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement on [**2117-9-1**], nine days prior to this at readmission.
The question at this point was whether there was an active leak from the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
A CAT scan was performed at this time that revealed no extravasation, though this did not satisfy our curiosity in regard to the possibility of anterior leak of the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
On hospital day #3 the patient began to feel better, with less abdominal pain and less distention at this time.
Patient continued to remain afebrile and to remain hemodynamically stable.
There were no sudden rises in the leukocyte count, as well.
There was retained contrast present in the colon, but there was, again, no sign of any sort of leak at this time.
The patient also had a study of the venous system in the left upper extremity that revealed thrombosis of the left subclavian vein.
ER[**Last Name (STitle) 57362**]ving any increasing pains, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, chest pain, redness or drainage about the wounds, or if there are any questions or concerns or signs of any events there untoward.
Patient to have International Normalized Ratio checked daily with goal of 2.0-2.5.
Status post atrial septal defect repair.
Status post stage 3 lung cancer treatment.
