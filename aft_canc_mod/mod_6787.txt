Elevation of the left hemidiaphragmatic contour and shift of the trachea to the left are again seen.
Increased gaseous distension of the colon, consistent with post-operative ileus.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy small/normal cavity size and preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Dilated aortic sinus.
[**2147-7-25**] Renal US: IMPRESSION: No evidence of tardus parvus waveforms bilaterally in the right or the left kidney.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Exam limited due to the patient's body habitus.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 32665**] was brought into the operating room by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2147-7-24**] where he underwent left thoracotomy/left pneumonectomy, and buttressing of the bronchial stump with intercostal muscle.
He was hypotensive requiring multiple albumin boluses and IV fluids, along with neosynephrine POD 1.
POD 1 he developed acute kidney injury.
Renal US was a poor study due to body habitus but did not show abnormality.
On POD 2 he was volume overloaded and lasix gtt was started which he responded to.
POD 3 he developed afib which quiesced after diltiazem gtt.
POD 4 he was transfused 1 unit of PRBC's for low hct and to assist in oxygenation and blood pressure.
His diet was advanced but his abdomen was quite distended prompting KUB which was positive for ileus.
Suppositories and stool softeners were continued and he had a bowel movements without nausea vomiting and less abd distention thereafter.
CXR's were serially watched without evidence of stump leak.
Pain was initially controlled with dilaudid and bupivicaine epidural, which was split postop for hypotension.
He titrated off epidural and PCA early on and tolerated po dilaudid for effective pain control along with tylenol.
