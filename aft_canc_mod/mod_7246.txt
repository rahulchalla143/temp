Bilateral lower lung opacities are likely atelectasis.
Subcutaneous air along the left lateral chest wall and axilla is attributed to the postop changes.
There is no pneumothorax.
Mild prominence of mediastinal contour is likely from low lung volumes.
[**2194-10-16**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Small left apical pneumothorax after chest tube removal.
