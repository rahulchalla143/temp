Active Diagnoses: .
#Pericardial Tamponade from Malignant Pericardial Effusion: Pt was in sinus tachycardia and was hypotensive to the 80's systolically when transferred out of the intensive care unit.
Her cardiac status was monitored with daily EKG's assessing for voltage changes as well as daily pulsus measurements using a doppler probe (she remained in the 5-6 range, >8 was our threshold for concern for recurrent tamponade).
Prior to discharge she had another echo which showed no definite change.
#Recurrent Bilateral Malignant Pleural Effusions: This patient had recurrent bilateral pleural effusions related to metastatic breast cancer.
She had a left pleurex placed in the ED as well as drainage of a large volume from her right side via a thoracentesis and began to desat with a wet cough productive of a small volume of frothy, blood-tinged sputum which raised concern for re-expansion pulmonary edema.
On return to OMED, she had exam and imaging finding consistent with significant re-accumulation of her pleural effusion on the right side and underwent R-sided pleurex placement.
She was drained to the point of pain, symptoms, or cough and this was performed either by nurses or by her husband who had become very skilled at handling the pleurex drain.
She remained persistently tachycardic in the 120's and frequently as high as the 140's (120's seems to be her baseline per [**Hospital 191**] clinic vitals).
This was thought to be secondary to a combination of SIADH in setting of metastatic cancer as well as hypovolemia.
Given K somewhat elevated, cortisol deficiency also on differential although AM cortisol was wnl's on two consecutive mornings.
She continued to be hyponatremic and hyperkalemic during her admission and was a difficult stick occasionally requiring arterial sticks to check labs.
The endocrine team from [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and recommended a battery of tests including anti-TPO, anti-TG, serum aldosterone, and plasma renin levesl as well as continued urine lytes monitoring.
Chronic Diagnoses: .
# Metastatic breast cancer: Stable.
Surgical course: The patient showed tamponade physiology on echo and was brought urgently to the operating room for a pericardial window with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**].
Overall she tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for observation and recovery.
Initial attempts to wean vent were met with tachycardia and tachypnea.
Transitional Issues: This patient had follow-up arranged with her oncologist, with interventional pulmonology, with cardiothoracic surgery, and with the endocrine team at [**Last Name (un) **].

Outpatient Lab Work Please check SMA-7 on [**2111-7-24**] and fax report to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: -Metastatic Breast Cancer -Recurrent Malignant Pleural Effusions Bilaterally -Recurrent malignant pericardial effusion -Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia -Hypothyroidism -Urinary tract infection   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation and treatment of shortness of breath.
You were found to have a dangerous level of fluid around your lungs as well as your heart.
You were also found to have mild electrolyte disturbances including low sodium and high potassium and were found to have hypothyroidism.
The team from [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted to help us identify the causes of your electrolyte changes and based on the testing they recommended we currently think you would benefit from taking a low dose thyroid medication called Levothyroxine.
You were diagnosed with a urinary tract infection; we starting you on ciprofloxacin for 7 days.
Also, if that friend feels comfortable doing so, she should try to draw blood from you at that time as well and have it sent off for a CHEM 7 or at the very least, a sodium level.
