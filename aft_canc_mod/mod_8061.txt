Admission Date:  [**2136-3-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-4-6**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: diltiazem / atorvastatin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9160**] Chief Complaint: Bradycardia, S/P Arrest  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 87 y/o female with a h/o systolic heart failure with an EF of 35-40%, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, MDS requiring monthly transfusions whose family called EMS initially due to lethargy and somnolence.
Last night at around 5pm her family noted that she was lethargic and sort of leaning to one side, but initially left her alone because they thought she was tired.
She lives with her grandson and has a full time nurse during the day, yesterday she was complaining of an upset stomach and having diarrhea.
Additionally, her family says that she has had poor po intake for the few days prior to admission.
At the OSH ER she was intubated due to significant pain associated with external pacing, she was then started on a versed gtt for sedation which caused her to become hypotensive so she was started on peripheral neo.
With the mildly elevated troponin she was briefly started on a nitro gtt, but after discussion with our ER physicians since she was on peripheral neo the nitro gtt was discontinued.
Cardiology was consulted who felt that she did not require treatment for an NSTEMI since her troponin was indeterminate at the OSH, they recommended adission to the MICU and they would see the patient in consultation.
Labs were notable for lactate of 6.9 that improved to 4.1, Cr of 2.3, INR of 2.0, HCT of 31.4, plt of 94, CXR showed her ETT in the proper position.

STUDIES  TTE [**2136-3-29**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Moderately depressed global left ventricular systolic function.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
EKG- [**2136-3-29**] Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response rate of 66 beats per minute.
Q-T interval prolongation.
Intraventricular conduction delay of left bundle-branch block type.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes in the lateral and high lateral leads.
Widened mediastinum is unchanged consistent with vascular engorgement.
Right apical pleuroparenchymal scarring is chronic.
Mild vascular congestion is stable.
Bibasilar opacities have increased consistent with increasing atelectasis.
If any, there is a small right pleural effusion.
KUB [**2136-3-30**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction.
No focal fluid collections are seen.
CXR [**2136-4-2**] IMPRESSION: Interval worsening of the left lower lobe consolidation is consistent with infection/inflammation likely secondary to aspiration.
Interval resolution of right basilar consolidation suggests atelectatic etiology.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 87 year old F with a h/o cardiomyopathy, AF on coumadin, MDS requiring monthly transfusions who was found lethargic and bradycardic at home, had PEA arrest followed by bradycardia requiring transcutaneous pacing and intubation and transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU.
ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM: # PEA Arrest: prior to arrest she was bradycardic to the 30's, received only 2 minutes of CPR and 1mg of epinephrine with ROSC with bradycardic rate, requiring transcutaneous pacing.
Her bradycardia was likely due to beta blocker toxicity in the setting of acute renal failure and metabolic acidosis.
As her renal failure and acidemia improved, her heart rate normalized and on arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER she no longer required external pacing.
Electrophysiology consult was obtained on arrival in the ICU, who agreed that this was likely beta blocker toxicity, and recommended holding all nodal agents and observing.
They felt there was no indication for pacemaker placement.
She tolerated this medication well throughout her stay with no further bradycardic events on telemetry.
Because her blood pressures were slightly low (90's systolic on [**4-5**]) prior to discharge, the metoprolol is being held again.
# Hospital acquired pneumonia: patient was initially intubated due to her inability to tolerate external pacing, and at that time, CXR was clear with no evidence of pneumonia.
She then spiked a fever on [**4-2**] and CXR demonstrated new LLL infiltrate consistent with pneumonia.
As mentioned above, her bisoprolol was stopped on admission due to toxicity and bradycardia in the setting of renal failure.
Enalapril also held due to hypotension.
After being given many liters of fluid resuscitation for her hypotension, she did have some acute on chronc CHF decompensation, which signs of volume overload on exam and hypoxia.
# Hypotension: Patient noted to have asyptomatic hypotension with SBP's high 80's to low 90's on [**4-5**].
No evidence of infection.
# Acute kidney injury: Cr up to 2.3 on admission from baseline of 0.8-1.0.
# Atrial Fibrillation: on coumadin for anticoagulation and bisoprolol for rate control on admission, however both were held initially on admission given elevated INR and bradycardia.
# RUE edema: Patient was noted to have swelling of her right arm with noticible overlying ecchymosis.
A US was done which showed no evidence of DVT or underlying fluid collection.
# Toe pain:  complained of bilateral pain at 1st MTP joints, found to have redness and swelling concerning for pseudogout flare (has history of pseudogout).
# Dyspepsia: Patient with dyspepsia on [**4-5**].
Ruled out for MI, EKG with no changes.
CHRONIC, INACTIVE ISSUES: # Myelodysplastic syndrome:  platelet count remained low but stable in the 90K range throughout her hospital stay, however her hematocrit trended down, finally to 29.5 on the day of discharge, requiring a PRBC transfusion.
