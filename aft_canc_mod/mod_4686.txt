Noted nasal congestion and drainage with sore throat.
Denies Denies any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation.
Denies any abdominal pain or cramping.
Denies any shortness of breath, chest pain, chills or night sweats, lightheadedness, or rashes.
She then had developed some daily fevers and felt more fatigued and then ultimately had a syncopal episode.
Her blast expressed HLA-DR, CD33, CD117, CD11c subset M.  In terms of her presenting cytogenetics, she did not have any abnormal cytogenetics and she was with FLT3 and NPM negative.
On her day 14 marrow, which was done on [**6-9**] unfortunately, it revealed a hypocellular marrow with increased blasts, some left-shifted myelopoiesis.
Her treatment course was complicated by fever and no clear source was identified.
There was question as to whether it was related to her chemotherapy.
Had a bone marrow bx and aspirate on [**7-14**] which did not reveal any morphologic or cytogenetic evidence of disease.
[**2118-7-25**]: Cycle #1 high-dose ARA-C, complicated by fever, most likely due to ARA-C as had similar symptoms during induction.
[**2118-8-10**] to [**2118-8-19**]: Hospitalized for neutropenic fever and typhlitis.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Reveals an admission to [**Hospital1 2025**] around [**2110**] which by her report was for 2 days for low blood counts, admission to [**Hospital **] Hospital for gastroenteritis.

Normal appearance of the lung parenchyma, no pleural effusions.
No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.
No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
If the patient's symptoms persist, followup imaging should be considered.
No acute bony abnormality.
In addition, there is a relatively ill-defined bilateral pattern of parenchymal opacities with air bronchograms and minimal bronchial cuffing.
Given the patient's clinical presentation, this change would be consistent with pneumonia.
Otherwise, there is no relevant change.
No evidence of pleural effusions.
Multifocal lung consolidations and small nodular opacities rapidly appearing over few days and given the clinical history is concerning for lung infection, likely bacterial.
Fungal infection though less likely, cannot be ruled out.
Alternatively, recent leukocytosis in immune challenged patient as reflected from online medical records, may cause similar appearance.
Mild pulmonary artery hypertension.
There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40%).
Systolic function of apical segments is relatively preserved.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with mild-moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis and mild right ventricular free wall hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, etc.

# Febrile neutropenia- pt s/p 4 cycles HiDAC consolidation, presented at 18 days from last cycle.
P/w cough, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, fatigue, and fever of 100.5 suggestive of viral infection.
CT chest showed bilateral extensive opacities, concerning for multifocal bacterial pneumonia, less likely fungal infection.
Negative mycoplasma PCR and coccidiomycosis.
Pt remained afebrile with non-neutropenic counts throughout the rest of the hospital stay.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure- Patient developed respiratory distress in the setting of fevers.
CT chest showed extensive bilateral opacities concerning for multifocal bacterial pneumonia, viral infection vs fluid overload with multiple transfusions.
CXR began to clear after diuresis with lasix and auto-diuresis, and patient was extubated without complications.
Testing for fungal wall elements, histo, legionella, CMV, crypto, coccidio, and mycoplasma negative.
[**Location (un) **] virus antibodies pending.
Pt also with elevated BNP, c/f heart failure.
# Cardiomyopathy- In the setting of respiratory failure responsive to diuresis, a repeat ECHO was obtained with showed biventricular and global hypokinesis (new compared to [**5-/2118**]) and EF 35-40%.
This is likely [**1-19**] recent chemotherapy as pt received daunorubicin, exacerbated in the setting of sepsis and increased demands on the heart.
Her first day out on the floor her SBPs were in the high 70s and pt required two 250cc boluses to maintain SBP in the 80s, likely combination of dehydration (decreased PO intake) in setting of decreased myocardial function.
Pt was started on low dose carvedilol, however she remained slighly hypotensive so this was switched to metoprolol.
#hypotension - on admission, pt had SBP from high 80s to 120s.
She reported some diarrhea, having just started her period, and decreased PO intake in this setting, all likely compounding the effects of underlying cardiomyopathy with decreased EF and contributing to hypotension.
Pt was monitored on telemetry without arrhythmia or other events, HR initially fluctuated between 60 and low 100s and then stabilized to remain in roughly the 80s range.
Carvedilol was switched to metoprolol for its decreased alpha blocking effects.
# AML/Pancytopenia - S/p 4 cycles of consolidation.
Supportive transfusion with threshold Hct<21, and plt<10.
# Transaminitis: Mild, likely due to chemo.
LFTs trended down as antibiotic and fungal coverage narrowed.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: Pt had TSH and AM cortisol sent for evaluation of hypotension.
Disp:*7 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: febrile neutropenia multifocal pneumonia Acute systolic heart failure  SECONDARY: hypotension acute myeloid leukemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted with a fever in the setting of very low white blood cell counts because of your recent chemotherapy.
Even so, you continued to have fevers and then developed low oxygen levels.
A CT scan of your chest showed a pneumonia located in multiple different areas, and because of that it became more and more difficult for you to breathe.
We started a medication called metoprolol which has been shown to be very helpful in situations of decreased heart function.
We think your low blood pressures were due to a combination of the heart function and being dehydrated.
