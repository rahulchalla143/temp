Admission Date:  [**2195-3-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2195-3-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2155-3-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: OTOLARYNGOLOGY  Allergies: Lanolin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4181**] Chief Complaint: Left Neck Mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**3-9**] Tracheostomy PICC line placement [**3-12**] PEG placement  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 39 yo female with no PMH, who initially presented to an outside ENT with left sided neck pain with minor swelling.
She was thought to have an abscess and was treated with a course of antibiotics.
However, her symptoms continued to worsen and she presented to [**Hospital **] hospital ED on [**2195-3-3**].
A CT scan was done showing a large abscess/mass causing deviation of the toungue and airway.
Postop she had worsening discomfort and bleeding from the site of the I&D.
Upon removal of the packing diffuse bleeding was noted throughout the wound site.
She was taken back to the OR for a hematoma evacuation on [**3-5**].
Past Medical History: None  Social History: non-contributory  Family History: Mother deceased from metastatic leiomyosarcoma of the lung  Physical Exam: 99.5   50   158  14  98% on AC 550 x 12, 40%, PEEP 5 Intubated and sedated JP right neck w/ serosang drainage.
FOM soft, oral cavity unremarkable Lungs clear bilaterally Regular rate, bradycardic to 50's abd soft, non-tender  Pertinent Results: [**3-7**] CT Neck: CT NECK WITH IV CONTRAST: A large, heterogeneously enhancing submandibular mass is identified which measures roughly 8.7 x 7.1 cm in greatest axial dimensions.
There is also evidence of a surgical defect overlying the inferior portion of the mass, with air and a drain, likely related to recent biopsy.
There is significant mass effect upon the airway and oropharynx with shift of the digastric muscles to the right and narrowing of the airway.
Enlarged posterior cervical chain nodes are also identified, the largest measuring 1.3 x 1.5 cm (series 2, image 19).
The rest of the posterior cervical chain lymph nodes identified are not pathologically enlarged.
Note is made of a prominent thyroid gland, with a nodule extending superiorly with internal calcifications.
The carotid arteries and jugular veins appear patent.
No osseous erosions or abnormalities are seen.
IMPRESSION: Large heterogeneously enhancing submandibular region mass which has undergone surgical biopsy with drain placement.
A normal submandibular gland is not identified and primary submandibular gland tumors including adenoid cystic, mucoepidermoid or adenocarcinoma should be considered.
Enlarged left-sided posterior cervical chain and bilateral jugular digastric nodes identified.
[**3-9**] FNA cytology: FNA, Submandibular (C07-[**Numeric Identifier 20629**]):  POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS consistent with non-small cell carcinoma.
Site of origin may involve local spread from a nasophaygeal or thyroid carcinoma, or metastasis (i.e.
Left submandibular, tissue biopsy (S07-4674; [**2195-3-3**]):  Atypical epithelial cells, suspicious for adenocarcinoma (see note).
Much less likely is residual salivary gland tissue in the region of an abscess.
[**3-12**] CT TORSO: CT OF THE CHEST: There is a large incompletely visualized heterogenous poorly marginated mass in the left neck extending into the supraclavicular region.
There is extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the neck, extending into the superior mediastinum, as well as soft tissue stranding in these regions.
The lungs demonstrate a 3-mm non-calcified nodule in the right middle lobe (3:27).
No other nodules or masses are seen.
There is no pleural effusion.
Several small nodes in the axillary regions do not meet criteria for pathologic enlargement.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: The liver, gallbladder, adrenal glands, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and loops of bowel appear normal.
There is a large amount of stool within the rectum and distal colon.
No pathologic mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is identified.
Incidental note is made of a retroaortic left renal vein.
There is no ascites.
There is a 2-mm hypodensity in the right kidney which is too small to characterize.
There is no pathologic pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy, and there are no pelvic side wall masses.
There is no free fluid in the pelvis.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen.
Large incompletely imaged left neck mass, which is better evaluated on the recent CT of the neck.
No regions concerning for primary site or metastasis in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.
Extensive cutaneous emphysema in the neck, tracking down into the superior mediastinum as well as soft tissue stranding, likely post-procedural after tracheostomy.
3-mm right middle lobe pulmonary nodule.
[**3-13**] US THYROID: unable to visualize thyroid secondary to mass, tracheostomy hardware and subcutaneous air.
She was maintained on a propofol drip and morphine iv for significant pain in her neck.
On HD#3 she underwent an FNA of the neck mass followed by a tracheostomy with the thoracic surgery team.
She did have some difficulty clearing her secretions requiring mucomyst and frequent suctioning.
The cytology from the aspirate was felt by the pathologists to be consistent with non-small cell carcinoma, staining positive for cytokeratin.
The pathology from the biopsy at the outside hospital was also reviewed and was felt to show atypical epithelial cells consistent with adenocarcinoma embedded in an inflamed, reactive fibrotic stroma.
In discussion with the ID team, since the mass was no longer felt to be an abscess and the cultures from the outside hospital had no growth, her antibiotics were stopped on HD#5 and she remained afebrile for the remainder of her hospital course.
A CT of her chest and abdomen was done to assess for sites of metastases or for a primary malignancy for the remote possibility that the neck mass itself was a metastasis.
The scan found no other malignancies and was significant only for a small, 3mm RML pulmonary nodule.
A thyroid ultrasound was attempted to evaluate a thyroid nodule noted on the CT of her neck for possible malignancy.
However, the thyroid gland could not be visualized secondary to the neck mass, the tracheostomy hardware, and subcutaneous emphysema from the recent procedure.
In further discussion with radiology, it was felt that the nodule was likely a benign process and not related to the neck mass.
Once she reached goal tube feeds however she began having persistent nausea with a few episodes of emesis.
Because of the need for long term nutritional support and discomfort from the NGT, general surgery was consulted for PEG placement.
She was tolerating goal tube feeds through the PEG tube with minimal residuals.
As the patient had no signs of an infection we felt that this could be followed at rehab.
