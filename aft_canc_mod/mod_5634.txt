Past Medical History: Cholangiocarcinoma - Ms. [**Known lastname 4587**] admitted on [**2159-11-19**] to [**2159-11-23**] when she presented to the emergency room with abdominal pain.
While in the hospital, she underwent an abdominal ultrasound, which showed increase in size of the common bile duct, suspicious for an obstructive process.
- ERCP was performed on [**2159-11-20**] with brushings of the common bile duct which were positive for malignant cells consistent with adenocarcinoma.
She underwent abdominal MRI on [**2159-11-22**], which showed a segment VIII hepatic lesion which was compatible with cholangiocarcinoma.
The lesion is approximately 2.0 x 1.5 cm in size.
- She was evaluated for surgical resection and was deemed a surgical candidate if she could remain abstinent from alcohol consumption given the high risk of complications with liver resection in patients who are actively abusing alcohol.
She has been unable to remain sober for any significant duration since that evaluation, and continues to abuse EtOH chronically.
- She recieved her first cycle of gemcitabine and cisplatin [**2160-4-18**] PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: EtOH abuse with h/o withdrawal seizures Cirrhosis, due to HCV (genotype 1b), HBV, EtOH Cocaine abuse Chronic abdominal pain Gastritis Alcoholic pancreatitis [**5-/2156**] Cholelithiasis Diverticulosis Seizure disorder C5 radiculopathy - EMG [**2157-4-29**] showed mild chronic reinnervation in the biceps and deltoid Thoracic radiculopathy Anterolisthesis of L4 on L5, grade 1 Hypertension Asthma Polyclonal gammopathy Thrombocytopenia Depression Glaucoma  Social History: Lives with boyfriend in [**Name (NI) 5503**], commonly stays in [**Location (un) 86**] with her daughter.
Longstanding chronic EtOH abuse history - initially reports she hasn't consumed EtOH since her cancer diagnosis, but then admits to drinking "an occasional wine."
Family History: Mother had pancreatic cancer.

IMAGING [**2160-6-6**] CT ABD & PELVIS W & W/O CONTRAST, CT CHEST W/CONTRAST: Overall progression of disease with new diffuse tumor infiltration in the right hepatic lobe with metastatic foci in the left hepatic lobe.
New retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement.
New bony metastases.
Mild intrahepatic bile duct dilation has increased.
Moderate ascites.
New occlusion of the right anterior and right posterior portal veins.
Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
[**2160-6-9**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia.
Poor R wave progression.
Consider prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
[**2160-6-9**] BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either right or left lower extremity  [**2160-6-9**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY:  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Alveolitis, pulmonary edema or pulmonary hemorrhage significantly progressed since [**2160-6-6**].
Moderate, posterior layeriing, nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion is smaller since [**2160-6-6**].
[**2160-6-9**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: No CT evidence for acute intracranial hemorrhage.
[**2160-6-10**] TEE: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (LVEF>75%)..
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
IMPRESSION: No thrombus or spontaneous echo contrast in the LA/LAA/RA/RAA.
Hyperdynamic biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic atheroma.
[**2160-6-11**] EEG: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of severe diffuse encephalopathy.
This may be medically induced although it can also occur as a result of an anoxic event.
There did appear to be epileptiform features in the left central region initially but then became bilateral and synchronous in both central regions.
As the tracing progressed, the encephalopathic features appeared more prominently in that there was greater suppression of electrical activity and longer suppressive bursts.
[**2160-6-14**] LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US: No evidence for biliary obstruction or main portal vein thrombosis.
Heterogeneous liver and perihepatic nodal masses consistent with known cholangiocarcinoma.
Gallbladder wall edema may relate to underlying liver disease/ascites.
[**2160-6-15**] EEG: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study which shows a generally attenuated background with frequent generalized periodic epileptiform discharges indicative of severe encephalopathy with generalized epileptogenic potential.
At times these generalized periodic discharges appeared to be higher amplitude and more frequent over the left central region.
They did not evolve to form electrographic seizures and did not appear to have an obvious clinical correlate on video.
Compared to the prior day's recording, there was no significant change.
Worsening bilateral alveolar opacities likely reflect diffuse pulmonary edema; differential diagnosis includes widespread pneumonia and pulmonary hemorrhage.
Increasing large right and moderate left pleural effusions.
CYTOLOGY [**2160-6-7**] PLEURAL FLUID: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Mesothelial cells, macrophages and lymphocytes.
Rare atypical cells are present.
Alveolar macrophages and numerous neutrophils.
Alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and bronchial cells.
[**2160-6-13**] SPINAL FLUID: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 4587**] was a 58 year old female with cholangiocarcinoma, Hep B/C/EtOH cirrhosis, and alcohol abuse who presented from clinic with shortness of breath after a routine CT showed new right-sided pleural effusion and pulmonary infiltrates.
She underwent a thoracentesis that removed transudative fluid, but due to increasing respiratory distress, she was sent to the MICU.
During her MICU course, she initially tolerated and remained stable on BiPAP, but then demonstrated progressive clinical deterioration in respiratory status, hypoxemia and required intubation and mechanical ventilation.
CT scan showed multifocal pneumonia.
BAL was performed, without evidence for hemorrhage and negative for microbials pathogens.
She also developed afib with RVR and was cardioverted successfully, but was continued on a heparin drip for anticoagulation, slated to continue for 1 month after cardioversion.
She developed altered mental status, decreased level of consciousness despite lactulose and rifaximin for possible hepatic encephalopathy.
A 20min EEG was performed which showed epileptiform activity.
Overall, she demonstrated continued clinical decline, with persistent respiratory failure, progressive hypotension requiring vasopressor support, oliguric renal failure, and persistent coma (despite discontinuation of sedatives for seveeral days).
Several extensive family meetins, updating medical status and poor prognosis.
