She was brought to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital [**2154-12-19**] for intermittent hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension due to tracheal obstruction by trach tube with positional changes.
At that time she was volume overloaded and diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia.
Hospital course then was complicated by hypotension after attept to increase diltiazem dose from 15 to 30mg, and recurrent trach obstruction requiring repeat bronchoscopy.
She was diuresed for volume overload as well.
She was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] today after oxygen desaturations with positional change and inability to bag.
She received doses of vancomycin and cefepime in the ED for pneumonia given h/o MRSA and pseudomonas.

Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions.
Progression of scores of thyroid metastases to the lungs.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Moderate calcification in the aortic valve is of unknown hemodynamic significance.
Chronic right lower lobe and partial left lower lobe collapse.
PLEURAL FLUID [**2155-1-30**] WBC 283; RBC 150; Polys 8; Lymphs 38 Glucose 94; LDH 146; Albumin 2.1 pH 7.50 Negative for malignant cells .
There is mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Multiple diffuse pulmonary nodules are present throughout both lungs with a dominant mass in the right hilum.
Moderate sized pleural effusions are present bilaterally.
A superimposed acute parenchymal process, likely pulmonary edema, shows some interval improvement since [**2-1**], [**2154**].
LUE DOPPLER [**2155-2-6**] Nonocclusive thrombus extending from basilic vein proximal to PICC, extending to the proximal subclavian vein.

85 yo female with h/o mets, thyroid cancer s/p tracheostomy c/b tracheomalacia, with recent treatment for pneumonia and CHF, transferred here with hypoxia.
# Hypoxia -  At rehab, the patient had oxygen desaturations that occurred with position changes due to tracheomalacia and collapse around the trach.
CT chest was significant for pulmonary edema/collapse of RLL (chronic) and LLL.
CXR w/ consolidation at LLL.
Bronch/BAL on [**2155-1-27**] noted thick secretions and severe tracheomalacia.
BAL grew pseudomonas and serratia, pan-sensitive, specifically sensitive to meropenem.
The patient was initially also on vancomycin, but this was discontinued as there was no evidence of gram + infection.
Gram stain and culture of pleural fluid were negative.
Lasix was restarted at a low dose on [**2-3**] and then increased to her home dose to try to improve fluid status and respiratory status.
# UTI - The patient was diagnosed with a pseudomonas UTI, sensitive to Meropenem which was started [**2155-1-29**] and is planned for 14 day course.
# LEFT UPPER EXT DVT: The patient was found to have asymmetric left upper extremity swelling.
An ultrasound was done showing an almost occlusive thrombus in the left basilic vein.
Stools were guaiac faintly positive, but brown, thought to be secondary to her inflammatory bowel disease.
# Afib - Rate controlled on diltiazem and digoxin.
# CHF - EF 55%, mild AS on TTE here; likely volume down on admission, so boluses of IV fluid were given for poor urine output initially.
# AS - h/o ?critical AS at OSH, but TTE here shows only mild AS.
# Anemia - Hct trended down from 31->25.
# HTN - Continued diltiazem.
# h/o DVT - [**Location (un) 260**] filter in place.
# Sacral pressure wound -  stage I ulcer.
# UC - continued mesalamine .
# Hypothyroid - continued levothyroxine .
# Access - left PICC .
# PPx -  PPI, coumadin, bowel regimen, elevate HOB, Peredex mouthcare .
# Communication - patient and her daughter .
# Dispo - stable for transfer to rehab.
