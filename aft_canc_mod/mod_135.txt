Admission Date:  [**2195-3-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2195-4-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2112-12-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea on exertion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2195-3-23**] Aortic Valve Replacement(25mm Mosaic Porcine Valve), Mitral Valve Replacement(29mm Mosaic Porcine Valve), Replacement of Ascending Aorta(26mm Gelweave) and Atrial Myxoma Removal   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 5784**] is an 81 year old male with known atrial fibrillation and atrial myxoma for approximately 9 years.
Serial echocardiograms have revealed worsening aortic insufficiency and mitral regurgitation.
He concomitantly has complained of progressive dyspnea on exertion, [**1-3**] pillow orthopnea and worsening cough.
A transesophogeal echocardiogram in [**2194-10-31**] confirmed 3+ AI, 3+MR, with a 3x3 centimeter right atrial mass.
In preperation for cardiac surgery, he also underwent chest CT scan which revealed a dilated ascending aorta.
Family History: Denies premature coronary disease(before age 55)  Physical Exam: Admission Vitals: BP 140/90, HR 90, RR 14, SAT  94% on room air General: well developed elderly male in no acute distress HEENT: oropharynx benign, voice hoarse Neck: supple, no JVD, transmitted murmurs over carotid regions Heart: irregular rate, normal s1s2, mixed diastolic and systolic murmurs Lungs: clear bilaterally Abdomen: soft, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds, mild hepatomegaly Ext: warm, 2+ edema, no varicosities Pulses: 2+ distally Neuro: nonfocal  Discharge Gen NAD Neuro A&Ox3, nonfocal exam Pulm decreased bases, otherwise clear CV RRR S1-S2.
No mass/thrombus in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]  [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the LAA.
No thrombus in the LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Mild symmetric LVH.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity.
AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus.
Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
Mildly dilated aortic arch.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Moderately dilated descending aorta Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
Moderate to severe (3+)AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.
Conclusions: Pre Bypass: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
Mild  spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
No thrombus  is seen in the left atrial appendage.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more  depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The aortic root is moderately dilated athe sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
The descending thoracic aorta is moderately dilated.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending  thoracic aorta.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a right atrial mass just above the svc inlet.
There is a small  pericardial effusion.
An Aortic bioprostesis is insitu.
No AI or AS, no perivalvular leaks.
A mitral bioprosthesis is insitu, no MR, no MS, no perivalvular leaks.
There is no longer a right atrial masss or pericardial effusion.
Right internal jugular vascular sheath has been removed with no pneumothorax.
Bibasilar atelectasis and small pleural effusions are again demonstrated.
IMPRESSION: Persistent bibasilar atelectasis and small pleural effusions.
On postoperative day two, he experienced oliguria with rise in creatinine.
He was started on Neosynephrine to maintain MAPs > 70 mmHg and renal perfusion.
Neosynephrine was gradually weaned without difficulty.
Despite remaining in a normal sinus rhythm(with first degree AV block)postoperatively, Warfarin anticoagulation was eventually resumed given his history of atrial fibrillation and myxoma resection.
