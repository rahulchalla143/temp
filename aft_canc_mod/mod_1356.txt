Diffuse colonic diverticulosis without associated stranding or wall thickening to suggest diverticulitis.
Enlarged irregular uterus with potential mass lesion versus adnexal lesion on the right versus pedunculated fibroid.
Recommend non-urgent pelvic ultrasound to exclude underlying mass lesion.
Calcified atherosclerotic plaque throughout the abdominal aorta and iliac branches without aneurysmal dilatation.
Colonoscopy ([**2129-1-25**]) Impression: Diverticulosis of the rectum, sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon and ascending colon Polyp in the transverse colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations: Routine post procedure orders.
