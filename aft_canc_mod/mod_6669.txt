She was noted to have febrile neutropenia and was treated with abx as well as GCSF.
Denies any neck stiffness, headache, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or dysuria.
She does have a cough with some clear sputum, but no worse than usual.
Physical exam revealed no clear source of infection or bleeding source.
CXR was negative for acute pathology and prior diagnosed lingular pneumonia has now resolved.
On arrival to the floor pt complains of some shortness of breath and wheeze which resolved with a nebulizer.
Pancreatic lymphoma - stage IV high grade large B cell lymphoma (dx [**8-/2101**]) -s/p 2 cycles r-chop 2.
Rheumatoid Arthritis 3.
Emphysema (> 50 pk/year history of tobacco) 4.
Hypertension 5.
Macular degeneration 6. s/p cataract surgery on her left eye 7.
No family history of hematologic cancers.
Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM: Vitals: T: 100.8 BP: 140/50 HR: 112 RR: 25 O2Sat: 99% on 4L GEN: Pale, tired, no acute distress HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, no epistaxis or rhinorrhea, MMM, OP Clear NECK: No JVD, carotid pulses brisk, no bruits, no cervical lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: RRR, no M/G/R, normal S1 S2, radial pulses +2 PULM: Lungs mild wheeze bilaterally, no crackles in bases ABD: Soft, NT, ND, +BS, no HSM, no masses EXT: No C/C/E, no palpable cords NEURO: alert, oriented to person, place, and time.
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
Moderate-to-severe emphysema, with superimposed smooth septal thickening and vague ground- glass opacities particularly in the upper lobes.
This is most consistent with hydrostatic edema, but could also be seen in entities such as infection (viral, PCP), hemorrhage, or hypersensitivity reaction.
Partially obstructing lesion in the left lower lobe bronchus is concerning for neoplasm, either endobronchial lymphoma or another neoplasm such as carcinoid.
Extensive secretions noted within the trachea and right main bronchus.
Stable to slightly decreased multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules.
Nonaggressive chondroid appearing lesion in the right proximal humerus.
Incompletely evaluated soft tissue mass in the upper abdomen, similar in appearance to the recent PET/CT study.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Multifocal air trapping.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 yo female with high grade lymphoma s/p day 11 after R-CHOP cycle 3 with fever at home as well as anemia noted on lab results.
Respiratory Distress: Patient was treated for COPD exacerbation on IV steroids and NEBS.
CT scan demonstrated ground glass opacities and LLL nodule.
Underwent bronchscopy [**12-2**], showing highly vascular LLL endobronchial lesion and thick secretions.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] [**12-6**] for rigid bronch by IP to investigate the LLL lesion (concern was primary lung cancer vs. lymphoma).
Endobronchial lesion was resected with cauterization, but not completely removed.
Pt sustained R-pneumothorax from barotrauma, prompting R-pigtail catheter and increased O2 requirement to [**Month/Year (2) 597**] in PACU.
On [**12-8**], she again required [**Name (NI) 597**] - unclear cause (?mucus plugging); chest CT was negative for PE but demonstrated worsening ground glass.
Fever: Patient with documented fever in ER.
Patient was afebrile throughout course of admission.
# COPD: Patient was treated for COPD exacerbation on IV steroids and NEBS.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: One (1)  Inhalation prn as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Disp:*4 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 511**] Home Health Services  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Carcinoid tumor Pancreatic lymphoma Secondary: Emphysema Rheumatoid Arthritis Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Good, on 2 L NC, ambulating with walker.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for fever and difficulty breathing.
You had three bronchoscopies which showed no infection but a carcinoid tumor.
They removed some of the tumor and currently you do not need further treatment.
You were admitted to the ICU following a bronchoscopy due to difficulty breathing, you had a chest tube placed becuase there was concern of a lung collapse.
A pulmonary embolism was ruled out.
Go to the ER if you experience fever, chills, difficulty breathing, nausea, diarrhea or other concerning symptoms.
