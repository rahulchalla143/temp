[**5-27**] CXR: no evidence of pna, effusions .
[**5-28**] US UE: Intraluminal thrombus of the right subclavian, axillary and brachial veins.
>15 colonies OF TWO COLONIAL MORPHOLOGIES.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
[**6-1**] and [**6-5**] Stool: negative for C Diff .
[**6-6**]: Central line catheter tip no growth .
Imaging: [**5-30**] KUB:  Distended air-filled colon with air-fluid levels.
The differential includes low colonic obstruction with a competent ileocecal valve or a functional dilated colon.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**6-7**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-5-30**], no change.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Allowing for differences in technique, the appearance of the lungs is not significantly changed.
There is no effusion or consolidation.
There were no immediate complications.
Infection: Ms [**Known lastname **] was febrile and neutropenic on admission.
At time of admission her U/A showed mod bacteria w/ [**3-13**] WBC; no leuk esterase or nitrites.
Her primary symptoms were frequent and large quantity diarrhea.
Subsequently her line tip culture from [**5-25**] grew MRSA, and pan-sensitive pseudomonas.
KUB revealed a dilated colon.
She remained afebrile off antibiotics, but did have a low-grade temp of 99.8.
One surveillence culture from [**6-5**] grew MRSA but surveillance cultures thereafter were negative.
TTE done and no valve vegetations seen on [**6-7**].
# R arm swelling: her right arm was significantly larger than her left on exam at time of transfer from ICU to BMT.
An US of the right arm showed a DVT in the brachial, axillary, and subclavian veins.
She was started on a heparin drip with no bolus, and subsequently transitioned to lovenox 1.5mg/kg QD for discharge.
Her platelet count had come up before discharge so she was no longer requiring transfusions.
She was discharged on lovenox for a 14 day course (concern of anti-coagulation with low platelet count).
# Diarrhea: Ms [**Known lastname **] had had several weeks of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea ascribed to B symtoms prior to her chemotherapy, which had been treated with reglan and lomotil.
On admission to BMT she was found to have a dilated colon on KUB.
Given concern for possible c difficile colitis, reglan and lomotil were discontinued, she was made NPO, and started on TPN.
She did well on this regimen, and her symptoms completely resolved.
Repeat KUB revealed improved resolution of her colonic dilation.
She was continued on supportive treatment for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea which have been long-standing issues for her - attributed to B symptoms of her lymphoma.
Given her dilated colon, her lomotil was discontinued, and she was made NPO with TPN as discussed above.
She was no longer requiring transfusions at time of discharge.
# CTCL: Ms [**Known lastname **] has a long history of CTCL (since the 80's).
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: febrile neutropenia lymphoma mycosis fungoides malnutrition   Discharge Condition: stable, normal white blood cell count, afebrile, eating and drinking, ambulating.
Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you have a temperature greater than 100.3 fahrenheit, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, inability to eat or drink, or any other health concern.
