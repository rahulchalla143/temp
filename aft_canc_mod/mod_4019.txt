Pt c/o cold symptoms x1 day.
Neck: No masses or LAD.
Neuro: Mental status: intubated and sedated  Cranial Nerves: I: Not tested II: Right pupil dilated and nonreactive.
Large right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with significant surrounding edema and mass effect.
There is leftward subfalcine herniation and mild uncal herniation.
Second hemorrhagic focus identified within the high right frontal lobe with minimal surrounding mass effect.
As there are two separate foci, this raises the possibility of underlying neoplastic process vs vascular malformation vs other etiology.
Post-surgical changes are seen in the surgical bed with hemorrhagic products and pneumocephalus.
[**2119-8-12**] Head MR: IMPRESSION: Hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe with postoperative change and acute intraaxial or hematoma in the right frontal convexity region.
These areas demonstrate no distinct enhancement, but small enhancing lesions are seen in the left temporal, occipital, and possibly in the cerebellar regions and these findings are suggestive of metastatic disease.
6 x 10 mm lobulated noncalcified right upper lobe nodule which is smoothly marginated.
Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
Gallbladder wall edema versus pericholecystic fluid.
Distended bladder with a tiny amount of air demonstrated.
Brief Hospital Course: 46F transferred from [**Hospital 2079**] Hospital after head CT showed a large right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhagewith significant surrounding edema, mass effect, leftward subfalcine herniation and mild uncal herniation.
Head MRI showed no evidence of herniation or brain infarct.
A chest/abd/pelvis CT was also performed on POD2 to screen for metastatic disease.
This showed a small noncalcified right upper lobe nodule, but no other stigmata of metastasis.
