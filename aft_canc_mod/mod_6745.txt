Briefly, this patient was admitted to an outside hospital initially with abdominal pain and concern for choleycystitis.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2108-12-31**] for [**Date Range **] as there was a presumed stone in the CBD, but no stone was seen.
This procedure was complicated by a very friable gallbladder and a persistent by duct leak.
He was transferred to the ICU on a ventilator given concern he would develop [**Doctor Last Name **]/ARDS after his severe aspiration event.

Persistent bile leak from the cystic duct stump with contrast directed away from the drainage catheter.
Necrotizing pancreatitis characterized by lack of enhancement of the pancreatic head, neck and proximal body with marked peripancreatic inflammatory stranding.
No evidence of hematoma in the abdomen or pelvis.
The previously described abnormality in Morison's pouch likely represented the surgical drain in this region.
Multifocal nodular opacities throughout the bilateral lung fields, near- complete consolidation of the bilateral lower lobes and small bilateral pleural effusions.
These findings are suspicious for an infectious etiology and given the bibasilar consolidation, aspiration pneumonia is suspected.
Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Interval worsening of diffuse patchy alveolar opacities throughout both lungs and persistent bibasilar consolidations concerning for pneumonia.
Aspiration pneumonia remains a diagnostic consideration.
CT evidence of necrotizing pancreatitis as previously described.
Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes likely reactive and related to ongoing inflammatory and/or infectious process.
Prominence of the left intrahepatic biliary ducts in the setting of a biliary stent, could represent obstruction, but unchanged.
Anasarca and increase in bilateral pleural effusions and small amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
[**2109-1-14**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
[**2109-1-25**] TTE: Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved biventricular regional and global systolic function.
FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 53 year-old male with a history of depression transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] with a persistent bile leak after laparoscopic choleycystectomy.
Current active issues are treatment for line-associated fungemia, c.difficile colitis and recurrent ileus.
The primary etiology of his initial respiratory failure was considered to be aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis after having frank bile in the lung on bronchoscopy.
Initially, the patient was kept on AC and low volume settings given the high perceived risk of developing ARDS.
On [**2109-1-19**] he was extubated and maintained good O2 saturations and showed no signs of hypercarbia thereafter.
2) Vasodilatory Shock: The patient was not hypotensive on his initial presentation to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] but over his first night in the unit developed severe hypotension with persistently low CVP's so that over his first two nights in the unit he required >15 L of NS and then LR in order to aim for a goal CVP of 15 and a MAP of >60.
This shock was considered likely to be septic/inflammatory and due to cholangitis +/- pancreatitis.
Surgery strongly recommended avoiding the pressors in the setting of known pancreatitis and these were never required except for briefly on the night of [**2109-1-15**] when he received norepinephrine briefly in order to get enough blood pressure to allow furosemide bolusing.
3)Choleycystitis/Cholangitis: The patient was febrile shortly after his arrival in the ICU and given his complicated procedure and the sequelae he was placed on pipercillin-tazobactam and vancomycin for cholangitis in this heavily instrumented patient.
5) Pancreatitis: CT scan on [**2109-1-10**] showed necrotizing pancreatitis.
Surgery was consulted and recommended NPO status, avoiding pressors, and supportive care.
The patient had a repeat scan on [**2109-1-14**] to rule out subdiaphragmatic abscess as he had persistent hiccups on the ventilator; this showed no interval change.
6) Ileus: The patient developed a functional ileus presumably due to his pancreatitis and inflammatory stunning of his bowel.
-Can remove NG tube when drainage significantly decreases and patient's nausea and vomiting improves.
7) Altered Mental Status: The patient was slow to wake up after sedation was stopped.
He remained persistently confused with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status but no focal findings consistent with ICU delirium.
Surveillance cultures to date had no growth.
10)  Clostridium difficile) The patient had a positive [**1-28**] stool cx for c.difficile.
