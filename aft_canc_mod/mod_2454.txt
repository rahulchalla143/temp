Presumably, these are related to the recent surgery and at least one of these represents a loculated collection in or adjacent to the mediastinum.
Extensive post-surgical changes are again seen in the right hemithorax.
She had some sinus bradycardia intraop therefore had cardiac enzymes cycled post op.
Her troponin were normal x 3 and she had no EKG changes.
She was seen by the Geriatric service as she had some confusion and dizziness prior to transfer.
They felt that her neuro exam was that of MCI (mild cognitive impairment) as opposed to Alzheimer's as she had no functional impairment and was not dependent.
The Aricept can cause orthostasis and would not be effective with MCI therefore was stopped.
She gradually improved and had no more confusion or dizziness.
Her chest xrays were followed daily and she underwent another bronchoscopy on [**2113-10-16**] and had secretions in both the right and left main stem which were aspirated.
From an ID standpoint she had some dysuria after the Foley catheter was removed and was started on Cipro.
She also had BAL's sent with each bronchoscopy and the antibiotic was changed to Levaquin for more gram positive coverage.
Her WBC has been as high as 27K and as low as 15K post op, currently 20K without any bands in her differential.
Her lungs are clearer and her wound is healing well.
She has no evidence of phlebitis or any skin problems and the elevated WBC is unclear as she clinically looks well.
