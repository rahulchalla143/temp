Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 56 year-old left-handed woman with right hand weakness and poor balance of one week.
In the few weeks prior to presentation, she had also felt mildly unsteady, tipping over when she walked.
One week before admission, she developed a severe headache.
The right hand weakness progressed over the following several days, prompting an ED visit on [**2144-5-31**].
At [**Hospital6 2561**] she was noted to have right arm weakness.
A non-contrast head CT showed left frontal mass.
MRI of the brain showed three ring enhancing lesions in the left frontal lobe without edema or midline shift.
She was subject to infrequent headaches for many years, without visual or neurologic aura.
She has had no fevers.
There has been no change in appetite or weight.
She has had no nausea.
She denies any prior history of transient weakness or visual loss, sensory loss or other symptoms to suggest attacks of demyelinating disease.
She has had no recent travel.
There have been no rashes, shortness of breath or chest pain.
MR-S demonstrated an area of elevated choline-creatinine ratio.
A lumbar puncture was negative for infection.
She underwent brain biopsy, although it was thought to be of high risk for further motor deficits.
She was found to have intermittent left bundle branch block.
TTE demonstrated an EF of 60% and trace TR and PI.
All three events were similar, starting with right hand shaking and progressing into seeing colorful lights.
She reports continued weakness at her right arm with no voluntary movement.
She reports not feeling well on [**2144-8-12**], when she felt warm, and her temperature was checked, but it was 99.5.

This was concerning for tumor growth, intracranial hemorrhage, or acute infection.
A CT head showed no intracranial hemorrhage; MRI showed small interval change in the size of her L frontoparietal mass which could be attributed either to tumor growth or post-XRT changes.
After the seizure an EKG showed sinus tachycardia to 95-110. .
Continuous EEG revealed >25 subclinical seizures, so keppra was increased to 1.5 g [**Hospital1 **] in consultation w/neuro-onc.
EEG continued to capture subclinical seizures at a decreased frequency after medication adjustment.
She continued to be clinically stable with no awareness of the seizures apart from urinary incontinence.
Given her increasing frequency of subclinical seizures, and the fact that she was otherwise medically stable, she was transferred to the epilepsy monitoring unit of [**Hospital1 18**].
Over the next several days, her AED dose and number were titrated to seizure frequency and sedation.
In addition, she would have episodes where she would have nystagmoid eye movements, diminished responsiveness and occasional flailing movements of her left (Strong) arm which were nonepileptic in nature.
During her stay here, it was noted that her examination changed further such that she became generally more lethargic and developed worsening right leg weakness.
A repeat MRI showed worsening of edema versus radiation necrosis changes with increased midline shift.
She has a flaccid right upper extremity paralysis, right facial weakness and gross asymmetry, lower extremity weakness (R>L) in an upper motor neuron fashion.

Discharge Instructions: Ms. [**Known lastname 69633**] was transferred to the epilepsy monitoring unit of the [**Hospital1 18**] for further treatment of subclinical seizures.
A repeat MRI of her brain showed worsening swelling around the region of her tumor, and subsequently her dose of dexamethasone (steroid) was increased.
