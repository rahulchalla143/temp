Admission Date:  [**2128-4-1**]     Discharge Date: [**2128-5-10**]  Date of Birth:   [**2083-12-8**]     Sex:  F  Service:  MICU/BMT  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 44-year-old Brazilian Portuguese-speaking female with past medical history of low back pain and "stomach problems".
She had a history of dental infection prior to admission, which was treated with one month of penicillin.
On admission laboratories at [**Hospital1 **], she was found to be pancytopenic with a white blood cell count of 0.9, hematocrit 24.3, platelets 49 with differential 21% neutrophils, 3% bands, 65% lymphocytes, 10% atypical cells.
Chest and abdominal CT scans demonstrated marked splenomegaly and diffuse hilar lymphadenopathy with multiple pulmonary nodules.
Biopsy was consistent with positive B-cell antigen, positive DBA 44, and positive CD45 RO all consistent with hairy cell leukemia.
The marrow itself was hypercellular with 5% fat composed almost entirely of infiltrating small lymphoid cells with round irregular nuclear contours and moderately abundant cytoplasm.
Sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli were negative x3.
She underwent bronchoscopy, which demonstrated no endobronchial lesions.
However, blood cultures from [**3-23**] and several other subsequent blood cultures grew out atypical rapidly growing mycobacterium.
Her [**Hospital **] hospital course was complicated by development of diffuse raised pruritic plaque-like rash beginning on [**2128-3-25**].
Skin biopsy by the Dermatology staff at [**Hospital1 **] showed pathology consistent with vasculitis and inflammatory infiltrates, mononuclear cells, and mixed eosinophils and rare neutrophils.
While she was at [**Hospital1 **], she had multiple changes to her antibiotic regimen.
Levofloxacin and amikacin were for atypical mycobacteria.
Finally at [**Hospital **] Hospital, she had frequent diarrhea with cultures reportedly negative.
Infectious workup including a transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated no evidence of vegetations.
She was seen by Pulmonary and Infectious Disease staff for sepsis, atypical mycobacterial infection, and left upper lobe pneumonia with compression of left upper lobe bronchus.
The [**Hospital 228**] Medical Intensive Care Unit course was complicated by persistent fevers and hypotension.
Also demonstrated marked pulmonary parenchymal consolidation most in the left perihilar region as well as more diffuse ground-glass opacities noted as well.
This is felt to be consistent with pulmonary edema versus atypical infection.
In light of the bladder distention and clonus on the neurological exam, she underwent a MRI of her complete spine, which showed only abnormal marrow consistent with leukemic infiltrate, but no evidence of cord compression, diskitis, osteomyelitis, or abscess.
Low back pain.
History of recurrent headaches.
[**Name (NI) **] brother has a history of diabetes mellitus.
Mother with breast cancer, father deceased from a myocardial infarction at age 74.
General appearance:  This was a thin, chronically ill-appearing female, in no acute distress.
No oropharyngeal lesions were noted.
A right internal jugular central venous line was in place with site clean, dry, and intact without any evidence of erythema or purulent discharge.
Jugular venous pressure was flat with no cervical lymphadenopathy.
Lungs were remarkable for bibasilar crackles with crackles [**1-3**] of the way up the left lung.
There is diffuse expiratory wheezing.
Cardiac examination was regular, rate, and rhythm, S1, S2 heart sounds auscultated, no S3, S4, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with positive normoactive bowel sounds.
There is no evidence of hepatomegaly.
Extremities were warm and well perfused with 2+ distal pulses and no evidence of clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Skin exam was remarkable for a desquamating erythematous papular rash with also plaque formation of her face, trunk, and extremities.
Hairy cell leukemia:  Hematology/Oncology service reviewed the patient's bone marrow biopsy slide from outside hospital and felt that it was consistent with hairy cell leukemia.
She had a bronchoscopy during this admission that demonstrated submucosal tumor infiltration as well as chest imaging that was concerning for lymphangitic spread of her tumor.
Atypical mycobacterial bacteremia:  Patient is followed by the Infectious Disease service, and was treated with moxifloxacin, clarithromycin, linezolid, amikacin, clindamycin to cover her postobstructive pneumonia and AmBisome to cover for fungal infection.
She was cultured repeatedly for temperature spikes including cultures of her blood, urine, stool, sputum.
History of left upper lobe infiltrate with bronchus compression:  On transfer to [**Hospital1 188**] from [**Hospital1 **], patient had a CT scan, which demonstrated a left upper lobe infiltrate with bronchus compression.
Workup included HIV testing, which was negative, transthoracic echocardiogram, which is negative for vegetations.
CT scan of the sinuses, which demonstrated minimal mucosal thickening.
Drainage of a left pleural effusion, which failed to grow any organism.
Bronchoscopy with brochialveolar lavage, which demonstrated submucosal infiltrating tumor, but no evidence of infection in any of the lavage samples.
After identification of her Mycobacterial infection by the state laboratory, her antibiotic coverage was narrowed to cover just this atypical infection as well as to cover for fever and neutropenia status post chemotherapy.
Hypoxia:  On [**2128-4-29**], the patient had an episode of an acute desaturation going from 96% oxygen saturation on 2 liters nasal cannula to 80% on a 100% nonrebreather face mask.
Chest x-ray was concerning for possible acute respiratory distress syndrome and worsening of a left upper lobe pneumonia.
She was therefore transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for monitoring of her respiratory status.
It was felt that a pulmonary embolus is possible, therefore the patient went for lower extremity ultrasounds, which are negative for DVT.
There was also concern that the patient's acute pulmonary edema could have been secondary to inflammation induced by chemotherapy with 2-CDA.
At the time of this dictation up til [**2128-5-1**] her blood pressure was stable with hypotension resolved.
Desquamating skin rash:  The patient developed a diffuse skin rash after treatment with Bactrim at [**Hospital1 **].
They felt that her rash is most likely related to Bactrim or cephalosporin use.
Diarrhea:  Patient had onset of diffuse watery diarrhea while at [**Hospital1 **].
It is felt that this is secondary to splenic radiation versus protein-losing enteropathy, which can be seen in some patients with hairy cell leukemia.
Transaminitis:  Patient experienced acute elevations in her liver function tests after administration of amphotericin at [**Hospital1 **].
There was also a small bump after initiation of anti-tuberculosis medications.
A CT scan of the abdomen to rule out liver involvement including masses or abscess was performed that was negative.
