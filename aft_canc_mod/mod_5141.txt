Today she presents from [**Hospital **] Rehab having had an acute onset of seizures involving the left face, arm, and leg, accompanied by loss of consciussness.
There was some urinary incontinence and the patient became very confused after the episode and essentially nonverbal, answering only yes or no.
The patient had never had a seizure before.
In the ED, a CT scan w/o contrast and an MRI/MRA showed possible posterior reversible encephalopathy or old subacute infarcts, possibly embolic.
Past Medical History:  - Paraimmunoblastic CLL with chromosome 17P deletion, as above  - Hiatal hernia - Lymph edema, LLL since [**2141**] (unknown etiology) - Cholecystectomy, [**2158-7-3**] - h/o DVT and PEs diagnosed in [**12-8**] (treated with Lovenox x 6 months, patient reports allergic reaction to Coumadin) - s/p IVC filter placement [**2159-12-28**] - h/o Obstructive Sleep Apnea - Chronic sinusitis - Clivus mass treated with 7 weeks fungal abx and 3-4 weeks meropenem without change, will need surgical bx at some point - Labile blood pressure (history of both HTN and hypotension) - h/o Depression - Heterozygous for antithrombin gene   Social History: She quit smoking 30 yrs ago but has a 20-pack-year history.
CV: RRR, Normal S1 + S2, No murmurs, rubs or gallops Resp: Crackles at bases bilaterally.
Biparietal low intensity white matter foci.
Differential diagnosis includes posterior reversible encephalopathy and venous infarctions from sagittal sinus thrombosis with tumor or infectious process.
Large lytic mass in the clivus.
MRI [**3-18**] IMPRESSION New increased t2 and flair signal noted within posterior pariteal lobes superior to ventricles and within deep left frontal [**Male First Name (un) 4746**] as noted on CT, with  slight increased signal on DWI, likely due to t2 shine through.
Overall exam  limited by motion, but clival mass and sinus thickening is without sign.
No sinus thrombosis noted.
Diff dx includes Posterior reversible encephalopathy (is there htn history),  or old subacute infarcts, possibly embolic given lesion location.
Again seen are low lung volumes without consolidation.
No pneumothorax is identified.
There is minimal  bibasilar atelectasis.
IMPRESSION: Persistent low lung volumes without evidence of pneumonia  EEG [**3-19**]  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due the occasional right and left central sharp waves, frequent large amplitude slow waves and the slow and disorganized background rhythm.
The first abnormality suggests a right and left central focus of cortical hypersynchrony.
The second two abnormalites suggest a moderate encephalopathy, which may be seen with toxic metabolic abnormalities, medication effect or infections .
[**3-20**] CXR:  Low lung volumes without consolidation or effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 60 year old woman with a hx of paraimmunoblastic CLL, s/p MUD allo transplant ~ 90 days post, hx of DVTs and PE on lovenox, who presented from [**Hospital **] Rehab having had an acute onset of seizures.
Seizure: Per the history, the patient had a partial complex seizure with generalization, witnessed by her niece.
No had hypoglycemia or lyte abnormalities upon presentation to [**Hospital1 18**].
No bleed or mass was found on imaging.
An EEG showed encephalopathy, but no seizure activity.
MR imaging of the brain was consistent with reversible posterior leukocencephelopathy of the brain which can be associated with seizures.
In Ms. [**Known lastname 66500**] case, her HTN was likely secondary to cyclosporine induce hypertension.
# Infectious/low grade temp: The patient presented with bandemia and a low grade temperature.
# dropping ANC and wbc ct: Prior to discharge it was noticed that the patient's ANC was slowly dropping.
DDx included med effect vs graft rejection.
She was volume depleted on admission and tachycardia resolved with a 1Liter bolus of normal saline.
Anemia also thought to be contributing to elevated HR, and the patient received two units PRBCs in the MICU.
# Hypercalcemia: this was thought to be mainly due to dehydration.
The hypercalcemia resolved with fluids.
# AMS: The altered mental status was thought to be a combination of her postictal state coupled with reversible posterior encephalopathy and cyclosporin toxicity.
# CLL s/p allo transplant 90 days: the cyclosporin levels were monitored on a daily basis and the patient was also maintained on her outpatient dose of prednisone.
# Hypercoagulable state.
Lovenox was briefly held for 12 hours prior to the patient having a lumbar puncture.
It was then restarted at the therapeutic doses the patient usually takes given her history of DVTs and PEs and heterozygosity for the antithrombin gene.
The patient had a speech and swallow evaluation and a nutrition consult.
#ACCESS - as she was afebrile and doing well, permanent vascular access was secured via surgery with the placement of a double-lumen port-a-cath.
