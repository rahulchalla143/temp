Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 9250**] is a 71yo man with history of MDS on Dacogen (last dose 5 weeks prior to admission), CAD, PAD, and DM who presented with sudden vision loss and eye pain and was found to have endocarditis with endophthalmitis.
# Endocarditis: His endophthalmitis was felt to be secondary to endogenous source, and bacteremia was suspected.
Patient underwent TEE on [**12-16**] which showed a small vegetation on his aortic valve consistent with endocarditis.
He was empirically treated with vancomycin and ceftaz for bacterial coverage and ambisome and doxycycline for fungal and atypical coverage.
# ID: Mr. [**Known lastname 9250**] is a 71 year old man with a history of MDS, [**Known lastname 1106**] disease who was admitted [**2105-12-14**] with 3-4 days of vision loss in the right eye, which occurred acutely at his home in [**State 108**].
A few weeks prior to this incident, he was treatedas an outpatient with Levofloxacin for an "URI" during which he had fevers to 103-104.
There has been no positive culture data during this hospitalization, except for two universal PCR's done on [**12-14**] vitreous fluid and [**12-25**] groin pus - Streptococcus agalactiae was isolated both times.
He continued to have fever to 101-102 on Daptomycin alone and upon the family's request on [**2106-1-28**], a three drug regimen to cover other nocosomial organisms (Aztreonam, Ciprofloxacin, and Metronidazole) was re-started.
Even if he continues to have higher fevers on this regimen, the antibiotic plan will be the same, unless there is new culture data to change therapy.
# Pururic skin lesions: Patient was noted to have a right medial malleolar palpable purpuric skin lesion on admission.
Over the next couple days, he developed scattered discrete skin lesions and one was biopsied by dermatology.
The biopsy showed acute necrotizing vasculitis and dermal abscess formation and noted "Although an immune-mediated vasculitis may be present, the dermal abscess formation is concerning for an infectious process."
This fluid was sent for gram stain which showed numerous polys but no microorgansims.
# Right shoulder pain: Patient complained of right shoulder pain which he had for approximately a week prior to admission.
MRI of the shoulder was poor quality but found supraspinatous rotator cuff tear.
There was no evidence of infection.
His pain was treated with oxycontin and oxycodone.
Other Info R shoulder pain: R shoulder pain and new left elbow pain: MRI of R shoulder poor quality but no clear signs of infection and rotator cuff tear.
Films of R shoulder and L elbow unremarkable.
Ortho feels these pains are MSK related and suggested rest with pain control/anti-inflammatories and eventual PT.
Rheum recommends consideration of AC joint tap to rule out infection; ortho has deferred on this and does not feel exam is c/w infxn.
Overall symptoms are improving and feeling sl better today with some improvement in ROM.
Patient usually takes a week of Neupogen as needed for neutropenia after the 5 days of dacogen.
Last BM bx in [**Month (only) 205**] showed some blast proliferation concerning for MDS conversion to leukemia.
Mr. [**Known lastname 9250**] has a history of MDS and was treated in [**10/2105**] with decitabine.
On presentation, he has anemia and thrombocytopenia that are less severe than previous.
Review of peripheral smear showed modest dysplastic changes but not blasts concerning for transformation to leukemia.
MDS may results in functional or absolute neutropenia and leukopenia that can result in infection and thereby fevers.
We favor ongoing infection or drug fever as the cause of Mr. [**Known lastname 27088**] fever.
# CAD, Chest Pain: Patient does not take aspirin at home given recent ASA induced gastritis but was started on this medication when his plavix was held in the hospital per his cardiologist's recommendation.
Pt did have a NSTEMI.
Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated native three vessel disease.
Final angiogram showed 0% residual stenosis, no dissection and normal flow in the distal vessel.
Other Cardiac: Elevated Troponins/Cardiac ischemia: Pt has significant hx of CAD with  coronary angioplasty and stenting [**2103**], CABG (LIMA to LAD, SVG to diagonal, SVG to OM, sequential.
His repeat Echo on [**12-29**] showed significant worsening LVF with EF decreasing from 50% to 30%.
# DM: His blood sugars were initially elevated but improved with sliding scale Humalog and evening Lantus.
Pt blood sugars stable on DC  # [**Month/Year (2) **] Brief: Incision and drainage of right groin abscess, radical debridement of right groin and sartorius muscle flap closure of groin wound [**12-25**] and Debridement and drainage of groin; removal of distal end of aortobifemoral graft and replacement with rifampin-soaked 8-mm interposition Dacron graft segment, complete removal of femoropopliteal graft, and oversewing of popliteal artery on [**1-7**].
Currenly patient has minimal bllod flow to foot.
Does  have collaterals.
Pt did have ischemic leg.
This was DC'd because of multiple GI blled.
# Vision loss: Patient with most likely diagnosis of endophthalmitis.
# Hypoxemia: Blood gas confirms hypoxemia.
Concominant respiratory alkalosis with hypocarbia points away from narcotic-induced hypoventilation as etiology.
Patient also with interstitial changes c/w interstitial fibrosis versus emphysema.
# Hyponatremia: Most likely secondary to hypovolemia given patient's history of very poor PO intake, dry MM, NS bolus 500cc x 1, Maintanaince fluids, Urine lytes.
# Elevated creatinine: Improving after IV fluids, back to baseline.
Could be related to ambisome or other medications.
On Dc creatinine is stable  # Pain management: Stopped all narcotics this AM given that pt has AMS likely due to delusion- with hallucinations and inattention which per family seems worse after receiving pain meds, continue to close monitor MS and pain management, Cont on tylenol PRN, Lidocaine patch  # Altered Mental Status: Pt alert and oriented x person.
He was previously evaluated by neuro for AMS and was found to be due to metabolic causes.
He does not have a neuro defecit.
He had head CT on [**12-28**] and head MRI on [**12-30**] that showed no acute process or changes when compared to prior MRI done on [**12-20**].
This does not appear to be infectious since he has no other menigitides symptoms.
There is also concern about septic emboli from ?
endocarditis and arterial graft infection, so ID recommended MRI of head for evaluation of septic emboli.
Again demonstrated is encephalomalacia in the right parietal region and scattered FLAIR/T2 hyperintensities within the cerebral white matter.
There is no evidence of interval hemorrhage, infarct, or mass.
Abnormal appearance to the right globe is similar to prior with T2 hypointense material present within the posterior globe.
No significant change compared to [**2105-12-20**].
Abnormal appearance of the right globe, compatible with the patient's known history of staphylococcal infection of his right globe.
This could be due to bone marrow supression from the antibiotics, infection or MDS.
His MDS initial presentation was thromcytopenia and his last chemo dose was 7 weeks ago, which he could be having bone marrow transformation of abnormal cells.
He has small hematoma at site of cath that is unchanged, Pt transfused multiple times, Pt put on IV protonix.
Pt did have scope showed GI bleed.
Grade 3 esophagitis in the gastroesophageal junction In the second part of the duodenum there was an adherent clot with blood extruding under the clot.
There was fresh blood in this area.
On injection of this area with 1/10,000 epi patient's heart rate and BP increased.
Pt c/w drop in HCT.
A single bleeding spot (?
There was no further oozing from the spot.
