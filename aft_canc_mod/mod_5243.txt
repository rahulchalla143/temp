CXR [**11-11**] AP PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST:  No prior studies available for comparison.
Although this radiograph is somewhat difficult to interpret due to patient positioning and low position of the left scapula/clavicle, there is a left apical airspace opacity with volume loss and traction bronchiectasis, likely chronic.
There may be a component of underlying emphysema.
IMPRESSION:  Left apical opacity with volume loss and traction bronchiectasis, likely chronic.
(Is there a history of malignancy, prior radiation, or tuberculosis?)
In the correct clinical setting, this could represent acute pneumonia, but this is thought less likely.
Stable left apical opacity, unclear if this is a chronic or an acute on chronic process, prior examinations would be useful.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
