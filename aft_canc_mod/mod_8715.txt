CT chest was done which showed a left sided infiltrate and a right sided filling defect with segmental PE.

At baseline, she is short of breath with walking more than a few steps.
She walks with a walker and has profound leg weakness due to a potential steroid myopathy that has been slowly getting better over the last several weeks.

Right pulmonary stable filling defect since [**2195-5-1**], in the absence of other sites of thrombi, this could represent tumor and/or in situ thrombus, particularly as it is directly adjacent to the site of resection.
Diffuse esophagitis.
Enhancing right moderately large pleural effusion, suspicious for a malignant effusion.
Moderately severe emphysema.
Diffuse ground-glass opacity, stable since [**2195-5-1**], but new since [**2195-3-10**], may represent diffuse drug reaction, atypical pneumonia or edema.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 year old female with stage IV lung cancer, CAD s/p MI, T2DM, Afib, and HTN who presents with new right sided PE and increased O2 requirement.
# CP/SOB: Patient had 3 episodes this admission of CP and SOB, which after much investigation (including CTA which showed no new process) was determined to be atrial fibrillation likely causing some pain with demand ischemia (but negative cardiac enzymes x3) and also severe GERD from esophagitis noted on CTA.
She has remained hemodynamically stable without evidence of overload.
Moderate right sided pleural effusion noted on CT scan could represent an empyema, however, this has been noted on prior CT scans making this less likely.
She was broadened to vanc + cefepime (day 1= [**5-3**]) given patient's exposure history and poor pulmonary reserve to cover for Pseudomonas and MRSA.
Atrial fibrillation: Has been in controlled afib w/ some spikes (as above) to HR in 140-150's.
# CAD s/p 2 stents - continued lifelong ASA .
Iron studies suggested anemia of chronic disease with significantly elevated ferritin.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 246**] Nursing Center - [**Location (un) 246**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pneumonia, pulmonary embolism Secondary: Stage IV lung cancer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **], You were seen in the hospital for shortness of breath.
It was found that you had a pulmonary embolism (a blood clot that travelled to your lungs).
In addition, you had pneumonia that was then treated with intravenous antibiotics.
While you were here you had multiple episodes of chest pain, shortness of breath and fast heart rates.
We determined that you were having atrial fibrillation and GERD, so we started you on a higher dose of heart medication called metoprolol and started you on Maalox four times a day to help treat and prevent GERD symptoms.
3) We STARTED you on SUBLINGUAL NITROGLYCERIN as needed for chest pain.
6) We STARTED you on ALBUTEROL NEBULIZERS every 2 hours as needed for shortnedd of breath or wheezing.
7) We STARTED you on MICONAZOLE POWDER four times a day as needed for itching with rash.
