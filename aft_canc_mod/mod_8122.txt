The patient originally presented to [**Hospital 487**] hospital on [**5-16**] with about 10 hrs of coolness and pain in her R foot that started about 10 PM the night before.
The pain originated in her thigh but then travelled down to the dorsum of her right foot where it persisted prior to admission.
The pain is not worsened by walking but is alleviated by pain medication and rest and she denies symptoms of claudication, leg swelling, or rest pain in the past.
Imaging revealed a pericardial effusion so Cardiology was consulted.
Pulsus was 6 but TTE showed evidence of tamponade physiology so she was taken to the cath lab for pericardiocentesis (apical approach).
TTE showed residual fluid, no tamponade.
On arrival to the ICU, patient is in pain from the groin site where the procedure took place earlier.
Feels tired but no other major complaints.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS (+): Mild DOE recently, after walking a few blocks.
Ongoing poor appetite and fatigue.
(-): No prior history of stroke, TIA, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

There is a large pericardial effusion.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
IMPRESSION: Large pericardial effusion with evidence tamponade physiology.
Echo ([**2154-5-17**]): Pre-pericardiocentesis (images [**1-18**]): Large circumferential pericardial effusion.

The left pelvic and left lower extremity vasculature beyond the aortic bifurcation is widely patent.
Large left partially loculated pleural effusion with a Pleurx catheter in place and little aeration of the visualized left lobe.
Moderate pericardial effusion.
Numerous hyperenhancing hepatic lesions and sclerotic bony foci, likely metastatic disease in the setting of known breast cancer.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Small circumferential pericardial effusion w/o echocardiographic signs of tamponade physiology.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
If clinicallly indicated, serial evaluation is suggested.

There is abnormal septal motion/position.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Small anterior pericardial effusion w/o echocardiographic signs of tamponade physiology.
There is a septal bounce seen, consistent with effusive-constrictive physiology - commonly seen in the first week post pericardiocentesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
Small anterior pericardial effusion with likely cellular debris overlying the free wall of the right ventricle.
No evidence of tamponade.
Septal bounce, consistent with effusive-constrictive physiology post pericardiocentesis.
Pericardial Biopsy [**2154-5-22**]: Pericardium (A): Poorly differentiated carcinoma consistent with breast origin, (see note).
CXR [**2154-5-24**] INDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**5-23**], there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
The apparent engorgement of pulmonary vessels on the previous study has substantially decreased.
Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe.
Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF PATIENT SUMMARY: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 49 y/o lady with metastatic breast cancer who presented with cold right foot, now s/p intervention for arterial thrombus who was found to have pericardial effusion with tamponade for which she is s/p pericardiocentesis.
Pericardial Effusion: The patient presented with evidence of a pericardial effusion with evidence of tamponade physiology on echo.
patient is s/p pericardiocentesis with no current evidence of tamponade.
Pericardial fluid analysis revealed no bacteria on gram stain and no growth on culture.
Repeat TTE after removal of drain, performed on [**2154-5-20**], demonstrated no significant increase in pericardial fluid.
Patient had pericardial window in the OR by thoracic surgery team on [**5-22**].
A pericardial drain was placed, and subsequently removed once drainage had decreased and patient was stable on anticoagulation.
Her malignancy makes her hypercoagulable, but the fact that she developed an arterial thrombus while on Lovenox is difficult.
Hypotension: hypotension periodically to SBP 70s-80s, fluid responsive.
Likely volume depleted (poor PO intake, might be 3rd spacing into pleural effusion).
Pain meds might have a very minimal contribution as well.
It is very reassuring that she was mentating fine with no lab evidence of end-organ malperfusion.
Pt received multiple boluses of IVF on night of [**2154-5-18**], for a total of approximately 4L fluid.
# Anemia: Pt?????
?s Hct on admission 37.9 --> 31.8, likely secondary to hemoconcentration on admission.
?s Hct further dropped from 27.8 --> 24.4 night of [**5-18**], in the setting of receiving 3-4L IVF, and also other cell lines decreased, so now may have a component of hemodilution.
No e/o bleeding (no bloody or melenic bowel movements, no overt bleeding from surgical wound) aside from small amount of bloody drainage from pericardial drain.
hemolysis and DIC labs unremarkable.
She was on Lovenox (100mg daily) as an outpatient, but she had a LE arterial thrombus on Lovenox (daily dosing).
Metastatic to bone, liver, stomach, and likely lung - recurrent left sided pleural effusions s/p repeated drainage and left pleural catheter placement [**5-15**].

You were transferred to [**Hospital1 **] Hospital because you had a clot in your right lower extremity artery.
The vascular surgery team removed the clot and decompressed the swelling in your leg with a fasciotomy.
While you were here you were found to have fluid collected around your heart.
You were then transferred to the oncology service for chemotherapy, and were started on navelbine and herceptin.
We made the following changes to your medications: STARTED: -Standing Acetaminophen for pain -Oxycodone for pain -Senna and colace to help you move your bowels  INCREASED Lovenox to 70mg twice daily.
