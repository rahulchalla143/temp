Admission Date:  [**2132-4-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-5-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2090-7-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 552**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea and hypoxia following resection of left renal mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: L nephrectomy Bronchoscopy   History of Present Illness: This is a 41 year old man with a PMH significant for Factor V Leiden mutation, who is now POD2 s/p resection of a left renal mass, who had episodes of oxygen desaturation on the floor and for whom a CT showed likely mucus plugging.
He originally presented with back pain and in the process of workup for this got an MRI which incidentally showed a 2 cm left renal mass.
He came to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for urological follow-up, who scheduled and, on [**4-22**], performed an open partial nephrectomy to resect the mass.
At that time, the covering MD noted that he was "asymptomatic" without SOB, CP, dyspnea, N/V, chills, or calf pain.
A PE protocol CT chest was ordered stat, and a provisional read showed "Small left pneumothorax... [and] obstructive atelecatsis of the left lower lobe and right middle and lower lobe due to fillings of the lower lobe bronchi, most likely mucous plug."
An EKG done around that time appears to show diffuse T-wave flattening compared to his earlier pre-op EKG but otherwise without diagnostic focal changes.

Given a borderline suboptimal study, there is no pulmonary embolism to the segmental level.
Obstruction of the bronchus intermedius and all segmental bronchi of the left lower lobe, likely due to mucus plugging, causing complete collapse of the middle lobe, right lower lobe, and almost all the left lower lobe.
New dependent opacities in the left upper lobe, lingula and less in the right upper lobe, could be due to aspiration.
Extensive post-operative changes of left partial nephrectomy.
Small left pneumothorax.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Mild left ventricular hypertrophy.
Brief Hospital Course: 41 yo M w PMHx of Factor V leiden mutation and DVT, L renal mass sp partial L nephrectomy w post-op complications of fever, hypoxia .

Pt needed to be on bipap w high oxygen requirement which was been weaned down to RA.
Low grade temps likely to resolving cdiff colitis.
Pt reports that diarrhea is getting better.
Hx of L renal mass sp partial nephrectomy - Urology following.
Path report from nephrectomy shows angiomyolipoma, no cancer.
Hx of Factor V Leiden mutation and DVT - seen by heme preop and coumadin w goal INR of [**12-31**].5 4-6 weeks post op.
Anemia - likely from post-op blood loss.remained stable throughout hospital stay around 30-31. .
R flank discomfort - At one point pt complained of R flank pain, likely MSK but was resolved at dc.
UA only showed 13 RBC, not concerning for renal stone.
pain resolved on its own .
# ?CKD- Baseline Cr ~1.2, given young age, nl for pt his age.

After surgery you developed complications of mucus plugging and pneumonia.
You also developed an infection of your bowel called C diff colitis.
If at the end of the oral antibiotic course you are still having diarrehea, abdominal pain or fevers, you need to let your doctor know as you may need additional antibiotics.
You have hx of factor V leiden mutation which makes you vulnerable to form blood clots especially around surgery, so per your hematologist, you have been placed on coumadin which will be continued for about 4-6 weeks after your surgery.
Please follow up with them regarding INR checks and coumadin adjustment Please call your doctor right away or return to ED for fevers, chills, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of [**Last Name (LF) 1440**], [**First Name3 (LF) 691**] concerning signs of infection at the incision site, worsening diarrhea  Followup Instructions: 1.
