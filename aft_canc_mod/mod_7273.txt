History of Present Illness: 65F with recurrent breast cancer on chemo with carboplatin, taxotere, Herceptin (last chemo [**2134-7-19**], Neulasta [**2134-7-20**]) transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from the radiology suite after a questionable anaphylactic reaction (dyspnea, hypoxia, tachycardia, and flushing) to IV contrast for CTA vs worsening volume overload.
Briefly, she presented to the ED with fever to 104 and rigors at home, with no obvious source of infection except for HSV-2 vaginal rash and chest rash.
She was also being evaluated for a rash on her chest thought to be a hypersensitivity rash related to chemotherapy; she was supposed to start a course of oral prednisone but had not yet started.
Pt denies dyspnea, cough and chest pain (other than at the skin at the site of rash).
Patient denied any urinary symptoms except some burning related to vaginal herpes rash; also complained of abdominal pain and loose stools over the last few days.
She did endorse nausea at the time but denied emesis, and had not had nausea at home.
On the floor, she was given 20mg IV Lasix for possible fluid overload (she was recently started on a thiazide over the last few weeks due to some edema).
Apparently after receiving IV contrast, she became dyspneic and tachycardic to the 170s.
Patient appeared less tachypneic and stated that her dyspnea was improving.In the [**Name (NI) 153**] pt continued broad spectrum antibiotics which were narrowed to vancomycin after blood cultures returned back positive for MSSA.

She developed tachycardia and dyspnea/hypoxia during a CTA chest to rule out PE, so was transferred to the ICU from the radiology suite.
In the ICU, she had fever to 104, rigors, and hypotension, then developed worsening dyspnea/hypoxia after fluid rescusitation in the ED and was found to have MSSA sepsis.

Losartan was held since 1st day of admission due to hypotension.
Vancomycin started [**2134-7-30**], then changed to cefazolin due to sensitivities and PCN allergy.
TTE negative for endocarditis, but did show new RV dilatation (see above).
TEE negative for endocarditis.
Repeat U/A still showing WBCs, but now symptoms, so no change in antibiotics.

Staphylococcus aureus sepsis (severe blood infection).
Drug rash infected with Staph aureus bacteria.
Shortness of [**Last Name (un) 1440**] and hypoxia (low oxygen levels).
Hypotension (low blood pressure).
Congestive heart failure.
Anemia (low red blood cell count).
Abnormal liver function tests.
Port pocket infection.
You developed shortness of [**Last Name (un) 1440**], low oxygen levels, and a fast heart rate.
During a CT scan, your vital signs and symptoms worsened.
So you were transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and started on antibiotics for sepsis, a severe infection of the blood.
Blood and skin cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus, a bacteria known to stick to different parts of the body.
An echo of the heart on the skin surface and one internally (TEE) were both negative for infections of the heart valves, but did show a mild dilation of the right ventricle heart chamber.
Cardiology was consulted and they felt that the right ventricle dilation was very mild and required no specific therapy.
Although the source of the infection was likely the skin rash, your port was removed in case the bacteria seeded it and when it was removed, it looked like infection may have been present in the area of the port.
