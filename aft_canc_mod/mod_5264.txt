Admission Date:  [**2140-9-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2140-9-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-11-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10644**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1) US guided paracentesis 2) right IJ 3) ERCP   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 18323**] is a 41 year old female with history of metastatic melanoma status post recent spinal fusion surgery for multiple metastatic spinal lesions, recently discharged from the surgical service on [**2140-8-31**], who was transferred from an OSH today with severe abdominal pain.
On [**8-31**] (the day of discharge), at around midnight she was awoken from sleep by the sudden onset of LLQ abdominal pain which she cannot quantify or qualify, but states that it felt as though her abdomen was bursting open.
Her pain then migrated to the LUQ and has remained a diffuse pain in the epigastric region.
The pain does not radiate to her back and she cannot report a certain position which makes the pain better.
She denies cough, chest discomfort, difficulty urinating, worsening of her back pain, focal weakness, change in bowel or bladder habits.
She was thus transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer monitoring, pain control and fluid resuscitation.
Path demonstrated superficial spreading melanoma, max depth of 1.3 mm, [**Doctor Last Name **] level IV with no ulceration and lymphovascular invastions.
s/p re-excision on [**2136-3-23**] - no residual melanoma [**4-18**] LN negative.
Developed back pain 4 mths ago which did not resolve with pain meds and MRI demonstrated on [**8-9**] demonstrated signal change @ L3 and L4 and a paraspinal mass R iliac creast and metastatic lesion in S2 vertebral body.
Medial LL mass, [**2140-8-12**]- negative CT of head, bone scan demonstrated increased uptake.
Additionally tender R anterior cervical LAD.
Cor: RR, tachycardic, no m/r/g.
No guarding, mild rebound.
Oblique incision with intact sutures extending across L flank - mild erythema, no exudate.
MRI Spine [**9-2**]:  Soft tissue mass involving L4, L5 and R psoas, extending into retroperitoneum.
Findings consistent with mild pancreatitis by CT with no drainable collections.
Interval laminectomies and spinal fusion hardware spanning the region of the previously identified pathological fracture of L4.
There is a large amount of associated fluid and foci of gas anterior to the spine at this level along the left psoas muscle and in the periaortic region.
This is presumably postoperative in nature but the possibility of infection cannot be entirely excluded.
Redemonstration of numerous metastatic lesions with evidence for disease progression given slight interval increase in size over the short time interval.
This is best demonstrated by the increase in size of the pancreatic head mass.
Interval increase in development of multiple cysts within the kidneys.
Brief Hospital Course: ## Pancreatitis - pt found to have pancreatitis with elevation of amylase and lipase.
MRCP was done which showed proximal pancreatic duct obstruction by tumor with distal dilation.
After some improvement in abdominal pain and decrease in amylase and lipase, an ERCP was performed with stenting of her pancreatic duct.
Pt's abdominal pain gradually improved and amylase and lipase normalized.
## Abdominal distention - pt developed increasing abdominal distension thought to be secondary to narctoics for pain control and bed rest.
She was encouraged to ambulate and given an aggressive bowel regimen.
Also patient had ascites thought to be secondary to malignant spread.
Patient was given IV lasix with good diuresis and underwent US guided paracentesis with drainage of 1.4 liters of bloody ascitic fluid.
## Fever, leukocytosis: pt experienced sporadic low grade fevers which were attributed to her pancreatitis.
Labs did not reveal a left shift or bandemia.
She remained without cough despite question of pneumonia on a portable X-ray.
Initially she was started on levofloxacin, but this was discontinued due to abscence of symptoms and she remained without any cough or clinical worsening following this.
Pt's prior spine surgeyr sites were monitored and no evidence of infection was found.
## Melanoma:  patient with dramatic spread of disease over several weeks since prior hospitalization.
Some R neck fullness initially noted, neck U/S with heterogeneous masses consistent with metastases.
Patient's hypertension was thought to be related to melanoma involvement of her adrenal gland as seen previously on abdominal CT. .
