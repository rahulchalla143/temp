The next day, he again experienced the pain while walking and made an appointment with his PCP.
Stress test revealed anginal symtoms on exercise with 3 mm ST-segment depressions on ECG.
Nuclear portion was positive for a large, reversible, severe perfusion defect involving the LAD territory, a small, reversible, mild perfusion defect involving the PDA territory, transient cavity dilation, consistent with multi-vessel disease, and mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction with apical and distal inferior hypokinesis, consistent with stunning.

Echocardiography revealed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, mild dilation of the aortic root, moderate dilation of the descending aorta, mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets with mild aortic regurgitation, mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets with mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
That night, the patient developed a 30 minute run of rapid atrial fibrillation which was treated with IV lopressor and then IV amiodarone.
