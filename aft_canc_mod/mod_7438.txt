Admission Date:  [**2198-4-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2198-4-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2126-2-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Dilantin Kapseal  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: T7-8 lesion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**4-4**] T5-9 laminectomy and mass resection at T7-8   History of Present Illness: This is a 72 year old right handed female with a history of left frontal lobe atypical meningioma grade II s/p resection (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and radiation in [**2192**] with chronic incontinence and executive function difficulties subsequently, now presents with progressive worsening of RLE weakness.
The gait instability was also associated with increased incontinence.
Due to these symptoms, the patient was seen by neuro-oncology for workup of possible recurrent meningioma.
She underwent an MRI (head), which was negative for recurrence.
She subsequently saw a neuromuscular neurologist for evaluation of persistent weakness, and was noted to have decreased power in the right leg with decreased sensation in the left leg, with no accurate sensory level.
The cervical spine MR [**First Name (Titles) 654**] [**Last Name (Titles) 104941**] and canal narrowing, but no cord impingement.
Following these appointments, she had progressive worsening of the RLE weakness.
She became unable to bear any weight on R leg and cannot ambulate without full assist.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: At time of discharge: BUE full strength BLE exam limited to pain and patient effort, but antigravity throughout.
MR OF THE C-SPINE: Multilevel, multifactorial degenerative changes, with moderate canal stenosis at C5-6, at C6-7 and mild-to-moderate at C4-5 level from disc osteophyte complex and ligamentum flavum thickening, with effacement of the CSF space and deformity on the cord at C5-6 and C6-7 levels ventrally along with moderate-to-severe foraminal narrowing, with possible impingement on the nerves in this location.
Area of altered signal intensity in the posterior spinous soft tissues and in the posterior epidural space, with displacement of the cord anteriorly, this may relate to a combination of blood products, recent surgical changes/inflammatory changes.
While there is anterior displacement of the cord, the appearance of the cord is significantly improved compared to the preoperative study when it was significantly compressed.
Small focus of T2 signal intensity in the cord at T8 level may relate to edema/myelomalacia, less likely infarct and a small focus of this was seen on the prior study, however, this appears more prominent on the present study.
Consider close followup to assess stability/progression and evaluation for any residual tumor.
The angiogram showed no large feeders of the thoracic lesion and she was prepared for resection on [**4-4**].
She went to the operating room and underwent a T5-9 laminectomy and t7-8 mass resection on the mornign of [**4-4**].
On the morning of [**4-5**] she was noted to have no spontaneous movement of her RLE or movement to command.
She underwent a Cervical and Thoracic spine MRI on [**4-5**] which showed multiple ares of degenerative chnages without cord impingement and post-operative chnages.
She had some pain and ultram was prescribed on [**4-7**].
