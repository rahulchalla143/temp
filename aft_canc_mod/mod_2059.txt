HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was a 66 year old female with a 50 pack year smoking history who presented with six weeks of facial swelling.
The patient presented to the outside hospital on [**2196-11-14**] with one month of facial swelling, shortness of breath with minimal exertion and blood-tinged sputum.
The patient had a chest computerized tomography scan at the outside hospital which reportedly showed an extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 33**] for tissue diagnosis.
On [**2196-11-17**], a bronchoscopy showed abnormal mucosa in the bronchus intermedius, however, biopsies were nondiagnostic for malignancy.
A mediastinoscopy was then done which revealed a firm lymph node mass directly inferior to the innominate vein in the pretracheal and right paratracheal region.
Biopsy of the mass was consistent with nonsmall cell cancer and later reported as large cell lung carcinoma.
After biopsy, significant bleeding was seen and this incision site was packed with Surgicel.
Hospital course at the outside hospital was significant for hypertension requiring frequent doses of Labetalol.
The patient also received large doses of sedation for agitation including Fentanyl, Ativan, Morphine, Versed and two doses of             .
Chest x-ray from the outside hospital was consistent with interstitial edema and bibasilar air space disease as per report.
Sputum cultures from the outside hospital, positive for gram positive cocci.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, history of shoulder fracture in [**2182**].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, neck appears swollen symmetrically.
Cervical lymphadenopathy could also not be assessed.
There is bilateral periorbital edema.
The patient also had upper extremity edema bilaterally, right slightly greater than left.
Lungs, diffuse rhonchi bilaterally.
Abdomen soft, nontender, positive bowel sounds.
Positive areas of erythematous silvery plaques on extensive surfaces of the upper extremities.
There was notable 4+ upper extremity edema and no lower extremity edema.
Breasts, right breast with a peau d'orange appearance, however, no masses were felt.
Chest x-ray from outside report on [**11-18**], mild interstitial edema, bibasilar air space disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary this is a 66 year old female with newly diagnosed large cell lung carcinoma complicated by SVC syndrome and airway obstruction who came to [**Hospital6 1760**] intubated.
Pulmonary - Large cell lung carcinoma complicated by SVC syndrome and airway obstruction.
Until hospital day #10 the patient was noted not to have any air leak and it was thought that she had extrinsic compression of her trachea by her diffuse mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
The patient had a computerized tomography scan of the trachea on [**11-28**] after eight to nine doses of radiation which showed trachea that was patent with improvement in its caliber and less extrinsic compression seen on previous computerized tomography scan.
There was also continued evidence of soft tissue enhancement of the trachea extending to the level of the right main stem bronchus.
There were also multifocal areas of air space opacities improved in some areas but worse in other areas suggestive of multifocal aspiration or pneumonia and there was also SVC obstruction.
After it was established that the patient had a significant air leak, she had a bronchoscopy done by Interventional Pulmonology which showed extrinsic compression of the right middle lobe bronchus, however, significant air movement was seen in the right middle lobe bronchus and it was felt that the patient could be safely extubated without need of stent in the right middle lobe bronchus.
There was also noted to be copious secretions consistent with a post obstructive pneumonia.
The patient was extubated on hospital day #12 without complications.
She required frequent suctioning due to secretions and required both nasal cannula and high flow oxygen to maintain a saturation above 90%.
It was thought that the patient had an element of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease given her smoking history and wheezing on examination.
In terms of her right middle lobe collapse, due to extrinsic compression and marked middle lobe bronchus it was thought that the patient should be carefully observed, however, stent was not needed at this time.
It was also thought, that due to the patient's habitus and paradoxical breathing pattern with sleeping that the patient most likely had an element of sleep apnea.
It was also noted that the patient had a persistent elevated right hemidiaphragm on serial chest x-rays.
It was thought that due to the patient's cancer and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, that she most likely had paralysis of the right phrenic nerve.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 44983**] from the Department of Anesthesia evaluated the patient's diaphragmatic movement with ultrasound at the bedside.
The patient's mental status appears to be approaching baseline and it is not thought that the patient has lost her gag due to decreased mental status or medication effect.
There may be involvement of tumor and loss of her gag reflex.
On head computerized tomography scan no metastatic disease was found, however, the patient had significant sinusitis involving both maxillary sinuses.
Delta Multiple sclerosis - It was noted that post extubation the patient had confusion and delirium.
Oncology - The patient had a chest computerized tomography scan which showed a right middle lobe dominant lesion of approximately 2 cm.
Given the lymph node biopsy of large cell, carcinoma was thought most likely that the patient's primary tumor is large cell lung carcinoma.
Hypernatremia - The patient had significant hypernatremia during this admission with sodiums of up to 148.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient no longer has an nasogastric tube and is pending a speech and swallow evaluation.
Cardiac - Given that the patient has an enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest x-ray and some evidence of interstitial edema an echocardiogram was obtained.
This showed global HK with an ejection fraction of approximately 45%.
The patient has no known history of coronary artery disease.
No further cardiac workup has been pursued.
Urinary tract infection - The patient had a Klebsiella urinary tract infection during this hospitalization which has been pansensitive to antibiotics.
