RADIOLOGY  Final Report CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2184-6-13**] 5:04 PM HISTORY: 45-year-old male status post total abdominal colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis, now with fevers and increased abdominal pain.
While oral contrast does not reach the site of anastomosis, lack of extraluminal gas at the site of anastomosis and intact suture line make an anastomotic leak less likely.
Fluid within the pelvis and abdomen, and small pockets of air, consistent with recent surgery.
Soft tissue mass along the right flank, nodular densities along the left flank, and soft tissue stranding in the right paraspinal region, unchanged.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
Postoperatively he was transferred to the ICU for observation given his cardiac history.

He developed some incisional erythema and was febrile, so was started on Kefzol.
He regained bowel function on POD 3, and had some diarrhea so was started on Immodium.
He continued to have low grade fevers and erythema of the wound.
On POD [**6-15**] he had a CT scan to rule out anastomotic leak and intraabdominal collections, which was negative for both.
