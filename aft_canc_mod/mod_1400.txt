DIRECT INFLUENZA B ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2171-10-25**]):       Negative for Influenza B.  BCx - negative x2 [**Last Name (un) **] Legionella - negative UCx - negative  IMAGING: [**2171-10-25**] ECHO: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis.
Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade I (mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-9-2**], the degree of aortic stenosis has increased.
The prior echo did not mention the presence of aortic stenosis, which was an error.
Patchy opacities extending from the hila to the lung periphery bilaterally, right greater than left, suggests asymmetric pulmonary edema or an infectious process.
Small right pleural effusion.
Coronary angiography in this right dominant system was not performed given the patients known totally occluded LCx and RCA.
The SVG-LPL had diffuse disease with patent stents and normal flow.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP 15 mmHg and PCWP 17 mmHg.
There was moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with PASP 44 mmHg.
The systemic vascular resistance was mildly low at 684 dynes-sec/cm5.
The pulmonary vascular resistance was mildly elevated at 204 dynes-sec/cm5.
There was mild systemic arterial systolic hypotension with SBP 95 mmHg.
Elevated filling pressures.
There has been minimally improved moderate pulmonary edema.
Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity is persistent.
There is no pneumothorax.

# Acute on Chronic diastolic CHF: Currently appears euvolemic with no pedal edema or crackles but labs note pt is intravscularly dry.
Exacerbation consistant with increased Na load before admission and with likely ischemia during hospital stay.
Cardiac catheterization did not show any lesions amenable to intervention.
Imdur was increased to prevent ischemic episodes and Norvasc was started to replace nifedipine.
Extensive teaching done with pt and daughter about CHF prevention and monitoring.
Pt has been referred to CHF specialists and will see them next week.
# CAD s/p CABGx2 and multiple stents, currently on medical management: cardiac catheterization with no lesions amenable to intervention.
Likely experiencing microvascular ischemia leading to repeat episodes of pulmonary edema.
# HTN: Currently controlled.
# Acute on Chronic kidney injury: creatinine inc today to 1.9 after brisk diuresis, very likely pre-renal.
# MDS/ Chronic Normocytic Anemia: Patient has known chronic anemia at baseline thought [**12-31**] myelodysplasia.
# Diabetes type 2: hyperglycemia improved with lantus dose and regular insulin sliding scale.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] if you have chest pain.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Care Tenders  Discharge Diagnosis: Coronary Artery disease Acute on Chronic Kidney disease Acute on chronic Diastolic congestive Heart failure Diabetes Mellitus Myelodysplastic syndrome   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane)   Discharge Instructions: You had 2 episodes of congestive heart failure that required you be treated with a ventilator to breathe.
Start taking Norvasc to prevent chest pain.
