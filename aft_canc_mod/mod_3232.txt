POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.
PROCEDURES:  Minimally invasive esophagogastrectomy, bronchoscopy and esophageal gastroscopy.
INDICATIONS:  This gentleman has a mid esophageal squamous cell carcinoma that has been treated with neoadjuvant treatment.
There was no evidence of tumor involvement of the trachea or of the bronchi.
There were no areas of significant airway narrowing or mucous plugging.
On slow withdrawal, we were able to see that actually the mucosa of the esophagus looked normal and there was actually no evidence of any gross tumor, indicating an excellent response to the neoadjuvant treatment.
There were a number of anthracotic nodes present.
There was no evidence of metastases in the chest.
The diaphragm was sutured and pulled downwards through a short stab wound in order to provide maximum exposure.
The lymphatic tissue was taken off of the pericardium and off of the inferior pulmonary vein on the right which was seen easily.
The esophagus was encircled at that level and we were able to dissect up into the root of the neck and thoracic inlet, staying right on the esophageal musculature itself.
Another Penrose drain was then placed around the esophagus and we used this to work downwards, dissecting the area off of the left inferior pulmonary vein which was also seen clearly.
A small amount of tissue was left in the area of the thoracic duct which was left undisturbed.
FINDINGS:  There were no obviously involved lymph nodes.
There was a small replaced left hepatic artery.
We started in the distal stomach and worked our way around the greater curvature and then up and divided all of the short gastrics.
We then were able to dissect the right crus away from the esophagus ventrally and sling the esophagus and associated lymphatic tissue with a Penrose drain.
A branch of the left gastric artery was identified right at the level of the left crus and this was clipped with clips.
We then formed our gastric tube with multiple runs of the [**Female First Name (un) 3224**] stapler using thick tissue staples.
A small amount of tissue was cut away right on the esophagus.
With Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] in the neck and I in the abdomen, we were able to pass the stomach graft up through the chest into the neck with a lot of redundant stomach which was quite healthy being in the neck.
A 60 mm stapler was used.
The specimen was sent off to the pathologist with findings of no evidence of mucosal tumor.
One #24 chest tube to the left chest as it was seen to be violated during our last part of our laparoscopic dissection.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2171-10-4**] 3:12 PM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: please eval tube positions and r/o PTX  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 75 year old man s/p minimally invasive esophagectomy w/ ETT, B/L CT's REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please eval tube positions and r/o PTX INDICATION: Status post minimally invasive esophagectomy.
Surgical staples overlying the left apex and multiple mediastinal staples are identified.
There appears to be a mediastinal drain entering at the incision site.
Bilateral small pneumothoraces are identified.
The lungs demonstrate stable chronic changes at the bases bilaterally.
No infiltrate or consolidation is identified.
No large pleural effusions are seen.
Satisfactory position of multiple lines and tubes.
Again note is made of small right apical pneumothorax.
There is consolidation in left lower lobe, persistent since prior study.
Persistent right apical pneumothorax.
Unchanged left lower lobe opacity.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2171-10-8**] 6:50 PM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: Please r/o pneumothorax  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 75 year old man s/p minimally invasive esophagectomy w/ ETT, B/L CT's s/p removal of left CT REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please r/o pneumothorax INDICATION: Status post minimally invasive esophagectomy.
A small amount of radiopaque contrast material is seen within the lower portion of the gastric pull up, related to recent fluoroscopic evaluation.
The lungs are relatively well aerated, with small areas of atelectasis adjacent to the mediastinum.
No definite pneumothorax (the right apical pneumothorax appears resolved).
IMPRESSION: Post-left chest tube removal, there is no definite pneumothorax.
The right apical pneumothorax appears resolved on the current study.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  ESOPHAGUS  [**2171-10-8**] 10:37 AM  ESOPHAGUS  Reason: R/O esophageal [**Month/Day/Year 3564**] with thin barium swallow studyIf any pro  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 75 year old man with esophageal ca, s/p esophagogastrectomy [**10-4**] REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: R/O esophageal [**Month/Year (2) 3564**] with thin barium swallow studyPLEASE DO NOT USE GASTROGRAFFINIf any problems, or +[**Name2 (NI) 3564**], please page HO, #[**Numeric Identifier 1629**] INDICATION: Esophagogastrectomy four days ago.
LIMITED BARIUM ESOPHAGOGRAM: Scout image shows staples over the left sternoclavicular joint, left neck drain, right-sided mediastinal drain, nasogastric tube terminating at the diaphragmatic hiatus, and cardiomegaly with atelectasis.
Thin barium was administered to the patient, and fluoroscopic images obtained, showing no evidence of [**Numeric Identifier 3564**].
These were repeated in orthogonal projections, again demonstrating no evidence of [**Numeric Identifier 3564**].
IMPRESSION: No evidence of [**Numeric Identifier 3564**] at anastomosis.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2171-10-9**] 12:23 PM  CHEST (PA & LAT)  Reason: please evaluate for pneumothorax/effusion  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 75 year old man with recent laparoscopic esophagogastrectomy w/ a cervical anastamosis REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please evaluate for pneumothorax/effusion REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient after laparascopic esophagogastrectomy.
The pleural surfaces are smooth with small left pleural effusion.
A small rounded opacity in the right lower lung is grossly unchanged comparing to the previous film and most likely represents fluid in the tract of a prior chest tube.
No evidence of pneumothorax is present.

He was NPO with intravenous hydration with a Dilaudid PCA for pain.
Post-operatively he was tachycardic in the 110's, EKG was without changes, cardiac enzymes showed mild elevation in Troponin, his hematocrit was 25.4, he was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells; follow-up cardiac enzymes were normal, repeat hematocrit was 29, and he was continued on intravenous beta-blockade.
On POD 4 his left chest tube was removed with repeat x-ray demonstrating no pneumothorax.
On POD 5 he had an episode of atrial fibrillation which was converted to sinus rhythm with additional beta-blockade, he remained normotensive, and hemodynamically stable with a hematocrit of 31.3.
His pain medication was changed to Morhpine elixir with improved pain control.
He was provided prescriptions for: Metoprolol, Colace elixir, Lansoprazole disintegrating tabs, Morphine elixir, Albuterol inhaler, and Guaifenesin elixir as needed for occasional cough at bedtime.
