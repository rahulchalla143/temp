Initially presented to an OSH on [**3-1**] with hip pain severe enough to make him unable to ambulate.
A CT abdomen showed focal fluid collection along the superficial posterolateral aspect of the right hip.
Blood cultures grew out GPC in pairs/chains/cluters and he underwent fluoroscopic guided aspiration of the THR on [**3-2**].
Also noted to have elevated troponins (0.113, 0.541, 0.91) and was started on Lovenox 60mg SC BID.

There is acetabular protrusio.
No periprosthetic lucency to suggest loosening is identified.
No true lateral view is identified, and there is overlying trauma board artifact.
There is evidence of osteopenia and probable degenerative change, not well assessed on this exam.
There is some subchondral lucencies -- the appearance is not typical for osteomyelitis and is more likely to represent osteopenia.
No suspicious focal lytic or sclerotic lesion to confirm the presence of osteomyelitis is identified.
CXR [**2202-3-3**]: there is again diffuse prominence of interstitial markings.
The findings are again consistent with pulmonary edema, though some chronic pulmonary disease cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 62 year-old man with a history of prior THR and septic hip; again presenting with septic joint and bacteremia.
Septic joint / bacteremia: The patient presented to an outside hospital as above with pain, elevated WBC/ESR, GPC bacteremia and GPC on aspirate from hip.
Post op he became febrile to 102 with new levophed requirement, which subsequently improved without change in antibiotics.
# L foot osteomyelitis / lower extremity ulcers.
Plain films were without clear evidence of osteomyelitis but he was debrided and cultured by podiatry.
Lower extremity ulcers monitored and adressed by plastics.
Prior to discharge the podiatry service felt as if the surgical wound was well-healed and signed-off.
# Epidural abscess of cervical spine:  During his course the patient developed swelling of his left arm followed by weakness of proximal muscles.
Finally, a cervical spine MRI showed evidence of phlegmon, discitits, osteo at C5-6.
OR cultures were negative but as above he will continue an 8 week course of antibiotics starting from his OR date of [**3-18**].
# LGIB: The patient developed an episode of large bright red blood per rectum on [**3-9**]; had tagged RBC study showing bleed within 6 minutes.
Later in the hospitalization the patient had a fall in his hematocrit from a stable 21 to 17.
He had one guaiac positive stool and was given 2 units of PRBCs.
A large mucous plug was removed, however still with some obstruction of lingula.
The bronch showed some generalized narrowing without focal lesion - possibly related to past lung resection.
He had subsequent CXRs demonstrating improved expansion of his left lung.
# Dysphagia: Following cervical spine surgery, the patient had evidence of dysphagia on bedside and video swallow.
Acute renal failure: Mild creatinine elevation on admission that resolved quickly following admission with some hydration.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Septic hip/prosthesis Epidural abscess Osteomyelitis of foot Lower GI bleed Dysphagia Left lung collapse Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Stable.
The patient is afebrile and his vital signs are stable.
