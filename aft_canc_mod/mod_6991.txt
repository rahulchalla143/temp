Admission Date:  [**2164-10-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-10-22**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2610**] Chief Complaint: respiratory distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: endotracheal intubation  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with history of Afib, HTN, CVA's and severe dementia (nonverbal at baseline), with recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for respiratory failure, discharged two days ago, now presenting from [**Hospital 100**] rehab with respiratory failure.
The patient vomited bilious emesis.
Rehab facility documentation reports patient was having increased amounts of thick, white secretions.
He has been in afib with RVR to the 120s, which improved to the 100s with 3L NS and no rate control.
Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient is afebrile with stable vital signs.
Of note, the patient's recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] featured respiratory failure and multifactorial (cardiogenic and septic) shock, with acute on chronic CHF and multifocal pneumonia.

Sluggish reactivity to light bilaterally, anicteric, MMM, op without lesions, no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, JVP at sternal notch, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly RESP: Bilateral rhonchorous breath sounds with crackles, no wheeze CV: irregularly irregular.
No m/r/g ABD: nd, NABSx4, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly EXT: no c/c/e SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice/no splinters NEURO: AAOx3.
Patchy airspace opacities bilaterally.
Pulmonary edema, aspiration, or pneumonic infiltrates.
Retrocardiac opacity better evaluated on recent chest x-ray.
[**10-16**] CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-10**] through [**10-14**]:  Worsening opacification at the base of the right hemithorax could be due to increasing moderate pleural effusion alone or pleural fluid in association with lower lobe consolidation, a finding that would most readily be explained by aspiration.
No endotracheal tube is seen below C7, the upper margin of this film and there is some tapering of the airway suggesting edema from a recent endotracheal tube.
Left lower lobe opacification is persistent since [**10-14**], another focus of either atelectasis or pneumonia.
Pulmonary vasculature is mildly engorged but there is no edema and mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
[**10-17**] CXR: REASON FOR EXAM: Respiratory distress, status post flash pulmonary edema in setting of A-fib.
Asymmetric opacities in the lungs, right greater than left could be due to asymmetric edema but aspiration is also a possibility.
Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacities have improved consistent with improving atelectasis.
Right lower lobe opacities consistent with atelectasis has increased.
Small bilateral effusions are unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] y/o nonverbal male with afib, CAD, htn, and recent admission for cardiogenic/septic shock [**1-17**] multifocal pneumonia, discharged to rehab on [**10-11**], presenting with worsening respiratory distress leading to intubation in ED.
Palliative care was consulted and met with the brother who insisted on "everything to be done" without intubation.
Given clinical improvement, pt was sent back to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, should continue to hold discussion with brother regarding whether hospice care would be more appropriate in this setting given high potential for multiple readmissions without improvement in prognosis.
After transfer to floor on antibiotics for multifocal pneumonia, he had an episode of respiratory distress with tachypnea and labored breathing, the family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and brother reported that he wanted pt transferred back to the MICU.
CXR most consistent with recurrent multifocal airspace disease or infection (Patient at high risk for aspiration of tube feeds).
Pt had copious secretions which require regular suctioning.
Prior to discharge, his O2 sats were 95% on RA, he was afebrile and no leukocytosis.
His breathing improved after second discharge from MICU and was not labored.
Clinically lungs still sound congested with coarse rhonchi, but no evidence of persistent pneumonia.
# Atrial fibrillation: Tachycardic to 110s on arrival, with improved rate after IVF resuscitation.
No new ischemic changes on ECG.
Possibly exacerbated by severe hypoxia.
He intermittently had RVR requiring IV metoprolol, and his PO dose was uptitrated.
# Frank blood in Foley.
Patient's Foley was irrigated because of poor UOP and revealed frank blood.
