CONCLUSION: Normal brain MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 23166**]e disc disease with disk herniation and cord compression at C4-5.
There is a 16 mm mass apparently arising from the deep lobe of the left parotid, probably a pleomorphic adenoma.
There is a grade 1 anterolisthesis at C4/5.
Multilevel spondylosis is present, as detailed below.
At C3/4, there is a broad-based disc/osteophyte complex, which flattens the [**Last Name (un) **] cord and results in severe [**Last Name (un) **] canal stenosis.
Right uncovertebral joint osteophytes are larger than the left, resulting in severe right and moderate left neural foramen narrowing.
At C4/5, the level of the grade 1 anterolisthesis, there is a broad-based disc/osteophyte complex which compresses the [**Last Name (un) **] cord and results in severe [**Last Name (un) **] canal stenosis.
There is mild narrowing of the right neural foramen and moderate to severe narrowing of the left neural foramen.
The right neural foramen is mildly narrowed.
At C6/7, there is a disc/osteophyte complex, which flattens the anterior [**Last Name (un) **] cord.
Thickening of the ligamentum flavum is also present.
There is severe narrowing of the left neural foramen.
There is subtle high signal in the [**Last Name (un) **] cord from C3/4 through C4/5, which may represent edema or myelomalacia.
No signal abnormalities are identified in the imaged paravertebral soft tissues.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2144-12-16**] 5:37 PM FINDINGS: There have been no significant changes since the previous study.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, or infarction.
There are no diffusion abnormalities.
There is no abnormal enhancement after contrast administration.
Incidentally noted is mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells.
Again noted is a mass either within or immediately posterior and deep to the left parotid gland.
This may represent a pleomorphic adenoma or a seventh nerve schwannoma.
No acute process seen.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2144-12-18**] 1:51 PM CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.
Note is made of bilateral moderate atelectasis and trace pleural effusions.
No clear consolidation.
No definite pulmonary nodules or masses are seen.
Coronary artery calcifications are also noted.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST: Moderate ascites is present.
No focal hepatic mass is seen.
The gallbladder is moderately distended with some gallbladder wall edema, although it is unclear whether this may be secondary to third spacing/NPO status.
The spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys appear unremarkable aside from multiple low- density lesions seen within the left kidney, the largest of which measures approximately 4.5 cm with appearances consistent with cysts, and the smaller ones are too small for accurate characterization, particularly given the motion artifact during the study.
There is diffuse edema within the mesentery and omentum.
Left gastric varices are seen.
No abdominal lymphadenopathy is evident.
Examination of osseous structures does not show lytic or sclerotic lesions concerning for malignancy.
Degenerative changes of the lumbar spine are seen, with a focal scoliosis with an S-shape in the lumbar spine, left convex at L3 and right convex at L4-5, with transitional vertebral body anatomy and slight anterolisthesis of L3 on L4.
Moderately distended gallbladder with mild edema.
This may be secondary to third spacing, given the moderate amount of ascites and mesenteric edema seen.
Moderate bilateral atelectasis.
However, there is no abnormal irregular or rim enhancement, to suggest an abscess in this location.
There is no evidence of epidural abscess.
There is mild compression on the posterior aspect of the cord, C3 level, from the orientation of the ligamentum flavum thickening, which is unchanged.
There is mild narrowing of the size of the cord at the level of C3-C4 which is again unchanged.
Minimal increased signal intensity, at C3-4 level in the cord is unchanged and likely related to edema or encephalomalacia.
Multilevel degenerative changes noted in the intervertebral disc spaces are unchanged.
No pre- or para-vertebral soft tissue swelling or masses are noted.
Postoperative changes noted in the posterior spinous soft tissues with moderate amount of fluid/edema.
No evidence of abscess  3.
No evidence of epidural abscess.
Persistent moderate indentation/compression on the posterior aspect of the [**Last Name (un) **] cord at the level of C3, as seen on the sagittal sequences, not well assessed on the axial sequences due to hardware artifacts.
Multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine, as described above and not significantly changed compared to the prior study.
Linear area of increased signal in the cervical cord at C3-4 likely related to myelomalacia.
Mild enhancement of the dura noted posterior, likely related to post-surgical changes.
No evidence of acute infarct seen.
No signs of hypoxic brain injury are identified on diffusion images.
There is mild prominence of extra-axial spaces with prominence of pachymeninges which is unchanged from previous CT examination of [**2145-1-11**].
Small foci of T2 hyperintensity in the right frontal lobe are nonspecific nature and unchanged from previous study.
There is a left parotid mass identified, which could be due to pleomorphic adenoma and is unchanged from previous study.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormalities or change seen since the previous MRI of [**2144-12-23**] and CT of [**2145-1-11**].
Exam was slightly limited by underlying cervical fusion hardware.
The oral phase demonstrated moderate oral residue with early spillage.
The pharyngeal phase demonstrated vallecular and piriform sinus residue.

There was no aspiration.
IMPRESSION: Several episodes of penetration with thin liquids.
There was no aspiration.
Brief Hospital Course: 63M with a history of ESLD, HCC, HCV, distant alcoholism, bipolar disorder compicated by SI, and medication non-compliance who was admitted on [**2144-12-6**] for gait unsteadiness, tremor, and falls.
In brief, he reported more than a month of increasing gait unsteadiness culminating in falls and more recently tremor and difficult with fine motor tasks.
Just prior to admission he developed gastroenteritis and stopped taking lactulose.
[**Name (NI) **], he was encephalopathic on admission with asterixis and confusion.
Third, he was noted to have [**Name (NI) **] stenosis which was believed to explain some of his symptoms.
His post- op course was complicated by dramatic altered mental status.
On [**2145-1-6**] a code blue was called on the patient for apneic PEA arrest.
He was successfully re-warmed and EEG at that time was consistent with profound encephalopathy.
He underwent bronchoscopy which showed thick, pus-like mucus in the airways which grew out oral flora.
He developed anuric renal failure which was treated with mitodrine, octreotide, albumin, and IVF and ultimately recovered to baseline renal function.
He had a prolonged intubation and is now s/p tracheostomy and successfully extubated.
He had hypernatremia which was treated with free water boluses in his tube feeds and IVF.
He remains on treatment for encephalopathy with both GI decontamination and neuroleptics.
# Hepatic encephalopathy.
w/ marked asterixis on exam on admission.
There was no evidence of infection on admission.
Patient was noted to have significant asterixis and slight attention deficit on exam.
The gait instability and tremor were felt to be possible manifestation of the encephalopathy but did not improve with treatment while his mental status did.
Ultimately this was found to be [**12-21**] [**Month/Day (2) **] cord stenosis (see below) which was treated surgically.
He will continue lactulose 60 mL PO Q4H and titrate to >4BM daily + clear mental status, rifaximin 400 mg PO TID for bowel decontamination, and quetiapine fumarate 50 mg PO Q6H:PRN for agitation per psych as well as standing doses (see below).
He was dischaged on supervised POs with soft solids and thickened liquids.
Notable history of aspiration PNA and mucus plugging which resulted in a PEA arrest (see below).
Weakness / deconditioning.
Likely a combination of deconditioning from being bed-ridden for several weeks, upper motor deficits s/p cervical [**Date Range **] stenosis treated with laminectomy, and catabolic state.
# Tremor/Gait instability.
Initially improved slightly with lactulose, suggesting hepatic encephalopathy as a contributor, but Pt continued to have severe clonus and tremors as well as worsening gait instability.
MRI of spine showed extensive [**Month/Day (2) **] cord compression w/ myelomalacia at C3 to C7 levels.
Neurology was consulted who felt patient's gait instability and and clonus were most likely due to chronic [**Month/Day (2) **] cord compression at these levels.
On [**12-9**], patient was noted to have worsening gait difficulties and more pronouced clonus.
On [**12-11**] patient underwent posterior cervical laminotomy C3 to T1 and posterior cervical instrumentation C3-T1, posterior cervical thoracic arthrodesis C3-T1, autograft and allograft augmentation for fusion.
The post operative course complicated by severe encephalopathy and NMS (see below).
# NMS and Post-op encephalopathy: Pt.
undergone C3-T1 laminectomy, instrumentation and [**Month/Year (2) **] fusion on [**2144-12-11**] and was delerious post operatively w/ decompensation of hepatic encephalopathy.
continued to be unresponsive w/ low grade temperatures despite  marginal improvement w/ haldol (>40mg) and lactulose.
Developed tachypnea, hypertension, tachycardia and low grade temps.
CK > 1400, but pt had been w/ persistent thrashing for ~ 1wk.
Psych recommended switch to Seroquel for agitation and bipolar.
# Bipolar d/o.
Patient was euthymic on admission until the time of surgery with no sx of mania or depression.
Pt reported recent auditory halucinations.
This can be decreased as needed for sedation.
Cirrhosis: History of HCV and distant alcohol abuse.
Plan is to continue management of encephalopathy with lactulose and rifamixin.
# Left parotid mass.
MICU Course: # Cardiac / PEA arrest / hemodynamics: On [**1-7**] the patient had a witnessed PEA arrest.
A large mucous plug was suctioned from the ET tube, with subsequent restoration of perfusing rhythm and the patient was transfered to the medical ICU for further managment.
Early in the morning of [**1-8**] the patient became hypotensive, received several IV fluid boluses, and eventually required levophed to support his blood pressure.
Echo was hyperdynamic without evidence of cardiogenic shock.
On [**1-11**], peri-intubation, the patient had an episode of AF with RVR and aberrancy that responded to Ca2+.
# Respiratory/Ventilation: On transfer to the MICU the patient had a bronchoscopy  showing thick, yellow secretions concerning for infection, and was started vancomycin and zosyn for a 5 day course for hospital acquired pneumonia.
The patient was successfully extubated on the morning of [**1-10**], but was reintubated on [**1-11**] secondary to respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions.
Placement was complicated by some minor bleeding for which ENT was consulted and evaluated the patient.
# Mental Status: The patient had an altered mental status for most of his MICU stay.
Initially this was felt to be secondary to both cirrhosis and PEA arrest (and anoxic brain injury to unknown extent) contributing.
The patient had an EEG after his PEA arrest that showed a severe encephalopathy.
An MRI on [**1-16**] head showed no evidence of anoxic brain injury.
The patient had multiple episdoes of agitation and multiple medications were tried.
# Renal Failure: Post cardiac arrest the patient was anuric.
This etiology was likely combination of acute tubular necrosis in the setting of PEA arrest and  hepatorenal syndrome.
# Hypernatremia: Likely hypovolemic hypernatremia in the setting of recent ATN and current HRS.
Hypernatremia worsened again with acceleration of tube feeds and improved with increased free water boluses and holding of tube feeds due to the patient's inability to maintain an upright posture.
# Thrombocytopenia: The patient had a low platelet count that was stable.
Initial considerations were HIT vs. splenic sequestration.
Smear on [**1-14**] showed no evidence of DIC.
# Cirrhosis: Hep C stable.
Quetiapine 100 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Tablet PO QAM (once a day (in the morning)) as needed for agitation.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization [**Month/Day (2) **]: One (1) treatment Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
