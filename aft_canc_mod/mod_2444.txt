She was admitted to [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital for evaluation, found to have dilated intrahepatic ducts on u/s, was referred to [**Hospital **] clinic at [**Hospital1 18**] and sent in for further evaluation.
Notes poor po intake x 3 weeks with 10 lb wt loss over 1 month.
Denies depressed mood or agitation.
Does have decreased energy with some lightheadedness with position changes for which her lasix was stopped on [**5-21**] and salt tablets were added.

Marked right and left intrahepatic biliary dilatation extending to the central ends of the segmental branches in the left lobe and central ends of the anterior and posterior division of the right biliary tree with an ill defined mass in the porta-hepatitis measuring up to 5.5cm TRN x 3.4cm AP.
Appearances are most consistent with a Klatskin- type cholangiocarcinoma which does not appear amenable to resection given the involvement of all the right and left main biliary ducts.
Mildly enlarged lymph node in the anterior periportal region measuring up to 1.9 cm may represent [**Known lastname 21336**] local adenopathy but no distant metastatic disese demonstrated.
Several small (subcentimeter) pancreatic cystic lesions (cysts versus side branch IPMT).
Small amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
Hiatus hernia and moderate colonic diverticulosis .
ECG [**5-23**]: Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response.
Diffuse low voltage.
T wave inversions in leads V1-V2 suggestive of anteroseptal ischemia.
No previous tracing available for comparison.

# Painless jaundice: MRCP was ordered to evaluate ductal system.
It revealed ductal dilation and enhancement suggestive of cholangiocarinoma, without obvious metastasis but not amenable to resection.
She developed GI bleeding in setting of supratherapeutic PTT requiring 3U PRBC transfusion and monitoring in the ICU.
Plan was initially for ERCP to look for a source of bleeding as well as to stent her biliary obstruction.
After family meeting on [**5-30**] goals of care were changed to palliation and since she had no further GI bleeding or pain with stable bilirubin, it was decided that should would have the ERCP and stent placement in the future if she developed any symptoms which can be arranged required no pain medication when in hospital but they can likely .
# AF on coumadin: This was rate controlled without any agents throughout admission.
Coumadin was held due to supratherapeutic INR and need for interventions.
She remained supratherapeutic with elevated PT and PTTs after vitamin K orally.
She had the UGIB as describe above so the decision was made to hold her coumadin and aspirin indefinitely due to risk of GI bleeding.
She should continue on protonix twice a day since there was no clear source of GI bleeding.
Her INR was 1.5 and PTT was in the 70s from subcutaneous heparin administration for DVT prevention.
NG lavage revealed bright red blood and clots.
# Hypotension: Patients blood pressure was noted to be lower 90-110s/60s after admission without signs of cardiac dysfunction or infection.
Her lisinopril was held with good effect but restarted along with lasix due to symptoms of volume overload.
# CAD: presumed stable ECG with evidence of previous ischemia, patient had no pain, she but asprin was stopped due to GI bleed.
# Metabolic acidosis without gap: Due to saline IVF, once these were stopped, bicarb levels improved.
# Hyponatremia: Initially thought to be due to hypovolemia, then found consistent with SIADH.
She was placed on a free water restriction 750 cc daily, sodium was monitored and increased appropriately.
She never had evidence of mental status changes with levels as low as 124.
Chest xrays were checked for potential lung malignancy or infection as the cause and none were found.
