Laparoscopic jejunostomy.
Therapeutic bronchoscopy.
Buttressing of intrathoracic anastomosis with thymic fat    pad.
History of Present Illness: 46M with long segment Barrett's esophagus and biopsies this year that indicated intramucosal adenocarcinoma.
A PET scan on [**2147-11-8**] showed no distant FDG uptake but mild FDG avidity in the distal esophagus with a small area of nodularity.
Given the patient's young age and excellent health he is being admitted for [**Date Range 12351**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] minimal invasive esophagectomy.
Chest: VATS sites right lateral chest healing without redness purulence nor drainage.
Pertinent Results: [**2147-12-25**] Esophagus study:  no evidence of leak or holdup  [**2147-12-23**] Chest & Abdominal CT IMPRESSION: 1.
No definite evidence of leak.
Ground-grass opacity of the right upper and lower lobes is likely post-operative edmea and hypoinflation atelectasis, although aspiration and developing infection cannot be excluded.
Abnormal low density of the left hepatic lobe is likely post-operative edema ad the portal and hepatic veins and proximal left hepatic artery appear patent, but evolving ischemia can not be excluded.
On the right, there is a millimetric focal pleural air inclusion limited to the very apex.
No evidence of tension.
Status post esophagectomy with neoesophagus along the right mediastinum and mediastinal drain.
Bibasilar plate-like atelectasis without evidence of effusions or fluid overload.
Laparoscopic jejunostomy.
Buttressing of intrathoracic anastomosis with thymic fat pad.
NGT remained until POD3  Nutrition: J-tube feeds: Replete tube feeds were started on POD1 and slowly titrated to Goal 100 Ml/hr on POD  Esophagus study was performed on [**12-25**] which showed no anastomic leak.
ID: On POD2 he spiked fevers to 101.  he was pan cultured with no growth.
Abdominal CT done [**12-23**] performed and negative for anastomic leak.
But Abnormal low density of the left hepatic lobe is likely post-operative edema ad the portal and hepatic veins and proximal left hepatic artery appear patent, but evolving ischemia can not be excluded.
He had no further fevers.
The chest tube site required a U suture for moderate drainage which will be removed during his f/u visit.
Replete Full Strength Goal Rate 100 mL/hr Cycle 1500-0900  Flush 100 mL before and after tube feeds   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Diversified VNA and hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: Esophageal cancer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: Call Dr.[**Name (NI) 5067**] office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2348**] if experience: -Fever > 101 or chills -Increased shortness of breath, cough or sputum production -Difficulty or painful swallowing.
Diarrhea -Incision develops drainage -Chest tube site, JP site cover with a bandaid until healed -Nothing in Feeding tube unless it is in liquid form.
-Call immediately if J-tube falls out or suture comes loose   Followup Instructions: Follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**0-0-**] Date/Time:[**2148-1-9**] 10:00am on the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Center [**Location (un) 24**].
