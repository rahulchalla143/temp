#  Low Back/Buttock Pain:  On initial exam, pain was very focused over left buttock and low back and she denied any radiation of her pain.
She was started on a llidocaine patch, tylenol 650mg q6h, tramadol 50mg q6h prn, and morphine 0.5-1mg IV prn for breakthrough pain.
She continued to have tenderness to palpation over left buttock with some radiation to upper thigh.
Pain in that location was reproduced with SLR and crossed SLR, but the pain did not radiate below the upper thigh.
Due to hypotension and decreased mental status (see below) pt.
She improved and in discussion with attending, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on the morning of [**2192-9-5**],  Ultram was stopped and ibuprofen was started despite risk of bleeding due to the fact that the benefits outweighed the risk (her GI bleed was many years ago and because she has been on PPIs it was felt that she could tolerate NSAIDS).
Her pain became tolerable.
had poorly controlled HTN on last admission which was thought to be part of the cause for her chest pain at that time.
Differential at that time included narcotic side effects (thought to be most likely), bleed - has known AAA - but patient denied any abdominal pain at the time of exam, CVA, seizure.
As above, her hypotension was thought to be related to pain medication and all narcotics were stopped, including Ultram.
# Right Elbow Medial Epicondylitis:  Pt.
began to complain about some right elbow pain that was consistent with medial epicondylitis.
There was no trauma, no tenderness over the olecranon, but did have pain with active wrist flexion against resistance.
was kept on regimen for pain as above and this pain was improved on the day of discharge.
has history of COPD with liekly poor compliance with home nebulizers.
She did not complain of any SOB and her home regimen of nebulizers (albuterol and budesonide TID) was continued.
# History of gastric/duodenal ulcers that required an ICU admission in the past, intubation, trach.
Initially NSAIDS were avoided during this hospitalization, but due to the patient's poor response to narcotic pain meds (hypotension and AMS) and the remote history of her GI bleed, it ws decided that she could start NSAIDS.
has a BM q2-3 days at baseline, however she has not had a BM in approximately 4 days - likely an effect of her pain medication and decreased mobility.
She does not want to be intubated or rescuscitated.
