Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: [**2140**]: Diagnosed with malignant melanoma of right shoulder, negative sentinel lymph node biopsy [**2144**]: Diagnosed with met melanoma and underwent BCT [**5-27**] with cisplatin, dacarbazine, vinblastine and IL-2 with disease progression noted [**9-26**] - enrolled in MDX-010 trial [**11-26**]: Received last treatment [**5-28**]: CT-evidence of disease progression with enlarging right paratracheal and retrocaval nodes.
CT on [**7-5**] showed slight increase in size of right paratracheal node.
[**2146-9-7**]: Completed 3 treatments of MDX-010 [**11-27**]: CT showed minimal interval progression [**2147-3-8**]: CT showed interval disease progression in the form of retrocaval node enlargement in the upper abdomen.
[**6-/2147**]: CT Torso -minimal change with no evidence of new metastatic focus.
[**12/2147**]:  Found to have autoimmune hypophysitis secondary to Ipilimumab (CTLA-4 antibody).
However, was found not to have specific BRAF mutation.
[**2148-3-27**]: Started the Phase I RAF 265 clinical trial with dose reduction x 2 for nausea and vomiting and neuropathy.
Therapy was held on [**2149-2-5**] due to atrial flutter (unrelated to study drug) requiring cardiac ablation and could not be restarted after previous two dose reductions.

EKG: Sinus tachycardia to 142.
Sub-mm ST depression in V5/V6.
IMAGING: [**2149-3-7**] CXR: Large right paratracheal and right perihilar masses compatible with known metastatic disease.
No focal consolidations to suggest pneumonia.
No free air under the diaphragms.
The distal appendix is borderline enlarged, measuring 7.5 mm, demonstrates no intraluminal air, and there is equivocal periappendiceal fat stranding.
Hepatic steatosis.
Brief Hospital Course: 53 year old woman with metastatic melanoma, adrenal insufficiency, and NIDDM presenting with 3d of nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain found to have sinus tachycardia and severe headache.
# Tachycardia: Review of recent outpatient vital signs suggests patient's baseline HR usually in the 90s-110s.
With recent poor PO intake, her additional tachycardia is likely related to hypovolemia in the setting of her GI illness.
History of nausea and vomiting suggests that she might not have been getting her metoprolol which is also likely contributing.
Although the patient does have an underlying malignancy and is thus at a higher risk for PE, there is no indication for CTA at this time since the tachycardia has resolved.
# Headache: Patient had a severe bilateral headache upon presentation which improved with rest, hydration, and small amounts of dilaudid.
# Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Likely secondary to a viral gastroenteritis considering sick contacts and symptomatic improvement.
No new meds.
CT abdomen/pelvis negative for appendicitis or other acute pathology.
The patient's symptoms have resolved and she is tolerating a regular diet.
# Chest Discomfort: Notably worsened with food/drinking.
Felt secondary to acute worsening of GERD due to significant vomiting worsening esophageal acidity and inability to keep down her H2 blocker.
Cardiac enzymes negative and ekg w/o ischemic changes.
Improved with improvement of vomiting and H2 blocker.
# U/A: Suggestive of UTI so patient was given a dose of ciprofloxacin in the ED.
Urine culture grew 10,000 to 100,000 CFU of alpha-hemolytic strep.
# Adrenal insufficiency: Continued home prednisone 6mg daily.
# HTN: Continued metoprolol.
# Diabetes type 2: A1c: 11.4%.
Patient has never been treated for diabetes before.
Provided extensive diabetic teaching and instruction on Lantus use as she was sent home on 18 units of lantus daily.
