Admission Date:  [**2185-10-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2185-11-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2124-5-5**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**Hospital Ward Name **] ICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an addendum to discharge summary dated [**2185-11-5**] for [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7990**], a 61 year-old female with chronic lung and liver disease who presented with acute adult respiratory distress syndrome after total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
A chest x-ray [**11-11**] showed persistence of both pulmonary edema and left retrocardiac opacity.
Aggressive diuresis continued.
Cardiovascular:  The patient had hypotension earlier on admission as detailed on prior note.
She continued on Hydrocortisone and Fluticasone for relative adrenal insufficiency through [**11-8**].
However, after corticosteroids were stopped, her pressure became mildly low requiring intravenous Vasopressors.
On this regimen the patient was no longer hypotensive and all pressors were discontinued on [**11-9**] and hs not been started since.
The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response requiring a Digoxin load earlier in the admission.
She remained rather tachycardic and level was checked after several days and found to be 0.4.
She continued to have intermittent fevers and leukocytosis.
On [**11-9**] abdominal CT showed ascites, but no obvious infection.
Temperature was 100.8 on [**11-13**], a urinalysis, chest x-ray and diagnostic paracentesis were unremarkable for infection.
On [**11-15**] gram positive coxae grew in one of four blood culture bottles and this happened again in one of four bottles on [**11-18**] as well as gram positive coxae growing from the tip of the arterial line discontinued on [**11-13**].
If the patient continues to have low grade fevers and leukocytosis repeat surveillance blood cultures should be checked next week.
At present the patient has been afebrile for several days, but continues to have a moderate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18 to 22.
However, there was no sign of active infection.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient is known to have cirrhosis diagnosed from an abdominal CT demonstrating nodular liver edge and ascites.
She has never had signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, encephalopathy or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
It is unclear whether her ascites was due solely to fluid overload from hospitalization or due to persistent liver disease.
Her fluid status will need to be reevaluated on a regular basis to determine her long term need for this diuretic therapy.
The patient has also received multiple doses of subcutaneous vitamin K for elevated INR on this admission.
Hematologic:  The patient has a stable hematocrit slightly above 30 and has had no active hematologic issues other then the coagulopathy and leukocytosis described above.
Endocrine:  The patient has been noted to have hyperglycemia on this admission.
It is not clear how much of this is due to corticosteroid therapy (now discontinued) and how much is due to underlying diabetes mellitus.
We are currently titrating up the patient's NPH insulin to cover hypoglycemia caused by nocturnal tube feeds.
She is beginning to exhibit signs of anxiety and/or sundowning and has been started on Sertraline 50 mg po q day with prn Zolpidem.
Further therapy for anxiety and insomnia should be considered based on the patient's clinical presentation.
This resulted in multiple electrolyte abnormalities including hypokalemia requiring aggressive potassium repletion as well as Acetazolamide for severe metabolic alkalosis and Spironolactone.
In addition, the patient developed hypernatremia requiring several liters per day of free water repletion.
In the last several days the patient has become hyponatremic with a serum sodium of approximately 130.
Nutrition:  The patient tolerated a blue dye swallowing study without aspiration on [**11-18**].
In addition a oropharyngeal swallow showed only mild dysphagia with no aspiration.
Prophylaxis:  The patient should receive Coumadin with monitoring of international normalized ratio for both deep venous thrombosis and atrial fibrillation prophylaxis.
Pelvic mass status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy showing only benign pathology.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Chronic liver disease secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C. 4.
Resolving adult respiratory distress syndrome.
Low back pain.
Mitral valve prolapse.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Relative adrenal insufficiency.
Anemia of chronic disease.
Ventilator associated pneumonia resolved.
Glucose intolerance.
