CXR [**2192-8-25**] Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction.
There is slight interval decrease in the right pleural effusion as compared to [**2192-8-10**].
There are no new focal consolidations worrisome for infectious process.
There is no evidence of failure.
Moderate baseline artifact.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Small LV cavity size with moderate symmetric LVH and hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
Consequently, there is an intra-cavitary gradient which likely occurs at the mid-ventricular level.. Mildly thickened mitral and aortic valves without significant stenosis or regurgitation.
Moderate right pleural effusion, and small left pleural effusion, and bibasilar atelectasis, worse on the right.
Bilateral prominent axillary lymph nodes, and prominent hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes.
Splenic hypodensities concerning for splenic lymphoma involvement, or splenic infarct.
Large lymph nodes in periportal area.
Multiple prominent lymph nodes in mesentery and retroperitoneum and along pancreas and splenic hilum.
Bilateral prominent lymph nodes in inguinal and groin area.
Right groin fluid collection, could be evolving hematoma, seroma, or lypmhocele.
Correlate if history of recent biopsy/intervention in area.
Diffusely increased hepatic echogenicity with multiple hypoechoic masses scattered throughout the liver.
This appearance is highly suspicious for malignancy.
Multiple enlarged periportal lymph nodes as described.
Mild splenomegaly.
Please note that a large left abdominal mass mentioned in the history was not identified with ultrasound and further evaluation could be obtained with CT if clinically indicated.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilation.
Small right pleural effusion.
There is slight interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions in the interim.
Mediastinal widening in particular along the right paratracheal area at the level of the azygos vein as well as at the aortopulmonic window is unchanged and most likely consistent with diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma.
Brief Hospital Course: # Diffuse B-cell lymphoma: Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 11752**] was admitted with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
A CT of his torso to evaluate the burden of his disease revelaed extensive para-aortic and hilar lymphadenopathy and intrahepatic involvement.
Rituxan was initiated on [**8-14**] to decrease his tumor burden and was repeated on [**8-17**].
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 87096**] tolerated the therapy well, he was treated with 5 days of high dose steroids after chemotherapy and experienced a slight increase in LFTs likely as a result of the therapy.
As Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 87096**] was clinically stable, it was decided to discharge him to home with regular follow-up for evaluation for future care.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Mr. [**Initials (NamePattern4) 87096**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] was likely prerenal.
He was transferred to the ICU briefly after admission secondary to tachypnea likely from metabolic acidosis.
# Hepatic failure: He was noted to have elevated liver enzymes with LDH of 2400 and T. Bili of 24.0 on admission.
His cholestatic liver disease began to improve on HD 6.
# Urinary Tract Infection:  Mr. [**Known lastname 16968**] began to develop symptoms of dysuria on HD 5.
A urine culture grew coagulase negative staph aureas and Mr. [**Known lastname 16968**] was started on PO ciprofloxacin.
Evidence of bowel edema and mild ascities on CT.
# Right Inguinal Node Biopsy Site:  Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 87096**] developed poor wound healing at the site of his lymph node biopsy at an OSH.
Evidence of a hematoma or seroma was visualized on CT.  General Surgery was consulted to examine the wound, antibiotic therapy was deferred and wet to dry dressing was applied three times a day.
Wound culture grew MRSA, he was treated for several days with IV Daptomycin, as Mr. [**Known lastname 16968**] reportedly has a vancomycin allergy,  which was discontinued as the culture appeared more consistent with a contaminant.
Outpatient Physical Therapy 67 year old gentleman with new diagnosis large B cell lymphoma with de-conditioning after a long hospital stay.
Large B Cell Lymphoma  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for initiation of treatment of Large B Cell Lymphoma.
You also developed a wound at the site of your lymph node biopsy.
They treated the wound with a vacuum and eventually wet-to-dry dressing.
You were started on several medications during your hospital stay, that people with lymphoma often take during treatment.
