Admission Date:  [**2124-3-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2124-4-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2084-3-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**] Chief Complaint: fever, chills, night sweats  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known firstname 1692**] [**Known lastname 21648**] is a 39 year old gentleman with history of CML in undifferentiated blast crisis.
Mr. [**Known lastname 21648**] had recurrence recently after being in remission for 3.5 years.
He is s/p 4 doses of radiation therapy to a painful lytic lesion in his cervical spine.
For the past few days patient has had a low grade fever (100.4 at home) along with some chills, night sweats, and a new cough.
He has also been vomiting x 1 day with decreased po intake.
Past Medical History: CML in undifferentiated blast crisis DM2 Hypertension  Social History: lives with wife at home.
Family History: N/C  Physical Exam: T 101.5 BP 125/78 P 125 O2 97% RA GENERAL:  In no acute distress.
No sinus tenderness, lesion at tip of tongue, moderate mucositis Moderately tender in right subscapular region- area of previous biopsy, also mildly tender in L shoulder, increased range of motion, no meningeal signs.
NECK:  No cervical, supraclavicular, or occipital adenopathy, no axillary adenopathy.
No murmurs, rubs, thrills, or gallops.
ABDOMEN:  Nontender without hepatosplenomegaly, no inguinal adenopathy.
EXTREMITIES:  No focal bony tenderness.
SKIN:  No cutaneous lesions.
[**3-14**] Bone Marrow: Chronic Myelogenous leukemia in blast phase (Acute Myelogenous Leukemia) .
Radiology: [**3-17**] CXR: Note is made of widened superior mediastinum, which can be due to projection, however, can represent mediastinal lymphadenopathy in this patient with blastic crisis.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**3-22**] CT C-spine: There is a large infiltrating paraspinal mass extending at least from the C3 level through T2, and may extend even more inferiorly.
No penetration of the thecal sac, but some evidence of osseous erosion of C3 through C6 spinous processes.
There is also a left skull base soft tissue mass.
Sinus opacification and general subcutaneous lymphedema.
2) Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Multifocal areas of atelectasis within the right lung and additional tiny area of focal patchy opacity in the right lung, nonspecific.
3) Two tiny nodular opacities within the left upper lobe.
4) Fracture of the right eighth rib, healing.
Additional possible old trauma of the left fifth rib.
5) Trace coronary artery calcifications.
[**3-29**] right upper extremity ultrasound: UPPER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND WITH DOPPLER: No prior studies are available for comparison.
There is occlusive thrombus involving the entire cephalic vein.
There is no DVT.
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with a cephalic vein thrombophlebitis.
[**3-29**] CT head: IMPRESSION: 1) No acute hemorrhage, mass effect, or cerebral edema.
2) Likely leptomeningeal or parenchymal 3-mm metastatic lesion in the right temporal lobe.
3) Moderately enhancing soft tissue mass in the left petroclival region with associated bone destruction, which abuts the dura adjacent to the left pons and medulla without mass effect on the pons or medulla.
4) Stable paranasal sinus and mastoid air cell disease.
On [**4-15**] pt was started on Neupogen for persistent neutropenia 2 weeks after completion of chemotherapy.
##Fever- Initially thought it was secondary to blast crisis.
Also, thought possibly secondary to mouth source, since he had mucositis and a tongue lesion.
Therefore, he was started on 1 gram cefepime and flagyl for anaerobic coverage.
C spine CT showed large infiltrating paraspinal mass from C3 to T2 and left skull base soft tissue mass.
Question of tumor fever vs. drug fever.
CT sinus showed sinus opacification: fungal infx vs. tumor.
Fungal swab pending RUE U/S showed thrombophlebitis, but no DVT.
On [**4-3**], pt became septic w/ GNR bacteremia.
Found to have ESBL E coli bacteremia sensi to gent, meropenum, imipenum, tobra; gent discontinued on [**4-6**].
Most likely source of bacteremia is rectal mucositis and rectal fissures, with associated rectal cellulitis.
##Anal fissure: Likely source of GNR sepsis.
[**Last Name (un) **] baths, stool softeners, pain control.
##Chloroma Pain- Initially had severe pain, likely from chloroma.
Morphine pca was started for pain control and a CT cspine was done due to increased pain requirements.
CT showed increased size of right paraspinal mass and base of skull lesion.
Patient was treated with chemo and pain medications.
Chloroma pain resolved.
On [**3-29**], pt developed acute mental status change and received a course of whole brain radiation.
##Neuro/MS change: Pt has soft tissue mass with associated bone destruction in area of L clivus and petrous bone [**2-2**] lymphoma.
This was followed by significant mental status change with aggitation, confusion, tongue deviation (L) on neuro exam.
Pt had stat head CT which showed new 3mm right temporal lobe mass, but no change in L clivopetrous region.
Pt had urgent whole brain radiation, and completed course of xrt.
Pt was discharged on low dose glargine to help control BS in setting of steroid taper.
On [**4-3**] got FFP for line placement and became tachycardic, tachypnic and febrile.
Needs pre-medication for all blood products.
Pramoxine-Mineral Oil-Zinc 1-12.5 % Ointment Sig: One (1) Appl Rectal Q4 H PRN () as needed for rectal pain.
