Left lower lobe linear atelectasis.
[**2183-1-13**] EKG: v-paced at 69 beats per minute, left axis, ST depressions in I and avL, (no comparisons) .
CT chest: IMPRESSION: 1) 8.0cm right lower lobe mass or abscess.
Although the associated small to moderate pleural effusion is mobile, the presence of pleural thickening both close to and remote from the mass as well as extensive mediastinal adenopathy and a 1 cm left adrenal nodule are suggestive of malignant spread.
2) Moderate to severe emphysema.
3) Severe atherosclerosis, coronary, aortic and abdominal.
4) Chronic cholelithiasis.
5) Small, hypervascular left renal lesion.
6) Interatrial lipoma.
CT Chest FNA: IMPRESSION: Successful CT guided FNA of right lower lobe mass.
Core needle biopsy was not performed at this time due to the patient's recent aspirin use and elevated INR.
FNA lung mass:  POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS   Consistent with poorly differentiated, non-small cell   carcinoma with sarcomatoid features.
No immunoreactivity is seen for S-100 or HMB-45.
CXR PA and Lat: Right lower lobe lung mass status post biopsy.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: # GIB: appears lower and secondary to supratherapeutic INR.
Plan for no scope at this time.
# Supratherapeutic INR: likely due to poor po intake in setting of being on coumadin.
No further coumadin.
# Lung Mass: Found to have RLL mass on CXR which was confirmed on CT with malignant appearance.
CT guided FNA revealed poorly diff NSCLC.
Oncology was consulted and recommended outpatient staging PET/CT (which was scheduled on [**2183-2-3**]) and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on the 11th in oncology clinic for possible palliative chemotherapy if he is interested in this.
