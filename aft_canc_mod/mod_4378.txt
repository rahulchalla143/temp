[**12-2**]+ symmetrical edema.
For serious infections, repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted if third generation cephalosporins were used.
New right-sided notable renal pelvic fullness with hydroureter extending to the pelvis.
Area of high attenuation at transition point, is concerning for obstruction possibly due to metastases, although noncontrast studies are not available to evaluate for possibility of a previously unidentified ureteral calculi (less likely).
Stomach wall thickening with ulceration noted in greater curvature, may be malignant in nature.
Given dramatic weight loss in the last year, the patient is at increase risk of SMA syndrome or a functional obstruction.
New 1cm hypoattenuation in right hepatic lobe concerning for malignancy.
Increased size of left pleural effusion with worsening lobar collapse.
MRI lumbar spine [**2199-3-13**] Widespread metastatic infiltrative bone disease involving the lumbar spine, sacrum, and visualized lower T11 and 12 vertebral bodies without evidence of thecal compression or neural compromise.
Mild anterior wedge compression of the L1 vertebral body.
Moderate right pleural effusion is slightly decreased.
Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
Unchanged minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
EGD [**2199-3-19**]: Impression: Esophagitis at the GE junction Gastritis with edema and thickened gastric folds suggesting extrinsic compression but cannot exclude tumor infiltration (biopsy) Duodenitis of the bulb and 2nd part of the duodenum Deformity due to extrinsic compression of the duodenal bulb and second part of the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: The findings account for the symptoms Await pathology results Extrinsic compression at the duodenum is not amenable to duodenal stenting Further management per inpatient team   Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo M with Stage IV Gallbladder CA diagnosed in [**1-10**] most recently treated with FOLFIRI (cycle 4 on [**2199-2-13**]) who presented to ED with fever to 103, weakness, and hypotension .
# Hypotension: On admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient was hypotensive to 91/60 and was on his 5th liter of IVNS.
Hypotension is attributed to hypovolemia from vomiting and poor oral intake in addition to gram negative sepsis, and resolved prior to transfer to the oncology medicine floor.
Patient was treated empirically with meropenem and vancomycin for presumed intrabdominal source of infection related to bacterial translocation from small bowel obsruction.
Other sources considered were pneumonia, urinary given hydronephrosis on imaging, biliary with hx of biliary sepsis in [**1-11**] and obstruction of biliary drain.
# Incomplete small bowel obstruction.
CT abdomen on arrival was concerning for SMA syndrome vs obstruction related to metastatic disease vs functional obstruction.
A nasogastric tube was placed with large volume of bileous fluid returned and improvement in symptoms.
He was identified as high risk for surgical intervention given comorbid metastatic gall bladder cancer and the location of the transition point close to the stomach limiting surgical approach.
The NGT was clamped to monitor progoression of symptoms and the patient shortly developed nausea and abdominal pain and NGT was returned to suction.
Biopsies were taken that showed gastric mucosa with inflammation.
He was sent home on hospice with an NGT, with a suction device and VNA bridge to hospice for management.
Because of NGT, patient is unable to take pills, so his medications were transitioned to liquid or dissolving at dispo.
# Transaminitis: LFTs and t.bili were mildly elevated on admission and fluctuated throughout ICU course.
Prior CT revealed obstructed metallic stent.
He did not endorse RUQ pain to suggest cholangiitis.
# Back pain: Patient complained of worsening lower back pain and new fecal incontinence and urinary hesitancy concerning for spinal cord compression particularly in light of known metastatic involvment of lumbar spine.
He was taken for MRI of lumbar spine which revealed progression of metastatic disease; however no spinal cord compression or evidence of cauda equina syndrome.
# Left lobe collapse and effusion: On admission, CXR was notible for left > right pleural effusions which are known to be metastatic and worsened since recent thoracentesis [**2-28**].
# Right renal hydronephrosis: Admission CT abdomen showed right hydronephrosis without stone related to ureter compression from mass.
# DVT: Diagnosed [**2-28**] with right common femoral, superficial femoral, and profunda femoral veins, with patency of the popliteal and tibial veins.
Patient was placed on heparin drip in anticipation of pulmonary and possible gastrointestinal proceedures.
# Gall bladder cancer: Stage IV with mets to peritoneum and bone.
# Elevated INR: Related to poor nutrition and hepatic synthetic dysfunction.
# Anemia:  related to chronic disease, HCT was stable throughout hospital stay.
# Stage II superficial areas of breakdown on buttocks: [**Name6 (MD) **] wound RN  we continued  supportive care .
# Code: DNR/DNI   Medications on Admission: BACLOFEN - 10 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth every 4 hours ; may gradually decrease frequency if hiccups resolve or if there  is bothersome dizziness/drowsiness LORAZEPAM - 0.5 mg Tablet - One - Two Tablet(s) by mouth Every 4-6 hours as needed for nausea METOCLOPRAMIDE - 10 mg Tablet - One Tablet(s) by mouth Three times per day.
