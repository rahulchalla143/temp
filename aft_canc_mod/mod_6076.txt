Lipase found to be 1100, admitted, made NPO, treated conservatively for presumed pancreatitis * 7 days ago, several episodes of bilious emesis that stopped 6 days ago; also had dizziness and syncope * over the past 3 days, has been febrile to Tmax of 103F * yesterday, asked Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to facilitate transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]; arrived in ED.
Eventually, he underwent a CT scan which showed a large splenic lesion concerning for bleed.
He received about 2.5 liters of fluid and vanco/levoflox/flagyl.
A repeat Hct showed a drop from 32.3 -> 27.2.
Past Medical History: PMH: recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis, about 22 in all .
Family History: FH: Father died of brain cancer at age 52; mother alive and well at 60.
Physical Exam:      98.9 110 143/95 16 96RA Gen: elderly male, appears younger than stated age, NAD, diaphorectic, +scleral icterus, dyspneic HEENT: NC/AT, EOMI, PERRLA bilat., MMM, without cervical LAD on my exam Cor: RRR without m/g/r, no JVD, no bruits Lungs: CTA bilat.
[**Last Name (un) **]: +BS, soft, no masses, palpable reducible ventral/umbilical hernia, distended without tympany, ++tender at LUQ with guarding, tender at L flank and LLQ, mild percussion tenderness, no rebound Ext: warm feet, no edema   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2159-5-2**] and again on [**2159-5-9**].
His hospital course will be outlined in a system format below:  Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient's pain was managed via a PCA.
He reported that his pain was well controlled.
On POD [**4-22**], the patient started c/o increasing abdominal pain.
He became febrile and tachycardic.
In addition he became acutely delirous resulting in a code purple.
Psychiatry was consulted for acute agitation.
It was discovered that the patient had a enteric leak causing the agitation.
After being re-operated on, the patient did not have further episodes of agitation or confusion.
His pain was once again managed on a PCA and eventually transitioned to PO pain medications.
However on POD [**4-22**], the patient became tachycardic [**12-18**] enteric leak.
After the second operation, the patient did not have futher episodes of tachycardia.
On POD 4, the patient had acute respiratory distress requiring admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
W/U was negative for LE DVT but POSITIVE for left upper lobe subsegmental PEs and a large left pleural effusion.
The effusion was seen pre-operatively, likely [**12-18**] to his pancreatitis, thus the decision was made not to perform a thoracocentesis.
Post-procedure CXR shows a small loculated PTX and the CT was placed on wall suction.
He has no respiratory issues.
and IV contrast showed a large hypodense mass within the spleen with blood tracking posterior to the spleen and into the pelvis.
Findings were consistent with a subcapsular hematoma of the spleen which had ruptured.
He was taken to IR for urgent embolization and then taken to the OR for a hematoma evacuation and distal pancreatectomy and total splenectomy.
His post-operatively course was c/b a leak for which he was taken back to the OR on POD 7.
A large leak seen on the Roux Limb was identified.
Post-operatively the patient required IR drainage of a fluid collection adjacent/at the site of surgery.
On POD 19/12, the patient started on a regular diet to see if there was a pancreatic leak of some sort.
There did not appear to be an increase in drain output.
His foley was eventually discontinued and he voided without difficulties.
In addition OR cultures were also obtained.
The only positive blood culture was on [**2159-5-8**] 1/2 bottles for STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.
Cultures intraop as well as from the abdominal drains grew out HAEMOPHILUS SPECIES NOT INFLUENZAE (HEAVY GROWTH, repeat culture shows sparse growth), [**Female First Name (un) **] ALBICANS (SPARSE GROWTH), and LACTOBACILLUS SPECIES (RARE GROWTH).
He was afebrile > 48 hours and his post-splenectomy vaccines were administered on [**2159-5-20**].
His diet was advanced to regular, and he tolerated this well without increase in output from either of his JP drains or from his pigtail catheter, situated in the splenic bed.
