A single portable chest radiograph again demonstrates a right internal jugular central venous catheter.
No pneumothorax.
Bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
There is interval removal of the left chest tube.
Again seen is a small left apical pneumothorax which appears unchanged in size (approximately 5%).
There is atelectasis at both lung bases and likely small pleural effusions.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 66 year old man s/p esophagectomy with L foot trauma REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: fx?
Joint spaces are maintained without periarticular erosion.
Dense vascular calcifications are noted.
Esophageal squamous epithelium at proximal margin and gastric corpus mucosa at distal margin.
Lymph nodes, left gastric (AB-AF): Eight lymph nodes, with metastatic adenocarcinoma in one.
Distance of invasive carcinoma from closest margin:  4 mm.
The specimen is opened to reveal tan-pink glandular mucosa extending above the GE junction approximately 4 cm.
There is a 3.0 x 1.9 cm ulcerated lesion within this area of glandular extension into the esophagus, that abuts the GE junction and is located approximately 2.9 cm from the esophageal margin and 7.0 cm from the stomach margin.
Frozen section diagnosis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7108**] is "esophageal margin; no malignancy identified.
The specimen is represented as follows: A-M = completely submitted ulcerated lesion extending distally, N = representative sections of unremarkable esophageal squamous mucosa, O-P = GE junction, Q = esophagus with glandular mucosa, R-S = grossly unremarkable gastric mucosa, T-X = gastric resection margin, Y-AA = possible lymph nodes.
Part 2 is additionally labeled "left gastric lymph nodes" and consists of a fragment of yellow fibrofatty tissue measuring 6.9 x 4.4 x 2.8 cm.
Representative sections of possible lymph nodes are submitted in AB-AF.
