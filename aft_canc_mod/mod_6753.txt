Per report, she had been in her USOH until the day of admission when she developed fevers and had progressive bloodly secretions from her trach.
She apparently had been having some bloody trach secretions for some time since she had started her XRT/chemotherapy but these increased yesterday.
In the ED, she was initially febrile to 102.8 but had no complaints and was satting well on RA but was put on O2 because of increased secretions.
Her labs were significant for hyponatremia and borderline neutropenia and she received cefepime (had already received vancomycin at her NH).
CTA showed only known metastatic pulmonary disease w/out infiltrate or obvious source of her bleeding.
In the ICU, she denied any difficulty breathing, N/V, abdominal pain, chest pain, HA, difficulty with vision, diarrhea, dysuria, or weakness.
She did complain of some neck and mouth pain.
