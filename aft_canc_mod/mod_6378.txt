He was initially admitted on [**2136-7-25**] after presenting with dark, maroon stools for a few days.
On the evening prior to admission to [**Hospital1 18**], he was walking to the bathroom and felt light-headed without loss of consciousness and fell onto his knees and struck his head.
It demonstrated a small right frontal subdural hematoma with minimal mass effect on the R frontal lobe and no midline shift.
His exam was notable for word finding difficulties but he was otherwise non-localizing neurologically.
Exam was positive for maroon stool in rectum and labs demonstrated hct 22; he was transfused two units of PRBC and GI was notified.
He also had pelvis plain films and CT c-spine that were negative for fracture by prelim.
AML - Newly diagnosed; associated with neutropenia and pancytopenia.

Imaging: [**7-27**] CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST No fracture.
Extensive degenerative changes throughout the entire cervical spine with moderate-to-severe spinal canal narrowing, most marked at C3-4.
[**7-27**] CT Head w/o contrast Small bilateral acute subdural hematomas, left greater than right, measuring up to 3 mm in maximum thickness.
In addition, new component of the subdural hematoma overlying the right parietal lobe measures up to 3 mm in maximum thickness was not as prominent on the previous study.
[**7-29**] CT Head w/o contrast Increased size of bilateral subdural hematomas, specifically with increase in the hyperdense components, reflecting acute hemorrhage.
[**2136-8-1**]: CT head w/o contrast: IMPRESSION: No appreciable interval change in the size of subdural hematomas, without evidence of new hemorrhage.

CT head demonstrated small bilateral SDH and he was evaluated by neursurgery who recommended supportive care and platelet goal >80.
There was evidence of possible aspiration pneumonia though pt maintained sats on RA and did not complain of cough.
There was no evidence of GI bleeding while on the floor, though he did require intermittent plt and blood transfusions to maintain goals set by neurosurgery.
Serial CT scans showed relative stability of SDH and fever curve trended down though pt remained delirious.
Palliatve care was consulted and though serial family meetings with HCP and family, they decided to transition care to goals of comfort given the poor overall prognosis of progressive AML without treatment.
Pt was intermittently agitated and complaining of headache, these symptoms have been controlled with Zyprexa and Morphine.
