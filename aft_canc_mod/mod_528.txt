Admission Date:  [**2126-8-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2126-8-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2069-3-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Zanaflex / Aspirin / Premphase / lisinopril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: abdominal pain, tenesmus  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation and mechanical ventillation arterial line internal jugular central venous line  History of Present Illness: 57 year old female with stage 1 breast cancer s/p initiation of docetaxel and carboplatin on [**2126-8-2**], now presenting with abdominal pain and dysuria.
She characterizes the suprapubic pain as sharp and radiating to back and right flank.
Symptoms notable for intermittent chills and diaphoresis, nausea with one episode of vomitous.
As her pain worsened throughout the day, she called the [**Hospital **] clinic and proceeded to the ED.
She did contact her oncologist ([**Name (NI) **]) on [**8-5**] with multiple issues, including hyperglycemia to the 300s-400s, acute on chronic back pain, and constipation with mild abdominal pains.
She attributed her abdominal pain at that time to constipation because she had not stooled in 2 days.
Exam was notable for right CVA and suprapubic tenderness, without peritoneal signs.
Her blood pressures then started to decline and she became more tachypneic and in increasing respiratory distress.
CT abdomen showed extensive inflammatory mural thickening/stranding of the distal descending colon/sigmoid and rectum with free intraperitoneal fluid, not likely ischemic colitis.
She has been on hormonal therapy for 3 weeks at age 51 but had alopecia so stopped.
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - [**2126-5-17**]: mammogram and ultrasound due to left axillary pain with left breast 1 cm mass in the inferomedial breast, measured 0.8X0.6X0.6cm with irregular margins with ultrasound.
[**1-3**] lymph nodes were without disease.
No family history of breast or ovarian cancer.
Had an uncle who may have had a severe skin cancer of the face.
Physical Exam: Admission Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 97.7 BP: 62/41 P: 155 R: 24 18 O2: 97% on AC 400/24/5/100% General: intubated and sedated HEENT: pupils minimally responsive, sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx not visualized Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: tachycardic, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi Abdomen: tense and quite distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly appreciated GU: foley in place Ext: cool, weak pulses bilaterally, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: corneal reflexes not intact by eyelash stimulation, responds to pain without sedation  Patient expired during hospitalization: Cardiac sounds absent, pulses absent.
Corneal reflexes negative.
CT abdomen: IMPRESSION:  Extensive inflammatory mural thickening and stranding involving the distal descending colon, sigmoid and rectum with accompanying free intraperitoneal fluid, but no free air.
Ischemia is less likely given the distribution.
Brief Hospital Course: 57 year old female with stage I ER/PR negative, Her2-neu positive breast cancer s/p initiation of docetaxel/carboplatin + trastuzumab regimen admitted with abdominal/flank/rectal pain; found to have severe septic shock requiring intubation and pressors with CT abdomen showing severe colonic thickening in the setting of neutropenia.
# Septic shock [**1-3**] neutropenic enterocolitis/typhlitis: Her abdominal/rectal pain may be secondary to the colitis seen in the distal colon (sigmoid and rectum) and this inflammatory/infectious process combined with her profound neutropenia may have lead to her sepsis.
This GI process would explain the elevated lactate and subsequent hypotension from septic shock, though the pattern is strange and does not coincide with an ischemic pattern or any particular disease process.
Blood cultures ended up growing CLOSTRIDIUM SEPTICUM, which causes clostridial myonecrosis or a condition called "spontaneous gas gangrene", usually seen in those with risk factors of immunocompromise including colonic malignancy, neutropenia, or chemotherapy.
Surgery was involved and believed that an ex-lap or any other intra-abdominal procedure would have been extremely risky and likely hasten her death.
She was aggressively resuscitated with IVF, diabetic ketoacidosis was treated with insulin gtt and aggressive IVF resuscitation with potassium repletion, and she was covered with antibiotics initially with vancomycin IV, cefepime, metronidazole, as well as PO and PR vancomycin for presumed severe C. diff infection.
ID team also recommended checking for Strongyloides infection in the setting of her immunocompromise, which was ultimately negative.
She was also given stress-dose steroids with the recent history of dexamethasone with chemotherapy, but the blood pressure did not respond.
