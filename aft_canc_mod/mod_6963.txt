Past Medical History: # stage IV non-small cell lung cancer metastatic to brain, adrenals, kidneys (see below) # h/o intermittent asthma # h/o tooth infection & extraction between [**2184-2-15**].
# Prior history of obesity.
Past Oncologic history: Initially presented in [**2-/2184**] with complaints of weight loss, nausea and vomiting.
It seems that her symptoms were initially mild.
She did not have shortness of breath, cough or other complaints at that time.
By [**3-/2184**], she continued to lose weight and was found to have a potential right-sided dental abscess.
She was treated for that empirically with antibiotics and continued to have weight loss, diarrhea.
It seems that in the end of [**Month (only) 958**] and beginning of [**5-/2184**], the patient represented to medical attention with mild shortness of breath with exertion and chest discomfort.
She also had noted at that point subjective low-grade temperatures and some cough productive of brown sputum.
In [**5-/2184**], she already had a 20-pound weight loss.
During the initial presentation, she also complained of one episode of hemoptysis with production of more than one teaspoon of blood.
Due to the above-mentioned symptoms, the patient underwent a computer tomography of the chest on [**2184-5-14**] that disclosed a 2.6 cm cavitary lesion in the posterior right upper lobe with additional smaller right-sided pulmonary nodules and extensive right hilar lymphadenopathy with marked narrowing of the hilar airways and vessels.
There was also right upper lobe pulmonary interstitial thickening, which was worrisome for lymphangitic spread.
There was a subtle sclerosis of the T4 vertebral body.
There was no evidence of extrathoracic disease.
There were multiple enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes measuring up to 1.3 cm.
An MRI of head was performed on [**2184-5-29**] and showed multiple areas of enhancement identifying with surrounding edema in both cerebral hemispheres as well as in the posterior fossa.
However, she had no problems with motor strength up to the time of initial MRI when she developed some gait instability and required a cane.
She also complained of intermittent blurry vision.
All showed small nests of large cell undifferentiated carcinoma throughout brain lesions.
Due to the presence of nonsmall cell lung cancer with brain metastasis and edema, the patient was referred to neurooncology and radiation oncology.
She is currently in the planning stages of palliative chemotherapy.
She worked as a domestic cleaner and had some exposure to areas affected by asbestos and heavy chemicals.
[**Name2 (NI) **] maternal grandfather had a diagnosis of stomach cancer.
Her paternal grandfather had a diagnosis of prostate cancer.

PA and lateral views may be helpful for further evaluation.
Multiple bilateral hypoechoic renal masses, consistent with known metastases.
Doppler ultrasound demonstrates rapid systolic upstrokes, with impaired diastolic flow, and elevated resistive indices.
These findings most likely reflect increased vascular resistance secondary to mass effect of multiple metastatic lesions.
There is no evidence for renal vein thrombosis.
Mediastinal widening and right hilar enlargement due to adenopathy are stable.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Echogenic lesion in bladder likely representing blood clot.
There has been no substantial change in the appearance of the hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Increase in confluence and increase in size of some of the bilateral renal lesions.
Retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy as before.
[**6-30**] bone scan: No evidence of osseous metastatic disease.
Abnormal uptake in the kidneys bilaterally.
The bleeding was from renal mets and was localized to the L kidney based on blood seen coming from the L ureter at cystoscopy.
The renal failure was believed to be due to a combination of ATN, mets, and contrast.
Her hospitalization has been further complicated by pneumonia and adrenal insufficiency.
A family meeting was convened and an accommodation was achieved wherein we would restart abx and try to relieve her of her anasarca using either diuretics or ultrafiltration.
That said, after failing diuretics and prolonged difficulties with the dialysis catheter, another meeting was convened.
During an ultrafiltration treatment, she went into respiratory failure and passed.

You were found to have acute renal failure and eventually needed to be placed on dialysis.
You developed pneumonia and received antibiotics for that.
