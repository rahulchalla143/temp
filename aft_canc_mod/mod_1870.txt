Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 29921**] is a 78 year old male with CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer who presented with AICD firing in the setting of new onset atrial fibrillation with RVR and MSSA bacteremia and septic arthritis.
Given his pain on presentation and multiple positive joint aspirations he was felt to have metastatic septic arthritis.
The source for initial bacteremia was not clear and transesophageal ECHO showed no evidence of endocarditis.
The patient had previously been noted to have gram negative rods in his sputum (Enterobacter cloacae), however, he had no clear evidence of pneumonia by chest x-ray.
# Atrial fibrillation: The patient initially presented with A. Fib with RVR ??????
apparently a new diagnosis for this patient.
His AICD had fired four times prior to admission for heart rates > 180.
He was ruled out for an MI with serial cardiac enzymes.
The day following admission the electrophysiology consultants performed a TEE that showed no clot in in the heart and no evidence of valvular or pacemaker lead endocarditis.
The patient was started on amiodarone and metoprolol and cardioversion was planned as it was felt that he was likely not a candidate for coumadin given his recent GI bleed and colon cancer.
However, he spontaneously  developed bradycardia at a V-paced rate of 50 bpm post-TEE in the setting of hyperkalemia.
Metoprolol was discontinued due to hypotension and the patient was continued on low dose amiodarone per EP recommendations.
The patient went back into atrial fibrillation in the morning of [**3-18**] in the setting of hypoxemia.
# Respiratory failure: The patient had a subacute exacerbation with decline over past the past 3-4 weeks.
He has COPD at baseline and had recently been treated for a COPD exacerbation and was on a prolonged steroid taper.
Subsequently, he had difficulty weaning from the ventilator, initially due to fluid retention in the setting of agressive IV fluid hydration required to support his blood pressure (he was 17L positive over his length of stay), as well as underlying COPD.
The patient was extubated on the afternoon of [**3-17**] and was alert, however, he was reintubated on the morning of [**3-18**] for worsening acidosis and hypoventilation with fatigue overnight.
# Acute Renal Failure: The patient initially presented with an elevated creatinine.
Initially this was felt to be pre-renal in the setting of sepsis and hypotension and urine lytes were consistent with this hypothesis.
Over time, however, his creatinine continued to rise and urine studies became consistent with ATN.
No urine eosinophils were identified, thus it was unlikely AIN due to nafcillin.
Initial renal ultrasound suggested right-sided hydronoephrosis and urology was consulted, however, non-contrast CT scan subsequently showed no hydronephrosis.
Of note, the patient has a mass lesion on the left previously seen on CT done [**2174-2-6**] at BIDN.
They recommended phosphate binders to treat the patient's hyperphosphatemia and also considered performing renal biopsy, but deferred when the family decided not to persue any further interventions on [**3-18**] and declined dialysis.
# Septic and gouty arthritis: The patient had a known history of gout.
When the aspirations showed bacteria on gram stain, the steroids were decreased, but then increased again per rheumatology recommendations for gout and slowly tapered off.
Colchicine was stopped due to worsening renal failure.
# Abdominal pain: Several days after admission the patient developed abdominal discomfort on exam.
LFTs, amylase, lipase, were all within normal limits and Tbili was mildly elevated.
Ultimately it was felt that the pain was secondary to bacteremia or some other process related to the patient's colon cancer.
Contrast CT scan could not be performed secondary to renal failure.
# Anemia: The patient was likely anemic from GI bleeding from his colon cancer and also anemia of chronic disease.
Per BIDN records his baseline hct was 35-37 prior to his diagnosis of colon cancer.
# Thrombocytopenia: The patient did have a decrease in his platelets which may have been multifactorial, including HIT, uremia and DIC.
# Colon Cancer: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest on last CT scan.
Further evaluation was deferred until his acute illness could resolve.
# Pressure Ulcers: The patient had some sacral skin breakdown on admission.
Local wound care, frequent turns, special mattress, and close monitoring for areas of peripheral necrosis were performed.
# Hyperglycemia: The patient has no history of diabetes.
He was electively intubated after discussion with both him and his wife as it was initially felt that his acute illness might be reversible.
