HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60 year old female with a history of low grade Stage IV follicular lymphoma, status post multiple recurrences auto bone marrow transplant and questionable history of congestive heart failure, who presented from clinic with fever and neutropenia.
She had been feeling well and has no complaints.
She denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, neck pain, worsening cough or other symptoms.
She did complain of chronic sore throat and a herpetic lesion on her right lip.
Low grade lymphoma initially Stage IV follicular lymphoma    diagnosed in [**2180**].
auto bone marrow transplant in [**2183**], had eighteen    months of remission with recurrence and was treated with    Rituxan in [**2185**], [**2186**], and [**2187**].
In [**2188-9-5**], she was    found to have new anemia and progressive lymphadenopathy    in the axillary, hilar, subcarinal, inguinal regions.
She was admitted again [**10-9**],    with another cycle with the course complicated by    congestive heart failure that responded to diuretics.
She    was admitted again in [**11-8**], for a third cycle with a    complicated course in which she was intubated and required    monitoring in the Intensive Care Unit.
She subsequently    went to [**State 108**] for the winter and was recently admitted    [**5-10**], for a cycle of CEPP with Cytoxan, Etoposide,    Prednisone for presumably large B cell lymphoma    transformation.
History of gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Seasonal allergies.
Possible history of congestive heart failure with an    ejection fraction of 45 to 50 percent on previous    echocardiograms.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
Head and neck examination revealed mild alopecia.
The oropharynx showed some diffuse erythema.
Neck - mild shotty cervical lymphadenopathy, no swelling.
Lungs revealed slight decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally, right greater than left.
Cardiovascular examination revealed regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities - no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Cardiovascular - The patient had stable blood pressure on    admission but with her fever and neutropenia, she did have    an episode of lower systolic blood pressure into the 80s.
Also of note, there was a sessile mass    in the right atrium unclear significance.
Oncology/neutropenia - The patient is followed by Dr.    [**First Name (STitle) 1557**].
She was persistently neutropenic during the first    several weeks of her hospital course.
She had a small pleural    effusion tapped looking for source of infection which did    show atypical lymphocytes consistent with persistent    malignancy.
Pulmonary/infectious disease - The patient had febrile    neutropenia initially treated with Vancomycin, [**Month/Day/Year 18517**] and    AmBisome, as well as Flagyl.
She    slowly developed increasing oxygen requirement.
Although    her initial chest x-ray findings were negative, she seemed    to develop increasing infiltrates and effusions.
The    patient had sputum which was sent and consistent with a    pan-resistant Klebsiella which is only sensitive to    Meropenem.
She continued to have an increasing oxygen    requirement and at times required a nonrebreather.
She    had been getting nebulizers and steroid treatments because    of a possible history of chronic obstructive pulmonary    disease and chronic outpatient steroid use.
She was    aggressively diuresed for possible pulmonary edema    component of her hypoxia.
This showed significant mucous plugging and    also grew out some other pan-resistant Klebsiella.
The    patient was persistently hypoxic at the time of this    dictation.
Code Status - It was explained to the patient that as her    white blood cell counts increased and that we now    beginning to treat this pan-resistant Klebsiella that her    pulmonary status may decline in the short term until this    pneumonia resolves.
Anxiety - The patient appears to have a component of    anxiety with her hypoxia.
Standing benzodiazepines were    discontinued because of her tenuous respiratory status.
Orthopedics - The patient was wearing a brace on her right    hand for a healing fracture.
