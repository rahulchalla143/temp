Admission Date:  [**2124-8-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2124-9-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2066-4-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation during ICU course to protect your airway.
History of Present Illness: This is a 58 year old male with CML s/p allo stem cell transplant [**9-/2121**] c/b chronic GVHD of liver/lung/gut, O2 dependent bronchiolitis obliterans and bronchiectasis, presenting with hypoxia.
He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (onc) on [**8-24**] and noted to be having increased dyspnea.
He was discharged home from a rehab facility the day prior to admission, and was noted by his wife to be weak and tired with a poor appetite.
He felt very short of breath coming back from bathroom; brother-in-law reports he was ashen-looking and shaking, and sounded congested.
CXR showed LLL infiltrate and labs reveaked WBC of 8.7 with 33% bandemia.
Labs also showed troponin elevation with normal CK and EKG.
He denies any complaints, including pain or trouble breathing.
His last bone marrow biopsy was done in [**1-/2122**] and was consistent with remission from CML.
PCR has been negative for BCR-ABL.
In terms of chronic GVHD, he has had chronic abdominal discomfort since transplant that is thought to be associated with GVHD.
He last underwent enteroscopy in [**8-/2122**], which showed abnormal mucosa in the jejunum, normal mucosa in the duodenum, and erythema in the whole stomach compatible with gastritis.
These areas were biopsied showing chronic inflammation in the antral mucosa and focal active enteritis in the duodenum and jejunum.
His skin rash resolved on increased immunosuppression and he is now left with some hyperpigmentation and telangiectasia over areas of his face and back.
His liver function tests have been intermittently elevated and his immunosuppression has been titrated along with this.
He also has had persistent bilateral lower extremity edema that has limited his ambulation but it is unclear as to whether this is a GVHD manifestation or not.
In terms of other post-transplant complications, he has had a total of four compression fractures since the beginning of [**2122**] at T8, T9, T11, L1, and L3.
This has caused chronic pain.
He has been on chronic pain medication for the back pain, as well as the abdominal discomfort.
He was on anticoagulation for a PE diagnosed in [**3-/2123**] and this was stopped in [**9-/2123**] as he had received 6 months of anticoagulation and was also at risk for falls.
He was again noted for PE at the end of [**10/2123**] and a DVT in [**12/2123**] and is currently anticoagulated with lovenox.

The dorsum of the L foot is slightly erythematous and warm to the touch, but not particularly tender to palpation.
RRR no m/r/g.
Lungs: Diffuse coarse rhonchi bilaterally, no wheezing.
Abdomen: NABS, distended, diffusely tender without rebound or guarding.
Extremities: 2+ pitting edema to knees b/l.
Pulses difficult to palpate secondary to edema but feet are warm and well perfused.
Skin: markedly ecchymotic with several areas with small excoriations/skin breaks.
Large blood blister on mid-back, dressing is c/d/i.
New left lower lobe opacification, which could be secondary to infectious pneumonia and/or atelectasis.
Resolution of right upper lobe consolidation.
Stable bilateral cylindrical bronchiectasis and centrilobular emphysema.
Stable extent of multiple vertebral compression fractures, sternal fracture, and rib fractures  CT chest ([**9-8**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Progression of a left lower lobe consolidation as well as a right lower lobe consolidation.
These findings, in conjunction with history of fever and the presence of small bilateral pleural effusions suggests an infectious etiology.
Minimal bilateral upper lobe posterior opacities, possibly also infectious, though in the setting of visible secretions within the trachea and main stem bronchi, this distribution may also represent foci of aspiration.
Unchanged bilateral bronchiectasis and centrilobular emphysema.
Redemonstration of numerous compression fractures, sternal fracture, and rib fractures.
Dependent bilateral prominently basilar airspace opacities, associated pleural effusions, moderate on the left and small on the right, not significantly changed from the prior study and most likely representing atelectasis.
Infection is thought to be less likely.
Layering mucus vs debris noted within the distal trachea and bilateral main stem bronchi.

# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Given his immune compromised state and history of multi-drug resistant organisms, the concern was for a new pneumonia.
After a period of observation in the ER, it appeared that he was tiring and he was intubated for increased work of breathing.
He had a bronchoscopy that did not show many secretions or mucus plugging.
His chest x-ray appeared clear, CT scan the next day showed a new LLL opacity, and he was treated empirically with Zosyn and linezolid.
On hospital day #2 ([**2124-8-30**]), his respiratory status had improved significantly and he was able to be extubated without difficulty.
He was also started on prophylactic Azithromycin (see below) for its antimicrobial and antiinflammatory effects in bronchiolitis obliterans patients.
# Hypotension: Mr. [**Known lastname 976**] was hypotensive on admission, initially did not respond to fluids, thought to be due sepsis given his elevated lactate and bandemia.
# CML s/p BMT, Chronic GVHD, immunosuppression: patient with chronic abdominal pain, and GVHD of his lungs, liver and GI tract.
Per pulmonology recommendations, due to his pleural effusions, he was diuresed with improvement in his breathing.
CT Chest [**2124-9-17**] demonstrated continued bibasilar atelectasis and pleural effusions but it was felt that infection was less likely at this time.
He also had secretions in the trachea and bronchi, which he continued to have difficulty clearing although the acapella device, regular use of incentive spirometry, and cough assist machine greatly helped.
# Troponin Leak: Patient noted to have elevated troponin in the ER, with normal CK and CK-MB's, troponin trended down and the CK/CK-MB remained in the normal range.
His EKG did not show any ischemic changes, and the elevated troponins were thought to be due to demand ischemia in the setting of his initial hypotension.
# Diarrhea: Patient had multiple episodes of diarrhea prior to admission, has chronic diarrhea due to GVHD.
# Hx of PE, DVT: Has hx of multiple PEs in [**2122**] and DVT in early [**2123**], is on chronic anticoagulation, was continued on his home dose of lovenox 40mg [**Hospital1 **].
# Multiple Vertebral Fractures: patient on narcotics at home, methadone initially held while intubated and on a fentanyl drip, on extubation his home pain regimen was restarted.
# GERD: patient maintained on a PPI, due to history of GERD and chronic steroid use.
He will have outpatient follow-up with the hematology/oncology clinic and with pulmonary within several weeks of his discharge.
