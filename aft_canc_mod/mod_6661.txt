Admission Date:  [**2192-3-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2192-3-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2114-9-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain/ Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Cath Pericardial fluid drained   History of Present Illness: 77 yo M with hx of asthma, HL, Multiple myeloma presented to [**Hospital3 **] in [**Location (un) 620**] with cough and fever of one week duration .
The patient describes intermittent pleuritic chest pain and general malaise and weakness during a 5 day driving trip from [**State 15946**].
He said he took nsaids without relief.
He denied fevers/chills but endorsed a runny nose.
At [**Location (un) 620**], he had a low-grade fever and was originally treated empirically for presumed PNA.
However on the day of admission he became tachypneic into the 140s and underwent a CT-A of his chest to rule out PE which showed a large pericardial effusion.
Patient also had evidence of pericardial tamponade with elevated neck veins, tachycardia.
He was transfered here and underwent emergent ECHO which showed large pericardial effusion and hypercontractile ventricle.

CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi in frontal fields (pt could not sit s/p cath) ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominal bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+  On discharge: alert, walking around halls without difficulty.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2192-3-20**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..     FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):     ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2192-3-20**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75%).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to large circumferential pericardial effusion with early tamponade physiology.
There is a small pericardial effusion, possibly loculated, subtending the right ventricular free wall and also the basal lateral wall of the left ventricle.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There is patchy airspace opacification at the bilateral lower lobes, small bilateral pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 yo M with asthma, MM, HL presents with one week of fatigue/malaise and chest pain with pericardial effusion.
The most likely etiology is viral pneumonia with associated pericardial effusion.
ACTIVE ISSUES .
# PERICARDIAL EFFUSION [**1-4**] respiratory viral process: He presented with a large effusion by TTE, explaining his chest pain.
The drain was left in place until there was no further drainage.
To rule out other causes, further testing was done: TSH normal (2.2), HIV negative, [**Doctor First Name **] negative.
We felt this was likely due to his pericarditis.
Since he continued to have mild chest discomfort, he was started on colchicine on discharge until follow-up with his outpatient cardiologist, after consultation with his outpatient oncologist.
His upper respiratory symptoms improved and he will finish out a 7-day course of levofloxacin for his presumed pneumonia.
It is likely that the effusion is the cause of his Afib through dynamic wall stretch.
On the morning after admission, pt had an asymptomatic episode of bradycardia into the 30s while converting to sinus rhythm.
He had no further episodes and his EKGs were stable upon discharge, in NSR.
Urine studies and very small response to fluid boluses made this clinical picture more consistent with SIADH.
# ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: Creatinine peaked at 1.3, initially thought to be secondary to hypovolemia.
# ASTHMA: Chronic and stable.
# MULTIPLE MYELOMA: He is followed closely as outpatient with skeletal surveys, appears to be "smoldering" and he has not undergone treatment so far.
Disp:*3 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* 3. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) puffs Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
6. acetaminophen 500 mg Capsule Sig: [**12-4**] Capsules PO every eight (8) hours as needed for pain fever.
Multiple myeloma Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You had a collection of fluid around your heart that we believe was related to your fever and possible pneumonia.
This was causing your chest pain.
This fluid was sent to the lab to check for abnormal cells and infection.
Your pain and breathing improved after removal of the fluid and 2 subsequent echocardiograms did not show that the fluid was coming back.
