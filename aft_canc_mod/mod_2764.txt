Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: 97.8 62 106/50 18 93% RA General: Alert, oriented to person, place, no acute distress, HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, Lungs: no respiratory distress CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, holosystolic murmur  Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds normoactive, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly, incision healing well, clean, dry, and intact GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema   Pertinent Results: PRBCx1 Hct 24.5--> 29.9-> 30.7  FVII (74) and [**Doctor First Name 81**] (17), vitB12 (1616) and folate (15.6)  PTT - 10/1242.5  CT ABDOMEN: Pleural plaques are noted suggestive of prior asbestos exposure.
There are bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis, moderate on the right, small on the left.
Thick mitral annular calcifications, aortic valve calcifications and multivessel coronary arterial disease are noted.
A 1.2-cm low-density left hepatic lobe lesion (2, 14) likely represents a cyst.
More superiorly in the medial dome (2, 11), there is a 1.5-cm ovoid lesion, which could represent a hemangioma, but is incompletely evaluated on this single phase study.
There is no biliary dilatation.
A nondistended gallbladder contains multiple stones as well as amorphous lower density material.
The pancreas is diffusely atrophic.
The left adrenal gland demonstrates slight thickening along the lateral limb, without definite nodularity.
Bilateral kidneys demonstrate cortical thinning and contain multiple cysts, some of which are too small to fully characterize.
Multiple parapelvic cysts are seen on the left.
Of note, a 3.2 x 1.7 cm exophytic left renal mass demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement, highly concerning for RCC.
There is no dilated bowel loop to suggest obstruction.
There is no focal mural thickening to suggest inflammation.
There are extensive atherosclerotic calcifications involving the entire extent of descending aorta and origin of major branches.
There is no free air or free fluid.
Mild anasarca is present.
Left renal mass with appearance highly concerning for RCC.
Gallbladder contains stones and amorphous material.
No evidence of colitis.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Moderate right and small left pleural effusions.
Pleural plaques suggestive of asbestos exposure.
Livers cyst and possible hemangioma, incompletely assessed due to single phase study.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 46**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man with PMH including HTN, moderate AS, severe MR, Hemophilia C (Factor [**Doctor First Name 81**] deficiency), and recent bacteremia/C diff ([**Hospital1 756**] in [**Month (only) 116**]) who presented to the ED on [**2194-10-16**] with 1 episode of BRBPR, weakness.
He had acute systolic CHF s/p blood transfusions while in the ICU, requiring furosemide.
He was found to have diverticulosis and a cecal mass with bleeding, suspcious for carcinoma.
Surgical intervention was planned at this point and the patient had an echocardiogram and a cardiology consultation for pre-operative risk stratification.
His foley was discontinued on POD2 and replaced later that day because of hematuria and possible urethral obstruction due to blood cloths.
His foley was discontinued 24 hrs prior to discharged and the patient voided without difficulty.
The paient will follow up with Urology as an outpatient for further management of his urinary retention and hematuria, as well as for work up and further treatment of possible RCC.
Heme/Onc followed the patient throughout his stay for his hemophilia C and Factor [**Doctor First Name 81**] deficiency, they recommended no anticoagulation and Amicar +/- FFP if bleeding reccured.
On HD 18 the patient developed new onset Afib which was controlled with PO metoprolol.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating with assistance, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
Disp:*42 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] Nursing Care Center  Discharge Diagnosis: ## lower GI bleed: found to be secondary to colon cancer ## Acute blood loss anemia ## Factor [**Doctor First Name 81**] deficiency, required FFP on presentation and Amicar for procedures ## Acute sytolic heart failure related to volume overload ## Severe valvular heart disease  (moderate AS, severe MR) ## Possible Renal Cell Carcinoma: 3.2 x 1.7 cm exophytic left renal mass, highly concerning for renal cell carcinoma, seen on CT scan.
## suspected squamous cell skin cancer on right forehead ## Macrocytic anemia with normal B12 ## Hypertension ## BPH with urinary retention ## Multifactorial gait disorder requiring a walker at baseline ## Glaucoma ## New Onset Atrial Fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Return to the ER if: * If you are vomiting and cannot keep in fluids or your medications.
* Any serious change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms that concern you.
* Do not drive or operate heavy machinery while taking any narcotic pain medication.
You may have constipation when taking narcotic pain medications (oxycodone, percocet, vicodin, hydrocodone, dilaudid, etc.
You were admitted to the hospital with severe anemia from a bleeding source in your large intestine.
You also had congestive heart failure which responded well to diuretic medications.
Ultimately, colonoscopy confirmed the source to be a mass in your colon very suspicious for cancer.
Unfortunately we also found a tumor in your left kidney that is quite worrisome for a kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma).
Please see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] from Urology for the tumor in your kidney and to follow up on the postoperative urinary retention.
