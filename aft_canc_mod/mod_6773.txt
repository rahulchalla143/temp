She was born to a 34 year-old, G1, P1 now 2 mother by Cesarean section for breech presentation (this twin was breech) and unstoppable preterm labor.
This pregnancy was complicated by IVF di/di twins, shortened cervix, preterm labor and PPROM for almost 60 hours.
Her magnesium was discontinued on [**2121-3-15**] in the evening when she was beta complete and was restarted a few hours labor for increasing preterm labor.
Mild cephalo molding.
Breath sounds clear and equal bilaterally with mild retractions.
Mild dependent edema of the lower extremities and groin.
Abdomen soft and round with active bowel sounds.
Small umbilical hernia present.
No masses palpable.
Normal female GU with mild edema.
Spine straight, no sacral dimple.
Neuro: Alert and active, normal cry, suck, tone and gag reflexes present.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  Respiratory: The infant had respiratory distress syndrome on admission to the NICU and was given 2 doses of Surfactant therapy on the newborn day.
She remained on room air until [**2121-5-17**] at which time, due to oxygen desaturation drift, she was started on nasal cannula oxygen.
Due to spells, she was started on CPAP on [**2121-5-18**] and she received approximately 24 hours of CPAP and then the CPAP was discontinued and she returned to room air on [**2121-5-19**] after packed red blood cells transfusion for anemia.
She remains on caffeine citrate at this time and she does have an occasional yet rare apneic episode on a daily basis.
Cardiovascular:  She was treated with indomethacin on day one of life for an audible murmur and active precordium.
She received only a single course of indomethacin and had follow-up echocardiogram on [**2121-3-19**] which showed no PDA but a PFO was present at that time.
Cardiology was consulted and the EKG showed sinus tachycardia.
The caffeine citrate was held for approximately 3 days as it was felt to be the cause of the tachycardia and the tachycardia resolved.
There have been no further cardiac issues.
She does still present with an intermittent audible murmur which is felt to be PPF.
Enteral feedings were initiated on [**2121-3-20**] with a slow advance.
She has had no recent electrolytes measured.
Gastrointestinal: The infant developed hyperbilirubinemia and was treated with phototherapy for approximately 8 days with a peak bilirubin level of 5.0 over 0.3.
She has had no other GI issues.
She had remained stable with anemia of prematurity up until [**2121-5-18**] at which time, due to worsening respiratory status, going from room air to nasal cannula to CPAP and having spells, she was treated with packed red blood cells at that time and since then has resolved her respiratory status and is presently on room air after the transfusion.
She had a CBC and blood culture done on [**2121-3-30**], day of life 14, for increased apneic/bradycardiac episodes.
CBC and blood culture were screened on [**2121-5-18**] due to increased spells.
There was no left shift.
Ophthalmology:  The infant has had 2 ophthalmologic evaluations with the most recent being on [**2121-5-12**] which showed immature retina with vascularization to zone 3 with a planned follow-up ophthalmologic exam 3 weeks from that date, which would be the week of [**2121-6-2**].
Results initially were abnormal due to parenteral nutrition and the state screens have normalized to date with the most recent being totally within normal limits.
Immunizations recommended: Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who meet any of the following four criteria:  (1) Born at less than 32 weeks; (2) Born between 32 weeks and 35 weeks with two of the following:  Day care during RSV season, a smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities or school age siblings; (3) chronic lung disease or (4) hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease.
Before this age, and for the first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
Respiratory distress syndrome resolved.
Sepsis ruled out.
Breech presentation.
Left leg hemangioma ongoing.
Sinus tachycardia resolved.
Apnea of prematurity ongoing.
10.Anemia of prematurity ongoing.
11.Rule out sepsis ongoing.
