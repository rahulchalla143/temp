She was feeling generally well with her baseline amount of energy until [**5-/2127**] when she noted increasing fatigue and was noted to be pancytopenic.
She reported easy nose bleeds and gum bleeding at that time.
A bone marrow biopsy on [**2127-6-26**] revealed a hypocellular bone marrow with 5-10 % cellularity and no evidence of leukemia or other marrow infiltration.

#Pancytopenia, diagnosed as AML:  Throughout her hospital stay, the pt had profound pancytopenia and required intermittent transfusion support of red cells and platelets.
Pt was negative for PNH.
Bone marrow biopsy was performed on [**8-14**] and was interpreted as myelodysplastic syndrome evolving to an acute erythroid leukemia.
The patient had multiple subsequent bone marrow biopsies which showed definate evolution to AML.
There was concern that her Hepatitis C virus was contributing to the marrow suppression; Hepatology was consulted and felt this was not the case.
She was started on Fluconazole and Acyclovir for neutropenic prophylaxis.
She was then found to be bacteremic on [**10-13**] blood cultures with coagulase negative staph, which is oxacillin-resistant, and sensitive to vancomycin.
On [**10-18**], cefepime was discontinued, as she remained afebrile upon starting vancomycin.
At that time, fluid restriction to 1L was started, urine and urine electrolytes were obtained, which showed elevated urine sodium and and osmolality of 568.
# Mucositis: The patient began to experience symptoms of mucositis on day+1, including mouth pain, abdominal pain and diarrhea.
She was ruled out for C. diff infection.
# Hepatitis C:  Patient has been a non-responder to interferon and Ribaviron therapies.
#Abnormal lung findings on CT:  CT chest showed presence of ground glass opacities in bilateral lobes c/w infectious etiology.
After the extraction, pt developed intense pain at the site, radiating to her L frontal sinus and ear.
As she was neutropenic, infection was suspected and she was started on Unasyn.
Oral surgeon was re-evaluated the site of extraction and agreed with abx and also suggested a dressing for alveolar osteoitis if the pain does not resolve with abx.
Pt then became febrile and was switched to Zosyn, completing a 7 day course.
She was subsequently switched to Levofloxacin and Clindamycin; then just to Levofloxacin as there was no evidence of further dental infection.
# Depression/Anxiety:  The patient remained fatigued and weak and with some degree of emotional lability.
# Hepatitis B: The patient was found to have a positive core antibody but a negative viral load.
But patient was unable to take lamivudine due to mucositis.
# Rash: Soon after starting chemotherapy, the patient developed a rash on her shins thought to be related to her chemotherapy.
She also had a similar rash on her lower abdomen, which then became more circular and localized with one particular area suggstive of ungal infection.
In addition, she briefly developed a contact dermatitis under her breasts bilaterally secondary to the adhesive on EKG leads; hydrocortisone was prescribed to these areas only.
# Hypertension: After starting Cylosporine, the patient began having persisent high blood pressures.
She was started on a calcium channel blocker to treat cylosporine-induced hypertension.
In addition, her cyclosporine dose was decreased and then held due to supratherapeutic levels.
Her blood pressures were high in the SBP's 160's-190's, particulary when agitated or stimulated.
# Acute Renal Failure: Her creatinine began rising on [**11-20**] and steadily climbed during her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay.
The nephrology team was consulted and found significant muddy-brown casts on urine microscopy.
She was diagnosed with ATN secondary to cyclosporine toxicity.
Given her elevated cyclosporine levels, the dosages had already been substantially reduced.
Due to her ARF and volume overload that was thought to be contributing to her failure to wean from the vent, CVVH was started on [**12-6**] and continued through [**12-16**].
RIJ dialysis line was discontinued on [**12-16**] secondary to fever, and CVVH was not restarted as the patient was not volume overloaded and did not have electrolyte abnormalities necessitating dialysis.
Patient began having increased urine output on [**12-18**].
# Respiratory Failure: On [**2127-11-24**], the patient began having respiratory distress and hypoxia.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
Her CXR showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates concerning for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 16030**] PNA, pulmonary edema or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
She was started on Clindamycin and Primaquine as well as steroids for empiric PCP treatment given recent failure to take PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
There was no purulent material or gross blood noted - making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage less likely.
BAL did not reveal any WBC's, RBC's, bacterial culture, fungal culture, viral culture negative and Nocardia negative.
Respiratory viral antigens were also negative.
She was changed from Caspofungin to Posaconazole when one isolate of PITHOMYCES (diamacious fungus)grew from her pleural cultures.
A chest CT showed significant improvement suggestive of either resolving infection or decreasing pulmonary edema.
A repeat bronchoscopy was performed which showed gross purulent material on the ET tube but no blood.
In addition, CVVH was intiated for aggressive diuresis to treat pulmonary edema.
She continued to have an elevated WBC despite this treatment.
She was still undergoing treatment for pseudomonas VAP, and is currently Day [**7-4**] of meropenem.
The dose has fluctuated given her changing renal status, from 1.25mg/kg Q24 to 1.25mg/Kg 3Xweek.
#Coag neg Staph: patient had coag neg staph grow from tip culture on [**12-16**].
Given her changing creatinine clearance, her vancomycin levels were checked daily and vancomycin dosed accordingly.
# Leukocytosis: The patient had leukocytosis during her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay.
PNA, infectious diarrhea and line infections were considered.
At each attempt to discontinue Vanc, her leukocytosis re-appeared suggesting a MRSA or gram positive infection - possible line infection.
However, she was then found to have purulent material in her ET tube suggestive of a bacterial, VAP that could be the source of the leukocytosis.
She was treated with Cefepime and Cipro until the gram stain only showed oralpharyngeal flora.
As above, she continued to have an elevated white count despite double pseudomonal coverage.
Her leukocytosis gradually decreased coinciding with tapering of her methylprednisolone.
However, WBC dropped to 1.5 on [**12-24**] and medications were examined for potential myelosuppression.
#Hyponatremia: Na 135->129/130 since starting CVVH - CVVH removing fluids vs extravascular free water now returning to intravascular space and causing a dilutional effect?
woman s/p 7+3, and s/p allogenic bone marrow transplant on [**10-29**], transferred to the MICU after tonic clonic seizure and hypoxic respiratory failure.
# Respiratory Failure - Patient experienced acute desaturation following bone marrow biopsy and LP.
Acute worsening of CXR likely due to dependent shift of phlegm.
Underlying problem: PNA v. pulmonary hemorrorhage in setting of seizure with platelets of 17 v aspiration pneumonitis.
Bronchoscopy revealed numerous blood clots, likley old blood from tracheostomy placement.
Patient continued to be tachypneic with rates from 30-40, along with ABG showing relative hypercarbia and hypoxia despite vent changes.
Clinical picture suggestive of severe airway disease.
her ceftazidime was continued, along with the addition of colistin for pseudomonas VAP.
# Seizure and depressed mental status -patient experienced tonic clonic seizure on [**12-25**] on BMT floor in setting of pancytopenia and low platelet count.
Initial concern for intracranial bleeding.
CT did not show evidence of bleeding.
MRI c/w Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome.
The patient remained unresponsive overnight, however EEG did not reveal any seizure activity.
# Pancytopenia - Thought to be drug effect v. loss of engraftment.
Bone marrow biopsy was not consistent with loss of graft, and she was continued on neupogen .
#CMV Viremia-Viremia detected from PCR, repeat PCR showing increased viremia.
She has undergone a long preparation for allogenic BMT including 7+3 induction chemotherapy, completion of abx for a tooth extraction, liver biopsy for history of Hepatits C/B and initiation of lamivudine prophylaxis, and bronchoscopy for findings of ground glass opacities on chest CT. She received a stem cell marrow transplantation on [**10-29**] without any immediate complications.
Cyclosporin d/c'd because of renal failure.
Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute Myelogenous Leukemia Hepatitis B&C Cytomegaloviremia   Discharge Condition: Patient deceased.
