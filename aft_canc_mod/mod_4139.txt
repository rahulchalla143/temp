DIAGNOSIS  Bone marrow aspirate and core biopsy:  Hypocellular bone marrow with persistent involvement with acute myelogenous leukemia.
Red cells show mild anisopoikilocytosis with rare teardrop and fragmented cells.
ASPIRATE SMEARS    The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation, however, it contains only rare hypocellular spicules almost entirely composed of stomal cells, lymphocytes, and histiocytes.
Of scant hematopoietic elements present, a large number are represented by blasts with morphologic features similar to those seen at first diagnosis..   Megakaryocytes are not seen.
CLOT SECTION AND BIOPSY SLIDES  The marrow is markedly hypocellular with eosinophil debris consistent with recent chemotherapy.
In addition, there are several small islands of immature appearing lymphoid cells admixed with plasma cells.
Maturing myeloid and erythroid elements are rare.
While a subpopulation of cells show a definitive myeloid differentiation including Auer rods, a second population is composed of smaller cells with scant cytoplasm and overall lymphoid-appearing features.
Red cells show: anisocytosis, polychromasia with fine basophilic stippling, and tear drop forms.
there is a biphasic population of blasts.
Erythroid maturation is dyspoietic with asymmetric nuclear budding.
There is an interstitial infiltrate of immature mononuclear cells with scant cytoplasm consistent with blasts occurring  in sheets occupying >80% of marrow cellularity  Erythroid precursors occur in small clusters, are markedly decreased, but show maturation.
Flow cytometry of marrow showed acute myeloid leukemia with immature features.
Gross:  The specimen is received in B+ Fixative labeled with "[**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname 16376**]" and "M05-619" and consists of a bone core biopsy measuring up to 1.2 cm, and a single blood clot measuring up to 2.2 cm, entirely submitted into cassette coded A for decalcification.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2132-12-13**] 1:56 PM  CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  Reason: eval for progression of PNA, effusion, gallbladder pathology Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 24 year old man with AML and PNA.
now on HIDAC therapy w/ O2 requirement, RUQ pain and fever REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for progression of PNA, effusion, gallbladder pathology CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: AML and pneumonia with increasing oxygen requirement and right upper quadrant pain and fever.
Left-sided effusion may be slightly smaller compared to the prior study.
There is interval improvement in left upper lobe consolidation compared to previous study.
Multiple patchy areas of consolidation in the right upper and right lower lobe are again demonstrated.
There is possible slight interval improvement in several areas of peripheral opacity in the right upper lobe.
There is possible slight interval worsening in the right lower lobe opacity.
There is a trace right-sided pleural effusion.
Note is made of an approximately 1.5 cm new nodular density in the right lower lobe.
Loops of small and large bowel are of normal caliber with no bowel wall thickening.
Multiple small mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are unchanged.
No free air or free fluid.
Multiple small non-pathologically enlarged inguinal lymph nodes are stable.
Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Interval possible slight improvement in right upper lobe areas of peripheral opacity with interval improvement in left upper lobe process compared to previous exam.
There is possible slight interval worsening in right lung base compared to the previous exam.
A new nodular density in the right lower lobe likely represents infectious/inflammatory process or atelectasis given its rapid development.
No gallbladder or liver pathology identified.
24 year old man with recent PICC removal.
Now w/ shoulder/bicep pain and a palpable cord in his antecubital fossa.
Assess for venous thrombosis.
In the left cephalic vein starting at the antecubital fossa and extending superiorly up into the upper arm, just short of the shoulder, note is made of a thrombus within the cephalic vein.
Ultrasound shows echogenic material in the lumen and lack of compressibility.
CONCLUSION: Thrombus in the left cephalic vein extending from the anterior cubital fossa to the upper portion of the left upper arm.
Comparison assessment of the right side could not be performed as there is a central line within the corresponding vein in the right arm.

Brief Hospital Course: 24 y/o presenting with multilobar pneumonia and found to have AML M0 resistant to 7+3 and HIDAC with course complicated by staph epidermidis bacteremia.
AML -- The patient was in his USOH until several days prior to admission when he developed fevers and myalgias.
Concurrent with this diagnosis, the patient was transferred to the MICU for respiratory distress as below.
He finished a course of 7+3 but still had residual disease on a bone marrow biopsy after completion.
Following HIDAC therapy in late Noevember, he had a rebound in his platelets, but his WBC count remained low.
A repeat bone marrow biopsy on [**1-8**] revealed bone marrow cellularity of 10% consisting mostly of an infiltrate of immature mononuclear cells consistent with blasts, present in small clusters, with very limited erythropoeisis and abnormal appearing megakaryocytes.
ID - The patient developed fevers and myalgias several days before admission and was given tamiflu by his PCP he tested positive for influenza (subsequently tested negative here).
He continued to deteriorate and and had an oxygen requirement when transferred here as well as a temperature up to 105 that persisted for days.
His chest CT when he presented showed extensive disease.
He was sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for worsening oxygenation but avoided intubation and was gradually weaned off a NRB.
He developed a transaminitis to voriconazole and was switched to 5mg/kg of ambisome which he tolerated better.
He was restarted on vancomycin for a coag negative staph bacteremia and his line was initially switched over a guide wire.
At this time, the patient also began to complain of a pleuritic RUQ pain w/ mild radiation to his lungs.
His LFTs were stable and a CT torso showed no abdominal pathology to explain his pain.
However, the lungs still showed diffuse infiltrates c/w unresolved fungal infection and b/l effusions thought to cause his pain.
His fever and pleuritic RUQ pain resolved.
He received a holiday from his prophylactic acyclovir and his allopurinol was discontinued as a result of his continued elevated transaminases.
However, he developed acute renal failure.
He continued to remain afebrile and his vancomycin and acyclovir were discontinued.
He was discharged on meropenem with a CXR on [**1-4**] showing overall interval improvement in the previously visualized multifocal opacities, with residual opacities in the left retrocardiac region and left lung apex opacities."
ARF - likely ATN secondary to ambisome.
Eos negative, but patient had low total WBC count.
Creatinine reached a peak of 1.6 but decreased to 1.2 with fluid rehydration.
Atypical nevus - Patient was noticed to have an atypical nevus in the middle of his back during routine physical examination.
Hypertension and tachycardia - Throughout his admission, he was found to be tachycardic from 90-110 and was initially hypertensive with SBP in the 150s.
He was started on metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with good control of his BP, but continued to have some sinus tachycardia.
Heart failure - a TTE was initially ordered prior to his chemotherapy which showed a mildly depressed EF.
