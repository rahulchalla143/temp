The patient presented to clinic today with fever to 100.8 and a WBC count of 0.1 (ANC pending).
He was admitted for DPACE on [**2168-2-12**] due to rapid progression of disease (markedly elevated IgG level) s/p Cytoxan on [**2-1**].
He experienced progressive fatigue upon discharge home, however had no fevers or localizing signs at home.
He has had no appetite since discharge.
He has a rash on his scalp and face consistent with folliculitis which has been present since discharge.
Accompanying the above weakness, he has been experiencing some associated shortness of breath.
He has also developed some oral lesions.
He denied any nasal congestion, sore throat, headache, chest pain, dysuria, hesitancy or urinary frequency.
He does report some mild epigastric "pressure" which is relieved with belching.
He presented to clinic and on arrival noted a non-productive cough and fever.

Review of systems: No chest pain, palpitations.
No nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, or back pain.
No numbness or tingling of his extremities.
He denies any bleeding or increased bruising, hematuria, hematochezia, epistaxis or gum bleeding.
This treatment was complicated by a left leg DVT for which he was started on coumadin.

[**2-24**] Skin biopsy: Skin, right face  (A): Skin with central dilated follicle and mild perifollicular chronic inflammation.
Note:  No leukemic infiltrate is seen in the sections examined and inflammation is minimal (there is a focal mild perifollicular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate).
While there is a central dilated follicle, no Demodex is seen within the follicle.
The location is very atypical for a vegetation and no aortic regurgitation is seen.
Right lower lobe airspace disease, which may be infection or atelectasis.
L3 compression fracture deformity appears chronic.
No abnormal lesions within the liver or spleen, however, evaluation for hepatosplenic candidiasis is limited due to the lack of post-contrast imaging.
Right basilar atelectasis and small left-sided pleural effusion.
There is probably inferior hypokinesis but views are technically  suboptimal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Rapidly enlarging right hilar mass, obstructing the right middle lobe bronchi and markedly narrowing bronchus intermedius and right lower lobe bronchi.
Findings are most consistent with a neoplastic process, and bronchoscopy would have a high yield for diagnosis.
New small right pleural effusion.
Diffuse skeletal lucencies consistent with myeloma.
Discharge labs   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 54-year-old man w/ history of plasma cell leukemia/multiple myeloma who has hx of PE during treatment with Revlimid, s/p recent DPACE treatment here with febrile neutropenia.
# Plasma cell leukemia/myeloma: The patient recently received DPACE and was persistently neutropenic.
Originally presented with non-productive cough since this afternoon, oral lesions and papular rash noted on scalp and face.
He was originally started on Cefepime monotherapy for febrile neutropenia and Bactrim and Valacyclovir were continued for PCP and HSV prophylaxis respectively.
On [**2-24**], Cefepime was switched to [**Last Name (un) **]/Vanco as his blood cultures grew out Coagulase negative staph and strep viridans.
Given his slow to respond white count, the revlimid was tapered to 5mg daily and stopped temporarily.
He was also started on lovenox for DVT prophylaxis given his history of PE while on Revlimid.
Bm Bx done on [**3-9**] showed 50% plasma cells.
However, there were signs that disease is worsening (IgG increased to ?9000).
As well the right middle low mass that was thought to be a plasmacytoma showed increasing size on repeat CT.
Therefore he was started thalidomide [**4-28**] for treatment of myeloma as his disease was previously responsive to this.
# Dyspnea: Respiratory distress several times week of [**4-18**] and eventually needed [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay with 1 night of BiPAP after bronchoscopy thought to be due to pulmonary edema but with only mild improvement with lasix.
Also with concern for engraftment syndrome or DAH, but with little improvement with steroids or evidence on bronchoscopy.
No signs of fluid overload and improvement without diuresis making aspergillus infection likely.
# Muscle pain- Likely secondary to marrow edema or fungal infx.
# Hypertension/tachycardia- Occurred after transplant.
# Bacteremia: On cultures drawn on admission, he grew 2 bottles of coagulase negative staph and 1 bottle of strep viridans.
The suspected sources of the bacteremia were the rash of the scalp as a source of the coagulase negative staph and his aphthous ulcers as the source of his strep viridans.
Because of the culture positive for Strep viridans and question of possible endocarditis, an echocardiogram was done which showed a small fluttering echodensity on the aortic annulus which was stable from an echocardiogram three weeks earlier.
Multiple blood cultures were negative and cefepime and vancomycin were stopped after he was afebrile for 2 weeks.
As patient began to spike fevers again with no clear source these were restarted 1 wk prior to transplant.
An investigation was done and the conclusion was that the fever was likely due to the patient's bacteremia and was unrelated to the transfusion.
# Rash: The patient presented with a papular rash on scalp, face.
The results showed no leukemic infiltrate in the sections examined and inflammation is minimal (there is a focal mild perifollicular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate).
While there is a central dilated follicle, no Demodex was seen within the follicle.
He developed a second rash on [**2-25**] which seemed related in timing to the initiation of Meropenem and Vancomycin.
The rash resolved within 2 days and the atarax was stopped without recurrence of symptoms.
Per OMR, creatinine is often elevated with worsening of disease.
His creatinine continued to improve with hydration but again worsened when being diuresed for concern of volume overload.
Remains persistently high despite no diuresis.
Urine studies show likely secondary to myeloma.
# Transaminitis- patient has underlying fatty liver seen on RUQ US and MRI and then voriconazole was started which caused a rise in his LFTs.
