U/A showed evidence of infection.
As patient is allergic to zosyn, quinolones, ceftriaxone, flagyl and bactrim, she was treated with macrobid in the ED, and also given morphine and zosyn for her pain and nausea.
CT abd/pelvis in the ED showed moderate bilateral hydronephrosis, with diffuse bilateral hydroureters all the way to the ileual conduit which was concerning for distal obstruction.

GEN: obese AAF in mod distress [**3-4**] pain, lying on L side HEENT: EOMI, PERRLA no scleral icterus CV: RRR nl S1 S2 LUNGS: CTAB/L ABD: +BS soft but distended, diffusely TTP all over abd EXT: warm, well perfused 2+ distal pulses b/l NEURO: A&Ox3, able to answer questions appropriately SKIN: large area of skin breakdown and ulceration almost covering the entirity of buttocks worse on the right than left buttock, skin breakdown revealing pink granulation tissue w/ some central greyish-white necrosis but no obvious drainage or purulence, surrounding skin is not erythematous but is exquisitely TTP   Pertinent Results: CT AB/Pelvis with contrast IMPRESSION: 1.
Interval development of mild hydronephrosis and moderate hydroureter bilaterally with ureteral dilatation extending to the ileal conduit which is mildly distended compared to prior studies.
Clinical correlation is recommended to exclude a possible distal obstruction of the urostomy, resulting in upstream dilatation of the collecting systems due to reflux and back pressure.
No mechanical obstruction of the urostomy on this CT, however, is identified.
Unchanged bilateral renal cortical thinning, compatible with scarring from prior infectious or ischemic insults.
No intra-abdominal abscess.
Fibroid uterus.
Further incubation showed contamination with mixed fecal flora.

No bacteria or fungi are seen on Gram and PAS stained sections, however the involved follicle is not present on these section.
No interface dermatitis to suggest a fixed drug reaction is seen.
While clinically less likely, the histologic differential diagnosis includes an immunobullous disorder .
