Of note he had a recent admission from [**Date range (1) 10375**] for BRBPR requiring 7 units of PRBCs.
During that admission, he underwent EGD which showed an ulcerated, malignant-appearing mass in the antrum of the stomach, with stigmata of recent bleeding.
Biosies were taken but the vessel was unable to be clipped due to difficult location and access.
Patient reports that he had some vague abdominal pain yesterday and felt gassy.
This morning he felt extremely fatigued and short of breath.
He had a loose bowel movement this morning.
His fatigue and shortness of breath resolved with the unit of PRBCs.
He denies abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting.
MDS on dacogen - presented in [**2143-9-28**] with pancytopenia, complained of dyspnea on exertion - cytopenias progressed and he had a repeat bone marrow done in [**1-4**] which showed a markedly hypercellular bone marrow with significant dysplasia in the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages.
Cytogenetics revealed [**11-16**] cells have abnormal chromosome 12 and an abnormal chromosome 17 in a possible three way translocation.
- refractory to Procrit, at escalating doses and then became red blood cell transfusion dependent - Decitabine therapy was initiated [**2145-9-13**] but had to be discontinued due to a hematoma which developed at the site of a wound.
MALT lymphoma of the stomach: no evidence of disease since [**2142**] - initially presented in [**2139**] with abdominal upset/indigestion.
CT scan demonstrated perigastric adenopathy and EGD had a multilobulated mass with ulceration.
Biopsy demonstrated extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT).
- Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated mildly hypercellular marrow for age with megakaryocytic dysplasia and occasional ringed sideroblasts (10%) without evidence of lymphoma.
Evolving myelodysplastic syndrome could not be excluded.
- treated for Stage IIB MALT lymphoma of the stomach with 6 cycles of CVP, completed in [**11-30**] - recurred in [**2142**] and was treated with four weeks of Rituxan therapy ([**Date range (1) 51244**]) - no evidence of disease since this time.

[**5-31**] EGD: Schatzki's ring Erosions in the gastroesophageal junction compatible with esophagitis Mass in the lesser curvature (endoclip) Erythema and petechiae in the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis There is no fresh red blood or coffee-ground liquid in his stomach and duodenum.
Erythema in the antrum compatible with gastritis Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  CXR [**2146-6-2**]: In comparison with the study of [**5-31**], the left hemidiaphragm is more sharply seen, consistent with some improvement in the atelectatic change in the region.
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 85 yo with MDS and maltoma, and recent GI Bleed who presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with shortness of breath, found to have GI bleed.
Acute blood loss anemia:  Likely secondary to an upper GI bleed given his history of ulcerated maltoma in his GI tract, melena on exam, and a visible vessel which was clipped on EGD.
He continued to have episodes of diarrhea, but no further BRBPR.
#  Acute Kidney Injury:  Creatinine was up to 1.2 from baseline of 0.8 on admission.
Likely pre-renal, given blood loss and improvement with transfusions.
#  Pancytopenia:  Anemia most likely secondary to bleeding.
Myelodysplastic Syndrome on decitabine: He received C3 of decitabine from [**4-25**] - [**4-29**].
# Fevers: The patient with a febrile episode.
CXR revealed improving atelectasis, but no evidence of PNA.
