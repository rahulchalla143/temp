Admission Date:  [**2104-3-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2104-4-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2032-11-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ace Inhibitors  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8388**] Chief Complaint: Weakness, fatigue  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: N/A  History of Present Illness: 71 year old male with multifocal HCC, cirrhosis of unclear etiology, sent from PCP with complaint of worsening weakness/fatigue..  Labs drawn a few days ag ([**3-21**]) and CT abdomen (routine) today.
Pt and family states that over the last week he has felt worsening feeling of weakness and fatigue.
He does have a mild cough with mild sputum that has been ongoing for months.
The patient reports 25lb weight loss and complete resolution of his leg edema and abdominal girth since starting his diuretics in [**Month (only) 404**].
Mild asterixis.
Patient had a CTA torso which showed no definite PE, no source of bleeding seen but large ascites.
Decided not to tap him, without fever and WBC count, no abominal tenderness, less likely.
On review of his OMR notes, in late [**Month (only) 404**] the patient was noted by his liver doctors to be somewhat more encephalopathic and so his lactulose was increased and he was started on spironolactone and lasix.
At his follow up appointment on [**3-14**] he was noted to have poor PO intake with 10lb weight loss since starting the diuretics but his mental status had improved.

NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Segment VII lesion at the dome of the liver currently measures 1.4 x 1.4 cm, slightly decreased in size compared to the previous examination and has washout at the delayed phase, findings consistent with residual HCC.
The lesion in segment V/VI at the inferior pole of the liver currently measures 1.7 x 1.7 cm, slightly decreased in size compared to the previous examination.
This lesion is most probably consistent also with residual disease.
No lesion is identified in the periportal area which is suspicious for HCC.
Exophytic 0.8 cm enhancing nodule is seen just above the inferior pole of the right lobe liver lesion.
No definite pulmonary embolism identified, though assessment is limited due to suboptimal contrast timing.
Large amount of ascites, without evidence for hemoperitoneum or free air.
Multiple hepatic lesions, which are better characterized on a multiphasic CT scan performed on same day at 10:08 a.m. 5.
[**3-27**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%).
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: hyperdynamic left ventricle with at least mild outflow tract onstruction; small-to-moderate pericardial effusion (no deefinite tamponade signs)  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2103-10-11**], the heart rate is increased, with hyperdynamic function, and significant outflow tract obstruction.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 71 year old male with crypotogenic cirrhosis, HCC s/p cyberknife, and hepatic encephalopathy, who was started on lasix and spironolactone in [**Month (only) 404**] for  worsening edema and ascites resulting in a 25lb weight loss and resolution of peripheral edema and improvement in abdominal girth who presents with 1 week of weakness, found to have hypotension and hyponatremia.
# Hyponatremia - Thought to be secondary to hypovolemic hyponatremia which is consistent with his recent history of an increase in diuretic dosing.
# Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - TTE revealed hyperdynamic LV (EF > 80%) with decreased LV dimensions and mild outflow tract obstruction, as well as mild-moderate pericardial effusion.
On discussion with cardiology, it was felt that this was likely due to severe volume depletion at the time of the echocardiogram, and did not necessarily represent an acute change in heart function.
# Hypotension - Likely secondary to hypovolemia complicated by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with outflow tract obstruction as these patients have increased reliance on adequate preload.
The hypotension responded well to fluids and the holding of his diuretics.
# HCC, cirrhosis - His MELD was 25 upon discharge.
CT scan performed during admission showed his known tumors and ascites.
Diagnostic paracentesis on admission was negative for SBP and the patient underwent a therapeutic paracentesis [**3-30**] with 6.5 Liters of fluid removed.
# Anemia - The patient had a hematocrit drop during his admission from a baseline of 30 to 20 and he was transfused 2 units of pRBCs [**3-29**].
He was guaiac negative with no signs of bleeding and his hematocrit stabilized.
Hemolysis was suggested by his lab values and PT/PTT were mildly elevated from baseline.
Peripheral blood smear suggested acanthocytes with no visible schistocytes.
Hematology was consulted, a direct Coombs test was negative, and there was no evidence of TTP-HUS.
It was deemed that this phenomenon was related to his underlying liver disease.
Thrombocytopenia - The patient's platelets decreased by more than half of their baseline down to 45 about 5 days after initiating heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
Constipation - The patient developed constipation during this admission despite administration of lactulose and did not have a bowel movement for several days.
His constipation was associated with RLQ discomfort and tenderness.
TussiCaps 10 mg/8 mg capsules sustained release, [**2-2**] capsules by mouth as needed for cough.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Hyponatremia Hypovolemia Anemia of chronic disease  Secondary diagnoses: -Cryptogenic cirrhosis -Hepatocellular Carcinoma -CAD -Pancreatic cystic mass of unknown etiology -Reactive PPD with positive quantiferon gold -HTN -Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 **] Hospital for evaluation of increased weakness and fatigue.
You were found to have a low blood pressure because of dehydration as well as a low level of sodium in your blood which likely was causing your symptoms.
You were given IV fluids to improve your dehydration, your home blood pressure medications have been changed to make sure that your blood pressure remains stable at home, and your sodium level has improved dramatically.
You were also found to be anemic and required a blood transfusion.
