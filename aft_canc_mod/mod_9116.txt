Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 5950**] Intensive Care Unit for further management after the patient was started to have fevers with rigors.
The patient was given 5 mg of intravenous Lopressor and Diltiazem times two with no sustained effect.
He was felt to be in rapid atrial fibrillation.
He had been having increasing confusion on the bone marrow transplant service and had cut his intravenous lines with some blood dripping onto the floor.
His HEENT was notable for oral ulcers whitish plaques on his tongue with diffuse erythema on mucous membranes.
Cardiovascular rapid irregular heart rate.
Respiratory examination was coarse breath sounds on left mid lung field, decreased breath sounds at the right base.
He had some papular erythematous rash on his back.
His sputum culture was notable for staph aureus 2+.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This 44 year-old male with [**Location (un) 6913**] chromosome positive ALL status post BMT [**2140-3-2**] with a clinical course complicated by febrile neutropenia and Mucositis with confusion associated with question of PCA Dilaudid for pain related to mucositis with episode of rigors prior to transfer was admitted for further observation.
Possible etiologies of his rapid atrial fibrillation included his fevers, possible underlying lung infection, thyrotoxicosis possibly medication related or less likely a structure abnormalities from his Cytoxan related dilated cardiomyopathy or Daunorubicin associated cardiac toxicity.
The patient was started on a Diltiazem drip for management of his rapid atrial fibrillation.
A chest x-ray was done, which showed no evidence of an acute intrapulmonary process.
He had a cardiac echocardiogram to evaluate his ejection fraction and possible dilated cardiomyopathy.
The echocardiogram showed mild symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of 55%, overall normal function.
The left atrium was mildly dilated.
There were no other structural abnormalities noted.
No pericardial effusion.
It was felt that the ............ medication could be contributing to his atrial fibrillation, however, it was likely his acute illness.
He was continued on immunosuppression for possible graft versus host disease.
Given the elevated bilirubinemia and the faint rash on his back as well as stomach complaints and worsening renal function, graft versus host disease was monitored very closely.
His blood cultures were followed and were no growth.
The Dilaudid PCA was stopped and he was placed on morphine for pain control.
He became increasingly agitated and disoriented in the Intensive Care Unit.
On Intensive Care Unit day number three the patient had to be emergently intubated for agitation and decreased oxygen saturation.
It was felt the patient had some mucous plugging, which caused him to be acutely hypoxic requiring intubation.
A bronchoscopy was done at the time of intubation, which showed a mucous plug, but no other obvious abnormalities.
It was negative for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, which had been in the differential given this patient with status post recent bone marrow transplant.
He did have some mild agitation, which was treated with Haldol and morphine.
Acute renal failure:  During his stay in the Intensive Care Unit the patient developed some acute renal failure.
The Renal Service was consulted for assistance with management of the renal failure.
There was some concern that this could be possible to a prerenal state versus Cyclosporin or Ambazone toxicity.
There was some concern it was a toxic metabolic state secondary to steroids, Cyclosporin or central nervous system involvement from his lymphoma.
There had been some discussion of getting a diagnostic lumbar puncture, though this had been done repeatedly by the bone marrow transplant service prior to transfer to the Intensive Care Unit and there was no central nervous system involvement in the cerebral spinal fluid.
In addition, the patient had to be transfused multiple bags of platelets given that he had some thrombocytopenia from his bone marrow suppression prior to having a lumbar puncture done.
