During the last admission, the patient had colonoscopy on [**2140-5-17**] showing fresh blood in the left colon up to 50 cm with extensive diverticulosis.
She had packed red blood cells again on [**2140-5-16**] showing active bleeding at the distal transverse colon proximal to the splenic flexure and then in angio, which was unable to visualize active bleeding.
On the morning of admission, the patient had 3 episodes of passing clots (greater than size of a quarter).
