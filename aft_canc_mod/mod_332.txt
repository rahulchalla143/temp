The patient developed dyspnea and abdominal distension in early [**Month (only) 116**], and was found to have pleural effusions, ascites, and omental caking.
Cytology showed malignant cells.
She also notes diffuse burning/achiness with nausea since yesterday.
Exam notable for decreased breath sounds in left lung field, and abdominal distension.
CXR shows large left pleural effusion.
Bedside U/S showed no pericardial effusion.
CTA chest was without PE, but noted ground glass opacities in the left upper lobe representing early pneumonia or asymmetric pulmonary edema.

ACTIVE ISSUES: # Hypoxia with dyspnea: Pt was admitted with hypoxia and dyspnea, likely related to pleural effusions and ascites.
She underwent a thoracentesis on day of admission with 1.5-2L of serosanguinous fluid removed.
Cell count and chemistries revealed and transudative exudate with 84% "other" cells, concerning for malignancy.
# Ascites: Pt presented with complaints of abdominal distension.
She has required 1 therapeutic paracentesis in the past, with cytology positive for malignancy.
Her current ascites was thought to be due to metastatic disease.
She underwent a therapeutic paracentesis during this admission, with ~3 liters of fluid removed.
# Stage 4 Ovarian Cancer: Likely cause of patient's effusions, though cytology was still pending at time of discharge.
She will also discuss possible pleurex catheter if her ascites/pleural effusions continue to re accumulate despite chemotherapy treatment.
# Neuropathic pain: Pt complained of total body pain and diffuse burning, which was new since starting chemotherapy.
She was also discharged with a short prescription for Dilaudid, pending titration of her gabapentin.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued simvastatin  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: Pt had thoracentesis with pleural cultures and cytology pending at time of discharge.
She will need to follow up in pleural clinic for evaluation for re-accumulation of pleural fluid.
Medications on Admission: anastrazole 1 mg daily (stopped a month ago) -enalapril 20 mg daily -lorazepam 0.5 mg 1-2tabs Q8HRs -ondansetron 8 mg Q8H PRN nausea -simvastatin 30 mg daily -calcium-vitamin D -chemotherapy with taxol/carboplatin   Discharge Medications: 1. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day).
Disp:*90 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Ovarian cancer with malignant ascites and pleural effusions  SECONDARY: hypertension hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted for shortness of breath and abdominal distension.
You were found to have fluid around the lungs (pleural effusion) and fluid in the abdomen (ascites).
This fluid accumulation is likely due to your cancer.
# START gabapentin 300 mg every 8 hours # START dilaudid 2 mg every 6 hours as needed for pain  Continue all other medications as prescribed.
