Admission Date:  [**2132-1-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-1-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2057-5-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Codeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3227**] Chief Complaint: Lethargy   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**1-3**]: Placement of External Ventricular Drain [**1-11**]: Endoscopic Biopsy   History of Present Illness: 74 y/o female brought to [**Hospital3 7362**] by her co-workers for lethargy; Patient was falling asleep at work and difficult to arrouse; CT there showed a third ventricular tumor with hydrocephalus.
Past Medical History: Unknown   Social History: non-contributory  Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: BP:  116/56    HR:70's    R 12     O2Sats 97% Gen: Grimicing, shaking head from side to side HEENT: Pupils: R: 6mm and hippus 6mm to 4mm brisk     EOMs: Exam limited secondary to lethargy and poor mental status.
Interventricular mass in the left lateral ventricle appearing to arise from the roof of the third ventricle causing obstruction of the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**] with subsequent hydrocephalus.
Diagnostic consideration include ependymoma or intraventricular meningioma.
If there is a history of tuberous sclerosis, then a giant cell astrocytoma could be considered.
CXR [**1-2**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
CSF Sample [**1-3**]: Cerebrospinal fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Multiple attempts did not significantly improve motion artifact due to patient's inability to hold still.
Within the limitations of the study, there is a T1 hypointense lobulated intraventricular mass involving the left lateral ventricle and measuring 1.8 x 1.4 cm.
There are no other obvious lesions, masses on pre- contrastr T1- weighted images.
Within these limitations, the well visualized portions of the intracranial internal carotid arteries, the anterior and the middle cerebral and the distal vertebral and the basilar artery, appear to be grossly patent, without focal flow-limiting stenosis or occlusion.
On the axial T2-weighted images, there is increased signal in the maxillary sinuses, and ethmoid air cells on both sides from fluid and/or mucosal thickening along with retention cysts or polyps in the maxillary sinus, the largest one in the left maxillary sinus measuring approximately 2.5 x 1.7 cm.
No axillary, mediastinal, or hilar adenopathy is detected per CT size criteria.
Small lymph nodes are present within the mediastinum.
No dissection flap is present within the thoracic aorta.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Coronary artery calcifications are present.
Bibasilar atelectasis is noted within the lungs.
A subpleural nodular density measuring 1 cm is noted in the lateral right upper lobe  CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: No masses are identified within the liver.
The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.
No free fluid or free air is present within the abdomen.
Incidental note is made of a retroaortic left renal vein.
Calcified atherosclerotic plaque is present within the abdominal aorta and iliac branches without aneurysmal dilatation.
The rectum, sigmoid colon, and unopacified loops of small bowel appear unremarkable without evidence of obstruction.
No lymphadenopathy is detected.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are detected.
Moderate degenerative changes are present within the lower lumbar spine with facet joint sclerosis.
CT w/3D rendering [**1-11**]: FINDINGS: There have been no significant changes since the prior study.
Again identified is a mass arising within the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
No other abnormalities are detected.
The tumor volume measures 1.4 cc on the axial short TR images.
This appears to arise from the choroid plexus, and thus choroid plexus-origin tumors such as meningioma or papilloma appear to be the most likely diagnoses.
Head CT [**1-11**]: FINDINGS: There is diffuse increased edema with blurring of the sulci and complete effacement of the basal cisterns, which is very concerning for impending transtentorial herniation.
There is a 5-mm shift of normally midline structures which is grossly unchanged since [**2132-1-11**].
There are scattered opacifications in the paranasal sinuses, which are unchanged since [**2132-1-4**].
There is complete effacement of the basal cisterns which is concerning for impending transtentorial herniation.
There is diffuse brain edema, which has markedly increased since [**2132-1-11**].
High-density fluid in the left lateral ventricle likely represents contrast, although evaluation for underlying hemorrhage is limited.
However, complete obliteration of the quadrigeminal cistern and deformity of the mid brain are suggestive of central herniation.
The initial CT there showed a third ventricular tumor with hydrocephalus.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin, Ampicillin, and Ceftriaxone) pending isolation of sensitive organism.
On [**1-8**] an additional CSF sample was sent which showed no isolated WBC/leukocytes and CSF had RBC of 900 and WBC of 0.
She was also found to have a bump in her LFT's but given the mild elevation, ID opted to continue to monitor daily.
This was attributed to recovery from anesthesia in the setting of a stable head CT.  On [**1-13**] her examination was much improved and following commands very briskly.
At this point she had been on antibiotics for 13 days, and ID felt very comfortable discontinuing further treatment in the setting of no WBC in the most recent CSF sampling.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**8-2**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your sutures and a wound check.
