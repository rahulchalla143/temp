[**2-15**]: MSSA [**2134-2-17**] negative [**2039-2-21**], pending  Pathology: [**2133-2-20**] bone marrow biopsy (preliminary): extensive metastatic melanoma; no hemosiderin-laden macrophages suggestive of hemophagocytosis  Studies: CXR [**2133-2-12**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest read in conjunction with CT scan of the chest, [**2-9**]: Nearly cm rounded opacity in the left mid lung has developed from what was previously a 2-cm wide opacity with surrounding hemorrhage in the lingula on the chest CT performed [**2-9**].
The CT also shows patient has had a wedge biopsy from the left lower lobe and has a small non-serous fluid collection in the left major fissure.
Differential diagnosis of the lingular lesion includes abscess or aggressive tumor.
Renal u/s [**2133-2-12**]: IMPRESSION:  No definite renal mass lesion identified.
No hydronephrosis or calculus.
A roughly 5-cm wide lesion at the lateral periphery of the left mid lung and a smaller lesion just inferior to it developed between [**2131-8-9**] and [**2-12**].
Differential diagnosis is broad and includes pneumonia, malignancy, and infarction.
Pleural effusion is small on the left, if any.
Note is made of at least moderately severe intestinal distention in the upper abdomen.
Diffuse infiltrative bone marrow disease, suspicious for metastases.
Intramuscular hematomas of the right iliopsoas and obturator internus muscles.
A soft tissue metastatic focus within these muscles is not entirely excluded.
[**2133-2-16**] Radiology UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US, right upper extremity No evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
[**2133-2-17**] Radiology PORTABLE ABDOMEN XR FINDINGS: Upright views of the abdomen demonstrate multiple dilated air-filled loops of large bowel, compatible with colonic ileus.
No pneumatosis or pneumoperitoneum.
No radiopaque foreign bodies.
IMPRESSION: Worsening colonic ileus.
1.4 cm simple cyst unchanged from the prior examination.
[**2133-2-17**] Radiology UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS - No evidence of DVT in right lower extremity veins.
Reidentified is thickening of the right iliacus and right internal obturator muscles, compatible with the patient's known hematoma, no gross change is seen from prior MR examination from [**2133-2-15**].
New left nonhemorrhagic pleural effusion.
New ground-glass opacities are seen in the lungs as described.
New pericardial effusion.
[**2133-2-20**] Cardiovascular ECHO The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis or definite vegetation, though a very small (~2-3mm) mobile echodensity on the non-coronary leaflet of the aortic valve is suggested in one view (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **], ?74) c/w a possible vegetation vs focal calcification.
No aortic stenosis is present.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Aortic valve sclerosis with trace aortic regurgitation.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved regional and hyperdynamic global biventricular systolic function.
If the clinical suspicion for endocarditis is moderate or high, a TEE is suggested.
[**2133-2-26**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Right upper lobe consolidation has minimally improved.
Left lower lobe opacities are unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: Brief Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1319**] is a 63 year old male with metastatic melanoma (V600E B-Raf mutant) who has been partially responsive to experimental treatment, who presented to the ICU with spontaneous bleeding, hematuria, and DIC.
His course was complicated most notably by renal failure requiring dialysis.
In the end, he and his wife decided to not continue to pursue aggressive measures, given the grim prognosis for his metastatic melanoma.
# DIC: Labs on admission consistent with DIC-- thrombocytopenia, anemia, low fibrinogen, elevated INR/PT, high D-dimer and fibrin degradation products.
Smear on admission was negative for schistocytes, no evidence of TTP.
Etiology thought to be likely his widely metastatic melanoma, especially now that there are new foci of metastatsis and bone marrow infiltration.
No signs of sepsis/infection intially(afebrile, WBC 10.9, no bandemia or left shift, no symptoms of infection).
Did develop transient MSSA bacteremia (likely from infected EJ peripheral IV), however this was placed after initially presentation and therefor unlikely to be precipitant of DIC.
Within the first few days of his stay, his DIC seemed to improve with decreasing transfusion requirements, however he continued to have ongoing anemia requiring frequent blood transfusions.
Etiology seemed to be consistent with blood loss anemia through his GU tract (see "hematuria" below) as well as bleeding/hematomas in his thighs seen on CT and MRI scans.
Also question some degree of pulmonary hemorrhage surrounding lung nodule in left lower lobe.
Labs were also suggestive of hemolysis with decreasing haptoglobin and elevated LDH.
Hematology was consulted and felt that hemolysis was unlikely, with his elevated LDH due to his metastatic melanoma and haptoglobin falsely lowered by multiple transfusions.
Repeat blood smear showed some nucleated red cells and giant platelets, but few schistocytes.
Bone marrow biopsy on [**2-20**] showed extensive melanoma, with no evidence of hemophagocytosis (ferritin 4000).
Urology was also consulted for continued hematuria (see below).
# Hematuria:  One of his chief complaints on presentation, likely due to mucosal bleeding from coagulopathy as above.
CT scan on admission did not show any reason for bleeding, only small foci of parenchymal hemorrhage in the kidneys.
This was complicated by frequent clotting and urinary retention.
Urology was consulted and suggested frequent hand irrigation, however he continued to have frequent clots requiring foley changes.
At this time he also developed renal failure (see below), so renal US was obtained, and there was no evidence of clot causing obstructive hydronephrosis.
Unfortunately, Pt could not be weaned off CBI, and he continued to have significant anemia and hematuria.
Pt was offered a cystoscopy and clot evacuation procedure to help reduce the bleeding and clot burden, which was causing significant discomfort for the patient when passed during bladder irrigation.
Per urology, CBI would be more comfortable than removing the foley and having potential clots.
His manual foley irrigation was reduced to the minimum possible to prevent complete obstruction / clots.
Renal US did not show clot causing obstruction and hydronephrosis.
Renal service was consulted and felt this may have been due to pigment-induced acute renal failure due to intravascular hemolysis.
# Metastatic Melanoma: Pt has finished cycle 6 of experiment MEK inhibitor therapy and was in-between cycles on admission.
Upon imaging, he appeared to have diffuse progressive disease.
Pelvic MRI showed diffuse marrow infiltration, new mass in iliacus muscle that may represent another met.
Bone marrow biopsy on [**2133-2-20**] showed very extensive infiltration of his bone marrow with melanoma.
# Fevers / MSSA bacteremia:  Pt was febrile on [**2-15**] and blood cultures later revealed MSSA, thought to be due to infected L EJ IV site which was purulent and also grew MSSA.
However, Pt had a CT abdomen, which showed a possible RUL pneumonia, and antibiotics were switched to vancomycin and cefepime.
ID was consulted and also recommended TTE for worsening heart murmur.
TTE showed a possible 2mm lesion on the aortic valve but no significant regurg or stenosis of any valve and hyperdynamic LV activity.
Several surveillance blood and urine cultures were negative afterwards, but the Pt did become mildly febrile on [**2-23**]-18.
# Abdominal pain/distension and R hip pain:  Initially though most likely secondary to constipation vs. ileus vs. pain from bleeding into soft tissues.
Pt had minimal bowel movements, and continued to have pain.
Small progress was made with enemas and bowel regimen.
Given metatstatic disease, MRI pelvis was ordered, which showed diffuse infiltration of the bone marrow with metastatic disease, and enlargement of the right iliacus and the right internal obturator muscles, which appears to be due to bleeding.
Abdominal pain possibly related to these findings.
Given persistent and worsening pain, CT abd/pelvis again obtained which showed hematoma of right iliacus muscle, likely contributing to worsened belly and back pain, but no significant enlargement relative to prior.
Pt had intermittent abdominal pain that was not related to bowel movement.
His pain improved once his medication regimen was liberalized after transition to comfort care.
# Altered mental status:  Days into admission, patient was became intermittently altered and somnolent which was attributed to his narcotics.
Pt's mental status later waned w/ worsening renal function and was attributed to a combination of his obstructive sleep apnea and worsening uremia.
Pt was found to be hypercarbic on VBG.
# Hypertension:  Pt was intermittently hypertensive to 150s, started metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] with improvement in BPs, but this was later discontinued.
