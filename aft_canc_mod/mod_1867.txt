Past Medical History: PMH: locally advanced rectal cancer w/ liver mets, viral cardiomyopathy EF 30%, A.fib on coumadin, multiple episdoes of V.fib s/p ICD firing  PSH: Early stage urothelial carcinoma of the bladder status post cystoscopic resection on [**2116-1-30**]   Social History: Primarily Italian-speaking.
Mother: Lived to 94 and was healthy with no known cancers.
CVS: Regular rate and rhythm, without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
RESP: Clear to auscultation bilaterally without adventitious sounds, minimally decreased breath sounds at bases bilaterally.
No wheezing, rhonchi or crackles.
No masses or peritoneal signs.
Left sided colostomy stoma is pink-purple, protuberant with mild friability and is healing well with liquid-brown/green stool output and gas in his ostomy appliance.
EXTR: 2+ peripheral pulses, without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
INCISION/WOUND: Midline abdominal incision has mild erythema extending 1-2 cm from the wound edge without fluctuance, purulence or induration.
[**4-17**] staples have been removed with granulating tissue and minimally serosanginous drainage underlying the exposed superficial fascia.
The wound appears clean.
LUE US ([**2116-5-2**]) - No evidence of left upper extremity deep venous thrombus.
Pathology ([**2116-4-29**]) - Rectum and sigmoid colon: Two synchronous colonic adenocarcinomas.
Thirty-five lymph nodes; no malignancy identified.
Brief Hospital Course: NEURO/PAIN: The patient was maintained on PCA/IV Morphine for pain medication in the immediate post-operative period and transitioned to PO narcotic medication with adequate pain control on POD#[**6-19**].
CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient experienced a  single episode of what was suspected ventricular tachycardia and his AICD fired a single time intra-operatively, as previously mentioned.
The procedure progressed without further hemodynamic or arrhythmic issues and he was transferred to ICU in stable condition, intubated.
Serial EKGs were closely monitored without issue.
He was transitioned to oral Metoprolol, continued his dofetilide, and started Digoxin with resolve of cardiac issues by POD#4.
The patient had no episodes of desaturation.
The patient denied cough or respiratory symptoms.
serial CXRs did reveal some evidence of atelectasis versus consolidation, along with pleural effusions (improved with diuresis) which was closely monitored.
A sputum sample revealed H. influenzae (non type-B) that was sensitive to Ampicillin.
Given diurnal temperature spikes and the respiratory source of infection, empiric Vancomycin and Zosyn IV were started on POD#2.
The patient experienced no nausea or vomiting.
His ostomy site began functioning with liquid stool output and gas in the appliance on POD# [**5-19**].
His stoma site appeared dusky and friable with some edema that progressed post-op, but was cloesly monitored and deemed clinically stable.
The patient had no evidence of bleeding from their incision.
ID: The patient was febrile immediately post-op and displayed a nearly diurnal fever curve, the source likely being a sputum sample which revealed H. influenzae (non type-B) that was sensitive to Ampicillin.
Given diurnal temperature spikes and the respiratory source of infection, empiric Vancomycin and Zosyn IV were started on POD#2.
Their white count was stable post-operatively and their incision was closely monitored for any evidence of infection or erythema.
Staples were removed from the superior aspect of the incision on POD#5 given some spreading peri-incisional erythema, and green-brown purulence was expressed and cultured.
There was no induration, fluctuance.
Wound cultures demonstrated pan-sensitive pseudomonas and he has been on oral ciprofloxacin, which will continue until [**5-16**].
The patient also had sequential compression boot devices in place during immobilization to promote circulation.
Discharge Medications: 1. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
During this procedure a patch was also placed to prevent you from developing a hernia near your colostomy site.
You developed pneumonia during your hospitalization and this has been treated with broad spectrum antibiotics.
You will continue antibiotics by mouth as an outpatient for the wound on your abdomen.
You have tolerated a regular diet, passing gas and your pain is controlled with pain medications by mouth.
Monitor your bowel function closely, if you have any of the following symptoms please call the office for advice or go to the emergency room if severe: increasing abdominal distension, increasing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, inability to tolerate food or liquids, prolonges loose stool, or constipation.
You may take an over the counter stool softener such as colace if you find that you are becoming constipated from narcotic pain medications.
Please watch the appearance of the stoma, your stoma has become darker purple/bluish/slightly yellow which is from some compromised blood flow after your procedure, occationally this happens with stomas and we watch the stoma for improvement which yours has shown.
The skin around the ostomy site should be kept clean and intact.
Monitor the skin around the stoma for buldging or signs of infection listed above.
You have a long vertical incision on your abdomen that is partially  closed with staples.
The incision had a small area of infection , and was opened at the bedside.
It is important to monitor the wound for signs of infection listed below.
You will take antibiotics that will help treat infection inthe area and allow the wound to heal.
Please monitor the incision for signs and symptoms of infection including: increasing redness at the incision, opening of the incision, increased pain at the incision line, draining of white/green/yellow/foul smelling drainage, or if you develop a fever.
Please call the office if you develop these symptoms or go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe.
You may shower, let the warm water run over the incision line/ wound and pat the area dry with a towel, do not rub.
You will be prescribed a small amount of the pain medication oxycodone.
