GIB:  Pt was admitted with acute GI bleeding.
He got a total of 5 units of PRBC's and 1 unit FFP for his supratherapeutic INR.
EGD in the MICU revealed short segement of Barrett's esophagus, non-erosive gastritis and non-bleeding dudenal polyps.
Therefore, Mr.[**Known lastname **] cause of bleeding was likely supratheraputic anticoagulation from an unknown site.
He is no longer bleeding and his hematocrit is stable.
NSTEMI:  Pt had evidence of AMI with troponin leak in setting of acute hemmorhage.
Pt is paced, so it is impossible to definitively rule out acute STEMI, but his serial ekg's did not meet sgarbosa's criteria.
However, his history is not suggestive of acute coronary syndrome.
He was maintained on asprin and plavix (even in setting of acute GIB) to prevent acute in-stent thrombosis.
No evidence of DKA.
No evidency of acute gouty flare.
