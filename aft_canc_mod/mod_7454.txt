He denies any BRBPR or melanotic bowel movements.
He denies fever, chills, shortness of breath or chest pain.
He also denies hx SBP, varices or hepatic encephalopathy.
In the ED labs were significant for a BUN/Cr of 83/4.0 (apparently at baseline), Hct of 22.7 (taken during blood transfusion) with guaiac positive brown stool.
On arrival to the MICU, pt is still having nausea and emesis, but says that his abdominal pain has improved since receiving pain medications in the ED.

CXR (AP) [**2178-2-15**] FINDINGS: There is a moderate-sized right pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax is detected.
Aortic calcification is noted.
Cirrhotic liver with a large mass residing along the inferior right hepatic lobe, most likely representing hepatoma, although not fully characterized on non-contrast imaging.
Complex free fluid within the abdomen with the highest density noted in the region of the suspected liver mass is consistent with extensive peritoneal hemorrhage suspected to reflect bleeding from a large hepatoma.
Small hiatal hernia.
[**2178-2-20**] KUB FINDINGS: Supine and left lateral decubitus frontal views of the abdomen demonstrate gas in multiple non-dilated loops of small and large bowel.
No free air is detected.
Degenerative changes are noted in the lumbar spine with bridging osteophytes.
Degenerative changes also noted in the bilateral femoroacetabular joints.
IMPRESSION: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with no evidence of obstruction or free air.
ECG [**2178-2-15**] Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature beats.
Atrio-ventricular conduction delay and diffuse non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Common hepatic arteriogram demonstrated right and left hepatic arterial branches, GDA and cystic arteries.
In addition, multiple abnormal vessels are noted in the region of multiple foci of tumor blush in the right hepatic lobe.
No active extravasation or pseudoaneurysm seen.
Selective third/fourth order branches arising from the right hepatic lobe confirmed the anatomy and presence of tumor blush in their territories.
Celiac arteriogram demonstrated significantly diminished flow to the right hepatic artery, with normal flow into the splenic, left gastric, left hepatic and gastroduodenal arteries.
Brief Hospital Course: 72M w/hx alcoholic cirrhosis & multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma who initially presented to OSH with sharp, sudden-onset right-sided abdominal pain and distention, found to have hemoperitoneum and Hct 17.
Hospital course was notable for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU and eventual stabilization of bleeding after transfusion of 6 units of packed red cells and CT-guided gel foam embolization of hepatic artery branches.
# MULTIFOCAL HCC [**12-25**] ALCOHOLIC CIRRHOSIS complicated by hemoperitoneum: Patient is followed by outpatient oncologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital3 **].
Patient underwent cyberknife treatment here at [**Hospital1 18**] approximately 1 year ago & had been receiving sorafenib until recently when it was discontinued because of intractable nausea and vomiting.
In the setting of his acute HCC bleed (see below) and lack of remaining therapeutic options, palliative care discussions were held w/patient and family.
#HEMOPERITONEUM FROM BLEEDING RIGHT LOBE HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA LESION: Pt was admitted to [**Hospital3 7571**]ICU with sudden-onset severe abdominal pain, distension, and blood loss anemia with Hct 17 and CT-demonstrated hemoperitoneum from bleeding R lobe hepatoma.
IR and transplant surgery were both consulted to consider interventional options for hemostasis.
Pain acutely worsened on [**2-18**], prompting additional 2 unit PRBC transfusion (for 6U total) and CT-guided embolization of 3 branches of his hepatic artery feeding his R hepatic lobe (where the offending HCC lesion was located).
#HYPERTENSIVE URGENCY Pt has hx hypertension but outpatient antihypertensive regimen unclear - had been previously prescribed labetolol, hydralazine and amlodipine but only script filled within past 5 months was amlodipine.
When admitted he was found to have severe (asymptomatic) hypertension to SBP 190s-200s.
There was some difficulty controlling BPs again when pt could not tolerate POs due to nausea/vomiting, was also likely exacerbated by underlying nausea and abdominal discomfort.
Blood pressures were ultimately better controlled after achieving better control of pain and nausea and hydralazine was successfully weaned and labetolol dose decreased after pt started on home amlodipine 10 mg QD plus PRN ativan.
# CONSTIPATION Pt had constipation on admission.
KUB prior to discharge showed gas throughout bowel, no evidence of obstruction or stool load.
# THROMBOCYTOPENIA Plts 260 on admission, dropped to a nadir of 88 then rose to within historical baseline ~150.
Chronically low baseline Plts expected in liver failure; further acute thrombocytopenia could be explained by bleeding/clotting (consumption) and/or DIC.
Labs and blood smear showed no evidence for hemolysis.
On HD3 he developed a tender swollen L knee.
Rheumatology consulted but did not perform joint aspiration or intra-articular steroid injection because patient refused given severity of other medical problems.
[**Name (NI) 35632**] pain controlled w/tylenol + PRN oxycodone.
# HX CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE During his MICU stay he was without evidence of fluid overload of CHF exacerbation.
# HX DIABETES [**Name (NI) **] Pt prescribed glyburide as an outpt but script not filled in several months.
