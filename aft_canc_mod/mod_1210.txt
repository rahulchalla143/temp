Admission Date:  [**2142-8-30**]       Discharge Date:  [**2142-9-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2071-12-30**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CT Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 34164**] is a 70 year old male with no cardiac history prior to [**2138-7-29**], when he had an acute myocardial infarction while on a hunting trip in [**State 1727**].
An echocardiogram at that time showed inferior and posterior as well as basal and septal ischemia and he was referred for cardiac catheterization.
The patient did well after the intervention and was scheduled for an elective knee surgery in [**2141-1-26**] but, before his surgery, he began to develop symptoms of chest discomfort.
He consequently underwent another cardiac catheterization in [**2140-12-29**], which showed branch vessel coronary artery disease, mild mitral regurgitation and mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction with an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%.
The patient is active daily.
For the past few months prior to admission, he noticed increasing mild chest burning when he is exerting himself.
He did experience chest discomfort with exercise, but his electrocardiogram was nondiagnostic.
Imaging at the time revealed a mild fixed inferior defect but no areas of ischemia, with an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 45%.
Given the increasing symptoms of chest pain on exertion, the patient underwent another cardiac catheterization prior to admission, on [**2142-8-30**].
This cardiac catheterization showed three vessel disease and left main coronary artery disease with normal left ventricular function and moderate diastolic dysfunction.
Specifically, the left main coronary artery showed a 70% to 75% stenosis of the distal segment.
The left anterior descending artery showed a 50% proximal stenosis and the circumflex artery had minimal irregularities without significant flow limited lesions.
The right coronary system had a 30% stenosis of the proximal segment.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denied any symptoms of orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, claudication, edema or lightheadedness.
Diabetes mellitus.
Myocardial infarction in [**2138-7-29**], treated with TPA.
Severe degenerative joint disease.
Prostate cancer treated with Lupron.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
He was afebrile with a heart rate of 60, blood pressure 132/72, and oxygen saturation 99% in room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  No bruits, no jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the apex, normal S1 and S2 sounds.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, right groin without hematoma, no oozing, no bruits status post cardiac catheterization.
His last cardiac catheterization performed on the day of admission showed 70% stenosis of the left main, 50% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery and 30% stenosis of the right coronary artery with an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%.
The patient remained in sinus rhythm with occasional premature ventricular contractions.
He was originally put on an insulin drip given his history of diabetes.
On postoperative day number two, the patient had a fever of 101.3.
His chest tube had a small air leak.
He remained afebrile with a stable heart rate and blood pressure and adequate oxygenation.
The patient remained in sinus rhythm without any events.
Diabetes mellitus.
Degenerative joint disease.
