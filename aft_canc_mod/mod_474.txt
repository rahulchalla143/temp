No fevers or chills.
No URI Sx.
Unchanged Nausea and vomiting.
Positive constipation, no diarrhea.
Patient reports that this feels similar to a few years ago when she had pleural effusions requiring a tap.
Her exam was notable for decreased breath sounds on the right.
A chest X-ray confirmed the presence of a large pleural effusion and there was a question of an infiltrate and so the patient was given vanc/cefepime to cover HAP.
She was noted to be tachycardic and so was given 1.5L NS without improvment in her tachycardia.
There was also confern for a pericardial effusion based on her CXR.
A bedside ultrasound revealed what appeared to be a moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of RV collapse.
Patient was transferred to the MICU for further care which included a pericardial drainage.
Past Oncologic History: *per most recent clinic note, with updates* Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented with dyspnea and a pleural effusion in 12/[**2166**].
Pleural fluid cytology was consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
CT showed a moderate amount of intra-abdominal ascites and enhancing nodularity within the peritoneal/omental fat consistent with carcinomatosis/omental caking.
CA-125 was elevated at 909.
On [**2167-12-23**] she underwent a thoracoscopy with pleurodesis, biopsy of the left parietal pleura and right percutaneous drainage of pleural effusion.
There was bulky metastatic disease within the pleural space.
She was optimally debulked and had minimal residual disease.
CT torso in [**6-3**] was notable for a right sided pleural effusion which was malignant based on cytology from thoracentesis on [**2169-7-28**].
She had recurrent pleural effusion and underwent thoracentesis on [**2169-9-14**] and again in [**12-6**].
CT on [**2170-2-14**] showed new mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy as well as markedly increased soft tissue thickening along the right pleura, extending into the anterior mediastinum.
However, she developed rapidly enlarging lymphadenopathy in her neck in 11/[**2169**].
She received D1 and D8 doses, but was neutropenic on D15.
Navelbine was dose reduced to 25mg/m2 during her second cycle, but she again became neutropenic and the D15 dose was held.
Vaginal biopsy on [**2171-2-21**] performed due to vaginal bleeding was notable for metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma.
She completed 4 cycles of gemcitabine until having her dose held on [**2172-1-23**] due to concern of either progression of disease or gemcitabine pulmonary toxicity causing.

AP UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There is increased opacification of the right hemithorax compared to the prior study with faint air bronchograms in the mid and lower right lung.
There is an interval increase in the layering moderate right pleural effusion.
Changes reflect progression of the patient's known metastatic pulmonary and pleural disease.
A superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
There has been interval increase in small-to-moderate left pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax is detected.
Interval increase in the pleural effusions bilaterally.
Increasing pulmonary opacities in the right mid and lower lung, suggest progression of the patient's known pleural and parenchymal metastatic disease.
A superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
IVC Placement [**2172-6-8**]: HISTORY: Peritoneal cancer with pulmonary embolus and slow GI bleed for IVC filter placement.
ANESTHESIA: 1% buffered lidocaine for local anesthesia.
Venogram was performed and demonstrated a single IVC with no filling defects in the infrarenal portion.
The wire and inner dilator were removed and the filter was placed through the sheath and successfully deployed in the infrarenal position.
The sheath was removed and hemostasis achieved with digital compression for 10 minutes.
The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications.
IVC gram with no IVC duplication and no filling defects noted.
CXR [**2172-6-10**] IMPRESSIONS: Pleural effusions remain small.
No pericardial air.
KUB [**2172-6-12**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction or ileus.
Brief Hospital Course: 57 year old F with poorly differentiated primary peritoneal adenocarcimona who is s/p multiple treatment modalities and who presented on [**2172-5-26**] with SOB and cough for 5 days that subsequently improved with pericardiocentesis.
Her hospital course, which now spans nearly one month, has had multiple complications, including bilateral PEs, now s/p IVC stent, Afib with RVR, gastrointestinal bleed, slowly resolving partial bowel obstruction, acute kidney injury, and complicated UTI.
# Pericardial effusion: Large effusion seen on echo which was drained - 650cc bloody fluid; shortness of breath vastly improved following the dranaige in the ICU, and she was transferred to the OMED floor on [**5-29**] as a result.
The fluid had many white blood cells and atypical cells indicating mailignant origin.
Repeat Echo on [**6-2**] showed no significant reaccumulation of pericardial fluid, however showed right heart strain.
# Bilateral PEs: Because of the evidence of right heart strain on Echo, CTA was done to r/o PE's.
On CTA  ([**6-2**]) the patient was found to have bilateral segmental PE's, as a result heparin drip was started after testing stool guiac which was negative.
Heparin was stopped in the setting of guaiac positive stool.
# Pleural effusions:  Bilateral chronic effusions.
Progressive consolidation of the right lung, sparing only the apex and obscuring previous tumor infiltration is probably due to restrictive effects of circumferential right pleural thickening, partially calcified following pleurodesis.
Despite a small residual pericardial effusion, and the indwelling pericardial drain, the small size of the right atrium, if not due to hypovolemia, may indicate constrictive physiology.
Since the patient was symptomatically improved with good oxygen saturations following the pericardiocentesis, it was deduced that the pleural effusions were not a significant contributor to her presenting complaints.
The pleural effusions remained stable throughout the remainder of her hospitalization.
# GI bleed: Downtrending Hct in the setting of blood clots following an enema were concerning for GI bleed.
Aspirin was started for anticoagulation in the setting of Afib as recommended by Cardiology.
# AFib with RVR: The patient triggered on [**6-2**] for heart rate in the 160-170 and found to have atrial fibrillation.
She subsequently had several more episodes of Afib with RVR that were precipitated by sitting up and moving to the cammode; she responded to lopressor pushes.
Cardiology diagnosed her arrhythmia as asymptomatic episodic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, requiring no intervention with antiarrhythmic medications because she spontaneously converts on her own and only gentle rate control.
Due to repeated episodes of asymptomatic tachycardia due to afib, she was taken off of telemetry monitoring per cardiology.
# Partial bowel obstruction: Over the course of the hospitalization, she developed a partial bowel obstruction - presenting with a tense, tender abdomen, abdominal pain, and nausea.
GI was consulted who diagnosed the partial obstruction and bleeding as being due to invasion of the colonic wall by her cancer.
A KUB was obtained, which ruled out perforation and showed significant constipation.
Supportive laxatives were given orally and rectally daily, but to no significant avail.
She continues to tolerate a conservative full clear liquid diet without any abdominal pain or nausea.
# Anemia: Was transfused 2 units [**6-1**] in effort to increase hemoglobin in the setting of sinus tachycardia and blood clots per rectum.
# Bacteremia: The patient had gram positive cocci growing in clusters, coagulase negative which grew in her blood from culture sample taken from her port on [**6-2**].
Most probably a contaminant since the patient had no leukocytosis, fevers, or other clinical signs of an infection.
No signs of infection at her port either.
This bacteremia could be caused by infected port even though the port site does not have any erythema or fluctuation.
It also could still be contamination because of no clinical signs of fever or leukocytosis.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Developed elevated creatinine suggestive of pre-renal [**Last Name (un) **], which resolved to her baseline with supportive IVF.
# Complicated UTI: Developed a UTI in the setting of a recent indwelling urinary catheter.
# Peritoneal carcinoma: Failed multiple treatments including two cycles of alimta.

You were brought to the hospital because of worsening shortness of breath.
Several imaging studies showed fluid around your heart.
This fluid was successfully drained without complication and your diffuculty breathing improved.
Radiographic imaging also showed fluid accumulating in your chest cavity, known as pleural effusions.
These fluid collections remained stable and were not thought to be contributing significantly to your shortness of breath because your symptoms improved after draining fluid from  around your heart.
Due to the risk of bleeding presented by increasing the anticoagulation medication in the setting of a suspected gastrointestinal bleed, the decision was made to place a filter in your inferior vena cava instead - the inferior vena cava is a major vein feeding blood into the heart.
Cardiology specialists saw you in the hospital and diagnosed your heart rhythm as intermittent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which is a rhythm that often causes patients who have it no symptoms and which corrects itself.
Given this diagnosis and that you experienced no symptoms from the rhythm, we stopped 24h monitoring of your heart based on the recommendations of our cardiac colleagues.
Due, in part, to your progressive peritoneal cancer, you developed a partial bowel obstruction during this hospitalization.
Radiographic imaging showed no evidence of a complete bowel obstruction or evidence of a hole in your bowel, but did show that you were quite backed up with stool.
In addition, you had several episodes of abdominal pain without associated nausea, which were partially relieved with IV and oral morphine.
During this hospitalization, your kidneys showed temporary signs of dehydration, but this resolved with intravenous fluid.
You were also found to have a suspected urinary tract infection, which was treated with oral antibiotics.
