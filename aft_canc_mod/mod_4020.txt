DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Esophageal adenocarcinoma - status post esophagogastrectomy.
Status post feeding jejunostomy.
Urinary tract infection.
ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 year old man who was seen in the Thoracic [**Hospital **] Clinic for evaluation of his esophageal adenocarcinoma which was found after he had initially presented in late [**2177-11-15**] with emesis and pancreatitis which were thought to be related to alcohol abuse.
At the time, he underwent an EGD which showed Grade 4 ulcerative esophagitis with severe dysplasia.
He was managed conservatively with medication but follow-up EGDs showed Barrett's type changes which eventually were found to have a small focus of adenocarcinoma at 30 cm.
Given the extent of his disease, in the clinic it was felt that he would be a good candidate for esophagogastrectomy without need for adjuvant therapy.
On his initial examination, he was in no acute distress.
He had no scleral icterus.
He had no cervical adenopathy.
There were no supraclavicular or thyroid masses.
Heart was regular without rub or murmur.
The abdomen was soft and flat.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly or ascites.
The extremities had no edema or clubbing and he had no axillary or groin adenopathy.
His PET-CT scan demonstrated a small focus of FDG uptake in the mid esophagus without any evidence of distant metastasis.
There was no note of intraoperative complication or excessive blood loss and the patient underwent a total esophagectomy which was thoracoscopically and laparoscopically assisted with an esophagoscopy and jejunostomy placement by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] and by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
The patient tolerated the procedure well without note of excessive blood loss or intraoperative complication.
From a neurologic point of view, the patient's main issue was his history of significant alcoholism for which there is significant concern for experiencing delirium tremens.
Therefore, postoperatively, he was managed aggressively with intravenous benzodiazepine (Ativan) for prophylaxis against delirium tremens.
This regiment worked out well for him and the patient never really seemed to suffer any adverse symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.
Otherwise, his pain was initially managed with an epidural catheter and subsequently he was switched over to IV narcotics.
The reasons for failure of extubation seemed to be related to some mild laryngeal edema of which the etiology is unclear but the patient was breathing well without need for supplemental oxygenation.
At the time of discharged, he had saturations in the high 90 percent.
Otherwise, the patient had no other respiratory problems.
From a GI perspective, the patient was felt to do well in the initial postoperative period but during the first postoperative week, he developed a fever and there was a concern that there may be a small esophageal leak.
This was managed conservatively with broad spectrum antibiotics and the patient actually did undergo an esophagoscopy which did not evidence any visible leak and the anastomosis looked good during the esophagoscopy.
He was given heparin subcu along with Venodyne boots for DVT prophylaxis.
The wound was thoroughly inspected and no focus of infection could ever be found.
Eventually, search for an infectious source led to CT scan of the neck, chest and abdomen which again showed no evidence of abscess or any sort of fluid collection.
There was a question of trace gallbladder wall thickening but the patient's LFTs were checked and these were all normal and he otherwise had no subjective complaints and no findings of pain on physical examination.
Therefore, this was not felt to likely be the source, but during the patient's second and third postoperative week, he remained essentially afebrile although he did still have moderate leukocytosis with a white count of 20 and 0 bands.
At the time of discharge, it is felt that there was no source of infection and he had adequately been treated and therefore his antibiotics were stopped.
Otherwise, his only infectious complication postoperatively was a urinary tract infection which was covered with the vancomycin and levofloxacin.
It was felt that by postoperative day 21 that as the patient had adequate pain control with PO medications, was otherwise stable from a respiratory perspective, had no cardiac issues and was otherwise obtaining adequate caloric nutrition with his tube feeds and was beginning to take PO's and otherwise had been afebrile, that he could be discharged to a rehab facility in fair condition with follow-up in two weeks.
