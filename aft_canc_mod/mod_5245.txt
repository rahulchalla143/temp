At that time, variceal bleeding was documented and an ultrasound of the liver performed because of the development of a variceal bleed demonstrated two masses in the right lobe of the liver, the larger measuring 9 x 7 and the smaller 2 x 2.
The spleen was also enlarged and there was evidence of splenorenal varices.
This demonstrated a large complex mass in the right lobe of the liver, an approximately segment V which measured approximately 12x10 cm.
The findings were considered consistent with hepatocellular cancer.
There was also a modest amount of ascites and small bilateral pleural effusions.
A liver biopsy was apparently done at [**Hospital3 3583**] and the findings were consistent with iron overload.
There was also some concern for multiple nodules within the liver.
At least two of which had some early enhancement characteristics consistent with also possible hepatocellular cancer all in the right lobe.
The nineteen-year-old son has been tested for hemochromatosis and was told seven years ago that there was no evidence of this disease.
He has a 52-year-old brother diagnosed with hemochromatosis on the basis of a blood test.

A CT demonstrated 1.large hematoma extending along the entire left posterolateral chest and abdominal wall with unusual cystic structure at the level of the seventh lateral rib with layering hematocrit level and layering contrast within this cyst, suggesting this to be the source for hemorrhage, although no imaging (of this region) was performed during the arterial phase to establish extravasation.
While no mass or cystic structure was seen in the soft tissues on prior chest CT, this raised the question of an underlying lesion such as hemorrhagic metastasis to the soft tissues in this patient with known HCC.
Multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma again noted and grossly unchanged from the prior CT abdomen of [**2201-1-28**].
Again possible tumor thrombus in the left portal vein was noted.
Splenomegaly and multiple varices unchanged.
Enlargement of the right adrenal gland, more prominent than on the CT abdomen of [**2201-1-28**].
Moderate right and small left pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
3-mm nodules in the right and left lower lobes were concerning for metastasis.
Multifocal ground-glass opacities in the right lung concerning for non- specific pneumonitis, possibly due to aspiration.
Hct continued to drop and another arteriogram was performed which did not show any significant bleeding source.
Acute pain service was consulted recommending tizanidine.
Pain was controlled with this and oral pain medication (MS contin [**Hospital1 **] and prn percocet).
The patient decided on DNR/DNI status after discussion of poor prognosis.
He did experience urinary retention on the day his foley was removed ([**4-15**])necessitating replacement of the foley.
Of note, he had significant lower body edema for which he was given lasix.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q3H (every 3 hours) as needed for breakthrough pain.
