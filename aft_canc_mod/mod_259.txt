Radiology: [**2199-5-5**] CTA head and neck: FINDINGS: New hypodensity in the right parietotemporal and occiptal lobes, extending into the right basal ganglia and internal capsule, is consistent with an acute right MCA and PCA territory infarct.
Hyperdense appearance of the right MCA, is most suggestive of a thrombus.
There is mass effect on the body of the right lateral ventricle.
Small hyperdense area within the right globus pallidus (2:18), may represent small hemorrhage within the infarct.
There is complete opacification of bilateral maxillary sinuses and partial opacification of bilateral anterior ethmoid/frontal sinuses.

No evidence for transtentorial or uncal herniation.
ATTENDING NOTE: Subtle hyperdensities within infarct can be due to petechial hemorrhage or uninvolved brain paranchyma.
Small right pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis.
Possible early CHF.
It is difficult to assess for a lower lobe infiltrate given volume loss in both lower lungs and probable effusions.
There is blunting of the CP angles, but no definite infiltrate.

Brief Hospital Course: 79RHF with paroxysmal atrial flutter/AF previously well controlled on sotalol and on dabigatran for anticoagulation, CAD, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, diastolic CHF, HTN, HLD, CKD presented on [**2199-5-5**] with unresponsiveness and left-sided weakness and found to have a severe right MCA/PCA syndrome on examination.
CT showed extensive right MCA and PCA infarcts (PCA infarct was felt likely embolic from fetal PCA) which were felt to be embolic from her Aflutter.
She was admitted to the ICU and dabigatran and other anticoagulation was held due to concern for hemorrhagic conversion and she was treated with aspirin alone initially.
TTE showed a possible left atrial appendage thrombus and she therefore proceeded to a TEE which showed no evidence of thrombus but complex, non-mobile atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
She had persistently poor swallow assessments and aspirated on all consistencies and a Dobbhoff tube was placed.
She was transferred to the floor and there, she was also noted to have intermittent prolonged apneic spells which were felt to likely represent OSA and given her NG tube she could not have CPAP.
She was treated for a UTI and then started spiking fevers which were attributed to likely aspiration pneumonia/HCAP although little to find on CXR or other infectious workup, ID were [**Year (4 digits) 4221**] and eventually signed off and she completed an 8 day course of IV vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam and fevers settled.
Due to fluctuating conscious level, she had an EEG which showed no evidence of epileptiform discharges.
In the process of working up her fevers she had an U/S abdomen which showed a splenic infarct and CT abdomen/pelvis suggested a likely embolic source with evidence of a likely embolus above the origin of the celiac axis and an atherosclerotic plaque at the level of the SMA.
Due to her continued poor swallow, she proceeded to a PEG on [**2199-5-17**] without complication.
She had brief episodes of RVR and this eventually settled and rate was eventually well controlled.
Post-transfusion, her Hb remained stable and she had no episodes of hemodynamic compromise with this Hb drop.
# Neurology: Patient has had no prior stroke but has considerable stroke risk factors of paroxysmal atrial flutter/AF previously well controlled on sotalol but taking an inadequate dose of dabigatran, CAD, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, diastolic CHF, HTN, HLD.
Initial neurological exam revealed patient to be drowsy but arousable, oriented x2 (to self and place) with no apparent aphasia (names reasonably/follows commands) but significant dysarthria.
CN examination reveals PERRL, EOMI, a left facial droop, right gaze deviation but cannot cross midline with left homonymous hemianopia.
Limb exam revealed a dense left hemiparesis with slight withdrawal in LUE and toe extension and knee flexion on LE and good spontaneous movement on right, grimaces to noxious throughout, brisker reflexes on right and right extensor plantar.
CTA head and neck showed a hyperdense right MCA sign, acute right MCA and PCA territory infarcts, a dense right MCA consistent with thrombus and a possible small focus of hemorrhage within the right basal ganglia region with mass effect on right lateral ventricle but no MLS.
CTA showed occlusion of the supraclinoid right ICA and M1 cutoff reconstituting distally.
There was also thought to be occlusion of the distal basilar artery with the tip patent with no right PCA seen although her PCA embolism was felt to be secondary to a fetal PCA.
Stroke risk factors were assessed and patient was monitored on telemetry.
This revealed multiple episodes of RVR requiring PRN diltiazem, metoprolol and at times requiring IV medications.
The likely cause of her extensive infarcts was felt to be embolic from her AF/Aflutter in the setting of the patient mistakenly underdosing dabigatran resulting in inadequate anticoagulation.
She was admitted to the ICU and dabigatran and other anticoagulation was held due to concern for hemorrhagic conversion and she was treated with aspirin alone initially.
TTE on [**5-6**] showed possible left atrial appendage thrombus with mild symmetric LVH with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function, mild AR and a dilated ascending aorta.
She therefore proceeded to a TEE the same day which showed no left atrial appendage thrombus and complex, non-mobile atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
Ideally, she required anticoagulation but due to the large infarct, this was felt to be too great a risk for considerable hemorrhagic conversion and was deferred until after PEG placement.
In the ICU she had episodes of RVR and she was initially treated with IV diltiazem.
Repeat CT scan showed central hyperdensities compatible with hemorrhagic conversion, with slightly increased leftward parafalcine herniation and minimally increased right vertex sulcal effacement and patient clinically improved.
The apnea was felt to be due to OSA with superimposed stroke.
There, she was noted to be more lethargic with fluctuating conscious level and an EEG was requested which showed slowing but no epileptiform activity.
She had continued RVR and diltiazem much improved HR but BP was borderline hypotensive and metoprolol was tapered and uptitrated diltiazem and eventually BP improved and rate was well controlled on the last 3 days of her hospitalisation.
General surgery were [**Year (4 digits) 4221**] regarding possible PEG placement given continued severe dysphagia but wanted to defer surgery until fevers settled.
General surgery were re-contact[**Name (NI) **] after she had no further fevers and patient proceeded to PEG insertion on [**2199-5-17**] without complication.
We held darbepoetin due to possible increased stroke risk and this should be re-addressed by hematology at her soon o/p appointment.
# CVS: Patient has a history of AF/AFlutter diagnosed in [**2194**] s/p a failed cardioversion in [**2195**], HTN, HLD and single vessel CAD who presented with embolic right MCA/PCA stroke as above likely due to cardioembolism from her AF in the setting of inadequate anticoagulation as the patient has been taking her dabigatran only once daily.
Dabigatran and other anticoagulation was held due to concern for hemorrhagic conversion and she was treated with aspirin alone initially.
Her rate control and anti-hypertensive agents were initially held and during her hospitalisation, she had several episodes of RVR requiring IV rate control agents (diltiazem and metoprolol) and her diltiazem was uptitrated.
Whilst in the ICU, the patient had [**1-7**] second pauses on telemetry for which she was asymptomatic and this was felt likely related to medications given patient had been started on both metoprolol, diltiazem, in addition to her sotalol.
Patient was initially transferred out of ICU on [**5-9**] but due to a drop in BP to SBP 80s and 20 sec apneic episodes, was transferred back to ICU for overnight monitoring.
The patient was initially continued on only sotalol 80mg po bid but due to persistent pauses and further AF with RVR, cardiology were [**Month/Day (4) 4221**], sotalol was stopped and she was continued on diltiazem and metoprolol.
She had continued episodes of RVR and diltiazem was uptitrated.
# ID: Patient had an initial leucocytosis with WBCs up to 17.6 and this resolved.
She however started to spike fevers to 102.5F on [**5-10**] and she was started empirically on Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam on [**5-11**] for possible HAP but no good evidence of infection on CXRs.
To further investigate fevers, Doppler U/S of the legs revealed no evidence of DVT and ID were [**Month/Day (1) 4221**] when she again spiked a fever to 101.5F on [**5-14**] who recommended awaiting cultures and completing antibiotic course with further investigations if further fevers.
Abdominal U/S showed a large splenic infarct and to better characterise this, the patient was evaluated with CT abdomen/pelvis which showed her splenic infarct but no evidence of metastatic infection or occult infection.
Her fevers settled and were felt likely secondary to HAP/aspiration pneumonia and she completed an 8 day course of Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam stopped on [**2199-5-17**].
She remained stable after this and had no further fevers.
# GIS: In the process of her infectious workup, she was found to have a splenic infarct on her abdominal ultrasound.
She had some mild generalised abdominal pain and CT abdomen/pelvis showed her previously documented 38 x 75 x 89 mm splenic infarct, in addition to an atherosclerotic plaque at the level of the SMA and a rounded peripheral filling defect just above the origin of the celiac axis likely representing emboli and the likely cause of her splenic infarct was therefore felt to be embolic.
There was no evidence of metastatic infection in addition to unchanged pulmonary nodules (stable from prior study) and gallbladder sludge without cholecystitis.
She had significant fecal loading and she was treated with laxatives.
She had guaiac positive stool as below but did not represent melaena and did not require endoscopy after GI consultation.
# Hematology: Patient has a history of MDS on darbepoetin.
Given her stroke and risks associated with increasing blood viscosity, darbepoetin was held while in hospital.
She had a chronic anemia with HCt 27-30.
She developed what we feel to be a reactive thrombocythemia and from [**Date range (1) 8769**] he was noted to have a Hb drop from 8.5 to 6.8 in the setting of an inadequate reticulocyte count (0.1) and although stool was minimally guaiac positive, this was not enough to explain this loss.
After hematology, GI and general surgery consults, this was felt to represent her MDS and required 2 units of RBCs and she had been usually requiring 2 units per month in the community prior to starting darbepoetin.
Post-transfusion, her HB remained stable at 9.8 and she had no episodes of hemodynamic compromise with this Hb drop.
# RS: Patient was persistently tachypneic during her hospitalisation and this improved.
CXRs showed atelectasis and effusions which improved after her home furosemide was restarted and she was treated with an 8 day course of IV piperacillin /tazobactam for presumed HCAP/aspiration pneumonia although there was no clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
She had episodes of sleep apnea up to 20s during her hospitalisation and this improved as her mental status improved.
Speech re-evaluated patient and found persistent poor swallow aspirating on all consistencies and she proceeded to a PEG tube insertion on [**2199-5-17**].
Was not hemodynamically unstable as a result of her Hb drop.
- Darbepoetin has been held and should be restarted as deemed appropriate by hematology - she has hematology follow-up - She has had episodes of AF with RVR and she may require further uptitration of her diltiazem or metoprolol although has been well controlled over the past 3 days.
- Patient had urinary retention following removal of catheter.

She has had a fluctuating examination and has been more or less responsive at times but better currently.
Verbalising well without suggestion of significant aphasia and talking in short sentences.
Left homonymous hemianopia.
Flaccid LUE with minimal flexion in UE to noxious, likely slight left [**Last Name (un) 5355**] dorsiflexion is a spinal reflex.
You presented with unresponsiveness and left sided weakness.
CT showed a very large stroke affecting the right side of your brain.
This was felt to be a result of a combination of your irregular heartbeat and that you were mistakenly only taking your Pradaxa once as opposed to twice per day.
You were initially admitted to the ICU and you had high heart rates which required medications to treat this.
You had a heart ultrasond (echocardiogram) including a repeat tran-esophageal echocardiogram which showed no clear evidence of clot in your heart.
You were treated for a urinary tract infection and then you began spiking fevers and the infectious diseases doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4221**].
You were treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for a likely pneumonia and the fevers settled.
In tthe process of your work-up, we found a stroke to your spleen which is also likely because of a blood clot.
Risks of this are as before namely increasd bleeding risk for instance if you cut yourself it will be more difficult to stop bleeding and if you hit your head you need to seek urgent medical attention as there is a risk of bleeding in the brain.
You had significant swallowing problems and you were initially fed with an NG tube but given continued poor swallowing on repeated assessments, you had a feeding tube called a PEG tube inserted into your stomach on [**2199-5-17**].
There were no complications from your surgery and you were transferred to rehab on [**2199-5-23**].
We thought you likely have sleep apnea given pauses in respirations observed on the floor.
Your blood cpount dropped an this was felt likely due to your myelodysplastic syndrome and you required a blood transfusion for this.
