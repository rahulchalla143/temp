Admission Date:  [**2163-12-20**]       Discharge Date:  [**2163-12-25**]   Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transfer from [**Hospital3 672**] Hospital for respiratory failure and unresponsiveness.
The patient was in the facility for two days and on the day of admission the patient was found unresponsive with a heart rate of the 40s and a blood pressure of 70/48.
The patient had a chest x-ray that showed significant bilateral pleural effusions which was unchanged from the report obtained from [**Hospital1 2177**] on discharge.
In addition, a head CT was also obtained that showed no acute process.
History of MRSA pneumonia, Pseudomonal pneumonia.
Peptic ulcer disease.
Congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction.
History of pulmonary nodules.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Atrial fibrillation (rate controlled).
Aztreonam for Pseudomonas resistance.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
Heart: Irregularly/irregular, S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.
Extremities:  No edema, cyanosis, or clubbing.
EKG was bradycardiac with low voltage, poor R wave progression and normal axis.
RESPIRATORY:  The patient presented with respiratory failure and is on a ventilator and trach.
The patient's reason for respiratory failure is multifactorial consisting of both COPD, pneumonia, CHF.
The patient's ventilator settings throughout the hospital course remained anywhere between assist control of 500 times 16, PEEP of 5, FI02 of 40%, not much changes could be made to the vent as the patient began to overbreathe or the patient would end up autopeeping.
It was decided to continue adjusting the vent settings as appropriate without autopeeping.
The patient does have a history of Pseudomonas pneumonia that is resistant to pretty much every antibiotic except aztreonam.
RENAL FAILURE:  The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine anywhere between 1.6 and 1.9.
However, on admission to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient's creatinine was up to 3.2 which was most likely secondary to ATN since the patient was initially hypoperfusing with a very low systolic blood pressure.
CARDIOLOGY:  The patient does have a history of atrial fibrillation but the Diltiazem was held on admission since the patient was bradycardiac, unclear of the reason why the patient was found unresponsive as there could have been some kind of cardiac event; however, the patient's CK remained flat throughout the hospital course but troponin T was elevated.
It began to slowly trend downwards throughout the hospital course and so was thought to be secondary to renal failure.
There was some concern for a cardiac involvement and so an echocardiogram was also obtained that showed an ejection fraction of 55% but that was done on dopamine.
Other significant echocardiogram findings were that there was no tamponade and there was mild septal hypokinesis.
HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY:  The patient has a history of multiple myeloma and has been closely followed at the [**Hospital6 11241**].
The patient did receive two to three units of packed red blood cells during this hospital course to help with volume expansion and also to maintain a crit of greater than 27.
The patient also had an episode of abdominal pain which was thought to be secondary to constipation.
The patient received a bowel regimen and had a bowel movement and his abdominal pain seemed to have resolved.
CODE:  The patient presented to the hospital and was full code; however, given the patient's overall poor prognosis and his multiple medical problems and deteriorating conditions, an extensive family meeting was held with the daughter who agreed that the patient should be DNR (no heroic measures should be performed; for instance if the patient does have an MI or goes into V tach or V fib, we are not to shock the patient or perform CPR).
A further discussion is suppose to be held with the attending and the daughter regarding making no pressors as well.
