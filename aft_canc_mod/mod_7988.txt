He was found to be in massive renal failure and a ct scan of his abd showed that there was a nectoric tumor mass that is compressing the ileal conduit that is causing hypronephrosis and obstruction to the kidneys bilaterally.

This causes compression of the exiting ileal loop that causes dilatation of the small bowel and bilateral hydronephrosis.
CT Head: no acute changes .
CXR: The lungs are low in volume and show three right lung nodules measuring 14 mm the right upper lobe and 19 and 16 mm in the right lower lobe.
A left lower lobe lesion is better seen on the concurrently performed abdomen and pelvis CT.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
Right pulmonary metastases have increased in size .
The degree of moderate hydronephrosis, bilaterally, is not significantly changed over the short interval.
Large parastomal mass, several omental metastases, and retroperitoneal/pararectal lymphadenopathy, though unchanged compared to CT from earlier today, are new compared to the [**3-26**], [**2196**] study.
Unchanged small-to-moderate volume ascites.
Asymmetric subcutaneous edema involving the visualized portion of the proximal left thigh, increased compared to the prior study from [**2196-3-26**], with no (non-contrast) CT evidence of DVT.
Unchanged small fluid collection anterior to the pubic symphysis, in continuity with a probable large hydrocele.
Brief Hospital Course: 44 year old man with past medical history of metastatic bladder cancer s/p neoadjuvant chemo, followed by radical cystoprostatectomy with ileal conduit urinary diversion, radiation who was brought in for AMS and found to have [**Last Name (un) **] and bilateral hydronephrosis secondary to a high density obstruction temporarily relieved with red [**Doctor First Name **] catheter awaiting further management.
CT head did not show evidence of metastases.
#Acute renal failure, postrenal: Necrotic tumor next to ileal conduit causing obstruction, obstruction as evidenced by b/l hydronephrosis, baseline Cr is 0.9.
Urine culture eventually grew out Enterococcus, but only 10k-100k colonies, and the patient did not have symptoms of sepsis.
Sensitivities showed VRE, and Linezolid was not an option given multiple interactions with patient's other medications.
The acidosis and hyperkalemia were likely due to the acute renal insufficiency.
The hyponatremia was likely due to volume depletion leading to ADH release.
#Goals of Care / Pain Management: Goals of care were discussed between the patient, his family, the MICU team, the [**Location (un) 2274**] Palliative Care attending, the Hospice nurse, the Urology team, the patient's primary urologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the Hem/Onc Consult Service, Interventional Radiology, and the patient's primary oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The goal of this hospitalization was to clear the patient's urinary obstruction in a more permanent way with the least invasive procedure possible.
The patient's pain was managed with fentanyl patch, which we increased in dose from 150mcg Q72H to 200mcg Q72H at the recommendation of the Atrius Palliative Care attending.

We were able to place a tube to drain out the urine and relieve the stress on the kidneys.
We made the following changes to your medications:  STOP taking enoxaparin STOP oxycodone  START taking atropine sublingually as needed for secretions use two FENTANYL patches (100mcg each) at an INCREASED DOSE of 200mcg every 72 hours START Dilaudid 4mg 1-2 tablets by mouth every 4 hours as needed for pain  Please take all other medications as previously prescribed.
