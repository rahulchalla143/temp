IMAGING: [**2194-12-29**] PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY: IMPRESSION: Limited examination without definite evidence for acute disease.
Noting the limitations of this study, if pulmonary symptoms were to persist or worsen, a short-term followup radiographs should be considered, preferably with standard PA and lateral technique, if possible to reassess the significance, if any, of vague left basilar opacity.
[**2194-12-29**] CT HEAD: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or acute territorial infarction.
The ventricles are only minimally prominent, likely due to mild brain parenchymal atrophy.
Mild mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air cells is unchanged.
There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bone lesions.
No acute intracranial process.
Mild ethmoid sinus disease.
[**2194-12-30**] CHEST X-RAY: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-29**], there is little change.
Extremely low lung volumes with bibasilar opacification that could well reflect atelectasis.
However, in view of the clinical history, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
Upper zones are clear, and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
[**2194-12-30**] CHEST X-RAY: FINDINGS: A single portable frontal view of the chest shows a right PICC line with the tip within the lower SVC, approximately 2.3 cm from the superior atriocaval junction.
Again seen are low volumes with a slightly elevated left hemidiaphragm.
There is persistent opacification of the left base consistent with atelectasis or consolidation.
There are no significant changes from the recent prior radiograph.
There are no pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.
Persistent opacification of the left base consistent with atelectasis or consolidation.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 79**] is an 84 year old gentleman with a PMH of CLL diagnosed [**2180**], now on Campath 3x/week (since [**2194-12-15**]), asthma, hypertension and bronchietasis, admitted with acute onset respiratory distress, productive cough, fever, and AMS, found to have LLL pneumonia, initially stabilized on nebulizers and IV antibiotics in the ICU, then with continued improvement on the floor with oral antibiotics.
Hospital course complicated by hypotension, responsive to fluid boluses.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Febrile respiratory distress: Most likely from infectious process in left lung base, as demonstrated on chest x-ray, superimposed on poor lung substrate from chronic bronchiectasis and asthma.
Pneumonia was highest on the differential in this profoundly immunocompromised patient, given his cough, fevers, and possible infiltrate on CXR.
As for other possible non-infectious causes, campath itself can also cause bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, or non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema; however, he received previous doses without significant incident.
He denied any chest pain; EKG was without ischemic changes; troponins were negative x2.
While the patient had mild LE edema on exam, there were no other signs of CHF and no history of CHF.
PE was in the realm of possibility given malignancy and acute onset of symptoms; however he was not tachycardic and hypoxia improved with nebulizers and supplemental oxygen.
He restarted Campath treatment on [**2195-1-2**] without incident.
# Hypotension: While in the ICU, the patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s-70s while sleeping, but asymptomatic.
His BPH medications were less likely culprits of his hypotension.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # CLL: Currently on cycle 2 of Campath (started [**2194-12-15**]).
Patient is pancytopenic and neutropenic, with ANC 930.
# Chronic kidney disease: During admission, creatine remained 1.3-1.4 within his baseline range (1.3-1.6).
# History of falls at home: Concerns were raised by nursing staff about patient's history of falls at home.
He was ambulate around his room and [**Doctor Last Name **] without difficulty.
TRANSITION ISSUES: # Respiratory status should be monitored closely at upcoming outpatient appointments.
# Fall risk should be followed and assessed as outpatient.
