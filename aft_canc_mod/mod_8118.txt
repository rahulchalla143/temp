Degenerative changes noted.
Bladder distended, but trabeculated, which may be secondary to outlet obstruction or cystitis, correlate clinically.
[**2155-9-1**]   FINDINGS:  Multiple fluoroscopic images of the left hip in the operating room demonstrate interval placement of a dynamic compression screw with associated fracture plates and screws fixating an intertrochanteric fracture of the left proximal femur.

[**Doctor Last Name **] Gross Description by:   DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]/rate  SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: hypopharyngeal tumor, Left Femoral Neck Reamings.
Left femoral neck reamings (C): Bone and skeletal muscle with recent hemorrhage consistent with fracture.
It was received from the OR and consists of multiple fragments of tan tissue measuring 1 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm in aggregate.
The specimen was partially submitted for frozen section examination and the frozen section diagnosis by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10940**] is:  "Positive for carcinoma, favor squamous cell".
The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette C.  CXR [**2155-9-9**] Moderate right pleural effusion has increased.
Severe bibasilar consolidation is unchanged.
In addition to persistence of severe gaseous distention of the colon in the upper abdomen, there is new definition of the outer wall of the bowel, raising serious concern for pneumoperitoneum.
Pulmonary congestion and pleural effusion is again seen, unchanged, left greater than right.
The pulmonary vasculature does not show signs of congestion.
There is no pulmonary edema, chest consolidation.
There is no pneumothorax or other complications noted.
As before, there is marked gas distention of the large bowel which raises the question of a possible obstruction or ileus.
There is no evidence of free abdominal air.
IMPRESSION:  Marked gaseous distention of the large bowel.
Recommend followup abdominal radiographs to assess for obstruction or ileus.
Pulmonary congestion and effusion is unchanged from imaging earlier today.
Abdominal X-ray [**2155-9-10**] FINDINGS:  Single frontal image of the abdomen shows some dilated small bowel loops with air and stool in the rectum and descending colon.
IMPRESSION:  Dilated small bowel loops indicating possible ileus with no definitive evidence of obstruction.

There is no discrete evidence of pneumonia, but bibasilar densities could be contributing to the patient's clinical picture.
IMPRESSION:  Essentially unchanged chest radiograph with persistent bibasilar opacities and left pleural effusion.
Head CT [**2155-9-16**] FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, or mass effect.
Encephalomalacic changes are seen in the right frontal lobe, likely from prior infarction or trauma.
White matter hypodensity in the left frontal region, consistent with small vessel ischemic changes.
The ventricles and sulci are moderately enlarged, consistent with moderate involutional changes, slightly advanced for age.
Mucosal thickening is seen in bilateral maxillary sinuses.
No acute intracranial pathology.
Since this time, there has been increase in the opacities within both bases and they now extend into the left upper lobe.
These appearances could be due to an extending pneumonia, but some failure may also be present.
In this continuous recording, there was diffuse background slowing with 6-7 Hz theta activity superimposed with delta activity.
The video captured several episodes of right arm and hand myoclonic jerks, right hand finger minor myoclonus, as well as left leg myoclonic jerks.
None of those episodes had clear EEG correlates.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed electrode artifact.
There were no epileptiform discharges.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were no electrographic seizures.
SLEEP: The patient progressed from wakefulness to sleep with no additional findings.
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
The video captured several episodes of myoclonus with no EEG correlates.
There were no electrographic seizures or epileptiform discharges.
There was diffuse background slowing which indicates mild to moderate encephalopathy.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There are innumerable large aggressive  pathological appearing lymph nodes in the neck and the upper arm producing degree of mass effect and deviation of vascular structures, though no good frank evidence of  of DVT .
Pathological lymphadenopathy.
Throughout, it showed a mildly disorganized and slow background with posterior frequencies of 7.5 or so at maximum.
There are also several bursts of generalized slowing.
They did not have any EEG correlate.
Several appeared to be isolated jerking of the right arm without rapid repetition.

Isolated episodes of right arm jerks were seen on video without any EEG correlate.
CT Neck [**2155-9-24**] FINDINGS:  The previously identified infiltrative mass in the postcricoid space is smaller than the [**2155-9-1**] study measuring 2.5 x 4.4 cm.
The mass in the left piriform sinus has decreased in size, now measuring 1 x 1 cm, decreased from 1.5 x 1.1 cm.
The previously identified metastatic cervical lymph nodes have decreased in size.
Mild fat stranding is present throughout the soft tissues.
No new masses are identified.
There are calcifications of the bilateral carotid bifurcations, right greater than left.
There are bilateral pleural effusions and ground-glass opacities at the lung apices bilaterally.
There is no acute fracture or malalignment.
Mild degenerative changes of the cervical spine.
Decrease in size of the postcricoid mass, the left piriform sinus mass and the bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy.
Pleural effusions and patchy ground-glass opacities in the visualized lung apices.
Recommend correlation with chest CT of same date  CT Chest [**2155-9-24**] FINDINGS:  The exam is severely limited by noise and streak artifact from the patient's left arm, immobile because of humeral neck fracture.
Specifically, evaluation of the left axilla, where prominent nodes were seen on the recent ultrasound, is limited by streak artifact.
There is no mediastinal or hilar adenopathy.
Mild coronary artery calcifications are restricted to the circumflex distribution.
A pericardial effusion is small.
This exam is not tailored to evaluate subdiaphragmatic structures.
Large bilateral pleural effusions, substantially enlarged since [**2155-9-4**] are responsible for severe atelectasis, collapse in the lower lobes, non confluent elsewhere.
This and respiratory motion interfere with evaluation of the lung parenchyma, but there appears to be some edema in the upper lobes.
Small regions of ground-glass opacity, for example in both upper lobes (4:60, 74, 137) could be due to viral infection.
Small lung nodules are likely to be missed.
Impacted left humeral neck fracture is unchanged since [**8-31**].
There is a prominent lower thoracic Schmorl's node.
There are no concerning osteolytic or sclerotic bone lesions.
Increasing large bilateral pleural effusions, mild pulmonary.
Recent  PET CT showed evidence of left lower lobe pneumonia.
On the current exam left lower lobe consolidation is mostly attributable to collapse rather than infection.
A PET avid subcarinal lymph node is not well assessed on this limited CT. 4.
Scattered ground glass opacity is likely viral infection.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
There is also diastolic invagination of the right ventricular free wall.
Ultrasound Left Axilla [**2155-9-25**] Exam is limited due to patient mobility due to recent fracture of the left humerus.
In the left axilla there is a single prominent lymph node measuring 5 mm in short axis with preserved fatty hilum, but somewhat irregularly thickened cortex which measures up to 3 mm.
In the medial upper arm between the biceps and triceps muscles is a partially calcified ovoid focus measuring 2.3 x 1.3 x 1.5 cm with multiple punctate echogenic foci with an additional structure seen more distally measuring 5.1 x 1.4 x 1.8 cm with more heterogeneous echotexture.
No other suspicious lymph nodes are seen in the region.
In comparison with prior CT chest, note is made that a comminuted fracture of the left proximal humerus is present, and calcified structures were present in the soft tissues of upper left arm possibly corresponding to the above described structures.
Therefore, while calcified metastatic nodes cannot be excluded, post traumatic calcifications such as myositis ossificans could cause similar findings.
IMPRESSION: Calcified nodules in the left upper arm, in the setting of comminuted left humeral fracture could represent post traumatic calcifications such as myositis ossificans although calcified metastases are not excluded.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized echolucent, circumferential pericardial effusion.
There is minimal diastolic invagination of the right ventricular free wall without sustained right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in the mitral valve inflow, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
Small to moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion with without frank echocardiographic tamponade.
There may be increase in the diffuse interstitial prominence seen on the right.
On the left, there is increasing opacification with reduced area of aeration of the lung.
In the absence of displacement of the mediastinal structures, this suggests combination of pleural effusion and volume loss in the underlying lung.
Fracture of the left proximal humerus is again seen.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no overt echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.

Mild cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta are unchanged.
Bibasilar opacities , a combination of large effusions and adjacent consolidations are unchanged.
These consolidations could be due to atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.

Bibasilar opacities are unchanged since [**10-7**] and could represent atelectasis, however superimposed infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 year old male with hypopharyngeal mass and alcohol abuse presented with left proximal humerus fracture and femur fracture who subsequently developed respiratory distress.
# Dysphagia / SOB / Repiratory distress: likely secondary to extensive hypopharyngeal and piriformis mass.
ENT wanted ICU monitoring in setting of increase edema and airway compromise.
Biopsy was taken of mass in OR and showed squamous cell carcinoma.
Speech and swallow was consulted and through testing saw risk for aspiration.
Breathing improved following chemotherapy, although patient continued to have intermittent coughing and difficulty dealing with oral secretions.
Pt developed acute respiratory distress on [**2155-10-7**] early morning and was transferred to the ICU for management of his airway.
Exam was suggestive of upper airway compromise, and there was concern for obstruction secondary to tumor mass effect although acuity of decompensation would be unusual for mass progression.
In the peri-intubation period, he became hypotensive likely related to the medications used for intubation.
The cause of his acute decompensation remains unclear but per ENT and repeat CT imaging after intubation, pt had significant edema and swelling of his soft palate and tonsils but there was no notable change in the size of his neck mass.
Patient has known bilateral pneumothoraces after bilateral chest tube placement, stable from prior.
Pt had a sputum on [**10-8**] that showed gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters but cultures have not shown any growth to date.
# Squamous cell carcinoma Pathology ultimately revealed SCC of the head/neck.
Patient underwent PET CT which revealed large FDG avid hypopharyngeal mass inseparable from esophagus and causing significant narrowing of the airway.
Patient had subsequent anemia requiring transfusions [**9-14**] and [**9-17**], [**10-17**] thrombocytopenia (which resolved without necesitating platelet transfusion), and neutropenia (treated with neupogen earlier in admission).
CT of neck and chest [**9-24**] showed significant improvement in disease burden and degree of airway narrowing.
# Left proximal humerus fracture and femur fracture.
no range of motion restrictions, no weight bearing restrictions, humerus non op management with sling for comfort.
Pericardial effusion, pleural effusions: Patient appeared chronically volume overloaded on exam after transfer to oncology service, had no known history of cardiac disease.
Diuretics given on multiple occasions, volume status continued to be challenging to manage.
CT of the chest on [**9-24**] showed large bilateral pleural effusions significantly increased from previous imaging, as well as small pericardial effusion.
Echo done to evaluate for decreased EF, wall motion abnormalities found pericardial effusion causing significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
There was also diastolic invagination of the right ventricular free wall.
Pulsus was difficult to measure due to right sided PICC line and LUE edema secondary to fracture and lymphadenopathy, but was approximately 8.
SIADH vs. hypervolemic state (given peripheral edema, pleural effusions).
# Alcohol Withdrawal with history of seizures.
# Fever/leukocytosis: Patient developed fever and leukocytosis [**2155-9-1**].
Patient started on ciprofloxacin for UTI, urine culture grew Klebsiella sp.
The patient developed another fever on [**2155-9-20**], and was broadly covered with vanc, cefepime and clindamycin given risk for skin infections due to pressure ulcers as well as aspiration risk.
Pt's pleural effusion and pericardial tissue but not pericardial effusion cultures from [**2155-9-29**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16437**].
There were concerns by ID service that 2 other patients recently had [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16437**] infections after having a pericardial window procedure.
Pt had a sputum on [**10-8**] that showed gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters but cultures have not shown any growth to date.
# Myoclonic jerks/altered mental status: patient intermittently confused during hospitalization.
Developed myoclonic jerks of right side [**9-21**], concerning for seizures given altered mental status.
EEG ordered, showed generalized slowing consistent with encephalopathy, no seizure activity.
Patient's symptoms started around the same time antibiotics restarted, so possibly a drug effect.
Also with chronic hyponatremia, metabolic alkalosis.
No asterixis on exam.
# Hypertensive urgency: episode of HR 30's BP 220/110 after peripheral was flushed with Neo in it, Levo stopped, and BP trended down to 180's systolic and HR stable in the 50's.
# Hypothyroidism Patient carries diagnosis of hypothyroidism for which he has not been treated.
TSH found to be elevated on repeat testing in course of workup for hyponatremia and thyroid hormone supplementation was begun.
