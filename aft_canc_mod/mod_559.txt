Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
Cholelithiasis with no sign of cholecystitis.
CXR ([**2144-10-18**]): Chronic blunting of the right costophrenic angle presumably due to scarring and/or chronic effusion.
No acute pulmonary process.
The lung volumes are slightly increased, but in spite of increased lung volumes, left perihilar and lower lobe opacities seem somewhat more prominent, suggestive of worsening atelectasis or pneumonia.
Much or all of the left lower lobe is probably involved.
The presence of a coexisting right perihilar opacity may be due to co-existing pulmonary vascular congestion.
Interval increase of left upper lobe opacity 2.
Interval improvement of the left lower lobe opacity 3.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
Slight increase in extent of a pre-existing right basal and retrocardiac opacity.
No other parenchymal opacities.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic pressures.
Brief Hospital Course: 51 y/o M with hx of asthma, CKD, DM, who presented with respiratory distress.
# ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME: On arrival to MICU, he appeared to be in respiratory distress, as he was his accessory muscle to breath, was tachypneic and uncomfortable and  visibly diaphoretic drenching his gown.
The patient was found to be H1N1 positive and also developed a severe asthma exacerbation.
His chest x-ray was initially normal, but developed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates during his ICU admission.
Fentanyl was stopped for concern of frozen chest and propofol was limited by elevated triglycerides.
# VENTILATOR-ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA: On [**10-26**], he spiked fever to 101.2 and was started on cefepime/vanc.
He developed erythematous rash on face after cefepime and during vancomycin infusion.
Sputum grew out klebsiella pneumoniae.
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  Patient was admitted with acute on chronic renal failure, with FeNa 0.47.
RUQ US showed persistent right hydronephrosis, which could be related to his chronic renal insufficiency.
# RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT PAIN:  He had RUQ pain on admission, and an ultrasound showed echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration, but other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
He had elevated LFTs as well, which were stable during this hospital stay.
He should have follow up to confirm resolution of these abnormalities.
# DIABETES: At home his blood sugars were well controlled on glyburide.
# HYPERTENSION:  Patient was normotensive on admission, but became hypertensive while not tolerating vent and as home BP meds were held.
# STEROID-ASSOCIATED MYOPATHY: Patient developed marked muscle weakness in MICU in the setting of paralytics and high dose steroids.
# DEPRESSION: Outpatient amitriptyline and sertraline were continued.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: One (1) puff Inhalation once a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Nightingale Nursing  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: H1N1 pneumonia ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia  Secondary diagnoses: Type II diabetes COPD Asthma Hypertension GERD Depression   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile, satting well on room air, regaining strength, ambulating well with assistance   Discharge Instructions: It was a pleasure to be involved in your care, Mr. [**Known lastname 1538**].
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] because of respiratory distress.
You were also found to have bacterial pneumonia, for which you were treated with antibiotics.
You developed significant weakness while you were in the intensive care unit because of the medications you received.
You were found to have slightly elevated liver function test enzymes during this hospital stay.
Ultrasound of the abdomen also showed that your right kidney has some distention from urine (called "hydronephrosis"), please follow up with your primary care doctor on this as well.
