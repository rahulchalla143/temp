Admission Date:  [**2113-6-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2113-6-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2037-10-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Sulfonamides / Penicillins / Decongestant Sinus  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2969**] Chief Complaint: 75 y/o woman with a history of moderate asthma, and recent mediastinal mass, who presents with dyspnea and chest discomfort.
History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 724**] is a 75 year old woman with history of asthma, allergies and hypertension.
One week ago ([**6-15**]), she noticed a worsening dry, non productive cough she had an xray on [**6-15**] which did not demonstrate evidence of pneumonia.
Her cough worsened and she noticed chest tightness.
She noticed that the pain was persistent and did not flucuate with breathing.
She localized the pain to the center of her chest.
Her cough and discomfort progressed to the point that she requested that her daughter stay with her because her condition made her feel unsafe alone.
She noted blurry vision, tingling in the hands and feet, bouts of chills, an elevated temp at 99.6, five pound weight loss (over 1 month).
The night before admission, Ms [**Known lastname 724**] had a particularly sever episode of coughing with chest pain.
ROS: postive for vomiting, negative for diarrhea, diplopia  ED Course: Vitals: t 97.5 bp 173/87 rr 20 o2 98 Ddimer: 438 CTA: negative EKG sinus rhythm, 1st degree heart block, consistent with baseline   Past Medical History: Asthma diagnosed at age 50, treated at [**Hospital1 18**], previously hospitalized, never intubated.
Allergies GERD Post nasal drip Diabetes: treated a year ago with metformin, but pt experienced nausea and stopped use.
Hypertension   Social History: Lives alone in [**Location (un) **].
Dresses and cooks for herself.
No history of tobacco or alcohol use.
Family History: No known family history of cancer  Physical Exam: Gen: Patient was found in bed, in gown, alert and attentive, NAD Vitals: 99.6 bp 120/70 hr 84 o2 98 3L HEENT: normocephalic, EOMI, PERRL, no exopthalmus, moist mucous membranes Neck: no cervical or supraclavicular LAD, no palpable thyroid nodules Pulm: bilateral rhonchi right greater than left, no wheezes  apprecriated, no dullnes to percussion Cor: heart sounds distant, normal s1 and s2 no appreciable murmurs rubs or gallops Abodomen: non distented, nontender, RUQ tenderness, no involuntary guarding, no hepatosplenomegaly Extemities: equivocal reduced vibration sense below the knees, palable pedal and popilteal pulses Neuro: AOx3, no fatigability of eyelids   Pertinent Results: Labs: WBC 5.8 Hct 34.2 Na 117 Serum Osm 260 Urine Osm 144 Glu 161  Peak Flow Today; 200, 200, 250 Peak flow: 250 to 300  Studies: CXR [**6-19**]: anterior mass unchanged from [**6-15**], no new opacities or nodules CT Chest [**6-16**]: Anterior mediastinal mass 9x6x7 well circumscribed, non invasive, without calcification, likely thymoma  Swallow-study [**2113-6-28**] Mrs. [**Known lastname 724**] presents with a mild pharyngeal dysphagia at this time primarily characterized by impaired airway closure from left vocal cord immobility/paresis with resulting aspiration of liquids.
Repeat video swallow study in the next 2-3 months to monitor dysphagia and pending ENT intervention.
The apical component is conceivably atelectasis or hemorrhage related to retraction during surgery, but a more focal region in the axillary portion of the right upper lobe developed between [**6-23**] and [**6-25**] and has grown slightly since.
There is also progressive left perihilar and basal consolidation.
Overall findings are concerning for bilateral pneumonia and/or severe atelectasis at the left base.
Small right apical pneumothorax is new or newly apparent.
There is no left pneumothorax, but there is a small and slightly increased left pleural effusion, following removal of the left pleural tube.
Mediastinal caliber is comparable to that on [**6-23**], but there is vascular engorgement, and the heart is top normal size.
Brief Hospital Course: Mediastinal Mass: Likely Thymoma Lymphoma, teratoma, thyroid/parathyroid tumor ruled out with history, exam, and normal tsh, pth, ionized Ca, and Phos.
Neurology evaluated for myasthenia, negative for fatigability.
Of note there was a thoracic duct injury noted intraop which was later clipped.
A JP drain was left in place at the level of the thoracic duct injury to assess for a chyle leak postop.
Preliminary pathology at the time of the procedure was significant for a fibrous tumor and not thymoma.
Both chest tubes were left to suction and no air leak was noted.
On POD1 her diet was advanced and her pain was controlled with a dilaudid PCA now controlled with percocet.
Over the first few postoperative days she was noted to have a significantly hoarse voice and difficulty swallowing.
ENT was consulted out of concern for a recurrent laryngeal nerve injury.
Hyponatremia: Likely euvolemic hyponatremia due to SIADH considering mediastinal mass.
This is consistent with euvolemic hyponatremia.
Cough/Chest pain: While originally thought to be an asthma exacerbation an intraop bronchoscopy showed significant purulent drainage from the right middle lobe.
UTI: A preop UA was noted to be positive and the urine culture was positive for pansensitive E.Coli.
The patient was complaining of dysuria and hesitency.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: asthma, HTN, DM, GERD, s/p TAH Excison of mediastinal mass with pneumonia, UTI   Discharge Condition: Deconditioned requiring rehab   Discharge Instructions: Call Dr.[**Name (NI) **] office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 170**] if you develop increased pain in your chest, shortness of breath, fever, chills, redness or drainage from your incision site.
