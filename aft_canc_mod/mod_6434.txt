Went back to [**State 1727**] to sort out insurance, and was having chronic diarrhea when he presented to [**Hospital6 **] in early [**Month (only) **] for diarrhea/nausea and was d/c'd [**10-19**].
He represented on [**10-25**] with chills, diarrhea, vomitting and 2 syncopal episodes after standing from seated position.
There is no culture data available.
Over night [**Date range (1) 17948**] he became acutely non-responsive after vomiting large amounts of feculent material.

-Hyperkalemia/Hypoalbuminemia -Depression/Adjustment Disorder -?Inguinal Hernia on the Right side  Social History: Reports being an active in martial arts prior to recent decompensation.
Family History: No family history of cardiac disease, liver disease, cancer or renal failure.
Physical Exam: On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU: Vitals: T:96.5 Oral BP:107/78  P: 92 on Vent FiO2:51% O2Sat 99% General: NCAT, intubated HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Bilateral air entry with decreased breath sounds over Lower Right lung field.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: distended, obese, no organomegaly, some ascites noted.
GU: Foley in place Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, +2 pitting edema bilaterally, +1 edema in upper extremities.
No suspicious hepatic lesions identified.
Known underlying fatty infiltration of the liver with sequelae of portal hypertension noted including recanalized paraumbilical vein.
Third spacing involving the gallbladder wall with mild amount of intra-abdominal ascites and mesenteric induration and mild cecal/ascending colonic edema, all likely secondary to underlying portal hypertension.
Scattered enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, presumably reactive.
Mild dilatation and air-fluid levels of the small bowel suggestive of mild ileus.
Moderate right simple pleural effusion.
New infectious or inflammatory centrilobular and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities within the left lower lobe with mild bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening.
Conventional arterial anatomy.
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Doppler parameters are most consistent with normal left ventricular diastolic function.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Left upper ext U/s: No DVT in left upper extremity.
Unchanged presence of a right pleural effusion.
However, the extent of the effusion has decreased in the interval.
Limited study due to large amount of bowel gas obscuring portions of the left hepatic lobe and the pancreas.
Where visualized, no focal liver lesion is seen.
Evidence of portal hypertension, with splenomegaly and small ascites.
Right pleural effusion.
CT head: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1182**] is a 40 year old man with a history of ESLD [**3-10**] NASH, transferred here for acutely decompensated encephalopathy with intubation for airway protection.
# Encephalopathy - likely [**3-10**] decreased bowel movements from ileus.
CT head negative for bleed at OSH.
Ileus likely caused by electrolyte abnormalities from 2 months of preceding diarrhea and pt had bowel surgeries in the past for Crohn's disease with small bowel/colonic anastomoses.
CT scan showed bowel edema which may be [**3-10**] ascites and can cause malabsorption.
# Ileus - as above, likely from electrolyte abnormalities from chronic diarrhea.
No evidence of complete SBO at OSH, erythromycin was started then discontinued to help move bowels.
#ESLD/Cirrhosis - cirrhosis [**3-10**] NASH diagnosed on biopsy in [**4-15**], c/b ascites, recurrent R hydrothorax and encephalopathy.
Ultrasound of liver showed no signs of thrombosis or flow impedance.
CT scan did not show suspicious liver lesions.
Has recurrent R side hydrothorax which was drained once on initial presentation in [**4-15**].
# Aspiration - intubated at OSH for aspiration [**3-10**] vomiting feculent material from ileus.
CXR showed signs of aspiration pneumonitis, pt completed a 7-day course of vanc/zosyn.
Prior to discharge had no oxygen requirement and was afebrile.
# Anemia - HCT around 23-24 throughout admission.
No evidence of active bleeding, no blood in stool, likely chronic.
No evidence of hemolysis.
