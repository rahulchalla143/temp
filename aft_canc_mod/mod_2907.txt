It surrounds the aorta and celiac axis with tethering of the left gastric artery.
A 3.1 x 1.9 cm periportal node is also seen.
Large heterogenous splenic mass.
Heterogenous bulky retroperitoneal adenopathy surrounding the aorta and celiac artery.
These findings are concerning for lymphoma.
Left renal exophytic cyst.
Possible right renal cyst.
Given the high proliferation fraction, the differential diagnosis includes a high grade diffuse large B-cell lymphoma versus an atypical Burkitt lymphoma.
Differential includes atypical Burkitt's vs large B-cell lymphoma.
[**2100-10-28**] CT Chest: IMPRESSION:  1) Right hilar lymphadenopathy measuring 17 mm in diameter, as well as slight prominence other bilateral hilar nodes.
In the clinical setting of lymphoma, involvement of lymphoma in the right hilar nodes is suspected.
2) Calcified subcarinal node, with multiple calcified granulomas, representing prior granulomatous infection.
3) Non-calcified pulmonary nodule measuring less than 5 mm in diameter, as described above, probably related to the prior granulomatous infection, however, please follow up these lesions on future CT scans.
[**2100-10-28**]: TTE: Conclusions: 1.The left atrium is mildly dilated.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
It is now more heterogeneous in appearance with low attenuation areas consistent with necrosis.
Small amount of higher attenuation fluid is noted at the inferior margin of the spleen consistent with peri-splenic hematoma.
The retroperitoneal mass of bulky adenopathy involving the proximal abdominal aorta and left diaphragm has also decreased in size.
Active esophagitis, with ulceration.
No viral inclusions or tumor seen.
Acute duodenitis, with multiple crypt abscesses and focal loss of villi.
No viral inclusions or tumor seen.
Note:  Possible causes of the duodenal inflammation include infection and drug injury.
[**2100-11-18**]:CT abdomen: Gallbladder is slightly prominent but demonstrates no secondary signs of cholecystitis.
There is a stable appearing,predominantly hypodense lesion within the spleen measuring 8.2 x 7.0 cm.
A large paraesophageal soft tissue mass measures 6.5 x 5.5 cm and is grossly unchanged in appearance as well.
Pancreas and adrenal glands are normal in appearance  [**2100-11-23**]: CT sinus: IMPRESSION: Minimal ethmoid sinus thickening.
No evidence for splenic, perisplenic, or intra-abdominal hemorrhage.
Unchanged size and appearance of the splenic hypodense lesion, and peri- splenic fluid collection.
Unchanged soft tissue mass in the lesser sac, which is presumably a mass of matted lymph nodes.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 56 yo male with Burkitt's lymphoma.
#Burkitt's Lymphoma - The patient presented to the [**Location 1268**] VA with 5-6 day history of LUQ pain and constipation.
A CT scan at WR was notable for lymphadenopathy concerning for neoplastic disease.
On [**2101-10-27**], CT guided core biopsy of spleen was notable for B cell lymphoma - DLBL vs Burkitts.
CT chest was done for staging which was notable for enlarged R hilum LN.
A bone marrow biopsy was done which suggested T cell dominant lymphoid profile.
There was a small population of CD10 co-expressing B cells; given the known history of a CD10 positive B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, the findings are suspicious and minimal involvement of the marrow cannot be entirely excluded.
He was given anzemet/decadron prior to chemo for antinausea prophylaxis.
The medications were separated in time because he was considered high risk for TLS because his LDH was 1100 and rising and he had Burkitts with a large tumor burden.
He did not develop evidence of hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia, or hypocalcemia.
On day 3, he received IT cytarabine + hydrocortisone with no complications and 400 mg IV cytoxan with no complications.
On day 5, he received the second dose of IT cytarabine with hydrocortisone with no complications.
On day 7, the patient noted an increase in his LUQ pain; a repeat CT of the abdomen showed necrosing tumor decreasing in size.
He tolerated the vincristine well without peripheral numbness/tingling or constipation.
On day 8, the patient had continued increased LUQ pain so he was started on a morphine PCA.
A few hours after having a fever, he started to have profuse watery diarrhea ~2L in 8 hours.
He also had [**12-23**] episodes of projectile vomiting-nonbloody.
He was also started on neupogen (per protocol) and b/c the patient was neutropenic and there was concern of typhilitis.
He was given over 5 Liters NS bolus with no increase in pressures.
CT abdomen was performed with oral contrast (through NGT b/c pt unable to tolerate contrast) due to concern for abdominal source, especially typhlitis.
His CT abdomen demonstrated some mild wall thickening in the cecum.
The patient continued to have diarrhea with  decreased po intake so TPN was started.
The vanco and cefepime were also stopped because he was no longer febrile.
Because the patient was no longer neutropenic, he was able to have an EGD which was notable for grade 1 esophagitis and diffuse nodularity of the mucosa of the duodenom.
The path from the biopsies were consistent with crypt abscess from drug vs infection.
The patient was still afebrile so the caspo was stopped.
Flow was sent on the blood and it was found to not be consistent with Burkitts.
TGG was also sent to evaluate for celiac sprue.
A repeat abdominal CT was done which was notable for stable mass in spleen, stable paraortic lymph nodes and no thickening of wall of small bowel.
He was given 75% dose of etoposide and ara-c, 100% dose of ifosfamide in light of his elevated bilirubin.
Baseline cerebellar check was only notable for minimal intention tremor with finger to nose testing.
His course was complicated only by minimal nausea decreased with anzemet and ativan.
On day 8, the patient received IT MTX with no complications.
#LUQ pain - the patients pain was well controlled with PO pain meds until after his first round of chemo.
The pain then increased and he required a morphine pca for pain control.
The PCA was stopped in the setting of the patient's acute mental status changes while he was hypovolemic/hypotensive.
When he was transferred back to 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**], he was started on a fentanyl pca for pain control.
Prior to discharge, he was changed to ms contin and po msir for breakthrough pain.
#Acute renal failure - In the setting of the patient's hypotensive episode, his creatinine increased to a max of 1.4.
It was felt to be secondary to volume depletion (prerenal).
Due to concern for methotrexate toxicity (completed on [**11-6**]) and MTX level 0.36 on [**11-8**], especially in light of sepsis and potential third spacing of MTX, IV leucovrin was increased and hemodialysis was started.
His methotrexate level decreased appropriately, and no further hemodialysis was required.
#Hyperbilirubinemia - In the setting of the diarrhea, hypotension, the patients bilirubin also started to rise.
The etiology of the hyperbilirubinemia was unknown, and with negative US and CT scan it was felt to be secondary to septic gallbladder (although peaked several days after the episode of hypotension occurred) vs methotrexate effect.
#Altered Mental Status - On day 13, in the setting of the diffuse watery diarrhea and hypotension, the patient became lethargic.
It was felt that the ativan given for his nausea and his morphine pca could be contributing to his altered mental status so both of these were held.
#Depression - The patient has a history of several major depressive episodes.
Morphine Sulfate 15 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for breakthru pain.
