Admission Date:  [**2154-6-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-6-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2093-10-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1**] Chief Complaint: Presents for scheduled surgery  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**6-5**] Partial left thyroid lobectomy [**6-7**] Tracheostomy placement [**6-13**] CT guided liver biopsy   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 70382**] is a 60 year old female who presented earlier this year with a smooth symmetric goiter which was causing some compressive symptoms but was totally benign by biopsy and in fact indicative of Hashimoto's.
She had several things going on in her personal life at that time and by the time surgery was scheduled, she had some increasing shortness of breath and in the last several days, some change in her voice.
Nonsmoker   Family History: Family members with benign thyroid disease  Pertinent Results: Operative note [**6-5**]: Goiter with compressive symptoms secondary to advanced aggressive thyroid cancer with invasion of trachea and pharynx.
Extensive dissection left neck.
Partial left thyroid lobectomy.
Operative note [**6-7**]: Thyroid cancer and respiratory failure.
CT chest [**6-6**]: IMPRESSION: 1) Large thyroid mass/phlegmon which encases and narrows the trachea to the diameter of the endotracheal tube extending from the level of the cords to approximately 5 cm above the carina.
2) Large enhancing mass located between the left kidney and pancreatic tail.
Further evaluation with dedicated abdominal imaging is recommended.
3) 2 cm right hepatic lesion which is not fully characterized on this single phase study but most likely represents a hemangioma.
5.0-cm enhancing mass in the left upper quadrant, with necrotic center.
Although metastasis from thyroid cancer should be considered, additional considerations include primary adrenal neoplasm such as pheochromocytoma (in which case, multiple endocrine neoplasia could be considered).
Less likely, considerations are nonfunctioning islet cell tumor related to the pancreas and gastrointestinal stromal tumor.
Two hypervascular lesions in the liver are concerning for metastases from thyroid cancer.
Fibroid uterus, with 3.3-cm heterogeneous mass with internal calcifications adjacent to the uterus on the left, which may represent a calcified exophytic fibroid.
Successful biopsy of the abdominal mass.
MICROSCOPIC Histologic Type:  Poorly differentiated carcinoma, favor follicular carcinoma.
EXTENT OF INVASION  Primary Tumor:  pT4a:  Tumor more than 4 cm, limited to the thyroid or with minimal extrathyroidal extension (e.g., extension to sternothyroid muscle or perithyroid soft tissues).
Immunohistochemical studies show the tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin cocktail, TTF-1 and thyroglobulin and are negative for calcitonin.
The tumor is felt to be either a poorly differentiated papillary carcinoma or a poorly differentiated follicular carcinoma; the latter is favored.
The size of the tumor is difficult to determine as it involves the entire thyroid lobe.
The tumor invades into perithyroid soft tissue and, therefore, is at least a pT3 tumor.

Post-operatively she was extubated but developed respiratory distress and stridor; POD 2 she underwent a  flexible bronchoscopy and placement of 8-0 Portex tracheostomy tube.
Endocrinology and oncology service were consulted, a CT scan demonstrated no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy; there was a retroperitoneal enhancing mass, no bone lesions suspicious for malignancy, and a right hepatic lesion was also seen.
The retroperitoneal mass was biopsied prior to discharge home with pathology results pending.
POD [**4-1**], she was extubated without difficulty and oxygenating well on humidified tracheostomy collar, she was evaluated by speech and swallow therapy and did not demonstrate signs or symptoms of aspiration, her diet was slowly advanced to regular with thin liquids and pills to be taken with whole liquids which she tolerated well.
Post-operatively she had episodes of delirium and agitation related to diagnosis, tracheostomy, and ICU admission; psychiatry was consulted with recommendations of using Seroquel at bedtime and Haldol.
Her mental status and coping skills improved dramatically over the course of the hospitalization, at the time of discharge her anxiety was well controlled with small doses of Ativan as needed and Trazodone at bedtime.
She was able to change the inner cannula independently and could expectorate her secretions with minimal suctioning required.
Her pain was well controlled with Percocet.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Ten (10) mL PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
