Per OSH records pt had chronic worsening of dyspnea x 2-3 weeks with acute worsening over 2-3 days.
Had been self medicating with increased home 02 and inhalers to which he stopped responding.
He had myalgias and headaches at home.
Mild purulent sputum production.
His CXR per report showed evidence of pulmonary fibrosis but no clear infiltrate.
79-80% PMN, no bands.
Ruled out for flu Seen at by OSH ID consult: Recommended empiric coverage for CAP as well as for OIs with Zosyn, Levaquin, Bactrim IV, caspogungin, and acyclovir as well as discontinuing steroids.
He requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] where he receives his cancer care.
Had been off pressors for duration of transport.
Graft-versus-host disease 3.

Brief Hospital Course: Assessment/Plan: 50M h/o metastatic renal CA s/p nephrectomy, IL-2, mini-allograft SCT, DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02 presents with sepsis.
Admission Assessment and Plan # Sepsis: Likely pneumonia given new opacities on CXR, although difficult to read due to fibrosis.
# Respiratory failure: Pneumonia in patient with poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema, GVHD, fibrosis.
Avoid high pressures given fibrotic lungs, will attempt pressure control to limit.
# Hypotension: Likely sepsis, although probably component of hypovolemia as well.
At risk for PE given malignancy.
Adrenal insufficiency possible.
- Treat broadly per above - [**Last Name (un) **] stim in AM - LENIs - Guaiac stools .
# Cardiac: Patient with probable demand ischemia in setting of hypotension, tachycardia, and sepsis; less likely unstable plaque.
- Continue to trend enzymes and treat underlying cause - ASA, hold on beta-blocker and statin - TTE to eval for wall motion abnormality - Repeat ECG .
# Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte transplant [**12-8**].
No clear source identified for infection but beta-glucan returned positive day prior to patient's death suggesting some component of possible underlying [**Month/Year (2) 1065**] sepsis.
AM cortisol pre-stim revealed adequate adrenal capacity excluding adrenal insufficiency as a cause for hypotensive shock.
Baseline lung disease with fibrosis [**2-3**] to GVHD and need for aggressive fluid resuscitation lead to increasing difficulty with ventilation.
In setting of hypotension developed shock liver with transaminases in 1000's.
