Admission Date:  [**2166-2-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-2-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2086-2-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: STEMI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: RIJ arterial line  History of Present Illness: This is an 80 year old male with largely unknown PMH who presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**2166-2-11**] with a chief complaint of feeling "wobbly" on his feet.
By report he had a fall the night prior to admission to the OSH.
In initial CXR showed a cavitary lesion in the RUL and a follow up CT showed a cavitary mass in the RUL with R hilar and R paratracheal LAD as well as multiple hepatic densities concerning for a metastatic process.
He was given IV fluids for a slightly elevated CK in the setting of his fall.
The following day, [**2166-2-12**], he developed bradycardia on the floor and was intubated and coded, ?
of CPR being administrated.
An ECG showed ST elevations in II, III, and aVF and ST-D in V1-3.
He was treated given aspiring and a plavix load and was med flighted to [**Hospital1 18**] on a heparin gtt.
RCA was occluded proximally with acute thrombus which was removed.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: UNKNOWN per report a history of bladder cancer 10 years ago.
+ BS EXTREMITIES: No edema.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe with small air- fluid level and contiguous soft tissue density mass extending to the right hilum.
Bilateral large pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.
Ultrasound could be performed for further evaluation if clinically indicated.
T6 lytic lesion.
Coronary artery calcifications.
Markedly severe spinal canal stenosis at C5-C6 where there is severe cord compression and extensive cord edema.
This is accompanied by moderate soft tissue edema within the anterior and posterior soft tissues of the neck centered at this C5-C6 level.
There is no acute fracture or subluxation.
These findings in themselves are most suggestive of chronic severe degererative changes compounded by acute trauma.
Note is however made of some meningeal thickening just posterior to the C6 vertebral body extending inferiorly from the area of critical stenosis as well as high T1 signal on delayed post-gadolinium imaging (from prior MR head).
This combination of findings, although probably due to traumatic etiology, can also be seen with infection or malignancy.
Extensive edema centered at C5-C6 stenosis greater than typically seen for stenosis, along with possible enhancement within the cord, raises the possibility of cord infarction secondary likely to trauma.
Echo - There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild inferior hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 80M with limited known PMH presented from OSH with inferior STEMI, s/p RCA revascularization.
Patient was found to have significant neurologic deficits of unclear etiology with lack of movement of bilateral lower extremities and upper extremity weakness left greater than right.
Patient had extensive neurologic work-up including evalution by neurology, MRI head and CT spine and was found to have lesion in the C5/C6 area with edema from either trauma vs. infection vs. malignancy.
Patient had biopsy of cavitary lung lesion which demonstrated squamous cell cancer with likely metastasis given lytic lesion seen in thorax.
Patient was unable to be weaned from the ventilator and family was told that long term prognosis included tracheostomy and PEG with likely profound permanent neurologic impairment.
