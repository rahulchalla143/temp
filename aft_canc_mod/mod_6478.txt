Blood Cultures x 4 No growth to date CXR: [**2164-1-5**] (after pneumostat placed): A very small left apical pneumothorax has, in retrospect, improved from the prior study.
Widespread subcutaneous emphysema persists.
With the exception of the change in pneumothorax, there are no other relevant changes since the recent radiograph of earlier the same date.
[**2164-1-6**] No obvious PTX (difficult to assess due to subQ air), [**Doctor Last Name **] tube in place [**2164-1-3**] Slight increase in size of small left apical pneumothorax.
[**2164-1-3**] Generalized atelectasis in the left lung persists.
Small left apical pneumothorax is larger today than yesterday, apical pleural tube in place.
Persistent subcutaneous emphysema in the left axilla and anterior chest wall.
Heart size top normal, still shifted to the left of midline,reflecting atelectasis on the left.
[**2164-1-1**] Two left-sided chest tubes are again seen with diffuse left-sided subcutaneous emphysema extending to the right side of the neck and in the right lateral chest wall.
The amount of subcutaneous emphysema makes it difficult to assess for a focal infiltrate on the left.
[**2163-12-31**]:  Marked increase in amount of subcutaneous emphysema.
[**2163-12-30**]: The left apical pneumothorax is still present, appears to be unchanged or slightly increased.
There is slight increase in the subcutaneous air in the left hemithorax.
There is no appreciable pleural effusion seen.
Left-sided cardiac atelectasis is slightly worse but still minimal.
[**2163-12-29**]: : Small left apical pneumothorax   Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 3646**] was admitted on [**2163-12-29**] for Sleeve left upper lobectomy (reanastomosis of left lower lobe bronchus to left mainstem bronchus), mediastinal lymph node dissection, intercostal muscle flap buttress.
She had 2 chest tubes anterior apical with a persistent airleak and a posterior basilar were to waterseal.
The acute pain service managed her pain with a Bupivacaine/Dilaudid Epidural with good control.
On POD1 she responded to a IV fluid challenge for low urine output.
Chest film showed small basilar effusion/atelectasis for which pulmonary toilet was continued The anterior chest tube airleak persist.
On POD2 she developed increased increased subcutaneous emphysema, concern for airway dehiscence and anastomotic leak.
She was transferred to the SICU for bronchoscopy revealed no evidence of the dehiscence or any anastomotic leak with saline instilled.
On POD3 She spiked a fever to 101.2 was pancultured and started on IV antibiotics.
POD5 the chest tube was placed to water-seal a chest x-ray showed a stable left apical pneumothorax and left lower lobe atelectasis.
She was followed by serial chest films, pulmonary toilet continued, tolerated a regular diet and her pain was well controlled with PO Dilaudid.
A post CXR showed no increase in PTX/effusion.
In the afternoon, she c/o chest pain when ambulating.
CXR shows no PTX.
