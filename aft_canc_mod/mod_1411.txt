The patient denies that he had chest pain but this was potentially reported at the outside hospital.
EKG at the outside hospital was read as having acute changes.
Troponin was 0.4 and a concern was raised for acute coronary syndrome.
Biliary duct adenocarcinoma with positive lymph nodes, unresectable diagnosis [**2136-1-31**].
Status post exploratory laparotomy and cholecystectomy in [**2136-3-2**] with biliary drainage.
Diabetes mellitus.

Abdomen with biliary drains intact and soft though protuberant with diffuse abdominal pain and no rebound.
Extremities - 3+ pitting edema to the knees.
EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 105 with a Q in III and flipped T wave in lead III which was old.
There was T wave inversion in lead aVF and ST elevation in V1 and V2 with T wave flattening in V3 and V6.
Echocardiogram revealed no focal wall motion abnormalities with some right heart strain and a PA pressure of 58.
Head CT scan was negative for hemorrhage or mass affect or masses.
ASSESSMENT:  Given the EKG changes and echocardiographic changes the patient was felt to have a pulmonary embolus.
A CT angiogram was performed which revealed thrombi in the right tree and multiple bilateral thrombi, left basilar atelectasis and a right effusion and ground glass appearance in the upper lobes.
Chest x-ray revealed a moderate right pleural effusion but no consolidation.
Upon presentation to the floor the patient denied chest pain, headache, nausea, vomiting and decreasing shortness of breath.

He had no further complications of his pulmonary emboli or its treatment.
Infectious Disease - The patient was started on Levaquin and Flagyl as described above for rising white count and abdominal tenderness.
The patient remained afebrile despite a rising white blood cell count blood cultures were negative.
He was followed clinically with no further increase in temperature though white count continued to rise.
Ascites - The patient was felt to have tense ascites and could benefit from a paracentesis for comfort reasons.
Cardiovascular - Though the Troponin was elevated, the patient had no symptoms consistent with acute coronary syndrome.
He was watched closely and had no further chest pain and no further work up of this problem ensued.
Diabetes mellitus - The patient was continued on regular sliding scale insulin.
It was extensively explained to him that DNR / DNI status does not preclude treatment of other medical problems such as paracentesis or pulmonary emboli.
Given the lack of symptoms suggesting a clinical infection.
