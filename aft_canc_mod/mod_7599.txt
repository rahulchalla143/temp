FINAL REPORT [**2180-5-31**]** MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2180-5-31**]):POSITIVE FOR METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPH AUREUS.
MODERATE GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2180-6-7**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR.

Oxacillin RESISTANT STAPH AUREUS COAG +                              | CLINDAMYCIN-----------       R ERYTHROMYCIN----------   =>8 R GENTAMICIN------------ <=0.5 S LEVOFLOXACIN----------   =>8 R OXACILLIN-------------   =>4 R RIFAMPIN-------------- <=0.5 S TETRACYCLINE----------   <=1 S TRIMETHOPRIM/SULFA---- <=0.5 S VANCOMYCIN------------     1 S  CXR: [**2180-6-8**]: Bilateral lower lobe opacities are unchanged since [**2180-6-7**] and may reflect bibasilar atelectasis or pneumonic consolidation.
No effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Persisting bibasilar lung opacities probably atelectases or pneumonic consolidation and unchanged since [**2180-5-16**].
Esophagus: [**2180-6-5**]:  Bibasilar patchy densities are most consistent with atelectasis.
At the anastomosis, there is a mild dilation at the presumed distal esophagus.
Initially, curvilinear areas of barium were seen projecting from the site of the anastomosis; however, delayed images and further spot fluoroscopic images with barium administration demonstrated that this appearance is likely due to folds within the gastric pull-up.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of leak status post Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **] esophagectomy.
