Admission Date:  [**2141-1-4**]       Discharge Date:[**2141-1-12**]  Date of Birth:   [**2080-4-23**]       Sex:  M  Service:Oncology CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Short of breath times one week plus weakness.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of metastatic lung cancer to brain, failure to thrive.
He had a recent diagnosis on [**11-5**] of lung adenocarcinoma with metastases to [**Last Name (LF) 500**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], pericardium.
He had a recent admit for malignant pericardial effusion with tamponade, status post drainage on [**11-5**].
intake but decreased ambulation secondary to weakness post XRT.
Can go approximately 10 steps and then gets tired with short of breath.
In the emergency department he got a dose of Levofloxacin for concern of pneumonia and bronchitis and stress dose steroids.
Chest x-ray shows increased in cardiac silhouette.
Bedside echo concerning for tamponade.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, mitral valve prolapse, status post melanoma.
Empyema left lung [**2122**], status post thoracotomy and supraventricular tachycardia.
Atrial flutter, peripheral visual loss.
No tobacco in the past 20 years, no alcohol.
Left pupil minimally reactive, down visual acuity.
Neck: No jugular venous distention.
Pulmonary:  Coronary artery disease bilaterally.
Abdomen: Soft, nontender, no distension.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Normal intervals, no ST changes or Q-waves, diffuse T-wave changes.
Chest x-ray shows increased in cardiac size, increased pericardial effusion.
Increased left pleural effusion.
Lymphangitic tumor spread unchanged.
A left TTX new since [**2140-11-19**].
Given large pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology.
On cardiac catheterization he demonstrated low pressure tamponade with equalization of right atrium and pericardial pressures.
After removal of approximately one liter of bloody fluid his right atrial and pericardial pressure decreased.
Procedure was notable for pericardial preparation and partial pneumothorax given low atrial/pericardial pressures and evidence of a possible small left pneumothorax.
Follow-up echocardiogram revealed resolution of electrical alternans.
CT Surgery was consulted for possibility of placing a pericardial window for definitive treatment of recurrent pericardial effusions however, it was felt that a procedure of this degree of invasiveness would likely lead to patient's deterioration rather than improvement.
Recommended that the patient undergo q week transthoracic echocardiogram in order to assess the size of pericardial effusion and when deemed large enough the patient is to undergo balloon pericardiocentesis.
The patient's cardiac status improved with this procedure however, his respiratory status remained tenuous requiring 100% non-rebreather mask to maintain O2 saturations in the mid-90%  The patient had marked dyspnea on exertion throughout hospitalization.
It was felt that this is a combination of intrinsic lung damage as well as lymphangitic spread and some small degree of residual cardiac dysfunction.
as he was as an outpatient for an supraventricular tachycardia and remained in a normal sinus rhythm throughout hospitalization.
The patient continued XRT as well as Decadron for palliation.
There were no gastrointestinal issues throughout this hospitalization.
The patient was not felt to be infected and after the initial dose of Levofloxacin in the emergency department antibiotics were discontinued.
