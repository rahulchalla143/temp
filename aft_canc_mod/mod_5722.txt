RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2192-3-24**]):    NO GROWTH.
URINE CULTURE (Pending):  CXR [**2192-3-21**] Large bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right with underlying atelectasis and central vascular congestion.
No pulmonary embolism.
Small peribronchial nodular opacities in the lingula likely representing an acute infectious process.
Large right pleural effusion with associated right lower lobe collapse and leftward mediastinal shift.
Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion with left pleural drain in place.
A small loculated left-sided pleural effusion appears unchanged.
There is increased opacity obscuring the right hemidiaphragm likely representing a combination of increasing effusion and atelectasis.
No pneumothorax is appreciated.
There is a persistent right-sided pleural effusion which appears relatively stable since the previous study.
There are low lung volumes.
Increased density at the right base and perihilar areas are again seen.
CT CHEST [**2192-4-1**] (pending)   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 90426**] is a 74y/o lady who presented with acute respiratory failure due to malignant effusion and was found to have serous ovarian adenocarcinoma.
Ms. [**Known lastname 90426**] had multiple medical issues stemming from newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer.
Those issues included malignant pleural effusions which led to respiratory distress and respiratory failure leading to intubation.
Similarly, she had a distended abdomen from carcinomatosis.
Finally she developed renal failure after one dose of chemotherapy, from which her kidney's did not rebound.
ACTIVE ISSUES IN THE ICU: .
# Respiratory failure on presentation: due to malignant effusion.
Echocardiogram showed a hypokinetic right ventricle suggestive of PE, so a CT angiogram of her chest was performed which showed no evidence of PE.
Initial CXR demonstrated large bilateral pleural effusions with evidence of pneumonia, and she was started on vancomycin and cefepime for healthcare associated pneumonia.
Outside records obtained from [**Hospital 1281**] hospital indicate that a pleural fluid analysis revealed malignant cells, most likely papillary serous adenocarcinoma, most consistent with origin from Muellerian duct.
Her pleural effusions were tapped and pleural fluid analysis were consistent with exudate and cytology was preliminarily positive for malignancy.
She bit through the ET tube cuff pilot line on hospital day 6, and was extubated without complication.
# Septic Shock:  Patient was started on vancomycin and cefepime for presumed hospital acquired pneumonia.
Echocardiogram demonstrated normal ejection fraction with no focal wall motion abnormalities.
# Elevated troponin: Likely demand ischemia in the setting of sepsis.
No changes suggestive on infarct on EKG, no all motion abnormalities on echo.
# Intermittent Hypoxia: combination of recurrent effusions, CHF, and HCAP.
# Recurrent effusions: malignant.
She had evidence of reaccumulation.
If her pulmonary disease is due to her peritoneal disease, paracentesis may need to be considered........... .
# CHF: right- and left- sided.
Echocardiogram had shown a hypokinetic/dilated right ventricle and she has JVD/LE edema and in addition to these signs of RHF she also likely has pulmonary edema.
Upon arrival to the Oncology floor, given her recent fever, hypoxia, and unresolved leukocytosis she was restarted on Vanc/Cefepime ([**4-1**]) and Flagyl was added to cover for anaerobes in the case of aspiration.
# Leukocytosis/Fever: likely HCAP but evaluated for other causes as well.
IP requested avoiding anti-inflammatory meds as the inflammation is necessary for success of pleurodesis.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Pre-renal.
# Hypertension: BP reasonably controlled.
On transfer from the ICU to the floor, she was mildy hypertensive and diovan 80mg PO daily was started.
# Ovarian cancer: metastatic serous adenocarcinoma.
CT abdomen/pelvis without contrast at [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital on [**2192-3-8**] showed ascites but no definite disease; however, this was a very limited study secondary to lack of contrast.
Palliative chemo with carbotaxol is a possibility; while her respiratory status was tenuous this was not pursued.
