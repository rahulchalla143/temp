Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy [**2190-12-20**]: no endobronchial lesions.
BAL: Bronchial cells and many pulmonary macrophages.
TBNA bx: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS  BM bx [**2190-12-17**]: consistent with possible myeloproliferative disorder.
History of Present Illness: The patient is an 83M with a history of CHF (with diastolic dysfunction, EF>55%), first degree AV block ([**Month/Day/Year 4448**] placed [**5-18**]), intermittent atrial fibrillation, RA on chronic prednisone, and diabetes, who now presents with decreased po intake, increased fatigue, weight loss, insomnia, and chronic intractable hiccups.
His w/u during the last admission included chest/Ab CT that showed hilar and paraaortic lymphadeopathy, and an abdominal ultrasound that was suspicious for cirrhosis.
The pt took 3 doses of compazine but has had no relief.
He has not noted any other changes or complaints over this period time.
Pt's BP improved to 95/50s, but no higher.
On ROS, he denies headache, fever, chills, night sweats, noctruria, hematuria, flank pain, abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, chest pain, shortness of breath, focal weakness.
He has had worsening vision over the past week, has no sense of smell.
Asymptomatic AV dissociation and bradycardia s/p [**Company 1543**] Sigma 300 DR [**Last Name (STitle) 4448**] placement [**5-18**].
Holter [**2187**]: SR w/ moderate PR prolongation, AEA w/ runs of atrial tachycardia, 2 beat run of VT 2.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus 3.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy s/p TURP-- path w/ prostate ca [**Doctor Last Name **] 3+3 = 6 4.
Diverticulosis with colonic polyp (c-scope [**2186**]).
Recent circumcision for balontitis 9.
Cirrhosis (consistent findings on recent ultrasound, but not seen on CT abdomen [**11-24**])   Social History: The patient lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) **] Corner.
No history of other drug use.
No palpable cervical or suproclavicular LAD.
No thyromegaly.
Cor - distant HS, RRR, S1/S2, [**3-21**] SM heard best at LLSB Resp: CTA bilaterally, no w/r/r/c Ab - soft, nontender, mildly distended, NABS.
No splenomegaly appreciated.
No masses, rebound, guarding, no bruits.
Ext - 2+ pitting edema in RLE, 1+ edema in LLE.
Extensive lymphadenopathy is seen within the mediastinum and in the retroperitoneum.
There are several areas of hypodensity within the spleen.
These are hard to compare to the prior study secondary to differences in the phase of contrast enhancement.
These may represent real lesions and correlation with ultrasound is recommended.
Several peripheral areas of faint ground-glass opacity are seen, which are peripheral distribution, greater in the right lung than the left.
These are new in comparison to the prior study, and may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema, or infectious process or lymphoma.
Spleen U/S [**2190-12-16**]:Enlarged spleen with innumerable hypodense lesions.
L knee AP and Lateral [**2190-12-20**]: 1.
No acute bony injury.
Small lucency at the tibia-prosthesis interface in the medial compartment.
Comparison with remote prior examinations, which are not currently available, recommended to assess for interval change.
UNILATERAL UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND [**12-21**]: No DVT.
CXR [**12-22**]:IMPRESSION: Minimal patchy left basilar opacity, most likely due to atelectasis.
Follow-up radiograph may be helpful to exclude early pneumonia.
CT neck and LUE [**12-23**]: prelim read showing crhonic occlusion of RIJV with abnormal filling of L subclavian and L branchiocephalic veins, awaitin gfinal report.

Also with worrisome intra-abdominal and mediastinal lymphadeopathy due to unknown cause, continually elevated alkaline phosphatase, hyponatremia, ARF.
Given concern for infection and early sepsis on admission, the pt was treated with vancomycin/aztreonam, given IV fluid resuscitation to support his BP, and transferred to the MICU.
In the MICU he remained afebrile and studies were negative for a source of infection.
Concerning for systemic disease given recent symptoms of anorexia, weight loss, fatigue.
Lung CA, colon CA, HCC, cholangioCA, lymphoma were on our ddx, though no lymphoblastic predominance or abnormal forms on peripheral blood smear.
- given splenic findings, heme/once was consulted, performed BM bx on [**12-17**] that was consistent with a possible myeloproliferative disorder (?CML) and not explanatory for his FTT - the interventional pulmonary service performed a BAL and TBNA on [**12-20**] that was also non-diagnostic, returning negative for malignancy cells - thoracic surgery has arranged for an outpatient appointment on [**12-28**] at which the pt and his family can learn about the risks and benefits of mediastinoscopy as the next step in attempt to get a tissue diagnosis.
- in the future, liver bx or colonoscopy might be options to evaluated primary source, given pt's h/o cirrhosis of unknown etiology and h/o colonic polyp that was not resected and not f/u.
# LUE edema.
two days after admission the pt's PIV in the L arm infiltrated and he had the onset of 2+ pitting edema in the hand and arm all the way up to the shoulder.
He did not complain of any pain or discomfort.
There was an area of erythema on the volar side of his forearm which was concerning for cellulitis, but the pt's temp and white count remained normal, the area of erythma resolvesd, and there was no evidence of fluctuance.
The edema itself improved over 2-3 days, then increased again to 2+ pitting on [**12-20**].
LUE u/s done [**12-21**] was negative for DVT, and CT of the neck and LUE was done on [**12-23**] to rule out an obstructing lesion.
Due to suspicion of sepsis he was treated with vancomycin/aztreonam.
Can not attribute leukocytosis to any one underlying cause, may be due to steroid therapy, hidden infection, myeloproliferative disorder, unknown underlying malignancy.
- pt was given stress dose steroid peri-bronchoscopy and responded well - throughout his admission, he was monitored for signs of infection; his pulmonary status and abdominal exam remained stable throughout.
He had a few low grade temperatures (highest 100.1) but was never with high fevers.
Further shock/sepsis workup was negative, including ROMI x3, CXR no PNA, UA negative, UCx no growth.
It was decided that 100s/50s was the pt's new baseline BP given his FTT and ?
- BCx came back final with no growth, UCx were also negative throughout his stay, 1x UCx pending on admission because of low grade temp 100.1 on [**12-22**].
# Diastolic CHF.
No crackles on admit exam, minimal peripheral edema.
He had crakcles on two independent days during this admission but never showed extreme clinical signs of R sided volume overload.
- his antihypertensives were held throughout this admission due to hypotension - he had a foley catheter to monitor urine output, it was d/c'd on [**12-22**] - CXR [**12-15**] showed improved CHF and no PNA, CXR [**12-22**] showed some atelectasis - pt was diuresed with lasix on [**12-16**] and [**12-21**], then restarted on his po home regimen of lasix 80 mg qd and spironolactone 25mg po qd.
40 lbs weight loss over the past 6 months.
- Pt's care team thought that the best way to treat the FTT was to w/u GI adenopathy and look for etiology of weight loss and anorexia, which was likely also related to hiccups.
He did not have any acute mental status changes or symptoms of hyponatremia.
# Hiccups.
Could be secondary to hyponatremia as mentioned over last admission.
[**Month (only) 116**] also be due to diaphragmatic or phrenic nerve irritation from the intra-abdominal or intra-thoracic process that is causing the adenopathy.
Central cause of intractable hiccups has not been r/o as pt has not had a recent head CT. - compazine was given prn for hiccups, they resolved halfway through his hospital course .
# S/P fall.
Pt had fall while trying to get out of bed overnight on [**12-19**], fell onto both of his knees, no LOC, no head trauma.
On exam there was edema and erythema of L knee, with ternderness to palpation but normal ROM.
Pt has h/o TKR on L.  Plain films revealed no fx, no dislocation.
Pt was placed on fall precautions and had no further episodes.
# Depression.
- started celexa 10mg po qd [**12-18**], did not have a decrease in his serum sodium after starting SSRI - mood did not improve over the course of his stay, would recommend outpatient f/u with [**Female First Name (un) **] psych, social work, or end-of-life care if he continues to deteriorate.
# Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase an Total bilirubin.
Past ultrasound suspicious for cirrhosis, but no comment on GB pathology.
Unsure what the etiology of his cirrhosis is given no past h/o methotrexate treatment for RA, no reason to suspect hemochromatosis or Wilson's disease, no h/o _ hep serologies, unlikely autoimmune given pt's age, and unlikely HCC given normal appearance on CT scan.
# Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 - RISS was used for management until [**12-21**] - started home dose of glargine 15U qam [**12-21**] + RISS - sugars remained reasonably well-controlled throughout his stay .
# Rheumatoid Arthritis,Pseudogout.
# Ppx.
- PPI was given for stress ulcer prophylaxis - Sc heparin was given for DVT prophylaxis .
# Dispo.
It was unclear whether or not Mr. [**Known lastname **] and his family are on the same page re:hunting for a diagnosis.
The care team met with the family on [**12-17**] and again on [**12-22**] to discuss plan for diagnosis and tests.
