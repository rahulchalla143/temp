Admission Date: [**2186-4-24**]        Discharge Date: [**2186-5-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2147-9-24**]        Sex:  F  Service:  PSU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 38-year-old female three years status post right lumpectomy and axillary dissection and chemotherapy and radiation now diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ in the right breast on needle localization of a mammographically-located microcalcifications here at [**Hospital6 2018**].
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hyperthyroidism treated with radioactive iodine and the above breast cancer described.
General: She was generally a well-appearing woman in no apparent distress.
Heart: Regular, rate, and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Breasts: There was a scar from a right lumpectomy with volume loss consistent with surgery, and there were no dominant masses noted on palpation.
She had no adenopathy.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and received 5.7 L of Crystalloid fluid, and her estimated blood loss was 250 ml.
In the immediate postoperative period, there was noted loss of Doppler signal over the SIEA flap requiring an immediate return to the operating room.
The patient was intensive care unit at this time being monitored carefully, and heparin drip was started at 500 units/hour with checks of PTT to make sure that she not in a supratherapeutic range, and plan was to keep the body in room temperature, warm.
The patient was receiving IV cephazolin at this point for prophylactic coverage.
The plan was for possible return to the operating room for debridement versus excision of tissue that could possibly become nonviable, and on [**2186-4-30**], postoperative day #6, the patient was without complaint and was being monitored closely for any signs of infection or imminent sloughing of the flap.
On postoperative day #7, the patient that she was feeling better, and that her pain was very well controlled, and she was tolerating a diet.
There was some blistering and some signs of congestion, but the flap did not look to be in imminent concern at this time.
Thus there was a question of whether we were dealing with epidermolysis versus deeper tissue necrosis and whether there would be need for return to the operating room due to the equivocal nature of our exam.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to call the ER or return to the surgery clinic if she experiences increased pain, swelling, bleeding, discharge from the wounds, fevers, chills, nausea or vomiting, or if there are any questions or concerns.
