No blood or mucus in the stool.
He has not had any sick contacts, foreign travel (only recently went to [**Location (un) 7349**]), no camping.
No changes in medications or new antibiotics recently.
His diarrhea has continued despite these measures.
He has no abd pain, no nausea or vomiting.
+ low grade fevers but  chills.
No dark urine.
No night sweats.
He notes a 13 lb weight loss since [**2-29**].
He has not taken any meds for the bloating or diarrhea until recently, when Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] told him to take Imodium.
[**1-21**]: Initial presentation of malignancy:  Pt had a routine physcial at his PCP's office that showed pancytopenia.
He was admitted to [**Hospital **] hospital where a bone marrow showed acute myelogenous leukemia.
He had not noticed any bleeding, fevers, chills, night sweats, HA, weight loss, or shortness of breath.
Cytogenetics were abnormal with multiple structural and numerical aberrations.
Among these are a missing 7 and 21, a deletion of 5q, additional material of undetermined origin on 17q, and 4 to 5 structurally abnormal markers.
A repeat marrow on day +20 showed a hypocellular marrow with young cells that were thought to be of normal maturation.
His peripheral smear continued to show blasts and on day +28, his marrow was re-biopsied.
This showed a increase in the number of blast forms without maturation.
He had no mucositis or CNS dysfunction His repeat marrow on day +14 of re-induction showed 95% cellular  bone marrow comprised almost exclusively of immature cells, consistent with myeloblasts.
His counts were monitored closely to see if he would return with MDS or persistent AML.
He also developed a PNA during this admission.
[**2175-2-17**] cytogenetics: 49,[**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **](5)(q11.2q33),-7,add(17)(q25),-21,+[**2-18**][cp19]/46,XY[1]; This abnormal karyotype shows multiple structural and numerical aberrations.
Among these are a missing 7 and 21, a deletion of 5q, additional material of undetermined origin on 17q, and 4 to 5 structurally abnormal marker .
[**Hospital1 18**]: Patient was admitted [**Date range (3) 61438**] for neutropenic fever.
No fever source was identified on that admission.
[**Date range (1) 61439**]/05: Hospitalization at [**Location (un) **]: febrile neutropenia .
per pt, febrile neutropenia .
at [**Location (un) **]: Staph epi bacteremia, on Vanco/Cefepime, febrile neutropenia .
The patient had a positive CMV viral load on [**2175-10-11**] at 1,600 copies (previous negative on [**10-7**]).
CMV viremia   Social History: no tobacco, though smoked pipes in college X 2 years, no etoh, no IVDA.
Family History: No fHX of Leukemia or lymphoma.
+ bitemporal wasting.
MM dry, OP clear w/o lesions Neck: No lad, no jvd Lungs: CTAB CV: RRR S1 and S2 audible w/o m/r/g Abd: Soft, NT, ND, NABS, No masses.
[**2175-2-22**] BM Bx: Cellular myeloid-dominant marrow with markedly left-shifted myelopoiesis and increased myeloblasts (day 20 status post myeloblative chemotherapy) Note: Although myeloblasts appear increased on the hemodilute aspirate smear, an accurate count can not be determined due to poor specimen quality.
Immunophenotypic findings c/w involvement by AML w/an immature phenotype.
[**3-18**] BM Bx: biopsy consists of blood, cortical bone, and a few fragments of > 95% cellular bone marrow comprised almost exclusively of immature cells, consistent with myeloblasts.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
No pleural effusions are visualized.
IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe pneumonia.
Compared to prior study, the left lower lobe opacity appears slightly worse.
There has also been interval increase in right lower lobe opacity, consistent with pneumonia.
[**4-9**] CXR IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-4**] and 24: Bibasilar pneumonia is clearing.
There is no appreciable pleural effusion.
Mediastinal widening at the thoracic inlet due to combination of adenopathy and fat deposition and tortuous vessels is longstanding.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Persistent bilateral lower lobe consolidations, also with patchy lingular involvement.
The degree of consolidation is increased at the right base.
Diffuse edema of the descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum with consistent with colitis.
Less likely is ischemia as the abdominal vasculature is widely patent.
Inflammatory bowel disease is also less likely.
No evidence for pulmonary embolus.
Bilateral airspace consolidation within the lower lobes, left greater than right, consistent with pneumonia.
Cholelithiasis without evidence for cholecystitis with mild central biliary ductal dilatation.
CT HEAD [**4-9**] FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
No mass effect.
No shift of normally midline structures.
Note is made of right carotid artery calcification.
There is fluid in bilateral ethmoid sinuses, representing sinusitis.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
CT CHEST [**4-19**] IMPRESSION: Improving of the bilateral lower lobe consolidation   Brief Hospital Course: 59 y/o gentleman with h/o AML day 217 post allo SCT (HLA matched sibling) presents with 3.5 week h/o diarrhea, 13 lb weight loss, decr po intake.
His course was complicated by bilateral lower lobe PNA requiring an admission to the ICU.
He was started on levaquin, however, his PNA worsened with chest CT the following day showing bilateral lower lobe consolidations.
Bilateral lower lobe PNA:  being covered with Cefepime/Flagyl/Voriconazole.
Pt most likely has bacterial PNA given appearance with air bronchograms/consolidation seen on Chest CT.  Less likely CMV PNA or MRSA PNA, although was recently hospitalized in [**Location (un) **], CT.  Vancomycin discontinued and added back X 2, but now discontinued.
He was being covered with Azithro for Legionella PNA though Legionella urinary ag negative while in the ICU but this was discontinued [**4-12**] after [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] call out.
Continued Voriconazole for antifungal coverage.
Less likely osmotic diarrhea, medication induced, or inflammatory.
OSH report showing rectal ulcerations, biopsy: no cytopathic effect.
GI was consulted for possible colonoscopy with biopsy, but given improvement in diarrhea, colonoscopy was deferred.
# Anxiety/Depression: Continued on outpatient Ritalin, Desipramine, and Escitilopram .
Incidentaloma: CT Chest on [**2176-4-19**] showed low-density right kidney lesion which should be evaluated with ultrasound to exclude the possibility of complex cyst or malignancy.
Patient without flank pain or renal insufficiency.
Dressing PICC dressing care and changes per protocol   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 5065**] Healthcare  Discharge Diagnosis: Bilateral lower lobe pneumonia, presumed bacterial Diarrhea post-transplant CMV Hypertension   Discharge Condition: diarrhea resolved, sat'ing well on room air   Discharge Instructions: 1.
If you experience fevers, chills, diarrhea, difficulty breathing, or any other concerning signs/symptoms, please contact the BMT fellow or report to the Emergency Department  Followup Instructions: As instructed, please report to 7Feldberg on Thursday at 10 AM to meet with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**].
