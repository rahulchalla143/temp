She was recently admitted to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital on [**2173-1-12**] for progressive cough and weakness and was found to have an enlarging right hilar mass, with associated pleural effusion and a thoracentesis that yielded positive cytology.
She was considering palliative chemotherapy, but unfortunately she has become progressively weaker, with increasing and disturbing cough - productive of sputum lately, and with worsening dyspnea.
She denies any fevers or chills.
She was started on antibiotics (Zosyn) at OSH for a possible postobstructive pneumonia.
During her hospital stay in [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital she was also found to have recurrent SVTs with reentry, atrial flutter/fibrillation in/out that had been partially responsive to iv diltiazem.
She denies any chest pain.
She is now being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]/Interventional Pulmonology service for evaluation of her airway and possible stent or other symptom relief procedure.
Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Rheumatoid arthritis Lung cancer - stage IIIb NSCLC, which has been in remission for three years.
SURGICAL HISTORY:  She has had both hands operated on for ligamentous issues secondary to her rheumatoid arthritis.
She has also had her right foot reconstructed secondary to rheumatoid arthritis in [**2164**].
Family History: Significant for cancer of her father and two brothers, all lung cancer.
Also, lung disease in general runs in the family.
Physical Exam: VS 99.8  84  108/66  20  99 3.5L NC Gen: NAD, A&O x3 CV: RRR Chest: b/l diffuse wheezes, decreased BS at right base Abd: soft, nondistended Ext: WWP  Pertinent Results: CT chest [**2173-2-26**]: 1.
Following bronchus intermedius stent placement, persistent airway obstruction distal to the stent, with minimally aerosolized material, as well as encasement/marked narrowing of the right pulmonary artery.
Pronounced post- obstructive collapse of the right middle and right lower lobe, which has increased from the prior study.
Pronounced volume loss is evidenced by increased rightward mediastinal shift and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
Interval decrease in right pleural fluid following placement of pleural catheter at the right lung base.
Unchanged appearance of right suprahilar consolidative opacity and right upper lobe and anterior left upper lobe lung masses.
Stable appearance of hepatic cyst and small hepatic lesions in the right lobe.
Still present right perihilar consolidation and right basal consolidation represents a combination of known lung cancer, atelectasis and potentially post-obstructive infection.
There is no pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2173-2-24**] and underwent flexible bronchoscopy on [**2-25**] which deomonstrated tumor invasion of the right mainstem bronchus and right bronchus intermedius.
She was continued on unasyn for treatment of presumed postobstructive pneumonia and an admission WBC of 17.
On [**2-28**] she underwent rigid bronchoscopy for further tumor debridement and was taken back later that day for flexible bronchoscopy and further tumor debridement a second time.
Postoperatively she was tachypneic and tachycardic and O2 saturations were transiently in the 50%s on room air; she was placed on CPAP noninvasive ventilation and O2 saturations rose quickly to the high 90%s.
ABG at that time revealed significant respiratory acidosis with 7.13/80/71, and she was planned for admission to SICU.
Overnight she did well, however CXR in the AM of [**3-1**] demonstrated collapse of the right upper lobe and a right pleural effusion.
Her PleurX catheter was drained and she had some symptomatic relief of symptoms.
She also underwent a flexible bronchoscopy at the bedside which reportedly did not reveal any abnormality, with the stent in good place.
Her WBC count was down to 13 and she was afebrile throughout the admission.
Benzonatate 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for severe cough.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every 4-6 hours as needed for anxiety.
Lidocaine (PF) 10 mg/mL (1 %) Solution Sig: 2.5 MLs Injection Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for coughing.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 8300**] Hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: Stage IV non small-cell lung cancer   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Please do not hesitate to contact Dr.[**Name (NI) 5070**] office or come to the emergency room if you have any acute care concerns, such as fevers/chills, nausea/vomiting, or sudden onset shortness of breath.
