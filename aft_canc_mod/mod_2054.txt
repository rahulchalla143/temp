She is being admitted for hypotension on day +8 after underwent AraC/Idarubicin induction [**2169-8-30**].
She was subsequently admitted [**Date range (2) 36123**] for febrile neutropenia and pseudomonal sepsis.
Day 22 BM biopsy [**2169-11-30**] showed persistant disease.
She has an erythematous papular rash on her nose that she states is not new for her and is not pruritic or painful - feels this is irritation from tissues for runny nose.
She denies any localizing symptoms such as headache, neck pain, chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, or dysuria.
She was first diagnosed with gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in [**2158**].
She relapsed in [**2164**] and was found to have diffuse disease in the supraclavicular nodes and mediastinum.
After the transplant, she did well until [**2169-6-1**] when she was admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital with symptoms consistent with pneumonia.
Bone marrow biopsy after resolution of the pneumonia showed myelodysplastic syndrome with increased blasts (5-10% with trilineage dysplasia), thought to be [**3-5**] her prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and stem cell transplant.Chromosomal studies revealed chromosome abnormalities of deletion 5, 7 and 20. .
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was readmitted for persistent fevers on [**2169-8-4**] and was noted to have increasing blasts in her peripheral blood.
Bone marrow biopsy [**10-26**] showed recurrence of leukemia.
Gastric DLBCL (Diffuse Large B cell lymphoma) from supraclavicular L/N in [**2158**] with relapse in [**2165**], s/p adriamycin  tx, 2 cycles of CHOP, 2 cycles of RICE tx, s/p autologous stem cell transplant in 3/[**2165**].
Relapsed gastric lymphoma s/p partial  gastrectomy with chemotherapy.
Chronic systolic heart failure (EF 30-40%), recently evaluated by cardiology; thought to be secondary to a previous asymptomatic inferoposterior wall MI (distribution of injury not consistent with cardiomyopathy secondary to anthracycline toxicity).
Had a P-Mibi for further evaluation which confirmed moderate perfusion defect of PDA territory and medium sized, severe perfusion defect of LAD territory as well as severe systolic dysfunction.
Family History: Father had heart failure and mother had diabetes.
Physical Exam: VITAL SIGNS - T 99.3, BP 101/63, RR 20, HR 92, 100%RA GENERAL - Well-appearing female NAD, comfortable HEENT - NC/AT, PERRLA, [**Country 3899**], sclerae anicteric, MMM, OP clear NECK - Supple, no thyromegaly, no JVD, no carotid bruits LUNGS - CTA bilat, no r/rh/wh, good air movement, resp unlabored, no accessory muscle use HEART - RRR, no MRG, nl S1/S2 ABDOMEN - NABS, soft/NT/ND, no masses or HSM, no rebound/guarding EXTREMITIES - WWP, no c/c/e, 2+ peripheral pulses (radials, DPs)  SKIN - Maculopapular rash on nose; several macules, dark red in color, on dorsal surface of feet bilaterally NEURO - Awake, A&Ox3, CNs II-XII grossly intact, muscle strength [**6-5**] throughout, sensation grossly intact throughout  Pertinent Results: Chest radiograph, portable ([**2169-12-4**]): In comparison with study of [**11-16**], allowing for the portable technique, there is little change.
Specifically, there is no evidence of acute pneumonia.
Immunophenotyping ([**2169-12-6**]): Immunophenotypic findings consistent with peripheral blood CD34/CD33 positive myeloblasts.
Improvement of pulmonary interstitial edema and decrease in the size of pleural effusions from prior CT study.
Foci of ground-glass opacity in the left upper lobe are stable-to-slightly improved and probably are also part of the same process.
No evidence of pneumonia.
Bone marrow biopsy ([**2169-12-21**]): HYPOCELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH EXTENSIVE FIBROSIS, MARROW REGENERATION AND INCREASED MYELOBLASTS.
Though a significant population of maturing erythroid and myeloid precursors are present, immature, non-clustered cells consistent with blasts comprise at least 10% of marrow cellularity.
The findings are consistent with marrow regeneration with persistent involvement by acute leukemia.
Chest radiograph, 2-view ([**2169-12-29**]): Minimal right perihilar atelectasis.
No evidence for pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo F with AML admitted with fever and neutropenia, noted to have persistent leukemic involvement of bone marrow, who underwent allogeneic SCT during this hospitalization.
She  had a very complicated hospital course including fever and neutropenia, acute graft-versus-host disease, thalamic stroke, CMV Viremia, and multiple UTIs.
She underwent immunophenotyping on admission and was found to have persistent AML.
A bone marrow biopsy on [**2169-12-21**] again showed marrow regeneration with persistent involvement by acute leukemia.
Another bone marror biopsy was performed on [**1-16**], which revealed a hypocellular bone marrow and <5% blasts.
On [**3-19**], her bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence of residual leukemia.
She was treated with gancyclovir, but continued to have persistent CMV infection.
Repeat bone marrow biopsy showed persistent blasts, (20-30%) consistent with recurrent leukemia.
Hemorrhagic Stroke:  The patient had a hemorrhagic stroke on [**2-14**], in the setting of low platelets and conditioning chemotherapy.
Neurology performed a 24 hour EEG which did not show any evidence of seizure activity.
They felt that her mental status was the natural progression of her thalamic stroke.
She had continued R side deficit, but was starting to regain some movement in her R leg.
The patient remained asymptommatic, and no etiology was found.
In early [**Month (only) 1096**], the patient had a CT chest which revealed bilateral bronchopneumonia.
A BAL was performed on [**1-3**], which did not show any evidence of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], Mycobacteria, or viral etiologies.
The patient remained afebrile, and her antibiotics were gradually discontinued, with the exception of Micafungin (changed from Posaconazole secondary to rising LFTs), Acyclovir, and Vancomycin.
The Tobramycin was later discontinued and the patient has remained afebrile to date.
She was doing well and then at the end of [**Month (only) **] was found to have UTI and treated with meropenem and CMV viremia and treated with gancyclovir.
She then started having fevers persistently, and was found to have a VRE UTI and was started on daptomycin.
# Pulmonary Edema:  From [**1-3**] through [**1-10**] the patients weight increased to 118lbs as she was placed on IVF for SBP as low as 70s.
In the setting of BNPs 15 - 35K, pulmonary edema on CXR, the patient was placed on a lasix drip each time with subsequent improvements in her BP.
During hospital course she experienced episodes of hypotension when maintenance fluids were stopped requiring continuation at low rate (75 cc/hour).
In particular, she had three episodes of systolic BP in 70s; she remained asymptomatic in all episodes, and all episodes resolved with small fluid bolus (e.g.
In early [**Month (only) 1096**] the patient was found to be hypotensive to the 70s in the setting of fevers and subsequently was sent to the unit on each occasion.
The patient was noted to have an elevated BNP ranging from 15K to 35K in the setting of increased 02 requirement to 4L NC, crackles on exam, pulmonary edema on CXR, and the patients weight at 118lbs up from 110lbs on admission.
The patient subsequently remained normotensive with pressures ranging systolically from 90s to 120s.
Chest Pain: The patient with known LAD and PDA defects.
On [**1-27**] the patient developed [**9-10**] substernal chest pressure while ambulating.
Cards was c/s and stated that the patient would not be a candidate for cardiac catheterization of POBA, as she is unable to take Plavix or ASA long-term.
Has had no recurrent CP since that time.
# Elevated LFTs:  Patient had a mild recurrent transaminitis.
Posaconazole was changed to Micofungin as a possible source for elevated transaminases, and a RUQ U/S was performed which showed stones in the gallbladder and CBD.
She also had some rise in AP/bili in [**Month (only) 958**] and was started on treatment for GVHD for liver and gut involvement as she was having diarrhea.
A steroid course was initiated and tapered off as diarrhea and LFTs improved.
A J-tube was placed as the patient had a past partial gastrectomy for a gastric cancer.
After the J-tube placement she developed bilious emesis.
A barium study revealed an obstruction above the site of the J-tube, but the J-tube itself and distal bowel was unobstructed.
Her tube feeds were resumed with a forluma that did not require pancreatic enzymes or bile.
An NG tube was placed to suction her gastric secretions and bile.
Evenutally the NG tube fell out, but she had no more emesis and the SBO must have resolved on it's own.
# GI bleed - had coffee ground emesis in late [**Month (only) 116**], likely from a gastritis.
We started her on [**Hospital1 **] protonix for now and she has no more episodes.
Hemorrhagic thalamic stroke 3.
Small bowel obstruction 4.
Hyperkalemia   Discharge Condition: Expired  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital in Novemeber for AML.
During prepartion for your stem cell transplant, you had a stroke which caused you to have some right side weakness and made you very somnulent for many many days.
You also had a small bowel obstruction which resolved on its own.
Unfortunately, a repeat bone marrow biopsy showed recurrent leukemia.
