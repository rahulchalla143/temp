Admission Date:  [**2129-8-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-8-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2088-5-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: EMERGENCY  Allergies: Ambisome / Penicillins / Cefepime  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2565**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxemia, tachypnea   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: L IJ Central line placed  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) **] is a 41 year-old female with AML status post HIDAC and MRD allo-[**Name14 (STitle) 3242**] [**9-/2127**] with remission but subsequent relapse with CNS involvement in [**1-/2129**] treated with XRT and IT MEC chemo with eventual remission.
She presented again in [**7-/2129**] with HC and elevated ICP, and VP shunt was placed.
She was readmitted on [**2129-8-1**] from clinic with altered mental status and low-grade fever.
Work-up further revealed bilateral hilar infiltrates on CXR, with preserved saturation at presentation.
Subsequent imaging included CT chest which showed bilateral ground glass opacities with upper lobe predominance.
Pulmonary was consulted, and bronchoscopy performed on [**2129-8-4**] showed thin secretions, but was otherwise largely underwhelming.
A BAL grew no organisms, and rapid viral screen was negative.
On the floor, she developed a new oxygen requirement on [**2129-8-7**] of 2L via NC.
Repeat imaging studies also showed progression of infiltrates, and concern was raised over possible PCP (last inhaled Pentamidine dose [**2129-7-14**]).
She transiently defervesced on the floor, but developed progressive hypoxemia with increasing oxygen requirement to 6L NC, then shovel mask, and eventually NRB.
Other issues on the floor have included hyponatremia with nadir to 122, with elevated UOsm and UNa suggestive of SIADH.
The cholecystitis perforated, resulting in emergent open chole complicated by fistula and bleeding and 2 month stay in MICU.
- [**2127-11-10**] repeat marrow showed a markedly hypercellular marrow with no blast clusters and CD34+ blasts comprising less than 3% of the cellularity.
- [**2127-12-4**] started Consolidation with four cycles of HIDAC - [**2127**]: bone marrow biopsy later shows relapsed acute leukemia.
Marrow bx after day 30 did show evidence of recovering marrow without a clear increase in blasts although there were some monocyte precursors noted.
- [**2129-1-14**]: admission for relapsed leukemia in the CSF and R bell's palsy.
Base of skull XRT and intrathecal chemotherapy through an ommaya reservoir ([**2129-1-7**]) placed during her admission - [**Date range (1) 57171**]: continued on q2week Depo ARA-C, also with withdrawing immunosuppression.
Hepatitis C: HCV Ab positive [**2-/2128**], VL [**4-9**] 22,100,000, liver biopsy in [**2-7**] with stage 1-2 fibrosis and bile duct damage likely [**1-6**] hep C but cannot exclude GVHD 8.
GERD 10. h/o coag neg staph, VRE  Social History: She presently is living in [**Hospital6 **] home.
Family History: No family history of malignancy.
Her mother has hypertension, her father had type II diabetes and died from an MI and stroke at the age of 57, and her brother has HIV.
GEN: Tachypneic, unable to speak with full sentences in moderate respiratory distress.
JVP difficult to assess secondary to respiratory distress.
Pertinent Results: Laboratory results: [**2129-8-1**] 11:40AM   UREA N-13 CREAT-0.6 SODIUM-133 POTASSIUM-4.9 CHLORIDE-102 TOTAL CO2-22 ANION GAP-14 [**2129-8-1**] 11:40AM   WBC-6.4# RBC-3.73* HGB-12.7 HCT-38.5 MCV-103* MCH-34.0* MCHC-33.1 RDW-16.7* [**2129-8-1**] 11:40AM   NEUTS-66.7 LYMPHS-25.9 MONOS-4.9 EOS-1.9 BASOS-0.5 [**2129-8-1**] 11:40AM   CALCIUM-8.7 PHOSPHATE-2.1* MAGNESIUM-1.9 URIC ACID-2.6 [**2129-8-1**] 11:40AM   ALT(SGPT)-45* AST(SGOT)-93* LD(LDH)-236 CK(CPK)-20* ALK PHOS-352* TOT BILI-3.8* DIR BILI-2.5* INDIR BIL-1.3 [**2129-8-1**] 03:36PM   LACTATE-1.3  RELEVANT IMAGING DATA: [**2129-8-3**] CT CHEST W/O: Multiple focal areas of ground-glass opacity in both lungs and peribronchial infiltration are more prominent in the upper lobes, and confluent in the left apex.
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
[**2129-8-7**] CT CHEST W/O: Worsening diffuse bilateral patchy ground glass opacities with an upper lobe predominance.
This appearance is most consistent with an atypical infection such as PCP or viral pneumonia, as noted previously.
They have progressed to a moderate degree in the left mid lung field and lower lung field whereas on the right base, a certain degree of regression can be identified.
On both films, there is no evidence of pleural fluid accumulation in the lateral pleural sinuses.
[**2129-8-10**] CXR portable: Increase bilateral airspace opacities with decreased lung volumes  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 41 year-old female with AML in remission, with progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure.
1) Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The cause of her acute respiratory decompensation was unclear to the housestaff team.
Within the first day or two of her admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] there was a drastic change in her cxray.
She now had multilobular opacities suggestive of an ARDs like picture.
No nidus of infection was found and all culture data was negative.
The pt was extremely difficult to ventilation requiring high PEEP and pressure support.
Abdominal paracentesis showed blasts in her abdomen suggesting reoccurence of her cancer.
This is most likely the cause of her acute failure.
2) Hemodynamic instability: Patient was persistently hypotensive during her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay.
She initially required Levophed to maintain her urine output and blood pressure but Dopamine was added in hope to wean the Levophed down.
3) Abdominal distention: Patient required extremely high amounts of Fentanyl and Versed to keep her sedated and synchronous with the ventilator.
Her abdomen continued to increase in size, thought to be an ileus due to failure of passing stool (secondary to pain medications).
4) Thrombocytopenia: Likely secondary to possible underlying malignancy.
