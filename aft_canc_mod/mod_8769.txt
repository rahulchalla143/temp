NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to       hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..    FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2147-3-12**]):    NO GROWTH.
Approximately 12 cc of clear fluid were collected.
The patient tolerated the procedure well without any immediate complications.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 49 female with PMH of metastatic colon cancer, ESRD on peritoneal dialysis presents with recurrent fever, hypotension, nausea and vomiting.
DDX initially included pneumonia vs peritoneal cavity vs urine vs line infection but no evidence of any of these.
Presentation with nausea and vomiting consistent with a viral gastroenteritis.
Symptoms resolved with aggressive rehydration and seem most consistent with a self-limiting viral gastroenteritis.
Afebrile for 48 hours prior to discharge.
# Hypotension: DDX septic shock vs cardiogenic vs hypovolemic.
Initially considered to be most consistent with septic shock based on CVP being low and fever.
Given rapid improvement after volume resuscitation with little evidence for persistent infection, likely hypovolemia from vomiting and diarrhea and prolonged poor po intake.
# ESRD on peritoneal dialysis, s/p transplant: Renal following.
# Anemia: Anemic at baseline likely due to chronic kidney disease.
# Metastatic colon cancer: Was to have a large volume LP the day of admission by IR to evaluate for meningeal spread in setting of bulbar palsy.
Only work-up remaining on discharge was large volume LP for cytology, though leptomeningeal spread from colon cancer is exceedingly rare.
Large volume LP performed by Interventional Neuroradiology [**3-9**] without complication.
Given inability to eat larger quantities of food, and with complaint of weight loss, she was given supplemental shakes while inpatient.
ENT re-evaluated patient while in the hospital and reported no interval improvement.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Metastatic colon cancer, sepsis Secondary: End Stage Renal Disease, prior renal transplant   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable and afebrile.
