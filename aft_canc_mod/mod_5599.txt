SBP dropped to 80's, started peripheral fluid boluses.
Patient evaluated by both surgery and GI, taken for ERCP which showed gallstones and sludge.
Of note, micro growing E Coli and coag neg staph in blood.
Metastatic breast cancer, left breast, status post lumpectomy, now on faslodex; no chemotherapy or radiation per patient's wishes [**2129**] 2.
Vascular dementia 3.
COPD with frequent pneumonias 5.
RBBB, history of Wenkebach, 2:1 AV block 6.
History of diverticulitis 7.
Chronic constipation 8.
History of bleeding gastric ulcer 12.
She does not walk and is wheelchair bound.
Physical Exam: VS: 100.9 88 136/70 20 GEN: Elderly women lying in bed, breathing comfortably, in no acute distress.
No rebound, guarding.

ESCHERICHIA COLI.
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2132-9-23**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Sludge and possibly small stones are seen within the common duct.
Pneumobilia in the left lobe of the liver, possibly related to prior ERCP.
Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation within the right lobe.
However, it is noted that patient does not have an elevated white blood cell count or profound LFT abnormalities.
Edema of the gallbladder wall could be related to third spacing of fluid, particularly given the pleural effusion.
CXR [**2132-9-19**]: No free air.
CT head w/o contrast [**2132-9-20**]: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures, or hydrocephalus.
The density values of the brain show periventricular white matter hypodensity consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
There is prominence of the sulci and ventricles consistent with age-related involutional change.
The basilar artery is slightly dense and more prominent than typically seen.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage.
Possible dense basilar artery, which may represent basilar artery thrombosis.
An MRI/MRA is recommended for further evaluation of this patient's mental status changes.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is sclerosis of the margins of the left sphenoid sinus with a small air fluid level.
There are some high density contents within this fluid.
These findings are consistent with chronic sphenoid sinusitis with inspissated secretions.
CT SCAN OF THE BRAIN WITH CT ANGIOGRAPHY FINDINGS: The noncontrast head CT scan shows no new intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
There is redemonstration of biparietal bony thinning, a congenital finding, as well as generalized brain atrophy.
However, visualized is a 3 x 7 mm partially calcified aneurysm arising from the origin of the supraclinoid portion of the left internal carotid artery, and projecting medially towards the sella turcica.
A much smaller aneurysm (2 mm) is seen arising from the lateral aspect of the same left internal carotid artery segment.
A questionable punctate aneurysm arises off the superior margin of the origin of the left middle cerebral artery.
No other vascular abnormalities are detected.
Multiple left internal carotid and middle cerebral artery aneurysms seen.
ADDENDUM: All studies show what appears to be an irregularly sclerotic appearance of the greater and lesser sphenoid wings in addition to the previously noted sclerosis involving the margins of the sphenoid sinus.
Left upper extremity ultrasound: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] were performed of the left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins.
There is no evidence of left upper extremity deep venous thrombosis.
Again seen in the left supraclavicular region, appearing to arise from the region of the thyroid is a 2.6 x 3.6 x 2.9 cm heterogeneous mass, which continues to demonstrate mass effect upon the left subclavian vessels.
No evidence of left upper extremity DVT.
Continued evidence of left supraclavicular mass, appearing to arise from the left lobe of the thyroid, demonstrating mass effect on the left subclavian vessels, which remain patent with Doppler flow.
Brief Hospital Course: 89 year-old female with multiple medical problems including metastatic breast cancer and history of gallstones and diverticulitis, presenting with RUQ abdominal pain x 2-3 days, found to have elevated alkaline phosphatase with dilated common bile duct and urinary tract infection.
Ascending cholangitis complicated by E coli septicemia: Patient s/p ERCP ([**9-21**]) with removal of sludge/gallstones.
She initially required ICU management with pressors and broad spectrum antibiotics, but has been hemodynamically stable since transfer to the floor [**2132-9-23**].
Blood cultures grew E coli sensitive to zosyn.
Mild persistent tenderness to palpation but much improved.
E. Coli Urinary tract infection.
No evidence of DIC (FDP 0-10, fibrinogen 557, normal coags).
# Altered mental status/dementia: Onset s/p ERCP.
Sodium corrected with free water.
Head CT with question of basilar artery occlusion but follow-up CTA head not supportive.
# Left upper extremity swelling: U/S negative for DVT.
Low reticulocyte count likely due to comorbidities (metastatic breast cancer).
# Metastatic breast cancer:  Patient will need to follow-up as an outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19**] to receive her faslodex injection.
# Thyroid mass: Seen on prior ultrasound/CT.
History of thyroid radiation.
Can be discussed further as an outpatient with her PCP after resolution of cholangitis.
# Access: left midline in place .
