Possible left atrial abnormality.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2107-8-6**] no interim diagnostic change.
No free air.
New areas of mucoid impaction/aspiration in the right lower lobe with resolution of several other previously noted areas.
Area of hypodensity within the left lobe of the liver is not as well evident.
Significant retention of oral contrast within a dilated esophagus and the gastric remnant which may relate to holdup at the anastomotic site/slow transit.
No evidence of obstruction with oral contrast demonstrated within distal loops of small bowel past the jejunostomy site.
Colonic diverticulosis.
Apparent mild interval increase in size of the common bile duct now measuring up to 11mm.
New subcutaneous nodule in the mid uper abdomen may relate to small postoperative seroma.
[**2107-9-30**] EKG Moderate baseline artifact.
Sinus tachycardia.
Slight non-specific ST segment changes.
Short P-R interval.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2107-9-26**], except for increase in rate, no diagnostic interval change.
[**2107-9-30**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for acute aspiration or evolving aspiration pneumonia.
The right lower lobe has a plate-like appearance, and it may be secondary to either volume loss or small infiltrate on the left.
It has more linear appearance and most likely represents volume loss.
[**2107-10-4**] Barium Swallow/Small Bowel Follow Through: IMPRESSION: No emptying of barium from stomach after 85 minutes likely represents obstruction at the gastrojejunal anastamosis.
Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the West 3 surgery service on [**2107-9-26**] for nausea and vomiting.
Neuro: Patient reported severe pain that has been constant ever since surgery at her J-tube site.
Higher doses of narcotic pain medication did not seem to help her pain dramatically.
CV: The patient had one episode of SBP in the 80's the day that her sats dropped, presumptively due to aspiration.
The ICU team gave her several small fluid boluses which promptly increased her SBP nicely.
She was not complaining of dyspnea or SOB.
She was placed on 6 L nasal canula with resolution of her saturation to the low 90's.
Cxr was consistent with aspiration or evolving aspiration PNA.
ABG showed she was not acidotic or hypercarbic but  her PO2 was 54.
During her ICU stay she initially had some SBP in the 80's which responded nicely to fluid boluses.
The AB's were stopped in the ICU as this was thought to be caused by an aspiration pneumonitis rather than an aspiration pneumonia and she was improving nicely.
CT scan showed possible holdup at the anastomotic site/slow transit without any evidence of obstruction.
GI was consulted who took the patient for EGD which showed some edema around the tube site but no obvious cause for her N/V.
Because of her persistent vomiting GI was reconsulted.
The etiology of this lack of emptying is likely due to edema of the gastrojejunal anastamosis, and it is thought that this will resolve with time.
ID: The patient's temperature was closely watched for signs of infection.
Other than the aforementioned aspiration pneumonitis event the patient was afebrile without elevated white count.
At the time of discharge on HD 9, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating tube feeds, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was adequately controlled.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 32277**],  You were admitted to the West 3 General surgery service for nausea and vomiting.
While you were here you were seen by the gastroenterologists who performed an upper GI endoscopic exam.
This did not show any definitive cause for your nausea and vomiting.
Additionally they recommended some further imaging which showed that your nausea and vomiting are likely due to inappropriate emptying of the stomach.
[**Known lastname 17779**] Care: *Please call your surgeon or go to the emergency department if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the [**Known lastname **] site.
*You may shower and wash incisions with a mild soap and warm water.
