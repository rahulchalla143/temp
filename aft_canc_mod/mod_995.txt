Admission Date:  [**2165-4-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2165-5-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2087-9-28**]     Sex:  M  Service:  O-Medicine  CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77 year old male with a stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer and asthma, who was requiring two liters of nasal cannula at home times one year, but started complaining of dyspnea and began to have an increased oxygen requirement, four liters.
Chest pressure is without any radiation or associated nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis.
The patient also has had a cough times one year with clear phlegm production.
The patient has had diarrhea times one week without evidence of any blood.
His shortness of breath was better with standing but worse with activity, like walking or taking a few steps.
He denies any fevers, chills, sweats, abdominal pain, dysuria, or tuberculosis exposure.
A chest x-ray was done which showed a left pneumothorax.
Status post left nephrectomy and partial bladder removal for renal cell cancer 50 years ago.
Stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2160**], bilateral disease without extra-thoracic disease.
Chest:  Decreased breath sounds, increased tympany on left side.
Extremities:  2+ pitting edema in lower extremities bilaterally.
RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Chest x-ray:  Large left sided pneumothorax with minimal right tracheal shift.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 77 year old African-American male with stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer, who presents with acute dyspnea secondary to left pneumothorax.
Several days later, the patient was still noted to have an air leak even though his chest x-ray showed signs of improvement in terms of his pneumothorax.
However, on the night prior to the procedure, [**2165-4-30**], the patient was noticed to have an increased oxygen requirement and noted to be acutely short of breath with use of accessory muscles.
The patient was initially thought to be having a congestive heart failure exacerbation and was given Lasix.
With this episode, the patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
The patient was noted to have left lower lobe and lingular infiltrates and there was some concern for aspiration pneumonia.
There was also concern that the patient was having increased secretions and mucus plugging, for which he received regular standing chest physical therapy.
The patient's diagnosis of asthma is somewhat unclear and he may, in fact, have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
It is possible that some of the patient's bronchospasm in response to nebulizers may be secondary to lymphangitic spread of his cancer.
On [**2165-5-2**], the patient was still noted to have an air leak.
Renal:  The patient was noted to have an increase in his creatinine up 1.4.
This was thought to be secondary to receiving Lasix for what was thought to be an exacerbation of congestive heart failure where, in fact, the patient was probably actually dry, with a metabolic contraction alkalosis.
Hypoxia, likely secondary to mucus plugging, pneumonia, bronchospasm.
