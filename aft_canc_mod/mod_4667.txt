No evidence for pulmonary embolus or acute aortic syndrome.
There is dependent and lingular atelectasis, without focal consolidation suspicious for pneumonia.
Splenomegaly, without evidence for splenic infarct or perisplenic hematoma.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2133-9-22**] 8:37 PM IMPRESSION:  As compared to the previous examination of [**2133-9-14**], small areas of atelectasis in the lung bases have partially resolved.
No newly appeared parenchymal opacities, notably no evidence of pneumonia or other infection.
Unchanged small hiatal hernia.
No pleural effusions, no pericardial effusions.
No evidence of infectious process or lymphadenopathy in the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2133-9-15**] at 2:44:28 PM Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Dilated ascending aorta.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2133-10-7**] at 12:59:15 PM The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Right ventricular function cannot be assessed due to limited image quality.
Left ventricular function difficult to assess due to poor images and rapid heart rate, but is probably low-normal to normal.
Brief Hospital Course: 72-year-old woman with history of breast cancer who presents with a new diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Patient was subsequently started on IVF, bowel regimen, allopurinol, and pain management.
ICU Course: Patient was transferred to ICU for hypoxia, hypotension, and oliguria on [**2133-10-7**].
Initially received 1L fluid bolus for hypotension and oliguria.
Her symptoms were multifactorial with likely underlying infection in the setting of neutropenia, pulmonary edema in the setting of AF with [**Year (4 digits) 5509**] and poor forward flow, and [**Last Name (un) **] from decreased renal perfusion (pre-renal based on urine studies/lytes and negative renal US).
PE was part of the differential diagnosis for her symptoms, but no CTA was done give [**Last Name (un) **].
Her proBNP was found to be elevated and exam showed peripheral edema, suggesting CHF exacerbation in the setting of recent AF with [**Last Name (LF) 5509**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was given lasix 10 mg and 40 mg while in the ICU.
While in the ICU, she also had voriconazole switched back to micafungin given transaminitis possibly [**1-13**] drug toxicity and metronidazole was discontinued [**1-13**] metallic taste in the mouth.
Crt remained elevated while in the ICU but uop remained > 20 cc/hr on average.
With improved symptoms with the above mentioned management, patient was transferred back to the floor.
#ALL: On arrival, the patient had a CXR that showed no intrathroacic pathology, a splenic ultrasound that showed a mildly enlarged spleen with no intrasplenic abnormalities, an ECHO that showed an EF of 55%; the patient subsequently udnerwent a procedure for central line placement.
# Febrile neutropenia: Patient was placed on IV Vanco and Cefepime.
She remained afebrile for a week, and then began spiking to 101.
# Hypotension: On [**10-5**] she was hypotensive in the morning and was found to have blood pressures in the 90's systolic.
She had developed a new oxygen requirement and worsening renal failure, so a CTA was not able to be completed.
# Hypoxia: She developed a new oxygen requirement on [**10-7**] going from 93% on room air to 91% on 5 liters.
Coupled with her hypotension and tachycardia, there was concern for sepsis vs. MI vs. PE.
She was unable to get a chest CTA because of worsening creatinine to 1.9.
She was transferred to the unit for further management, and an echo showed massive dilation of the right atrium, in an otherwise difficult to asses echo.
Her BNP was checked and it was >10K suggesting new heart failure.
# Tachycardia: On the night of [**10-6**] she became tachycardic to 110-130, irregular, and was found to be in a-fib, which was a new diagnosis for her.
She was initially was treated with a fluid bolus of a liter for dehydration and hypotension.
There was concern for PE vs. sepsis vs. heart failure.
She responded initially to fluid, but then continued to be hypotensive with new oxygen requirement.
Her dilated right atrium on echo is a likely source of the a-fib.
# Transaminitis: She completed her course of aspariginase, and subsequently her LFT's increased and were continuing to do so on transfer to the MICU on [**10-7**].
Her transaminitis was likely due to medications, however a RUQ was ordered and showed no cholelithiasis, but fatty infiltrated liver, unable to exclude fibrotic disease.
# Acute renal failure: Her creatinine began to climb starting on [**2133-10-5**] and was 3.7 the last lab check.
It was likely a combination of poor forward flow and medications that led to her renal failure.
She no longer wished to undergo testing, and did not want to take medications any longer aside from pain control.
Medications on Admission: anastrozole 1 mg daily atenolol 25 mg daily   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Season  Hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: ALL acute renal failure from ATN pancytopenia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
