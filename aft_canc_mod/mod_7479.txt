- Right hepatic artery reconstruction using right gonadal vein interposition graft (performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]).
She first noticed the onset of symptoms in [**Month (only) **] or [**Month (only) 1096**] and then was alerted by a friend to her increasing jaundice, which prompted medical evaluation.
She underwent an ultrasound and a CT with contrast and was found to have a 2.4 x 1.8 cm mass with a cystic structre in the head of the pancreas, distended and thickened gallbladder, intrahepatic (1.9 cm)and pancreatic duct (1.2 cm).
At the time of consultation she was clinically well and denies nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits.
There was severe post-obstructive dilation.
A limited pancreatogram revealed a stricture of the main duct at the head.
Cytology samples were obtained for histology which returned positive for adenocarcinoma.
From her OSH scan report, she had no involvement of the mesenteric vessels and no evidence of metastatic disease, although there is periportal lymphadenopathy.
[**Name (NI) 4084**] [**Name2 (NI) 1818**], drank [**2-17**] glasses of wine per night until symptoms started in [**Month (only) **]/[**Month (only) **], no drug use.
Family History: Sister died from leukemia at age 65, mother died of cervical cancer.
No history of benign or malignant pancreatic disease.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2108-4-12**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
HAFNIA ALVEI.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Any growth of P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta       hemolytic streptococci will be reported.
IF THESE BACTERIA ARE NOT       REPORTED BELOW, THEY ARE NOT PRESENT in this culture..       Work-up of organism(s) listed below discontinued (excepted screened       organisms) due to the presence of mixed bacterial flora detected       after further incubation.
| AMPICILLIN------------  =>32 R PENICILLIN G----------  =>64 R VANCOMYCIN------------ <=0.5 S     ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2108-5-5**]):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2108-5-2**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO MYCOBACTERIA ISOLATED.
>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.. .
[**2108-4-12**]: IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive deep vein thrombosis seen within one of the two left brachial veins .
Status post Whipple with serpiginous hypodensity seen in the left lobe most consistent with retraction injury.
No drainable collection.
No radiologically evident cause of leukocytosis is observed.
Extensive anasarca, likely secondary to volume overload.
EXTENT OF INVASION  Primary Tumor:  pT3:  Tumor extends beyond the pancreas but without involvement of the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery.
Margins:     Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma:         Distance from closest margin:  1 mm from peri-uncinate-process adipose tissue margin.
In brief: she required frequent blood transfusions of pRBCs, FFP, and albumin, with a persistent pressor requirement; she developed acute renal failure requiring CVVH, had persistent elevations of LFTs, had a persistent leukocytosis and in total the cardiology, infectious disease, renal, and hepatology services were consulted.
Significant events by post-operative day included: On POD2 the renal service was consulted given persistent renal failure postoperatively, and she was begun on CVVH.
Antibiotics were thereafter tailored appropriately in consultation with the infectious disease service.
Lactulose was initiated given poor mental status (AOx1 initially), on which she seemed to initially improve.
Her pressor requirement remained persistent, and her WBC continued to trend upwards.
