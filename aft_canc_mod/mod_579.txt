Admission Date:  [**2170-1-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2170-2-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2111-9-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy, Y stent Placement  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 58 yo F with history of HIV (Last CD4 186 on [**11-30**]) and recently diagnosed metastatic small cell lung cancer, presenting with worsening shortness of breath x 5 days.
On admission to the hospital, the patient reported she has had worsening shortness of breath over the prior 5 days to the point where she is unable to climb stairs and lie flat.
Denied fevers or chills.
She was started on prednisone for these symptoms by her primary doctor in the week prior to admission.
She reports + pleuritic pain in right chest when coughing.
Denied other chest pain, abdominal pain, urinary complaints, bowel changes, or lower extremity pain/swelling.
Original symptoms improved with 2 combivnet nebs.
However, the study showed new mediastinal lymphadenopathy causing lingular and left upper lobe collapse as well as a destructive lesion centered in the right third rib with invasion into the adjacent anterior chest wall and pulmonary parenchyma.
She was initially admitted to OMED but immediately triggered twice for respiratory distress and was transferred to the ICU.
There, she underwent flexible bronchoscopy which showed that the right upper lobe was completely occluded with tumor, and also revealed tumor in the left mid main-stem bronchus with bronchomalacia of the left mainstem that resulted in complete occlusion of the airway on exhalation.
Endobronchial tumor was debrided with APC and a Y-stent was deployed successfully.
During her ICU course she was started on levo/flagyl for empiric treatment of post-obstructive PNA, but given her lack of fevers/WBC/cough, these were d/c'ed on antibiotic day #4.
She was transferred back to the OMED service on [**2170-1-27**] for possible palliative chemo/XRT.
At that point her SOB and associated chest pain had entirely resolved, and that she is in no pain.
She improved with suction; however, a portable chest x-ray showed severe atelectasis of the right upper lobe as well as continued near white-out of the left side, now with even fewer visible lung markings and a more obscured hemidiaphragm.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for observation and closer monitoring and nursing care.

Mother: s/p pacer, lymphoma  Physical Exam: Vitals - HR 89 BP 127/75 RR 26 O2 89% on cool neb oxygen (79-80 on 2.5L when triggered by RN on onc floor) General - SOB, labored breathing, using accessory muscles of respiration, not able to use voice, mouthing sentences Neck - + anterior cervical lymphadenopathy CV - distant heart sounds, no appreciable murmur Lungs - extremely loud low-pitched ronchi, unclear air movement through most of lung fields (i.e., most sounds are projected upper airway sounds), some air movement at lower right) Abdomen - soft, NT/ND, BS+  Pertinent Results: Imaging: [**2170-1-23**] CXR - Opacity involving the entire left lobe of the lung is concerning for left lobe destruction.
No pulmonary embolus.
Marked increased size of confluent mediastinal lymphadenopathy causing lingular collapse as well as left upper lobe collapse.
Marked increased size of destructive lesion within the lateral right third rib.
[**2170-1-29**] CXR - verbal report only: significant atelectasis/collapse of RUL; worsening of opacity and more obscure hemidiaphragm on left.
Micro: [**2169-1-23**] Blood - pending   Brief Hospital Course: 58 yo F with HIV, small cell lung cancer, and HTN admitted with SOB.
Found to have left upper/lingular lung collaspe.
# SOB - She was initially admitted to OMED but immediately triggered twice for respiratory distress and was transferred to the ICU.
There, she underwent flexible bronchoscopy which showed that the right upper lobe was completely occluded with tumor, and also revealed tumor in the left mid main-stem bronchus with bronchomalacia of the left mainstem that resulted in complete occlusion of the airway on exhalation.
Endobronchial tumor was debrided with APC and a Y-stent was deployed successfully.

At that point her SOB and associated chest pain had entirely resolved, and that she was in no pain.
She improved with suction; however, a portable chest x-ray showed severe atelectasis of the right upper lobe as well as continued near white-out of the left side, now with even fewer visible lung markings and a more obscured hemidiaphragm.
On the floor she required interventional pulmonary to perform one additional bronch on [**2-9**], where additional tumor and mucus were removed.
She did not plug again but remained with a small of requirement and a junky exam.
Her steroids were tapered as she briefly experienced some hallucinations thought to be a side effect.
# Small Cell Lung Cancer - The patients small cell lung cancer has returned after an initial response to chemotherpy in [**Month (only) **].
She had a Y stent placed (see above) for tumor obstruction of her left and right bronchus.

You needed our lung doctors to [**Name5 (PTitle) **] a stent in your trachea to keep it open, as your cancer had invaded into the lung and caused blockage of a large portion of your airway.
You also had 1 dose of palliative chemotherapy, and 5 sessions of palliative radition, to try to alleviate your symptoms.
While here you also developed an infection of your stool which causes diarrhea.
If you experience any symptoms which concern you, please call the on [**Name8 (MD) 138**] RN, your doctor, or go to the ED.
