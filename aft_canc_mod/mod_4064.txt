# Dyspnea:  Dyspnea was felt to be due to patient's ill-fitting trach given her extensive tracheomalacia.
Her course was also complicated by volume overload, and she has a history of CHF.
We attempted to diurese her on the day of admission; however, that night she became acutely dyspneic and desaturated.
It was further advanced, and she had no additional problems with the trach or desaturation.
She had completed treatment for pneumonia while at [**Hospital 8**] Hospital.
Diuresis failed on the first night but was successful on the second day of admission.
She is not on a beta-blocker or ACE inhibitor.
CHF management is also complicated by history of critical aortic stenosis.
