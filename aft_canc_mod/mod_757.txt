Admission Date:  [**2119-5-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-5-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2058-9-30**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Seizures  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
R craniotomy   History of Present Illness: This is a 60 year old woman with classic migraines, breast cancer with metastasis including to the right frontal brain, s/p resection, currently on Doxorubicin for chemotherapy presenting with increased seizures.
The patient reports that, similar to her prior seizure episodes, she developed left gaze preference, left facial droop, expressive aphasia, and tonic clonic movements beginning at 10pm, which woke her from sleep and lasted about 5-15 minutes each.
Per OSH records, the patient was sitting in a chair and developed slurred speech and mild L facial droop, but was conscious throughout the seizure and had normal strength in her extremities.
Her symptoms were reported to resolve over 10 minutes.
She reportedly developed increased seizure frequency 1 month ago when her anti-seizure medications were decreased.
OSH records also note that the patient developed a seizure after transfer to the hospital bed.
A CT head was performed at [**Hospital1 1562**] which showed right encephalomalacia, and volume loss, no midline shift or ICH.
The patient denies recent fevers, productive cough, acute vision changes (but does report her vision has been blurry/slightly doubled without frank diplopia since her neurosurgical procedure), abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, rash, focal numbness/tingling/weakness.
She does report increased urinary frequency and increased urgency as well as foul smelling urine, which she states are her typical symptoms for a UTI.
Past Medical History: - Metastatic breast cancer (1) a right frontal craniotomy for resection of the metastasis by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 548**], M.D.
on [**2117-12-23**] (2) Cyberknife radiosurgery to the 1-right frontal lobe resection cavity to 2400 cGy (800 cGy x 3 fractions) at 84% isodose line from [**2118-1-26**] to [**2118-1-28**] (3) lumbar puncture on [**2118-6-23**] showed 0 WBC, 31 protein, and negative cytology for malignant cells (4) status post Cyberknife radiosurgery on [**2118-7-6**] at 2-right frontal metastasis to [**2108**] cGy at 70% isodose line and 3-left frontal metastasis to 2200 cGy at 77% isodose line.
She reports some evidence of word-finding difficulty intermittently, particuarly when she is fatigued.
Her oncological problem began in [**2105**] when she palpated a mass in the left breast.
A mammogram showed suspicious breast tumor.
The pathology showed ER positive infiltrating ductal carcinoma.
She was well until [**2112**] when she developed a cough and a chest X-ray showed a shadow.
A work up at another institution revealed metastatic breast cancer  to her subcarinal lymph node.
Her neurological problem began in later [**Name (NI) **] and early [**2117-12-7**], with pounding [**Hospital1 **]-frontal headaches that radiated to the occiput.
She did not have night-time headache.
She also had positional nausea and imbalance, but no vomiting.
A gadolinium-enhanced head MRI on [**2117-12-21**] showed a right frontal enhancing mass with surrounding cerebral edema, mass effect, and 2 mm of midline shift.
The pathology was ER positive metastatic breast carcinoma.
She then had another session of Cyberknife radiosurgery on [**2118-7-6**] at 2-right frontal metastasis to [**2108**] cGy at 70% isodose line and 3-left frontal metastasis to 2200 cGy at 77% isodose line.
Other Past Medical History: - Diabetes - h/o seizures    Social History: married, two grown children in the area.
Family History: Grandmother died of stomach cancer at age 76.
Father- stroke and coronary artery disease.
Skin: No rashes or bruising Neuro: CNs II-XII intact; left facial droop on observation but symmetric grossly when examined individually.
Pertinent Results: STUDIES: MR SPECTROSCOPY [**2119-5-15**]: Interval progression in the pattern of enhancement at the right temporal frontoparietal lesion with avid perfusion and increased signal on the corresponding ASL sequence, concerning for tumor progression, there is also mild increase in vasogenic edema extending at the external capsule as described above.
No other lesions are identified.
[**2119-5-19**] MRI brain There are stable post-surgical changes at the right frontoparietal region, the anterior right frontal lesion again measures 12 x 17 mm and the second right posterior frontal lesion is also stable in size and involves the adjacent dura.
There is surrounding low signal intensity which is stable and most suggestive of vasogenic edema.
There are no new brain lesions identified.
IMPRESSION: Stable brain metastasis with no evidence of new lesions.
CT head [**2119-5-19**] Expected postoperative changes following right frontal craniotomy for right frontal and parietal lesions  MRI brain [**2119-5-20**] Postoperative changes are seen in the right side of the scalp.
There is also a small postoperative extra-axial collection.
No large territorial infarction in the operative bed.
There is a possible small focus of infarction in the right posterolateral frontal lobe, although this conceivably could be artifact from blood products.
Leptomeningeal enhancement in the right frontal lobe is likely to be post-surgical, and there is mild midline shift to the left for a few millimeters which is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Post-operative changes with probable residual neoplasm as detailed above.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 60 year old woman with classic migraines, breast cancer with metastasis including to the right frontal brain, s/p resection, currently on Doxorubicin for chemotherapy presenting with increased seizures.
They felt that the patient's symptoms are consistent with her known seizure disorder, likely secondary to brain mets.
She underwent MR Spectroscopy on [**5-15**] which showed "Interval progression in the pattern of enhancement at the right temporal frontoparietal lesion with avid perfusion and increased signal on the corresponding ASL sequence, concerning for tumor progression, there is also mild increase in vasogenic edema extending at the external capsule".
A functional MRI was obtained preoperatively which showed no motor involvement of right frontal tumor.
She was transferred to SICU for further management and frequent neuro checks.
A CT and subsequent MRI demonstrated no acute hemorrhage.
6. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every twenty-four(24) hours as needed for anxiety : LORAZEPAM - 0.5 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth as needed as needed for anxiety.
Outpatient Physical Therapy   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: -Breast cancer with brain metastases -Seizure disorder   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
We increased your Keppra dose to 1000mg three times a day and you remained seizure-free while in the hospital.
You went for an MRI to address your brain metastases which suggested possible tumor progression.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
?Please return to the office in [**7-16**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your sutures if necessary and a wound check.
