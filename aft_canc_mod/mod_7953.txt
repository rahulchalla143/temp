================= IMAGING: ================= CTA HEAD ([**2132-7-6**]): WET READ: Extensive bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage as on prior from OSH.
No evidence of intracranial aneurysm with patent major vessels.
CHEST PA&LAT ([**2132-7-6**]):FINDINGS: Elevated left hemidiaphragm is noted.
Cardiomegaly is noted; however, this could be reflective of low lung volumes.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen.
CT HEAD ([**2132-7-7**]): SAH grossly unchanged with small amount of hemorrhage in occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of right lateral ventricle, likely redistribution of blood.
No shift of midline structures or central herniation .
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion (mainly posterior).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CT head ([**7-13**]): Interval mild decrease in bilateral subdural and subarachnoid and prenchymal hemorrhages.
No new areas of hemorrhage.
lucent lesion in the left parietal bone- attention on followup.
# Febrile Neutropenia, Bacteremia, CLL He was reportedly febrile for several days prior to his presentation, and was febrile to 102.7 on arrival in the ICU.
Given the presence of a murmur on exam and bacteremia, patient underwent TTE, which revealed no vegetations.
He has a hx of temporal lobe seizures and seized on [**7-13**].
Because penicillin is thought to be more eliptogenic than ampicillin, he was swtiched bact to ampicillin q4h with the intention of treating for a total course of 4 weeks starting the day his neutropenia resolved ([**Date range (1) 91546**]).
Oncology was consulted regarding management of CLL and neutropenia.
Neupogen was started on [**7-9**], his counts rose and on [**7-13**] he was no longer neutropenic.
# Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: He developed an extensive SAH and SDH after fall from his bed at home with headstrike.
CTA brain did not show evidence of an aneurysm.
Three repeat head CTs showed a grossly unchanged SAH with no shift of midline structures or central herniation.
# Seizure disorder: continued felbamate.
# Urinary retention: Had somewhat high post-void residuals.
# Delirium: After the bulk of the medical issues above stabilized, the patient became delirious on [**7-13**] and [**7-14**], this largely resolved 48 hours prior to discharge.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] at [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Febrile neutropenia Bacteremia, Listeria CLL Subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhages Urinary retention Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent, difficulty communicating because of non-compliance with hearing aide.
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 41671**],  You were admitted after a fall in which caused bleeding in and around your brain (subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage).
The size of the bleeding remained stable, and the Neurosurgery service felt that no intervention was needed.
You were found to have a bloodstream infection (with the bacteria Listeria) while your white blood cell count was low.
You were treated with antibiotics, and should continue antibiotics for a total of 4 weeks.
You became confused while you were in the hospital, but this cleared spontaneously prior to discharge.
