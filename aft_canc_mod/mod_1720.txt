Denies sick contacts or recent travel.
In the ED his O2 sat was found to be 78% on RA, CTA negative for PE, CXR revealed Bilateral basilar opacities and right pleural effusion.
He was noted to be in Aflutter with Lateral ST depressions and inverted T waves on ECG.
Past Medical History: - inoperable pancreatic cancer diagnosed [**6-16**] s/p ERCP with stent placement, laporatomy with attempted Whipple, on gemcitabine (received 3 weekly treatments starting [**2139-9-22**], followed by a week off, then a fourth dose yesterday [**2143-10-20**]) - h/o SBO - h/o cholangitis ([**6-16**]) with Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, and Strep Viridans - h/o bacteremia with Enterococcus fecalis (Vanc sensitive) and Pseudomonas (sensitive to Zosyn) - s/p choecystectomy tube (fell out [**7-17**]) - Hypertension - ankylosing spondylitis - right kidney cystic lesion - Moderate Aortic stenosis - intermittent SVT - anemia - tinea corporis .
He has not been married and has no children.
He denies past or present tobacco, alcohol, or other drug use.
FH:  His sister had pancreatic cancer and is status post a Whipple procedure.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
New bilateral pleural effusions.
New low-density low attenuating fluid seen surrounding the ascending aorta with no evidence of aortic contour abnormality, dissection, or aneurysm.
Interval resolution of intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Presence of intraductal air is most consistent with patient's interval stent replacement.
Large right renal cyst, with rim calcifications.
Bilateral basilar opacities, worrisome for aspiration.
Right pleural effusion.
Mild congestive heart failure.
Moderate aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**12-14**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No pericardial effusion.
A/P: 70 yo M with inoperable pancreatic cancer s/p ERCP with stent placement, laparotomy with attempted Whipple, h/o cholangitis, on gemcitabine (received first dose of 2nd round yesterday) who presents with fever to 105 and shortness of breath.
Likely secondary to PNA seen on CXR however need to consider biliary source given pancreatic cancer with previous biliary obstruction requiring stent placement.
Need to monitor closely for sepsis given tachycardia, tachypnea, and fever.
- s/p 3 liters NS with good BP, will hold off on additional fluid hydration given mild CHF and pleural effusions seen on CXR  - will obtain CT abd with oral contrast to evaluate for evidence of infection; may need ERCP to evaluate biliary stent placement - will start Vanco and Zosyn (previous culture data from cholangitis revealed Enterococcus and Pseudomonas sensitive to vanco and zosyn) - control fever with tylenol - monitor blood and urine culture .
Etiology likely PNA and pleural effusions.
Need to control HR to prevent worsening pulmonary congestion.
#  Aflutter with rapid rate.
h/o intermittent SVT.
#  Elevated Trop of 0.
[**Street Address(2) 28437**] depressions and TWI's likely secondary to demand ischemia in setting of rapid aflutter and hypoxia.
- continue to cycle cardiac enzymes - monitor on tele - will d/c heparin gtt as likely demand ischemia - continue ASA .
