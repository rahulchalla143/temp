She reports that she has epistaxis frequently, but that it was much worse than usual, (dripping blood, used 3 boxes of kleenex, passing several clots).
Oral ulcers/inflammation of her lips has been present x 2 weeks; it is uncler if this is due to HSV vs a side effect of chemo.
Past Medical History: Non small cell lung CA of LUL -left superior anterior mediastinum  diagnosed in [**11-29**] as part of w/u for worsening sob- Well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of mucinous type, stains consistent with primary lung carcinoma.
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in thoracic surgery felt that the mass was not operable to the the location adjacent to the branch vessels of the aorta - s/p 2 cycles of carboplatin and Taxol, complicated by an episode of acute shortness of breath, nausea, myaglgias and significant neuropathy; s/p 1 cycle of carboplatin AUC 6 and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 days one and eight, complicated by epistaxis, thrombocytopenia.
Coronary artery bypass graft x2 vessels [**2164**] Aortic valve replacement in [**4-/2165**], a tissue valve Chronic back pain with sciatica Diastolic CHF requiring hosp x 2 ([**2164**], [**2166**]); recent echo showed LVEF of 75%, LVOT Obstruction Hypertension results in pulmonary edema Hypotension results in syncope History of right-sided pulmonary nodules Cholecystectomy TAH and BSO (unclear why) Cataract surgery Thyroid cancer ([**2112**], radical surgery and radiation therapy)   Social History:  She is married.
Family History: Her mother died at age 83 of senile dementia and CHF.
She has a brother age 73 in good health with the exception of diabetes and sister age 77 and a sister age 69.
She has two maternal aunts with breast cancer in her early 60s but, otherwise, there is no family history of cancer.
Physical Exam: Vitals- T 98.6 BP 91/52 HR 90 RR 22 O2Sat 91% RA Gen: Comfortable, NAD Heent: + oral ulcer on lip.
scattered exp wheezes.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia Possible left atrial abnormality Late R wave progression - probable normal variant Since pervious tracing, heart rate faster .
Bibasilar opacities are concerning for consolidation or atelectasis.
Left hemidiaphragm elevation and left pleural effusion are unchanged.
Left superior mediastinal mass has increased in size which may be due to tumor extension, atelectasis surrounding the tumor, or post-obstructive consolidation.
[**2-12**] TTE The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a severe resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate to severe mitral annular calcification.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**11-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 female with NSCLC admitted for febrile neutropenia, transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for 24 hours with sudden respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema, then transferred back to OMED where her course was complicated by pneumonia and recurrent pulmonary edema due to diastolic failure.
When patient arrived to the floor on admission she was initially stable, breathing comfortably with a lung exam notable for only decreased sounds in the LLL.
However, shortly after arrival, she developed acute respiratory distress with tachypnea and shortness of breath.
Her lung exam revealed diffuse crackles and rales.
CXR showed cephalization and some consolidation at the left hemidiaphragm.
In the ICU patient was still very tachypneic and in respirtory distress so given 4mg of morphine.
She again had respiratory distress secondary to pulmonary edema triggered by HTN and tachycardia on [**2-10**]; this event was managed on the floor with Lasix and Lopressor IV.
#Pulmonary edema/Diastolic Dysfunction: The patient's respiratory failure was thought to be due to sudden pulmonary edema due to tachycardia and hypertension in the setting of severe diastolic heart failure and LVOT obstruction.
She will follow up with cardiology after discharge for further management of her severe diastolic disfunction and consideration of AV nodal ablation.
# Febrile Neutropenia - Mrs[**Known lastname 19892**] counts quickly improved as she had received Neulasta prior to her hospitalization.
She remained afebrile throughout her admission.
#Aspiration Risk: The patient has known L vocal cord paralysis and had witnessed aspiration events on two occasions.
She stated full understanding of her ongoing aspiration and of the associated risks of that.
#HSV: The patient had extensive perioral HSV ulcerations on admission.
# Cardiovascular: The patients statin and ASA were discontinued in an effort to minimize her pill burden given her difficulty in swallowing.
# Hypothyroidism -The patient was continued on synthroid.
# Diarrhea - the day prior to discharge the patient had some loose stool.
C diff was negative and she remained afebrile for more than 24 hours with a decrease in her white count.
