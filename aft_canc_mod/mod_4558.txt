He had previoulsy been on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation -- but was subsequently cardioverted and has stopped anticoagulation.
He reports feeling well, with no complaints of dysphagia, cough, or recurrent GI bleeding.
He tolerated this well initially without complication and was transferred to the SICU in stable condition.
In the first few days after the OR he experienced worsening renal failure which required placement of an HD line and starting CVVHD.
Over the next few days he had difficulty with Rapid Afib, requiring aggressive medical mgt with Amiodarone, Diltiazem, and lopressor.
He had hypotension associated with this, also respiratory distress requiring reintubation.
ON POD 10 he underwent EGD because he was becoming clinically much more ill and a CT of his chest demonstrated pericardial and pleural effusion.
EGD demonstrated a frankly necrotic gastric conduit.
He was maintained on a heparin gtt for his Afib and his propensity to clot off the CVVHD lines.
He continued to have multiple episodes of rapid afib with HD instability and required multiple cardioversions over the following days.
His [**Location (un) 5701**] bag was tightened over the next few days and he was eventually taken back to the OR on [**3-28**] for definitive abdominal closure.
Post-op he continued to display septic physiology requiring pressors.
He also had his left pleural effusion and pericardial effusions drained.
He remained on CVVH, and his respiratory cultures grew Klebsiella for which he was treated with multiple antibiotics.
On [**2180-4-16**], the patient's mental status globally declined, and ABG demonstrated a respiratory acidosis.
He underwent a head CT scan on [**2180-4-17**] to evaluate his mental status which was negative for acute intra-cranial process.
On [**2180-4-18**], CT scan of his torso demonstrated a tracheal perforation at the level of the ET tube balloon and a loculated R hydropneumothorax.
His pulmonary status continued to improve, and he remained stable on pressure support ventilation with minimal assistance, and he was tolerating trach collar trials.
