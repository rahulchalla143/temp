HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82-year-old right-handed woman with a history of angina and blocked coronary arteries seen as an outpatient for evaluation of visual problem and a cystic enhancing mass was found on MRI.
Her neurologic problems began approximately one to two weeks prior to the admission when she noted difficulty seeing out of the left side.
He ophthalmologist noted a field cut on the left side and she was sent to have a CT scan of the brain on [**2144-8-4**] and subsequently a gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the brain on [**2144-8-10**], for which a cystic enhancing mass was found on the right occipital brain.
Myocardial infarction.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Pertinent for coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction in her family as well as a brother who had stomach cancer and her mother had complications from a hysterectomy.
ALLERGIC:  The patient is allergic to aspirin and it has made her bleed in the past.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for a skin rash, head, eyes, ears, nose and throat symptoms, other than the history of present illness, neck, cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or musculoskeletal symptoms.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The vital signs were within normal limits with a blood pressure of 190/94 consistent with hypertensive disease, but she was on Atenolol, heart rate 72.
No carotid bruits noted.
The extremities showed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
No right or left confusion or finger agnosia.
Visual field examination showed an incongruous left-sided field cut, worse in the left eye than the right.
The funduscopic examination revealed sharp disk margins bilaterally with spontaneous venous pulsations.
The motor examination showed a drift of the right upper extremity but no pronation.
The deep tendon reflexes were 2+ bilaterally except for absence of bilateral ankle jerks.
Frozen section at the time raised the question of it being a metastatic lesion as opposed to the previous thought of it being a primary brain tumor.
However, on the floor, on [**2144-8-14**] at 9:30 p.m. the patient experienced a syncopal episode.
She got up to go to the bathroom with the help of her daughter and began to feel weak at that time.
Due to the hematocrit of 29.2, a decision was made to transfuse if the hematocrit fell less than 29 and the patient remained stable then until later on [**2144-8-14**], at which time she complained of an episode of chest discomfort which was accompanied by EKG changes in the evening.
She was seen in consultation by the Cardiology Service for this and she was placed on telemetry with cycling of the cardiac enzymes at that time.
Her course was subsequently complicated by some coffee ground emesis and drainage on a NG tube and she was seen by the GI service for an upper GI bleed.
She subsequently underwent endoscopy which identified the source of bleeding on endoscopy.
The patient then was seen in consultation by the Thoracic Surgery Service after a CT scan of the chest and abdomen revealed lung masses as well as an adrenal mass.
This raised the question of a high likelihood of a metastatic lung lesion as the primary source of the brain tumor and arrangements were made for the patient to undergo a fine-needle aspiration and biopsy at a subsequent hospitalization.
