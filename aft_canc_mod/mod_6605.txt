History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) **] is a 47 y/o man with a PMH of GBM s/p resection, radiation, ongoing chemo (with Avastin and carboplatin; last cycle this past tuesday), and seizures who presents after a prolonged seizure this morning.
His wife proceeded to stand him up and walked him by supporting his weight, she says this usually helps break his seizures, but he wouldn't come out of his unresponsive state.
on [**2135-6-22**], (3) received involved-field cranial irradiation with temozolomide to [**2135-7-11**] to [**2135-8-22**], (4) started Nuvigil on [**2135-7-12**] and stopped on [**2135-9-5**], (5) s/p 2 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide at 200 mg/m2/day x 5 days since [**2135-9-24**], (6) s/p 2 cycle of XL-184, which was started on [**2135-11-25**], (7) s/p hospitalization from [**2136-1-20**] to [**2136-1-22**] after a seizure causing non-fluent aphasia, (8) had 3 cycles of bevacizumab (5 mg/kg on [**2136-2-28**] and 10 mg/kg on [**2136-3-13**] in cycle 1, 10 mg/kg in cycle 2, 15 mg/kg in cycle 3, and 12.5 mg/kg in cycle 4), (9) had adverse abdominal reaction (pain and inability to tolerate food) with Etoposide which he last received approximately 10 days ago ([**2136-6-24**]), (10) But after stopping etoposide on [**2136-6-24**], his cramping and nausea improved by [**2136-6-26**].
He was found to be neutropenic on [**2136-6-28**] with WBC at 1.2 and ANC at 467.
He had his colonoscopy on [**2136-6-29**] without problem.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Arthritis GERD Hashimoto's thyroiditis Glaucoma Raynaud's syndrome s/p shoulder surgery Seizures Sigmoid diverticulosis Rectal bleed from hemorrhoids  Social History: He lives at home with wife and denied tobacco, drugs, or alcohol abuse.
His mother died of a left frontal lobe astrocytic tumor.
Physical Exam: Physical Examination At The Time Of Admission: GENERAL:  Awake, alert, NAD [**Date Range 4459**]:  Sclerae anicteric, no conjunctival injection, oropharynx clear CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate, Nl S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops PULMONARY:  CTA bilaterally, no wheezes, rhonchi, rales ABDOMEN:  Positive BS, soft, NTND abdomen EXTREMITIES:  No lower extremity edema bilaterally  NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: Mental status:  Awake and alert, flattened affect.
He had decreased attention, perseverates with saying days of week backwards.
There was no dysarthria, but stuttering speech, plus mild anomia  Cranial Nerves:  Right pupil:  7mm-->5mm, left pupil fixed at 6mm and non-reactive.
Right homonymous hemianopsia.
Mild ptosis of left eyelid with right esotropia.
Mild flattening of right nasolabial fold.
Right pronator drift.
+extinction on double stimulation with touch to left face and right side.
GENERAL:  AAOx3, conversant [**Hospital1 4459**]:  Left pupil enlarged, minimally reactive CARDIOVASCULAR:  RRR, S1+S2, no m/r/g PULMONARY:  CTAB ABDOMEN:  Soft, non-tender, non-distended, with psotive bowel sounds EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema  NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:  His Karnofsky Performance Score is 60.
Extraocular movements are full; there is no nystagmus.
Visual fields are full to confrontation in OD but his OS has no light perception.
Motor Examination:  There is slight pronation of his right hand.
Coordination examination does not reveal appendicular dysmetria.
EEG: IMPRESSION: Very abnormal EEG due to overall voltage reduction with marked interhemispheric asymmetry and exaggerated slowing over the left hemisphere compared to the right with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharging activity from the left posterior quadrant.
While some of the voltage asymmetry may represent a breach rhythm there was, in addition, some excess of slowing and periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges from the left hemisphere indicative of more disruptive rhythms and destructive processes involving L>R hemisphere.
In addition, the overall slowing and voltage reduction would suggest a diffuse encephalopathy more accentuated over the left than the right.
MRI Brain: IMPRESSION: The multifocal foci of lesional enhancement as well as diffuse FLAIR hyperintensity bilaterally has slightly progressed compared with the prior study.
Similar to that described on the prior study, in the setting of Avastin treatment, this is again concerning for continued tumor progression.
Neck Soft Tissue: The current study demonstrates, on the AP view, preserved airway column, but there is slight deviation of the air column to the right with some narrowing and impinging over the left wall.
This might be attributed to slight asymmetric position of the neck, but mass effect cannot be excluded, thus repeated radiograph, or if clinically justified, CT of the neck might be considered.
Lateral view demonstrates no evidence of soft tissue swelling.
Extensive degenerative changes are demonstrated within the cervical spine.
CT Neck: IMPRESSION: No evidence of compression of the airway.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: There is a congenital fusion anomaly with C5- C7 "block" vertebral body with rudimentary intervening disc spaces, as well as ankylosis of the posterior elements, particularly at C5-C6 on the right (as on MR examination of [**2136-10-30**].
There is associated abnormal rotation of these vertebrae, with focal levoscoliosis, and displacement of the laryngeal skeleton and the proximal cervical trachea to the right.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Multifocal lesions consistent with tumor in a patient with known glioblastoma multiforme appear overall stable since the prior.
Hypodensity in the right frontoparietal lobe is more apparent than on reference CT head of [**2136-11-24**] and may represent subacute infarct.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: The hypodense region in right parietovertex subcortical white matter likely corresponds to the vasogenic edema associated with numerous enhancing lesions at this site, well-demonstrated on the interval MR study of [**2136-11-26**], which had progressed since the prior study of [**2136-10-23**].
There is no additional finding to suggest interval infarction.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 22950**] is a 47-year-old man with a past medical history of glioblastoma of left frontal lobe, s/p resection, radiation, ongoing chemotherapy (bevacizumab and irinotecan since [**2136-8-15**], alternating with 1 cycle of bevacizumab and carboplatin since [**2136-9-18**], and in combination with cis-retinoic acid 3 weeks on and 1 week off) and seizures, who presents after a prolonged seizure, s/p intubation at outside hospital with admission to neurosurgery ICU [**2136-11-24**] and transferred to OMED following extubation [**2136-11-27**].
He continued to have occasional seizures with right sided hand an facical twitching which were responsive to ativan.
He also had a NCHCT that was concerning for some worsening of his edema.
He had an MRI that showed slight progression of his lesions from the previous study.
Prior to his discharge had episode of significant fatigue and drowsiness preceeded by some vertigo-like complaints, later developed some lip numbness which resolved with PO liquid Ativan.
CT of his head showed hypodensity in the right frontoparietal lobe which is more apparent than on reference CT head of [**2136-11-24**] and may represent subacute infarct.
(2) Neck Swelling:  Patient developed left sided soft tissue swelling in the neck overnight [**2136-12-1**].
This was not associated with any pain or symptoms.
Neck X-ray showed possible left sided impingement and deviation to the right, which could not differentiate between mass effect versus rotation of the film.
A CT neck was pursued which showed no evidence of compression of the airway, just a benign congenital anomaly.
(7) Constipation:  Patient with signficant constipation without a BM for sevaral days on admission.
(8) Anxiety:  He has intermittently become agitated and confused at night, requiring prn ativan.
However throughout admission he did quite well on standing and PRN Xanax especially in the presence of his family  (9) Hypertension:  He has had some high BPs with diastolics in the 100s, but has otherwise been stable from a cardiovascular standpoint.
20. alprazolam 0.25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for anxiety.
