Admission Date:  [**2198-1-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2198-1-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2127-3-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Iron  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: femoral line intubation/extubation lumbar puncture tracheal stent  History of Present Illness: 70 y/o female with COPD, HTN, alcoholism who presents with worsening stridor now intubated for enlarging mediastinal mass eroding into the trachea.
Pt was recently evaluated [**12-20**] by her PCP for worsening dysphagia and weight loss.
Given her history of tracheostomy and high risk of head and neck malignancy with smoking and EtOH she was referred to ENT.
She was seen by ENT on [**12-25**] who noted true vocal cord paralysis on larygoscopy and planned to have her evaluated with neck and upper chest CT for mass which was perfrormed [**1-4**].
CT scan revealed pulmonary nodules with an esophageal mass(report not available)concerning for metastatic esophageal CA.
She continued to have mild dysphagia but began developing worseing SOB and decreased voice.
On [**1-18**] she presented to [**Hospital3 **] ED and was found to be anxious, tachycardic, and short of breath with stridor with no hypoxia.
CXR revealed upper mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules, so CTA was performed to better characterize them.
CT revealed a new RLL mass, LLL atelactasis, enlarging left infrahilar mass, and enlarging esophageal mass which is now eroding into the trachea.
In the ED she continued to be stridulous and was seen by thoracic surgery who reported that she was not an operative candidate as the mass dissected through multiple planes.
Due to risk of worsening erosion of this mass she was intubated by anesthesia.
Past Medical History: Hypothyroidism Pneumonitis requiring tracheostomy Pna Copd Peptic ulcer disease Irritable bowel Colon polyps Alcoholic pancreatitis Alcoholism HTN Polio Vertebroplasty Right elbow fx Deafness Decreased vision Osteoporosis ?
liver disease with hepatic encephalopathy  Social History: Cont to smoke 1ppd which she has done for 54 years, hx of EtOH withdrawal and heavy abuse in past.
Physical Exam: T 99.0  HR 110    BP 120/75   AC 450/20 peep 5 FIO2 50% Gen-sedated and intubated HEENT-PERRL, no elev JVP, MMM, no ant or post cerv LAD Hrt-tachy RR, nS1S2 no MRG Lungs-CTA bilat Abd-soft, NT, ND, no HSM Extrem-2+rad and dp pulses, no cyanosis or clubbing Neuro-withdrawing to pain, absent reflexes but not compliant with exam Skin-no rashes or lesions  Pertinent Results: Labs and studies- pH 7.34 pCO2 43 pO2 104 HCO3 24 Na:142 K:3.5 Cl:109 TCO2:24 Glu:170 Lactate:2.3 .
CXR-LLL infiltrate, left hilar fullness, multiple pulmonary nodules.
[**2198-1-19**] Chest CT: Diffusely infiltrating soft tissue density mass centered in the esophagus and extending from the cricopharyngeus muscle approximately 10 cm inferiorly.
Evidence of invasion into the posterior trachea, and aorta.
Severe tracheal narrowing to about half the normal luminal caliber.
[**1-20**] UE U/S: Limited study without demonstration of basilic and cephalic veins, however, no evidence of DVT.
[**1-22**] CT head: Probable minor degree of chronic small vessel infarction without other findings to account for the patient's stated unresponsiveness.
[**1-22**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**]: Minor cervical spondylosis with demonstration of presumed esophageal mass causing esophageal obstruction.
No definite evidence for acute brain ischemia.
Within these severe limitations, there is demonstration and confirmation of the suspected small (3-mm) anterior communicating artery aneurysm.
No other definite vascular abnormalities are seen, again allowing for the very limited resolution provided by this study.
[**1-23**] EEG: This was an abnormal routine EEG due to the slow and disorganized background with generalized bursts of slowing as well as generalized suppression.
These findings are consistent with a moderately severe encephalopathy.
There were also bursts of generalized sharps or sharp and slow wave complexes predominantly in the frontocentral  regions, which may be seen with in patients with severe encephalopathy, but may also suggest cortical irritability in the frontal regions.
No clear electrographic seizures were seen.
Improvement of bilateral basilar atelectasis with stable appearance to retrocardiac opacity and small bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 y/o female with COPD, HTN, alcoholism who presented with worsening stridor, tubated for enlarging mediastinal mass eroding into the trachea.
* Mediastinal mass: CT showed esophageal mass eroding into trachea as well as into aorta.
OSH biopsy demonstrated a squamous cell CA.
Patient was intubated on [**1-18**] for worsening stridor.
Stent of esophagus by GI was considered, but GI deferred stent given proximity to aorta and pt's mental status -> patient's daughter supported decision for no procedures.
* MS changes: Patient had remained very sedated after having been off sedation for several days.
Ammonia and b12 levels normal.
Patient later appeared to be slightly more arousable, suggesting this was due to a problem with medication clearance or metabolic derangements.
EEG [**2198-1-24**] showed moderately severe encephalopathy.
* Leukocytosis: Likely secondary to klebsiella UTI, treated with ceftriaxone.
No evidence of underlying pneumonia.
No sign of active bleeding.
* Metabolic acidosis: Non-gap acidosis initially.
Thought to be due to saline and possibly a small component of hypoperfusion.
* EtOH abuse: Pt was initially considered at risk for withdrawal.
* Hypothyroidism: TSH normal, free T4 slightly low, felt to be euthyroid sick syndrome in setting of acute illness.
