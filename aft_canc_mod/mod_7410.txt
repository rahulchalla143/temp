HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old male with known metastatic prostate cancer to the liver and bone who was recently discharged from the [**Hospital1 346**] after a lower gastrointestinal bleed thought to be radiation prostatitis and hemorrhoids, status post Vergon laser treatment.
He subsequently had progressive difficulty with swallowing at home and through to have worsening mucositis.
He now presents after having worsened mucositis with some associated shortness of breath, increasing cough.
In the emergency department he was found to be tachycardic with an elevated respiratory rate, systolic blood pressures in the high 90s as well as a lactate of 8.0 and medical criteria for sepsis protocol.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Prostate cancer with known metastasis to the liver and bone.
3) History of GI bleed secondary to radiation prostatitis, status post Argon laser treatment [**4-24**] and 20.
ALLERGIES:  Patient has no known drug allergies.
Physical examination - general appearance - patient sitting upright, cachectic, in respiratory distress with notable respiratory secretions.
Head and neck examination: notable for severe mucositis involving soft palate and tongue.
Neck notable for hematoma around the left internal jugular site.
Neck supple, no jugular venous distention noted.
Lungs: Patient did not take deep inspirations, no wheezes noted.
Some decreased breath sounds at the bases.
Cardiac examination: tachycardic, mild systolic ejection murmur somewhat difficult to assess given respiratory secretions.
Abdomen:  positive bowel sounds, somewhat distended and tympanic, no rebound noted.
Extremities:  2 to 3+ pitting edema on the right lower extremity, 2+ pitting edema of the left lower extremity, right greater than left.
Elevated liver function tests and AST of 176, ALT of 33.
Chest x-ray showing no evidence of pneumonia with some small bilateral pleural effusions.
EKG:  sinus tachycardia with no acute changes.
Sepsis:  Patient was placed on sepsis protocol although his elevated lactates are likely in part due to his known liver metastasis and tachycardia possibly related to severe pain related to his worsening mucositis.
He was no longer neutropenic and became afebrile.
The source of his infection was not identified and his cultures remained negative at which time his antibiotics were discontinued.
Hematology oncology:  Patient was continued on finasteride and was initially given vitamin K for elevated INR.
Some mild schistocytes on smear with some elevated fibrin degradation products, however, did not have evidence of EIC on subsequent laboratories.
Again it was discussed with the family the patient had an extremely poor prognosis given his known metastatic disease.
Mucositis/pain control:  Patient has severe mucositis and was no longer able to take p.o.
Code status:  Although the exact etiology of the patient's current infection was somewhat unclear, it was related to the family that his long term prognosis was extremely poor given his extensive need for pain control.
