Daughter states that she thought her O2 (uses home o2) was not working, said she felt SOB and called out for help.
She did not note any chest pain at the time.
Pt was still hypotensive so left sc line was put in and caused a second hematoma.
An EKG showed ST elevations in leads I, II AVR and V2-V6.
Pt was taken to cath emergently d/t ST changes and hypotension thought to be from cardiogenic shock.
Past Medical History: PMH: unclear, daughter is a poor historian, has h/o breast ca and possible pulmonary fibrosis, may also have dx of lung ca, HTN  Social History: Social hx: pt lives at home with daughter, has been noted to be very depressed lately d/t the loss of two family members.
Does not drink or smoke.

Massive gastric distension.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.

An EKG showed ST elevations in leads I, II AVR and V2-V6.
Pt was taken to cath emergently d/t ST changes and hypotension thought to be from cardiogenic shock.
The cath showed: LMCA, LCX: no significant disease LAD: mild diffuse irregularirties RCA: 50-60% ostial with catheter damping LV: LVEF 20% with apical ballooning --moderately elevated left sided and severely elevated right sided filling pressures; severe pulm htn, severely depressed CO, apical ballooning syndrom vs acute myocarditis.
co 2.6  ci 1.5 MAPs: RA 19 [**MD Number(3) 64077**] 22 AO 64 An echo was done during the cath that showed no evidence of a pericardial effusion.
It was decided to hold her heparin drip until the AM and then start at a low dose b/c of hematomas and bleeding.
It was thought that the patient had Takotsubo cardiomyopathy secondary to the stress of watching the news related to terrorist activity in [**Location (un) 311**].
An echo was done two days after admission and showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function.
Right ventricular free wall hypokinesis c/w possible ischemia (given normal PA systolic pressure).
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Pt's CXR at admission showed possible ARDS, pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
Pt could have had fluid overload in lungs secondary to systolic dysfuction.
Pt did not have fevers, however.
There was also a h/o pulmonary fibrosis, breast and lung cancer.
Family declined to have an autospys performed.
Acute blood loss anemia: Pt's hct has dropped significantly in the past day.
