His symptoms began about a month ago when he noted the onset of a dry, paroxysmal, cough initially associated with one brief post-tussive syncope.

About 5 days prior to admission, he noted his shortness of breath got appreciably worse: while walking in his garden he noted significantly dyspnea.
His PCP sent him to the ED at [**Hospital1 **] for these complaints; he had a CXR there which showed left pleural effusion and widening of his mediastinum.
CTA showed no PE, but large pericardial effusion, left pleural effusion, and mediastinal adenopathy.
He had a bedside US done at [**Hospital1 **] which showed mild RV collapse at diastole but no hypotension was noted.
Repeat bedside echo showed no echocardiographic evidence of tamponade physiology.
There was no evidence of RV diastolic collapse.
ROS:  Positive for non-drenching night sweats, recent weight loss of [**11-9**] lbs, with no unusual bleeding/bruising, chest pain, palpitations, PND, orthopnea.

NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2184-7-12**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2184-7-15**]):    NO GROWTH.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2184-7-10**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO MYCOBACTERIA ISOLATED  Brief Hospital Course: This is a 45 year old male with no significant past medical history presenting with 3 weeks of dry cough, tachycardia, and subjective dyspnea who was found to have cardiac tamponade and primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma.
# Pericardial/pleural effusion - Developed in the setting of 3 weeks of indolent symptoms of cough, non-drenching night sweats, fevers.
He was found on lymph node biopsy to have a primary b cell lymphoma.
Pt was found to have propionum bacterium acnes infection of pericardial fluid as well as staph epidermidis and was started on vancomycin while sensitvities were being awaited from [**Hospital3 **].
Echo prior to discharge showed resolution of pericardial fluid.
he also had large pleural effusions which were successfully drained with chest tube removed prior to discharge.
Hypodense Liver lesions.He also had hypodense liver lesions that had been noted on abdominal CT.Liver MRI was limited, and liver lesions could not be assessed.
# Tachycardia - Likely in setting of underlying effusion, resulting in reduction in cardiac output with compensatory tachycardia.
Patient also has increased insensible water loss due to night sweats.
# Cough - Likely secondary to underlying effusion as noted above.
Patient was managed symptomatically with cough supressants.
# Lymphadenopathy: CT shows extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

Clotrimazole 1 % Cream Sig: One (1) Appl Topical [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for tinea corporis.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with tachycardia and cough.
CT showed several lymph nodes as well as pleural and pericardial fluids in your chest and a biopsy was performed.
You were found to have a primary mediastinal lymphoma and you were treated with chemotherapy and you improved.
We added guafenesin as needed for cough We added benzonatate as needed for cough We added zofran as needed for nausea.
The infectious diseases doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] contact [**Name5 (PTitle) **] if there needs to be a change made in your antibiotics.
