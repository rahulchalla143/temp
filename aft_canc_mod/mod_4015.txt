On arrival here had SBP in 80's with HR in 80's which quickly improved with 2L NS to 120's SBP.
Discussion with longtime partner, fiance [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known lastname 4887**], she has not been eating well for a long time and had had two weeks of diarrhea and some left sided abdominal pain.
Past Medical History: -Stage IIIb cervical ca diagnosed in [**3-15**] s/p carboplatin, XRT and brachtherapy, initially diagnosed with hydroureter bilateral obstructions resulting in nephrostomies -urosepsis [**1-12**] to infected nephrostomy tubes in [**7-15**] s/p 2 weeks of cefotaxime for resistant e.coli in blood and urine -CRI last creatine 3.4 after hx of recurrent obsctruction -hx of MRSA in urine -FTT -anemia -hx of sacral decub   Social History: currently lives at rehab but previously living with fiance who she has been with for 19 years, smoker, denies ETOH, retired factory worker   Family History: sister w/ ?
Allowing for limitations of lack of intravenous contrast, oral contrast and distention, there is bowel wall thickening involving a long segment of the distal colon, which could be consistent with a colitis, most likely infectious.
Urine distended bladder with subtle bladder wall thickening and a tiny focus of air.
The bladder wall thickening could be potentially due to chronic outflow obstruction from the large fibroids, which extend to the deep pelvis.
Clinical correlation and history of instrumentation is advised given the focus of air.
Bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes without evidence of hydronephrosis.
Findings most consistent with a left adrenal adenoma.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 yo woman with stage III cervical ca s/p bilateral nephrostomy tubes and recent admission for urosepsis here with fever, lethargy  # Urosepsis: Recent hx of resistant e.coli infection requiring admission to [**Hospital 756**] Hospital, s/p 14 days cefotaxime following change in one of her nephrostomy tubes due to obstruction on presentation.
Patient has remained afebrile and WBC trending downward on aztreonam.
# Colitis: CT w/ bowel wall thickening and stool positive for c diff.
There may be a component of radiation colitis as well.
# Stage III cervical ca: Discussed with patient's outpatient oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], from Farber re: tx plan.
# Metabolic acidosis: Both gap and non-gap acidosis on initial presentation.
Non-gap likley related to her diarrhea/colitis at rehab prior to admission, and gap likey secondary to lactate from sepsis.
There was likely also a componant of renal insufficiency in alkali losses.
Aggressive bicarb repletion was given to help correct her acidosis, as with respiratory drive has CO2 down to 19 and did not want this to drop further.
Her acidosis fully resolved on her 3rd hospital day.
