Admission Date:  [**2168-12-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2168-12-23**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**] Chief Complaint: dizziness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Resuscitation  History of Present Illness: 88yo man with PMH significant for HTN and prostate cancer presents with approximately one year of "dizziness."
Since then, he has had an extensive workup, including MRI/MRAs x 2, which has shown that he has had a stroke in the past.
He reports increasing difficulty walking, though he lives by himself, and is still able to get around his house while holding on to objects in his home.
He describes his dizziness as a "heaviness" in his head that occurs mostly upon standing up, though it can occur when lying in bed with change in position.
He reports associated nausea, no vomiting.
Neither were associated with bowel or bladder incontinence or loss of consciousness.
ROS is significant for hearing loss in his right ear x years.
Past Medical History: arthritis asthma s/p cholecystecomy [**12-16**] s/p CVA prostate cancer back surgery for ruptured disc infection in back fractured leg and ankle   Social History: lives alone, operating engineer quit smoking [**2123**], denies EtOH, drugs  Family History: noncontributory  Physical Exam: VS: afebrile, HR 72, BP 183/85, RR 14, SaO2 100%/RA, not orthostatic Genl: pleasant elderly man alert in bed HEENT: NCAT, conjunctiva clear, fundi clear, MMM, OP clear; tympanic membrane clear on R, nonvisualized on left secondary to pts significant pain with exam Neck: no LAD CV: RRR, nl S1, S2, no S3, S4, no m/r/g Lungs: CTA bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi Abd: soft, nontender, nondistended, BS+, no hepatosplenomegaly, no rebound/guarding Ext: warm and dry, L>R (atrophy on R), R foot s/p injury, thenar atrophy, PP 2+ in LLE, 1+ in RLE Neuro: CNII-XII intact w/ occasional counterclockwise torsional nystagmus on right gaze, no vertical nystagmus, and hearing decreased in R ear, fairly preserved in L. Strength preserved in BUE in all muscle groups except 4+ grip in L, 4 grip in R. Strength preserved in BLE except decreased plantarflexion of R foot.
No diagnostic abnormality.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
No evidence of consolidation.
Bilateral symmetric increased interstitial opacities with bilateral septal lines.
Statistically this is most likely due to interstitial pulmonary edema.
Nevertheless the heart is of normal size and there are no pleural effusions.
If this findings persist after diuresis, other causes of interstitial lung disease should be considered and high resolution CT of the chest should be performed.
L knee xray: Advanced medial osteoarthritis of the left knee and small joint effusion.
BLE u/s: There is extensive acute intraluminal occlusive thrombus involving the deep veins of the left side extending from the below-knee tibial veins to the level of and involving the common femoral vein.
This is non-vascular and is not thought to represent a vascular lesion.The intracystic echogenic material probably represents fibrinous debris and/or clot.
The deep veins of the right groin appear compressible with normal augmentation and respiratory variation.
A small amount of circumferential thickening on the right side may represent recanalization from the previous DVT.The remainder of the right leg is not examined.
Extensive deep venous thrombosis on left side.
Possible chronic nonocclusive recanalized thrombosis of right SFV.
Renal u/s: The right kidney measures 10.3 cm.
There is no hydronephrosis or stones.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 88 yo man with HTN, prostate ca w/ poss mets to bone, previous CVA, here for dizziness after extensive outpt workup with unknown findings.
He was found to have an extensive DVT on his second hospital day, [**12-19**], and was receiving anticoagulation and further evaluation for dizziness when on the night of [**12-20**] he went into PEA arrest, was recusitated by the code team, and transferred to MICU.
However, he remained unresponsive with questionable hope for improvement.
Dizziness: Differential diagnosis included central, peripheral, and cardiogenic etiologies.
Suspected peripheral causes included BPPV or vestibular neuritis possibly from vertebrobasilar insufficiency.
Pt had intermittent rotational nystagmus.
Central etiologies were also considered and included: a) mets to the brain from metastatic prostate cancer; b) spinal involvement from prostate cancer; c) new brain infarcts from additional, perhaps "silent" CVAs; d) processes affecting the vestibular nerve, such as schwannomas, although pt did not report tinnitus or other findings characteristic for acoustic neuromas.
Cardiogenic causes for pt's dizziness seemed less likely.
He also had normal EKG findings, no cardiac/pulmonary symptoms, and no hx of palpitations, arrhythmias, or heart disease.
Additionally, the pt had other causes contributing to gait instability and increased fall risk.
He was started on calcium and vitamin D.  For adjunctive treatments related to his dizziness, pt was receiving ASA 81 and compazine PRN.
DVT: on [**12-19**], the pt had sudden onset of left knee pain and swelling while walking with his physical therapist.
The knee was warm and erythematous with anterior and posterior/popliteal swelling and within an hour the erythema had extended up to his mid-thigh and his left foot was reported to have cyanotic changes.
He was sent to U/S and found to have an extensive DVT in his left leg involving tibial and femoral veins, as well as a complicated [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst, and possible chronic nonocclusive thrombosis of the right SFV.
He had a significant risk factor, hypercoagulability from his prostate cancer.
Increased interstitial opacities on CXR - Though these were concerning for CHF or PNA, he was asymptomatic.
No antibiotics or diuretics were started.
Renal insufficiency - He was noted to have a creatinine of 1.5 at [**Hospital1 **].
Urine electrolytes revealed a FENa of 0.65%, BUN/CR ~ 20, suggesting a prerenal process.
A renal ultrasound to assess for postobstructive process showed no hydronephrosis.
HTN - Well controlled on 25mg metoprolol [**Hospital1 **], withdrawn when pt was made CMO.
Prostate cancer - Oncology was consulted.
Asthma - Continued albuterol during the hospitalization until CMO.
Leukocytosis - The patient was noted to have a leukocytosis with lymphocytic predominance.
