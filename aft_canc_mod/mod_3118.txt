Admission Date:  [**2123-2-10**]     Discharge Date: [**2123-3-1**]  Date of Birth:   [**2069-4-3**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 53-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, status post chemotherapy treatment leading to myelodysplastic syndrome and subsequently to acute myelogenous leukemia, who is now at day plus 97 status post allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplant, who presents with a history of fevers and a new radiologic finding of a left upper lobe nodule.
The patient was evaluated at the clinic on [**2-9**] for a fever to 100.3.
She noted a history of a nonproductive cough, persistent upper respiratory infection symptoms with sneezing that causes a left upper chest discomfort and slight pleuritic pain.
She noted a decreased appetite in the past few days with nausea.
She noted a new bilateral back pain that has increased in the sitting position and worse with some movements.
She denies diarrhea, abdominal pain, or sore throat.
This back pain has lasted one week.
She has no dysuria or urinary frequency.
Secondary myelodysplastic syndrome leading to acute myelogenous leukemia by bone marrow biopsy in [**2122-1-28**]; now at day plus 97 status post allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplant from a [**7-4**] matched sibling donor.
The course has been complicated with an admission for diarrhea in [**2122-12-28**] with cytomegalovirus colitis/graft-versus-host disease diagnosed.
History of breast cancer diagnosed in [**2117**]; status post right mastectomy and right axillary lymph node dissection; status post CALGB chemotherapy regimen subsequently leading to myelodysplastic syndrome (as described above).
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Graft-versus-host disease (grade 2); treated with prednisone.
History of suspected Aspergillus with a video-assisted thoracic surgery done in [**2122-9-28**] which showed evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Flat affect, pale, very thin, slightly cachectic woman in no acute distress.
There was no lymphadenopathy.
Extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Skin with no rashes and no lesions.
Back revealed bilateral costovertebral angle tenderness to palpation with mild perivertebral tenderness.
Viral culture was negative for influenza A/B.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest computed tomography with contrast revealed (1) slightly speculated 1.4-cm left upper lobe nodule which had arisen since the prior chest computed tomography in [**2122-10-28**]; given the patient's fever this most likely represents an infectious process, consider Aspergillosis; (2) probable radiation changes at the right apex unchanged; and, (3) persistent right-sided pleural effusion which had decreased in size since previous chest computed tomography on [**2122-11-23**].
A chest x-ray revealed a new ill-defined nodular opacity in the left upper lobe concerning for atypical infection, stable appearance of the chest with right apical pleural opacity and right-sided volume loss.
LEFT UPPER LOBE LUNG MASS ISSUES:  The left upper lobe lung mass was highly suspicious for an infection.
The Interventional Radiology team was then consulted who determined that the location of the lesion was not accessible by computed tomography scan biopsy due to obstruction by surrounding vessels.
Therefore, the Cardiothoracic Surgery team was consulted for a video-assisted thoracic surgery.
Also on [**2-12**], the Infectious Disease team was consulted who agreed with the plan for a video-assisted thoracic surgery and had recommendations for cultures to be sent in addition to pathology.
They had other recommendations; including obtaining a magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic spine to rule out the possibility of a paraspinal or epidural abscess accounting for her ongoing new back pain and to consider an echocardiogram to rule out the small possibility of septic embolus from the vegetation.
It was unclear if this represented contamination or true bacteremia.
The patient did finally go to have video-assisted thoracic surgery on [**2-20**].
At the time of this dictation, the patient had been afebrile on Bactrim but was having complications of nausea with this therapy.
The patient did develop a new oxygen requirement of 2 liters which was thought to possibly be related to her worsening right pleural effusion but was still being evaluated at the time of this dictation.
The patient did not have any diarrhea or skin lesions to suggest active graft-versus-host disease.
Her oral intake worsened during her hospital stay to a point where she was transitioned to total parenteral nutrition on [**2-26**] after having several days with minimal intake.
DERMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient was noted to have an unusual 1.5 cm purple erythematous lesion on the right lateral aspect of her lower leg.
This lesion was suspicious for a septic embolus, and a Dermatology consultation was obtained and a biopsy was done.
The biopsy with associated cultures did show microabscesses but did grow out gram-positive rods consistent with nocardia.
NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient was found to have a left upper lobe nodule that nocardia growth and Dermatology biopsy that had nocardia growth.
Given the 40% chance of central nervous system involvement and the patient's worsening mental status on the dates of [**2-25**] and [**2-26**], a magnetic resonance imaging was done which did show two lesions that sere suggestive of infection; likely to be nocardia given this clinical scenario.
The magnetic resonance imaging showed a small 5-mm ring enhancing lesion in the left occipital lobe with associated edema and a small 3-mm lesion within the right cerebellar hemisphere.
Also, bilateral changes of mastoiditis were noted.
HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY ISSUES:  On [**2-26**], the patient was noted to have blasts in her peripheral blood smear.
This worsening renal function was thought to be related to medications; in particular AmBisome and cyclosporine were suspected to be causing renal insufficiency.
The patient did initially respond to a decrease in her cyclosporine and adjustment of some of her medications; however, at the time of this dictation, her creatinine remained at 2 despite serial decreases in her cyclosporine.
The possibility that intravenous Bactrim was contributing to her renal insufficiency was being explored.
ORTHOPAEDIC ISSUES:  The patient did fall to her coccyx on [**2-25**] and had a resulting hematoma at the site.
Imaging of the area was not done, and her pain was controlled with a patient-controlled analgesia.
The patient did report improvement in this painful site, and the hematoma was resolving with conservative management.
RESPIRATORY ISSUES:  The patient was stable on room air throughout her hospital stay until [**2-27**] when she developed a new oxygen dependence of 2 liters.
A chest x-ray was done at the time of this new oxygen requirement and showed multifocal infiltrates; one of which, in the right upper lobe, appeared larger, and the remaining infiltrates were without significant change.
The right pleural effusion did persist.
At the time of this dictation, the patient had been started on meropenem, and the possibility of a pleural effusion thoracentesis was being considered.
