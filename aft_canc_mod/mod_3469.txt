R paraspinal fluid collections with rim enhancement and increasing amount of air within , concerning for paraspinal abscess.
There is enhancement of the thecal sac.No definite cord compression is seen, but this study is limited given the streak artifacts.
Significant distention of the gall bladder, correlate clinically for signs of acute cholecystitis.
Known metastatic disease  CT Torso [**2111-12-6**]  1.
Expected postoperative changes at the lower thoracic spine as described above, with a small amount of residual post-surgical gas and fluid.
No findings to suggest abdominal or pelvic abscess.
Stable appearance of known pulmonary metastatic disease.
Appearances are consistent with an enterocutaneous fistula passing from the right upper quadrant via the surgical drain tract to the skin at the level of the surgical incision.
Enhancement of the paraspinal muscles suggestive of inflammation, no collection seen.
Duodenal diverticulum.
On [**12-5**], he underwent incision and drainage of his infected surgical wound with placement of a drain and tolerated this procedure very well with no complications.
This was reevaluated on [**12-6**] and was 134 without treatment.
He was experiencing pain at his surgical site a level of 5 on a [**12-14**] pain scale.
His pain medications were reviewed and the patient was not maximizing the currently ordered doses of pain medication.This was discussed with the patient and nursing.
This was stable with only minimal residual fluid collection at surgical site.
The JP drain remained in place due to high output and he was continued on his antibiotic regimen per the ID team.
His pain was better controlled with PO dilaudid every three hours and he required less IV pain medication for breakthrough.
His wound continued to drain copious amounts of fluid, he was maintained on IV antibiotics with ID consultation as cultures grew enterococcus.
He underwent CT of abdomen which showed and enteric fistula.
He had been scheduled to return to OR for thoracic washout [**12-10**] but in light of fistula this was cancelled as would not provide any relief to drainage of wound.
Surgery would be extensive and high risk with likely more risk than benefit.
He will maintain on antibiotics and pain medication and will take PO only for comfort.
