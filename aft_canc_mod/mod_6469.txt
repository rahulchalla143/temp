Hemorrhage in large left renal cyst.
Abdominal free fluid, not evidence of hemoperitoneum.
Innumerable pulmonary nodules and diffuse hypodensities in liver, concerning for metastates.
Diffuse osseous metastatic disease and lymphadenopathy, unchanged.
X-ray L Femur, L knee: Diffuse sclerotic metastatic dz in L hemi-pelvis.
Unchanged sclerosis of L femoral head c/w avascular necrosis.
No acute fx or dislocations.
X-ray shoulder, elbow: No acute fracture or dislocation.
No joint effusion.
CT HEAD: No acute intracranial abnormality.
CT C-SPINE: No acute fracture or dislocation.
Severe degenerative changes of cervical spine.
Sclerotic changes in left 3rd rib, consistent with metastatic disease.
Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is an 81 year-old male with history of prostate cancer (followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on Docetaxel, DVT on coumadin, CKD (baseline Cr 1.7) presenting with left flank pain, epigastric pain, and worsening fatigue after sliding down stairs at home.
Found to have hemorrhage of a large left renal cyst requiring brief ICU admission for hemodynamic monitoring.
Evidence of trauma includes hemorrhage in large left renal cyst, abdominal free fluid (no evidence of hemoperitoneum), and fractures of left 7th-11th ribs.
Was seen by trauma surgery who felt there were no acute surgical issues.
No other fractures or dislocations based on imaging.
Low suspicion for syncopal event leading to fall, though patient does endorse intermittent dizziness with standing suggestive of orthostasis.
Anemia: No evidence of acute blood loss.
Hemorrhagic renal cyst contained within capsule based on imaging.
Suspect worsening anemia may be related to taxotere (Nadir - 7 days).
Urology commented that if no hematuria and HCT is stable, there is nothing to do but let the hemorrhage resolve on its own.
Difficult to tell if the free fluid is a urinoma or not, the only imaging that could potentially tell the difference is a CT with contrast with delayed phase to look for extravasation, would only be indicated if he develops a fever, UTI or hematuria - as he was stable with no hematuria, evidence of UTI, or hematuria this was not done.
In the setting of persistent fevers and neutropenia, he was started on vancomycin this was discontinued once ANC had recovered.
No additional cultures were positive, although cultures from [**12-23**], [**12-24**], and [**12-25**] were pending at the time of discharge.
Neutropenia: Likely secondary to taxotere as around nadir period of 7 days, patient was treated supportively until counts recovered.
[**Last Name (un) **]: Suspect pre-renal etiology in setting of poor PO intake over last few days.
Coumadin was initially held due to renal hemorrhage, but restarted at home dose of 6 mg QD prior to discharge INR was 2.7.
L flank/leg pain: Leg pain likely secondary to diffuse osseus disease in setting of metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Rib pain secondary to fractures.
He was gicen incentive spirometry and pulmonary toilet.
Metastatic prostate cancer: Recently initiated on taxotere on [**2135-12-15**].
4. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 11729**] Nursing Care Center  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: -Mechanical Fall -Hemorrhagic Renal Cyst -Neutropenic Fever -Metastatic Prostate Cancer  SECONDARY: - Chronic Kidney Disease (baseline 1.6-1.7) - Hypertension - Left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis - Avascular necrosis of the left hip   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were noted to have a small bleed in your kidney and were therefore observed overnight in the intensive care unit.
You also had very low white blood cell levels as a result of your reccent chemotherapy and were given antibiotics while you were having fevers.
The following changes were made to your medications: -START lidocaine 5% patch applied to the left chest daily until pain resolves  Followup Instructions: Department: HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY When: THURSDAY [**2136-1-5**] at 11:00 AM With: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 2946**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3217**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 22**] Building: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) 24**] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage  Department: HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY When: THURSDAY [**2136-1-5**] at 12:00 PM With: [**Doctor First Name **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], RN [**Telephone/Fax (1) 22**] Building: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) 24**] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage
