Ms. [**Known lastname 54295**] was diagnosed in [**2166-11-11**] with acute myeloblastic leukemia when she presented with the neutropenia and low-grade fevers.
The bone marrow was diagnostic for acute myeloblastic leukemia.
( 7+3;5+2) Following induction,  she received three cycles of high-dose ARA-C consolidation therapy.
BmBX [**5-11**] demonstrated hypopocellular marrow (5%) with left-shifted myelopoiesis and focal interstitial clusters of immature mononuclear cells suspicious for blasts.
Ms. [**Known lastname 54295**] notes a two day history of intermittent myalgias, head ache, low-grade fevers, mild odynophagia and chest pain.
Pt denies any cough, sinus pain, ear pain, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, pain or burning on urination, neck stiffness, or photophobia.
She was seen 3 days ago for follow up after being place on Neurontin 300mg qd for lower extremity peripheral neuropathy and pain and was doing well.
(e)  she is status post HIDAC consolidation in [**2166-12-28**], complicated by fever and neutropenia with no clear source with an admission in [**2167-1-26**].
(f)  status post HIDAC two on [**2167-1-26**] with mild transaminitis (last dose held).
No sinus tenderness.
Throat is mildly injected.
She has tenderness over the left subauricular area  and no crepitus.
No cervical, supraclavicular, occipital adenopathy.
No murmurs, rubs, thrills, or gallops.
CHEST: Indwelling line, with no sign of erythema, and no tenderness to palpation over line.
ABDOMEN: Nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly, no rebound.
No inguinal adenopathy.
SKIN: No cutaneous lesions.
Rectal exam deferred d/t neutropenia.

Note:  The morphologic findings are worrisome for minimal involvement by patient's known acute leukemia.
An alternative consideration includes early recovery.
There is an interstitial infiltrate of immature mononuclear cells consistent with blasts occurring singly and in small clusters occupying 30% of marrow cellularity.
The aspirate smear shows hypocellular spicules with many stripped nuclei.
Myeloid and erythroid cells appear decreased.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. [**Known lastname 54295**] [**Known firstname **] is a 39-year-old woman with relapsed acute myeloblastic leukemia, admitted for 2 day hx of myalgias, mild sore throat and febrile neutropenia.
Pt grew out coag neg staph, fairly resistant to most ABx, but clincally improved on the current regimen.
Because of this, patient is to be given a TTE, ruled out for endocarditis, and once stable home on Abx.
Neutropenic Fever -Pt was in unit for 2 days for sepsis, now currently afebrile on cefepime/daptomycin.
-Continue cefepime for neutropenic fever coverage.
?t be drawn d/t overseeding with bacteria.
f/u once cleared of bacterial infection -ID following.
Tachycardic- resolved -Likely early sepsis vs. dehydration.
F/E/N -Neutropenic diet.
Acetaminophen-Caff-Butalbital [**Medical Record Number 3668**] mg Tablet Sig: [**11-29**] Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for headache.
Discharge Diagnosis: Acute Myelocytic Leukemia   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, Stable  Discharge Instructions: Please follow up with [**Last Name (LF) 54296**],[**First Name3 (LF) 2801**] on [**6-9**] at 10am.
Please finish your course of Daptomycin  Please call you doctor if you experience a fever over 100.4C, chills, nausea, vomitting, or worsening headache.
