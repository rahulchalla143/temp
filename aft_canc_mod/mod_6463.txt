At rest he did not have any symptoms, but has Hx of vimiting and nausea.
He went to an outside hospital where a head CT revealed an approximately 4 x 5 cm left cerebellar mass with resulting effacement of the fourth ventricle and enlargement of lateral and third ventricles.
The patient underwent a ventriculostomy due to his complaints of headache and intermittent nausea.
No pronator drift, or dysmetria noted.
Surgical incision is clean dry and intact.

Blood products are seen at the margin of the surgical cavity with mild slow diffusion at this region.
There is meningeal enhancement seen at the superior aspect of the surgical cavity on post-gadolinium images without evidence of nodular areas of residual enhancement.
There is persistent mild deformity of the fourth ventricle seen, which has decreased from previous study.
There is no hydrocephalus seen.
A right frontal tract is visualized extending to the right lateral ventricle.
Soft tissue changes are seen in the left temporoparietal region with swelling and air within this area most likely related to surgery.
IMPRESSION: Status post resection of left cerebellar mass with no residual nodular area of enhancement.
Mild meningeal enhancement is seen at the superior aspect of the surgical cavity and blood products are seen at the margin.
Decrease mass effect noted.
No acute infarct seen.
CT head [**2128-11-19**]: FINDINGS: Since the previous MRI study the patient has undergone occipital craniectomy with resection of previously seen hemorrhagic mass in the left cerebellar hemisphere.
There continues to be mass effect on the fourth ventricle which is only partially visualized.
There is no hydrocephalus seen.
There is pneumocephalus noted.
No evidence of significant hemorrhage or hydrocephalus seen.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 14502**] was admitted for an posterior fossa resection of a cerebellar mass on [**2128-11-19**].
There were no complications.
