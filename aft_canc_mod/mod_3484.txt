Pathology demonstrated a moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma at the head of the pancreas with positive margins at the SMA and with positive lymph nodes, eight out of eight.
he then underwent a right VATS for lund nodules which showed pancreatic adneocarcinoma.
A CAT scan done on [**11-26**] showed some progression of the target lesions in his lungs so he was removed from protocol.
He received no treatment since infusional Gemcitabine until his CAT scan showed new multiple hepatic metastases.
