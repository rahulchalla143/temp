Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2183-7-23**]: bronchoscopy and mediastonoscopy [**2183-7-25**]: LUL segmentectomy, LLL wedge resection   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 2970**] is a 77-year-old gentleman, referred by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1391**] to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for advice and options regarding a carcinoma of the lung detected during recent hospitalization for coronary disease and a large aortic aneurysm in [**2183-5-8**].
A lesion in the left lung was discovered in the upper lobe and a needle biopsy confirmed non-small cell carcinoma.
He underwent a PET scan, which showed extreme hypermetabolism with an SUV of 17 at the site of the lung primary lesion.
There is sparse uptake within the mediastinum, not considered of pathologic significance, as well as active inflammation around the abdominal graft.
Past Medical History: Significant for coronary disease, status post an infarction.
He has aortic aneurysm, increased serum cholesterol, prostate cancer, and carcinoma of the sigmoid colon.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Sigmoid colectomy in [**2171**], radical prostatectomy in [**2169**], and the tube graft repair of his abdominal aortic aneurysm.
He has no active alcohol issues.
HEART:  Regular rhythm and rate without murmur or gallop.
NECK:  There were no carotid bruits.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender with good healing ridge along the wound.
EXTREMITIES:  He has no peripheral edema.
He was noted to have significant bradycardia prior to starting the operation.
He did undergo a flexible bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy that was complicated by substantial intraoperative bleeding.
He was subsequently ruled out for a cardiac event, and remained hemodynamically and neurologically stable on POD#1.
On HD#3, the decision was made to proceed with a segmental resection given the T2 size of the lesion and his limited baseline lung function.
Two left-sided chest tubes were placed intraoperatively, and a post-operative chest radiograph showed a moderate left sided pneumothorax.
The Acute Pain Service continued to follow the patient for management of the epidural catheter.
His chest tubes were placed to water seal, and a chest radiograph showed very slight increase in left pneomothorax.
A chest radiograph that was done after these changes were made showed no acute or concerning changes in the left pneumothorax.
A PA and lateral chest radiograph showed decreased left-sided pneumothorax and interstitial edema since the prior examination, with small bilateral pleural effusions.
On [**2183-7-29**], he underwent a video swallow study which revealed a left vocal cord paralysis.
A chest radiograph performed on [**2183-7-29**] showed further improvement in the small left apical pneumothorax and improvement in the interstitial edema.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
