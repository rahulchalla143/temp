Admission Date:  [**2138-2-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-3-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2066-5-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**] Chief Complaint: Large L sided ICH   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubated hemodialysis   History of Present Illness: Pt.
is a 71 y/o with a hx of aneurysm and resultant L sided stroke, stomach CA (active) and Colon CA (in remission) who is transferred for further management of ICH.
On repeat exam he was more drowsy, so Head CT was ordered, and showed a large L sided ICH with interventricular extension and subfalcine shift.
Neurosurgery was consulted emergently and Head CT was repeated (see read below) and showed a 7 cm x 6.5 cm hemorrhage with extension to the lateral, 3rd, and 4th ventricles.
Neurosurgery felt that given the size of the hemorrhage there was no utility in EVD placement.
Past Medical History: - s/p aneurysm rupture 30 years ago with SAH and stroke, s/p clipping, with residual R hemiparesis (arm > leg) and aphasia - Seizure d/o since stroke - Colon CA [**2121**], in remission - Stomach CA, active - ESRD on HD (TuThSat) - DVT s/p IVC filter placement - HTN  Social History: Lives with wife, [**Name (NI) **] EtOH, no tobacco  Family History: [**Doctor Last Name **] syndrome  Physical Exam: (off propofol x 5 min) BP- 115/69 HR- 86 RR- 15 O2Sat- 100% on CMV 500/15/5/100% Gen: Lying in bed, intubated HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa Neck: supple CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally aBd: +BS soft, nontender ext: no edema  Neurologic examination: Mental status: opens eyes briefly to sternal rub, regards examiner, will inconsistently squeeze L hand on command but will not open or close eyes on command  Cranial Nerves: Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 3 to 2 mm bilaterally.

Extension of blood is seen into the lateral ventricles, third ventricle, and a small amount in the fourth ventricle.
Extra-axial blood is also seen along the inner table of the skull overlying the left anterior falx, left frontal lobe, and the anterior parietal lobe and superior temporal lobe.
It measures 6 mm in greatest axial thickness.
The hemorrhage causes some mild rightward shift of the septum pellucidum and other midline structures, approximately 6 mm.
The right cerebral hemisphere is notable for extensive hypovascular densities in the corona radiata and centrum semiovale indicating chronic microvascular change.
There is evidence of previous craniotomy on the left, and two aneurysm clips in the region of the left middle cerebral artery.
No acute fractures are identified.
Scattered opacified ethmoid air cells are noted.
There are small polyps versus retention cysts in the maxillary sinuses, one measuring 7 mm in the left, one measuring 7 mm on the right.
Large left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage superimposed on extensive encephalomalacic changes, with extension to the ventricular system including the third and fourth ventricles.
6-mm subdural hematoma overlying the left frontal, parietal, and temporal regions.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was a 71 year old with history of aneurysm rupture and resultant left-sided stroke, [**Doctor Last Name **] Syndrome with history of stomach cancer (s/p XRT) and colon cancer (s/p resection) who was transferred for further management of large intracranial and subdural hemorrhage.
On initial exam he was arousable to sternal rub but did not follow commands, had a R hemiparesis with some posturing to pain, and reactive pupils.
He was also continued on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
A repeat head CT the following morning showed no new bleeding.
CTA of head did not show extravasation of contrast but couldnot exclude bleeding from clipped aneurysm site.
R MCA 5mm aneurysm seen at bifurcation.
Repeat head CT was unchanged without any new bleeding involving the right hemisphere to explain the new left-sided weakness.
A subsequent spine CT revealed possible metastatic lesion within the superior facet of the right side of C3.
There was no evidence of cord compression above the level of C5-6.
There was a slightly rounded lucent lesion within the C7, also concerning for metastatic deposit.
Patient's prognosis was grim given diffuse metastatic disease and prior XRT of the stomach precluding further XRT to recurring cancer and likely only palliative chemotherapy.
Furthermore, patient developed a ventilator associated pneumonia and was not weanable off the ventilatory.
Patient expired from respiratory failure on [**2138-3-9**].
