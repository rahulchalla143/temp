[**3-6**]:  Neck exploration, irrigation and debridement of necrotizing fasciitis of inferior neck.
[**3-17**]:  Complex wound closure of the neck and right temporal area measuring approximately total of 20 centimeters.
PROCEDURES DURING ADMISSION [**3-4**]:  Placement of CVL (left SCL), placement of A-line (R forearm) [**3-11**]:  rewiring of CVL  CONSULTATIONS DURING [**Hospital **] Medical Intensive Care Unit Surgical Intensive Care Unit Infectious Disease Oral Maxillo-Facial Surgery Plastic Surgery Opthalmology General Surgery Medicine  BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was admitted to the MICU on [**3-3**] given the rapid progression of his facial swelling and periorbital edema.
On [**3-4**] the patient became progressively hemodynamically unstable and was started on levophed for pressure support.
CT scan of the head and neck and CTA revealed subcutaneous inflammatory changes, subgaleal soft tissue edema, right greater than left, extending into the right preauricular and preseptal areas and neck down to the level of the thyroid, but no evidence of drainable fluid collection, subcutaneous emphysema, gas formation, or thrombus.
His erythema and edema were thought initially to be improving on antibiotics, but given his hemodynamic instability and concern for necrotizing fasciitis the patient was taken to the operating room by otolaryngology on [**3-5**] for neck exploration, irrigation and debridement of necrotizing fasciitis of right face and neck and left neck.
Pathology results showed necrosis of fibroadipose and muscle, no fascia seen, abscess, and GPCs in pairs/clusters/chains.
Postoperatively the patient entered florid sepsis; he became more hemodynamically unstable and acidemic to 7.2, his WBC rose to a high of 41, and he was placed on three pressors, (levophed, neo, and vasopressin), though he continued to have urine output.
Eventually he became more hemodynamically stable, but given his continued need for pressors, leukocytosis, and spreading erythema down the chest, the patient was taken to the OR again on [**3-6**] for neck exploration, irrigation and debridement of necrotizing fasciitis of inferior neck.
On [**3-7**] he was weaned off pressors, and his white count decreased, but he developed atrial fibrillation with a regular ventricular rate but with resulting hypotension, and so was started on amiodarone.
His cultures from [**3-2**] in the blood at [**Location (un) 620**] grew Group A beta hemolytic strep; his wound cultures on [**3-4**] grew out staph coag negative and [**3-5**], [**3-6**], grew group A beta-hemolytic strep.
The tissue following debridement was noted per report to be healthy without signs of infection.
On [**3-10**] the patient was extubated without difficulty.
On [**3-10**] he was thought to be moving the right hand less than the left, and so given his previous periods of hypotension he underwent a NCHCT, that was negative for acute infarct.
On [**3-11**] his WBC rose to 24 from 16.7 and so given concern for alternate sources of infection he was checked for C dif, his CVL was changed, a UA was negative, and CXR showed b/l pleural effusions.
Though the patient had may carious teeth, they did not find any abscess or explanation for his abnormal lab values.
Clinically, however, he was improving with his wound granulating and the erythema dramatically decreasing.
Of note, no source for his infection was found, though given that his symptoms began as a sore throat he most likely had a streptococcal tonsillitis with spread across fascial planes and resulting necrotizing fasciitis.
Opthalomology came to see the patient again, and noted periorbital edema but no endopthalmos or damage to the optic nerve from the infection.
Clinically he remained slightly edematous.
The patient had a persistent leukocytosis of unclear etiology following the third operation; he was pancultured without effect; C dif was negative, CXR, UA unremarkable.
He also had a thrombocytosis that similarly began dropping following wound closure; these most likely were reactive to his open wound.
The patient also underwent a wound care consult for skin breakdown secondary to loose stool from the tube feedings in spite of regular turning.
Necrotizing Fasciitis secondary to Group A Strep:  The infection has resolved.
The wound remains partially open at the sternal notch and needs to be dressed with wet to dry sterile gauze [**Hospital1 **] with xeroform QD on the incisions all covered with kerlex until deemed necessary at the patient's follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23606**].
Atrial Fibrillation:  AF with regular VR occurred in the context of his infection and was well controlled with IV then PO amiodarone.
Anticoagulation was held as per medicine consult given the patient had an open wound with recent surgery during his hospitalization.
Type II Diabetes Mellitus:  The patient was not taking any meds for DM prior to admission; here has required high doses of insulin while on tube feeds.
He has no diagnosis of congestive heart failure and no clinical evidence, and so diuresis was discontinued on [**3-19**] per medicine recommendations.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for constipation.

Type II Diabetes Mellitus  PMx: CVA w/broca's aphasia, R sided weakness, CVA with residual mild right hemiparesis and Broca's aphasia Peripheral neuropathy, unknown etiology Hypertension Osteoarthritis s/p lap chole   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: 1.
-Wrap both incisions and sternal notch with kerlex -Right temporal area:  wet to dry sterile gauze q8h until sufficiently closed that it no longer requires.
If you develop any fever > 101.5, chills, foul smell from your wound, pus or excess fluid oozing from your wound, redness or swelling around the wounds, chest pain, or shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms, then please call our office and/or go to the Emergency Room.
