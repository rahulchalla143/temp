GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED ISSUES:  The patient was admitted with complaints of rectal bleeding with a blood loss of approximately 600 cc.
In the Emergency Department, he had another episode of rectal bleeding of approximately 100 cc.
He had an upper endoscopy which was significant only for mild gastritis.
He then had a colonoscopy which showed a fungating rectal mass thought to be the etiology of his bleeding.
His hematocrit remained stable, and he did not have any further active bleeding.
The Surgical Service also evaluated the patient and felt that the bleeding component of his rectal mass was consistent with radiation prostatitis.
RECTAL MASS ISSUES:  The patient was found to have a fungating rectal mass on colonoscopy.
There was concern for recurrence of his prostate cancer (although his prostate-specific antigen was normal) versus a rectal carcinoma primary.
Pathology of the mass was sent; however, it was not diagnostic showing cellular atypia consistent with radiation damage.
The patient had a transrectal ultrasound which showed evidence of recurrent prostate cancer with invasion into the right anterior wall of the rectum.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%.
The patient's cardiac medications were initially held upon admission given his gastrointestinal bleeding and concern for hypotension.
The patient had an episode of flash pulmonary edema which did respond well to Lasix, nitroglycerin, and hydralazine.
His symptoms improved with this regimen.
The plan was to monitor him as an outpatient, and should he begin to develop symptoms of fluid overload, he should be restarted on his daily dose of Lasix.
