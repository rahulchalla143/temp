He also noted some itchiness and irritation of his eyes for the last few days, and feeling achy overall particularly in his neck, shoulders and head.
Blood cx were drawn and  CXR showed no infiltrate so he was sent home with the dx of a viral infection.

No consolidation or effusion noted.
** Torso CT ** CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a 9 mm pretracheal lymph node and a 9 mm left axillary lymph node that are slightly increased in size compared to the prior study where they measured approximately 7 mm.
There is a 10 mm subcarinal node that previously measured 5 mm.
Lung windows demonstrate no areas of consolidation or pulmonary nodules.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is possible slight interval increase in size of the previously demonstrated mass at the mesenteric root measuring approximately 6.7 x 3.7 cm, previously 5.7 x 3.5 cm at this location on the prior scan of [**2157-1-24**].
This mesenteric mass partially encases the superior mesenteric artery and some of its side branches that appeared to be patent.
There also is interval increase in the size and number of retroperitoneal nodes, notably a 11 mm aortocaval node (series 2B, image 80), and an 8 mm paraaortic node (series 2B, image 88).
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
There is no free air or free fluid.
There are multiple small bilateral inguinal lymph nodes, the largest measuring 12 mm in the left groin, increased in size compared to the prior study where it measured approximately 7 cm in short axis diameter.
No new suspicious lytic or sclerotic foci are identified.
** liver, needle core biopsy ** -Mixed portal inflammation, including mononuclear cells, a small component of neutrophils and rare eosinophils with focal bile duct infiltration by lymphocytes and focal portal venulitis.
-Lobular neutrophilic infiltrate with focal aggregates, regeneration and apoptotic hepatocytes.
-Note: The biopsy shows features of graft vs. host disease, however, in the presence of neutrophilic infiltrate a concomitant infectious process cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: This is a 33 y/o M with hx of NHL s/p mini-MUD Allo BMT in [**7-28**], and s/p DLI 5 weeks ago who presents with fatigue, low-grade temps, diffuse rash and transaminitis * 1.
A u/s guided liver biopsy was done and was consistent with GVH but also showed neutrophilic infiltration concerning for infection.
Stains were negative for CMV and microorganisms.
Fever/malaise/cough: Before pt was started on steroids for presumed GVH, a torso CT was done to rule out infection.
Other than interval progression of disease, the CT was negative for infiltrates or source of infection.
Pt ruled out for flu, adeno, parainfluenze and other viral illnesses.
Pt had fevers to 102 during the beginning of his hospital stay but all blood and urine cx were negative.
Rash: Given the pt's hx of NHL and recent DLI along with his rising LFTs, GVH was the highest on the differential.
With the addition of the steroids, the rash resolved over the next several days.
