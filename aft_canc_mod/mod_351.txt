An MRI of the pelvis was ordered to look for ancillary mass compressing the lumbosacral plexus.
CT-chest at OSH and X-ray show large cavitary lesion in the right chest.
Per the patient's PCP the CT was read as worrysome for bronchogenic carcinoma.
A BAL was negative for AFB and was culture negative.
It was also negative for malignant cytology.

Able to lift right leg [**4-13**] against gravity and wekanly against my hand.
Urine cx: URINE CULTURE (Final [**2124-9-28**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Renal U/S: Evaluation of the kidneys is limited due to difficult beam penetration.
No hydronephrosis, stone, or renal masses identified.
IMPRESSION: Asymmetrically small right kidney which is consistent with provided history of congenitally small kidney.
Low voltage.
Large likely cavitary lesion seen in the right lung, measuring upwards of 12 cm in greatest dimension.
No focal consolidations or definite pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION:  Large cavitary lesion within the right lung, concerning for neoplasm.
CT would be helpful for further evaluation.
There is no abnormal signal in the vertebral bodies, spinal cord, or dural space.
At C3-4 level, there is a posterior osteophyte disc bulge, leading to right neural foramen narrowing.
There is no significant central canal narrowing.
At C4-5, there is a posterior central disc bulge, leading to anterior thecal sac deformity, as well as bilateral neural foraminal narrowing.
There is no significant central canal stenosis at this level.
At C5-6 level, there is a posterior disc bulge as well as osteophytes, leading to left greater than right neural foramen narrowing.
There is no significant spinal canal stenosis.
At C6-7 level, there is mild spondylosis, without evidence of neural foraminal or central canal narrowing.
There is accentuation of thoracic kyphosis.
There are no signal intensity abnormalities in the vertebral bodies, spinal cord or within the dural space.
At T5-6 level, there is a posterior disc bulge, without significant neural foraminal narrowing or central canal stenosis.
At T7-8 level, there is a central disc protrusion, leading to anterior thecal sac deformity without significant central canal stenosis.
At T10-11 level, there is minimal posterior disc bulge, without significant neural foraminal narrowing or central canal stenosis.
No significant abnormalities are reviewed atT11-L2 levels.
Note made of a large cavitary right lung mass.
Multilevel spondylosis, without evidence of central canal stenosis or spinal cord compression.
If not already obtained, dedicated chest CT is recommended for further evaluation of this finding.
She was weaker on the left side, especially with hip flexion but states that she has had that problem for 5 years.
Upon discharge her exam was similar with good strength in her upper extremities and R lower extremity and mild defects in the left as described above.
The neuromuscular team was consulted and had discussed the possibility of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]/[**Location (un) **] myasthenia in the setting of a possible pulomary malignancy.
An MRI of the pelvis was ordered to look for ancillary mass compressing the lumbosacral plexus.
She was evaluated by physical therapy on the day of discharge, but exam was limited by patient cooperation, however she was able to stand and shuffle a short distance with a walker.
In regards to her lung lesion, CT-chest at OSH and X-ray show large cavitary lesion in the right chest.
Per the patient's PCP the CT was read as worrysome for bronchogenic carcinoma.
A BAL was negative for AFB and was culture negative.
It was also negative for malignant cytology.
The patient was also found to be in acute on chronic renal failure upon admission with a creatinine of 3.5.
Renal U/S showed no cause for acute renal failure, no hydronephrosis.
She was also found to have a urinary tract infection (E.coli) for which she was started on ciprofloxacin on [**9-27**].
