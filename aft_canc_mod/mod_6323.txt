Admission Date:  [**2160-3-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-4-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2089-12-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**] Chief Complaint: Anemia Multiple pulmonary nodules, sputum culture [**2160-3-12**] positive for AFB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: CT guided biopsy, abdominal mass, gallbladder fossa Esophagogastroduodenoscopy   History of Present Illness: 70yo Korean-speaking male with history of peri-ambullary pancreatic cancer s/p resection [**10-27**] (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] recently admitted [**Date range (1) 46889**] with symptomatic anemia attributed to probable chronic GI blood loss.
CT torso [**3-11**] notable for multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, including cavitary lesions involving RUL/LLL, multiple hypoattenuating liver lesions enlarged since [**10-27**], increased dilation of the visualized pancreatic duct; these findings were considered highly suspicious of metastatic pancreatic cancer.
As arranged by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**3-17**], pt underwent CT-guided biopsy of a soft-tissue mass in the gallbladder fossa earlier today, without reported complication.
Currently denies pain or significant discomfort.
Describes mild nausea without vomiting earlier today, now resolved.
Has had intermittent periumbilical discomfort over last several days.
Has been eating frequent small meals, endorses early satiety.
Notes dyspnea on exertion associated with mild light-headedness, brought on by activity such as taking a shower, but denies similar symptoms at rest.
Endorses mild cough with scant "mucous" production.
Denies recent fever, chills, lymph node swelling, or weight loss.
Review of systems otherwise negative in detail: denies headache, visual change, speech difficulties, sore throat, chest pain, palpitations, dysuria, focal numbness or weakness.
Has chronic left lower extremity discomfort s/p fall and injury in [**2137**].
Hypertension 2.
Hypercholesterolemia 3.
Papillary adenocarcinoma of ampulla of Vater, s/p transduodenal ampullary resection with reimplantation of pancreatic and biliary ducts and open cholecystectomy with open common bile duct exploration on [**2158-11-9**] 4.
H/o rib fracture 6.
Remote injury to left lower leg s/p fall in [**2137**]  Social History: Korean speaking.
Non smoker, No Drug use, No alcohol.
Physical Exam: T:98 / BP:122/70 / HR:98 / RR:18 / O2 sat: 97%RA GEN: Awake, alert, in NAD HEENT: Conjunctival pallor, anicteric sclerae, dry mucous membranes NECK: No JVP.
COR: S1 S2 RRR with I/VI systolic ejection murmur audible at base.
No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
LYMPH: No cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
NEURO: Speaking fluently in Korean with telephonic interpreter.
No pronator drift.
No pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
However, multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, with the largest in the left lower lobe measuring 2.2 x 1.5 cm.
Given history of pancreatic cancer, findings are most likely due to metastatic disease.
Cavitating nodules within the right lobe may also represent metastatic disease, although infectious etiologies remain in the differential.
Multiple hypoattenuating lesions within the liver which are increased in size since the previous study of [**2158-10-21**].
This is consistent with progression of metastatic disease.
Increased dilation of the visualized portion of the pancreatic duct.
Several hypodense liver lesions, some of which are new since [**2158-11-6**], likley represent benign lesions such as cysts and hemangiomas.
Enhancing soft tissue denisty lesion in the gallbladder fossa and omental nodule are concerning for metastases.
CT Head: FINDINGS: There is no acute hemorrhage, large areas of edema, large masses or mass effect.
There is no evidence of an acute vascular territorial infarct.
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are likely due to chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
A small area of hypodensity within the right basal ganglia is likely due from prior lacunar infarct.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
There was fresh blood and clots in the area but no definitive active bleeding.
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum .
Sputum, blood cx negative Blasto, B Glucan, , Aspergillus, Histo, Quantiferon negative  Brief Hospital Course: 70M korean speaking, h/o peri-ampular pancreatic ca s/p resection [**10-27**], presenting with recently symptomatic anemia concerning for GIB, cavitary pulmnonary lesions with AFB+ culture, admitted after elective CT guided biopsy with acute HCT drop.
# hypoxia / bradycardia / WCT - on [**2160-4-4**] PM, pt transferred to ICU in setting of hypoxia, bradycardia during EGD.
The event was attributed to hypoxia in the setting of a brief aspiration event.
He suffered no further events in house and was transferred to the medical floor in stable condition.
# acute blood loss anemia/GI Bleed - He received 2U PRBCs on the evening of admission with appropriate bump 19->25 [**3-31**].
On [**2160-4-4**], pt underwent EGD after 3rd AFB smear was negative for TB, which revealed a papillary mass with clotted blood.
The bleeding was presumed to be due to a small bleeding vessel related to his malignancy.
# AFB positive sputum culture / pulmonary nodules - concerning for mTB.
pt seen by opthalmology, with no evidence of color compromise, and recommendation for once monthly oupt f/u in [**Hospital 2081**] clinic while on TB meds to monitor vision.
given concern that pulmonary nodules likely do not represent TB, concern raised for other etiologies, particularly in light likely future chemotherapy for malignancy.
as such, serum sent for crptococcal ag, glucan, galactomanna, blasto, fungal cultures, and urine for histoplasma, which were negative.
consideration given to possible CT guided biopsy of lung lesions to confirm malignancy before therapy.
after discussion with his oncologist, this was felt not necessary from an oncologic perpsective, but would be deferred to ID.
# h/o Atrial tachycardia - during last admission, no recurrence.
# h/o ampullary cancer / liver nodules / pulmonary nodules - pathology of gallbladder fossa c/w recurrence of adenocarcinoma (pt and son [**Name (NI) **] aware).
as above, if pulmonary nodules not mTB, may need to consider other etiologies, particularly given likely plan for chemo per ID.
will hold off on additional testing until mTB probe testing done, if negative, may need bronch/ct guided biopsy of pulmonary nodules.
# hyperbilirubinemia - no RUQ TTP, s/p GB fossa biopsy, no fever, no other evidence of cholangitis prsently.
# COMM - [**Doctor First Name **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) **], korean translator 2-0050. .
TO DO: - Oncology evaluation for metastatic ampullary cancer - Check CBC to ensure stability of Hct.
If has recurrent GI bleed must consider INR embolization for bleeding vessel near ampullary cancer - Has MAC infection confirmed by MA state lab, NOT mTB.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a biopsy of an abdominal mass near the gallbladder.
You were also found to have anemia and given blood transfusion.
Endoscopy was performed which showed the cause of your anemia as gastrointestinal from a small vessel, which may be related to your canncer.
You were also found to have lung nodules, either from infection, bacteria, or due to cancer.
For your cancer you will need to see an oncologist as soon as possible to consider treatment.
For your bleed you must take an acid blocker twice daily and monitor for signs of bleeding.
For your noduless we recommend oncology and infectious disease follow up.
you will need to see an Infectious Disease doctor as soon as possible to discuss your lung nodules and potential infection with MAC and need for treatment
