Admission Date:  [**2198-1-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2198-2-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2133-2-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Adhesive Tape  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**] Chief Complaint: SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: vertebroplasty [**2198-2-1**] intubation [**2198-2-1**]   History of Present Illness: This is a 64 year-old M with ESRD on HD, HTN, obesity, CAD s/p stenting, HCV, metastatic poorly differentiated cancer (likely NSCLC) who presents with SOB.
He complained of SOB before HD today, which did not immediately improved post-dialysis, so he was sent to the ED.
No fever or chills.
Of note, he was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 58897**] with pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertension and dietary indiscretion.
He was given [**Date range (1) **] 325 mg. EKG was reportedly unchanged from baseline, CXR was without pulmonary edema or infiltrate.
Cardiac enzymes were sent with a troponin slightly above recent values (0.17 from 0.14 last week).
Currently reports feeling well, except for neck pain (no pain meds given since the a.m.).
He is on antibiotics for parotiditis and CDiff.
Developed neck pain and found to have C2 pathological fracture, [**11-22**] cytology demonstrated poorly differentiated carcinoma.
Per onc notes, is likely non-small cell lung carcinoma, with RML mass and metastasis to the cervical and sacral spine.
The only manifestation of his disease currently is cervical neck pain, s/p pathologic fx and posterior cervical arthrodesis C1-C3 and palliative XRT.
CAD s/p angioplasty D1 [**7-10**] and stents to OM2/3 in [**3-11**] #.
HTN #.
Thalassemia trait #.
Pathological C2 Fx s/p C1-3 Fusion #.
HCV - grade 1 inflammation and stage 0 fibrosis on bx [**2-9**]  Social History: lives with girlfriend, has 2 sons, used to work in construction, + smoker 1 PPD for many years quit recently, rare ETOH, no drugs.
Family History: Brother with CAD, and kidney disease requiring hemodialysis  Physical Exam: Vitals: T 97.0 BP 121/71 P 79 RR 20 SpO2 98% RA wt 169 lbs GEN: thin male sleeping, c/o neck pain when awoken.
Allowing for differences in technique, overall appearance is not much changed.
There is persistent right middle lobe consolidation, likely post-obstructive related to the known [**Location (un) 21851**] in this location.
No new focal consolidation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary vascular redistribution and blurring, improved since [**1-12**], with no overt edema or pleural effusion.
CT NECK [**11-19**]: 1  Enlarged right parotid gland and right parotid duct.
Tiny 1-2 mm stone within the proximal right parotid duct.
No definite obstructing distal ductal stones although evaluation of the most distal portion of the right parotid duct is limited by streak artifact from the patient's dental prosthesis.
Destructive lesion of C2 with associated pathologic fracture causes moderate central canal narrowing.
Several small cervical lymph nodes measure less than 1 cm in short axis and may be reactive.
Multiple small pulmonary nodules of the lung apices measure up to 9 mm at the right apex are not fully evaluated on this neck CT. 6.
Small nonocclusive left common femoral vein thrombus may be chronic.
No right-sided DVT.
CT HEAD WITH CONTRAST [**1-21**]: No hemorrhage or abnormal area of enhancement.
If there is high suspicion of metastatic lesion MRI is more sensitive.
No pulmonary embolism.
Right middle lobe spiculated mass with increased number and size of numerous pulmonary nodules, right hilar and  mediastinal lymphadenopathy, new right middle lobe bronchus encasement and obstruction as well as osseous metastasis (see below) all consistent with substantial progression of disease when compared to the CT of [**2197-12-24**].
New acute pathologic compression fracture involving the T4 vertebral body and lytic lesion involving the transverse process of the T4 vertebral body.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Extensive paraseptal and centrilobular emphysematous disease.
[**Date Range **] [**1-23**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2197-12-4**], the left ventricle is now more dilated, left ventricular systolic function is now more depressed and mitral regurgitation is now more prominent.
Regional wall motion abnormalities are similar.
[**2198-1-24**] MRI THORACIC SPINE: IMPRESSION: Signal hyperintensity in T4 vertebral body and right transverse process, consistent with known metastasis.
No epidural disease is seen, however it cannot be completely excluded due to the non-diagnostic axial images.
[**2198-2-6**] MRI CERVICAL SPINE: CONCLUSION: Limited study due to the lack of intravenous contrast and due to artifacts arising from the fusion hardware.
There is angulation and kyphosis with its apex at C2.
This, in addition to tumor breaking through the posterior margin of the vertebral body produces narrowing of the spinal canal, but not spinal cord compression.
There is extensive paravertebral tumor spread at the C2 level.
There appears to be a second tumor deposit in the C3-C4 neural foramen.
Fracture of the left lateral mass of C1 just lateral to the screw.
Necrotic level II lymph nodes posterior to and causing slight compression of left IJ vein.
[**2198-2-13**] EMG: IMPRESSION: Abnormal study.
There is electrophysiologic evidence for a moderately severe, subacute (between 3 weeks and 3 months) C5 radiculopathy on the left.
There is also evidence for an underlying mild, generalized, sensorimotor polyneuropathy with axonal features.
The findings are less consistent with a disorder of the brachial plexus on the left.
PATHOLOGY: [**2198-2-1**] T4 VERTEBRAL BODY, biopsy: Predominantly blood with rare degenerated malignant cells, consistent with poorly differentiated metastatic carcinoma; see note.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 64 year-old M with ESRD on HD, HTN, CAD s/p stenting, HCV, recent C. diff infection, and metastatic poorly differentiated cancer (likely NSCLC) who presented with SOB that resolved, whose hospital course was complicated by lower extremity DVT and new T4 compression fracture.
METASTATIC NON SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER/ VERTEBRAL METASTASES: The patient has a history of NSCLC diagnosed in [**12-11**] pre-renal transplant.
He developed neck pain and was found to have a pathologic fracture of C2 with posterior cervical arthrodesis in [**11-11**].
Cytology demonstrated poorly differentiated carcinoma and per oncology notes the likely diagnosis is non-small cell lung cancer.
He also has known mets to the sacral spine and upon this admission noted to have a thoracic (T4) pathologic fracture which was successfully treated with vertebroplasty on [**2198-2-1**].
Post-operative course was complicated by volume overload secondary to intra-operative IVF administration that resulted in brief intubation and ICU transfer.
The patient continued to complain of neck pain after the procedure.
The patient was evalauted by spinal surgery, who recommended no further operative measures as the patient is a poor surgical candidate given poor prognosis, multiple comorbidities, and morbidity of procedure.
The patient also complained of progressive LUE weakness since [**11-11**], which was felt to be most likely secondary to findings of a new paraspinal soft tissue mass and tumor deposition at C4-5 neural foramen.
Radiculopathy in this distribution was confirmed by EMG testing.
The patient received navelbine for chemotherapy on [**2-6**] which was well-tolerated, but given findings of progressive metastatic disease despite chemo/ XRT it was decided that further chemotherapy would not be pursued.
SHORTNESS OF BREATH: The patient initially initially thought to be volume overload; however, the patient was only mildly volume overloaded.
He was dialyzed without much improvment but then upon admission his shortness of breath resolved without further intervention.
Given his metastatic lung cancer it was thought possibly due to the progression of his disease.
In addition the patient had a small non-occlusive, possibly chronic DVT and a thought was possible small PEs, this was not evident on CTA.
FEVER: On [**2-9**] the patient developed fevers to 101.7 with no localizing signs or symptoms.
There was no evidence of cellulitis or abscess on exam.
There was no jaw pain or exam findings to suggest parotiditis.
Possibility of tumor fevers was considered, but there was no prior history of this.
The patient was started on levofloxacin, vancomycin (with HD), and briefly flagyl for broad coverage.
DVT: As above, the patient was found to have a small non-occlusive, possibly chronic DVT in the left common femoral vein.
CAD: The patient had multiple episodes of chest pain during admission.
He was ruled out for MI several times with negative cardiac enzymes and no ischemic EKG changes.
PAROTITIS: stone passage 1 week prior to admission, repeat CT scan showed a small, 1-2mm stone in stentsons duct without obstruction.
Vanc and Levofloxacin were stopped in discussion with ENT and the patient was continued on Flagyl for his C diff.
C DIFF COLITIS: patient with a history of C diff colitis, on flagyl; however, in light of recent antibiotic administration for parotitis, flagyl was continued for an additional 14 day course after completion of vanc/ levo.
The patient was discharged on [**2198-2-16**] to home in stable condition, afebrile and VSS, with services.
