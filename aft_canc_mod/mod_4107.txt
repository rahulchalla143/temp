He was initially diagnosed with a thoracic gangliogliom /resected in [**2194**].
He had back pain in [**2-26**], seen at [**Company 2860**], and was found to have mets to brain and spine.
MRI 3 months after this ([**2196-2-23**]) showed some enhancement along spine at C2, mid thoracic, and sacral lesion, consistent with metastatic disease.
MRI brain was neg for disease, and cytology on LP was negative.
Most recent MRI showed new left frontal lobe lesion among other mets.
The weekend prior to admission, he had intermittent episodes of somnolence interrupted by completely lucid/alert moments.
Antibiotics were initially administered for ?meningitis (LP not performed), and it was felt that no emergent treatment was needed at this time.
Upon transfer to the floor, his mental status was improved but still not at baseline; he was still somnolent, drowsy, but with no new weakness, tingling, neurologic deficits.
He denies fevers/chills/stiff neck/photophobia/new urinary or bowel symptoms.
Primitive Neuroectodermal tumor with mets to brain and spine, dx [**2-26**], s/p radiation, chemo; currently was on thalidomide; most recently on temozolomide/oral etoposide.

Delta MS: was likely in setting of oversedation from medications.
His mental status improved after Narcan, was started empirically on broad spectrum antibiotics for ?meningitis; these were stopped, however, as he has no obvious signs of meningitis.
All sedating meds continued to be held, and he was discharged just on dilaudid for pain control.
No worsening on MRI, no herniation or midline shift.
He had visual field cuts that were possibly new, but his neurologic exam remained stable while in-house.
Decadron was continued for possible cerebral edema.
Pancytopenia: likely related to chemotherapy, received 1  U PRBC in MICU, no signs of active bleeding.
Dispo: He was discharged to home, to continue on Dilaudid for pain control.
