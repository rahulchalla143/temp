notes that over the past 1 month, he has had persistent anorexia, generalized fatigue and weight loss (amount unknown).
He notes that over the past 2 weeks, he has had intermittent loose stools ([**2-14**]/day).
he also noted increaseing swelling and erythema of his RLE after scrathcing his leg.
He noted to have increasing amounts of weeping.
Although he has severe neuropathy and usually does not feel the skin on LEs, as of last week, RLE became painful.
Also of note, he has had increasing SOB, especially DOE over the past 6 weeks.
During that hospitalization was noted to have n/v, fevers and "decreased oxygen levels."
He has been to and from the [**Hospital3 **] on nearly a monthly basis for SOB, recurrent falls (due to hypoglycemia).
No focal weakness noted.
Because of all of the above symptoms and signs, his daughter decided to send him to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Name (NI) **], as they were not happy with care at [**Hospital3 **].
Was felt to have a RLE cellulitis and crackles bilaterally.
Head CT was negative for acute process.
While in ED awaiting a floor bed, became acutely hypoxic to the 70s, looked pale, placed on NRB.
EKG showed new lateral lead ST depressions and an old R bundle.
CXR showed R sided effusion.
Review of systems:  (+) Per HPI, weight loss, non-productive cough since [**Month (only) **], SOB as above, diarrhea and weakness.
Denies arthralgias or myalgias   Past Medical History: - Type 2 diabetes - complicated by nephropathy, neuropathy, diabetic foot and previous admission for hypoglycemia - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Chronic renal insufficiency - baseline creatinine 1.6, last Cr.
- Benign prostatic hypertrophy - Hematuria s/p cystoscopy in [**2144**] - Alcohol dependence - no history of withdrawal seizures or DT - Alcoholic pancreatitis - Bilateral lower extremity DVT diagnosed [**8-/2146**] - Atrial Fibrillation dx [**2-20**] - Diastolic heart failure - Normocytic anemia - Multiple Polyps removed.
He has two brothers and three sisters among whom there is a history of diabetes, hypertension, stroke but no history of kidney disease.
IMAGING: Abdominal U/S [**2148-8-1**]: Multiple confluent masses largely replacing the left lobe and caudate.
There is resultant peripheral biliary dilatation related to duct obstruction from the mass as well as thrombosis of the left portal vein.
In addition, there is focal non-occlusive thrombus involving the right posterior portal vein and IVC.
The findings are most suggestive of either hepatocellular carcinoma or peripheral cholangiocarcinoma.
The left lobe lesions could be targeted via percutaneous biopsy once the patient's coagulation parameters have been corrected.
Bilateral simple renal cysts.
No cholelithiasis; no specific evidence for acute cholecystitis.
No stone, hydronephrosis, or solid mass is seen in the kidneys.
No perinephric fluid is noted.
Chest xray [**2148-8-8**]: SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST REASON FOR EXAM: Metastatic HCC, known right pleural effusion with increasing shortness of breath.
Large right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis has worsened.
Pulmonary edema has improved.
There is no evident pneumothorax or left pleural effusion.

Pager#[**Serial Number 24741**]   Brief Hospital Course: *This patient passed away on [**8-12**]* Mr. [**Known lastname 24413**] is a 73 yo M with multiple medical problems including DM II (admissions for hypoglycemia), HTN, HL, DVTs and afib on coumadin, dCHF, CKD (Cr 2.2), EtOH abuse, who recently presented [**2148-7-29**] to [**Hospital1 18**] after having a mechanical fall in the setting of new persistent anorexia, generalized fatigue, weight loss (unknwon amount), and RLE cellulitis and was admitted to the MICU after becoming hypoxic to the 70s in the ED and needing to be placed on nonrebreather.
Pt passed away [**8-12**] w/o intervention in the presence of family and pastoral care.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure.
He was found to have a right pleural effusion on CXR with findings concerning for HAP.
Following thoracentesis, on [**8-2**] his respiratory staus decompensated and he again had an increased oxygen requirement.
Mr. [**Known lastname 24413**] was found to have signifcant pulmonary edema on CXR and a renal consult was obtained to help guide diuresis.
Thoracentesis performed in MICU showed Labs were consistent with transudative effusion: serum Protein ratio 0.45, LDH ratio 0.43, 375 WBC, pH 7.42.
Cytology negative for malignant cells.
Incidentally discovered liver masses on RUQ u/s (marked alk phos elevation).
Sono also positive for portal vein thrombosis and IVC thrombus suggestive of either an infiltrative hepatocellular carcinoma or peripheral cholangiocarcinoma.
Serologies negative for HCV, HBV, but AFP was elevated at [**Numeric Identifier 24742**].
Recurrent pleural effusions attributed to metastases from liver primary ca.
Renal consulted.
Called [**8-7**] for SOB but quickly returned to baseline.
# Palliative Care/End of life issues: Mr. [**Known lastname 24413**] was found to have liver malignancy likely HCC with metastases.
Pt schedule for placement of palliative pleurx catheter for recurrent R sided effusions.
# Abdominal distension.
Mr. [**Known lastname 24413**] was found to have significant abdominal distention.
Serial exams did not indicate an acute intraabdominal process.
An abdominal U/S on [**8-1**] demonstrated liver masses, which in the setting of cirrhosis and transaminitis with AFP of >14,000 is particularly concerning for HCC.
A CT biopsy was delayed because of his coagulopathy with a climbing INR of 3.2 likely [**2-13**] liver dysfunction.
In addition, an abdominal MRI was also delayed becuase of his tenuous renal function with a climbing Cr of 4.1. .
Per their recs, a biopsy was not necessarily needed to diagnose HCC in this gentleman with known cirrhosis and AFP of 15,000.
Currently denies any abd discomfort, feelings of constipation or pressure or difficulty breathing.
# Cellulitis: Mr. [**Known lastname 24413**] was continued on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin as above.
Discontinued in MICU after diagnosis of malignant hepatic process and non-infectious pleural effusion.
He continued to be afebrile, but had an elevated white count to 11.9 on [**8-7**].
# Acute on chronic renal failure: During his ICU stay, his serum creatinine began to climb from his baseline of 2.2, up to 4.0.
Of note, prior to his transfer to the ICU, he had received one dose of albumin on the medicine floors, but had not had a true albumin challenge.
The ICU team attempted diuresis with IV lasix and metolazone; however, he remained net positive during his MICU stay.
He was maintained on fluid restriction to 1200ml, low phos, low sodium diet.
# Hypervolemic hyponatremia: FeNa<1%, likely secondary to known cirrhosis, and renal failure.
# Atrial fibrillation: During his admission, his coumadin was held given a  supratherapeutic INR likely [**2-13**] hepatic failure.
He was started on metoprolol 12.5mg qid for rate control and increased dose to 37.5mg for palliation of pulmo edema and SOB.
# DVTs: He was started on heparin gtt, and his home coumadin was held because of a supratherapeutic INR.
The heparin was discontinued on [**2148-8-5**], given elevated INR of 3.2. .
# DM II.
Pt has history of hypoglycemia necessitating hospitalization.
# HTN.
He was continued on his home dose of simvastatin initially, and was discontinued after transfer from MICU to medicine floors with goal of care for short term, comfort and palliation.
# Iron deficiency anemia: His hct remained stable, with no s/s of bleeding.
# CHF.
Elevated BNP suggesting CHF decompensation.
