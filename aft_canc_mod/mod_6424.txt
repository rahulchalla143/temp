This was initially diagnosed during routine imaging follow-up for renal cell carcinoma of her right kidney which is now status post RFA.
She has had prior imaging from [**Hospital6 2561**] dating back to [**2182**] that showed a liver lesion of 2.3 cm.
Most recently, a CT scan and PET scan both demonstrated enlargement of the liver lesion to greater than 9 cm.
A biopsy demonstrated hepatocellular carcinoma.
The kidney lesion has been noted to be stable.
A CT scan of the chest demonstrated no evidence of pulmonary metastases.
A triphasic CT scan demonstrated a large arterial and hyper-enhancing mass involving segments 5 and 6 of the liver consistent with a biopsy-proven HCC with no further concerning lesions being identified.
She has undergone thorough preoperative evaluation of her cardiac and cerebrovascular vasculature and has been cleared for surgery.
Past Medical History: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and had a heart attack in [**2165**].
Peripheral vascular disease s/p R external iliac stent and angioplasty.
Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression, osteoarthritis, anemia, cataracts, 3 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm, vulvar cancer, R renal cell cancer s/p radiofrequency ablation.
Family History: Mother died of SBO, father died of cerebral hemorrhage, sister died of leukemia, sister with bladder cancer, brother with prostate cancer  Physical Exam: Post-op exam: T 98.3 HR 71, BP 119/51, RR 18, SpO2 98% gen: sedated, difficult to arouse, opens eyes to painful stimuli but not voice, intubated cardiac: RRR chest: CTAB, upper airway sounds abd: decreased breath sounds, mildly distended, clean dressings, sanguinous drainage in JP GU: Foley, urine concentrated ext: warm and well-perfused, decreased pedal pulses  Pertinent Results: [**2184-12-10**] 11:52AM BLOOD WBC-3.1*# RBC-3.77* Hgb-9.9* Hct-30.1* MCV-80* MCH-26.2* MCHC-32.9 RDW-16.3* Plt Ct-120* [**2184-12-11**] 04:28AM BLOOD WBC-9.0# RBC-4.58 Hgb-12.8 Hct-37.2 MCV-81* MCH-28.0 MCHC-34.5 RDW-16.1* Plt Ct-92* [**2184-12-13**] 04:57AM BLOOD WBC-13.0* RBC-5.22 Hgb-14.3 Hct-43.5 MCV-83 MCH-27.4 MCHC-32.9 RDW-16.7* Plt Ct-76* [**2184-12-16**] 04:50AM BLOOD PT-17.3* INR(PT)-1.5* [**2184-12-16**] 04:50AM BLOOD Glucose-54* UreaN-24* Creat-0.8 Na-133 K-4.1 Cl-100 HCO3-26 AnGap-11  [**2184-12-10**] intraoperative liver U/S: Large right lobe liver mass which is lobulated in contour but appears to be solitary.
[**2184-12-11**] liver U/S: No large fluid collections are seen.
The liver demonstrates moderate dropout of signal intensity on out-of-phase imaging consistent with fatty infiltration.
There is no evidence of other worrisome lesions.
There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Small amount of perihepatic fluid is noted, without evidence of organized fluid collection.
Extensive perihepatic hematoma with mass effect upon the liver, portal vein and stomach.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Severe hepatocellular and canalicular cholestasis, primarily involving zone 3 with prominent hepatocellular swelling.
Mild lobular and focal portal neutrophilic infiltration with neutrophilic aggregates and infiltration of bile ducts.
No bile duct proliferation is seen.
Mild to focally moderate steatosis (not seen on previous resection).
[**2184-12-24**] CXR:  Interval increase in bilateral right greater than left small pleural effusions with associated atelectasis without evidence of pneumonia.
[**2184-12-30**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph from [**12-25**], there is improvement with decrease in extent of the right-sided pleural effusion.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
No biliary dilatation and appropriate vascular waveforms seen in the left lobe of the liver.
Right pleural effusion.
[**2184-12-30**] LE U/S: No lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
Please refer to operative note for complete details.
Postop, patient was transferred intubated to the PACU due to episodes of apnea on CPAP accompanied by respiratory acidosis, likely related to the earlier administration of intrathecal morphine.
For this reason, an MRCP was obtained on [**2184-12-17**] that demonstrated no biliary obstruction.
Sanguinous output was noted from JP.
A Dobhoff was placed and tube feeds were started for poor oral intake.
On [**12-23**] L blood was noted from JP drain with a decline in HCT to 28.9 from prior 32.8 and was taken to OR for hematoma evacuation.
Hematoma was observed but no active bleeding was identified.
Patient was kept in SICU following surgery for monitoring.
She had an episode of delerium treated with Seroquel.
Liver biopsy obtained intra-operatively demonstrated severe cholestasis.
Cultures obtained from the hematoma intra-op grew sparse coag neg staph aureus.
On [**12-25**] she was hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the floor, but still had confused mental status despite withholding of sedating medications.
On [**12-27**] 1 FFP, 1 plt, and vitamin K were given for an INR of 2.1, but there was no evidence of bleeding from the JP drains, which had decreased output.
On [**12-29**] dermatology was consulted for a worsening rash over her flanks and lower abdomen and suggested a drug reaction versus contact dermatitis.
That afternoon, she was noted to have worsening mental status and complaint of shortness of breath for which albuterol nebs were given.
Chest xray demonstrated right greater than left pleural effusion but mild vascular congestion.
The morning of [**12-30**] patient was transferred to the SICU for increased confusion and tachypnea with concern over airway protection.
Massive transfusion protocol was initiated and patient underwent exploratory laparotomy at bedside by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], but bleeding was unable to be controlled and patient required CPR and external pacing.
