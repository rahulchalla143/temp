CXR: Inspiratory and expiratory views demonstrate a small apical  pneumothorax and are otherwise stable compared with 14:53 hrs.
ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
At least moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No LVOT obstruction.
CXR: There is a tiny left apical pneumothorax.
Left pleural effusion has almost completely resolved.
Multiple left-sided rib fractures appear unchanged.
There is a new left-sided chest tube.
Left lower lobe atelectasis has improved.
CXR: Tiny left apical pneumothorax, stable-appearing.
Near resolution of left pleural effusion.
Possible loculated left extrapleural fluid collection.
Heavily calcified hard plaque in both carotid bulbs and internal carotids without evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis (less than 40% bilaterally).
Vascularized soft tissue mass between the right ICA and CCA is consistent with a carotid body tumor.
Contiguous, segmental fractures of the left fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh ribs, suggestive of flail chest.
Predominantly extrapleural high-density material surrounding these fracture sites consistent with extrapleural hematomas.
Moderately large left pleural effusion with high density inferiorly, which may indicate a component of hemothorax.
Adjacent relaxation atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
Undisplaced fracture of the tip of the scapula.
Multiple pulmonary nodules as described, the largest in the right upper lobe measuring approximately 1 cm.
While this nodule has some features suspicious for malignancy, atypical infections including TB or other granulomatous disease can have a similar appearance.
Therefore, a repeat CT in six weeks is recommended to assess stability or resolution.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 80F who was admitted for management of posterior 4th-7th rib fractures.
She was admitted to the ICU for monitoring initially.
She was doing well but was noted to have a new left hemoTX on CXR [**2198-3-27**].
Carotid series revealed a possible carotid body tumor.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
7. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
