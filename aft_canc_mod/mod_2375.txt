He was at routine clinic visit on [**2-4**] and noted shortness of breath and sats 93% RA.
He had had recent outpatient treatment for pneumonia starting [**1-21**], briefly interrupted due to elevated bilirubin.
Pulmonary was consulted and recommended chest PT and hypertonic saline.
Afebrile with exception of T100.5 on [**2-9**] and 100.3 this morning.
IL-2 was stopped at admission and tacrolimus was trialed for enhanced immunosuppresion, but was stopped today due to development of tremor in the past few days.
On rounds this AM he noted fatigue without new respiratory symptoms.
Immediately prior to intubation he was apneic and required bag ventilation.
Notables include significant weight loss for which GI was consulted, and development of bilateral LE edema (as well as some in UEs).
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: - [**4-/2154**] p/w fevers, night sweats, and weight loss in the setting of a left inguinal lymph node.
- Treated with six cycles of CHOP/Rituxan with good response, but showed evidence for relapse in [**12/2154**] and was treated with MINE chemotherapy for two cycles.
- Multiple GI bleeds requiring ICU admissions and multiple transfusions and embolization of his bleeding.
- Noted to have CNS lesions felt consistent with PTLD and this was treated with a course of Rituxan.
No evidence for recurrence of the PTLD.
- Acute liver GVHD, on CellCept, prednisone, and photophoresis.
- [**2157-12-28**] Photophoresis was d/c'd due to episodes of bacteremia and eventual removal of his apheresis catheter.
- [**2158-6-13**] restarted photopheresis on a weekly basis on , but then discontinued this again on [**2158-9-7**] as this was felt not to be making any impact on his liver function tests.
- undergone phlebotomy due to iron overload with corresponding drop in his ferritin.
He has continued with transient rises in his transaminases and bilirubin and has remained on varying doses of CellCept and prednisone which has been slowly tapered over the time.
- [**2159-1-19**] admission due to increasing right hip pain.
MRI revealed edema and infiltrating process in the psoas muscle bilaterally.
After extensive workup, this was felt related to an infection and required several admissions with completion of antibiotics in 03/[**2158**].
- [**7-/2160**]: Last scans showed no evidence for lymphom and he has remained in remission.
-In [**5-/2161**], noted to have tiny echogenic nodule on abdominal [**Year (4 digits) 950**].
MRI of the liver also showed this nodule but was not as concerning on review and he is due to have a repeat MRI imaging in early [**Month (only) **].
-On [**2161-8-3**], worsening cough and was noted to have a small new pneumothorax in the left apical area.
This has essentially resolved over time - Issues with weight loss (followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]); multiple tests done with no etiology found; question malabsorption related to GVHD - Has on and off respiratory infections and has been treated with antibiotics with possible pneumonia.
Question underlying exacerbations of pulmonary GVHD in setting of his URIs.

# Hypercarbic respiratory failure.
The etiology of his respiratory failure was thought to be most likely [**1-26**] 3 factors: 1) worsening pulmonary GVHD 2) cirrhosis also likely [**1-26**] GVHD and may benefit from a therapeutic para to help his breathing 3) low negative inspiratory force (NIF) values, suggestive of weak muscles of respiration, possibly secondary to ICU or steroid myopathy.
After discussion with his oncologist and the primary medical team, CT surgery was consulted for tracheostomy and GI was consulted about placing a PEG tube.
He intermittently required NIPPV for respiratory fatigue but in general his ABGs were reassuring enough for him to remain on oxygen supplementation alone.
On [**2-28**], the patient appeared to be in respiratory fatigue which continued and worsened with increasing tachycardia in the setting of pt spiking fevers.
He was kept on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage and was switched to Meropenem when BAL cultures showed Klebsiella pneumoniae sensitive to this antibiotic.
The patient was noted to have increasing leukocytosis and low grade temps on [**2162-3-2**].
The results of the CT sinus and CT chest were consistent with marked interval worsening of right lower lobe pneumonia.. Culture data from BAL was consistent with meropenem-sensitive klebsiella pneumonia.
He did have a low grade fever to 100.5F on [**3-10**].
C. difficile toxin was negative x 2, and vancomycin was stopped on [**2162-3-12**], with no further fevers.
Mr. [**Known lastname 38598**] reported frequent loose stools on [**3-11**].
# Hypotension.
Normotensive prior to intubation but had some prolonged low BPs most likely secondary to positive pressure effects and sedation.
# Edema.
A TTE on this admission was similarly normal, but his symptoms did self-resolve.
[**Month (only) 116**] have been related to cirrhosis although albumin only 3.6. .
# Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p allo [**Month (only) 3242**]: Most recent PET scan with no evidence of recurrent disease and he remains in remission.
# GVHD.
# Elevated LFTs.
# Hypothyroidism.
No active issues.
# Gastric varices.
No e/o GI bleed.
A Dobhoff was placed by IR on [**3-10**] as patient was unable to keep up with adequate po intake for caloric needs.
