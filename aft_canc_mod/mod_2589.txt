Studies: CT L-spine ([**10-19**]): No obvious evidence for discitis/osteomyelitis or epidural collection, though evaluation is limited by CT technique.
Interval improvement of previously seen ground glass and peribronchiolar opacities.
No focal consolidation.
No evidence of bacterial or fungal pneumonia on the current study.
Decreasing small bilateral pleural effusions.
Splenomegaly and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy again identified.
CXR ([**10-23**]): Persistent asymmetrical pulmonary opacities, for which differential diagnosis includes asymmetrical pulmonary edema, infection such as PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] hemorrhage, and drug toxicity.
New clustered peribronchovascular and peribronchiolar nodules in the right upper lobe and less marked in the left upper lobe, suggesting endobronchial spread of infection.
Diffuse heterogeneous attenuation and widespread air trapping is more marked than on [**10-19**], probably related to acute infectious process and small airway disease.
Rapid progression makes bronchiolitis obliterans very less likely.
No volume overload.
No pleural effusion.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
([**11-3**])No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Brief Hospital Course: 53 M d 338 s/p allo SCT presented on [**10-18**] with fever and diffuse pain, then hypoxic repiratory failure, found to have stentotrophomonas bacteremia.
On [**10-18**], he was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory distress.
The evening of [**10-19**], a code blue was called for acute respiratory distress 30 minutes after Hickman was flushed.
At the time, he had wheezing, RR > 40, coughing, agitated, he was hypertensive and tachycardic.
He had a depressed mental status and was not responding commands.
Patient felt acutely short of breath- this was preceeded by rigors.
no chest pain.
No hemoptysis.
+ nausea, no vomiting.
He did have chills / rigors that were witnessed during his "code blue."
An echo showed no vegitations but global hypokenesis.
STENOTROPHOMONAS BACTEREMIA - Following admission to the floor, he remained afebrile, without leukocytosis, with no indwelling lines.
Bactrim was stopped on [**11-1**] for hyperkalemia with mild T-wave changes, at which point he had completed a 12 day course.
HYPOXEMIA- His oxygen requirement improved from 5L NC on transfer to the floor to his baseline of 1.5L at rest and 3L with activity.
The original elevation was thought to be related to volume overload vs mild ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **] from bacteremia.
He was continued on gentle diuresis home dose lasix, goal 0-1 L per day, but this was stopped on [**10-28**] given elevated creatinine.
A CT with contrast showed a new cluster of peribronchovascular and peribronchiolar nodules, concerning for infection.
Pulmonary was consulted, who had seen him as an outpatient, and felt his respiratory issues to be chronic.
Given concern for pulmonary hypertension, a bubble study was done, showing no evedence of cardiac shunt.
MENTAL STATUS CHANGES - Per nursing and patient, he has had some mild decine in short-term memory and occasionally will lose track of what people are saying.
Mental status and neurological exams were normal.
An MRI was ordered to assess for change in mental status.
MRI/MRA showed only mild brain atrophy, but no evidence of infarct or signs of acute or chronic ischemia.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE - Creatinine rose steadily on IV bactrim, lasix, lisinopril.
Renal consult team felt that the increased creatinine was due to the benign effect of bactrim on inhibiting tubular secretion of creatinine that would resolve following discontinuation of treatment.
ACUTE MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA, history of STEM CELL TRANSPLANT - Daily CBCs with differential showed his disease to be in remission.
INGROWN TOENAILS - Patient with chronic ingrown toenails, missed podietry appointment secondary to hospital stay.
On [**11-3**] developed new toe redness and bloody pirulent discharge.
He did not require lasix to maintain volume status and this was held while his creatinine was elevated and there were no exam findings of volume overload.
** Consider follow-up echo to look for resolution of depressed ejection fraction .
HYPERTENSION - In the ICU, he was restarted on carvedilol and recently restarted on his ACE.
His ace was subsequently held for elevated creatinine ** consider restarting ACE if Cr stable.. .
BLURRY VISION - Patient had blurry vision on this and previous admission that was associated with early sepsis.
These vision changes resolved quickly both times with resussitation, but he notes his lens prescription is out of date.
