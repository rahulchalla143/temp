She then had a LOC and episode of syncope (witnessed by husband) for approximately 4 minutes.
No incontinence.
No evidence of seizure activity per husband.
She regained consciouness and felt fine afterwards.
She also has a known RLE DVT and is on Coumadin.
She was also given Zofran for nausea x 1, dilaudid for pain, and vancomycin/levofloxacin/flagyl for a presumed infection.
Bedside TTE revealed no evidence of pericardial effusion.
She was c/o right LE pain and she had a CT which was negative.
Upon arrival to the ICU, she was normotensive and had an episode of nausea and vomiting, 300 mL of undigested food.
No CP or SOB.
No urinary or bowel complaints.
No palpitations.
No orthopnea or PND.
No LE edema.
Past Medical History: Prior Onc Hx: In [**2133**] pt had a mass noted in her R breast and she underwent mastectomy.
In [**7-28**] she developed metastatic disease with rising tumor markers.
In [**1-29**] CT head showed multiple areas of cerebral calcifications--however pt .
In [**2-27**] repeat CT of torso showed regression of all of her mets and she had decreased tumor markers.
She is now receiving weekly Taxol which was restarted in [**3-29**] after Taxol/Avastin had been held for fatigue and CHF.
TTE [**2142-2-16**]: There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
3. osteoarthritis 4. lymphedema right arm  Social History: No tobacco or illicit drug use.
Family History: Father died of rectal cancer.
?F) HR: 77 (77 - 83) bpm BP: 106/81(87){103/54(66) - 106/81(87)} mmHg RR: 19 (18 - 19) insp/min SpO2: 97% General Appearance: Well nourished, No acute distress, Overweight / Obese Eyes / Conjunctiva: PERRL Head, Ears, Nose, Throat: Normocephalic Lymphatic: Cervical WNL, Supraclavicular WNL Cardiovascular: (PMI Normal), (S1: Normal), (S2: Normal), (Murmur: Systolic), RUSB Peripheral Vascular:  (Right DP pulse: Present), (Left DP pulse: Present) Respiratory / Chest: (Expansion: Symmetric), (Breath Sounds: Clear : ) Abdominal: Soft, Non-tender, Bowel sounds present, Obese Extremities: Right: Trace, Left: Trace Neurologic: Attentive, Follows simple commands, Oriented (to): person, place, and time, Tone: Normal, [**3-28**] RUE, [**4-27**] left   Pertinent Results: CXR [**2144-1-31**] No acute cardiopulmonary disease.
Intraluminal thrombus starting from the distal common femoral vein extending throughout the superficial femoral vein and into the popliteal vein.
Right hip films No acute pathology, prelim read.
CT Abdomen and Pelvis No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Improving left lingular opacity representing either infectious or inflammatory etiology.
Non-visualized liver lesions, likely due to differences in phase of contrast.
EKG: NSR at 71, LAD, LBBB, no acute ST changes.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2144-2-3**] at 3:30:00 PM The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior septum, inferior wall and inferolateral wall.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
No pathologic valvular abnormality or significant outflow tract gradient seen.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The prior echo reported global mild hypokinesis, however the inferior and inferolateral segments appeared to have worse function at that time also.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 73 y/o female with metastatic breast ca (bone, liver, lungs, CNS) who p/w weakness and was found to have transient hypotension, initally admitted to the ICU for further evaluation of hypotension, then transferred to the Oncology service for further monitoring.
# Hypotension - Transient and resolved prior to admission to ICU.
Other considerations included infection (though no symptoms & no data while inpatient) or cardiac source.
Ruled-out for myocardial infarction.
No arrhythmia on telemetry.
TTE was additionally obtained given her history of known cardiomyopathy and low EF.
# Leukocytosis - No signs or symptoms of infection during stay.
CXR without evidence of infection.
Thus, likely secondary to Neupogen.
# Syncope - Upon transfer to the Oncology service had effectively been ruled-out for PE, infection and MI.
[**Month (only) 116**] have had mild dehydration though she denies decreased po intake prior to event.
Seizure unlikely though no EEG performed.
No new neurological deficits concerning for TIA.
Arrhythmia possible, but none seen while on telemetry in ICU.
ECHO nondiagnostic for new abnormaliity.
Given history and other negative work-up, her syncope is most consistent with a vasovagal response.
# Metastatic breast CA - Currently being treated with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Resultant leukocytosis as above.
# Anemia - Chronic, likely [**1-25**] anemia of chronic disease.
# RLE DVT - On Coumadin as an outpatient.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Hypotension NOS Metastatic breast cancer   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with hypotension.
A full workup has been performed, and no clear source for your low blood pressure was discovered.
If you develop dizziness, weakness, fainting, fever, chills, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please seek medical attention immediately.
