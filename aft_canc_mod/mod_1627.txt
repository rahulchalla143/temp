Pertinent Results:                 MCV 87 6.3\10.5/384    /31.3\  N:75.5 L:14.4 M:8.1 E:1.7 Bas:0.3 Hypochr: 1+  139 | 101|   5/116    AGap=16 3.4 | 25 | 0.6\  Ca: 9.2 Mg: 1.6 P: 2.7 ALT: 96 AP: 87 Tbili: 0.3 Alb: 3.8 AST: 90 LDH: 250 Dbili:  TProt: [**Doctor First Name **]: 87 Lip: 77  CT: [**2107-5-17**] IMPRESSION: 1)  Significant progression of the disease with new hepatic lesions, enlargement of retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy, and ascites.
These findings are consistent with progression of metastatic ovarian carcinoma.
Although, no obvious mass is noted in the right lower quadrant, metastatic disease causing mild obstruction is not entirely excluded.
Correlation with clinical symptoms is recommended.
If necessary, a small bowel follow through could be performed.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 53 year old woman with metastatic ovarian cancer presents from OSH with partial SBO.
However, she remained distended and required surgical intervention.
Given that she presented several weeks ago with BRBPR this is very concerning for progression of her disease and possible erosion into the bowel.
2) Low grade fever: Pt had fevers recurrently throughout the course of her hospital stay, and had a positive culture in the urine which cleared after appropriate antibiotic therapy.
Nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: 5-10 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for thrush.
