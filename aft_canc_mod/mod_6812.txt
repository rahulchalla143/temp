Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL SUMMARY: 71 year old female PMHx Breast cancer s/p bilateral mastectomy who presented w SOB, found to have pericardial effusion with tamponade, s/p pericardial window, also with L pleural effusion s/p pleurex placement, both cytology samples returning positive for adenocarcinoma, course complicated by hypoxia thought to be secondary to cancer lymphangitic pulmonary burden, now s/p initiation of taxol.
# Pericardial effusion: On admission, found to have effusion with tamponade physiology; s/p drainage of pericardial effusion on [**2112-4-3**] complicated by RV puncture and transient need for levophed (~3 minutes).
Final cytology report with malignant cells consistent with breast adenocarcinoma.
# Atrial Fibrillation - First noted following pericardial window, felt to be secondary to pericardial irritation; no evidence of PE on CTA chest (although not protocoled for PE).
# Pleural Effusions - During hospital stay, noted to have enlarging R pleural effusion, on [**4-8**] underwent tap, with conversion to pleurex on [**4-11**].
Final cytology report with malignant cells consistent with breast adenocarcinoma.
# RUE DVT: In setting of RUE edema, RUE ultrasound demonstrated nonocclusive clot around R PICC line; after discussion w primary oncologist, patient was started on therapeutic lovenox (planned duration = lifelong given ongoing onc issues)  # Hypoxia: Patient with hypoxia throughout stay, initially requiring 6LNC and face mask, thought to be multifactorial in setting of pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, and lymphangitic spread of tumor to lungs.
Of note, patient was never officially ruled out for pulmonary embolism (had CT chest w contrast that was not protocoled for PE), but as this would not change management (already on therapeutic lovenox as above) CT PE was not obtained.
Initiated taxol for presumed tumor burden component.
She had increased O2 requirement to 6LNC on [**2112-4-21**] which may have been from small PTX after L pleruex placement or increased R infiltrate which was possibly pneumonia, fluid or lymphangitic spread.
This most likely represented a component of lymphangitic spread but since pna couldn't be ruled out, she will complete a 5 day course of Levofloxacin.
# Hyponatremia: Sodium ranged from 125-130, initally thought to be hypovolemic in setting of intravascular depletion (had low albumin, lots of third-spaced fluids).
# UTI: Ucx [**4-11**] grew pan-sensitive E. coli for which the patient was treated w IV ceftriaxone (d1= [**4-11**]) treated for 7-day course.
# Breast Cancer s/p b/l mastectomy (Her 2 negative, ER/PR positive) - She was continued on anastrozole, and as discussed above, started taxol chemotherapy while inpatient.
#Hallucinations: Pt developed visual hallucinations during ICU stay.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic Breast Cancer Malignant Pericardial Effusion/cardiac tamponade Malignant Pleural Effusion Atrial Fibrillation Deep venous Thrombosis  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital due to SOB and were found to have fluid around your heart (pericardial effusion) as well as in your lungs.
The fluid in these was found to be malignant and consistent with metastatic breast cancer, so you were started on chemotherapy to control this, which is called Taxol and you will receive this weekly on 3 weeks and then have one week off.
While you were in the hospital you also developed an abnormal heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation) and have been started on medications for this, as well as a DVT (clot) in your upper extremity) for which you were started on a blood thinner and a UTI that was treated for 7 days with antibiotics.
