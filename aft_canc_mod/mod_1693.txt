He states that he has been in his usual state of health except for feeling more easily fatigued over the past 2 weeks accompanied by some "gas pain" and "burping" which is unusual for him but has still been able to walk to his usual extent and climb several flights of stairs without issue.
However, today after returning home from teaching class he began to feel chest heaviness that radiated to his left arm, which failed to improve and thus went to see his PCP.
At PCPs office pt had EKG showing sinus bradycardia, and subtle nonspecific ST depressions V1-V4.
He received ASA 325mg pta, NTGx1 with drop in blood pressure to 80mmHg, resolved with IVF with SBP rising to 100mmHg.
He was still having persistent chest pain/pressure and was given morphine 4mg, but continued to have chest pressure and thus was brought to the ED.
EKG showed ST depressions and TWI in V1-V2 but w/o prominent R waves; however posterior leads were placed with elevations in V5, V6.
Taken emergently to cath lab for posterior wall STEMI and had a BMS to OM.
Cath notable for severe 3V dz, atretic LIMA, patent SVG-D, occluded SVG-RPDA, LVEDP 24mmHg, LV gram w lat HK.
Denies any symptoms recently or in past of heart failure.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

The LAD had 80% stenosis in the mid-vessel segment, and some diffuse distal disease.
The LCX had 70% stenosis in the proximal  segment.
The dominant RCA was diffusely diseased with focal 80% stenoses in the proximal and distal vessel segments.
Arterial conduit angiography revealed a diffusely atretic LIMA-LAD graft, which was sub-selectively engaged.
Venous conduit angiography revealed a patent SVG-D graft.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left-sided filling pressures with an LVEDP 27mmHg.
Systemic arterial pressure was elevated with a measured central aortic pressure of 159/77/108.
There was no significant gradient across the AV on pullback.
There was focal lateral wall hypokinesis on LAO projection.
Elevated left-sided filling pressures (LVEDP 27mmHg).
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with probable hypokinesis of the mid to distal inferior and inferolateral segments.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD.
No significant valvular abnormality seen.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 81 year-old man with a history of VFib arrest in [**2150**], s/p CABG at [**Hospital1 112**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-D, SVG-RCA) in [**2150**] and ICD placement for SSS, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, dyslipidemia w/ ECG changes concerning for posterior wall STEMI with BMS to OM but who will require futher management of 3 vessel CAD.
# CAD/STEMI: Pt had 3 vessel disease and got BMS to OM.
Started on ASA 325 mg PO daily, Plavix 75 mg for month, Metoprolol XL and Lisinopril 5 mg  # Elevated LVEDP: Pt has no signs of failure or volume overload on exam.
The high LVEDP on TTE is most likely a result of diastolic dysfunction [**2-21**] to ischemic cardiomyopathy which hopefully should improve with revasularization.
# HLD - not on medication at home.
We started Atorvastatin 80mg daily  # CKD: Looking at Atrius records, it seems baseline creatinine has fluctuated between 1.2-1.6.  remained within this range in house  # prostate/breast cancer- gone untreated  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: Will f/u with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] per [**Location (un) 2274**].Dr.

Your EKG and cardiac enzymes confirmed that you were having a heart attack.
You will be seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in the future, for consideration of another bypass surgery or another percutaneous coronary intervention.
- START nitroglycerin as needed for chest pain.
You can take one more tablet if the chest pain has not gone away but call 911 at this point.
Please let Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] know if you have any chest pain at all.
