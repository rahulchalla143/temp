Family History: mother-colon CA  Physical Exam: On admission: O: T:98.2  BP: 153/64 HR:80    R:16    O2Sats: 100% Gen: intubated HEENT: Laceration to right parietal/occipital area, blood in right ear canal but no hemotympanum bilaterally Pupils: R 2mm NR L 1mm NR    EOMs: unable to assess Neuro: GCS 6 (E-1, V-1, M-4) Mental status: Intubated, no eye opening to voice or noxious stimuli.
Her eyes were open to voice and occasionally spontaneously.
Extra-axial hemorrhage as described above, likely increased in total volume.
Large subgaleal hematoma with small subcutaneous foreign bodies, likely glass shards.
Extra-axial lesion over the right frontal lobe, likely meningioma.
Limited examination demonstrates irregularity of the left vertebral artery at the level of the C2 fracture, much of which is thought to represent vessel tortuosity, though there are at least two concerning static images which could represent focal intimal injury with flap, without complete occlusion.
Attenuation of the V3 and V4 segments may be on a congenital or posttraumatic basis.
A follow-up examination is suggested to exclude the possibility of a minor vertebral artery injury.
Unchanged appearance of the comminuted Type [**3-21**] fracture of C2, with what likely represent disc herniations, largest essentially at C2-3, moderately narrowing the canal.
Fracture to the base of dens extending through the left transverse foramen and into the left superior articular facet, with interval increase in craniocaudal distraction of approximately 2 mm and minimal leftward angulation of the dens.
Large central disc herniation with narrowing of the spinal cord at the C2 to C3 level.
Moderate left-sided intervertebral disc herniation at the C5 to C6 level with associated narrowing of the central canal.
Evolving multi-compartmental hemorrhage and subdural collections, mild mass effect and no evidence for interval bleeding given differences in technique.
Multifocal regions of abnormal slow diffusion, much of which likely relates to the blood products, though the presence of superimposed infarcts cannot be excluded, particularly within the left centrum semiovale.
Extensive diffuse scalp edema with paranasal sinus and mastoid air cell disease.
Bilateral globe deformities.
_____at the level of the C2 fracture within the left vertebral artery is identified by MRA as suggested on the preceding CTA.
No definite obstruction or ileus.
Chest X-ray [**2181-3-7**]: In comparison with the study of [**3-5**], there has been substantial  clearing of the volume loss at the left base with sharp definition of the hemidiaphragm.
Mild atelectatic streaks persists.
Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
She was put on Ancef for infection prophylaxis.
She was in a cervical collar due to her unstable C2 fracture.
Her Chest X-rays consistently showed changed consistent with atelectasis/aspiration pneumonia/contusion.
Repeat CTA and CT on [**2-28**] showed no change in hemorrhage but suggestion of tortuosity of Left vertebral artery.
Neurology was consulted to comment on this scan and potential need for anticoagulation and reason for lack of cognitive improvement.
CT head after removal showed no new hemorrhage.
The patient had a fever of 101.5 and was pancultured.
Her sputum culture revealed pseudomonas and she was started on ciprofloxacin.
They felt that her lack of improvement was due to diffuse axonal injury.
Additionally she had abdominal distention and the KUB revealed no ileus or obstruction.
She was afebrile on [**2181-3-7**].
Polyvinyl Alcohol-Povidone 1.4-0.6 % Dropperette Sig: [**2-17**] Drops Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dryness.

Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
