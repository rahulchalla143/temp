Admission Date:  [**2148-10-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2148-10-17**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: increased tumor burden, Urosepsis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central venous access Arterial line Nephrostomy tube (percutaneously)  History of Present Illness: 87 year old female w/hx of urothelial carcinoma of the right renal pelvis with lymph node involvement and likely bilateral adrenal metastases p/w 3 days of diarrhea and vomiting and weakness and malaise.
This AM, acute onset cramping upper abdominal pain intermittently radiating to Right flank.
No documented but + subjective fevers.
Her diarrhea is described as soft but not watery.
Positive fevers chills sweats, denies dyspnea nor chest pain.
Minimal cough non productive.
She denies chest pain or shortness of breath.
Patient is not currently undergoing treatment for her cancer followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
EKG at presentation: NSR at 106, RBBB, LAFB, No ST changes.
HR in 110s, EKG with LAD and RBBB, no priors for comparison.
Exam notable for LUQ, epigastric tenderness, +voluntary guarding.
CXR shows pleural effusion +/- PNA, started on CTX and Azithro prior to CT chest.
UA c/w UTI vs result of urothelial CA.
Concern for PE, CT torso shows hydro with perinephric stranding.
Spoke with oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], agree with plan, may need nephrostomy and chest tube if pleural effusion doesn't improve.
no previous UCx in system .
Imaging: CXR prelim: Low lung volumes with elevated right hemidiaphragm and small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Diagnostic considerations include growing pleural effusion with associated atelectasis versus post-obstructive consolidation with accompanying pleural effusion.
No pulmonary emboli.
Marked progression of urothelial cancer and metastatic disease with moderate to severe right hydronephrosis and perinephric stranding and fluid which could represent forniceal rupture.
Review of systems: (+ /- ) Per HPI   Past Medical History: PMH: hypercholesterolemia hypothyroidism arthritis  prior reaction to anesthesia .
PAST ONCOLOGY HISTORY: - presented with gross hematuria, urine cytology done [**2148-3-4**] was positive for atypical urothelial cells presented in clusters suspicious for urothelial cell carcinoma - [**2148-3-4**] CT abdomen/pelvis showed a large mass in the right renal pelvis consistent with urothelial tumor, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and indeterminate bilateral adrenal masses could represent metastatic disease.
- [**2148-3-25**] Biopsy of retroperitoneal lymph node mass was positive for high grade carcinoma, most consistent with urothelial origin - [**2148-6-3**]: CT Torso revealed the large mass in the right renal pelvis (5.5 x 4.7 x 3.7 cm) with encasement and narrowing of the collecting system, bilateral adrenal masses and massive retrocaval lymphadenopathy .
Her sister died of rheumatic fever.
She has two nieces, who died of breast cancer and a third niece, who had breast lumpectomies but is currently alive.
Her son died at the age of 41 of leukemia and her daughter is healthy.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM 96.2  120s   87/51  and then 117/51  96  36 NRB General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress  but uncomfortable HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP to neck Lungs: poor inspiratory effort, no wheeze, rales at right base, reduced breath sounds at right base.
moderately labored breathing.
CV: irreg irreg,  no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, mildly TTP in RUQ and right flank.
no rebound or guarding.
GU: foley Ext: cool, mottling, no edema B/L LE.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Marked progression of urothelial cancer and metastatic disease as detailed above with moderate-to-severe right hydronephrosis and perinephric stranding with fluid which could represent forniceal rupture in addition to malignant involvement/possible infection.
New moderate right-sided pleural effusion.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
5.4-cm right renal lesion consistent with known urothelial carcinoma.
Brief Hospital Course: 87 year old woman with little PMH aside from recent history of metastatic urothelial carcinoma with lymph node involvement and likely adrenal metastases who presents w/ 3 days of malaise, diarrhea and vomiting x days now with respiratory distress, elevated lactate, possible UTI, SIRS physiology, and marked progression of urothelial cancer with right hydronephrosis and perinephric stranding and forniceal rupture.
Intubated in the context of sepsis and multiorgan failure.
# Right hydronephrosis with possible forniceal rupture: the most common etiology of renal forniceal rupture is obstruction caused by distal ureteric stones followed by malignant extrinsic ureteric compression of which the latter was likely involved.
IR placed a nephrostomy tube in the right kidney but US showed persistent R hydronephrosis despite drainage tube.
# Transaminitis: Most likely secondary to liver ischemia.
Picture of high transaminitis + high LDH + elevated creatinine is classic for ischemic liver disease.
Budd-chiari syndrome and hepatic congestion secondary to heart failure, would not lead to such high transaminitis.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Likely ATN secondary to hypotension + sepsis + urothelial CA.
# Respiratory distress: unclear etiology, no overt pulmonary edema but low lung volumes (elevated right hemi diaphragm as well), small effusions bilaterally, no recent echo if cardiogenic w/ elevated troponins.
Could also be [**2-28**] Sepsis and attempt at respiratory compensation for primary metabolic acidosis.
However ABG w/ A-a gradient and signs of hypoxemic, hypercarbic respiratory distress.
Atalectasis contributing factor w/ possible sympathetic effusion.
She was intubated until point of terminal exubation.
# Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma: currently not undergoing therapy.
# hypothyroidism - continued synthroid .
# arthritis - giving stress dose steroid in lieu of prednisone taper at this point.
