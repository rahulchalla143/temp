She then developed copious with multiple episodes of brown-colored emesis every hour.
The vomiting and diarrhea lasted until the early hours of the morning; after they stopped, she suddenly had shaking chills.
She then started feeling very short of breath with minimal exertion.
She missed mass because she was feeling so poor.
Her primary doctor thought that she might have a pneumonia and started her on an antibiotic.
CTA of her chest demonstrated right middle and lower lobe consolidation but no evidence of PE.
Her blood pressure remained low (ranging 83-106 systolic), so she was given 1.5L of saline and admitted to the ICU for further care.
Upon arrival to the ICU, she was anxious and coughing but otherwise without complaint.
Also reports [**3-18**] pillow orthopnea ever since her lobectomy.

Diffuse non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2105-7-6**] there is no diagnostic change.
[**2105-12-28**] CXR: Sinus tachycardia with atrial premature depolarizations.
Diffuse non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2105-7-6**] there is no diagnostic change.
No pulmonary embolus or acute aortic abnormality.
Multifocal consolidation in the right middle and right lower lobe, likely infection, although underlying malignancy can not be excluded.
Given history of lung cancer, recommend followup imaging to resolution to exclude underlying lesion.
Increased number of anterior mediastinal lymph nodes, not enlarged by size criteria, but increased in number.
Likely small amount of sludge layering in the gallbladder without acute cholecystitis.
[**2105-12-29**] CT Chest: No acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
Assessment for metastases is not complete on the present study and if there is concern for the same, MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] can be considered if there is no contra-indication.
CXR [**12-30**]: As compared to the previous examination, the presence of a relatively extensive right basal parenchymal opacity is confirmed.
Newly appeared is a small retrocardiac opacity that could represent either atelectasis or another focus of infection.
There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course: 73 year old woman with recent LUL lobectomy for NSCLC who presented with shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting and cough.
# Shortness of breath and cough/Pneumonia: She was diagnosed with pneumonia.
In the setting of recent nausea and vomiting, it was felt that she likely developed an aspiration pneumonia.
She was ruled out for influenza and had a negative urine legionella.
She was also given Atrovent and albuterol nebulizations as needed for dyspnea.
# Atrial fib/flutter: She has a history of paroxysmal Afib and went into atrial flutter with variable conduction on [**2105-12-30**].
# Hypotension:  She initially had transient hypotension improved with IV fluids and her blood pressure returned to her baseline with SBP in the low 100's.
# Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea:  Her initial presentation was felt to be most likely related to a viral gastroenteritis.
Acute intracranial abnormality was ruled out with a CT head.
Cardiac ischemic was also thought less likely with an unchanged ECG on admission and negative cardiac enzymes.
# Acute renal failure:  Her creatinine was increased to 1.3 on admission from a baseline of 0.7.
This resolved with IV fluid hydration and was felt to be secondary to dehydration and hypotension.
# Lung Cancer s/p lobectomy:  Her oncology providers were contact[**Name (NI) **] and she has follow-up scheduled in [**Month (only) 404**].
She will need CT follow-up to resolution of RML and RLL infiltrates.
# Osteoporosis:  Continued on Actonel  # Anxiety:  Ativan prn was given for anxiety.
