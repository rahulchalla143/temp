Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 58 year old man with a history of metastatic melanoma with brain metastases who presents with constipation and abdominal pain.
His initial KUB and c-xray on admission did not show evidence of free air in the abdomen, and revealed only fecal loading in the colon.
He was initially admitted to the medical service for further evaluation of his abdominal pain and treatment of his presumed constipation.
Blood and urine cultures were obtained on admission which have no growth.
On [**2197-2-3**] his abdominal pain did not improve and a CT of abd/pelvis was contained which demonstrated SB perforation with contrast extravasation.
The Acute Care Surgery Service was consulted and took Mr. [**Known lastname **] to the operating room on [**2197-2-4**] for a small bowel resection with primary anastomosis.
Findings intra-operatively included diffuse intra-abdominal metastatic melanoma including two areas of proximal small bowel perforation with related purulent peritonitis.
Patient remained A&Ox3 though confused and perseverative as was apparent preoperative baseline.
Remained hemodynamically stable without pressor requirement and did require intermittent IV hydralazine for hypertension.
Cipro and flagyl were continued postop while in SICU to prophylax against tertiary peritonitis and pt remained afebrile while in SICU.
Of note, he continued to have an oxygen requirement of only 1-2L NC, and mild crackles were noted on lung exam on [**2-9**].
A cxray was obtained which showed only mild LLL atelectasis.
Prior to discharge he had a bowel movement and was tolerating a regular diet without nausea or abdominal pain.
However, it was noted that he had a decrease in appetite and poor PO intake.
He continued to pass flatus and deny symptoms of nausea or abdominal pain.
A foley catheter was placed intraoperatively and removed on [**2-6**], at which time he voided without difficulty.
Palliative care was also consulted given the patient's prognosis and diagnosis of metastatic melanoma.
His vital signs are stable and he is without complaints of abdominal pain.
He has evidence of bowel function.
