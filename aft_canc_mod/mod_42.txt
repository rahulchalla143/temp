A large lytic lesion is present involving the humeral head and proximal humerus.
This is concerning for metastatic disease.
Taking into account the recent chest x-ray that did not demonstrate evidence of malignancy, this is concerning for metastasis from a renal cell carcinoma and abdominal CT is recommended for further evaluation.
Extensive pleural thickening and calcification likely from asbestos exposure.
Rounded pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe, suspicious for metastasis.
There is a high risk for compression fracture in the future given the extent of these lesions.
Two suspicious enhancing areas within the right lobe of the liver raise the question of metastases, though the appearance is not typical.
Likely bilateral renal cysts, incompletely characterized.
Mild aneurysmal dilatation of the distal aspect of the abdominal aorta.
Roughly 50% stenosis of the right superficial femoral artery.
Bilateral atrial enlargement.
However, on day#1, he developed increasing agitation.
As his agitation and myoclonuse improved, he was extubated, and then transferred back to floor.
Pt also had malignancy w/u with torso CT.
This showed lung masses and abdominal mets.
The pathology from humerus revealed likely metastatic lung carcinoma.
However, based on discussions with family, pt was made CMO given very poor prognosis.
A few days after this change, on [**9-13**], the pt was found unresponsive and pronounced dead at 7:15AM.
