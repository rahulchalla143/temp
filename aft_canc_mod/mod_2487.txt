HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   She came to us in the Internal Medicine Service with atrial fibrillation and a lung mass.
This [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with a history of cholelithiasis was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2153-12-12**], for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography to remove a common bile duct stone.
The case was complicated by atrial fibrillation to the 160s.
On [**2153-12-15**], a chest x-ray was done to rule out congestive heart failure as a cause, and a right hilar mass was found.
Chest CT showed a large bihilar mass invading into the right lung parenchyma and bilateral pleural effusions which were very concerning small-cell lung cancer.
Coronary artery disease with angina.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.
She had no jugular venous distention.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Distant heart sounds.
The chest showed diffuse wet crackles bilaterally.
Extremities showed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram on [**2153-12-17**], revealed sinus tachycardia at 100, normal axis, normal intervals, T wave flattening in I and F.  No V3 tracing.
Chest x-ray on [**2153-12-15**], showed interstitial edema, small bilateral effusions.
Chest CT on [**2153-12-15**], showed no filling defects; however, right greater than left pleural effusion with atelectasis, soft tissue mass bilateral hilar with subcarinal extending into the right lung parenchyma obliterating the bronchus intermedius, mild narrowing of right and left main stem bronchi concerning for small-cell lung cancer.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had new onset atrial fibrillation.
for rate control.
It was determined that anticoagulation would not be beneficial because the lung cancer represented a bleeding risk, so no further anticoagulation was done.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  From a congestive heart failure perspective, the patient was volume overloaded in congestive heart failure, which may have resulted in her being in atrial fibrillation because atrial fibrillation stopped on the medications and with the diuresis that was achieved.
She was gradually given hydration without recurrence of her atrial fibrillation.
PROPHYLAXIS:  For prophylaxis because of her gastroesophageal reflux disease, she was given lansoprazole.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Coronary artery disease with stable angina.
