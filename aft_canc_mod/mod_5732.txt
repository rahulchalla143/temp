HEENT: anicteric sclera, MMM, PERRL, plethoric neck, unable to assess JVD given body habitus CV: RRR nl S1 S2, no m/r/g but distant heart sounds LUNGS: diffusely rhonchorous, crackles half way up bilateral lung fields R>L ABDOMEN: +BS, obese, soft NTND, no HSM appreciated EXT: 1+ edema bilateral LE  Pertinent Results: [**2168-3-16**] CXR: There is consolidation/atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
Interval decrease in size of left pleural effusions, which is small.
There is no evidence of CHF.
Cardiac contour is obscured by the left consolidation and pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
Can not rule out a focal wall motion abnormality.
A bioprosthesis is noted in the mitral position.
There is trace valvular MR with a MVA of 2 cm2.
Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant patient revealed three vessel native coronary artery disease.
The LAD had a proximal 80% lesion, diffuse mid disease to 80-90% involving a large diagonal which had an origin 70% lesion.
Limited hemodynamics revealed low systemic blood pressure at 83/49 with mild pulmonary diastolic hypertension at 21mmHG.
Due to severity of CAD with mitral regurgitation, intubated status with recent ultrafiltration and clinical picture consistent with cardiogenic shock and intra aortic balloon pump (Arrow 30cc) was placed.
Patent bilateral greater saphenous veins, that on the right below the knee was not assessed due to an overlying boot.
The right system could not be assessed due to a central line.

This was medically managed and now she returns with decompensated left ventricular systolic heart failure.
She was treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin &, flagyl for question of pneumonia.
She was changed to vancomycine and meropenum per infectius diseases after having fevers.
She continued on CVVH, remained intubated for respiratory failure and question of ARDS, continued on vancomycin and meropenum for sepsis of unclear etiology, and remained on her vasoactive drips.
She was seen by speech and swallow several times who ultimately recommended thin  liquids, soft solids and supervised feeds and aspiration precautions.
She continued to do well from a surgical perspective, finished her antibiotics but was deconditioned and was ready for rehab on POD #14.
