PROCEDURE:  Repair of flank hernia with mesh and division of omental graft.
INDICATION:  This gentleman has had multiple operations for problems of myeloma decline.
Most recently, he had an omental graft which was harvested from the intra-abdominal cavity, brought out through a flank wound and into an open wound of the back.
Unfortunately, he has developed a hernia in this area.
The hernia itself was large and bothersome but, more importantly, it is very large and contains a fair amount of small and large intestine, through a relatively [**Name2 (NI) 15403**] defect.
This does place him at risk for incarceration or strangulation.
FINDINGS:  There was quite a large hernia sac.
We thought that this would be perfectly reasonable as the defect could not be closed without removing it without a high-risk of recurrence and also that the tissue had already experienced inset for the past several years and was vascularized with surrounding focal vasculature.
We began the most anterior part and ran these around with running full- thickness mattress sutures.
The area was then inspected for hemostasis which was quite adequate.
CLOSURE:  The sac tissue was closed over the top of this in order to exclude it from the wound and also to decrease seroma formation.
Previous lumbar decompression.
Multiple myeloma involving the lumbar spine.
History of a dural tear.
History of a previous omental flap.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Severe stenosis at lumbar spine at L3-L4.
FINDINGS:  Severe stenosis at L3-L4 as well as to some degree at L4-L5.
Significant dural scar tissue.
INDICATIONS:  This is a 63 year-old gentleman who [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1834**] elective procedure involving the repair of a flank hernia from a previous omental flap to cover a lumbar wound.
He has a complicated history with underlying multiple myeloma of the lumbar spine as well as previous lumbar decompression complicated by diskitis and osteomyelitis as well as a dural tear and revision surgery.
Postoperatively from the hernia repair he had progressive weakness of his right leg greater than his left leg as well as loss of rectal tone.
A CT myelogram was performed as he could not have an MRI because of a pacemaker.
Due to the severity of the clinical findings as well as the CT myelogram it was felt that this was adequate although not optimal.
He had significant scar tissue on his back from his previous omental flap and resections.
On the left side there appeared to be no bone laterally that could be stripped of soft tissue as was consistent with the CT scan.
On the right side there was bony tissue visualized and the L5 pedicle was visualized at that point.
The dural sac at that point was felt to be freely mobile without significant posterior compression.
Significant ligamentum flavum and hypertrophic ligamentum flavum had been removed at the L3-L4 level.
Below this it was felt that the risks of a dural tear were too high versus looking for a ventral lesion.
Infected posterior lumbar wound with persistent dural     leak.
Multiple myeloma involving L5 and S1.
Status post wound dehiscence with omental flap,     persistent dural leak and infection.
Infected posterior lumbar wound with persistent dural     leak.
Multiple myeloma involving L5 and S1.
Status post wound dehiscence with omental flap,     persistent dural leak and infection.
Large fluid collection just above the dura.
A dural tear that was the size of approximately a 20     gauge needle tip on the right side at the level of the     inferior aspect of the L2 lamina as predicted on CT     based on CT myelogram.
X-ray showing no retained hardware.
Blood cultures grew out gram-negative rods.
A lumbar puncture was positive for significant number of white cells as well as protein without glucose.
An aspiration of a fluid collection on a new CT of his lumbar spine also showed gram-negative rods.
On review with the radiologist, the previous CT monitoring done on [**10-16**], there is a dural leak that was not previously present.
At that time, there was no posterior fluid collection.
Secondary to the fact that there was a fluid collection in his lumbar spine as well as gram negative rods, he was consented through his fiance for an I and D of his lumbar spine and at this point also could address the persistent dural leak.
There was a poke hole and no other area of leakage was noted.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 64 year old man with acute decrease in mental status.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please r/o acute bleed/infx.
INDICATION: History of E-coli bacteremia.
Acute decrease in mental status.
TECHNIQUE: CT head without intravenous contrast.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass, infarct, or shift of normally midline structures.
Again noted a tiny focus of low density within the left parietal region adjacent to vertex, likely represents an area of chronic ischemic change.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage, mass, or edema.
Subtle areas of infection/abscess would be better demonstrated by MRI.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 46422**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a repair of a right flank incisional hernia on [**10-13**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of plastic surgery with no intra-operative complications.
Post-operatively he developed right and left lower extremity weakness and decreased sensation, right > left; decreased motor and sensory apparent on exam.
A CT scan of his thoracic/lumbar/spine was obtained with abnormalities found involving the L4-S1 levels which compared to last CT of [**4-16**] findings of L4-L5 were significantly worse correlating with his exam, an MR was recommended but deferred secondary to patient's pacemaker.
On HD 2 he was then taken back to the operating room and [**Date Range 1834**] a revision decompression of the lumbar spin from L2-L3 to L5-S1 with the findings of severe stenosis at lumbar spine L3-L4 by the spine service with no intra-operative complications.
On HD 3 he was extubated without difficulty and [**Date Range 1834**] a repeat CT myelogram with findings of improvement of spinal canal stenosis, with moderate degree stenosis remaining at L3/L4 level secondary to herniated disc.
The spinal service reviewed myelogram with no further interventions recommended since there was no critical stenosis remaining.
On HD 4 he was transferred to an in-patient nursing unit, his diet was advanced, his pain was controlled on intravenous Dilaudid and remained afebrile.
On HD 9 he developed sepsis with tachycardia, hypotension, febrile, hypoxia, and mental status changes.
Cultures from blood, wound, and cerebrospinal fluid demonstrated E.Coli with sensitivity to Ciprofloxacin and Ceftazidime, and persistent MRSA osteomyelitis.
He had leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18k.
On HD 10 he [**Date Range 1834**] a CT myelogram which demonstrated a dural leak, he was taken back to the operating room with findings of a infected dural leak, wound dehiscence with omental flap, and cauda equina syndrome; he [**Date Range 1834**] a laminotomy revision of L2, incision and drainage, and dural repair.
On HD 12 he was successfully extubated, the Ciprofloxacin and Vancomycin were discontinued after final sensitivities were reported, he was awake with diminished mental status function.
He was hemodynamically stable with a hematocrit of 26, tube feeds were initiated via a Dobbhoff tube, and he was receiving subcutaneous Heparin and pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis, he had movement of his lower extremities at his thighs bilaterally; bilateral lower extremity ultrasound was negative for thrombosis.
On HD 14 his white blood cell count had continued elevation to 23k, his mental status was still without improvement, he was afebrile, oxygenating well on nasal cannula; a head, spine, and chest CT scans were done with nonfocal abnormalities and stable findings, negative for pulmonary embolus; stool cultures were negative for C. Diff although he was placed on empiric Flagyl, a repeat lumbar puncture was performed at the level of L2-L3 with no bacteria identified.
On HD 20 he was found to be unresponsive to command with stable vital signs and a white blood cell count of 13k, a head CT scan was negative for acute changes or bleeding, an EKG and cardiac enzymes were negative for ischemia, an EEG showed mild encephalopathy without epileptiform; his Valproic Acid level was found to be sub-therapeutic, he was bolussed with adjustments made in his daily dose and improvement was noted in his mental status.
On HD 26 calorie counts were initiated with oral intake encouraged, tube feeds were stopped, he was evaluated by speech and swallow therapy without evidence of aspiration or dysphagia; he received his monthly dose of IVIG for his multiple myeloma without adverse reactions.
On HD 28 he had an episode of supraventricular tachycardia which resolved spontaneously with desaturation to 90% on room air, EKG was without ischemia, chest x-ray was without changes or pneumothorax, his oxygenation improved with nasal cannula, he was afebrile without leukocytosis.
He was followed by physical therapy throughout his hospitalization with recommendations of continued therapy to increase his balance and transfer training, strength, and functional mobility.
He continued to have loose bowel movements, C.Diff samples were negative to date, he was started on Imodium which was to be continued upon discharge to [**Location (un) 38**].
Upon discharge to [**Location (un) 38**] his pain was well controlled with Oxycodone elixir, he was afebrile, and was to continue the Ceftazidime until [**11-18**].
