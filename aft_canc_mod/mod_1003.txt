Admission Date:  [**2204-12-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2204-12-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2125-2-17**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3565**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**12-13**] intubation [**12-13**] left femoral CVL [**12-13**] left subclavian CVL [**12-14**] arterial line  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 26812**] is a 79 year old man with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who presented to the ER today with dyspnea for the past 2 days.
He had recently undergone thoracentesis on [**2204-11-29**] with 700 cc of fluid drained.
He has been on Bactrim for treatement of Moraxella found on BAL culture on [**2204-11-29**].
US and CXR showed a large left-sided pleural effusion.
Post-thoracentesis CXR showed persistent collapse of left hemithorax.
He was treated emperically with Levofloxacin for concern for infection.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - known left lung pulmonary nodule since [**2199**], followed with serial imaging.
- [**2204-11-8**] developed dyspnea with exertion, dry cough, left sided chest discomfort and fatigue - [**2204-11-4**]: imaging showed left-sided pulmonary mass, mediastinal/hilar adenopathy, left pleural effusion and impending left airway obstrcution - [**Date range (3) 33359**]: admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for evalution, CT [**2204-11-29**] showed complete obstruction of the left upper lobe with post obstructive upper lobe collpase with small to moderate left pleural effuison, paraesophageal lymph node, mulitple prevascular lymph nodes and aortopulmonary lymph nodes.
There was also a lytic lesion in the lateral aspect of the left 6th rib and focal lucent area in the right T11 vertebra.
The pleural fluid, lymph nodes stations 7, 4R, 4L and 11 showed adenocarchioma post-obstructive pneumonia with Moraxella catarrhalis.
- [**2204-12-7**]: PET scan showed FDG avid large left hilar tumor causing compression of the left upper lobe bronchus with LUL collapse, extensive FDG avid mediastinal adenopathy a loculated moderate left pleural effusion and extensive FDG avid osseous metastasis.
- [**2204-12-7**]: MRI Brain negative for brain mets  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia CAD s/p CABG [**2192**], depressed EF per report CKD with creatinine > 1.5 Nephrolithiasis [**2203**] Hernia Repair   Social History: Lives in [**Location (un) 5089**] with wife; previously in [**Location (un) **].
This places him at an approximate 45-pack-year history of smoking.
No exposure to radiation.
Mother died from sepsis (toxemia).
There is no other history of cancer in the family.
Physical Exam: VS T97.1 BP 110/70 HR 85 RR20 92% on 4L GENERAL: alert and oriented, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus.
LUNGS: Decreased breath sounds on the left.
Thoracentesis drain in place with bloody fluid draining.
Known left hilar mass causing left bronchial compression with complete collapse of the left upper lobe, stable, and near complete collapse of the left lower lobe, progressed since [**2204-11-29**].
Lytic lesions involving the left lateral sixth rib and vertebral body T12, most consistent with bony metastatic disease.
Multiple other bony sites of disease are better evaluated on the [**2204-12-7**] PET-CT.  [**12-13**] post-intubation CXR: The endotracheal tube is in standard placement.
Large left pleural effusion developed in the setting of left upper lobe collapse is larger now than it was at 1:00 p.m. shifting the mediastinum further to the right and collapsing the remainder of the left lung as before.
New right infrahilar consolidation is presumably atelectasis.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75%).
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload, with marked ventricular interaction.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2204-11-30**], severe right ventricular pressure and volume overload with marked ventricular interaction are now present.
Findings are consistent with acute-on-chronic right ventricular strain.
[**12-14**] Bilateral LENIs: IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with deep vein thrombosis within the Preliminary Reportbilateral popliteal and posterior tibial veins and right peroneal vein.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 26812**] is a 79 year old man with a history of stage IV NSCLC with recurrent pleural effusions and left-sided collapse who presented for dyspnea and was s/p a thoracentesis with 2L pleural fluid removed which was bloody.
Upon admission, he was sent immediately to radiology for CT chest, and at that time was feeling dyspneic but was in no distress.
Pt appeared mildly uncomfortable and was started on fentanyl/versed.
Bedside echo was performed and showed right sided volume overload with underfilling of LV.
Bedside bronchoscopy was performed and showed severe extrinsic compression of left bronchus from known hilar mass, but there were no secretions or mucous plugs.
He was also started on empiric vancomycin and zosyn in case sepsis was playing any role in his acute decline.
Formal echo confirmed rigth heart strain with under filling of the left ventricle, and bilateral DVTs were found on LENIs.
