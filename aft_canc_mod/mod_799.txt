He reports having a "difficult" night with significant diarrhea and nearly no sleep.
EKG showed new ST depression in V5, V6 but the 1st set of cardiac enzymes negative.
The pain was similar to his usual once-a-week anginal equivalent pain which is typically responsive to SL nitro.
After these medications, the pain was gone but patient reports feeling residual "neck pulsations."
This symptom prompted a carotid artery US study, which showed 60-70% stenosis bilaterally.
#2 GIB:  There was one report of black stool, which was suspicious for upper GI source.
DDX included PUD, gastritis.
No further bleeding episodes in ICU or on the floor.
However, he had a delayed reponse with rapid Hct rise in subsequent days.
EGD was performed which showed no abnormality.
Colonoscopy was performed which showed diverticuli with no active bleed.
The patient was not symptomatic with his low blood pressure in terms of lightheadedness or syncope.
#4 Acute renal failure - acute on chronic renal insufficiency with creatinine 2.3 at admission (baseline cr 1.5-1.6).
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: [**11-29**] Capsules PO once a day as needed for constipation.
Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction 3.
Acute renal failure   Discharge Condition: Good - No further chest, neck or jaw pain; small hematoma at groin site is not expanding; hematocrit is stable and close to baseline; creatinine is stable at 1.1; shortness of breath occurs with mild exertion, but is similar to baseline; vital signs have been stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] with a bleed from your gastrointestinal tract.
An EKG and blood tests showed that you had a minor heart attack.
You also went for an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy to try to identify the source of the bleeding that you experienced prior to your admission.
We made the following changes to your medication regimen: -DO NOT TAKE Coumadin (warfarin) until/unless instructed to do so by your cardiologist or primary care doctor.
-BEGIN TAKING Ranitidine 150 mg PO twice daily as a substitute medication for omeprazole -BEGIN TAKING Colace 100 mg PO daily as needed to keep stool soft (softer stool may help to prevent future episodes of bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract).
