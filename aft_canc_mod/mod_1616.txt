On [**2140-7-25**], she developed hypoxia post thoracentesis requiring NRB and was transferred to the MICU.
Hypoxia was felt to be re-expansion pulmonary edema, potentially complicated by pneumonia given her fevers, worsening shortness of breath and hypoxia.
Initially, 600cc of serosanguinous fluid was drained.
She was able to be weaned to 3L NC and went back to the medical floor for management of hyponatremia and worsening renal function.
CVVHD was continued for hepatorenal syndrome.
She required intermittent sliding scale insulin for hyperglycemia due to steroids.
Fluid was sent for amylase.
Lower extremity non-invasives were done on [**8-25**] for asymmetrical lower extremity swelling (Left>right).
