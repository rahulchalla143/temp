Interval imaging showed decrease in abscess size in [**Month (only) 404**]; her last imaging was a CT scan on [**2123-1-18**] and showed no change in abscess size since [**Month (only) 404**] and showed intrahepatic biliary dilatation, as well as ill-defined opacity in caudate lobe worrisome for tumor recurrence.
ERCP was performed [**2123-1-26**] and revealed no evidence of extrahepatic biliary stricturing, diffuse stenosis of intrahepatic ducts with no lesion appropriate for stent placement.
Since the ERCP, patient has noted increased somnolence and fatigue; she has been falling asleep during conversations and has trouble going up and down stairs.
Patient endorses increased abdominal distention and LE edema over last two weeks; she is unclear as to whether she has gained weight recently.
Patient was admitted from clinic today after detailing these complaints for management of suspected infection and possible hepatic encephalopathy.
Currently, patient is resting comfortably in the hospital bed and is lucid, oriented x 3, and without acute complaints.
Patient complains of mild HA, nasal congestion x 2 days with no associated sinus congestion or SOB.
Mild cough x 2 days slightly productive of sputum.
Altered taste and poor appetite.
[**6-18**]: Multifocal HCC in both the left lobe and remainder of right lobe.
[**2122-9-8**]: TACE of the left hepatic lobe .
EGD on [**2122-4-10**] demonstrated normal esophagus without esophageal or gastric varices.
Ulcerative colitis x10 years.
Frequent urinary tract infections.
HCC s/p segmentectomy  Social History: She is a dentist who works with her husband in a mutually owned dental practice in [**Location (un) 686**].

Ill-defined low-attenuating area in caudate lobe concerning for tumor recurrence as suspected on prior CT, is better depicted on multiphasic study of [**2122-11-16**].
Interval increase in size of a moderate right pleural effusion.
Cirrhosis with intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Unchanged perigastric and perisplenic varices as well as splenomegaly with mass effect on left kidney.
Diffuse narrowing of the intrahepatic ducts is present, consistent with cirrhosis.
An area of contrast extravasation at the right posterior intrahepatic duct apparently corresponds to a prior drain site seen on a previous CT examination.
RUQ U/S [**2123-2-3**]: Nodular cirrhotic liver with a dominant 2.6-cm mass in the caudate lobe and several smaller suspicious nodules scattered elsewhere.
There is no residual fluid collection seen following prior drainage.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
New areas of low attenuation in both hepatic lobes, the largest in the left hepatic lobe measures 2.7 cm, concerning for new hepatic abscesses.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 58 year female with history of PBC complicated by cirrhosis, HCC s/p surgical resection, HCC recurrence s/p TACE complicated by biliary ischemia and hepatic abscesses s/p surgical drain placement and IV abx who presented with somnolence as well as fevers and was found to be hyponatremic with recurrent hepatic abscesses and blood cultures positive for MDR Pseudomonas.
MDR Pseudomonas bacteremia, hepatic abscesses: The patient's blood cultures were positive for MDR Pseudomonas from [**Date range (1) 28561**] likely secondary to recurrent hepatic abscesses which were discovered on a CT scan.
The Pseudomonas was cefepime/meropenem resistant, ceftazidime intermediate resistance, and cipro/zosyn sensitive.
Her old PICC line was discontinued and she was started on cipro monotherapy given her documented allergy to penicillin.
A new double lumen power PICC was placed on [**2-9**] after the patient had been blood culture negative and afebrile for several days.
Interventional radiology was consulted for hepatic abscess drainage, but felt that the abscesses were small enough where antibiotic penetration would be possible without drainage.
HCC: A CT abdomen/pelvis performed on [**2-7**] demonstrated progression of her known HCC as well as recurrent hepatic abscesses with no significant ascites.
She was treated with lactulose, lasix, aldactone, cholestyramine, ursodiol, and oxycodone with only minor modifcations in dosing when compared to her previous home regimen.
AMS/somnolence: Likely secondary to hyponatremia (Na=121 on admission) along with a component of hepatic encephalopathy.
CODE: The patient's code status was established as DNR/DNI this admission following a conversation with the patient and her family concerning her poor prognosis given her worsening liver failure secondary to treatment refractory, progressive HCC.
