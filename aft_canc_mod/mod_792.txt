LABS ON DISCHARGE: [**2152-4-10**] WBC 15.6, Hb 10.1, Hct 30.1, Plt 1011 PMN 86.6, Lymphs 9.5, Monos 2.8, Eos 0.9, Baso 0.2 Na 138/K 4.5, Cl 105/HCO3 26, BUN 17/Cr 0.6, Glu 101 Ca 8.4, Mg 1.9, P 3.8 PT 18.0, INR 1.6 Dig 0.8  RELEVANT IMAGING: [**2152-3-28**] CXR (on admission): Left lower lobe atelectasis and left pleural effusion; given the possible history of smoking, an obstructive neoplasm at the left hilum causing left lower lobe atelectasis and effusion cannot be excluded on this radiograph and is best further evaluated with a chest CT.  [**2152-4-8**] CXR (on discharge): There is background COPD with diffuse parenchymal scarring.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, though partially obscured on the left by a moderate-sized pleural effusion and underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
There is also a small right pleural effusion, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
Patchy opacities throughout both lungs may represent parenchymal scarring due to background COPD, but the possibility of a superimposed patchy interstitial process cannot be entirely excluded.
(The appearance is similar to a film dated [**2152-3-31**], at which time it was thought to represent extensive multifocal pneumonia.)
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Extensive multifocal pneumonia, worse in the left lower lobe.
Bilateral nonhemorrhagic mild-to-moderate pleural effusions, predominantly subpulmonic.
Bilateral reactive hilar adenopathy.
Mild dilatation of the aortic root.
[**2152-3-30**] [**Month/Day/Year **]: Hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function.
Moderate to severe anterior mitral valve leaflet prolapse with moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The severity of mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation appear to have decreased somewhat, although the overall image quality is worse on the current study.
[**2152-4-3**] [**Month/Day/Year **] WITH SALINE: No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old previously healthy woman with a history of controlled hypertension and 3+ mitral valve regurgitation who was admitted to the hospital for multifocal pneumonia and new onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response to the 150s, requiring a stay in the medical intensive care unit before transfer to the medical floor.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: # MULTIFOCAL PNEUMONIA: The patient was admitted for hypoxic respiratory failure with O2sats 84% on room air.
Chest x-ray showed left lower lobe consolidation and effusion.
Repeat CXR was consistent with acute volume overload (see below).
Lung ultrasound was not concerning for empyema or parapneumonic effusion.
The patient had persistently elevated A-a gradients on hospital days [**11-29**], so a CT scan was done to rule out a pulmonary embolus.
Given the patient's lack of improvement and ongoing leukocytosis with bandemia, her antibiotics were broadened to Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Levofloxacin.
Persistent leukocytosis on [**2152-4-8**] prompted a repeat CXR, which showed continued bilateral pulmonary effusion (L>R).
Interventional pulmonology performed a thoracentesis for concern of a paraneumonic effusion.
The pleural fluid was borderline exudative by Light's Criteria with negative cytologies and cultures.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION WITH RAPID VENTRICULAR RESPONSE: The patient has no prior history of atrial fibrillation.
Echocardiography with bubble study did not show any changes to the mitral valve and was negative for intracardiac and extracardiac shunt.
Ultimately, her new onset atrial fibrillation with RVR was thought to be related to her multifocal pneumonia and mitral valvular disease.
# ACUTE SYSTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: In the setting of volume resuscitation, the patient's new atrial fibrillation with RVR and her underlying mitral valve regurgitation led to acute systolic congestive heart failure with flash pulmonary edema.
Her initial EKG showed ST depressions that appeared to be rate related.
Acute coronary syndrome was unlikely as three sets of cardiac enzymes were within normal limits.
# ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: The patient's creatinine on admission was 1.9 (baseline 0.5-0.6).
The etiology was thought to be multifactorial, related both to intravascular volume depletion in the setting of acute systolic congestive heart failure and poor PO intake given her illness.
# PERSISTENT LEUKOCYTOSIS: The patient had persistent leukocytosis, prompting an additional workup for alternative infections.
This was likely due to SIADH in the setting of her pulmonary processes and/or intravascular volume depletion in the setting of her acute systolic congestive heart failure and poor PO intake.
This medication was held in the setting of her acute kidney injury and subsequent systolic blood pressures in the 90s-110s from the initiation of diltiazem.
# OSTEOPOROSIS: Restarted home calcium and vitamin D once she was taking POs.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you had difficulty breathing.
A chest x-ray was performed, which showed that you had pneumonia in multiple places in your lungs.
During your hospitalization, you were also found to have atrial fibrillation, an irregular heart beat pattern.
You were also started on coumadin to make your blood less likely to clot and to decrease the risk of stroke related to clotting that can occur in people with atrial fibrillation.
It showed that you have mitral valve prolapse and mitral valve regurgitation.
This means that the mitral valve in your heart does not close all the way, so some blood leaks through.
