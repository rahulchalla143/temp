Several small bullae are seen consistent with emphysematous changes.
There is no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
Pulmonary vasculatures are opacified without evidence for intraluminal filling defects.
There is no evidence for aortic dissection.
BONE WINDOWS: The vertebral bodies have a moth-eaten appearance consistent with the patients history of MM.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of PE or pneumonia.
CXR [**2143-4-25**]: PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Accounting for differences in patient rotation and lower lung volumes, there appears to be no significant interval change.
The lungs appear clear without consolidations.
No pleural effusions are seen.
No pulmonary edema is seen.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process .
[**2143-4-25**] Head CT: FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus or overt major vascular territorial infarction.
However, since the prior examination, there has been probable interval development of a triangular shaped 1 cm area of low absorption in the left parietal vertex subcortical white matter.
In that light, there are several additional areas of low absorption, each under a centimeter in size within both cerebral hemispheres that were likely seen on the prior study and could represent chronic small vessel infarcts as well.
There is mild bilateral ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening and a tiny air-fluid level within left maxillary sinus.
CONCLUSION: No intracranial hemorrhage.
MICRO DATA: ========== [**2143-4-25**] 7:19 am Influenza A/B by DFA       Source: Nasopharyngeal aspirate.
**FINAL REPORT [**2143-4-26**]**     DIRECT INFLUENZA A ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2143-4-26**]):       Positive for Influenza A viral antigen.
DIRECT INFLUENZA B ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2143-4-26**]):       NEGATIVE FOR INFLUENZA B VIRAL ANTIGEN.
Blood Culture [**2143-4-24**]: No growth to date Blood Culture [**2143-4-27**]: No growth to date   Brief Hospital Course: Brief Hospital Course: ====================== In the ED, the patient had diffuse exp wheezes, was hypoxic w/ O2 sat 88-90% on RA.
CXR was normal, CTA was done to investigate for PE and was normal.
After receiving ativan 2mg and dilaudid 1mg IV in prep for CTA, the pt became lethargic.
A dx of meningitis was considered, but LP was not performed due to INR 5.5; instead, he was empirically treated w/ levoflox 500mg, vancomycin 1gm, and meropenem 1gm IV.
However, influenza cultures came back positive for influenza A and it was felt that this explained his fever, respiratory distress and altered mental status.
He was extubated and had improvement in respiratory symptoms and improved mental status.
Of note, hospital course also complicated by episodes of paroxysmal afib w/ HR in 140s-160s, without hemodynamic instability.
In addtion, he was already anti-coagulated for history of DVT.
HTN was also an issue at this hospitalization, and for this the pt was maintained on metoprolol and an acei with good bp control.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 Puffs Inhalation Q 2H PRN () as needed for wheezing or SOB.
Senna 8.6 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Disp:*4 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospice and VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Influenza A Possible atypical bacterial pneumonia Supratherapeutic INR Multiple Myeloma with anemia, thrombocytopenia prostate cancer s/p resection HTN DVT's in past   Discharge Condition: Stable, oxygen saturation stable on 2-4L oxygen by nasal canula   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with respiratory distress that was caused by influenza A.
You also likely have emphysema based on your exam, chest x-ray and chest CT, however you should have pulmonary function tests once you are completely recovered from the flu to help clarify your lung status.
You were intubated, treated for flu, treated for a possible atypical pneumonia, and treated for emphysema with steroids.
You should follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] within the next 1-2 weeks for basic bloodwork and a physical exam.
