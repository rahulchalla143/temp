Admission Date:  [**2152-4-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2152-4-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-1-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Amphotericin B / Ambisome / Campath  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: 40 yo with cml s/p transplant complicated by GVHD presents with worsening sob.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p pericardial effusion drainage   History of Present Illness: Pt is a 40 yo male with a h/o CML s/p MUD (CMV+/+) BMT in [**2147**], complicated by chronic graft versus host disease of the skin, lung and liver, in addition to chronic thrombocytopenia.
He is currenlty on Prednisone tx for his severe GVHD of the skin.
He has chronic pulmonary problems with opacities in RML suggestive of BOOP and is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9504**].
He has been on high doses of steroids and other therapies for his pulmonary condition.
Pt was seen in clinic on [**2152-3-29**] for worsening sob and flu like symptoms.
Pt now presents with worsening sob and particularly on exertion.
No chest pain/orthopnea/pnd associated.
He does have cough on lying flat but is afebrile and has no sputum or haemoptysis.
He was evaluated in ER where he was noted to have a mod-severe size pericardial effusion on non contrast CT. Pt was given a full dose lovenox for dvt/pe and admitted for further evaluation.
GVHD--symptoms have included severe skin findings, thrombocytopenia requiring transfusions, bronchiolitis obliterans and mouth sores.
He has had a significant issue as in the past with cyclosporin and FK-506.
There were no significant changes in the few opacities that may represent underlying BOOP since his last scan several months ago.
HTN #.
chronic right extremity edema #.
Obstructive airways disease, possibly due to GVDH.
Social History: no EtOH, tobacco, drugs    Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: BP 100/60, pulsus of 20, hr 110, sats 93% on 3l, 98 GENERAL: pleasant, well-appearing man in no acute distress.
HEENT: PERRL with anicteric sclerae.
Conjunctivae remains dry and with some injection Oropharynx remains moist with some erythematous changes on the buccal mucosae.
NECK: Supple with thickening, no JVD visualised.
LUNGS: bilateral scattered rhonchi but good air entry and no crackles at bases.
distant heart sound, no m/r/g.
ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, and nondistended with normal bowel sounds and without hepatosplenomegaly appreciated.
EXTREMITIES: Edema of the right upper extremity, chronic per pt.
He has increased thickening in his lower extremities and mild edema overall.
Findings may be cause of patient's new onset dyspnea on exertion.
Resolution of previously noted right-sided pleural effusion with residual small left-sided pleural effusion and no interstitial disease or parenchymal opacity suggestive of underlying pneumonia identified.
Grossly stable appearance to right apical nodular opacity likely related to nodular scarring.
Subsegmental atelectasis.
No acute infiltrate.
There is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion.
There is right ventricular early diastolic invagination, consistent with impaired filling/early tamponade physiology.
New focal right lower lobe consolidation and small right pleural effusion.
This may be due to an acute infectious pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion given clinical suspicion for infection.
Peripheral and peribronchiolar opacities in the left lower lobe and inferior right middle lobe and lingula.
Persistent small left pleural effusion.
Moderate pericardial effusion, decreased in size since recent CT. .
[**2152-4-10**] CT Chest: Large left lower lobe consolidation is new.
While consolidation in the anterior basal segment of the right lower lobe has improved, there are new multiple peribronchial and subpleural ill-defined opacities in the upper lobe lingula and right middle lobe.
IMPRESSION:  Worsening of either COPD or pneumonia.
Decrease in small pericardial effusion.
Enlarging small left pleural effusion.
No pulmonary emboli in the central vessels, to the level of the subsegmental arteries.
Progression of the multifocal consolidations since the prior study, now involving both lower lobes, the right middle lobe and the lingula and, to a lesser extent, the right upper lobe.
Moderately large bilateral pleural effusions.
No significant short interval change in the appearance of the chest, with bilateral lower lobe consolidations, to a similar degree.
Opacities of the right middle lobe and lingula as well as the portion of the right upper lobe appear similar, with possible slight increase in nodular opacities in the lingula.
Moderate right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion are slightly decreased from the prior study.
Coronary artery calcifications.
Right pleural calcifications.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-4-14**], no pericardial effusion is identified on the current study.
The pleural effusions appear more prominent.
Possible new right upper lobe infiltrate.
A/P: 40 yo M with history of CML s/p MUD CMV+/+) BMT in [**2147**] complicated by GVHD of skin, lungs and liver, and chronic thrombocytopenia admitted for SOB secondary to influenza.
His hospital course was complicated by pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology s/p drainage of effusion in the CCU, respiratory distress from Tamiflu resistant influenza and superimposed bacterial PNA requiring ICU admission.
# Pneumonia: The patient was admitted for worsening shortness of breath and fevers in the setting of a positive DFA for influenza A.
Upon admission, a CXR showed worsening infiltrates most concerning for a superimposed bacterial infection.
He was put on Cefepime, Vanc, Azithromycin and Flagyl but his respiratory status continued to worsen with persistent fever spikes.
Posaconazole was later added for fungal coverage.
A CTA showed no evidence of PE but a multifocal pneumonia with progression of multifocal consolidations involving both lower lobes, right middle lobe, lingula and to a lesser extent, the right upper lobe.
He was started on Amantidine in the ICU for a brief period until Rimantidine could be obtained (the patient did not experience any neurologic side effects while on Amantidine).
In the ICU, the patient required NRB with persistent desaturations with any type of motion or exertion.
Additionally, the patient's immunosuppression was increased while in the MICU for question of BOOP but the appearance of his CT seemed more consistent with multifocal pneumonia and not BOOP so his steroids were tapered back to his home dose.
Because of falling platelets down to as low as 63, the patient was switched from Zosyn to Meropenem which was thought to have less thrombocytopenic effects.
He was observed for 3-4 days off antibiotics without fevers or increased oxygen requirement at which time he was discharged home with close followup.
#Influenza: The patient was started on Tamiflu for influenza and completed 14 days of Tamiflu.
He was switched briefly to Amantidine while awaiting the pharmacy to obtain Rimantidine (the patient did not experience any neurologic side effects while on Amantidine).
A repeat influenza DFA was sent and was negative for influenza.
The final viral culture is NGTD and will be monitored for 30 days for evidence of growth of influenza.
#Pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology: On admission, the patient was found to have a moderate pericardial effusion on CT scan.
A pulsus was found to be elevated and an echo showed evidence of early tamponade physiology.
Serial repeat echos showed no evidence of recurrent effusion or tamponade physiology.
# New atrial fibrillation/flutter: After the patient's pericardial effusion was drained and the drain removed, he was found to be in rapid afib/flutter.
This was thought to be secondary to irritation from the pericardial drain.
His Diltiazem was stopped as it was thought that his atrial fib/fluter was an isolated event in the setting of pericardial irritation from the drain.
However, the patient had a second episode of atrial fib/flutter with rates to the 160s.
He had no further episodes of flutter during this hospitalization.
During his MICU course, his steroids were increased slightly for concern of BOOP but this was tapered back to his home dose after no improvement was seen and his pulmonary process appeared to be consistent with consolidative pneumonia, not BOOP.
His blood pressures had to be taken in the lower extremity because of RUE DVT and left arm PICC line.
His ankle blood pressures seemed to correlate fairly well with his upper extremity pressures.
Additionally, he was put on long acting Diltiazem for atrial flutter.
#RUE edema and DVT: RUE edema is chronic [**3-10**] RUE DVT.
Benzonatate 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for cough.
Primary: Influenza Pneumonia complicated by bacterial pneumonia CML Atrial fib/flutter Pericardial effusion and tamponade, s/p drainage Severe GVHD of skin and lungs .
Persistent cough but improving slowly.
You were admitted for influenza complicated by superimposed bacterial pneumonia, pericardial effusion requiring drainage, and atrial flutter.
Please take all medications as prescribed: - Please take your long acting Diltiazem to prevent your heart from going back into a rapid rhythm called atrial flutter.
- You were also given medications for your cough which you can take on an as needed basis.
