Intraoperatively, it was found that the tumor could not be resected without a complete pneumonectomy therefore this was done.
An epidural was placed pre-op which provided pain relief.
She had an episode of orthostatic hypotension which resolved with fluids.
On POD#6 she was tolerating a regular diet and her pain was controlled with PO medications and she was deemed safe for D/C.
She was also given a course of 5 days of Levofloxacin for peri-operative pulmonary coverage.
