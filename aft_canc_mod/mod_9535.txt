Name:  [**Known lastname 17925**], [**Known firstname **]                          Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 17926**]  Admission Date:  [**2113-5-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2113-5-31**]  Date of Birth:   [**2030-5-10**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83 year-old female patient who was admitted to an outside hospital Emergency Department for chest pain approximately three days prior to admission associated with arm heaviness and nausea and vomiting.
She was subsequently discharged home, but the pain recurred two days later.
She presented to her primary care physician on [**2113-5-8**] and was noted to have ST changes on her electrocardiogram, which was obtained in the office and she was sent to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 960**].
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, significant smoking history approximately 120 pack years.
She has peripheral vascular disease and is status post right iliac stent for a nonhealing ulcer on the right heel.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
She subsequently ruled in for myocardial infarction.
The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2113-5-12**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] where she underwent coronary artery bypass graft times three with a mitral valve repair with a 26 mm ring.
The patient had some supraventricular dysrhythmias throughout the operation and was placed on Amiodarone for that reason.
The patient was extubated on postoperative day two, however, she remained very lethargic and difficult to arouse.
The patient was reintubated on postoperative day three due to increase work of breathing and tachypnea and enteral tube feeds were initiated at that time.
She was noted to have purulent secretions and cultures of those secretions grew out Moraxella for which she was placed on Levofloxacin and has completed a ten day course of that.
Neurologists initially believed this to be a central cord syndrome versus a small cerebrovascular accident.
The patient was placed in a soft cervical collar until spinal cord compression was ruled out.
The patient had another bronchoscopy the following day for copious amounts of secretions and she was subsequently extubated.
The following day the patient was reintubated for decreased mental status and increased respiratory distress.
At this point the Neurology Service strongly recommended an MRI to determine what the pathology was causing her neurological examination.
MRI of the head and neck were obtained and revealed multiple small fossae posterior infarcts, basilar artery infarcts, mild basilar artery stenosis and no spinal cord compression.
The patient was started the following day on a low dose heparin drip for her stroke and basilar artery stenosis.
She also had copious secretions, which she became unable to clear possibly due to fatigue.
On [**5-24**] the patient was noted to have an increase in white blood cell count.
She underwent a bronchoscopy again due to copious secretions and she had a percutaneous tracheostomy performed at the bedside as well as a PEG for feeding purposes.
She had some minor abdominal tenderness and went for chest, abdomen and pelvis CT scans, which were all negative.
Hematology consult was obtained at that time since there was no apparent source of infection due to increasing white blood cell count.
The patient did have a remote history of lymphoma and the question was brought up as to whether the white blood cell count was in some way related to the lymphoma.
The Hematology Service did not feel this was in any way related to her lymphoma and thought that we should continue to rule out an infection source.
The patient has had some diarrhea and she has had two negative C-difficile examination on her stool.
The patient was intermittently placed on low dose neo-synephrine around the [**5-26**] for one to two days due to some mild hypotension in the one teens in attempts to keep her systolic blood pressure higher, because of her neurologic status.
She also had intermittent bouts of atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response.
She expressed significant depressive symptoms to her family.
She was subsequently started on Celexa, however, this was discontinued after approximately three days due to increasing lethargy.
She appeared to be doing well from a respiratory standpoint.
On the [**5-29**] the patient was noted to hve increased lethargy, decreased responsiveness and was placed back on the ventilator due to worsening work of breathing with a PACO2 of 63.
On [**5-30**] the patient underwent a repeat MRI of her head and neck at the request of the Neurology Service, which showed no change from her previous study.
The patient was also noted on chest x-ray after being placed back on the ventilator to have a left pleural effusion.
She underwent a thoracentesis on [**5-30**] for approximately 400 cc of serosanguineous fluid.
Repeat chest x-ray showed reexpansion of the lung with no pneumothorax.
The patient had a gram stain of her sputum on the 18th, which was gram positive coxae, but the culture subsequently revealed no bacteria and some sparse growth of yeast.
The patient remains afebrile at this time with no antibiotics with a decreasing white count.
The heparin was discontinued for one hour and resumed at 900 units per hour with a subsequent PTT pending.
The patient's physical examination today, neurologically the patient is very lethargic.
The patient as previously noted been on Celexa due to apparent clinical depression, however, this was discontinued due to decreasing level of responsiveness, increase in lethargy.
Mitral regurgitation status post mitral valve repair.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft times three.
Respiratory failure/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease status post tracheostomy.
Cerebrovascular accident.
Diabetes mellitus.
