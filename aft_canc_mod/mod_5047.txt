Admission Date:  [**2140-4-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2140-4-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2080-8-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Codeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1854**] Chief Complaint: mental status change  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: steriotactic brain biopsy   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 59 y/o female who presented today to an outside hospital after experiencing an increasingly severe headache for the past 4 days.
The patient has had two syncopal events over the past year (most recent episode in early [**Month (only) 958**]).
The patient had an episode of vomiting 4 days ago and has had worsening headache since that time.
The patient's husband notes that the patient has been more somnolent over the past couple days in addition to some gait unsteadiness.
Head CT at the outside hospital demonstrated a significant right frontal brain mass associated with mass effect and shift.
Past Medical History: hypothyroidism, s/p tubal ligation  Social History: works part-time as a hairdresser  Family History: no family history of intracranial malignancy  Physical Exam: A&O x 3.
There is a tiny amount of curvilinear density seen anterior to the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle, which likely represents a small amount of post-procedural hemorrhage.
There is no sign of new or large intracranial hemorrhage.
Vasogenic edema in the right frontal lobe is unchanged.
8-mm leftward subfalcine herniation is largely unchanged.
Right uncal herniation is unchanged.
Status post stereotactic brain biopsy and placement of Ommaya shunt in large cystic lesion in the right frontal lobe.
Unchanged vasogenic edema, leftward subfalcine herniation, and right uncal herniation.
Tiny amount of blood anterior to right lateral ventricle, but no new large intracranial hemorrhage.
MRI head [**4-14**]: FINDINGS: When compared with a prior study, again there is evidence of a large approximately 4 x 5 cm right frontal cystic mass lesion associated with vasogenic edema and subfalcine herniation to the left (approximately 1.2 cm of shifting is noted).
After the administration of gadolinium contrast, there is evidence of ring-enhancing pattern in this lesion with some irregular areas and possible septations.
On the magnetic susceptibility, there are low signal areas suggesting calcifications or blood products.
On FLAIR sequence, there is evidence of some scattered hyperintense foci and possible transependymal migration of CSF on the left occipital ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
There is also evidence of effacement of the right perimesencephalic cisterns and right uncal herniation.
IMPRESSION: Large cystic mass lesion is identified on the right frontal lobe with evidence of ring-enhancing pattern at irregular contour in the base of the lesion with septations and possible hemorrhagic blood products or calcifications.
The possibility of a primary cystic lesion is a consideration, a metastatic lesion cannot be completely ruled out.
