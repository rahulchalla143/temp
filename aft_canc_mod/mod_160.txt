He has recently noticed increased dyspnea on exertion.
Echo earlier this year showed severe aortic stenosis with [**Location (un) 109**] 0.76cm2.
He was referred for a cardiac catheterization which revealed no significant coronary disease and mild aortic stenosis.
He presents now to see if his dyspnea is related to his aortic valve disease and if he should proceed with surgery.
Of note, pulmonary function testing and a chest CT scan were not suggestive of any disease process which may be responsible for his exertional dyspnea.

No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No oovious wall motion abnormalities withl imited Midesophageal suboptimal views.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 410**] was admitted the day before surgery for pre-operative work-up and to be started on Heparin for history of atrial fibrillation.
His couamdin therapy was resumed for atrial fibrillation.
