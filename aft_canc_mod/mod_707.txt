She is now being admitted with 2 days of severe substernal chest pressure associated with left visual floaters and headache although the patient reports her headache has been a chronic issue.
The patient states that her pain is relieved by sitting forward.
There were no recent febrile illnesses and no history of cardiac disease or shortness of breath.
Her EKG did not reveal any evidence of alternans.
A CTA was performed which did not reveal a pulmonary embolus.
Chronic headaches.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for renal cell carcinoma in her mother.
[**Name (NI) **] father had an MI in his 50s.
ALLERGIES:  ASPIRIN, OXYCODONE AND CODEINE--ALL OF WHICH CAUSE NAUSEA AND VOMITING.
Cardiac exam: Regular rate, S1 and S2, no rubs appreciated.
Chest: There are no areas of tenderness upon palpation.
EKG normal sinus rhythm, poor R wave progression, no ST-T wave changes.
No evidence of alternans.
CT angiogram of the chest revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolus or dissection.
On [**6-5**], an MRI revealed a left parapharyngeal infiltrating mass similar to prior study, retention cyst in maxillary sinus, decreased size of left neck mass and fluid collection, abnormal tissue in the left mastoid tip left base of skull near left jugular foramen longus [**Last Name (un) **] muscle.
No intracranial extension.
The patient presented with chest pain and was thought to have evidence of pericarditis either related to a malignant process versus a viral process.
The patient was afebrile upon presentation and did not have any prodrome of a URI leading up to this diagnosis.
Given the fact that her pain was so severe and there was no evidence of myocardial damage, we initiated NSAID treatment as well as prednisone to assist in management of her pain.
A stat echocardiogram was performed which showed early evidence of tamponade-like physiology with a collection of pericardial fluid which appeared to be fibrinous.
Echocardiogram initially showed right atrial diastolic collapse with a pericardial effusion.
The patient developed a fever in this setting to 102.
The patient's symptoms improved dramatically after pericardial window was placed.
The fluid was sent for analysis.
On initial evaluation, it did not appear to be consistent with a malignant effusion.
Fevers, likely secondary to viral and post-XRT     pericarditis.
The patient was afebrile for 48 hours prior     to discharge.
However, the third blood cultures grew 1 out of 4 bottles     positive for gram-positive cocci.
There were no active issues during this     hospitalization.
Pericardial effusion with tamponade-like physiology,     status post pericardial window placement.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was stable without any further chest discomfort and breathing comfortably.
There were no new medications upon discharge.
