Admission Date:  [**2146-9-15**]     Discharge Date:  [**2146-9-28**]  Date of Birth:   [**2088-1-26**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58 year old male with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, status post allo bone marrow transplant in [**2146-4-5**] with a very complicated course.
The patient has had line bacteremia times two in [**Month (only) 205**] and now presents with six to eight weeks' of intermittent progressive rash.
The patient was started on steroids with the belief that the rash was due to graft versus host disease.
In the days prior to admission, the patient is spiking fevers up to 103 and also complains of watery diarrhea.
He also has cough productive of yellow sputum.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia diagnosed in [**2135**], status post allo bone marrow transplant in [**2146-4-5**].
Diabetes mellitus, steroid induced.
General - Alert, ill appearing, in no acute distress.
Dry mucous membranes.
The neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular is tachycardic, hyperdynamic, no murmurs.
The lungs revealed wet crackles bilaterally.
Extremities revealed 1+ pitting edema.
Skin is diffusely erythematous and desquamating.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was initially admitted to the regular medical floor with fevers and watery diarrhea.
He received fluids with no significant improvement.
He also had some broad spectrum antibiotics including Cefepime, Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
On the medical floor, the patient continued to have worsening hypoxia which was not improving despite numerous medical interventions.
He was then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit after he developed hemoptysis and hypoxia with oxygen saturation unable to improve on noninvasive ventilation.
Initial gases revealed acidosis with mild hypercapnia and good oxygenation.
His presumptive diagnosis was diffuse overall hemorrhage based on the fact that he is a post bone marrow transplant patient and on his hemoptysis.
He did not improve after four days of non- invasive mask ventilation with at times worsening hypoxia and hypercapnia.
He was maintained on all antibiotics and no clear source of infection was identified.
On [**2146-9-28**], the patient developed an episode of hypotension that was not responding to fluids.
He became hypoxic and required increased FIO2 to 100.
Despite repeated fluid boluses, he went profoundly hypotensive and his mental status was declining.
