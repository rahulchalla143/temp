Admission Date:  [**2184-4-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2184-4-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2147-12-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12**] Chief Complaint: Hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 85785**] is a very nice 36 year-old gentleman with history of smoking and hemoptysis who was recently diagnosed with a mediastinal mass who presented with hemoptysis.
He had been well in his prior state of health until ~3 months ago when he started with cough and feeling upper back and left shoulder pain that occasionally went down his left arm and to his fingers.
He also reported feeling dizzy on occasion but did not relate that to any position or certain movement.
He had been having dry cough since then but over the past 2 weeks started noting occasional blood streaked sputum once or twice in the am and later would not have any more hemoptysis.
He presented to [**Hospital3 934**] Hospital where he was admitted on [**3-22**] and discharged on [**3-25**] and during that period he had a CT guided biopsy of the mass with the results inconclusive but showing malignant cells suggestive of carcinoma vs germ cell tumor.
He estimates a total of around 15 ml from all episodes of hemoptysis over the previous day, with the amount each time and frequency stable.
He denied having had any further episodes of hemoptysis since presenting to the ED.
He also had noted 2 days prior a transient sharp pain in his left mid chest that he can point to with 3 fingers.
He had slightly decreased breath sounds in the lower left of his chest.
There was no wheezing.
His ECG showed sinus tachycardia at 120 BPM without any signs of ischemia.
His labs were significant for a microcytic normochromic anemia with HCT of 36.
He underwent a CT-PE, which showed a small PE in left upper lobe segmental artery.
The mass in the upper mediastinum was visualized measuring 14x5 cm aprox and was compressing the pulmonary artery.
His CT scan of his head showed no acute intracranial process.
IP was consulted in regards to management of PE in a patient with a mediastinal mass and they recommended gentle anticoagulation with heparin gtt and possible rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy after admission.
Past Medical History: - Smoking - Superior mediastinal mass s/p CT-guided biopsy with - undetermined path GERD - History of having a cut wound and bacteremia afterwards when he was a kid  Social History: He lives in [**Location 1439**], MA.
Family History: His maternal uncle had lung cancer and was a smoker, his paternal grandmother had lung cancer and was not a smoker, his paternal aunt had breast cancer.
Physical Exam: VITAL SIGNS - Temp 99 F, BP 127/76 mmHg, HR 108 BPM, RR 13 X', O2-sat 94% RA <br> GENERAL - well-appearing man in NAD, comfortable, appropriate, not jaundiced (skin, mouth, conjuntiva) HEENT - NC/AT, PERRLA, EOMI, sclerae anicteric, MMM, OP clear NECK - supple, no thyromegaly, no JVD, no carotid bruits, left lymphadenopathy of ~3 cm, movile LUNGS - Bibasilary crackles, no r/rh/wh, good air movement, resp unlabored, no accessory muscle use HEART - PMI non-displaced, RRR, no MRG, nl S1-S2 ABDOMEN - NABS, soft/NT/ND, no masses or HSM, no rebound/guarding.
EXTREMITIES - WWP, no c/c/e, 2+ peripheral pulses (radials, DPs), clubbing present SKIN - no rashes or lesions LYMPH - no cervical, axillary, or inguinal LAD NEUROLOGIC: Mental status: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam, normal affect.
Extraocular movements intact bilaterally, no nystagmus.
Palate elevation symmetrical.
Small filling defect within the left upper lobe segmental pulmonary artery, concerning for pulmonary embolus.
Extensive large left paramediastinal mass lesion which markedly attenuates and encases the left main pulmonary artery.
Moderate left pleural effusion with paraseptal emphysematous changes.
Left lower lobe atelectasis.
Focal patchy opacity in the left lingula may represent a superimposed infectious process vs. tumor involvement.
Prominent left retrocrural lymph node.
Lucency within the sternum with a sclerotic border.
Given the patient's history of lung cancer, bone scan may be performed for further evaluation or correlation with PET-CT.  CT Head w/o contrast: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Mild sinus disease.
MRI Head: IMPRESSION: No evidence of metastatic disease to the head.
Retrocrural and celiac lymphadenopathy, no other evidence of disease in the abdomen and pelvis.
Partially imaged large left pleural effusion  FNA, Left Mediastinal: Left mediastinal: Poorly differentiated carcinoma, see note.
Overall, the morphologic and immunohistochemical findings are suggestive of a poorly differentiated primary lung carcinoma, possibly with squamous differentiation.
Note: The biopsy is comprised of tiny fragments of fibrous tissue being infiltrated by malignant epithelioid cells.
Overall, the morphologic and immunohistochemical findings are most suggestive of a poorly differentiated carcinoma, possibly of lung origin, given the TTF-1 expression.
However, the significance of the reported p63 and SALL4 positivity is unclear, and a thymic carcinoma or germ cell neoplasm cannot be entirely excluded.
There is loss of disc height at C3-4 with endplate sclerosis and anterior and posterior osteophytes.
There are mild degenerative changes at the remainder of the levels.
There is prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
There is mild uncovertebral narrowing at all levels.
He was initially restarted on heparin gtt post-bronchoscopy per IP recs, but this was stopped the following morning given the setting of recent hemoptysis and concern that pulmonary clot occurred secondary to structural process related to mediastinal mass rather than systemic coagulopathy.
During his MICU stay, he was alert and oriented with throat pain post-bronch as his major complaint.
SQUAMOUS CELL LUNG CANCER: Upon transfer to the OMED service, patient was noted to be in sinus tachycardia to the 110s to 140s and normotensive requiring 4L NC for sats in the 90s.
Imaging obtained as above showed large lung/mediastinal mass measuring 17.8 x 5.7 x 14.3 cm causing mass effect with shift of mediastinal structures to the right.
The mass encased the left main pulmonary artery and markedly narrowed it causing a central filling defect within the left upper lobe segmental pulmonary artery.
Given this large mass and no evidence of clot burden systemically, it was felt this was a pulmonary thrombus, not an embolus.
Given his continued hemoptysis, it was again felt the risk of bleeding from systemic anticoagulation was higher than the benefit.
CT Abd/Pelvis showed LAD in the celiac and retrocrural axis.
Given these findings along with biopsy results consistent with squamous cell carcinoma, it was felt patient was at least Stage 3A SCCA Lung CA, however given the patient's pleural effusion and possible LAD below the diaphragm, patient's staging may be higher.
During his treatment course, patient's hemoptysis improved from several teaspoons per hour to [**2-11**] teaspoons per day.
He no longer needed supplemental oxygen and his tachycardia improved ranging from 80s to low 100s.
PAIN CONTROL: Patient initially complained of pleuritic chest pain which was controlled on po dilaudid.
During his chemo/radiation he began to complain of posterior neck/left shoulder/scapular pain.
He had a normal neurological exam without weakness in his upper extremities.
Plain films of cervical area and shoulder did not show any obvious cause of his pain.
Pain was felt to be due to large tumor burden along with XRT.
