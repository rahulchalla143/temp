Admission Date:  [**2132-4-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-5-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2087-1-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2712**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory distress   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 86946**] is a 45 year old gentleman with stage 4 tracheal SCC s/p cisplatin/etoposide, docetaxel, XRT, tracheal stenting x2, cryotherapy via debulking found to have a TE fistula now admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress.
Over the course of today, the patient developed increasing shortness of breath at rest, worsening chronic cough productive of green/yellowish sputum, increasing fatigue, and a subjective fever with a recorded temperature of 99.9 oral.
He had previously had tracheal stents placed in [**11-18**] and [**12-19**], and was found to have a TE fistula in [**3-21**] on barium swallow.
He had a CXR that demonstrated possible left base consolidation.
Timeline --[**8-/2131**] presented with hoarseness to ENT.
Fiberoptic nasopharyngolaryngoscopy demonstrating a right true vocal cord paralysis; subsequent CT scan of neck/chest revealed a large paratracheal mass.
-- [**2131-9-24**] underwent rigid bronchoscopy with tumor excision and endobronchial biopsy; pathology revealed poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.
-- [**2131-11-21**] PET scan showed irregular right posterior tracheal mass with extension into the tracheal lumen.
EUS [**2131-11-28**] suggested tumor invasion of the esophagus with enlargement of 3 paraesophageal lymph nodes.
-- [**2131-12-4**] admitted to ICU from clinic for urgent RT for progressive dyspnea and urgent flexible bronchoscopy which revealed extrinsic compression of the stent to 50% diameter and tumor spread down the distal trachea.
-- [**2131-12-6**] began RT for planned 5400cGy -- [**2131-12-7**] C1D1 Cisplatin/Etoposide similar to SWOG regimen for IIIA/B NSCLC -- [**2131-12-11**] percutaneous gastrostomy placed -- [**2131-12-18**] admitted with fever to 103 after 1750cGy, on Vanc/Cef/Mica.
It was noted then that there was 3 cm of distal tumor spread towards the carina from the preexisting stent.
-- [**2131-12-24**] completed 2600 of planned 5400cGy -- [**2131-12-25**] Chest CT: with unchanged tracheal findings and interval resolution of some GGO in the lung.
-- [**2131-12-28**] Docetaxel 75mg/m2, progression after Cis-Etop -- [**2132-1-14**] Completed 5400cGy RT to upper airway -- [**2132-1-30**] repeat bronch with patent stent and no endobronchial lesions.
-- [**2132-3-3**] CT neck with interval decrease in size of the posterior tracheoesophageal groove mass compared to prior.
-- [**2132-3-24**] Bronch with distal tumor growth, biopsy confimred recurrent poorly differentiated carcinoma.
Cryotherapy tumor debulking.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - GERD - Right Coles fracture corrected by ORIF, [**2128**] - No prior medical hospitalizations   Social History: Patient was born in the [**Country 13622**] Republic but moved to the US in [**2116**].
There are low lung volumes.
There has been apparent interval increase in bilateral ground-glass opacities.
Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity is seen which may be due to atelectasis, although infection and/or aspiration is not excluded.
There is slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may be due to overlying atelectasis or small consolidation, small trace effusion cannot be excluded.
No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
Interval enlargement of a tracheal mass with extensive extratracheal extension posteriorly and [**Last Name (un) **] near total occlusion of the tracheal lumen below the lower margin of the metallic stent.
New right laryngocele.
Enlargement of prevascular, precarinal, right hilar and subcarinal lymph nodes since [**2132-3-3**].
Bilateral lower lobe and right upper lobe pneumonia and bronchiolitis, likely due to aspiration.
Presence of gas within the retrotracheal mass at the upper margin of the stent raises the possibility of localized perforation, a potential stent complication.
Differential diagnosis includes necrosis/secondary infection of the retrotracheal mass and iatrogenic (if recent biopsy).
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 86946**] is a 45 year old gentleman with stage 4 tracheal SCC s/p cisplatin/etoposide, docetaxel, XRT, tracheal stent x2, cryotherapy debulking found to have a TE fistula now admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress.
Respiratory status: Hypoxemic respiratory distress in setting of terminal tracheal SCC and TE fistula, with CT trachea demosntrating worsening tumor progression.
Patient treated empirically with vanco, pip/tazo, and cipro, which was converted to levofloxacin for a 7 day course on discharge.
