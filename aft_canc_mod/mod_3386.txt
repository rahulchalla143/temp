Admission Date:  [**2197-12-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2197-12-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2131-1-16**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**] Chief Complaint: AMS, s/p fall  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 55623**] is a 66 yo female with hx of stage IV NSCLC dx in [**2-26**] with known liver mets who presents to ED with AMS s/p fall at home.
Ms. [**Known lastname 55623**] completed 3 cycles of chemotherapy with Carboplatinum and Taxol for metastatic non small cell lung cancer, with both objective and subjective response.
Her right upper quadrant pain and fullness from her liver metastases disappeared, her CEA dropped significantly and a CAT scan confirmed shrinkage of tumor.
However, more recently she developed extreme fatigue presumably from this regimen, and was switched over to Navelbine, we she started on [**2197-11-30**].
The patient was tolerating the new regimen well until 1d PTA, when she began "feeling well over," with nausea, vomiting four times since yesterday, weakness and occasional dizziness.
She had a CT scan of her head performed, which showed a rounded focus in the high left parietal lobe which was concerning for a metastatic lesion.
NSCLC - dx [**2-26**] with known liver mets 2.
HTN 3.
Anxiety  Social History: Lives with her paternal aunt age [**Age over 90 **], she is able to carry out all ADLs, cooks for them both; stopped smoking with dx of lung cancer in [**4-28**].

Areas of low attenuation in the periventricular white matter are consistent with chronic microvascular infarcts.
A more rounded focus in the high left parietal lobe may also represent a small infarct, however, in a patient with known metastatic disease, a metastatic lesion cannot be excluded.
There is no associated mass effect.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Low attenuation foci which likely represent chronic microvascular infarcts, however, metastatic lesions cannot be excluded.
Gadolinium enhanced MRI can be performed for evaluation for metastatic disease.
Right cerebellar calcifications without associated mass effect of uncertain etiology.

AMS: hyponatremia vs. new brain mets.
She was hyponatremic on admission (?
MRI of the brain showed bilateral occipital changes consistent with reversible encephalopathy of unclear etiology with no evidence of brain metastases.
Neurology was consulted and felt that she did not necessarily have this encephalopathy and required no further imaging or treatment.
E. coli Urosepsis:  Although initially afebrile and hemodynamically stable, she became febrile, hypotensive, and was found to have [**2-26**] blood cultures growing E. Coli on [**2196-12-20**] (presumed urinary source).
She was in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] briefly, started on Levofloxacin and gentamicin (to double cover for gram negatives; E. coli was sensitive to these antibiotics), and she defervesced, became hemodynamically stable.
She remained afebrile and stable after the addition of this antibiotic, and she will complete a 10-day course of both the levofloxacin and vancomycin.
She was bolused as necessary (with good response) for symptomatic hypotension.
Nutrition: she had poor PO intake while in-house and was followed by nutrition.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg IV Q4-6H:PRN anxiety or nausea/vomiting 15.
Change in Mental status 4.
Thrombocytopenia Secondary Diagnoses: 1.

Please call your PCP if you are experiencing chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, fever, or with any other concerns.
