During that admission, she had LP with CSF findings of elevated protein with negative protein electrophoresis (no oligoclonal banding) and negative flow cytometry for malignant cells.
She also had negative beta-2-microglobulin, CEA, LDH, ACE, routine culture, AFB stain, gram stain, cryptococcal antigen, and HSV.
During this admissiom, she had conservative management with pain control with Dilaudid and Tylenol and anti-emetics with Zofran and Compazine.
