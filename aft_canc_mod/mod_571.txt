Admission Date:  [**2182-5-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2182-5-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2124-3-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Dilantin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2182-5-8**] LEFT OCCIPITAL CRANI FOR MASS   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 14696**] is a 58 year old male with a PMH significant for HTN, HLD, DM 2, and 40+ pack year smoking history admitted for weakness found to have lung and brain masses.
The patient reports that he was in his usual state of health until 1 day prior to admission, at which point he had acute onset of weakness while walking with his wife.
[**Name (NI) **] describes this an an inability to stay standing last for several minutes, after which he felt unsteady but was able to walk home independently.
The patient was had a CXR that demonsrated a right perihilar spiculated mass, and a CTH that demonstrated extensive left parietal lobe vasogenic edema.
States that he has a [**1-6**] right sided headache described as right temple pressure.
ROS is notable for several months of fatigue, unchanged dyspnea on exertion, and a stutter that is worse than baseline over the past several months.
Past Medical History: - Normal MIBI in [**2178**], though echo shows small area of akinesis - HTN - HLD - DM 2 - COPD (emphysema) - GERD/Barrett's esophagus - Elevated PSA s/p normal biopsy in [**2175**] - Childhood seizure disorder - last event at 11 or 12 years of age - Anxiety/trouble with anger management, on Risperdal - Learning disability - Multiple hernias - Glaucoma bilaterally - Strabismus - Tonsillectomy - Umbilical hernia repair - Right inguinal hernia repair - "Eye operation" at 6-8 years of age because "I was seeing double"  Social History: Married.
Family History: Very strong family history of lung cancer in mother, grandparents, and multiple aunts&uncles.
CV: Nl S1+S2 Pulm: CTAB, no wheezes Abd: S/NT/ND +bs Rectal: OB brown negative (per ED) Ext: No c/c/e.
LAD: No cervical, submental, posterior auricular, supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy.
Speech notable for stutter, no slurring.
Heterogeneous enhancing lesions in the left parasagittal parieto-occipital lobe and the left cerebellum, with susceptibility artifacts and extensive left parietal parenchymal edema.
The constellation of findings is compatible with hemorrhagic brain metastasis with vasogenic edema.
In the clinical context of a spiculated pulmonary mass, this is highly suggestive of squamous cell carcinoma metastasis with hemorrhagic components.
No hydrocephalus or significant midline shift.
Right lower lobe mass consistent with primary bronchogenic neoplasm.
Equivocal lymph nodes are identified in the contralateral mediastinum.
No evidence of hepatic metastases.
A tiny right adrenal nodule is too small to characterize.
Post-surgical changes, with hemorrhage in the resection cavity, but no definite evidence of residual or recurrent neoplasm.
Small punctate focus of decreased diffusion in the posterior left parietal lobe, and deep to the resection cavity, may represent a tiny infarct versus cytotoxic edema.
Stable enhancement and intrinsic T1 hyperintense foci in the left cerebellar hemisphere, also likely representing metastatic disease, and unchanged since the prior study.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 14696**] is a 58 year old male with a PMH significant for HTN, HLD, DM 2, and 40+ pack year smoking history admitted for weakness found to have lung and brain masses.
# Weakness: Almost definitely due to malignancy and brain masses.
Given the patient's significant tobacco/smoking history, right perihilar mass concerning for primary lung neoplasm, specifically squamous cell lung cancer, with brain metastasis, although cannot rule out another primary at this time.
Chief complaint of weakness in the setting of subtle neurologic findings as detailed by Neurology also concerning in setting of left parietal vasogenic edema.
Given his history of a Dilantin as a child, he was started on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
# DM 2: His Glipizide and Actos/Metformin forumulation were held.
# COPD: Respiratory status stable without hypoxemia.
After speaking with the patient and his outpatient case manager, it was felt that he was competent to make his own medical decisions.
His pain was well controlled and his neurological exam remained unchanged.
He remained inhouse until discharge plans could be coordinated with the hospital social worker and his personal social worker.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever, headache.
You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.

Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.
Loss of vision, either partial or total.
Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.
Severe sensitivity to light.
Severe headache or change in headache.
Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
