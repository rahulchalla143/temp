On the weekend prior to admission the patient developed a distended abdomen.
One day prior to admission he developed noticeable jaundice.
He also experienced a distended abdomen, but was able to have a bowel movement while at [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital.
Studies at [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital were an ultrasound, which revealed trace ascites, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, spleen of greater then 20 cm, enlarged gallbladder with sludge and wall thickening, peripancreatic and periportal lymphadenopathy and increased size in the kidneys.
On [**2151-7-16**] CT of the abdomen revealed ascites, bilateral pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, abdominal anasarca and no small bowel obstruction.
[**2151-7-22**] a barium enema showed a normal colon without obstruction.
Neck examination there is a mobile, rubbery, supraclavicular lymph node.
No jugulovenous distention noted.
2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border.
Chest decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion at both bases.
Abdomen was quite distended and tympanic.
However, the finding was not clear due to the distended abdomen.
Extremities were 2+ pitting edema to the ankles bilaterally.
There were purple patches resembling Kaposi sarcoma on the shins bilaterally.
Kaposi sarcoma diagnosed in [**2142**] with extension to the legs, stomach, rectum and lymph nodes.
Hepatitis C and colonic obstruction and a questionable PCP diagnosed back in [**2150-10-29**].
Maternal grandmother had lung cancer and dad had melanoma.
Urinalysis showed large blood and bilirubin.
[**2151-7-12**] echocardiogram showed no vegetation.
[**2151-7-12**] esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a Zenker ring.
Hematology:  The patient remained pancytopenic and anemic despite 2 units of packed red blood cell transfusion.
At this time heme/onc was consulted and they felt that the anemia is most likely due to hemophagocytosis.
We will continue with blood transfusion in the MICU and consider possibility of splenic embolization.
Pulmonary:  The patient's saturation on 4 liters of oxygen became worse and dropped off from the 97%.
It was felt that this was likely secondary to the profound anemia.
Arterial blood gas showed respiratory alkalosis so the patient was transferred to the MICU where he was intubated.
Chest x-ray during this hospitalization showed no infiltrate, but revealed some bilateral pleural effusion and pericardial effusion.
regarding the pericardial effusions found on CT of the chest and chest x-ray the patient would have been considered for an echocardiogram and drain if overall conditions merits aggressive therapy.
Also the patient became quite short of breath and started experiencing respiratory alkalosis.
