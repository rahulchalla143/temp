Suctioned, with trach changes without succes, still difficulty with diminished R sided lung sounds.
Pt given vanc, ceftax, flagl and was placed on levphed gtt to maps>60.
ID history: She was found to have pan-sensitive TB on 3 drug regimen (INH/ETH/PZA).
[**12-16**] had right VATS, right supraclavic LN, and liver biopsy done Biopsy shows granuloma suspicious for infectious process.
Trial of ambisome; no effect.
Has had loculated effusions but now no fluid; tapping them the first time showed no growth on cx; the second time there was no fluids.
She had [**12-25**] Bcx with coag neg staph seen on [**1-17**] with no subsequent growth to date.
Rec'd empiric Vanco tx with f/up TEE (TTE from [**12-31**] was without vegetations) .
ROS was unobtainable due to mental status.
Past Medical History: -Pulm TB (pan sensitive) with liver/spleen granulomas s/p R sided vats, r supraclavic LN, liver bx + -h/o +PPD w/o tx -AFB on BAL [**2147-1-2**] -tx continious since 2/1 per prior dc summ -1)Diabetes mellitus - diet controlled 2)OSA - on BiPAP 12/8 3)Cataract in the left eye 4)CVA/TIA (positive MRI) - right frontal with L arm/hand hemiparesis; etiology likely moderate degree stenosis of the ICA  in the cavernous region, stable on recent CTA 5)Asthma 6)Hypercholesterolemia 7)Seizure- uncertain diagnosis - L arm involuntary movements [**2144**] 8)Recent colonoscopy in [**2144**] with single sessile 4-5 mm non-bleeding polyp of benign appearance, s/p removal.
mammography yearly unremarkable.
[**Name (NI) **] brother with possible lung cancer.
HEENT: NCAT, PERRL, EOMI, no scleral icterus, MMM, stoma closed with vaseline gauze, but persistent air leak.
Abdomen: soft, NT, ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted Extremities: 1+ edema bilat.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Heb Reb Micro Data: [**5-27**] Sputum - pseudomonas sensitive to cefepime, resistant to carbapenems .
[**5-30**] CXR - Improved pulmonary aeration, with persistent right basilar opacity, likely residual consolidation.
Minimal blunting left CP angle.
Interval worsening of bilateral airspace opacities, predominantly within the right lower lobe which would  be consistent with worsened pneumonia.
Stable mediastinal and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy consistent with history of tuberculosis.
10 mm hyperdense cyst in the midpole of the right kidney, likely hemorrhage into a cyst.
The mild pulmonary edema persists, right more than left.
No appreciable change demonstrated in the parenchymal opacities.
Small pleural effusion is unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 72F h/o CVA, disseminated TB presents with hemoptysis and failure to ventillate, VAP, septic shock.
#Septic shock: Hypotension, tachycardia, fever likely due to ventilatory associated pneumonia (see below).
#Pulmonary: Respiratory failure - Due to mechanical failure, tracheomalacia resulting in tracheostomy tube obstruction.
At presentation, unable to ventilate with bloody secretions out ot the ET tube due to trach osbruction with granulation tissue.
Also became significantly volume overloaded after fluid resuscitation due to hypotension and was diuresed successfully but continued to require mechanical ventilation due to occasional apnea and serially poor RSBIs.
Respiratory muscle weakness vs. central cause due to prior CVA and brain injury.
Continued ventilatory support with AC or MMV as tolerated.
VAP (resistant pseudomonas) - Colonized chronically with multiple resistent pseudomonas bacteria.
Increased sputum at presentation with septic physiology requiring pressors.
Disseminated TB - Pulmonary TB with liver/spleen granulomas s/p R VATs; diagnosed [**12-28**] and has been on a regimen of ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrizinamide as she could not tolerate a 4-drug regimen.
Given her new pulmonary symptoms, she was r/o for active pulmonary TB with three negative sputum AFB smears.
ID: h/o multiple VAPs with ESBL ecoli and MDR pseudomonas.
Also with h/o VRE from urine and dissemintated TB.
However, tobramycin was stopped 2 days early for concern of worsening renal function.
Differential included infection (although being treated with pathogen-directed antibiotic), medications, transfusion reaction, MDS/AML, or central cause.
No evidence of vegetation on TEE during last admission and given that blood cultures remained negative an endovascular source seemed less likely.
Heme-onc was consulted as patient has underlying MDS with borderline AML transformation, but they did not believe that her fevers were due to her underlying hematologic disorder.
Renal: Acute prerenal failure which resovled rapidly with intravenous fluids.
No further renal failure and creatinine was at baseline 0.8-1.0 until just prior to discharge.
Hypernatermia: Patient with slightly elevated sodium secondary to free water deficit.
Neuro: h/o R ICA watershed infarct with residual L hemiparesis and aphasia.
Mental status became depressed in the setting of infection, but improved on [**6-7**] to near baseline with antibiotics.
Heme-Onc: -Pancytopenia - h/o MDS with bone marrow Bx revealing borderline transformation to AML.
Heme-onc was consulted, but based on stable pancytopenia and no peripheral blasts, there was no evidence progression of disease.
Weekly differential should be followed to evaluate for evidence of blasts.
-Anemia - Combination of MDS and chronic hemolysis due to multiple blood transfusions.
DAT weakly positive initially due to elevated IgG, but a repeat test was negative.
# GI: patient continue on tube feeds and tolerated them well, however with free water bolus patient had vomiting with this.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol [**Month/Day (4) **]: 6-8 Puffs Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for wheezing/SOB.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 672**] Hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: 1. disseminated tuberculosis 2. former right ICA stroke with residual left hemiparesis 3.
