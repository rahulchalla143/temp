The pain continued to worsen and became more diffuse with enlargement of his abdomen.
The pain is now severe and [**8-29**].
It was associated with nausea, vomiting.
It was not associated with diarrhea, constipation, dysuria or hematuria.
It was not associated with lightheadedness or dizziness.
He underwent a CT scan with IV contrast which showed a large amount of new perihepatic hemorrhage with evidence for active extravasation at site of previous liver capsular rupture.
Moderate amount of abdominal pelvic hemorrhage.
New segment VIII low attenuation concerning for metastasis.
Increased metstatic disease burden in left lobe.
No distant metastasis.
He was seen by the surgical consult service who recommended that he undergo emergent IR embolization of bleeding region.
He continued to note pain in his abdomen.
He endorses pain with deep inspiration and mild dyspnea.
He denies nausea, vomiting, dysuria, hematuria, lightheadedness, dizziness, melena, hematochezia, leg pain or swelling.
Now he is transfered to the OMED service to further management of his bleeding and to discuss treatment options.

EKG: sinus tachycardia at 101, left axis deviation, left anterior fascicular block, no acute ST segment changes.
Imaging: CXR:  Lung volumes are mildly diminished.
No consolidation or edema is noted.
A small hiatal hernia is incidentally noted.
No effusion or pneumothorax or free intraperitoneal air identified.
Increase in the extent of metastatic disease, likely hepatocellular carcinoma, involving the left lobe of the liver and evidence of capsular rupture and large volume of hemoperitoneum.
A new 8 mm hypoattenuating focus within the right lobe of the liver is now seen.
An area of increased attenuation within the center of the hemoperitoneum adjacent to the liver is concerning for active extravasation.
Moderate hiatal hernia.
Left renal cyst.

Hemoperitoneum:  Patient with evidence of active extravasation of contrast on abdominal CT scan and calculated peritoneal fluid hematocrit of 18.
His pain was controlled with IV dilaudid and then switched to an oral regimen.
Hypotension/Hemorrhagic Shock:  Related to acute blood loss in the setting of hemoperitoneum.
Acute Renal Failure:  Patient's creatinine upon presentation was 1.5 and improved up to 0.6 upon discharge after IVF and stopping hemorrhage.
It was thought to be pre-renal renal failure since patient improved rapidly and there were no cast suggesting ATN.
Hyperglycemia:  No documented history of hyperglycemia but blood glucose on chemistry panel is 238.
He had minimal requirements during hospitalization.
He now bleed into the abdomen and most likely has metastatic disease (not proven).
Do not drive or do high risk activities.
Lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO once a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: All Care VNA of Greater [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Abdominal Hemhorrage secondary to hepatocelular carcinoma.
Secondary Diagnosis: Hepatocellular Carcinoma Hepatitis C Cirrhosis HIV   Discharge Condition: Stable, tolerating PO, pain controlled, ambulating.
Discharge Instructions: You were seen at the [**Hospital1 18**] for abdominal pain.
You had a CT scan of your abdomen that showed signs of bleeding.
