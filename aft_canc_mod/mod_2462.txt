ECHO [**2188-9-18**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2188-8-22**], there is no pericardial effusion on the current study (the prior study mentioned an effusion but this appearance may have been due to a fat pad).

No DVT in the right lower extremity.
The patient is status post resection of right frontal lobe meningioma, with severe encephalomalacia in the surgical site.
There is persistent small foci of pneumocephalus, and hyperdensity within the right frontal lobe, that was felt to represent likely subacute hemorrhage.
There is a stable small extra-axial hyperdense collection overlying the right frontal lobe.
No new hemorrhage, shift of midline structures or vascular territory infarct is identified.
Periventricular and deep white matter hypodensities, consistent with small vessel disease are stable.
There is a soft tissue density within the right frontal lobe that is unchanged.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are otherwise well aerated.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of post-surgical changes, with hyperdensity in the right frontal lobe resection bed.
No new mass effect or hemorrhage.
IMPRESSION: Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.

Patient had recent neurosurgery [**2188-8-21**].
Patient still having persistent A-Fib after pacer placement.
Pt became hypotensive most likely from increasing dose of beta blocker.
Since then he has been at a constant rate of 80 with no events on telemetry.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS demonstrated extensive left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis extending from the common femoral to the calf veins.
No DVT in the right lower extremity.
# Urinary tract infection: Developed hematuria.
Ua demonstrated signs of infection (+ nitrates + leukocytes, 11 WBC, moderate bacteria).
# Paraphimosis: Developed [**2188-9-20**] and immediately reduced by Urology.

We treated like a TIA and started him on high dose statin.
# Hypothyroidism: TSH and free T4 checked on last admission.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for a fast, irregular heart rate.
On admission we found you had a blood clot in your left leg.
