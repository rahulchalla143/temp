She was seen in heme/onc clinic today to start C2D1 of PTK/Taxol protocol and was noted to become unresponsive during a meeting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
She had been having declining functional status over the past couple of weeks with chemotherapy having refractory symptoms of nausea and pain, followed by palliative care service.
Past Medical History: Oncologic History: Pancreatic Cancer: Pt developed abdominal pain in [**6-7**], and CT scan showed multiple nodules in her lungs, most of which were located in a perivascular distribution.
There was also a hypoattenuating lesion in the dome of the right lobe of the liver, which measured about 9 mm x 12 mm; but most importantly, there was identified in the uncinate process of the pancreas at 2.7 x 3.6 cm hypoattenuating mass that was highly suspicious for an adenocarcinoma.
This mass was found to encase the SMA and was also associated with occlusion of SMV as it passes through the mass.
The patient was initiated on weekly gemcitabine therapy (from [**Date range (1) 73037**]/07)and for unclear reasons had episodes of neurological disturbances which required admission to the hospital.
