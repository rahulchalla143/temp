The patient was reportedly in his normal state of health until approximately 1 month ago, when he developed a cough and fever and presented to his PCP.
He presented to the hospital a few days later, at which time he was admitted to from [**Date range (1) 58377**] for fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia.
His LFTs also increased during this admission to the [**2133**], so he had a liver Bx, which was consistent with either drug effect or acute infection.
Since his discharge on [**12-30**], Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) **] states that he continues to have daily fevers to 102, which typically resolve with Tylenol.
He finished his course of antibiotics, and his PICC line was pulled without complication on [**1-13**].
Of note, he does endorse a non-productive cough at night with associated pain in his right ribs.
He also has had frequent pruritic rashes on his legs, trunk and back of his hands since [**Month (only) 1096**].
He had a CXR that was negative for PNA and he was given IVFs.
On the floor, the patient states that overall he was feeling run down but otherwise has no new complaints.
Patient continued to be febrile overnight, complains of dry mouth and dry hacking cough which keeps him awake.

A large number of retroperitoneal, mesenteric, pelvic and inguinal lymph nodes are present, many which are mildly enlarged by CT criteria.
These findings are consistent with patient's HIV positive status; however, given diffuse nature of lymphadenopathy, lymphoma should be considered and additional differential considerations and opportunistic infections cannot be entirely excluded.
SUPRACLAVICULAR LYMPH NODE BIOPSY [**2144-1-18**] -HIGH-GRADE B-CELL LYMPHOMA, BEST CLASSIFIED AS LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA ARISING IN A BACKGROUND OF MULTICENTRIC CASTLEMAN'S DISEASE (MCD), SEE NOTE.
Bilateral small pleural effusions with associated atelectasis, right greater than left.
5-mm right upper lobe pulmonary nodule for which a six-month followup chest CT is advised.
CXR [**2144-1-22**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2143-12-30**] through [**1-20**]: Elevation of the lung bases is probably due to component of small pleural effusions and basal atelectasis.
Partially collapsed gallbladder with wall thickening; features do not suggest acute cholecystitis.
Again, the wall thickening is likely secondary to hypoalbuminemia, but may also represent CHF, underlying hepatitis, or HIV cholangiopathy.
No biliary dilatation is seen.
Right pleural effusion.
SKIN PUNCH BIOPSY LEFT CHEST [**2144-2-9**] Dermal vascular proliferation consistent with Kaposi's sarcoma (see note).
Note: Immunohistochemical stains for D2-40 and HHV-8 are positive within the lesion, consistent with the above diagnosis.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 58376**] is a 45y/o gentleman with recently diagnosed HIV/AIDS, who presented with a one-month history of fevers, dry cough and anemia.
He was found to have HHV-8(+) Multicentric Castleman's disease with diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
Multicentric Castleman's disease with Diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
Bone marrow and lymph node biopsies confirmed that he has plasmablastic lymphoma in the setting of HHV-8(+) Castleman's Disease.
He was treated with 1 cycle of modified R-[**Hospital1 **] (steroids, Rituximab, Bortezomib, Vincristine, Cyclophosphamide, and Doxorubicin): [**2144-1-24**]: started Dexamethasone 20mg PO daily (decreased to 10mg PO daily) [**2144-1-31**]: Rituximab 710 mg IV (375 mg/m2) [**2144-2-8**]: Rituximab 710 mg IV (375 mg/m2) [**2144-2-10**]: Bortezomib 2.4mg IV (1.3 mg/m2) [**2144-2-13**]: Cyclophosphamide 1340 mg IV (750 mg/m2), Doxorubicin 4 mg IV (2.5 mg/m2), Vincristine 0.4 mg IV (0.2 mg/m2), changed from Dexamethasone to PredniSONE 100 mg PO [**2144-2-14**]: Doxorubicin 4 mg IV (2.5 mg/m2), Vincristine 0.4 mg IV (0.2 mg/m2), PredniSONE 100 mg PO [**2144-2-15**]: no chemo [**2144-2-16**]: no chemo [**2144-2-17**]: Doxorubicin 8 mg IV (5 mg/m2), Vincristine 0.4 mg IV (0.2 mg/m2), PredniSONE 100 mg PO [**2144-2-18**]: Doxorubicin 8 mg IV (5 mg/m2), Vincristine 0.4 mg IV (0.2 mg/m2), PredniSONE 100 mg PO He tolerated the chemotherapy well without significant side effects.
When he was clinically stable on the floor, he was started on Truvada/Raltegravir per ID recs (dual therapy for HBV and HIV), on [**2144-2-11**].
# Hepatitis B: prior infection without evidence of active or latent infection.
# HHV-8/Kaposi's sarcoma: HHV-8 is likely a factor that contributes to his Multicentric Castleman's Disease.
In addition, he has skin lesions that were concerning for Kaposi's sarcoma and biopsy by Dermatology has confirmed this diagnosis.
Treatment of Kaposi's will be similar to treatment of lymphoma; at this point priority lies on lymphoma treatment.
# Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia: multifactorial, resolving.
On last admission he had transaminitis to the [**2133**]'s, which resolved and AST/ALT were ~50.
CT scan showed edematous gallbladder but ultrasound without gallstones.
However, it is likely that his liver disease was due to infiltration by his MCD/lymphoma.
T. bili peaked at 20 during this admission and the patient had significant jaundice/icterus, but as he improved it downtrended and was 2.5 at the time of discharge and he had no more icterus or jaundice.
He may have an outpatient MRCP to assess the degree of infiltrative disease in his liver.
# Thrombocytopenia: possibly from bone marrow infiltration as well as chemotherapy.
The team considered infection and drug effect from Meropenem; HIT Ab was negative and there was no evidence of TTP or hemolysis.
They concluded that he likely had bone marrow infiltration from his underlying disease.
# Anemia: inflammation and chemotherapy.
Iron 9 and ferritin 2553 suggests anemia of chronic inflammation, which is consistent with his overall clinical picture.
Fevers: no infectious source, likely due to MCD/Lymphoma.
Patient had nighttime fevers for two weeks prior to admission, despite treatment for PCP PNA, VZV/HSV hepatitis.
On the medicine floor, he underwent extensive infectious workup for opportunistic infection, endocarditis (negative TTE), viral infection (brief course of IVIG in the setting of suspicion for Parvo), fungal infection (briefly on Fluconazole, which was stopped in the setting of elevated T bili).
He remained afebrile for the rest of his admission.
# Respiratory failure: resolved, likely from volume overload.
Due to tachypnea and increased work of breathing, patient was intubated emergently upon arrival to the ICU on [**1-23**].
His pressor requirement escalated quickly, requiring Neosynephrine, Vasopressin, and Levophed for a short period.
This was initially concerning for sepsis in the setting of infectious workup (see above).
Patient was found to had small-moderate pleural effusions on CT chest and chest radiographs suggestive of possible volume overload.
He ambulated without dyspnea and had no supplemental oxygen requirement.
His leukocytosis was likely related to malignancy/acute illness.
# Acute oliguric renal failure: resolved.
He had a CVVHD requirement while in the ICU for less than 2 weeks.
The insult was likely secondary to a combination of contrast-induced nephropathy, ATN, and possibly an element of tumor lysis syndrome or Ig-related nephropathy as well (SPEP and UPEP were not consistent with this, however).
