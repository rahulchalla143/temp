Admission Date:  [**2129-2-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-3-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2051-9-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Location (un) 1279**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right-sided thoracentesis   History of Present Illness: Pt is a 77 y.o.
male with h/o rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical mvr/avr, afib (s/p VVI PPM); CAD s/p x 2 with stenting of RCA and LAD; h/o CHF with preserved EF 55%; 2+MR around [**Location (un) 31820**] leakage around mechanical valve, recently discharged for severe CHF requiring natrecor, lasix and dopamine drips, chronic anemia, MDS, and more recent d/c for fall and ARF admitted to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital on [**2-10**].
* Pt presented to [**Hospital1 882**] with hypoxia and change in mental status from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
At [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, pt with a 7 lb weight gain over week prior to admission, with attempted increase in Bumex to compensate for weight gain.
On day of admission, pt with increasing somnolence and O2 sat 80s on room air --> 92% on 2L.
Also, in the week prior to admission, pt's Remeron was doubled secondary to depression.
Additionally, pt's daughter said that pt had slurred speech week PTA and called her saying nonsensicle things, which is unusual for him (of note remeron doubled around that time).
* At [**Name (NI) 882**] Hospital pt found to be in hypercarbic respiratory failure with PCO2 71.
Repeat echo done to rule out [**Name (NI) 31820**] [**Name (NI) 3564**] showed EF 60% and functioning mechanical valves.
On CXR pt with loculated effusion that was tapped on [**2129-2-14**] c/w transudative process per D/C summary.
He was started to be treated to a CAP but this was stopped secondary to decreased suspicion with Abx d/cd [**2129-2-14**] (do not know which abx).
Additionally, pt's coumadin was held there as pt got thoracentesis and he was bridged on a heparin gtt.
Pt also found to be c. diff positive and started on flagyl [**2129-2-15**].
No SOB or CP.
Pt tells team that he has been compliant with low sodium diet and there have been no recent medication changes.
CAD - s/p cath [**2128-10-20**] with 3VD:  99% distal LAD, 60% LCx at origin of prior PTCA, RCA 50% distal with 70% RPL.
Last stress [**9-27**]--> moderate to severe, fixed perfusion defect of all three segments of the inferior and inferolateral walls extending into the apex (fixed compared to partially reversible in [**7-28**]).
CHF - EF >55% 2+MR [**Last Name (Titles) 31820**], RV dysfunction, moderate pulmonary HTN 4.
Chronic mechanical hemolysis 8.
of perirectal abscess s/p surgery 9.
Hemorrhoidal bleeding   Social History: No EtOH or tobacco.
Irregularly irregular rhythm.
Lungs: Decreased B/S b/l L>R.
Abd: SOft, mildly distended, LLQ with small few cm hard object (has been there always per pt).
Ext: [**12-26**]+ pitting edema b/l.
SCM and shoulder shrug strong.
CHF- On the floor, he failed to diurese to natrecor and lasix, with dopamine for BP support.
This was changed in the AM to vasopressin, lasix, and levophed, as given his low SVR and low-grade temp it was felt he had some septic physiology.
Since he was also clearly volume overloaded, he was given diuril to augment diuresis with Lasix, which was effective.
He had a large pleural effusion, which was tapped on [**2-19**] and was c/w transudate.
He was not placed on an ACE-I or beta-blocker given his relative hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the high 80s and 90s - which is his baseline blood pressure.
He was not placed on a beta-blocker given his low blood pressure.
Rhythm- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was monitored on telemetry with no issues.
Anemia- Secondary to mechanical hemolysis MDS and anemia of chronic disease.
Nosocomial pneumonia - The patient was presumed to have a nosocomial pneumonia and placed on Zosyn for a 7 day course.
He remained afebrile thereafter.
Pulmonary followed the patient and believed the patient would benefit from an outpatient sleep study and PFTs to assess for obstructive sleep apnea.
He was at first treated with diamox which had little effect on his serum bicarbonate and was thus, discontinued.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Diastolic congestive heart failure Atrial fibrillation h/o rheumatic heart disease with aortic and mitral valve replacement Resolved clostridium difficile diarrhea   Discharge Condition: Stable.
