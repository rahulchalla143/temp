HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  69-year-old male with past medical history of transient ischemic attacks, hyperlipidemia, lower gastrointestinal bleed from polypectomy (hyperplastic polyp plus adenoma) in [**2152**] negative for cancer admitted last week with history of anorexia and abdominal distention now returns with worsening abdominal pain and distention with dyspnea.
Workup during last admission found mesenteric peritoneal implants with evidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis on CT abdomen.
CT chest found diffuse necrotic mediastinal lymphadenopathy with two right lobe nodules (one spiculated right upper lobe nodule at 1.1 cm in its greatest dimension and one non-calcified nodule in the right lower lobe with right paratracheal precarinal and a subcarinal mass).
White blood count was elevated on discharge at 19.1, which was up from prior; however, no fevers or chills or lethargy.
At prior admission patient presented after working out at gym with the complaint of feeling lethargic more than usual for four days.
He then lost his appetite and noticed a three- pound weight gain over four days.
Also states a 20-pound weight gain over the past year that was intentional.
Bronchoscopy of the subcarinal lymph nodes (subcarinal mass) was postponed secondary to Plavix taken five days prior.
At [**Hospital1 18**], 3300 cc of ascites fluid was drained via paracentesis.
Afterwards an outpatient scheduled visit with GI performed in-house which revealed no suspicious lesions.
Patient's current complaint of abdominal pain and distention with shortness of breath began acutely the day after discharge and progressively worsened in severity.
His symptoms rapidly increased over Saturday and Sunday without notable exacerbating or alleviating factors.
Patient also mentions decreased urine output since last discharge despite continuous fluid intake.
Patient has a complaint of night sweats.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from Pathology only received 25 ml of the prior 2400 cc of ascites fluid drained last week.
Status post colonoscopy with polypectomy in [**2152**]; three sessile non-bleeding polyps (positive for adenoma) were removed, negative for cancer; diverticulosis noted throughout colon.
Status post ASD repair with trace AI and MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 113**] in [**2148**]; normal chamber size and function.
He has had no known exposure to asbestos in his lifetime.
No known exposure to TB.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, in no acute distress.
Dry mucous membranes.
Oropharynx:  Clear, no lymphadenopathy.
Jugular venous distention flat.
Cardiac exam:  S1 and S2 normal, regular rate and rhythm, I/VI holosystolic ejection murmur, no rubs or gallops.
Pulmonary exam:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no rales, no wheeze.
No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.
The elevated potassium was thought to be due to hemolysis .............  Chem-7 was done at 10 a.m.
UA was done; yellow, clear, specific gravity of 1.015, trace protein, negative for urinary tract infection.
Chest x-ray was done in the Emergency Department and demonstrated bilateral filler lymphadenopathy but otherwise unremarkable.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted for malignant ascites and hyperkalemia of 5.8.
Hyperkalemia was corrected via 10 units of insulin plus 50% of 50 cc of glucose solution with a resulting potassium of 4.6 at 2 a.m. the following morning.
EKG done in the ED and repeat EKG done on the floor demonstrated poor R-wave progression without prior for comparison.
Further analysis of the ascites drained on [**2154-8-26**] demonstrated gram stain with 2+ , no micro organisms.
Cultures were negative for growth, and cytokeratin stain was positive with negative staining with TIF/1.
On [**2154-8-27**] the patient's serum LDH was found to be elevated at 452.
His albumin was found to be decreased at 2.2  On [**2154-8-28**] a full dermatological exam was performed and found to be negative for melanoma.
A TSH was found to be elevated at 11.
Serum II ascites albumin gradient was found to be 0.1, indicating no portal hypertension.
Placement of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] type abdominal drain was then ordered via Interventional Radiology.
Patient then developed severe constipation and was treated with Dulcolax times one, Senna times one, Lactulose times two without effect.
As of [**2154-8-30**] pathology indicates a preliminary diagnosis of adenocarcinoma likely of lung or pancreatic source.
Interventional Radiology did place [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] style abdominal pain and peripherally inserted central catheter line without complication.
Hyperkalemia was noted to be corrected at 5.0.
Secondary to poor p.o.
Patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] Oncology Medicine Service on the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] for initiation of chemotherapy for the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma with unknown primary source.
Malignant metastatic ascites.
