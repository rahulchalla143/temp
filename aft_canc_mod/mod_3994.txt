Admission Date:  [**2170-12-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2170-12-11**]  Date of Birth:   [**2109-3-6**]     Sex:  M  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old gentleman with past medical history significant for COPD, bullous emphysema, pulmonary embolus, chronic thromboembolic disease, pulmonary hypertension, and atrial fibrillation who presented from [**Doctor Last Name **] House with a one day history of increased shortness of breath, bilateral lower extremity edema and facial swelling.
On presentation, denied chest pain and palpitations, fever, chills, cough.
In the Emergency Room was found to be 74% on room air, was placed on a non rebreather with increased sats to 94-95% and chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions, right greater than left with interstitial edema.
Initially was treated as a CHF exacerbation on a Nitro drip and Lasix; eventually required Bi-PAP because of continued trouble with breathing.
Because of the patient's bilateral lower extremity swelling, the patient had lower extremity dopplers which did demonstrate a left sided clot, DVT, in his common femoral vein extending to his popliteal vein.
The patient also had an emergent echo done in the Emergency Room which showed PA pressures of 97, severe right ventricular dysfunction and patient was then sent for a CT angiogram which showed extensive clot burden of the bilateral pulmonary arteries.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes history of pulmonary emboli, reportedly per patient first in [**2134**].
From records from [**Hospital1 2025**] noted to have pulmonary embolus a year ago and was evaluated at [**Hospital1 2025**] for pulmonary hypertension, chronic thromboembolic disease and was started on anticoagulation at that time.
The patient has history of COPD with bullous emphysema on two liters nasal cannula at home, history of hypertension, history of prostate cancer just followed by PSA's, no intervention yet.
History of hydrocele, history of atrial fibrillation, history of perforated ulcers requiring a Billroth II surgery, history of restrictive pulmonary function test and otherwise no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  No coronary artery disease, no peripheral vascular disease.
No history of clots.
Cardiovascular was prominent PMI, prominent right sided heave, positive gallop, no murmurs appreciated, no evidence of tachycardia, regular rate and rhythm.
Well healed vertical scars.
Extremities, 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities, warmer to pulsation, 2+ DP pulses, amputated 4th left toe.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was a 61-year-old gentleman with past medical history of chronic thromboembolic disease, history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with bullous emphysema, history of prostate cancer, atrial fibrillation, who presents with acute on chronic pulmonary embolism while on therapeutic Coumadin.
Pulmonary embolus:  The patient had a pulmonary embolus while on therapeutic Coumadin and was considered a Coumadin failure.
However, the patient had CT angiogram with large clot burden bilaterally, no evidence of extension of clot into the right atrium on echocardiogram.
However, two days following admission the patient had an acute episode of hypotension, hypoxia and tachycardia and as was considered less hemodynamically stable, the patient received treatment with TPA, no evidence of bleed or neurologic change after this, however, patient's oxygenation remained stable in the 80's to 90's as had been prior to episode of acute decompensation.
As patient continued to require increased oxygen requirements on non rebreather and eventually to C-PAP.
During the course of his stay, the patient had repeated echocardiograms including echocardiogram with a bubble study which did show improvement in his PR gradient from 97 on admission to 84 as was noted from his previous discharge summaries from [**Hospital1 2025**], was noted to have elevated PA pressures on echocardiogram a year prior to this and had chronic history of pulmonary hypertension.
The patient otherwise had good LV function but did have a bubble study which showed stretched patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect which was likely a shunt secondary to patient's chronic right heart failure as a compensation.
Echo study also showed severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis which was also consistent with previous echocardiogram reports from his [**Hospital1 2025**] hospitalization including a right heart catheterization during that hospitalization.
His echocardiogram did show presence of pericardial effusion which was determined to be stable in size and asymptomatic and which was continued to be followed.
The patient remained asymptomatic and was probably chronically hypoxic.
Eventually patient had family meeting including his nieces and his PCP and the primary team and as concerns for chronicity of patient's condition and limited options in terms of treatments secondary to his large clot burden and large pulmonary artery pressures, the patient's code status was changed to DNR, DNI.
The patient was continued to be treated with C-PAP machine as tolerated, however, eventually patient was refusing this secondary to discomfort and was maintained on a non rebreather mask as tolerated.
Eventually as patient continued to remain hypoxic, patient was started on prn doses of Ativan and Morphine for increased agitation and discomfort and eventually patient's nieces were called back and decision was made to move toward comfort measures on a Morphine drip.
Eventually patient was transitioned from a non rebreather mask to nasal cannula which was more comfortable and eventually at 5:55 p.m. the patient's saturations decreased and patient was pronounced dead secondary to respiratory failure, secondary to chronic pulmonary hypertension, secondary to chronic thromboembolic disease complicated by acute on chronic pulmonary emboli.
Pulmonary embolus.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bullous emphysema.
Severe right heart failure.
Atrial fibrillation.
