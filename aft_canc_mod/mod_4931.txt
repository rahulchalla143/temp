An EKG showed no specific ST changes, but his enzymes were elevated.
He underwent a heart catheterization which revealed multi-vessel coronary artery disease as well as moderate aortic stenosis.
He underwent workup previously and was admitted now for elective surgery.
Past Medical History: coronary artery disease aortic stenosis noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus hypertension benign prostatic hypertrophy h/ prostate cancer s/p colon resection s/p coronary interventions/stents  Social History: former smoker  2-4 packs per day for 10 years, but quit 40 years ago.

There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
Significant aortic stenosis is present but consistent and adequate gradients could not be obtained, nor could plainemetry be adequately performed due to degree of stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**1-1**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a mechnaical Aortic Valve (#23 Onyx per surgeons) insitu with no perivalvular leak or AI.
There is a peak gradient of 17 mm Hg, mean 7 mm Hg across the valve.
Mitral regurgitation is now moderate.
Aortic contours appear without luminal irregularties.
All narcotics were stopped and he was started on Ultram for pain with resolution on his confusion.
Ultram was subsequently stopped and Tylenol was used for pain control.
Scars and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation were consistent with prior Zoster inflammation.
He was afebrile and white blood count was within normal limits at the time of discharge.
He was noted to have a large left pleural effusion on CXR and on POD 9 he underwent a thoracentesis after allowing INR to drift down which drained 2800 cc of fluid.
Repeat CXR showed left basilar atelectasis but better aeration of the side.
