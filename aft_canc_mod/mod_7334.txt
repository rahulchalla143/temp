He was most recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] from [**2154-7-12**] to [**2154-7-16**] when he presented with fevers, bilateral infiltrates and hypoxemia.
At that time it was thought that he most like had a pneumonia related to his MDS but he was also thought to have an element of congestive heart failure and his hypoxemia resolved quickly with diuresis.
His wife reports that approximately ten days ago she developed a viral URI with cough and congestsion and that her husband caught this virus as well.
Their acute symptoms resolved but the patient continued to have cough.
Starting a week prior to this admission he reports starting to feel more lethargic although even as late as one day prior to admission he was able to walk [**4-18**] of a mile without getting short of breath (although he was fatigued).
At 10 AM he began to feel nauseus and vomited x 1.
At 11 AM he began to feel somewhat short of breath and his wife noticed that he felt warm.
He also noted that his cough was more productive than previously of clear sputum.
CXR and CTA show RLL PNA and mild pulmonary edema.
On arrival to the MICU the patient was found to be breathing comfortably on NRB without respiratory distress or accessory muscle use.
On review of sytems he now denies headache, neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, says his SOB is much improved, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria, melena, hematochezia, hematemasis, easy bruising, calf pain or swelling.
He has had worsening lower extremity edema over the past month but this is actually improved at this time.

Physical Exam: Admission Physical Exam: PE: T: 98.1 BP: 120/70 HR: 66 RR: 18 O2 94% 6L NC Gen: Pleasant, comfortable, speaking in full sentences HEENT: No conjunctival pallor.
crackles [**1-16**] way up bilaterally, no wheezes or ronchi ABD: NABS.
Soft, NT, ND EXT: WWP, Trace LE edema.
Imaging CXR PA and Lateral [**2154-8-30**]: MPRESSION: Improving congestive heart failure and right basilar pneumonia.
Portable CXR [**2155-8-25**]: Consolidation in the right lower lobe has progressed since [**8-23**] consistent with worsening pneumonia.
Mild pulmonary edema and mild cardiomegaly stable.
No appreciable pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
New airspace process in the left lower lobe, posteriorly; in this clinical setting, early pneumonic consolidation is a consideration.
Significant improvement in findings of CHF since the [**2-20**] study, with residual interstitial edema and no significant effusion.
CTA [**2154-8-23**]: 1. right lower lobe pneumonia 2. mild pulmonary edema 3. pathologic mediastinal adenopathy, unchanged .
Nonspecific ST-TW changes.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 75M w/hx of pancreatic CA s/p resection and splenectomy, MDS, CHF, and htn presents with fever, productive cough and SOB.
CT/CXR showed evidence of RLL consolidation.
In this clinical setting, most likely diagnosis is a community-acquired pneumonia.
# Community-acquired pneumonia: The patient presented with fevers, cough and shortness of breath.
He was found to have a RLL pneumonia seen in CXR and Chest CT scan.
The patient has chronically elevated WBC secondary to MDS with acute rise on this admission to 56k which is consistent with acute infection although it is difficult to assess given his chronic MDS.
On exam the patient was noted to have significant crackles in his lung fields bilaterally, an elevate JVP and mild lower extremity edema and it was thought that congestive heart failure was likely contributing to his oxygen requirement.
He was originally admitted to the MICU for management of his hypoxia but at no time did he require mechanical ventillation.
The patient's symptoms of cough and SOB gradually resolved over hospital course with O2 sat of 93% on 5L improving to 95 %RA at rest and with ambulation.
# Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure with preserved biventricular function from last echo in [**Month (only) 956**].
He also has a history of elevated BNPs from 8000-[**Numeric Identifier 16351**].
He has only trace edema on CT and CXR but during his last hospitalization he presented very similarly and responded well to diuresis.
Exam notable throughout hospitalization for b/l inspiratory crackles, midly elevated JVP and trace pedal edema.
Over course, patient's symptom of SOB improved as did his respiratory exam.
Repeat CXR on [**8-30**] showed decreased pulmonary edema.
# Fever: On admission the patient was noted to be febrile to 102 degrees.
Urine culture grew ~1000 gram positive organisms but repeat culture later in this hospitalization was negative.
Patient did have a significant leukocytosis but this is consistent with his past values in the setting of his myelodysplastic syndrome.
Upon discharge he had been afebrile for greater than 72 hours.
# Hypertension:  Patient was noted to have elevated blood pressures to the 150s to 180s on the floor.
# Myelodysplastic Syndrome: The patient was diagnosed 15 yrs ago.
The patient has a chronically elevated WBC.
Per his outpatient PCP the patient has no evidence of AML conversion at this time.
He was continued on his home dose of hydroxyurea during this hospitalization and will follow up with his primary care physician.
# Anemia: The patient has a chronically low hematocrit which ranges from 26-30.
# pancreatic cancer: The patient is s/p subtotal pancreatectomy, Xeloda, XRT, and Cyberknife.
# Type II diabetes: As an outpatient the patient reports that he takes levemir 9 units QHS with glipizide 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] and metformin 500 mg [**Hospital1 **].
On a regimen of lantus 9 units QHS and glipizide 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] the patient was noted to have significant AM hypoglycemia with AM blood sugars on chemistries in the 30s and 40s.
# Subclinical Hypothyroidism:  During this admission the patinet was noted to have an elevated TSH at 6.6 and a normal T4 at 1.1.
He should have repeat TFTs as an outpatient once he has recovered from his acute illness.
