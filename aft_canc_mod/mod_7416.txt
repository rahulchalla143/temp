Denies melena or history of hemorrhoids.
He underwent Abd/Pelvic CT to r/o retroperitoneal hematoma compressing plexus, causing leg sx.
He also had an MRI with DWI (stroke protocol) brain to look for new area of infarct and MRA to look for likely ACA territory abnl (ie, occlusion).
DWI images were significant for new embolic CVA in leg motor strip area.
Pt w/ increased tone diffusely in the LE.
A/P: 79 yo M with recent admission to Neurology for LUE weakness thought to be related to embolic CVA who presents with acute onset of LLE weakness found to have new CVA, likely embolic despite anticoagulation, also with GIB [**1-5**] elevated INR while on coumadin found to have rectal mass on colonoscopy [**10-26**].
# Rectal Mass.
He remained on telemetry from the operation to the time of discharge because of occasional PVCs.
No drainage from rectal area.
Mild depression was discussed with pt, who refused psychiatry consult.
On POD4 ([**11-8**]), patient passed 20-30cc of what appeared to be a peri-operative blood clot and dark blood per rectum.
No active bleeding was noted.
VS were stable and serial HCT suggested no acute loss of blood.
Later in the evening, patient had a 12-beat run of PVCs, without any symptom, EKG change or electrolyte abnormality.
No further bleeding likley [**1-5**] to above.
Patient has been passing some small clots per rectum with mucous.
# CVA: Patient's symptoms and MRI/MRA suggest new stroke, likely in watershed distribution, embolic source despite anticoagulation.

Neuro eval recommends no further w/up, but possibilities inclue CTA of aorta, imaging of carotids to eval for source.
