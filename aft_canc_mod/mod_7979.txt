The patient did well but on the night of [**2200-3-15**] noted acute sudden onset of pain in his right first metatarsal pharyngeal joint felt to be most consistent with gout.
Given the fact that the patient could not be started on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or systemic steroids and that Colchicine with its gastrointestinal toxicity should also be avoided at this time the Rheumatology service injected the metatarsal phalangeal joint with 40 mg of Depo Medrol with good effect.
