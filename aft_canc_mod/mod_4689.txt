Admission Date:  [**2135-3-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2135-3-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2077-12-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**] Chief Complaint: GI bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: This is a 57 year-old male with a history of metastatic esophageal cancer who presents with anemia.
He underwent ERCP with stent placement for a lower CBD extrinsic compression with dilated upper CBD and intrahepatic ducts.
After the procedure he was briefly hypotensive and was d/ced on Levo and flagyl for 8 days.
He also had a LUL cavitary lesion felt to be a necrotic met vs. abcess for which the abx were also intended.
He also has fallen without a head strike.
He cut his elbow a few days ago and has also been intermittently bleeding from the site large quantities.
he described the blood loss via mouth as 1 oz.
He has chronic abd discomfort which is not signficantly worse.
He has constipation but was incontinent of loose brown stool last evening.
There he was hypotensive to 70s but not tachycardic.
The patient denies any fevers, chills, diarrhea,  chest pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, cough, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.
Past Medical History: h/o ETOH abuse and polysubstance abuse history of PE (noted incidentally on a CT) Metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, diagnosed [**10-7**], metastatic to liver and lung   Social History: h/o ETOH abuse and polysubstance abuse (opiates / heroin) denies IVDU, 60pk yr history of smoking   Family History: - Brother with GERD - Denies any FH of cancer or heart disease - Extensive family history of EtOH abuse  Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 96.2 BP: 82/51,  HR: 74 RR: 22 O2Sat: 100%2L GEN:cachetic, jaundice, chronically ill appearing in NAD HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera icteric, dried blood at nares, Dry MM, OP thrush NECK: No JVD, trachea midline COR: RRR, no M/G/R, normal S1 S2, radial pulses +2 PULM: Lungs CTAB, no W/R/R ABD: + fluid wave, diffuse submucosal nodularity.
Soft, mild diffuse tenderness, ND, +BS, no HSM, no masses EXT: 4+ BL LE edema, no palpable cords NEURO: alert, oriented to person, place, and time.
IMAGING: CT chest/abd/pelvis w/o contrast (wet read): chest: 1. small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
right has slightly increased in size since [**2135-2-23**].
2. again, multifocal consolidation and developing abscesses with enlarging left upper lobe pneumatocele.
no new areas.
significant amount of fluid/debris within stent; measures low density and unlikely acute hemorrhage.
punctate foci of high density material at the GE junction and fundus of stomach are likely broken off pieces of the stent stuck within the wall of the stomach.
2. diffuse hepatic metastases appear to have worsened since the recent chest CT. 3. metallic CBD stent appears unchanged in position and appearance.
4. large amount of ascites measuring simple fluid density.
5. no evidence of hematoma or areas of high density fluid to suggest bleeding on this noncontrast study.
6. high density material within the bowel could reflect acute bleeding within the colon and distal small bowel.
7. tiny nonobstructing right renal stones.
CXR: IMPRESSION: Interval decrease in size and extent of right middle and lower lobe nodules, and decreased surrounding opacity about a left upper lobe probable pneumatocele.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 57 year-old male with a history of metastatic esophogeal adenocarcinoma who presents with severe anemia, GI bleed, and increased lethargy.
# Adenocarcinoma of esophagus with metastases of liver and lungs with multi-organ failure:  While he was still pursing pallative chemo with his oncologist at [**Hospital3 3765**], it became clear during this hospitalization that he was too sick undergo any further chemotherapy.
Due to his end-stage and deteriorating condition, the family decided, in accordance with the patient wishes, to withdraw all care (including antibiotics, blood transfusion, and laboratory data/vital signs monitoring) and transition him to CMO.
His pain was controlled with ativan, fentanyl gtt, and a morphine gtt.
With his family by his side, he became progressively bradycardic and passed away quickly thereafter in the early evening on [**2135-3-5**].
The following issues were addressed during his brief hospitalization:  # Acute anemia:  Possible etiologies of blood loss included GI bleeding from the tumor at the esophageal stent or hemobilia with recent stent placement are both highly possible, especially in the setting of his coagulopathy and recent lovenox administration.
The initial description of bleed seemed more consistent with epistaxis and ENT was consulted for an exam but did not find any suspicious source of bleeding.
GI and ERCP were consulted and wanted to hold off on evaluating the biliary stent and possible biliary tree investigation due to continued coagulopathy and risk of bleeding.
He was given vitamin K and FFP for elevated INR and DIC labs were checked.
His labs did show evidence of hemolysis with elevated bilirubin, low haptoglobin and elevated LDH.
He was started on an octreotide and protonix gtt's for GI bleeding prophylaxis.
Likely combination of hypotension and loss of liver function.
With elevated WBC and biliary obstruction, cholangitis was considered a likely cause, despite the lack of RUQ pain and fevers.
There was also increased concern about his previous lung abscess which could be causing severe infection.
He was continued on broad coverage with vanco, cefepime and flagyl for suspected cholangitis and respiratory coverage.
# Hypotension: SBP in 70s, but given liver pathology and lack of tachycardic compensation, this is likely not far from baseline.
Likely further exacerbated with acute blood loss.
Since he was not responsive to IVF boluses and 5% albumin, he was started on Levophed due to persistent hypotension.
Likely prerenal given blood loss and poor oncotic pressure with albumin < 2.0.
He was volume resuscitated, but his kidney function continued to worsen, likely secondary to intrinsic renal dysfunction from ATN and sustained hypotension.
2. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO at bedtime as needed for anxiety or nausea: do not take if driving or drinking  alcohol.
