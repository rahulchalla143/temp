She was admitted to an outside hospital on [**2166-11-19**], with increased shortness of breath.
The patient required intubation for hypoxemia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   The patient's history is notable for lung cancer diagnosed in [**2155**], status post radiation therapy.
She has a history of pleural effusions.
Also status post pleural biopsy done in [**2166-10-9**], which was positive for adenocarcinoma.
She also has chronic pericardial effusions, thought to be secondary to radiation therapy.
SOCIAL HISTORY:   Significant for continued smoking.
Her chest examination revealed scattered rhonchi.
Her heart examination was regular, with normal S1 and a physiologically split S2, no S3 or S4, and a soft systolic murmur at the upper left sternal border.
Her abdomen was soft, with bowel sounds present but hypoactive.
Chest x-ray showed normal heart size, bilateral pleural effusions, right perihilar mass, patchy infiltrates.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 108 beats per minute, with left axis deviation, low limb voltages, and no ischemic changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The overall impression is of a 54-year-old woman with Stage IV lung cancer and a post-obstructive pneumonia.
Lung cancer:  The patient has Stage IV lung cancer with pleural metastases diagnosed by biopsy on [**2166-11-7**], which revealed adenocarcinoma.
On [**11-24**], she underwent bronchoscopy which revealed near-total tumor obstruction of the right upper lobe and right middle lobe, and on CT was found to have partial collapse of the right middle lobe and right upper lobe.
Pneumonia:  The patient was felt to have a post-obstructive pneumonia.
Pericardial effusions:  The patient had an echocardiogram performed on [**11-25**], which revealed small pericardial effusion but no tamponade physiology.
The etiology of her hypotension was unclear.
The patient was given intravascular volume and her pneumonia was treated, however, she remained hypotensive, requiring dopamine on discharge.
Change in mental status:  The patient was confused and agitated for much of her admission.
A CT scan of the brain was performed to rule out brain metastases, and this scan was negative.
Post-obstructive pneumonia 3.
