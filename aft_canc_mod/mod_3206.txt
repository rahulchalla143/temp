Admission Date:  [**2190-5-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2190-5-24**]  Date of Birth:   [**2118-10-1**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Medical Oncology  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of non-small cell lung cancer complicated by brain metastases that were resected on [**2190-3-16**].
He was presented to our mergency department with shortness of breath.
He was in his usual state of health until 2-3 days prior to admission when he began experiencing shortness of breath and fatigue.
Upon arrival at the [**Hospital1 69**], the patient was found to be markedly hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 92% on 100% nonrebreather face mask.
Of note, the patient reportedly had a CT angiogram done at the outside hospital that demonstrated a persistent left upper lobe mass, small bilateral pleural effusions, and small segmental pulmonary emboli on the right.
Although, the initial of anticoagulation was considered due to this finding, it was held initially because the patient reported bright red blood per rectum for several days prior to admission, and also because of his history of brain metastases.
Non-small cell lung cancer complicated by left frontal brain metastases status post resection on [**2190-3-16**].
Severe emphysema with a diffusion capacity of 52% of predicted on pulmonary function tests done on [**2190-4-15**].
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
The patient's father died at age 53 and may have had a history of pulmonary disease of unclear etiology.
The patient's brother died of an ischemic stroke.
Patient was found to be a pleasant man in mild respiratory distress.
His sclerae were anicteric and he had no jugular venous distention.
He had diffuse rhonchi on pulmonary auscultation with expiratory wheezes.
He had no peripheral edema, no calf tenderness, and warm extremities throughout.
He was reportedly trace guaiac positive on rectal examination.
Chest X-ray done on the day of admission demonstrated no evidence of congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
Also seen was interval increase in the size of a previously evident left lung nodule with development of a probable satellite lesion; these findings were highly suggestive of malignancy.
There was also a small left sided pleural effusion.
He then had a head CT scan that demonstrated no evidence for a new appreciable intracranial hemorrhage.
Bilateral lower extremity non-invasive studies also done on the day of admission demonstrated no evidence of DVT.
His urinalysis demonstrated a specific gravity of 1.007, small blood, trace protein, trace ketones, and was otherwise negative for any infectious process.
His electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus tachycardia at 100 beats per minute, rightward axis, and incomplete right bundle branch block, and had no significant change compared with an electrocardiogram dated [**2190-3-15**].
Shortness of breath and hypoxemia:  The patient's dyspnea and hypoxemia were initially attributed to a pulmonary embolus as noted above.
However, after consultation with multiple pulmonologists and radiologists, it was concluded that there was no definitive evidence of a pulmonary embolus on the admission CT scan.
Also as noted above, there was no evidence of either pneumonia or congestive heart failure on the admission imaging studies.
However, the patient remained persistently hypoxemic and dyspneic on the first several days of hospitalization.
An empiric trial of diuresis was therefore attempted; while the patient had increased urine output with this attempt, his dyspnea and hypoxemia did not improve.
He was also covered with broad-spectrum antibiotics including levofloxacin and metronidazole on admission for empiric coverage of a possible infectious process given his admission with fever and hypotension.
At no point during his hospitalization, however, did the patient have any evidence of a clear infectious process.
In the absence of any definitive explanation of the patient's dyspnea and hypoxemia, the etiology of his admission dyspnea and hypoxemia was attributed to a congestive obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation superimposed on the patient's poor underlying pulmonary function.
These steroids were rapidly tapered down his admission dose of dexamethasone; he was subsequently restarted on stress-dosed steroids when he later developed an episode of adrenal insufficiency as noted below.
The patient was discharged with plans for a very gradual steroid taper, as well as continued use of oxygen initially at rehabilitation and subsequently at home.
Hypotension:  As noted above, the patient was hypotensive on admission to the hospital.
He did subsequently develop a second episode of hypotension as noted above; however, this episode was attributed to adrenal insufficiency, and his hypotension resolved with administration of stress dosed steroids.
He remained afebrile and normotensive throughout the remainder of his hospitalization.
The consensus opinion as that, given the patient's significant underlying emphysema and his generally poor overall functional capacity, that the patient was not an ideal candidate for surgical resection of his lung mass.
Right upper quadrant deep venous thrombosis:  On [**2190-5-14**], prior to the patient's first transfer out of the Intensive Care Unit, he was noted to have a right upper extremity deep venous thrombosis around a central venous catheter that had been inserted in the Intensive Care Unit.
Infectious Diseases:  As noted above, at no point during hospitalization, was there any radiographic or microbiological evidence to support an infectious process.
The patient did receive a total of 11 days of antibiotics for empiric coverage and fever and hypotension given his intermittently for clear appearance.
His antibiotics were discontinued on [**5-21**], and he remained afebrile without any clinically apparent source of infection throughout the remainder of his hospitalization.
Congestive obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
Right upper extremity deep venous thrombosis.
