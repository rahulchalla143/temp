His other past medical history is signficant for a h/o West [**Doctor First Name **] infection c/b VRE, ?MRSA infections at [**Hospital1 112**] last year.
[**Name (NI) 72787**] from OSH negative for bleed or obvious mass.

GRAM POSITIVE COCCI.
Anaerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Preliminary):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCI.
Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Preliminary):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCI.
Anaerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Preliminary):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCI.
Abnormally dilated loops of small bowel, some demonstrating wall thickening.
Findings could represent proximal obstruction.
Left lower lobe consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
Multiple pulmonary nodules and small cystic lesions seen within the lungs, concerning for metastatic disease.
Short interval followup within three months is recommended given patient's history of malignancy.
Nodular peritoneal implants with diffuse mesenteric stranding concerning for metastatic disease.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Small area of low attenuation in the right frontal lobe, without significant mass effect or loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation.
?atypical or viral source.
Mental status on admission showed intact brain stem reflexes w/ reactive pupils, corneal blink, and no acute change in underlying mental status was observed during his ICU stay.
On admission to ICU, patient was initially covered with vancomycin and zosyn, but given concern for CNS infection was broadened to vancomycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, ampicillin and flagyl at appropriate doses.
EEG was performed and demonstrated no focal seizure activity with moderate global encephalopathy c/w toxic/metabolic process.
- EEG as above - TSH: Pending - Neurology consulted and agrees with above plan.
- Check peripheral smear for evaluation of TTP.
Airway protection given MS. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 78607**] well, unable to extubate given altered mental status.
CT scan of the chest demonstates left lower lobe consolidation.
Blood cultures from admission growing 4/4 bottles of gram positive cocci in pairs/chains - likely strep pneumo.
Extubation pending recovery of mental status.
- mild sedation - wean qAM - sputum cultures .
# Tachycardia.
ECG sinus tachy.
h/o DVT, no PE on CTA.
- mild sedation - monitor on tele .
# Seizure Activity.
No h/o seizure.
- Lesion on CT unlikely seizure focus as per neurology - MRA/MRV/EEG - consider LP for infection, toxic-metabolic w/up .
# Bandemia.
Likely related to infection, ?
# Stranding on Abd CT: appears c/w peritoneal mets from esophageal Ca.
?Gut ischemia vs. infection.
Belly soft on exam, evidence of dilated loops of small bowel with surrounding fluid/stranding.
# Hyponatremia: Worsened with 2L NS on admission suggesting SIADH.
Possibly some component of contrast nephropathy and but Cr elevated on admit.
Would monitor as given ARF and contrast load is high risk for contrast nephropathy.
# Esophageal CA.
# PPx.
