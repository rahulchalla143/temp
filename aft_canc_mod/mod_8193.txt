NO rhythm strip.
Had agonal breaths.
ems SAID "BIZZARE WIDE COMPLEX" and tachycardic.
Continued to have wide complex tachy.
A CXR showed RUL consolidation which was interpreted as possible pulmonary contusion.
There was a concern for aspiration and started on Levo and flagyl.
Incidentally he was found to have a pulmonary nodule and a CT was reccomended.

# Pulmonary Nodule with perihilar lymphadenopathy: The patient was found, incidentally to have a pulmonary nodule with perihilar lymphadenopathy.
Given his long smoking history there was a concern for malignancy.
After review of other masses in abdomen, the lung nodule was deemed the best place for initial biopsy.
U/S and MRI was performed to assess Liver and pancreatic lesions and it was felt, with conjunction of IP and IR that biopsing the lung would be the best route.
Results are pending at time of discharge  # Liver, and pancreatic lesions: An ultrasound was showed at least 5 lesions in the liver suggestive of hemangiomas.
An abdominal MRI revealed multiple liver masses believed to be benign cysts and others that are hemangiomas.
One liver mass was believed to be potentially malignant.
The pancreatic tail lesion was believed to be potentially malignant.
# Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has non-ischemic idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with EF 15%; it is still unknown as to primary etiology.
# Post-Obstructive Pneumonia: on Day 10 of piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin.
Warfarin had been held since early in the admission, first due to elevated INR and then for upcoming procedures.
No obvious cause of a normocytic anemia was found and the patient's stool was guaiac negative.
# Atrial fibrillation requiring anticoagulation: We have contact[**Name (NI) **] the patient's cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 77893**], regarding the need for close INR follow-up.
# Anti-arrhythmic therapy: The patient will take Amiodarone 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 1 month followed by 200 mg daily indefinitely.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: -Chronic Cardiac systolic dysfunction after either pulseless electrical activity orventricular tachycardia with arrest -Lung, liver, and pancreatic masses  Secondary diagnoses: -AFib -HTN  Discharge Condition: Fair.
[**Known lastname 3952**],  You were admitted to the hospital because of cardiac arrest and found to have lung, liver, and pancreatic masses.
The masses were better characterized on MRI and it was felt that biopsy of the lung was the best method for tissue diagnosis.
