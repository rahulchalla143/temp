lung abscess  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Flexible bronchoscopy, right thoracotomy, decortication, open lung biopsy, intercostal muscle flap, pericardial window and biopsy, mediastinal lymph node sampling.

ADDENDUM: Proximal to the fluid-filled cavity of the right middle lobe the middle lobe bronchus approximately 1 cm from its origin, with intrinsic and some extrinsic component.
The collection splays the right upper lobe anterior segment subsegmental bronchi at its superior margin (not the medial and lateral segmental bronchi of the right middle lobe as stated in the body of the report).
INDICATION: History of lung abscess.
COMPARISON: There are no prior CT exams or radiographs for comparison.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images through the chest were obtained following the administration of 80 cc of Optiray contrast IV.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: A 6.7 x 5.8 cm fluid-filled cavity in the right middle lobe containing small, non-dependent air bubbles, has a wall less than one cm thick, smooth internally, and moderately irregular externally.
There is a small right hydropneumothorax, despite a pleural catheter in place, and at least one small loculation in the medial mid right chest at the level of the carina.
A small rounded area of atelectasis or consolidation in the posterior right lower lobe (2A:50) is 20 mm wide.
There is a small simple left effusion, with associated atelectasis.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderate cardiomegaly involves all [**Doctor Last Name 1754**].
Multiple borderline paratracheal nodes measuring up to 10 mm are seen.
There is a 4.3 x 4.2 cm rounded lesion of the posterior right upper back subcutaneous tissue is not fully characterized but may be a sebaceous cyst.
There is asymmetric enlargement of the left breast tissue, of undetermined significance.
The exam was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis.
A calcified granuloma is in the right lobe of the liver posteriorly.
There are no bone findings concerning for malignancy.
There are degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.
Right middle lobe lung abscess, less likely cavitating neoplasm.
Mediastinal and celiac axis lymphadenopathy.
3cm right thyroid nodule.
Further evaluation with thyroid ultrasound recommended.
4.3-cm subcutaneous lesion, right upper back, possible cyst, but best evaluated clinically.
Cardiomegaly, mitral annulus and coronary artery calcifications, enlarged ascending aorta, aortic valve replacement, and probably pulmonary hypertension.
The right middle lobe abscess or neoplasm was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 41455**] on the afternoon of [**2104-1-4**].
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 77 year old man with right pleural fluid collection REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: place pigtail catheter in right pleural abcess.
INDICATION: Right hemithoracic fluid collection requiring drainage.
PROCEDURE: After explaining potential risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure to the [**Hospital 228**] healthcare proxy, verbal consent was obtained.
Limited images of the chest were obtained with the patient in the left posterior oblique position for localization purposes only.
Images confirm the presence of a heterogeneous collection with a thick rind in the right middle lobe along the major fissure, with at least one air locule.
A small loculated right hydropneumothorax is again noted, perhaps slightly increased in size, with a posterior pigtail catheter in stable position.
Pacemaker leads, sternotomy wires, extensive coronary artery and mitral annular calcifications are seen in addition to an aortic valve prosthesis.
Left lower lobe atelectasis appears mild.
The right lower axilla was marked, prepared and draped in the usual sterile fashion and 1% lidocaine was used for local anesthesia.
Using CT guidance and trocar technique, a 10 French catheter was inserted directly into the collection and approximately 35 cc of purulent hemorrhagic fluid was aspirated, a portion of which was sent to microbiology.
Adequate hemostasis was achieved and there were no immediate complications.
Limited post-procedure images revealed slight interval decrease in the collection size.
Patient status post CT-guided 10 French catheter placement into a right middle lobe fluid collection without immediate complication.
He underwent CT guided drainage of lung abscess.
However, he failed to resolve infection and continued to have significant leukocytosis and fevers.
At the time of the procedure, frozen section pathology of the lung and pericardium revealed stage IV squamous disease.
On POD4 he developed worsening shortness of breathing and had an episode of desaturation.
Given the patient's poor prognosis and his wished to have no further intervention.
