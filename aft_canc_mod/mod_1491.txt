Admission Date:  [**2179-1-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2179-1-7**]  Date of Birth:   [**2103-9-24**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Perforated diverticulitis in the context of recently diagnosed lung cancer.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75 year old gentleman with a 50 pack year history of tobacco use who had presented to his primary care physician in [**2178-11-19**], complaining of approximately three months of indigestion along with gas and belching.
At the time, the patient also complained of anorexia and early satiety with a twenty pound weight loss.
The patient also complained of occasional hemoptysis.
On workup, the patient was found to have a left lung cancer.
The patient underwent CT scan of his abdomen to evaluate persistent pyuria and hematuria on [**2178-12-28**], during which he was noted to have a 3.8 centimeter diverticular abscess adjacent to the posterior wall of the bladder.
No fistulous connection between the abscess and the bladder was identified.
A general surgery consultation was requested and the decision ultimately made to discharge the patient home with a readmission on [**2179-1-4**], for colonoscopy followed by a sigmoid resection on [**2179-1-6**].
The patient was to see his cardiologist prior to his admission for cardiac clearance.
Coronary artery disease, status post cardiac catheterization on [**2179-1-1**], and status post myocardial infarction.
Congestive heart failure.
Left lower lung mass and right apical nodule.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient was in no apparent distress and alert and oriented times three.
The lungs were clear but with decreased air movement in the left lower lobe.
The patient was noted to have a diffuse rash over his trunk and groin which the patient had not noticed before.
The patient underwent his colonoscopy on [**2179-1-5**], as planned during which he was noted to have diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon and descending colon and three polyps at the ascending colon and the proximal descending colon.
The patient had seen his cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], on [**2179-1-1**], and was noted to have severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe multivessel coronary artery disease.
No intervention was performed.
On the morning of [**2179-1-6**], the patient complained of some indigestion as well as some shortness of breath just before being called down to the operating room.
An electrocardiogram obtained at the bedside revealed 2.0 millimeter ST segment elevations in leads V2 through V4.
A chest x-ray was also obtained which revealed collapse of the patient's left lower lobe with some midline shift.
It was believed that the patient's left lower lobe collapse was contributing to some myocardial ischemia by limiting the patient's oxygenation.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and were ultimately negative for myocardial infarction.
The patient underwent bronchoscopy on the afternoon of [**2179-1-6**], during which some thick mucous plugs were suctioned out of his left and right lower lobes.
The previously identified left lower lobe tumor was identified.
By this time, the patient appeared to be at his baseline in terms of his respiratory effort and was complaining of no further sensation of indigestion.
The patient is also to follow-up with his primary care physician within one to two weeks following discharge for further management of his lung cancer and cardiac status.
Left lower lobe lung cancer.
Coronary artery disease.
