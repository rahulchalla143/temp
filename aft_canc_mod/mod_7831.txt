On sunday and monday she became increasingly short of breath and fatigued and began having chills with her fever.
Patient has metastatic renal cell carcinoma and is currently receiving therapy on a clinical trial with a novel antibody against PD-L1.
The study drug has been associated with autoimmune sideeffects including pneumonitis, but clinical picture in the ED was more concerning for an infectious process.
On [**8-15**], Pt was ready to be discharged but then developed acute hypoxia (transisent to 80s) and tachycardia to 150.
At 6:30am [**8-16**], she had HR to 120's, SBP 90's, was asymptomatic, given 500 cc NS bolus with pressure responsive to the 100s but developed crackles bilaterally.
Her Metoprolol 12.5mg TID was changed back to [**Hospital1 **] for low BP 88/50s later that afternoon.
On [**8-17**], she completed her course of Levofloxacin (repeat CXR showed no clear evidence of PNA) and was called-out to the floor.
On transfer, she states that she feels relatively well and that her breathing is stable.
Past Medical History: Metastatic renal cell carcinoma Hypertension Dyslipidemia CAD s/p PCI Osteopenia Internal hemorrhoids - last colonoscopy [**2176-10-4**] for +FOBT with benign polyps only Last normal mammogram [**2176-8-22**] s/p BL knee replacement [**12/2175**] and [**1-/2176**]   Social History: She has two sons, one in [**Name (NI) 86**] and the other in [**Male First Name (un) 1056**].
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 36211**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 91489**] is her neice who is an OB/Gyn and lives in CT; she is very involved with Ms. [**Known lastname 91490**] care with Ms. [**Known lastname 91490**] consent.
Mother and Father died in their 80s; mother had alzheimer's and died of MI, father died of unknown causes   Physical Exam: General: Dark skin, alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi Abdomen: soft, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly, no tenderness to palpation, no rebound or guarding  GU: no foley Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: CNII-XII intact, 5/5 strength upper/lower extremities, grossly normal sensation, 2+ reflexes bilaterally, gait deferred.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2177-7-31**] there is no significant change.
[**8-12**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Significant burden of metastatic disease with innumerable bilateral pulmonary nodules.
Although no definite superimposed consolidation is identified, small area of infection would be difficult to exclude given burden of disease.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**8-15**] EKG: Supraventricular tachycardia at 145 beats per minute, likely an A-V nodal re-entrant tachycardia with pseudo S waves in leads II, III and aVF.
There is no pulmonary edema or new lung consolidation.
Diffuse pulmonary metastases, perhaps mildly decreased, with some lesions that appear cavitary.
[**8-15**] LENI: Conclusion:  No evidence of DVT in right or left lower extremity.
Possible developing pneumonia within the left lower lobe.
Widespread pulmonary nodules and lymphadenopathy consistent with metastatic disease.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 F with metastatic RCC, admitted initially for fever and pna, was treated for CAP, and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for acute tachycardia and hypotension.
===== ACTIVE ISSUES ======= # Hypotension/Tachycardia: During admission, patient had two episodes of acute onset narrow complex tachycardia and hypotension, with EKG concerning for SVNRT or AVRT.
CTA negative for PE, LENIs negative bilaterally, ECHO elatively normal (EF > 55%) without R heart strain.
# Volume overload: most likely secondary to fluid boluses though EF > 55% without diastolic dysfunction findings on echo.
Findings are suggestive of bilateral basal crackles along with slightly elevated JVP.
# Dyspnea: Clinical picture suggestive of infectious etiology, but imaging confounded by metastatic diseases in lungs.
She was treated with levofloxacin (day 1 [**8-14**]) for 5 days without clinical improvement.
Blood cultures showed no growth.
PE workup negative.
Possibly due to tumor burden with component of volume overload.
Progressive disease on CT chest with contrast on [**2177-7-22**].
# HLD - well controlled on simvastatin.

You were admitted with shortness of breath and fever.
You developed an abnormally fast heart rhythm and low blood pressure, for which you spent some time in the intensive care unit.
This medication, metoprolol succinate, can also cause low blood pressure, so it is very important that you let your doctors know if [**Name5 (PTitle) **] have symptoms like dizziness and lightheadedness.
STOP calcium supplements because your calcium level is somewhat high, probably due to your cancer  Please continue all other previously prescribed medications.
