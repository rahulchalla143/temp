[**Known lastname 12279**] is a 46 yo male with metastatic bladder cancer s/p cystectomy and ileal neobladder with disease progression on chemo who went to a urology clinic appt today for suprapubic discomfort, had a foley catheter placed and left in, with minimal urine output.
Urology felt that his obstruction was likely pre-renal in nature [**2-21**] poor PO intake, and not at the level of the urethra.
Patient's last chemotherapy dose was [**3-12**] and he feels he has been "the same" since then except that over the last week he has developed worsening suprapubic/abdominal pain and over the last day has felt nauseous with "dry heaves".
Does have some [**3-28**] dull aching pain at the site of the cellulitis.
He got vanc and cefepime for neutropenic hypothermia, and dilaudid for abdominal pain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
Past Medical History: # Bladder cancer: - [**3-/2173**]: diagnosed with bladder cancer with an invasive pT2b transitional cell carcinoma of mixed histology with adenocarcinoma and squamous cell cancer components following am TURBT.
- [**5-/2174**]: found to have a pelvic mass highly suspicious for recurrent disease, started on systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin at [**Hospital6 **].
He missed day eight of each cycle due to noncompliance.
However, he experienced symptomatic resolution of his pain following three cycles of chemotherapy, as well as radiographic improvement in his disease burden.
Due to a resurgence of his pain following three cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin, the patient wished to  receive further chemotherapy, but he was unable to receive chemotherapy at [**Hospital6 **] due to multiple urine toxicology screens positive for cocaine and other illicit substances.
- [**2175-6-8**] CT scan revealed an increase in the size of his left pelvic wall mass.
- [**2175-6-17**]: admitted to the hospital with repeat imaging demonstrating further progression of his disease.
By patient request, cycle 5 in [**8-/2175**] was held due to him having minimal symptoms from his disease.
- [**2175-10-18**] CT torso showing significant improvement in left pelvic wall mass but new L3 mass.
Rim-enhancing lesion in the posterior paravertebral muscles at L5, without extension into the spinal canal.
- [**2175-11-14**]: admitted with severe left groin pain - [**2175-11-15**] to [**2175-11-23**]: received radiation to L2 from L2-S1, total dose of [**2165**] cGy in 5 fractions.
- [**2175-12-6**], MRI of the right knee showing two mass-like abnormalities in the distal femur area.
- [**2175-12-15**], MRI of the thigh showing a lesion in the vastus intermedius measuring 5.2 x 2.7 x 2.2 cm, and a vastus medialis lesion measuring 4.3 x 2.6 x 2.2 cm.
These are both worrisome for metastatic cancer.
- [**2175-12-21**], core needle biopsy of thigh mass demonstrating poorly differentiated carcinoma consistent with known metastatic  bladder cancer.
- [**2176-1-4**]: LENIS: on the left there is occlusive thrombus identified extending inferiorly from the saphenofemoral junction  into the deep femoral vein.
- [**2176-1-5**]: CT torso and chest angio showing bilateral pulmonary  emboli in RML, RLL, LLL, disease progression with increased lymphadenopathy.
- [**2176-1-17**]:  CT abdomen and pelvis showing no intra-abdominal or pelvic hematoma.
There is interval enlargement of left-sided pelvic and paraspinal necrotic masses consistent with metastases.
The patient declined to come in for day eight dose of gemcitabine due to fatigue.
- [**2176-2-11**] CT angio of the chest: no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Previous filling defect has resolved.
No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes were seen.
- [**2176-2-19**] CT torso: No axillary or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
There are no worrisome nodules in the lungs.
Peritoneal nodules in the right paracolic gutter have increased in size compared to prior.
A hypoattenuating cystic mass in the left iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] is increased in size to 2.9 x 5.1 cm from 2.8 x 4.7 cm.
Left paraspinal cystic necrotic mass is decreased in size, measuring 2.7 x 1.9 cm versus 3.2 x 3.7 cm.
Prominent right inguinal and external iliac lymph nodes are increased in size, with the largest inguinal node measuring 3.0 x 1.4 cm versus 2.3 x 1.1 cm prior.
Acute inferolateral myocardial infarction, status post percutaneous intervention to the right coronary artery in 03/[**2174**].
Major depressive disorder, recurrent.
Posttraumatic stress disorder.
History of bladder cancer as noted above.
History of scoliosis with back pain 8.
Gunshot wound to the head in [**2149**] 9. bilat PEs & DVT in LLE in [**12-28**]   Social History: The patient is unemployed.
He has no history of STDs including HIV.
Family History: Significant for type 2 diabetes and hypertension in his grandparents.
The patient's mother died at age 39 of an MI and pulmonary failure and question of cancer.
His oncologic family history is significant for lung cancer in his uncle and lymph node cancer in one of his grandparents, uncle with throat cancer.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 12279**] is a 46 yo male with metastatic bladder cancer with disease progression on chemo who went to a urology clinic appt [**3-20**] for suprapubic discomfort, had a foley catheter placed with minimal urine output and was found to have hyperkalemia and [**Last Name (un) **] in the setting of neutropenia.
# [**Last Name (un) **]:  Renal function was 1.2 on [**2176-3-12**], and acutely elevated in the setting of bilateral obstruction.
On CT he has bilateral hydronephrosis which is the likely source of his [**Last Name (un) **].
Renal was consulted and felt that the procedure was indicated for palliation and improvement as a means to a bridge to home.
# Electrolyte Abnormalities: Likely related to [**Last Name (un) **] (see above).
He was written for sevelamer and he had repeat ekgs that showed improvement with his improvement in potassium  # Abdominal pain: He has had constipation without a BM x8 days.
He is also likely having discomfort from his obstructive kidney injury and suprapubic pain.
He was writted for an aggressive bowel regimen, and CT showed partial SBO.
His discomfort was largely associated with his constipation, and in an effort to make him have a BM, methylnaltrexone was given without effect.
After discussion with Oncology (given his neutropenia) it was felt the benefits outweighed the risks for using a suppository in an attempt to make him have a bowel movement, so he was given one still with no effect.
# Neutropenic hypothermia: The likely source is cellulitis on his righ thigh which has gone untreated since mid-[**Month (only) 956**].
# Metastatic Bladder Cancer: Disease progressing despite chemotherapy.
# Hx of DVT/PE's: Left DVT and bilateral PE's in [**12-28**].
