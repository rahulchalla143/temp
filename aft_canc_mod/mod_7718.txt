Admission Date:  [**2120-6-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2120-6-14**]  Date of Birth:   [**2062-3-7**]     Sex:  M   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 58 year-old male with past medical history of prostate cancer, status post radical prostatectomy and hairy-cell leukemia status post treatment with 2 CdA last does on [**2120-6-1**] who presented on from [**2120-5-31**] to [**2120-6-5**] the patient had a PIC line associated thrombophlebitis with MRSA.
The patient was treated with Vancomycin which was later switched to Linezolid secondary to rash with Vancomycin.
The patient was discharged home with temperatures of approximately 100 F.  The day after admission, the patient had a rise in associated cough, chest tightness and diarrhea.
The  Linezolid was continued for completion of previous course.
CT scan of the chest and abdomen were ordered for better evaluation of the lungs and new onset abdominal pain.
The patient reports that since the last admission he has had a nonproductive cough and increasing shortness of breath that is worse when lying down.
He also reports some mild diarrhea and "searing calf pain" that was initially bilateral then left greater than right which resolved spontaneously.
The patient also reports continued fever and an unusual amount of fatigue.
Hairy-cell leukemia diagnosed in [**2113**] treated with 2 CdA.
On [**6-8**] the patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for pancytopenia then followed by Drs.
Treatment was complicated by PIC line associated septic thrombophlebitis treated with Vancomycin initially which was then changed to Linezolid due to diffuse macular papular rash.
History of prostate adenocarcinoma status post radical prostatectomy.
Status post hernia repair.
Questionable reaction to Oxicillin and Allopurinol as these were all given at the same time Vancomycin was given and is questionable whether these were responsive for the patient's initial rash.
Intolerance to Codeine which causes nausea and vomiting.
Morphine causes mental status changes.
In general the patient is chronically ill appearing, slightly shortness of breath and pale.
HEENT - no thrush.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Lungs - decreased breath sounds at left base, dullness to percussion at left base, decreased lung volume secondary to the patient's inability to take a deep breath.
Abdomen - distended, positive bowel sounds.
Diffuse tenderness to palpation no guarding or rebound.
Extremities - left lower extremity slightly larger than right lower extremity.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 58 year-old male with hairy-cell leukemia admitted for fever, hypotension and acute onset of shortness of breath.
Fever and hypotension - Infectious Disease was consulted during this admission.
Ceftazidine was discontinued when the patient was no longer neutropenic and the patient was started on Levaquin for coverage of community acquired pneumonia.
There was low suspicion by the Infectious Disease team for PCP in this patient.
Infectious Disease at first was concerned over a possible fungal infection.
However CT scan of the chest did not reveal any cavitary lesions and the patient did not worsen.
No antifungal medications were started during this hospitalization and it was thought there was low probability the patient had a fungal lung infection due to his clinical improvement without any treatment.
A chest x-ray revealed a left retrocardiac density which could be either consolidation versus atelectasis.
Considering that the patient had fevers and a cough it was thought most likely that this consolidation likely represented a pneumonia.
At the time of this dictation the patient was afebrile for 24 hours.
The patient will be discharged home on Levaquin to complete a 14 day course to cover for community acquire pneumonia and any atypicals.
There has been no obvious source for the patient's fevers at this time.
Cardiac - Because of the enlarged cardiac silhouette seen on chest x-ray and hypotension, an echocardiogram was done to evaluate for ejection fraction.
The echocardiogram revealed surprisingly global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25% and 2+ MR.
The patient had no previous history of any cardiac disease.
It was thought unlikely that the patient had myocarditis due to the relative low cardiac enzymes.
The patient did have a slight Troponin leak with Troponin max of 2.3.
The patient was started on treatment for congestive heart failure with Lasix, Captopril, and Carvedilol.
Pulmonary - Upon admission to the OMED service there was concern for pulmonary embolus however a CTA was done which did not reveal any pulmonary embolus.
There were bilateral pleural effusions seen left greater than right and atelectasis.
The patient's hypoxia improved with diuresis and treatment of possible pneumonia with Levaquin.
Gastrointestinal - The patient had acute transaminitis with liver enzymes that rose to an ALT of 722 and AST 348.
It was thought that the patient may have suffered from shock liver secondary to hypotension or liver congestion secondary to new onset CHF.
If diarrhea continues as an outpatient, the patient will seek further evaluation.
New onset cardiomyopathy complicated by congestive heart failure, complicated by hypotension.
Hairy-cell leukemia status post treatment with 2 CdA complicated by neutropenia.
