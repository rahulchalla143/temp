Complex fracture of the right femoral neck and intertrochanteric region.
Complex fracture of the left femoral neck.
Bilateral complex supracondylar fractures.
Bilateral hemarthrosis of the knees.
Subcutaneous soft tissue hematoma tracking along bilateral thigh.
Severe osteopenia.
Degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine, SI and hip joints.
Suprapubic Foley catheter in the urinary bladder and air in the urinary bladder, presumably from catheter placement; correlate clinically.
Multiple maxillofacial fractures including the posterior sphenoid sinus, anterior and posterior frontal sinus, ethmoidal air cells, nasal bone, medial wall of the right maxillary sinus and anterior wall of the left maxillary sinus and nasal bones .
The bones are diffusely demineralized which makes identification of any additional fractures difficult to exclude.
Small foci of pneumocephalus posterior to the right frontal sinus.
An underlying dural tear and CSF leak cannot be excluded.
Diffuse intracranial hemorrhage better characterized on concurrent head CT.  CT Head [**10-8**]: 1.
Slightly increased small extra-axial hematoma overlying the left frontal lobe convexity and possible small secondary frontal hematoma noted on the right.
Stable bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage layering around the bifrontal and temporal lobes and extending into the suprasellar, prepontine and interpeduncular cisterns with indentation on the pons.
Likely anterior maxillary and nasal bone fractures better evaluated on subsequent maxillofacial CT. Opacification of the paranasal sinuses likely related to blood.
Subgaleal hematoma overlying the right frontal bone.
CT Head [**10-8**]: No significant change compared to study performed approximately 12 hours prior.
Multifocal subarachnoid, subdural, or intraventricular hemorrhage is redemonstrated, as is a contusion involving the left inferior frontal lobe.
Extensive facial fractures with blood in the paranasal sinuses was better characterized on prior dedicated facial bones CT.
There is again no midline shift or evidence of central brain herniation.
No obvious focus of marrow edema in the cervical vertebrae.
Multilevel, multifactorial degenerative changes, with adequate assessment is significantly limited on the axial images, due to motion-related artifacts.
Vague areas of cord signal intensity are noted, inadequately assessed on the present study.
Areas of altered signal intensity in the thecal sac may relate to blood products/pulsation artifacts or a combination of both given the presence of subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage on prior CT head study.
Acute compression fracture of the T3 vertebral body, with buckling of the posterior cortex, the inferior aspect of which is displaced posteriorly by approximately 3 mm.
Suspected T2 vertebral body fracture (seen on concurrent cervical spine MRI) is not apparent by CT. 2.
While as detailed above these may be chronic, given the concurrent acute injury in the upper thoracic spine, it is difficult to exclude an acute component.
Areas of marrow edema in the T2 and T3 vertebral bodies, with mild contour irregularity of the posterior cortex of T3 which is seen to indent the ventral thecal sac and the ventral surface of the cord.
Mild diffuse disc bulge, with small-to-moderate sized disc extrusion, on the right side deforming the right side of the cord at T7/8.
Small central protrusion at T6-T7 level indenting the ventral thecal sac and ventral cord.
Moderate loss of height T12 vertebral body with Schmorl's nodes, likely chronic.
Mild-to-moderate loss of height of the L1 vertebral body, with a Schmorl's node with an acute component of marrow edema in the L1 vertebral body.
Multilevel disc and facet degenerative changes in the lumbar spine with mild foraminal narrowing at L4 and L5 levels.
Diffusely altered signal intensity in the thecal sac, may relate to pulsation artifacts; however, blood products cannot be completely excluded given the presence of subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage on the prior CT head study.
Vague areas of increased signal intensity in the thoracic cord, nature of which is uncertain.
Assessment of cord lesions is limited due to artifacts.
Bilateral pleural effusions and distended gall bladder -correlate with dedicated imaging.
Minimal increase of the intraventricular hemorrhage layering in the occipital horns.
No shift of midline structures and no intracranial herniation.
PATHOLOGY: [**2122-10-8**]: Bone, left femoral head, hemiarthroplasty: - Bone and cartilage with changes consistent with fracture site.
- Bone marrow with an atypical lymphoid infiltrate, consistent with known history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Neuro: At baseline patient is wheelchair bound secondary to MS. Cognitive baseline is described as mentally sharp with ability to do crossword puzzles.
CT head obtained on admission demonstrated traumatic brain injury (left frontal subdural hematoma and scattered frontotemporal subarachnoid hemorrhage).
CV: Patient demonstrated sinus tachycardia on admission to TSICU.
At time of discharge patient is on stable dose of metoprolol with no cardiac issues.
Given inability to wean from ventilatory support a tracheostomy was placed [**10-14**].
At time of discharge patient tolerating T-piece supplemental oxygen with persistent requirement for Q2-3 hour suctioning/pulmonary toilet.
Following initial resuscitation lasix was utilized to assist in diuresis of massive volume previously required for cardiovascular support.
MSK: Patient sustained bilateral proximal and distal fractures of the femur that were repaired by orthopedics as per above [**10-8**].
Patient was noted to have thoracic spine fractures as above.
Facial fractures were evaluated by plastic surgery.
Patient was transfused 4 pRBC prior to arrival in TSICU related to refractory hypotension at OSH.
[**10-9**] hematocrit was persistently low without appropriate increases seen on prior day's transfusions.
They recommended further workup of hematologic malignancy if patient manifested symptoms of hematologic dysfunction which she did not.
An IVC filter was placed [**10-14**] given likelihood of protracted immobility and multiple orthopedic injuries.
A HIT panel was sent for concern of low platelets during this admission and this was found to be negative.
ID: Patient had recently completed a course of antibiotics for UTI at time of admission.
At time of discharge patient is completing 14 day course of vancomycin and fluconazole and had been afebrile for over 72 hours.
At the time of discharge on [**2122-10-23**], the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating enteral feeding, bedbound, voiding via suprapubic catheter, and pain was well controlled.
9. glucagon (human recombinant) 1 mg Recon Soln Sig: One (1) mg Recon Soln Injection Q15MIN () as needed for hypoglycemia protocol.
11. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
13. bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
16. dextrose 50% in water (D50W)     Syringe Sig: 12.5 g Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for hypoglycemia protocol.
