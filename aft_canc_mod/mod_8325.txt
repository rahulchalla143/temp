History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 3708**] is a lovely 68 year-old female who initially presented to her dentist when she had noticed a fractured right lower wisdom tooth, and this was associated with gum changes.
Pathology from this procedure, which was performed on [**2116-6-10**], showed tumor cells that were reactive for HMB-45, MART-1 and S1-100, consistent with malignant melanoma.
She underwent a CT scan of the head with contrast, which showed no evidence of metastatic disease and a CT Abdomen/Pelvis with contrast, which revealed no evidence of metastatic disease.
On [**2116-7-1**] she was seen in Multidisciplinary Cutaneous [**Hospital **] Clinic for evaluation of her malignant melanoma of the oral cavity, by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
She has had a CT scan of the sinus and neck with contrast on [**2116-7-9**] which showed a soft tissue mass centered in the right maxillary alveolar ridge with extension via the gingivobuccal sulcus into the buccal mucosa and also soft tissue extension into the retromolar trigone on the right.
There was a large defect in the anteroinferior wall of the right maxillary sinus.
The patient was seen in clinic and noted she felt well and had no specific complaints.
Past Medical History: Mucosal melanoma of the oral cavity, status post myocardial infarction in [**2084**] and had no further cardiac trouble since, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, status post Left breast mass excision, status post exploratory laparotomy (unclear reason)   Social History: She lives with her husband with whom she has been married for 48 years.
Mother had hepatocellular carcinoma and her father died of "natural causes."
There is no family history of mucosal or cutaneous melanoma.
She has a 73-year-old sister who is reasonably well.
Right transfacial incision is clean, dry and well-approximated with no evidence of drainage or infection.
Her right cervical neck incision is clean, dry and well-approximated with no evidence of neck flap hematoma and no erythema or drainage.
Cranial nerves VII on the right with marginal mandibular branch weakness and buccal branch weakness, noted post-op.
No difficulty with eye closure.
CVS: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur, rub or gallop.
No adventitious wheezing, rhonchi or rales.
EXTR: 2+ peripheral pulses with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Right thigh STSG donor site clean and dry with minimal serosanguinous drainage and xeroform with tegaderm placed as dressing.
Pertinent Results: [**2116-8-12**] 03:44AM BLOOD WBC-12.9* RBC-3.68* Hgb-11.6* Hct-33.7* MCV-92 MCH-31.5 MCHC-34.4 RDW-13.3 Plt Ct-175  [**2116-8-12**] 03:44AM BLOOD Glucose-147* UreaN-12 Creat-0.7 Na-139 K-4.2 Cl-104 HCO3-25 AnGap-14  [**2116-8-12**] 03:44AM BLOOD Calcium-8.4 Phos-3.5 Mg-2.2  [**2116-8-14**]: CXR There is significant elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, chronicity undetermined and might reflect paralysis of the right hemidiaphragm, please correlate with surgery and the potential for damage to phrenic nerve.
There is no appreciable pneumothorax demonstrated.
[**2116-8-15**]: CXRThere is no change in the opacification of the right lower lung that as previously described most likely consistent with elevation of right hemidiaphragm and less likely atelectasis (potentially partial).
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable and there is no evidence of appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: NEURO/PAIN/INCISION: Given the need to sacrifice the maxillary division of cranial nerve V, the patient's post-operative pain was minimal.
She did note some post-op pain at her incision.
On exam post-op she had weakness in the marginal mandibular and buccal branches of her right facial nerve.
Her incision at the right neck was stable post-op with no evidence of erythema, infection or hematoma collection.
Erythromycin ophthalamic was applied to the right eye for antibiotic prophylaxis, given that operative incision was near the right globe.
She had some episodic and intermittent desaturations to the 88-90% range but had no respiratory complaints.
We started Atrovent nebs INH, incentive spirometry, encouraged ambulation and completed a CXR on POD#3 which showed some evidence of Right hemidiaphgram elevation.
ENDORCINE: The patient received Decadron for prophylaxis against airway swelling in the OR, but required no post-op steroids.
She remained afebrile post-op.
These drains had minimal serosanguinous output.
Discharge Instructions: Seek immediate medical attention for fever >101.5, chills, increased redness, swelling or discharge from incision, chest pain, shortness of breath, or anything else that is troubling you.
No strenuous exercise or heavy lifting until follow up appointment, at least.
