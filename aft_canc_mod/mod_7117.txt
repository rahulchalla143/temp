Admission Date:  [**2136-6-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-7-4**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**] Chief Complaint: Bilateral leg pain, SOB, and diarrhea transfered from [**Location (un) **] with elevated LFTs.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 81 y/o M w/CAD s/p CABG, CHF who presented to an OSH with progressive L-leg pain x 2 weeks to the point that pt was unable to ambulate today.
Pt also reports SOB and diarrhea x 2-3 days.
When pt was found to have "blast" immature forms on periph smear, pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further therapy.
Given borderline respiratory status, pt was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Pt reports LE pain that is "shooting" from LEs up; worse w/ambulation, keeping pt up at night.
Pt denies back pain, lower extrem weakness or numbness, and urinary or bowel symptoms.
+Diarrhea x 2-3 days but pt denies abdominal pain, N/V, BRBPR, or melena.
Pt had Guiac positive stools on admission.
Past Medical History: -CAD: s/p CABG x2 [**2112**], [**2133**] -CHF: Echo ([**3-22**] @ [**Location (un) **]) w/EF 50%, inferobasilar HK, mild MR  -HTN -hypercholesterolemia -COPD on home inhalers but no home O2 -prostate CA, s/p TURP -colonic perforation [**2134**] s/p sigmoid resection (at [**Location (un) **]) -carotid artery stenosis s/p CEA in [**2130**] -h/o hyperparathyroidism, asymptomatic; seen in hospitalization in [**2133**] -s/p bilateral hernia repairs   Social History: 50 pack-yr TOB; lives with wife; retired truck driver  Family History: N/C  Physical Exam: (on admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]) -VS: 107/44, 72r, R22, 93% RA -Gen: Obese elderly male in mild respir distress.
-Skin: C/D/I, no rashes appreciated -HEENT: FM in place; dry MM; EOMI, conjunctiva clear, anicteric sclera -Heart: S1 S2 RRR, no murmurs appreciated -Lungs: diffuse expir wheezes; minimal bibasilar crackles; fair air movement -Back: no costovertebral tenderness; no spinal tenderness -Abdom: soft, obese, NT, ND; surgical incision scars w/hernias -Extrem: pitting edema in bilat LEs to mid-calf; 1+ DP pulses -Neuro: alert, oriented to person & place; follows commands; answers ?s appropriately but somewhat poor historian.
-ABG: 7.43 | 35 | 60 on 5L NC -UA: trace blood, otherwise negative -CXR: (prelim): no infiltrates but L-heart border somewhat indistinct; slight volume overload; possible pleural effusion on lateral film   Brief Hospital Course: During [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay, pt was initially on 95% face mask, which was titrated to 5L NC.
Hypoxia was thought to be multifactorial secondary to COPD exacerbation, aggressive IVF hydration, ?CHF in setting of IVF.
However, echo and MUGA showed EF 61% with moderate pulm art systolic htn.
Pt was concurrently given IVF hydration and Lasix for diuresis for CHF.
Pt presented with acute renal failure thought secondary to uric acid nephropathy vs. rhabdomyalysis.
Had tn leak, likely on setting of renal failure.
Etiology of initial presentation of left leg pain was not found.
Pt had no evidence of neurologic compromise and leg pain improved.
Hypoxia: Pt's hypoxia is most likely multifactorial in etiology secondary to COPD exacerbation, CHF in the secondary of aggressive IVF, and possible underlying OSA.
Serial CXR showed improvement in bilateral pleural effusions.
CXR did not show any evidence of pneumonia; there was no clinical evidence of pneumonia.
Pt was treated for COPD exacerbation on steroids, standing albuterol and atrovent nebs, and azithromycin.
Pt had evidence of moderate pulmonary hypertension on echo, which may be secondary to left heart failure (perhaps diastolic, since the echo showed preserved EF).
Heme/Onc - After serial cbc/differential, it was felt that pt has MDS with blasts secondary to reactive marrow.
Pt has 15% blasts on his bone marrow biopsy, which does not quality for acute leukemia.
Also, he showed evidence of steadily decreasing blast count on serial differentials.
Pt should have his MDS and blast count closely followed by an outpatient hematology/oncologist to look for acute leukemic transformation.
Pt was admitted with a signficantly elevated uric acid level, LDH in the setting of hemolysis for which he was given IV hydration and allopurinol with subsequent normalization.
Pt was noted to have steadily decreasing platelet counts.
The differential for pt's thrombocytopenia included MDS, HIT, less likely drug related (on Lasix).
No evidence of DIC; HIT antibody is pending.
Renal Failure: Pt was admitted in acute renal failure thought to be secondary to uric acid nephropathy.
Less likely etiology is rhabdomyalysis (peak of 1500).
Aspirin was held in setting of low plt and increased INR.
Leg Pain - Initial concern for nerve compression or blastoma.
However, pain resolved without intervention or need for imaging.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for dyspnea.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: MDS with reactive blasts ARF (likely [**2-22**] uric acid nephropathy) ?Rhabdomyalosis CHF exacerbation COPD exacerbation Thrombocytopenia   Discharge Condition: Stable on 2.5L O2  Discharge Instructions: If you develop fevers, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, bleeding, or any other concerning symptoms call your primary care doctor or return to the emergency room immediately.
