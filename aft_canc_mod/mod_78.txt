Admission Date:  [**2103-9-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2103-10-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2058-7-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bleomycin / Bactrim  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: Fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 45 yo M with a long history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p auto and allogeneic transplant with recurrence on monthly chemotherapy admitted after he presented for scheduled chemotherapy with fevers to 101 in clinic and transferred to the ICU for persistent hypotension after bronchoscopy.
He was found to have a fever to 101.
On review of systems at that time the patient did admit to feeling fatigued and generally unwell possibly with a component of pleuritic chest pain and dry cough.
CXR at that time revealed an evolving RLL and lingular/LUL infiltrate.
He was admitted for further evaluation with CXR and CT chest concerning for evolving pneumonia.
During his hospital stay, the patient did have relative hypotension as at baseline to the range of sbp 90's with tachycardia to the low 100's.
The patient did have individual sbp measurements overnight prior to transfer as low as 80's, reportedly fluid responsive.
Post-procedure the patient was persistently hypotensive to the range of sbp 78-82 with intact mentation though some complaints of feeling tired and mildly lightheaded.
Of note, the patient has a history of multiple episodes of pneumonia in the past most recently with fungal pnuemonia based upon positive galactomannan in [**1-6**].
Notes mild pleuritic chest pain and nausea.
No emesis, abdominal pain, diarrhea, brbpr, urinary complaints.
Past Medical History: Past medical/surgical history: Hodgkin's disease (see below) Hypothyroidism Asthma s/p biliary stent (see below) Hepatitis B core+ .
Diagnosed with stage IIB Hodgkin's lymphoma in 12/99, completed ABVD for four cycles with the last 1 [**1-31**] cycles without bleomycin due to pulmonary toxicity, followed by consolidative mantle radiation therapy.
Transplant complicated by liver GVHD confirmed by a biopsy on [**2099-1-11**] treated with prednisone.
Evidence for recurrent disease and status post a donor lymphocyte infusion on [**2099-7-2**] with a second one on [**2099-9-9**].
Further progression of his disease in [**10-4**] and treated with ESHAP x 2 cycles on [**2099-10-16**] and [**2099-11-17**].
Outpatient regimen of Rituxan and gemcitabine with unfortunately progressive symptoms and then followed with two more cycles of ESHAP in [**Month (only) 958**] and [**2100-4-30**] with an excellent response to therapy.
Further progression of his disease over several months with particularly increasing abdominal involvement and treated with another cycle of ESHAP in [**4-5**].
Treated with CEP chemotherapy on [**2101-6-8**] with a donor lymphocyte infusion on [**2101-6-29**] at 1 x 108 T cells per kilogram with marked GVHD of the liver with increased transaminases and bilirubin requiring CellCept and prednisone with eventual resolution.
Also requiring periodic thoracenteses of now recurrent pleural effusions.
Presented in [**6-6**] with increased liver function tests and bilirubin with infiltration of the pancreatic head with intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Treated with Day 1,2,3 only of CEP starting on [**2102-6-30**] with evidence for disease response on CT scan from [**2102-7-21**].
Rescanned in [**9-6**] with progression of disease and then received two more cycles of CEP on [**2102-9-7**] and [**2102-10-10**] with CT scan on [**2102-11-8**] with response to therapy.
Consideration of another DLI, but developed progression of disease with recurrent hydronephrosis.
D8 held due to low counts.
During this admission, also had thoracentesis for pleural effusions.
HEENT: NCAT, PERRL, EOMI, no scleral icterus, MMM, no lesions noted in OP Neck: supple, no significant JVD or carotid bruits appreciated Pulmonary: L sided rales up to inferior edge of scapula, CTA on right Cardiac: RR, nl S1 S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated Abdomen: soft, NT, ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted Extremities: No edema, 2+ radial, DP pulses b/l Lymphatics: No cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy noted  Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Overall improving patchy ground-glass opacities within the lungs bilaterally.
Slight increased opacities involving anterior right upper and right middle lobes.
Findings again suggestive of infection.
Slight decrease in size of right lower lobe mass.
Tiny perihepatic ascites.
Slight improvement in some regions of consolidation within the lungs, although there is increased ground-glass opacity seen in the upper lobe of both the right and left lungs.
This may be secondary in part to regions of improving aeration when compared to prior consolidation, although some regions which appear to have worsening ground-glass opacity may be secondary to atypical infection including processes such as PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] other infectious/inflammatory processes.
These presumably may be secondary to Hodgkin involvement, and while somewhat more prominent than on prior examination, they do not appear to be new.
Moderately severe narrowing of the splenic vein, without total occlusion at this time.
In addition, there is moderate-to-severe narrowing of the mid portal vein as well.
Diffuse regeneration of the crypts, consistent with a healing process (see note).
No viral inclusions, granulomas or tumor seen.
Immunostain is negative for CMV with satisfactory control.
Markedly hypocellular marrow with left-shifted myelopoiesis, dysmegakaryopoesis, and mild eosinophilia, see note.
No Hodgkin lymphoma seen.
Note: Overall the findings are suggestive of acute marrow injury from secondary causes such as medications, toxic/metabolic, immune insult etc.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT: 45-year-old man with a history of Hodgkin's disease status post multiple disease relapses after auto and allo SCT, most recently treated with Gemzar, Navelbine and Decadron on 30 day cycle, who presented with fever to 101 prior to chemotherapy administration.
## Fever/Pneumonia: CT findings suggested pneumonia as source of fevers.
Beacause of concern for sepsis, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for bronchoscopy which revealed thick white secretions c/w pna.
Small blood in one of BAL samples was likely due to trauma.
Post bronchoscopy CXR showed slight worsening of RLL infiltrate.
The patient had a repeat bronchoscopy on [**10-8**], with BAL cultures showing just oropharyngial flora and no PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] remained afebrile off antibiotics prior to discharge.
Pt continued home salmeterol and albuterol for asthma .
He had a history of chronic steroid use which had been discontinued.
It was felt that his hypotension was possibly due to adrenal insufficiency and he was restarted on stress dose steroids with marked improvement in hemodynamic response.
Pt became nauseated and did not take prednisone or other oral meds and was noted to have additional episodes of hypotension [**Date range (1) 3923**].
## Diarrhea: [**10-9**], pt reported having several loose stools.
He was started on flagyl with concern for c. difficile.
## Acute Renal Failure:  On [**10-7**], pt was noted to have a non-gap metabolic acidosis with a creatinine of 1.5.
## Hodgkin's lymphoma: The patient had a history of multiple relapses.
However, there was concern that renal failure, diarrhea and rising LDH may be related, however renal and GI biopsies were not consistent with lymphoma.
# Hypotension.
Hemodynamically stable; thought to be due to adrenal insufficiency.
Was stable but had additional hypotension on [**10-8**] so was restated on high dose steroids- now on 10 mg methylprednisolone daily.
# HBV core Ab positive.
[**10-19**] TPN initiated due to poor PO intake.
# Access: L portocath .
