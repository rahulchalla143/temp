Admission Date:  [**2127-7-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-7-30**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Augmentin / Keflex / Cephalosporins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4095**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension, Acute on chronic kidney injury  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 88M with history of CAD s/p CABG with CHF (EF 25%) s/p BiV ICD, COPD (vital capacity was 1.22 liters, 48% predicted; FEV1 is 0.97 liters, 54% predicted, FEV1/FVC ratio is 79%), HTN and multiple recent pneumonias admitted with hypotension.
Per patient, he is asymptommatic, family states he was dizzy with decreased Po intake for past 4 days.
On the floor, patient with no complaints.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past Medical History: - CAD with multiple MIs - Severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF of 25% with biventricular failure.
- Mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
- History of LV thrombus.
- CVA(right medial occipital pareital region).
- Pneumonia.
- Glaucoma.
- War injury with a left lower leg deformity.
- Hx of Splenectomy c/b ureteral injury & reimplantation  Social History: -Russian-speaking, originally from [**Location (un) 25508**].
Lungs: Bibasilar crackles L>R, minimal dullness to percussion over left posterior lung base.
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, minimally distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: foley in place Ext: pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities, slightly greater on left distal to previous traumatic leg injury (healed).
+ fungal growth on toe nails Skin: + chronic venous stasis changes in bilateral LE .
Left lower lobe atelectasis.
[**7-28**] CXR: Compared to [**2127-6-10**], both diaphragm contours and the infrahilar regions of both lungs were clear, there is opacification in both locations today, not appreciably changed since [**7-23**].
Whether this is pneumonia or atelectasis or even early dependent edema is radiographically indeterminate.
There is greater pulmonary vascular engorgement on the current study than there was on [**6-10**], so there may be a component of cardiac decompensation.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are also likely.
Severe cardiomegaly and marked hilar dilatation due to pulmonary arterial hypertension are longstanding.
Transvenous right atrial pacer and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads follow their expected courses, unchanged.
No pneumothorax.

ACTIVE ISSUES: # Hypotension due to Intravascular Depletion - Differential included heart failure, intravascular volume depletion [**2-19**] poor PO intake, and sepsis [**2-19**] possible pneumonia.
Pt had no fever, and a chronically elevated WBC and a CXR without obvious pna.
Intravascular volume depletion from overdiuresis was favored, and the patient received gentle rehydration and his blood pressure improved while in the ICU.
(Please see below for CHF Management) .
# Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury Stage [**Name (NI) 25509**] - Pt presented with Cr 2.0 in setting of diuresis and poor PO intake, baseline 1.2-1.4.
# Hyponatremia - Thought to be most likely hypovolemic hyponatremia.
# Chronic Systolic CHF - EF 25%, on lasix/spironolactone with metolazone weekly.
Currently with some peripheral edema, BNP elevated at 2600 - recent baseline ~[**2116**].
His beta blocker was continued, and his ACI-i was held given his acute renal failure.
On room air with sats ~93 with bilateral basilar rales.
# Chronic Leukocytosis - Pt with hx of chronic with eosinophilia, IgE elevated, ANCA negative, strongy negative.
This was thought to be less likely related to acute infection given chronic nature.
Cortisol was checked to rule out adrenal insufficiency as etiology, but cortisol level was appropriate.
INACTIVE ISSUES: # CAD - stable.
# COPD - no e/o acute exacerbation, continued advair,  nebs.
# Squamous cell carcinoma - Recent diagnosis.
12. ipratropium bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
14. nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Sublingual As needed as needed for chest pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: # Hypotension/Hypovolemia # ARF on CKD stage II-III (baseline 1.2-1.3) # hypovolemic hyponatremia # chronic sCHF # leukocytosis, chronic with eosinophilia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with low blood pressure which appears to be due to dehydration from your diuretics and not drinking enough fluids.
