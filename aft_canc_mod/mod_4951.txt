At that time she had no retention of urine however she had occasional constipation that was felt to be related to opiod pain medications, also she was having episodes of confusion.
She states that the urinary retention and constipation have been almost constant since discharge and that her weakness has progressively worsened.
Of note, her discharge summary stated that she had no urinary or fecal issues and that her LLE was 5-/5 throughout in regards to her motor strength examination.
Today she reports urinary retention and constipation as above as well as sensation deficit of the LLE.
She denies saddle anesthesia and states she knows when she has to urinate or defecate but simply can not produce either.
Past Medical History: - HTN - HLD - DMII   Social History: She lives with her 3 children.
Family History: Multiple family members with DM, no history of stroke known.
Motor: [**6-3**] RUE and LUE, [**6-3**] RLE, 4+ L IP, 5 Q, 4+ H, 5 AT, [**Last Name (un) 938**], GS  Toes downgoing bilaterally   Pertinent Results: [**2156-9-4**] MRI THORACIC SPINE W/O CONTRAST IMPRESSION: The previously noted intradural extramedullary mass in the thoracic spine at T4-T5 level is again identified.
The edema identified within the spinal cord superior to the level of the mass appears to have slightly more prominent compared to the prior study.
It is unclear whether this is secondary to increasing edema or differences in technique.
It is unclear whether this is patient's baseline or there remains dilatation of both the baseline.
Brief Hospital Course: On [**2156-9-4**] Ms. [**Known lastname 89244**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from rehab fascility due to increased left lower extremity weakness, urinary retention and constipation.
She was taken to the OR on that date for laminectomies of T4-T5 and resection of her intradural, extramedullary mass that was found on MRI scan of the thoracic spine which was obtained during her prior admission.
The original plan had been to remove this mass at the end of the month after she had made some recovery from her hydrocephalus and VP shunt placement.
However, given her new neurological deficit it was necessary to remove this lesion before the mass could cause further neurological damage.
The decision was made intraoperatively to sacrifice the exiting posterior nerve root at the T4-T5 level to achieve complete tumor resection.
Her dressing remained dry and she had no headaches.
