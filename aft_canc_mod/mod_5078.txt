Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 68286**] Admission Date: [**2135-4-19**] Discharge Date: [**2135-4-30**] Date of Birth:  [**2087-3-21**] Sex:  M Service:  MED   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 48-year-old male who was well known to the surgery service having had a malignant pheochromocytoma resected in [**2134-8-20**].
At the time he had multiple small liver metastases and a very large malignant pheochromocytoma.
The patient represented to [**Location (un) **] in late [**Month (only) 547**] with distention and difficulty having bowel movements.
He was also found to have hypoxia based on shunting.
No pulmonary embolism was found.
There was some question as to whether he had a small bowel obstruction.
At this point, the patient had been transferred to the ICU because of difficulty breathing.
We were hoping to do colonoscopy with the patient intubated but the GI service felt that was probably not an option given his tenuous state.
Lysis of adhesions showed a transition point in the mid jejunum with some lysis of adhesions but this did not appear to be the cause for his bowel obstruction.
The patient developed acute renal failure requiring dialysis.
By [**4-24**], the patient had worsening chest x- ray consistent with pneumonia.
The decision was made to try to a Gastrografin enema both for diagnosis and treatment as recommended by the GI service.
The patient continued to be somewhat unstable but was unable to maintain his ventilatory status without intubation.
By [**4-27**] he had a couple of small bowel movements after the Gastrografin enema and the NG tube was removed because of lack of output and discomfort.
Unfortunately by [**4-28**] the patient continued to do poorly and we felt that we had to do a decompressive laparotomy for his pseudoobstruction with high bladder pressures.
On the beginning of the operation he desaturated and the feeling was that he probably had an endobronchial on the right and a left chest tube was placed and the endotracheal tube was pulled back.
Decompressive laparotomy showed massive dilated loops of bowel without specific obstruction.
After this operation, the patient continued to deteriorate with worsening respiratory status.
The patient continued to require high-dose pressors without much response.
A family meeting was held with the patient's wife and they decided that given his current status and his underlying condition, that they would proceed with comfort measures only.
Metastatic pheochromocytoma.
Renal failure.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome.
