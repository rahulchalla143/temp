Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
There has been slight interval worsening in asymmetric moderate pulmonary edema, worse in the right side.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
[**2140-2-15**]: Mild cardiomegaly has increased.
There is mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema asymmetric on the right, with more dense consolidation in the right lower lobe.
There is no pneumothorax.
If any, there is small right pleural effusion.
There are low lung volumes.
The patient is post-median sternotomy and CABG.
Left atrial abnormality.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2139-5-27**] the rate has increased, atrial ectopy has appeared and there is ST segment depression in leads I, II, aVL and V3-V6 consistent with inferolateral ischemic process.
Atrial ectopy has abated.
The ST segment depression persists.
No diagnostic interim change.

There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-30**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is Q-T interval prolongation.
Atrial ectopy has reappeared and the ischemic appearing ST segment changes persist.
Pulmonary edema has substantially cleared.
No sizable pleural effusion is identified.
There is no pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 yo M w/ CAD s/p CABG, mult PCI, mod AS, angina, prostate CA, admitted with NSTEMI, CHF, PNA, and acute on chronic renal failure.
# CHF: Pt was found to have NSTEMI with pulmonary edema.
Pt's hypoxia required NRB and was admitted to MICU for observation and iv lasix.
Repeat echo on [**2-17**] revealed a new decreased EF of 40% as well as a mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis likely [**1-30**] NSTEMI.
# NSTEMI: Pt has had periodic anginal pain which is chronic per his daughter, and he has a known occluded [**Name (NI) 9545**].
Pt ruled in for NSTEMI and was seen cardiology who recommended medical management and daughter and pt.
Pt received heparin gtt briefly but was stopped due to hematuria liekly [**1-30**] to traumatic foley insertion.
Pt remained chest pain free on the floor.
# RLL PNA: Likely contributed to hypoxia in addition to pulmonary edema.
Levofloxacin was started at the time of admission for community acquired pneumonia and finished a 7 day course.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: His baseline creatinine is around 1.3-1.5.
had significant urinary retention/prostate cA which probably caused ARF as well as poor flow due to CHF.
Pt has known bph and prostate ca, with urinary retention in the past.
Hematuria eventually resolved after d/cing heparin and hct remained stable.
He has an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**] (urology) on [**2140-2-25**] to decide on further treatment (i.e TURP) or continuing foley.
# Anemia: He had hematuria but hct remained stable.
His iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
# HTN: continued BB and then later re-started ace-I when creatinine normalized.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 9475**] Care Center - [**Location (un) 3146**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: NSTEMI Congestive heart failure Community acquired pneumonia Acute renal failure- resolved  Secondary diagnoses: Hypertension Dementia Prostate cancer Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Stable, satting 97-99% on RA   Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor or report to emergency room if you develop chest pain not relieved with nitroglycerin, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fevers, chills or any other worrisome symptoms.
We added levofloxacin for pneumonia and started simvastatin for your cholesterol and heart disease.
