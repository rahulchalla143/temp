On the day prior to discharge, the patient had an elective colonoscopy that revealed multiple diverticulosis throughout his colon, as well as several polyps.
He had no further evidence of bleeding while he was on the floor, and it was impossible to localize the bleeding.
Of note, the patient did have a bleeding scan performed while having red stool per rectum and the bleeding scan was negative.
