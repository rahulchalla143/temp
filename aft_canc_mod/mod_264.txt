Admission Date:  [**2188-7-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2188-7-14**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**] Chief Complaint: Diarrhea, hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 87 male with history of untreated colon cancer, PAF (not on anticoagulation), recent hospitalization for hypoxia, weakness and a UTI who presents with ongoing weakness and diarrhea.
He has not been having any fevers, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or bleeding.
His last hospitalization concluded that his weakness was due to deconditioning, and his shortness of breath was due to fluid overload.

New pancolitis with rectal involvement, with "accordion"-like accentuated haustration, a marked change since [**2188-3-5**], is highly suggestive of C. difficile colitis; given the history of previous episode, this likely represents the chronic "recurrent" form.
Infectious pancolitis (due to Campylobacter, CMV, parasitic or staphylococcal infection) is a less likely consideration.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Congestive heart failure, with multi-chamber cardiac enlargement and bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette is unchanged, with left pacemaker and two intracardiac leads.
Right pleural effusion is little changed, but there is still right basilar consolidative opacity.
Left basilar atelectasis is unchanged.
There is no left pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Little change in CHF, with slightly decreased right pleural fluid.
Unchanged right basilar atelectasis  [**7-5**]-CXR-Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions  [**7-9**]-CT abdomen/CT chest-1.
Multisegmental bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Atelectasis and aspiration/pneumonia of the lung bases bilaterally, with aspirated barium seen within the left lung base.
Fluid overload, with anasarca and moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
Colonic wall thickening, also involving the rectum.
Although some of the wall thickening may be attributable to volume overload, these findings are again compatible with a pancolitis such as pseudomembranous colitis, improved from [**2188-7-2**].
Area of stricturing and narrowing of the hepatic flexure, compatible with known colonic malignancy.
Perirectal abscess, measuring approximately 2.7 cm.
Brief Hospital Course: 87 male with history of colon cancer (untreated), atrial fibrillation, recent UTI, and positive C.dif toxin assay who presents with diarrhea, hypotension, and dehydration.
# Hypotension: On admission he was hypotensive to SBP 80's and thus admitted to the MICU, this was likely in the setting of profound dehydration from GI losses and poor PO intake.
He was fluid responsive thus far (a total of 5L of isotonic fluids).
Alternate etiologies, such as distributive or cardiogenic shock at this point were considered less likely.
# Diarrhea/C.dificile colitis.
He has had several positive C Diff toxin assays, and had one course of treatment after an [**Month (only) 547**] admission.
He was C diff toxin positive again and he was treated with IV flagyl and PO vancomycin as his diarrhea was severe and there was concern about the vancomycin working in the setting of a rapid transit time.
Initially he did not have abdominal pain, but began having lower abdominal pain and some rebound tenderness on exam.
A CT abdomen showed improvement in the colitis and a new perirectal abscess but no other abnormalities.
At the time of discharge he was tolerating a regular diet without difficulty and had improvement in his abdominal pain and diarrhea.
#Perirectal Abscess-Seen on CT, non-symptomatic but on exam he had tender fluctuance in the posterior rectum.
They recommended added cipro for gram negative coverage but given concern over exacerbating his c.diff which was already slow to improve, it was not added and conservatively management was pursued.
# Edema / CHF: He has bilateral pleural effusions, which have recently been tapped and found to be transudative.
He has a normal LVEF, but has had recent issues with fluid overload-likely [**2-23**] MR, TR.
# Hypoxia: Initially thought to be related to fluid overload / cardiac cause.
However he was suspected to have PEs in the setting of untreated malignancy (colon cancer-he refused surgery), he was on 4L O2 NC.
He had a CTA with bilateral subsegmental PEs, nonobstructive and an IVC filter was placed on [**7-10**] given inability to anticoagulate due to known colon malignancy.
# PE: Thought to be in setting of known malignancy.
# [**Month/Year (2) 2793**] isufficiency: He appears to be at his baseline - but his BUN was elevated on admission likely due to dehydration.
# Anemia: He had a recent transfusion - possibly due to underlying malignancy.
Hct was monitored, there was no need for transfusion as he is actually above recent baseline.

Tibial talar dislocation with comminuted distal tib fib fracture status post surgery [**2181**] Paget's disease of pelvis   Discharge Condition: stable, afebrile, good po intake, diarrhea improved.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with low blood pressure and were found to have C.difficle diarrhea.
You were transferred to a medical floor where your diarrhea improved, you were found to have a perirectal abscess which was not treated with medication due to your c.difficile infection.
You should follow up with outpatient surgery for further treatment.
Your oxygen level was low, you had a CT of your chest that showed pulmonary emboli (blood clots in your lungs) and an IVC filter was placed.
You should seek medical attention if you have worsening diarrhea, dizzyness, abdominal pain, chest pain ,shortness of breath or any other concerning symptoms.
