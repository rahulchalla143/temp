A CT scan revealed ampullary and uncinate process mass.
This combined with laboratory findings including markedly elevated alkaline phosphatase and CA19-9 were very concerning for pancreatic cancer.
A local CT scan revealed an ampullary and uncinate process mass.
On the operating table the patient went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate with associated hypotension and hypoxia.
Past Medical History: CABG [**2090**] CVA [**2088**] or [**2089**] pancreatic cancer prostate cancer s/p radiotherapy diabetes type 2 on insulin, neuropathy HTN - OSH echo of [**2102-7-2**] shows 60% LVEF, no focal wall motion abnormalities; mildly enlarged left atrium; mild MAC, trace MR, mild TR, normal appearing aortic valve.
Social History: married, supportive family, daughter-in-law is a nurse; occasional alcohol; former smoker, quit 35y ago; no herbals or illicits.
Family History: sister died of pancreatic cancer.
No early cardiovascular disease in either parent.
Physical Exam: On admission: HR 98 RR 14 WT 195 Gen: alert, pleasant elderly white man HEENT: perrl, mmm, no JVD, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly, no cervical lymphadenopathy Chest: CTAB, no wheezing; normal respiratory effort CV: regular s1, s2, no murmur Abd: obese, soft, +bs Extr: trace pitting edema to mid-shin, palpable radial and DP pulses bilaterally, no clubbing or cyanosis  ECG obtained showed sinus tachycardia without concerning ST segment deviations; tachycardia was shortly after patient transfered from wheelchair to examination table with some difficulty and resolved to HR of 90's within minutes.
Pertinent Results: [**8-10**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2102-6-26**] rapid atrial fibrillation has appeared.
[**8-12**] ABDOMEN CT:  There are new bilateral pleural effusions left greater than right.
Intra- and extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation is stable.
Hypodense ill-defined lesion in the pancreatic head, likely reflects the patient's known pancreatic mass.
Mild soft tissue stranding around it has somwhat increased.
Small lymph nodes in the porta hepatis are again demonstrated.
Trace free fluid is seen in the left paracolic gutter.
There are no intra- abdominal fluid collections.
There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
On [**2102-8-15**] he went for an ERCP to stent his biliary tree with a metal stent, but due to the gastric outlet obstruction a enteral stent was placed.
Post procedure, he was intubated in the ICU for suctioning of undigested food in the stomach and duodenum.
PTC placement could not be done secondary to inability to pass the wire.
AFter 4 attempts and inability to access L hepatic duct, patient then became hypotensive to SBP 60-80 and tachycardic to 130-150 with rapid A.fib and RVR without CP or SOB.
Patient remains a high risk for a whipple, the minimally invasive approaches have failed and Heme/Onc service has also raised the concern that the pancreatic cancer has further advanced.
A family meeting was called to discuss the poor prognosis of his cancer and the fact that he was not an operative candidate at all.
He was given 5mg oxycodone for pain which worked well, and compazine scheduled in the morning and prn throughout the day for nausea with god effect.
He went into a rapid irregular rhythm, most likely atrial fibrillation.
