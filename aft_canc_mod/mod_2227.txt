Admission Date:  [**2121-1-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-1-15**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation [**2121-1-10**]  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] year old man with a history of hep B cirrhosis and HCC s/p chemo embolization, RFA x 3, hx of LGIB from ?rectal varices and hemorrhoids, known esophageal varices, s/p post-pyloric feeding tube placement due to concern about aspiration and poor po intake, recently discharged from the liver-kidney service on [**2120-1-3**] for post-pyloric NG tube re-placement but he passed S/S so he went to rehab taking PO.
Today had a 'normal day' per his daughter until after lunch when he complained of dizziness.
There was no report of BRBPR or melena.
He complained of some abdominal pain and he had guaiac positive brown stool.
He was initially given 2L IVF without any change in his SBP so peripheral levophed was started and labs were checked.
CT Torso was then performed which showed ?multifocal pneumonia without other intrabdominal pathology.
Per ED resident, GI and liver consult were called but did not feel the patient's presentation was consistent with a variceal bleed so he is not on protonix or octreotide.
He has had multiple recent admissions at [**Hospital1 18**], from [**Date range (2) 35671**] with hypotension and worsening liver failure complicated by ascites and LE edema; also from [**2120-12-11**] to [**2120-12-18**] for BRBPR with no source of bleeding found and then from [**12-28**] to [**2121-1-1**] because his NG tube became dislodged and needed to be replaced.
He was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs for low HCT.
Lived with wife until recent illness; has been in and out of rehab since [**Month (only) 359**].
Physical Exam: On discharge:  VS:  T: 95.6/94 (min) HR: 77 (60s-100s) BP: 95/55 (90s-100s/50s-60s)  RR: 20 O2: 96% 2L NC GEN: Cachectic male sitting in bed, sleeping, NAD CV: RRR nl s1/s2, no m/r/g Lungs: CTA anteriorly Ext: 3+ pitting edema of the feet/ankles, up to the knees.

[**2121-1-11**]  BLOOD CULTURE ( MYCO/F LYTIC BOTTLE) NGTD BLOOD/FUNGAL CULTURE (Pending):  NGTD  STUDIES: [**1-10**] EKG: Probable atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2120-12-14**] atrial fibrillation is new.
[**1-10**] CXR: Diffuse interstitial edema is evident with significant worsening in the fluid balance relative to the prior exam.
Lung volumes are diminished especially on the left with marked elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
A right pleural effusion has developed.
There is likely left pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax is noted.
A right external jugular peripheral catheter is identified in the left neck.
Degenerative changes are seen throughout the thoracic spine and in bilateral shoulder joints.
Recommend repeat radiography after appropriate diuresis to assess for underlying infection.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mildly dilated thoracic aorta.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-11-8**], the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher and a left pleural effusion is now apparent.
Multifocal pneumonia.
Pulmonary edema and bilateral effusions.
Evaluation of the gallbladder is limited on this non-contrast-enhanced technique and in the setting of large volume ascites.
Recommend clinical correlation and abdominal ultrasound could be obtained if there is concern for acute cholecystitis.
Cirrhotic liver and large volume ascites.
Recommend advancement of orogastric tube.
We advise against any IV fluids given his edema as this could lead to discomfort or shortness of breath.
He was subsequently discharged to hospice care with PO morphine and ativan to be used as needed for discomfort.
Likely hypovolumia from blood loss/dehydration, but could be component of sepsis given his multifocal pneumonia and possible intraabdominal infection.
Echo was w/o focal findings.
# Intubation: Unclear reasons for intubation, could have been AMS and inability to protect airway.
No noted abnormality on respiratory status prior to intubation.
CT Torso appeared to have multifocal pneumonia, though findings may be chronic and related to patient's chronic aspiration.
He will be due to complete his last doses of IV flagyl for possible aspiration pneumonia on [**1-15**] per family request.
# Anemia: Chronic anemia, but lower than baseline on arrival (20 from 25).
GI saw the patient and it seemed unlikely that he had a new bleed as he had no sign of BRBPR or melena.
# Cirrhosis/Liver CA: LFTs are improved from baseline, but synthetic function was worse as evidenced by low albumin and platelets elevated INR.
He was seen by hepatology who felt that his worsened liver function may be related to his underlying infection in the setting of end stage disease.
This became an inactive issue after transfer to the floor as we stopped trending LFTs and treating liver disease with his CMO status.
# Thrombocytopenia: Likely due to liver failure, worsened from baseline.
Could be due to infection or decompensated liver disease.
As above, we stopped trending labs given goals of care  # Acute Renal Failure: Cr 3.7 from 1.4.
Likely pre-renal given hypotension and volume depletion.
