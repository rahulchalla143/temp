Patient has been undergoing active treatment for cervical cancer with Taxol/carboplatin with C4 on [**10-1**].
Ms. [**Known lastname **] has been having trouble with GI bleeding (in the setting of constipation and straining as per outpatient notes), and has been supported conservatively with blood transfusions.

CT abdomen/pelvis showed: "thickening of the rectum and sigmoid colon with extension to possibly the mid-descending colon raise suspicion for a proctocolitis due to an infectious or inflammatory process.
Heterogenous irregular cervical mass appears stable in size but there is more hypodense material endometrial canal suggesting either outlet obstruction by the mass or possibly involvement of the region by the mass.
Left upper lobe nodule has decreased in size."
Chronic eczematous process involving thighs, chronic hyperpigmented shins bilaterally, seen by dermatology in past.

Proctocolitis, which may be due to an infectious or inflammatory process.
Heterogenous irregular cervical mass appears relatively similar, compatible with known carcinoma.
Increased hypodense material in the endometrial canal with peripheral irregular enhancement is suggestive of increased endometrial fluid due to cervical obstruction by the mass with endometritis, but neoplastic involvement of the endometrium may also be present.
Heterogeneous hypodense area within the right lobe of the thyroid gland, consistent with the patient's known thyroid carcinoma.
Mild dilatation of the ureters without frank hydronephrosis, likely due to mass effect upon the distal ureters by the cervical tumor.
[**2161-10-6**] KUB FINDINGS:  There is retained contrast within the large bowel.
There is no dilated bowel.
There is no free air or pneumatosis.
IMPRESSION:  No gas abnormality.

Given recent chemotherapy, chemotherapy-induced colitis was high in our differential.
She was afebrile in the ICU and not passing stool, so an infectious etiology was felt to be less likely and Zosyn was discontinued on [**10-7**].
While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient passed small blood clots through her rectum but did not have frank hematochezia or melena.
UTI:  Patient with evidence of UTI on u/a on admission.
However, urine studies were felt to represent fecal contamination and her imaging was concerning for possible fistula.
Her outpatient oncologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] who felt colitis could be secondary to chemotherapy and chemotherapy was not given in house.
She denied symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.

A CT scan showed inflammation of your colon which is most likely due to your chemotherapy.
You also complained of tongue pain, which is also likely due to your chemotherapy.
In the future, please avoid over the counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), as they may cause worse bleeding in your GI tract.
