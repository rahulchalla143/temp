In ED, found to be afebrile but with bandemia (10.7 WBC, 18% bands), elevated lactate 7, acute renal failure with Cr 10 (baseline Cr 1.2), hyperkalemia (K 6.7), hyperuricemia (18) with any obvious EKG changes(baseline RBBB).
Of note, she had a CT torso on [**2146-11-7**] without prehydration and without holding metformin.
Treated for hyperkalemia and started on cefepime empirically.
She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and treated aggressively with IV fluids with improvement in renal failure and UOP (1600 cc out today off lasix).
Hyperkalemia resolved with with kayexalate, calcium gluconate, albuterol, D50/insulin.
Hyperuricemia resolved with rasburicase; tumor lysis syndrome thought unlikely.
Antibiotics broadened to Vanc, Cefepime, Flagyl initially for possible infection given bandemia with question of abdominal source given nonspecific abnormalities on CT abdomen in colon and ?necrosis in peritoneal masses but no infectious source has been found yet and pt remains afebrile without localizing symptoms; weaned off vanc today.
Has had persistent worsening thrombocytopenia (plt 37 today).
Nausea and diarrhea resolved and mental status improving per [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] team and family although with occasional disorientation to time, slurred speech, and mild memory deficits attributed to persistent uremia.
Review of systems: No fevers or chills.
No headache, neck stiffness.
No sob or cough.
No chest pain or palpatations.
No weakness or loss of sensation.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: ====================== Metastatic renal cell cancer: Originally presented with anemia and a large 16 x 11 cm mass was picked in her right kidney, a 5 x 3.5 cm chest lesion, and a L3 bony lesion.
On [**2146-2-17**], she had a laparoscopic nephrectomy for a clear cell carcinoma with predominantly grade 3 focal sarcomatoid features.
The chest lesion was biopsied on [**2146-2-21**], and was consistent with metastatic renal cell cancer.
The patient then received IL-2 with poor disease response.
<br> PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ==================== Anemia Hypertension Diabetes Hyperlipidemia Renal cell cancer s/p nephrectomy, lung bx for met, and L3 met with ongoing back pain C-section Open cholecystectomy   Social History: EtOH: Rarely, never abused Tobacco: Never used Retired high school English teacher.
Family History: Mother died of leukemia at age of 55 Paternal grandmother died of breast cancer at age of 55 Maternal aunt with breast ca no family history of blood clots  Physical Exam: VS: T 97.6, BP 154/92, HR 84, RR 15, O2sat 97% 2LNC, I [**2127**], O 1600 Gen: Obese female in NAD HEENT: NCAT, slightly dry mucous membranes NECK: Obese neck - did not appreciate JVD CV: RRR, +S1/S2 Lungs: Mild bibasilar crackles Abdomen: +BS, soft, obese, non-tender, 4-5cm abdominal wall mass in RLQ Extrem: no edema, +pneumoboots Skin: WWP, some patches of hypopigmentation Neuro: Awake, Alert, oriented to person, [**Hospital1 18**], year, month, but not day.
[**2146-11-9**] CXR: No acute intrathoracic process.
[**2146-11-9**] CT head: No acute intracranial process.
[**2146-11-9**] Renal U/S: Normal-appearing left kidney with no hydronephrosis.
Small-to-moderate amount of intra-abdominal ascites and a trace right pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents with N/V, ARF, hyperkalemia, lactic acidosis, bandemia.
Thought to have metabolic derangements initiated with Sutent leading to nausea/vomiting, decreased po intake which in conjunction with continuation of metformin lead to acute renal failure and lactic acidosis.
Renal was consulted and suspected prerenal etiology after sutent therapy with nausea and vomiting, with component of contrast exposure.
UA and culture done sig for proteinuria and Urine eos neg.
Patients [**Last Name (un) **] and HCTZ were held and not restarted on discharge; she was instructed to follow up with her PCP to have [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Cr check and determine when to restart these home medications.
Anion gap metabolic Acidosis: Lactic acid likely secondary to metformin, global hypoperfusion, and possibly necrotic peritoneal mass on CT scan.
Antibiotics were started for now for possible intraabdominal infection.
# Leukocytosis: Initial concern for infection of abdominal source given possible intraabdominal necrosis and she was started on vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl.
The patient remained afebrile with no localizing symptoms.
# Thromboyctopenia: DIC and TMA work-up negative.
Patient was maintained on ISS, however, had very little insulin requirement as her FSG were relatively well controlled 130-160.
Secondary Diagnosis: 1) Metastatic renal cell cancer 2) Anemia 3) Hypertension 4) Diabetes 5) Hyperlipidemia    Discharge Condition: Stable: T 97 BP 120/80 HR 61 O2 100/RA Platelets: 23 Creatine: 1.1   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with dehydration, electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities, called lactic acidoses.
You had poor kidney function, measured by an elevated Creatine, and so we also held your medication called Telmisartan - HCTZ.
You initially had a high white blood cell count that was treated with antibiotics.
During your hospitalization, you were found to have low platelets.
