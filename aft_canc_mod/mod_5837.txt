For his SOB, he had a CT torso, that was negative for PE but notable for air fluid level in esophagus, and had an NGT placed.
NGT placement attempt resulted in severe vomiting and thus deferred.

His pleural fluid and TBNA/EBBX of the mass all were positive for NSCLCA.
He had PET scan on [**6-24**] were he was found to have complete collapse of the right right lung and large pleural effusion s/p 2 elective thoracenteses and finally pleurex catheter placement for recurrent effusion [**Date range (1) 95587**], s/p 10 rounds of radiation, which ended [**7-8**].

He has been eating well and was able to tolerate regular PO despite severely distended stomach and esophagus on the CT. His SOB did resolve and he had normal O2 saturation.
He had no cough or fever.
The antibiotics (initiated in the ICU) were stopped as the suspicion for empyema complicating his pleural effusion was low.
IP decided against repeat thoracentesis but was they were willing to tap the fluid if he becomes febrile or develop respiratory symptoms.
His PET scan (one month ago) showed no intraperitoneal involvement but this radiologic finding may be related to metastatic disease (communicating from his right sided malignant pleural effusion, reactive ascites, or peritoneal carcinomatosis).
We held ACEI as he had hyperkalemia and low SBP.
