He was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after a hospitalization for exacerbation of his pulmonary GVHD.
He was noted to have increasing weakness over the past several days, as well as progressive respiratory distress and change in mental status.
On the day of admission, he had increased work of breathing and significant confusion.
His wife thought he may have been having visual hallucinations while in the outside hospital.
Initially, he was sent in an ambulance to [**Hospital1 18**], but due to his increasing respiratory distress, he was sent to [**Hospital1 498**] first.
Around the same time as intubation and treatment, he became hypotensive.
When he arrived at [**Hospital1 18**], he was hypotensive with SBPs 60-70, and was started on levophed, vasopressin and dopamine.
Acute promyelocytic leukemia - s/p ATRA and arsenic therapy,  allogeneic BMT, complicated by GVHD.
- bronchiolitis obliterans - FVC 2.31; FEV1 0.75; FEV1/FVC 32, with chronic cough - s/p corneal transplant L eye [**6-2**] and s/p cataract removal R eye [**10-3**] - pruritic rash - h/o diarrhea; gallbladder sludge - on ursodiol; lost about 130lbs after BMT 2. history of resistant stenotrophomonas growing from sputum 3. history of Pseudomonas pneumonia 4. chronic kidney disease - unclear etiology, thought to be [**Name (NI) 47605**]; recent baseline 0.9-1.0 5. hypertension 6. history of childhood asthma - hospitalized but not intubated 7. chronic C. difficile  Social History: Married with two children.
Not able to work currently secondary to his illness but previously he worked as an administrator for the VNA service in [**Hospital1 1559**],  a tax accountant, and an ICU nurse.

Gallbladder wall thickening and gallstones seen in the neck of the gallbladder consistent with cholecystitis.
Right pleural effusion.
KUB: No diagnostic abnormality.
Symmetric bilateral opacities in the mid lungs suggestive of moderate pulmonary edema, less likely hemorrhage.
These areas could also possibly represent an aspiration pneumonia.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment: 51yo man with acute promyelocytic leukemia s/p bone marrow transplant complicated by extensive graft vs. host disease including bronchiolitis obliterans, history of pseudomonas PNA, sputum growing resistant stenotrophomonas, and aspergillus colonization, who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and found to be hypotensive as well.
Respiratory failure - The most likely etiology of the respiratory failure was a pneumonia on the background of significant pulmonary disease (bronchiolitis obliterans with severely depressed FEV1 and FVC).
Given his severe immunocompromise, he was covered for infection by bacteria (including pseudomonas and resistant stenotrophomonas), fungus, or PCP.
He was thought to likely have ARDS secondary to sepsis, and the ARDS protocol for ventilator settings was attempted, but he did not tolerate these settings and became hypoxemic and acidemic.
Hypotension - On arrival to the ICU, the patient was found to be hypotensive.
The first BP read was 150/120, but then he was found to have a kinked blood pressure cuff.
Most likely, the hypotension was secondary to septic shock.
Pulmonary embolus was considered, but was less likely given his CXR.
This was thought to be secondary to lactic acidosis, nongap acidosis from normal saline boluses, and respiratory abnormalities.
His ventilator was set to attempt to correct the acidosis, but his blood pressure and hypoxia were confounding factors.
Acute promyelocytic leukemia with graft vs. host disease - He was continued on acyclovir, IV voriconazole, ursodiol, ophthalmic ointment.
Abdominal pain - He was found to have abdominal pain the morning after admission.
Despite maximal medical management in the MICU, the patient developed progressive organ dysfunction, in the context of advanced GVHD and progressive bronchiolitis obliterans lung disease.
