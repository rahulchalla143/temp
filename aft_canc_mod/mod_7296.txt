Admission Date:  [**2163-2-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2163-3-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2100-6-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6021**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and decreased PO intake  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: removal of peritoneal catheter   History of Present Illness: HPI: 62 y/o man with type I diabetes, well controlled for many years, crohn's disease, and recently diagnosed metastatic carcinoma of presumed GI origin who is admitted to the medical service after presenting to the emergency department when his Visiting nurse felt him not not look well.
He was found to have rapidly reacumulating ascites, peritoneal carcinomatosis, a long circumferential mass lesion in the descending colon, multiple liver metastasis, and bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Biopsy attempts have thus far been non-confirmatory which included biopsy of his colonic lesion, and cytology and cell block of ascitic fluid.
Further review of systems is notable for marked fatigue and malaise in associating with his pain and anti-nausea medications.

GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND CLUSTERS.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
CXR: Likely mild atelectasis at the right lung base and scarring in the upper right lung.
Multiple liver masses correspond with known colon cancer metastases.
Findings are equivocal for acute cholecystitis as there is mild gallbladder dilation, stones, and sludge but lack of son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name (NI) **] sign and no biliary dilation.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Abdominal distension likely secondary to large volume ascites.
Widespread hepatic metastases and omental caking/peritoneal carcinomatosis.
Decreased size of pleural effusions when compared to [**2163-2-3**], moderate on the right and small on the left.
[**Hospital Ward Name 517**] Course: A+P: 62 y/o man with metastatic carcinoma of unknown primary, though likely GI/colonic, admitted with dehydration, abd pain and fullness.
# Abdominal pain, peritonitis: Admitted for abdominal pain, N/V, decreased PO intake.
PTA pt was controlling his abdominal pain secondary to extensive abdominal tumor burden by draining approximately 1 L of ascites via his peritoneal port everyday.
Multiple etiologies were considered for the abdominal pain, including peritonitis secondary to peritoneal port and frequent access.
Acute cholecysitis / cholangitis was also considered because of rising LFTs on admission and an early US equivical for sig pesued ns of acute cholecysitis.
Intestinal obstruction was also possible given he difficulty with BMs, N/V, and known large colon mass.
On [**2-25**] Nr [**Known lastname **] had [**11-12**] pain and rebound and gaurding on exam and vomiting and further imaging was obtained.
On MRCP did not show any evidence of biliary tree obstruction.
CT abd with PO contrast showed extensive mets but no evidence of intestinal obstruction.
Mr [**Known lastname **] was treated with a Dilaudid PCA for pain control.
Nausea /vomitting controled with zofran, phenegram, zyprexa.
ID was consulted for advice on whether the GPC in blood, peritoneal fluid represents infection vs comtamination and if the PICC line needed to be removed.
# Dehydration: Dehydrated on admssion [**3-7**] Poor po intake, N/V, and ongoing third spacing from hypoalbuminemia.
Received blood 1/24 in hope of increasing the fluid keep intravasculary.
# Metastatic Carcinoma: no tissue diagnosis, but likely colonic.
Treatments should be considered palliative at this point given extent of disease and poor functional status.
The patient and family does not wish to persue a liver bx for tissue diagnosis.
The patients severe tumor burden and rapidly accumilating ascites is a major contributer to the abdominal pain.
Likely secondary to dehydration and intravascular hypovolemia.
# diabetes type I: continued on  lantus and ISS, allthough monitor for hypoglycemia in setting of imparied hepatic function.
Later on developed hypotension down to 90/50 which was fluid responsive.
He also had change of mental status and was only oriented x 1.
His tachypnea was thought to be due to aspiration PNA and his change of mental status to infection vs aspiration.
He developed worsening hypotension to the 80's unresponsive to IVF.
OMED Course: 62 M with metastatic carcinoma of likely GI/colonic, transferred to OMED for potential initiation of chemotherapy.
