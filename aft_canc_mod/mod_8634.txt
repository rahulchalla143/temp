Admission Date:  [**2142-8-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-8-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2080-7-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Dilantin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8790**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 99948**] is a 62 year-old man with esophageal cancer with mets to lung and brain, s/p several rounds of [**Last Name (LF) 3454**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] and whole chest xrt, who presents from [**Hospital **] hospital with one day of shortness of breath.
About one week ago, he was diagnosed by his oncologist with pneumonia after several days of productive cough and was started on levofloxacin and flagyl.
Two days prior to admission, he was admitted overnight to [**Hospital 47**] hospital for altered mental status [**3-19**] hypoglycemia.
Has a cough but no sputum production.
Denies fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or weakness.
He was notably SOB but speaking in full sentences.
CXR showed a RLL opacity.
He was given vanco and cefepime for empiric pna coverage.
On the floor, he reports that his breathing feels much better.
He has no other complaints currently except that he is hungry and thirsty.
Past Medical History: Esophageal cancer History of PE in [**2142**] (on chronic lovenox) HTN DMII, likely secondary to steroids History of erythema multiforme in [**2142**] (likely [**3-19**] keppra +/- dilantin) History of [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) **] in late '70s (unclear cause) S/p appendectomy '[**11**] .
Onc History: The patient originally presented in [**2140-8-14**] with headache, confusion, disorientation and visual changes.
An outside hospital brain MRI showed a large right occipital hemorrhagic mass on [**2140-9-18**].
Torso CT showed multiple primary nodules, esophageal wall thickening and right renal mass.
Craniotomy on [**2140-9-23**] revealed adenocarcinoma that was CK20 and CDX positive for adenocarcinoma that was eventually evaluated and felt consistent with esophageal origin.
He was then seen at the [**Hospital 4601**] Cancer Center for treatment of his esophageal carcinoma.
He was then discontinued off his regimen because of increased creatinine.
He then had some evidence of progression of disease and then was changed to Taxol and carboplatin.
On [**2141-11-29**] torso CT showed continued evidence of progression of disease.
He had received two cycles of this, but had increasing dysphagia.
In [**2142-1-15**], there were a couple of new lesions that were concerning for new metastasis.
A torso CT earlier in [**Month (only) 116**] had shown no disease below the diaphragm, with only small pulmonary nodules that were slowly growing.
At this point, the plan was conservative management of the patient with serial imaging.
Retired, formerly worked as drug and alcohol counselor at [**Hospital 882**] Hospital (retired after being diagnosed with esophageal ca).
No history of EtOH or tobacco use  Family History: noncontributory  Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 99.9, BP: 116/73, P: 116, R: 31, O2: 93% on high flow mask General: Alert, oriented, middle-aged man in no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, bronchial breath sounds at the left base, no wheezes or rales CV: tachycardic, regular, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema  Pertinent Results: Imaging: .
Total collapse of the left lower lobe.
Patchy opacity in the medial right lower lobe.
This may represent aspiration and/or pneumonia.
Innumerable pulmonary nodules presumably secondary to metastatic disease.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Progressive bilateral hilar adenopathy, producing bronchial obstruction, right upper lobe, bronchus intermedius and right lower lobe probably contributing to atelectasis.
Local lymphangitic tumor extension to the right lower lobe and confluent metastases producing atelectasis in the left upper lobe are new and there has been progression of mediastinal adenopathy particularly at the thoracic inlet.
Generalized increase in size of the long lower esophageal tumor is not accompanied by obvious invasion of local mediastinal organs, despite new small pericardial effusion.
Small layering pleural effusions, probably due to cardiac decompensation producing minimal edema, progressed on subsequent chest radiograph of [**8-22**].
Left renal or juxtarenal mass increased since [**2140**].
#  Shortness of breath/Hypoxia:  Upon admission, the patient was in acute hypoxic distress requiring almost 100% FiO2 high flow oxygen.
His acute decompensation was most likely secondary to pneumonia compounded by metastatic esophageal disease.
PE was thought to be less likely despite the positive history of PE and malignancy, especially as the patient was on prophylaxtic lovenox at home.
A TTE with bubble study showed no evidence of intracardiac shunt.
A thoracic CT w/o contrast confirmed diffuse metastatic disease compressing the bronchioles and the patient's respiratory compromise was largely irreversible.
#  Fever/Leukocytosis:  The patient's initial sepsis was attributed to bacterial pneumonia based on CXR and symptoms.
#  Esophageal cancer with CNS and lung metastases:  The patient's primary oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 99949**] was notified of the patient's admission and progress throughout his stay in the ICU.
The patient was continued on chronic dose of prednisone as per neurooncologist due to symptoms of mild adrenal insuffieciency.
When it was determined that metastatic disease contributed to respiratory decline, primary oncologist was involved with discussion with patient regarding his poor prognosis.
#  Diabetes Type II: stable with humalog sliding scale .
# Prophylaxis: The patient rmained on outpatient lovenox for DVT prophylaxis and PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
[**Hospital 2035**] Hospital Course: CT scan on admission demonstrated significant progression of metastatic melanoma.
Patient started on morphine SL to improve dyspnea and cough in additon to dexamethasone, albuterol NABs, lasix and cough syrup.
Patient was discharged on 3 more days of IV ABx Keftaz to treat bactermia for 14 day course however hospice was not able to provide IV therapy therefore ABx was discontinued.
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Morphine Concentrate 20 mg/mL Solution Sig: 5-20 mg PO q10minutes as needed for shortness of breath.

Alum-Mag Hydroxide-Simeth 200-200-20 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for abdominal discomfort.
