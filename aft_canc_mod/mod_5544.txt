The patient lives across the street from [**Hospital1 18**] in the [**Hospital1 1426**] Apartments with her husband.
She states she was feeling well until the evening prior to presentation, when she began to feel warm and have shaking chills.
She denies overt sick contacts, although she thinks her husband has been developing a head cold over the last several days.
The only other symptoms she has is pain near the site of her Hickman, about 2 cm below the insertion site.
She denied any other associated symptoms, including chest pain, shorteness of breath, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, syncope, extremity pain, dysphagia/odynophagia, dysuria, or new rash.
She was first seen for a pancytopenia in [**9-/2149**] and ultimately diagnosed with biphenotypic leukemia in [**11-10**], now s/p allogenic stem cell transplant [**4-29**], now day 84 (on [**7-22**]).
Her posttransplant course was complicated by severe mucositis requiring TPN and PCA narcotics as well as coag-negative staph bacteremia, which was treated with vancomycin from [**2150-5-9**] through [**2150-5-23**].
She has unfortunately required four admissions post-transplant due to nausea, vomiting, and increased creatinine.
Another admission was on [**2150-6-14**] for some increased diarrhea overnight and vomiting.
Her last admission was on [**7-3**] for increasing weakness and numbness of her legs.
Her Tacrolimus and Dapsone were held on admission due to concern for contribution to neuropathy.
Her initial LP was negative for evidence of leukemic involvement or bacterial infection; [**Date Range 18617**] serologies were negative for EBV, HHV6, HSV, CMV, and [**Male First Name (un) 2326**] virus.
Pt was evaluated by neurology, who thought that her neuropathy could be due to the B12 but unlikely given rapid presentation.
She had an MRI spine that was negative for cord compromise.
She received one dose of IVIg on [**6-28**], without incident.
declined as she does not feel it would change managment of her neurolgoical symptoms.
is in no acute distress an afebrile.
[**Month/Year (2) 24895**], has chronic complaints of "no proprioception" in her lower extremities, chronic LE swelling, and pain near her Hickman.
No other complaings.
Past Medical History: Mrs. [**Known lastname 8271**] is a 62-year-old woman who was noted to have a pancytopenia [**9-/2149**] and ultimately diagnosed with biphenotypic leukemia.
Her bone marrow continued to show up blasts, and she was treated by a cycle of clofarabine and ARC, resulting in an empty marrow without evidence of leukemia.
This cycle of treatment was complicated by high-grade VRE bacteremia and coag-negative staph bacteremia in the setting of neutropenia.
She was noted to have septic thrombophlebitis and required intubation and ICU support.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 8271**] also developed ATN and ultimately anuric renal failure, became dialysis dependent, but after two to three weeks, began making urine and currently has a normal creatinine without the need for dialysis.
Bone marrow biopsy done on [**2150-4-2**] showed a hypercellular marrow for age with erythroid hyperplasia.
There were no morphologic features of residual or recurrent leukemia seen.
Ms. [**Known lastname 13290**] posttransplant course was complicated by severe mucositis requiring TPN and PCA narcotics as well as coag-negative staph bacteremia, which was treated with vancomycin from [**2150-5-9**] through [**2150-5-23**].
She has unfortunately required four admissions post-transplant due to nausea, vomiting, and increased creatinine.
Her most recent admission was on [**2150-6-14**] for some increased diarrhea overnight and vomiting.

came in from [**Hospital 1426**] medical apartments with a white count of 1.3  and fevers of 101.5, rigors, general malaise and fatigue.
She was started on empirical Vancomycin, cefepime, and voriconazole for neutropenic fevers.
Chest Xrays in the ER were negative for infiltrates or effusions.
CT chest performed as pt was c/o of pain near her insertion site of her Hickman Cath.
CT negative for pathology  Prior to the result of blood cultures, the pt was switched from vancomycin to daptomycin on [**7-23**] for empiric VRE coverage given pt's history of severe VRE sepsis in the past.
ID was consulted and recommended dc'ing daptomycin an and restarting vancomycin for coag negative staph, as well as starting ganciclovir for potential benefits against EBV.
Her cyclosporin doses were decreased to keep a therepeutic range of 150-200, and her prednisone was tapered down to 10 mg a day as she had no current evidence of GVHD.
It was felt fevers were most likely coming from either coag negative staph infection or EBV.
was going into acute renal failure (ATN evidenced by granular casts in urine sediment), liver failure (transaminitis and bilirubin of >3).
At this point, her ganciclovir was dc'd due to renal toxicity, and her Vancomycin and ceftriaxone were replaced by daptomycin and meropenem for coverage of possible sepsis of unknown etiology.
continued to spike fevers, and by [**7-29**] triggered for hypotension of SBP <80.
In the ICU the patient remained febrile, hypotensive requiring multiple pressors, and she was intubated requiring a mechanical ventilator.
On [**2150-7-31**], the patient developed profound abdominal distention, severe acidosis, had peak airway pressures of 70, complete anuria and hypotension despite multiple vaso-active agents.
There was concern for bowel and mesenteric ischemia and abdominal compartment syndrome.
She became bradycardic.
Ventricular fibrillation followed.
# Renal Failure:  Ms. [**Known lastname 8271**] has a history of recurrent ARF on previous admissions, requiring hemodialysis for 2-3 weeks after VRE/Coag neg staph sepsis in early [**Month (only) **].
Over the course of 1 week, it incerased to 2.3, with acute changes starting on [**7-27**].
Pt noted cloudy dark urine changes, and her UA was positive for blood, significant granular casts, and protein.
[**Name (NI) 24895**], pt was mildly anemic, thrombocytopenic, and had mild alterations in mental status s/o TTP/HUS/Microangiopathic process.
The patient became anuric in the ICU before expiring.
Pt has history of mild transaminitis in the past and was deemed to be due to NASH.
RUQ US and MRCP were both negative for obstruction or evidence of intrahepatic/hepatic vasculature process.
has had a history of ascending neuropathy since 6 months prior to presentation with the initiation of her chemotherapy.
has been getting around with the use of a wheel chair because of this.
mentioned visual color changes (reds looked bright yellow) and had a drifting alertness near the end of her first week in the hospital.
Neurology was consulted, and mentioned her neuropathy is unchanged or slighlty improved, and that her visual changes were most likely due to voriconazole toxicity in the setting of renal failure.
of leukemia s/p allogenic SCT: Pt was day +84 on admission.
She continued to be on cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, as well as prednisone and budenoside for potential GVHD due to symptoms of nausea several weeks prior to presentation.
# Broken lateral malleolus:  Pt has history of neuropathy per above.
She had intense pain after.
Xray was performed which showed tendinous strain and lateral maleolus avulsion fracture.
