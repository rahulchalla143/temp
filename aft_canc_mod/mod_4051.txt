Thickened transverse colon and descending colon with mild pericolonic fat stranding.
Potential etiologies include ischemia vs. infection.
Several tiny low attenuation liver lesions, too small to characterize on this study.
Left adrenal mass.
Low attenuation right kidney lesion, likely representing a simple cyst.
Small hiatal hernia.
[**2192-10-25**] Abdominal Xray: no evidence of obstruction  [**2192-10-26**] Abdominal CT: 1.
Thickened transverse colon and descending colon, with pericolonic fat stranding.
There has been some interval improvement with decreased involvement of the transverse colon.
The appearance of the distal tranverse and proximal descending colon has not significantly changed.
Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis, which is stable in the interval  [**2192-11-6**] Abdominal CT: 1.
No evidence of extravasation of contrast from the bladder.
No definite extravasation from the urethra, although this evaluation is limited.
Moderate amount of free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis, but no focal walled-off collections.
The superior most collection underlies skin staples at approximately the L3 level.
Stricture of colon, with submucosal fibrosis, transmural necrosis, and organizing pericolic fat necrosis.
The features are most consistent with chronic ischemic colitis.
Small adenoma of ascending colon.
Umbilical hernia:  Fragment of fibroadipose tissue.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 74 year old female with peripheral vascular disease and polycythemia who was admitted with bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and an elevated white count on [**2192-10-22**].
The presumed diagnosis was ischemic colitis.
A CT on admission did not show SMA or [**Female First Name (un) 899**] occlusion but demonstrated thickened transverse and descending colon.
The patient was managed conservatively during her initial 2 weeks of hospitalization, with NPO/bowel rest, TPN initiatied for nutrition, and IV antibiotics (levoquin and flagyl) for treatment.
However, after approximately 10 days she continued to have abdominal pain and diarrhea which then worsened and her white cell count and she had a slight metabolic acidosis.
Ex-lap revealed a markedly dilated colon, from the cecal area to the splenic flexure.
Pathology of the specimen revealed stricture consistent with chronic ischemic colitis.
She received volume resuscitation with LR and albumin and bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia.
She had some hematuria with a normal renal ultrasound; it was determined that this was secondary to Foley catheter trauma and she was started on continuous bladder irrigation with resolution of her hematuria.
From an infectious diseases standpoint, the patient remained afebrile post-operatively but her white count trended upwards starting on post-operative day 10.
A full infectious workup was negative for stool pathogens but revealed VRE in her urine and MRSA in her sputum (though chest xray was not indicative of pneumonia).
CT scan demonstrated drainable fluid collections under her laparotomy incision and the incision was paritally opened at the bedside with drainage of fluid positive for MRSA.
The patient was started on Linezolid/Zosyn/Flagyl for coverage of her MRSA/VRE and empiric C. diff and pneumonia coverage.
In summary, this is a 74 year old female with ischemic colitis who underwent a subtotal colectomy with ileosigmoid colostomy who had urine and wound infections post-operatively.
She will require rehab placement for continued treatment of her infections and for assistance with returnt to baseline functional state.
