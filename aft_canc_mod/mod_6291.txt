Admission Date:  [**2138-9-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-10-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-11-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Oxycodone  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: thoracentesis (left and right) dialysis catheter (right IJ) CVVH dialysis chest tube (left) pigtail catheter right HD catheter removed [**10-15**] left subclavian removed [**10-15**] left IJ placed on [**10-15**] right IJ placed on [**10-27**] Picc line (left) Art line x 2 (right and left radials)   History of Present Illness: The pt is a 74-yo woman w/ hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and a recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer vs. lymphoma, who presented to the ED for evaluation today for acute renal failure.
The pt notes that she has been feeling increasingly SOB and weak over the last couple days, with an episode of dizziness / lightheadedness on the day prior to admission.
The pt has not been eating well over the last few days and had an episode of nausea / vomiting on the day prior to admission as well.
She had an abdominal ultrasound done on the day prior to admission for evaluation for paracentesis, and labs drawn that day showed worsening renal function, so she was called to come in to the ED today for evaluation.
CXR revealed a large left pleural effusion and ECG was low voltage.
Pulsus was 10, so a bedside TTE was done to eval for tamponade, which revealed a mild pericardial effusion without tamponade physiology.
She is being admitted to the MICU for evaluation and treatment of her hyperkalemia and acute renal failure.
The pt has a recent dx of ovarian cancer vs. lymphoma.
Approx 6 weeks PTA, the pt started to feel tired and developed swollen legs and a distended abdomen.
Evaluation revealed a mass on her right ovary that was to be removed, but CT scan prior to surgery also showed enlarged LNs, so the surgery was held off until a biopsy specimen could be taken of the lymph nodes.
There is some thought that the cancer may be a lymphoma rather than primary ovarian.

Course has been complicated by hypotension requiring pressors (levophed).
PMH includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
Last 2-3 days prior to leaving the MICU for the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she tolerated several hours without pressors; however, she received albumin or blood during these periods.
- [**Name (NI) 15305**] pt has a leukocytosis but has been afebrile.
Will monitor PICC line for signs of infection.
Increased dose of Synthroid and transitioned to IV but endocrinology that it is unlikely for hypothyroidism to be the cause.
- Cardiogenic-  Originally, was concerned for tamponade.
Although they have been suboptimal studies, multiple echoes have only showed effusions without echocardiographic evidence of tamponade with one exception.
Most recent echo on [**9-24**] again did not show evidence of tamponade, just small effusion.
Throughout her course in the MICU, have considered V/Q scan to r/o PE as a possible cause of hypotension however, given her echo findings, the pretest possibility remains equivocal.
- At time of transfer, the etiology of her hypotension remains elusive.
Without an adequate explanation, team has hypothesized that this may be a possible paraneoplastic syndrome.
# Bilat pleural effusions, cytology from left c/w malignancy.
Final cytology from right effusion still pending at time of transfer but pH, cell counts, gluc, prot consistent with left effusion and anticipate that it will also be malignant.
A repeat CT on [**9-22**] showed increased right sided effusion which was tapped on [**9-24**].
Acute renal failure ??????
Persistent volume overload and anasarca.
Hyperkalemia resolved quickly (see below).
Acutely on [**9-24**], she developed hyponatremia and hyperglycemia.
Unclear etiology but hyponatremia may be related to the ultrafiltrate bath having a Na concentration of 130.
Also, hyperglycemia seems to have occurred acutely.
No prior episodes of hyperglycemia during this admission.
Could be related to diffuse extravascular volume.
Initially, pt was hyperphosphatemic but on the day of transfer pt required repletion of phos.
Used Na-Phos for added sodium benefit.
# Metastatic ovarian cancer: cardiopulmonary status has been too tenuous for treatment during this admission.
Obtained tumor markers which revealed borderline high CA-125 and elevated CA27,29, but were overall non-specific.
Also, on allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome.
Hypothyroidism ??????
Was diagnosed with hypothyroidism approx 2 weeks prior to admission and had been started on a low dose of Synthroid.
Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.
Hyperkalemia, resolved: Was most likely due to worsening renal function, esp in setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and ACE-I.
Hyperlipidemia - Taking home statin dose.
Hypotension and Sepitc shock: the patient had been on-and-off pressors for the length of her ICU admissions.
However, during her ICU stay she began to deteriorate and her course was complicated by C. diff colitis tx with IV flagyl po/pr vancomycin.
Additionally, she developed a VAP w/ pseudomonas and was treated with ceftazidime.
Due to patient's labile blood pressure and tendency towards hypotension she was started CVVH.
She was subsequently tried on HD, given albumin and fluids for volume, and eventually maintained a low but steady blood pressure with concominant tachycardia.
She was no longer a candidate for CVVH due to her hypotension and worsening clincal picture.
Her creatinine continued to trend upwards and she had multiple electrolyte abnormalities including continued hyperkalemia that was refractory to treatment.
# Tachycardia: the patient had several episodes of tachycardia to 130-140s, with transition to NSVT.
#Pleural effusions: Patient had chest tube placement with initial high output which eventually tapered off.
This was thought likely due to her malignancy.
She continued to have signifcant pleural effusions.
# Metastatic ovarian cancer: Patient was followed by the OMED service.
Her WBC and fever curve were monitored.
