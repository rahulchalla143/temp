History of Present Illness: The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of colon cancer, as well as testicular cancer, who presents with progressive signs of dizziness, visual difficulties, unsteady gait for approximately 12 months.
He was worked up including an MRI scan that showed a brainstem lesion.
He was examined by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 66170**] whose physical exam reportedly showed bilateral facial numbness and swaying, and a MRI of the head was preformed.
The patient was thus considered to have a brainstem glioma and started on Decadron.
In the office, the patient complains about dizziness, blurred vision, double vision, occasional headaches, and unsteady gait.
Has a history of arthritis in the lower back, otherwise, he reports that the numbness in his hands has disappeared since starting the Decadron.
He was told that he had a left lazy eye at baseline, but the patient is not quite sure about the symptoms.
He denies otherwise any extreme fatigue, weight loss or other symptoms.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Sigmoid colon cancer [**2125**] Testicular cancer s/p Left orchiectomy and was found to be a germ cell tumor T1, N0.was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy no radiation.
Hemorrhoids Recurrent bouts of thrush   Social History: He is a high school graduate.
Family History: His mother died at 63 of a heart attack.
There are two brothers, one brother at 47 who has hypertension and two daughters that are in good health.
Physical Exam: GENERAL: He is alert, pleasant, middle-aged man in no acute distress.
HEENT: The patient did have a head tilt to the left.
No murmurs, gallops or rubs.
EXTREMITIES: No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Eye movements are full and we cannot detect a clear deficit of a particular muscle, at current, the patient has no diplopia.
He has non-exhaustible end gaze nystagmus with rotatory component.
The patient does not have any memory problems, blackouts, nausea, concentration, or speech problems, as well as hearing problems.
I found no evidence of any weakness in his hands.
Cerebellar: He had bilateral intention tremor in the hands as well as finger tapping and rapid alternating movements were fine.
Pathology [**2132-12-31**]: MIDDLE CEREBELLAR PEDUNCLE/PONS STEREOTACTIC BRAIN BIOPSY (including intraoperative smear): DIFFUSELY INFILTRATING FIBRILLARY ASTROCYTOMA.
Brief Hospital Course: 56 M with PMH sigmoid and testicular ca in [**2125**], HTN, COPD, admitted for new diagnosis pontine glioma s/p posterior fossa decompression and necrotizing pna.
Patient taken to OR on [**12-31**] for brainstem lesion biopsy under general anesthesia.
On postop day one patient demonstrated difficulty of swallowing which he failed his speech and swallow evaluation.
On [**2133-1-2**] patient taken back to OR for a suboccipital chiari decompression.
Patient tranferred to neuro ICU for hemodymanic and neurologic monitoring.
Due to postoperaive respiratory secretion extubated on [**2133-1-4**] after bronchcospy.
Brain stem biopsy pathology result is significant for infiltrative astrocytoma.
Radiation oncology decided not to perform radiation mapping and to hold off for another several weeks before planning to start XRT, since patient has a slow growing glioma, and XRT could exacerbate pna.
His speech continued to become more articulate and clear, and his mental status continued to become more clear.
The patient stated that his dizziness has improved.
# Necrotizing pneumonia: Patient has a known pulmonary process that been followed in [**Hospital 669**] [**Hospital **] hospital in MA.
In house repeat CT of the chest significant for left lower lobe, consolidative opacity, with central area of necrosis, an air-fluid level, and low-attenuation material.
Additionally, there are several areas within the right and left lungs peripherally, with patchy opacity and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities, concerning for multifocal opacity.
There is also a wedge-shaped opacity in the right lower lung zone, some of which may represent atelectasis.There is a 3.3 x 2.6 cm nodule with multiple foci of calcification within the left lower lobe.
In the mean time [**Name (NI) 653**] with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] at the [**Hospital **] hospital regarding tranfering him over to VA regarding his known pulmonary process, and colon carcinoma for further work up which he was agreed with the transfer.
BAL culture grew out Stenotrophomonas maltophila and Klebsiella sensitive to almost all abx tested.
Dermotalogy recommended excision of the lesion to rule out melanoma once acute issues resolved with Derm Surgery ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2977**]).
# HTN: Controlled.
Medications on Admission: The patient is a 56 y/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4746**] with a PMH significant for sigmoid and testicular cancer in '[**25**], HTN, and COPD who was admitted to the neurosurgery service on [**2132-12-31**] with a new diagnosis of a pontine mass after 1yr of progressive dizziness and ataxia.
He underwent a stereotactic bx on [**12-31**] showing a low grade glioma and received a palliative posterior fossa expansion on [**1-2**].
Routine pre-op CXR revealed multiple opacities and a 3x3 cm well demarcated cavitary lesion with an air/fluid level in left posterior lung.
On [**1-3**], a chest CT was done which showed a multifocal pneumonic process with LLL necrotizing PNA.
He underwent a bronch on [**1-4**] with BAL revealing MSSA and stenotrophamonas and was started on Levofloxacin (now d10/14), Vanco (since d/c), and Clinda (d10/42) at this time.
Over the past 2d, he has been afebrile and his secretions have cleared appreciably.
From an oncologic standpoint, his pontine lesion is not amenable to resection and the plan is to initiate palliative radiation therapy.
Colon cancer 2. testicular cancer 3.
Some improvement in the consolidation in the left lower lobe, although the large 4-cm cavitary lesion with an air-fluid level persists, consistent with slight overall improvement in necrotizing pneumonia.
New small cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe, possibly related to aspiration.
Of note, the patient has a small hiatal hernia.
Improvement in some of the ground-glass opacities in the right middle and upper lobes, with persistent 4-mm lung nodule.
Similar slightly prominent right hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
CT Head ([**2133-1-9**]): No definite change in the mass effect associated with the brainstem glioma.

CXR [**2133-1-10**]: No interval change.
Persistent opacity at the left base.
There is a 3.6-cm parenchymal opacity within the left base as well which is also unchanged.
There is no evidence for overt pulmonary edema.
Found to have a pontine glioma now s/p posterior fossa decompression complicated by necrotizing PNA and multiple episodes of hypoxia requiring MICU level care.
Called out to medicine service for further management of his infection and pulmonary status.
Bactrim was started on [**1-8**] (x 2 weeks): BAL + for stenotrophamonas.
