Admission Date:  [**2145-3-1**]     Discharge Date:  [**2145-3-3**]   Service:  ACOVE-IM  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and cough.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77 year old woman with end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease complaining of shortness of breath and cough beginning [**2-24**].
She reports becoming very dyspneic after walking just ten feet.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease dependent upon oral     steroids; [**12/2144**] spirometry reveals FVC 71%, FEV1 34%,     and FEV1/FVC of 48%.
Right hip fracture in the past.
Colonic polyps believed to be causing a chronic lower     gastrointestinal bleed, but surgery has been deferred     owing to her poor baseline nutritional and pulmonary     status.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Had worked several jobs as a writer earlier in life and in real estate.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Has one bowel movement q. a.m.  Reports that her Crohn's Disease has not caused her problems.
Complains of easy bruising secondary to taking Prednisone and states that she has many bruises on her calves because of collisions with her dog.
Chest:  Prolonged expiratory phase with crackles at baseline bilaterally, using accessory muscles prominently.
Extremities with no edema.
Urinalysis negative for urinary tract infection.
IMAGING STUDIES:  Chest x-ray with no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
There is a rounded density at the right base which likely relates to diaphragm.
IMPRESSION & PLAN:  77 year old woman with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presenting with cough and exacerbation of shortness of breath for a few days.
Differential diagnoses include:  Cardiac cause of acute exacerbation (e.g., congestive heart failure), or infectious versus non-infectious pulmonary cause.
Most likely, she has a upper respiratory infection representing either a viral upper respiratory infection or an atypical pneumonia.
She was comfortable at this setting, although she continued to complain of severe dyspnea which she stated was her baseline.
She also received Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizer treatments although she did not have evidence of bronchospasm on examination.
On further discussion, the patient states that her baseline exercise tolerance is so poor that she is unable to perform basic functions such as getting from her bed at home to her bathroom without becoming extremely dyspneic.
Hematologic:  She has a persistently elevated white blood cell count often to the low 20s, in the past.
Most likely, this represents and effects both of the steroids that she is taking and of a possible myelodysplastic syndrome.
Given that myelodysplastic syndrome is treated only symptomatically with blood transfusions, no further work-up is necessary at this time.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Viral pneumonia or atypical pneumonia or viral upper     respiratory infection.
