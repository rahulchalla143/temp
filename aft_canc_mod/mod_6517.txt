Pertinent Results: MRI brain [**2166-1-16**]: There is a large heterogeneously rim-enhancing mass in the right frontal lobe measuring 2.4 x 2.7 cm with enhancement also extending to the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] subependymally and to the corpus callosum.
An additional focus of enhancing abnormality is seen in the right temporal lobe.There is edema surrounding the right frontal lobe lesion with midline shift.
There are blood products in the operative bed, which limit evaluation for residual neoplasm.
However, there does appear to be residual enhancing abnormality in the right frontal lobe and along the inferior margin of the operative cavity extending into the corpus callosum and the caudate head.
There is also nodular enhancement along the anterior and posterior margins of the operative cavity superiorly.
There is a focus of restricted diffusion in the right frontal lobe along the inferior lateral margin of the cavity.
This may represent cytotoxic edema from surgery.
There is a small right hemispheric extra-axial postoperative collection.
Right parafalcine extra-axial collection is also noted.There is slight improvement in the midline shift to the left.
On [**1-18**] her MRI showed some residual tumor but decreased midline shift.
