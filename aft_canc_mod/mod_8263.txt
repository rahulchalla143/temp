Her symptoms at that time consisted of cough, SOB and occasional chest pain.
She completed a course of antibiotics but her symptoms have persisted and even worsened since that time.
She was experiencing worsening SOB as well as worsening lethargy, DOE, and chest discomfort.
She also reports that she has had a decreased appetite since [**Month (only) 404**] and has lost approximately 20 pounds.
On f/u chest xray with her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] large [**Name Initial (PRE) **] sided mass was discovered and she was subsequently sent for CTChest which confirmed presence of a large R atrial mass (thought to be within the atrium).
Differential diagnosis at this juncture includes hematoma, lymphoma, aneurysm, psuedoaneurysm, thymoma or NSGCT.
Thoracic surgery is consulted for consideration of biopsy for tissue diagnosis.

Large 9.8 x 10.0 cm mass causing compression of the right atrium and superior vena cava which is either arising from the pericardium or the right atrium which will be further evaluated on planned echocardiogram performed today.
The mass demonstrates heterogeneous signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging and heterogeneous enhancement post-contrast.
8-mm nodule in the left adrenal gland which is indeterminate given limitations of slice thickness and its small size.
If CT cannot be performed MR may be repeated with dedicated adrenal protocol.
Likely benign osseous hemangiomas noted within the lumbar spine.
[**2157-5-11**]: Bilateral lower extremity doppler:  No evidence of DVT.
A very large (7 x 10 cm) mass is seen in or adjacent to the right atrium which compresses/distorts the right atrium and tricuspid valve apparatus.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: A very large (7 x 10 cm) mass is seen in or directly adjacent to the right atrium which compresses/distorts the right atrium and tricuspid valve apparatus.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Very small pericardial effusion.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Preserved left ventricular systolic function.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was transfer from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital on [**2157-5-11**] for a right 7 x 10 cm paracardial mass that has rapidly grown over the past 2 months.
Upon arrival abdominal MRI, bilateral lower extremity duplex and echocardiogram (see above report) were obtained.
