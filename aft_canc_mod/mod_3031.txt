Admission Date: [**2113-6-16**]        Discharge Date: [**2113-7-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2038-5-30**]        Sex:  F  Service:  [**Last Name (un) 7081**]   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74 year old woman with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and asthma, who developed a vague cough and some right-sided chest discomfort about a year ago.
A chest CT showed a 4.6 x 4.4 cm mass in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe.
It was noted to abut the esophagus and invade the right paraspinal area.
There were 1 cm pretracheal nodes.
On [**2112-12-16**], the patient underwent bronchoscopy that demonstrated chronic inflammation with focal epithelial atypia.
On [**2113-2-8**], the patient underwent a PET scan that showed increased activity in the right upper lobe mass, the right hilar lymph node, and some moderately increased uptake in the pretracheal lymph nodes.
On [**2113-3-10**], the patient underwent a thorascopic evaluation with biopsy of the right hilar lymph node.
Pathology demonstrated non-small cell lung cancer with squamous differentiation.
At this point, she had experienced a 7 pound weight loss over 3 months and her appetite has been a little lower than usual.
She denied shortness of breath but did have some dyspnea on exertion after walking up one flight of stairs.
A restaging set of PET and CT scans showed significant decrease in activity within the right upper lobe mass and hilar lymph nodes as well as significant reduction in the overall size on CT scan.
There was, however, an area of bony erosion where the tumor abuts the vertebral column.
Extremities:  No clubbing or edema.
Skin:  No lesions.
Over the following three days, the patient experienced some post-op oliguria which resolved with several fluid boluses.
Post-op day four was the first day the patient experienced a negative fluid balance.
On post-op day six, the patient was found to be in sinus tachycardia with wheezing and a chest x-ray showed collapse of the right upper and right lower lobes.
On post-op day seven, the patient was noted to have methemoglobinemia, presumably secondary to benzocaine use.
On post-op day eight, a sputum showed gram-negative rods and the patient was started on levofloxacin.
The patient underwent a right  upper extremity ultrasound which showed a right cephalic and right internal jugular deep vein thrombosis.
On post-op day 14, the patient continued to do well but a chest x-ray showed a possible right lung collapse.
A bronchoscopy revealed a large amount of mucopurulent secretions in the right middle and lower lobes.
She had experienced no desaturation episodes over the preceding several days.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  In addition to the admitting diagnoses listed above in the past medical history, the patient has adenocarcinoma of her right upper lobe, status post right upper lobectomy, and metastatic carcinoma to her vertebral soft tissue.
