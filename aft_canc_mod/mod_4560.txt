He said that this chest pain started 8pm last night, right-sided, non-pleuritic, continuous, sharp, [**7-6**].
He was initially brought to [**Hospital6 33**] with SOB and hypotension to 70/50 with CXR showing pneumonia.
His chest pain had resolved by the time of arrival, and pressure initially in the low 100s before decreasing to the 80s.
Past Medical History: 1) CAD (cath in [**2161**] showed 3-vessel disease, patient states he had MI [**09**] years ago), presented last hospitalization with NSTEMI believed to be secondary to demand 2) Atrial fibrillation (not on coumadin given h/o GI bleeding) 3) [**Company 1543**] Kappa KDR701 dual-chamber placement 4) Cirrhosis (classified as cryptogenic although patient has history of heavy EtOH use 35 years ago) 5) Chronic kidney disease with baseline Cr 2.7 6) Angiodysplasia of stomach and small intestine with serial endoscopic cauterization ([**2186**]) 7) GI bleeding chronic anemia (multifactorial, thought to be [**12-29**]  kidney disease + GI bleeding) 8) Prior TIA ([**4-3**], ?

No evidence of portal vein thrombosis.
There is a questionable hypoechoic area in the right lobe of the liver.
A liver lesion cannot be completely ruled out in that area given the limited quality of this portable U/S study.
Moderate amount of ascites and a right moderate pleural effusion.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mildly dilated right ventricular cavity with low normal systolic function.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional systolic function.
Trivial pericardial effusion.

In the MICU patient with worsening renal failure, encephalopathy, without clear source of infection.
# Altered Mental Status: Patient had progressive decline of mental status throughout admission, and the etiology was multifactorial likely include hepatic encephalopathy, ICU delirium, and infection.
# Hypotension/tachycardia/hypothermia: Unclear etiology, and likely related with SIRS.
# Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: Crt to 3.2 without clear etiology.
Most likely related to relative hypotension.
Started HRS therapy yesterday without improvement.
# SBP.
This was initially suspected as a possible source of the patient's infection as initial diagnostic para was borderline positive.
# Right pleural effusion.
Patient had a chronic right pleural effusion, but could not lower out a right lower lobe pneumonia.
# Chest pain/recent NSTEMI.
Chest pain had resolved.
