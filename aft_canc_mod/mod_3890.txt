Admission Date:  [**2199-8-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-9-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2147-9-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: MED  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**] Chief Complaint: On intial presentation, abdominal pain.
Transferred to us for possible stenting of L mainstem bronchus occluded by SCC of the lung.
male with a history of heavy alcohol abuse, admitted [**8-27**] to [**Hospital 11485**] Hospital with abdominal pain and found to have pancreatitis with lipase 560.
The same day, he was found to have a L lung whiteout on CXR, further evaluated with chest CT which showed a L hilar mass with pleural effusion.
On [**8-30**] he had a brochoscopy which showed a mass just below the carina and a complete obstruction of the L mainstem bronchus 2-4 cm below the mass.
His pain resolved while at [**Hospital1 11485**] after being NPO for two days.
He does note a 27 pound weight loss since the winter.
He has a chronic cough with some wheezing, without hemoptysis.
Denies IVDU  Family History: Mother had diabetes and was blind.
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds throughout L lung.
Bronchial breath sounds and inspiratory wheezes heard at R base.
Extr: Clubbing of digits, no edema.
Pertinent Results: Imaging: CT torso [**2199-9-2**] - 1) 3.2x3.9 cm hilar mass with extension into subcarinal area, causing complete collapse of the L lung and a large pleural effusion.
Exact borders of pulmonary mass can't be visualized due to lack of IV contrast, but a rough estimate is given at 7.4 x 7.0 cm.
2) Subcentimeter R middle lobe lung nodule 3) Small R pleural effusion 4) Pancreatic calcifications consistent with chronic pancreatitis 5) Chronic calcifications consisten with splenic granulomas  CT head [**2199-9-2**] - Negative unenhanced head CT.  MRI with gadolinium would be helpful if there is clinical suspicion of metastases.
Cavum spetum pellucidum.
Bronchoscopy [**2199-9-4**] - 100% obstruction left main bronchus with tumor.
male transferred from [**Hospital1 11485**] with L mainstem bronchus complete obstruction secondary to SCC, originally admitted for acute pancreatitis.
Unfortunately, the patient has a prior history of a contrast allergy, therefore we performed the CT scan without contrast.
It demonstrated a large pleural effusion on the L side, with a rim of cortex, with complete collapse of the left lung and a large hilar mass.
He was taken to the OR for rigid bronchoscopy with possible stenting on [**9-4**], however during the course of the procedure the patient desaturated to 70 percent, most likely secondary to laryngospasm, and required intubation.
As far as staging goes, the CT scan performed at our hospital did not have contrast, and therefore is not a great study for evaluating for metastases.
Of note, Mr. [**Known lastname 57786**] has an elevated ALP level in the 200s, without transaminase elevation, in addition to an elevated GGT.
2) Streptococcal bacteremia:  The patient ran a low grade fever multiple times duing the course of his stay, with tmax of 102.8 on [**2199-9-3**].
Additionally, wbc increased to 20, and he also developed a thrombocytosis.
Blood cultures were positive for S. Pneumoniae, with a likely source being post-obstructive pneumonia.
He has remained afebrile since starting ceftriaxone.
2) Pancreatitis:  Patient has been without abdominal pain since [**8-29**], and without tenderness on physical exam.
However, he never had symtpoms of withdrawal, and it has now been more than a week since his last drink  4) A-fib: Patient has been in NSR since episode before bronchoscopy at [**Hospital1 11485**].
Was only in AF for a few hours, therefore no need for anticoagulation.
Iron studies indicate an anemia of chronic disease, which could also be alcohol related.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the lung Resolved episode of acute pancreatitis   Discharge Condition: Good.
pneumonia bacteremia - started on the evening of [**9-3**].
