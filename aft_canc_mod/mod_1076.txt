A CXR showed LLL colapse with mediastinal shift to the right and multifocal cavitary lesions.
He has a history of pulmonary aspergillus infection as well as multiple bacteremic episodes (staph epi, stenotrophomonus, staph aureus, micrococcus).
In [**6-/2181**] he was hospitalized for bilateral lung aspergillus infection and enterobacter bacteremia.
He was again admitted from [**Date range (1) 34838**]/05 with pneumonia and bacteremia with Stenotrophomonus treated with a course of bactrim and port-o-cath removal.
He was again admitted to the hospital on [**2182-4-27**] with febrile neutropenia and coag(+) staph blood cultures, micrococcus species, requiring transfer to the ICU for increasing respiratory distress and multi-focal pneumonia.
Hypertension 3.
Remote history of kidney stones 4.

Interval progression of extensive bilateral pulmonary consolidation, most prominent within the left upper and left lower lobe but also involving the remaining lobes centrally, consistent with worsening infectious process.
Increase in moderate left pleural effusion.
Additional numerous nodes within the neck, not meeting criteria for pathologic enlargement.
CXR [**10-18**]: As compared to [**10-16**], there is persistent diffuse opacification of the left lung, consistent with extensive consolidation as well as component of pleural fluid.
There is no associated mediastinal shift to indicate volume loss.
Stable moderate pulmonary edema within the right mid lung as well as improving right basilar subsegmental atelectasis are noted.
CXR [**10-22**]: Multifocal consolidation remains present bilaterally, affecting the left upper lobe and lingula to the greatest degree.
There is some associated mild volume loss in the left upper lobe as well.
Additionally, there is vascular engorgement and perihilar haziness suggesting a component of mild fluid overload.
Bilateral small pleural effusions are noted, left greater than right.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was a 55 y/o male with history of recurrent pulmonary infections, presenting with LLL collapse and febrile neutropenia.
Differential Diagnosis included recurrent pulmonary infection, new pleural effusions, or extrinisic compression.
There was significant concern for fungal infection like mucor.
He was finally intubated and had an increasing oxygen requirement.
