Admission Date:  [**2139-3-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**2139-3-4**]  Date of Birth:   [**2085-1-5**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54-year-old woman with restrictive lung disease and radiation fibrosis secondary to previous radiation therapy for Hodgkin's disease in the [**2106**] and recurrent episodes and admissions for aspiration pneumonia.
She was most recently admitted to the Cardiothoracic Service on [**2139-2-20**], for recurrent aspiration pneumonia and hypercarbia and consideration of decortication surgery on her right lung.
She had worsening shortness of breath, chest tightness, weakness fatigue, and mild cough on admission, which are typical symptoms of her exacerbations.
Her initial arterial blood gas was a pH of 7.24, pCO2 126, and her white count was 8.3 with 3% bands; however, she was afebrile with stable vitals signs and was initially with an oxygen saturation of 96% on 4 L supplemental oxygen.
She had no fever or chills at that time.
She has chronic difficulty with clearing her secretions, and she was given suction treatment repeatedly on the CT Service through her tracheostomy which was placed last summer for suctioning and intermittent ventilatory support as needed.
The secretions were purulent with 4+ PNS and were positive on culture with MRSA and Enterobacter which was sensitive to Meropenem and Gentamicin.
On the Cardiovascular Service, she became somnolescent on [**2-23**], and a repeat arterial blood gas revealed a pCO2 of 133.
She tolerated a trach mask by [**2-24**] and was transferred back to Cardiovascular Surgery on [**2-26**]; however, after that, she became progressively short of breath with worsening cough and increased secretions which were yellowish.
Although decortication procedure on the right lung, previously performed on the left in [**2139-6-7**], was considered, it was felt that the patient must first recover from this bout of aspiration pneumonia and be optimized in terms of her ventilatory support at a rehabilitation facility prior to this procedure.
Stage IIB, treated with chest and abdominal radiation.
Restrictive lung disease with mediastinal radiation fibrosis.
Her status has worsened over the past several years with increasing dyspnea on exertion.
She was forced to retire last summer from her job as a [**Year (4 digits) 9929**] professor due to her illness.
At her best she has three-pillow orthopnea and can climb one flight of stairs on oxygen.
Initially the patient felt that her shortness of breath was improved but now feels that her status has returned to its previous level at baseline before the procedure.
Congestive heart failure.
Ejection fraction of 35-40% on her last cardiac echocardiogram on [**2138-10-21**], with severe anterior, septal, and apical hypokinesis.
Status post pericardectomy for restrictive pericarditis secondary to radiation therapy in the [**2116**].
Status post hysterectomy in [**2113**] for cervical cancer.
History of multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia.
She has a known risk of aspiration.
A video fluoroscopic swallowing study in [**2139-6-7**] revealed difficulty with thin liquids and aspiration risk.
The patient has frequently been positive for MRSA and Enterobacter on previous bronchoalveolar lavages.
Multiple episodes of cardiopulmonary arrest, most recently in [**2138-9-7**].
FAMILY HISTORY:  Her father had lymphoma at age 42, likely non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Her family history is negative for bleeding and clotting disorders and deep venous thrombosis.
There was no lymphadenopathy.
There was a 2/6 systolic murmur.
There was no jugular venous distention.
Chest:  There were a few wheezes anteriorly with coarse bibasilar crackles, worse on the right than on the left.
There were reduced breath sounds at the bases, especially on the right.
Diffuse mild tenderness without rebound.
Extremities:  Warm and well perfused without edema.
STUDIES:  Chest x-ray:  PICC line in place, status post sternotomy and left thoracotomy, interval worsening of bilateral interstitial and alveolar opacities since [**2-26**] with bilateral pleural effusions.
Chest CT on [**2-23**]:  Small bilateral pleural effusion and pleural thickening.
Paramediastinal volume loss and radiation fibrosis with traction bronchiectasis.
Dependent ground glass opacification in the expiratory phase and septal thickening.
No endobronchial lesions.
Electrocardiogram on [**2-24**]:  Sinus tachycardia at 110 with normal intervals and diffuse ST abnormalities without Q-waves.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This 54-year-old woman with chronic restrictive lung disease came to the MICU for ventilatory support in the setting of worsening hypercarbia and recent aspiration pneumonia.
On the second hospital day, her ventilatory support was changed to pressure support at 10 cm; however, the pressure support was increased to 15 because of tidal volumes below 200.
Unfortunately, it appears that at present she requires ventilatory support at least during the night; however, she may be able to tolerate periods without support during the day at a pulmonary rehabilitation facility.
Infectious disease:  On the night of admission, she briefly had a fever to 101.3??????
Genitourinary:  No urinary symptoms.
Hematology:  Her baseline hematocrit has ranged from 26 to 33 over the past year, and in mid [**2138**], she was treated with Epogen.
The anemia is normocytic and borderline hypochromic.
Because of her relative hypotension and high eosinophil count (750), which has been recurrent over the past year, a morning Cortisol was drawn and found to be 14.
Neuropsychiatric:  Her mental status deteriorated during episodes of hypercarbia and alkalemia, but for two days, she has been very alert.
She has a history of depression and was recently seen by Psychiatry who felt that she has an adjustment disorder to her current condition.
This is being discontinued at discharge, but appropriate prophylaxis for DVT is recommended.
She had hypophosphatemia to phosphate of 1.1 which was replaced.
Her pneumonia is resolving, and she is continuing on a course of Vancomycin and Meropenem IV via her PICC line for three weeks.
Aspiration pneumonia.
Restrictive lung disease with radiation fibrosis.
Congestive heart failure.
