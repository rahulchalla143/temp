Admission Date:  [**2193-2-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2193-2-14**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: SOB, chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization w/ [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5175**] to LMCA, LAD and LCx IABP placement Swan-Ganz catheter placement Intubation and mechanical ventilation R IJ placement  History of Present Illness: 82 yo F with known CAD (details unknown) who is reported to have developed SOB without chest pain/pressure on [**2193-2-7**] p.m. although with GERD like symptoms.
Per discussion with the patient's family, the patient had episodes of shortness of breath starting one week prior that were self limiting.
The patient was found to be dyspneic with respiratory rate in the 40s, but was reported to be A+O x3.
In the ED the patient's ECG was remarkable for NSR at 115bpm with LBBB (presumed to be new, but not definitely known given none for comparison) with BP 144/77, O2 Sat 90% on NRB with rales bilaterally with 1+ LE edema.
The patient was intubated for respiratory failure with subsequent development of hypotension with SBP in the 90's.
Given LBBB and hypotension there was concern for ACS for which the patient was given a 25cc bolus of integrillin with subsequent gtt, Heparin, Plavix 300mg, ASA and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cath.
The patient had an emergent echo that revealed EF 25%, 3+ MR, [**12-17**]+ TR, with apical hypokinesis/akinesis.
CT surgery was consulted given the extensive CAD but did not feel the patient was an operative candidate given the hypotension, acidosis and poor distal targets.
The patient's course was additionally complicated by episode of VT in the cath lab x 1 minutem which terminated before DCCV was performed.
Of note, the patient had 800cc urine output at the end of the case without diuresis   Past Medical History: Hypercholesterolemia Hypertension Acid reflux disease Peptic ulcer disease Hypothyroidism Diverticulosis   Social History: (per OMR) Pt lives alone.
Gen: Patient is an obese female, intubated and sedated HEENT: ETT in place, small bleeding at corner of mouth Neck: JVP difficult to assess secondary to ETT and securing straps Chest: Transmitted breath sounds from vent, otherwise geenrally CTA Anterior and Lat Cor: RRR, Normal S1/S2.
Hypoactive bowel sounds Ext: Right groin: IABP line in place, dressing saturated with sanguinous fluid Left groin: Dressing in place over swan and a-line - mod/severely stained with sanguinous fluid.
Anatomy: MID RCA - diffusely diseased, 70% stenosis R PDA- diffusely diseased, 90% stenosis R POST-LAT - diffusely diseased, 70% stenosis LMCA - discrete, 90% stenosis PROX LAD - discrete, 90% stenosis MID LAD - discrete, 100% stenosis PROXIMAL LCX - discrete, 80% stenosis MID LCX - tubular, 95% stenosis .
Selective coronary angiography in this critically ill patient revealed severe three vessel CAD.
The LMCA had a 70% origin stenosis and a 90% distal stenosis extending into the LAD.
The LAD also had a mid 100% occlusion and supplies a one large septal.
The LCX was diffusely disease with a 80% origin stenosis and a long 95% mid stenosis.
The RCA was diffusely diseased with 70% mid stenosis, 90% PDA stenosis and a 70% posterolateral.
Initial resting hemodynamics revealed severe cardiogenic shock with elevation of right and left sided pressures (RA mean 26 and PCWP mean 46mmHG).
There was severe pulmonary hypertension with mean of 54mmHG.
Initial PH was 7.09 with metabolic and respiratory acidosis.
Echo was performed during the case showing EF about 25% with  moderately severe mitral regurgitation and akinesis in LAD territory.
Urgent surgical consult was obtained and patient was declined due to poorly amenable anatomy and severe metabolic and hemodynamic derangements.
Three vessel coronary artery disease with critical left main disease.
Severe cardiogenic shock.
ECHO [**2193-2-8**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include mid to distal anteroseptal akinesis, apical akinesis, lateral hypokinesis, and anterior hypokinesis.
No apical thrombus seen but cannot exclude.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a Swan-Ganz catheter entering from inferior approach.
There remains a left retrocardiac opacity and subsegmental atelectasis at the left base.
Blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles are identified consistent with pleural effusions.
There remains some cardiomegaly.
There are bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 F with PMH hyperchol, HTN with STEMI not amenable to CABG ([**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], LAD), with cardiogenic shock, who eventually passed away.
# STEMI and cardiogenic shock: (1) Ischemia: Patient had significant CAD on cath s/p DES to LMain, LAD, LCX.
During cath, results showed 3VD with critical left main disease, and severe cardiogenic shock.
A balloon pump was placed in the CCU for cardiogenic shock, and the balloon pump was successfully removed with good hemodynamic control.
The patient remained sedated and intubated, so whether the patient was experiencing CP or symptoms could not be assessed.
She was not given BB/ACE because of cardiogenic shock.
Resp Failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for resp failure, presumed [**1-17**] to CHF and 3+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] maintained good oxygenation and ventilation, patient had a difficult time being weaned from the vent.
ID: Patient had signs of sepsis in the CCU, with temp spikes, low SVR, and hyperdynamic CO/CI.
Source of sepsis was not found, and IABP and PA catheter were appropriately removed.
Patient was not given synthroid inhouse because of ventricular arrhythmia early during admission.
