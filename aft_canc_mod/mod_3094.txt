HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46 year old male with a three month history of increasing left neck mass, who presented on this admission for panendoscopy and biopsy of the lesion.
Intraoperative frozen section to the left neck mass during surgery demonstrated squamous cell carcinoma and surgery was thus converted to a left modified radical neck dissection, which proceeded without complication.
Biopsies were taken from the left tonsillar fossa, the nasopharynx and these accompanied the neck dissection.
In general, he is a large obese male, sedated, and intubated.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - normocephalic and atraumatic.
He has an endotracheal tube in place and a large incision in the left neck is clean, dry and intact with two [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains in place.
In the early postoperative period, there is no evidence of hematoma formation.
On chest examination, he has coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
Cardiovascular - he is tachycardic but with normal S1 and S2 with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The abdomen is large and obese but soft and nontender.
Extremity examination - He has no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 46 year old male who was admitted for panendoscopy and biopsy of a left neck mass.
Intraoperatively, frozen section of the left neck mass revealed squamous cell carcinoma.
Biopsies were taken of the nasopharynx and the left tonsillar fossa and surgery was converted to a left modified radical neck dissection, which proceeded without event and leaving the placement of two [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains.
His postoperative course was initially complicated by difficulty weaning from the ventilator and concerns were raised over the safety of monitoring this gentleman on a regular floor given his history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and difficulty weaning from the ventilator.
On postoperative day zero, he was left intubated due to difficulty to wean from the ventilator with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease thought to be the likely barrier to extubation.
There were no further respiratory issues throughout his hospital course.
Cardiovascularly, he was initially found to be tachycardic with the thought that this was likely secondary to respiratory difficulty and to pain.
Electrocardiogram obtained was unremarkable and there were no further cardiovascular issues.
Hematologically, there were no issues.
He had a stable hematocrit and only 400 ccs of intraoperative blood loss.
There were no hematologic issues throughout the hospital stay.
The [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains were subsequently removed on postoperative day four and five for declining output and due to no evidence of fluid collection or hematoma.
The incision was clean, dry and intact with intact staples and with no evidence of dehiscence.
His neck was flat with no evidence of fluid collection.
There was no intraoral blood.
He was tolerating full diet, ambulating, voiding without difficulty and no discomfort.
