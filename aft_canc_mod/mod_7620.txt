Admission Date:  [**2137-5-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-6-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2061-9-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Neurontin  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 495**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracentesis  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 year old female with a PMH significant for metastatic colon cancer on palliative cetuximab therapy admitted to the MICU for dyspnea and hypoxia.
The patient reports that she has had progresive shortness of breath over the past 2 weeks such that she was dyspneic with minimal activity inclduing activities such as showering.
She denies any orthopnea, PND, increased LE edema, CP, f/c/s, or productive cough.
Upon infusion of cetuximab, she developed acute worsening of her dyspnea and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation.
An ECG was notable for afib with RVR, CXR for right-sided pleural effusion and diffuse parenchymal opacities, and a large right-sided pleural effusion, and CTA was negative for PE.
Cardiology was called in the ED and based on ECG and cardiac biomarkers, elevated TnT was felt to be secondary to demand ischemia but recommended heparin gtt.
Past Medical History: Colon CA Hypothyroid Hyperlipidemia Iron deficiency anemia Gastritis .
Oncologic history: Metastatic colon cancer, status post five cycles of FOLFOX and Avastin on protocol, which was completed in [**2135-4-10**].
Chemotherapy was resumed in [**2135-9-10**] in the setting of rising CEA and CT evidence of disease progression.
She had a rise in her CEA and therefore her regimen was switched to FOLFIRI and Avastin on [**2136-7-20**].
Her second cycle of therapy, bolus 5-FU was reduced by 25% in the setting of mucositis and vaginal irritation.
She had a rise in her CEA in addition to interval disease progression at the end of [**Month (only) 1096**] and therefore she was started on single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] cetuximab and has received 13 doses.
Family History: Father died of colon cancer @about 77.
Sister died of ovarian cancer @57.
Mother died of CHF @56.
Dullness to percussion at right base [**1-11**] way up lung field.
Abd: S/NT/ND +bs Ext: No c/c/e   Pertinent Results: [**2137-6-1**] 04:32PM PLEURAL WBC-283* Hct,Fl-2* Polys-35* Lymphs-51* Monos-13* Eos-1* [**2137-6-1**] 04:32PM PLEURAL TotProt-5.2 Glucose-116 LD(LDH)-934  [**2137-6-1**] 4:32 pm PLEURAL FLUID     GRAM STAIN (Final [**2137-6-1**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2137-6-4**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
CTA ([**5-31**]): No pulmonary embolism.
Stable large right-sided pleural effusion with slightly more collapse of the right lower lobe.
CTH ([**5-31**]): No acute intracranial path  TTE ([**6-4**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF < 20 %) with some preservation of the basal inferior and inferolateral walls.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with relative preservation of the basal inferior and inferolateral walls.
Right ventricular dilation and dysfunction.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 year old female with metastatic colon cancer admitted from oncology clinic with sub-acute dyspnea.
On CT chest review, parenchymal disease burden is worse compared to last CT scan performed prior to admission, and right lower lobe is now completely collapsed.
Respiratory decline unlikely to be PE given negative CTA.
There was initial concern given tumor burden for malignant pericardial effusion with resulting hypoxia and tachyarrythmia, but CT and TTE did not demonstrate significant pericardial effusion.
The patient was placed on BiPaP in the ED and had a persistent BiPaP requirement during her admission for comfort.
She had a diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis with exudative pleural fluid based on Light's criteria with cytology pending at the time of death.
Serial CXR after therapeutic paracentesis was performed were notable for reaccumulation of pleural effusion, and attempts at weaning BiPaP were unsuccessful.
During her hospital course, she intermitently had runs of narrow complex tachycardia with a ventricular rate up to 220 that was minimally responsive to AV nodal blockade with IV metoprolol and diltiazem.
# CV: Increase in TnT during admission likely represented demand ischemia rather than ACS in setting of tachyarrythmia.
BNP was also elevated to 700 on admission suggesting element of heart failure that may have been rate-related.
