He was foound to have a large, hilar based, non-small cell lung cancer of the right upper lobe causing compression/obliteration of the superior segment bronchus.
Metastatic work-up included PET imaging and a brain MRI revealing a metastatic focus to his brain that necessitated craniotomy and cyberknife therapy (cyberknife was done to the surgical bed when it was thought that he recurred).
Ultimately, he [**Year (2 digits) 1834**] a platinum based neoadjuvant chemo/XRT regimen for his primary lung cancer and serial CT imaging showed no evidence of disease progression.
A pre-operative bronchoscopy w/ washings and mediastinoscopy still showed that the disease was only locally advanced and a likely Stage IIIa hilar based NSLC was opted for surgical therapy.
On [**2112-1-1**], he was admitted for a Right Thoracotomy, Right Upper Lobe Sleeve Resection with Primary Bronchoplasty and Intercostal Muscle Flap.
Past Medical History: NSCLC (oligometastatic to the brain) Hypercholesterolemia Coronary artery disease (MI in [**2106**] with sent placement) No HTN, DM or COPD  Past Oncolgic History: Diagnosed with NSCLC by transbronchial biopsy on [**2111-6-4**].
[**Name (NI) **] does not have any children.
Family History: Grandfather died of lung cancer (non-smoking related).
Mother died of myocardial infarction.

The patient did well intraoperatively and was resuscitated with 2 units of PRBCs (EBL ~ 600cc) as well as several liters of isotonic crystalloid.
Neuro- his pain control was adequate with a thoracic epidural which was ultimately removed on POD#4 and converted to an oral regimen; he had no evidence of delerium/anxiety-NOS; per-operative ambien/zyprexa were continued at his home doses.
Pulmonary- His chest tubes were removed on POD#3 with no demonstration of air leak and outputs less than 150cc q24hr interval.
Post-removal chest film demonstrated satisfactory position of the lung with adeuate expansion, minimal effusion and no real volume overload.
Cardiovascular- he developed Afib w/ a RVR ~ 36hrs post-operatively necessitating ICU transfer and neosynephrine/amiodarone supplementation.
He had no evidence of coronary ischemia by ECG and his relative hypotension experienced during the acute setting of the Afib was asymptomatic.
He was diuresed for a number of days post-operatively, however, he never significantly demonstrated a weight gain post-operatively and he had no major oxygenation/ventilation problems.
Endocrine- he was transiently given SSIR for peri-operative glycemic control/prophylaxis HEME/ID- he remained afebril with no outstanding infectious disease issues during his post-operative convalescence.
He received 2 additional doses of kefzol immediately post-operatively and his surgical site incisions appeared C/D/I.
His pre-operative Hct = 30, he was transfused 2 units intraoperatively and a total of 2 untis were transfused for Blood Loss Anemia during his 5 day post-operative course.
