Admission Date:  [**2191-11-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2191-11-24**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2745**] Chief Complaint: Palpitations  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 83 M with pmhx of afib, cva, recent dx of high grade glioma in l cerebral peduncle) was enroute to [**Hospital1 18**] for 1st session xrt, transport noted he was tachypneic, also had aspiration event.
He was started on oxygen, at XRT he was noted to have a O2 sat of 97, but w/ an irregular rapid HR 158. .
Has felt subjective shortness of breath and feverish for x1 week, no cough.
Past Medical History: L high grade glioma (left cerebral peduncle and posterior limb of the left internal capsule) atrial fibrillation (?atrial flutter), diagnosed [**6-11**] - was on coumadin HTN Hyperlipidemia CVA, [**6-11**] (left inferior quadrantanopsia from a right medial occipital infarct) presbycusis (pt wears hearing aids) right carpal tunnel syndrome (well controlled with wrist splint worn at night) PVD with claudication for several years (followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] PEG placed [**2191-11-11**] probalance full: @ 75 cc/hr .
comfortable HEENT: PERRL, dentures, OP Clear, dry MM, No JVD Chest: Coarse rales possible left base CV: tachy irreg ireg no mrg GI: Soft +BS nt/nd, PEG tube EXT; no c/c/e Neuro: hemiparesis of R side with pronounced facial droop and some impairment of his EOM.
STUDIES EKG: aflutter variable block, and afib, tachy 112, irreg, NA, no ST-T changes.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
Slight decrease in size of bilateral pleural effusions.
Calcified pleural plaques consistent with prior asbestos exposure.
Small hiatal hernia.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Stable size and mild mass effect of mass lesions within the left cerebral peduncle and posterior limb of the left internal capsule.
Increased internal hypoattenuation within these lesions could represent interval necrosis.
Of note, if further evaluation of the known underlying mass lesions is required, an [**Month/Year (2) 4338**] with gadolinium would be recommended.
TTE [**2191-11-22**]: Left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is  not present The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2191-1-28**], there is rapid ventricular response to atrial fibrillation.
The biventricular function and valvular regurgitation are similar.
Brief Hospital Course: 83 yo male with PMH of afib, high grade glioma who presented with afib/flutter with RVR in the 150s, hemodynamically stable.
Cardiovascular)  Patient presented with atrial flutter/fibrillation perhaps triggered by hypovolemia.
Since hypovolemia appeared to be a trigger for the patient's a-fib with RVR and since he has poor po intake, on discharge the patient's lasix was decreased from 40 mg po qd to 20 mg po qd.
Aspiration PNA- The patient's levaquin/flagyl for question of aspiration pneumonia was completed on [**11-23**]  Thrombocytopenia-The patient had decreasing platelets since [**11-15**] down to 89 on [**11-21**].
Speech and swallow evaluated the patient and noted that he is a silent aspiration risk and instructed that the patient not take any meds by mouth.
Lasix 20 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: NEW MED DOSE, DECREASED FROM LASIX 40 mg po qd due to poor po intake and hypovolemia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 169**] Center  Discharge Diagnosis: Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response   Discharge Condition: Vital Signs Stable   Discharge Instructions: Return to ED if short of breath, chest pain/pressure, palpitations with symptoms of discomfort.
