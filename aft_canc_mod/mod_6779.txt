No abdominal cramping or pain.
She denies fevers, chills, N/V, or decreased PO intake in days leading up to admission.

Sclera anicteric.
NECK: Supple with no JVD.

<b><u>IMAGING/RADIOLOGY<B><U> EKG on [**2198-7-30**]: Normal sinus rhythm with indeterminate axis.
ST-T wave changes are suggestive of ischemia in the anteroapical region.
(When compared to previous EKG's from OSH from as long a [**8-3**] mos ago no significant changes) .
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the distal half of the septum and anterior walls, distal inferior and lateral walls, and apex.
with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Extensive regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution and extending to apical right ventricle).
Apical left ventricular aneurysm/large mural thrombus.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
VENOUS LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLERS ([**2198-7-30**]): No DVT seen in either leg.
Persantine Stress Test [**2198-8-1**]: IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or ST segment changes in response to dipyridamole infusion.
Fixed distal anterior and inferior as well as apical defects along the distal anterior and inferior walls as well as apex consistent with known anterior wall MI with apical aneurysm.
Images at the apex are limited but there is likely paradoxical motion of the known left apical ventricular aneurysm.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 80-year old female with h/o type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recent diagnosis of pancreatic cancer who presents from OSH s/p mechanical fall with hypotension and elevated cardiac markers.
# PUMP/HYPOTENSION:  Per OSH records, she had hypotension to SBP 70 and subsequently received a 700 cc bolus of NS with bump in SBP to 100 at time of transfer.
Differential diagnosis on admission for her hypotension included cardiogenic causes (principally acute MI, pericardial tamponade, or pulmonary embolism) versus distributive causes (sepsis) versus hypovolemia from decreased PO intake and recent diarrhea.
A TTE on night of admission showed LVEF 30-35% and regional systolic dysfunction in the distribution of the mid-LAD.
There was an apical left ventricular aneurysm and mural thrombus.
There was no significant pericardial effusion.
Her blood pressure increase in response to fluid boluses suggested that the main cause for her hypotension was hypovolemia in the context of generally well compensated systolic heart failure.
Ultimately, we were able to obtain outside EKGs, which showed Q waves suggesting her MI had occurred greater than six months ago and that her decreased EF and systolic heart failure had been well compensated to this point with minimal symptomatology especially given her sedentary lifestyle.
Initially, she had been started on heparin and then coumadin for anticoagulation of the LV thrombus, but after concluding that her LV dysfunction and aneurysm had been present for several months we discontinued this anticoagulation given the generally stable nature of long-standing clots and minimal risk of embolization.
She was also restarted on ACEI and restarted on a BB when her blood pressure recovered for her hypovolemia as part of a good CHF regimen.
She never had signs of fluid overload or decompensated heart failure while in the hospital.
# CAD/ISCHEMIA:  At time of presentation, she had no known history of coronary artery disease.
As above, her echocardiogram was strongly suggestive of apical ischemia and showed Q waves suggestive of old MI.
Large wall motion abnormality and aneurysmal dilation of LV was consistent with this.
Her treating team believed this was most consistent with demand ischemia in the context of hypotension as opposed to ACS.
She had previously been on a statin for known hyperlipidemia but this had been discontinued due her transaminitis (in the setting of biliary obstruction from pancreatic CA) in [**2198-6-22**].
A persantine stress test was performed prior to hospitalization and showed no reversible ischemia.
She had several bouts of atrial tachycardia that were managed by up-titrating her beta blocker dose.
She was asymptomatic and remained hemodynamically stable during these events.
# DIARRHEA:  Initially, given her previous course of ciprofloxacin and diarrhea with hypotension on presentation she was started on IV metronidazole for empiric therapy of C. diff.
Given her abdominal exam remained benign and the quick resolution of her hypotension we became less concerned for C diff and/or toxic megacolon.
Most likely this was simply antibiotic associated diarrhea vs a viral enteritis.
# POSITIVE BLOOD CULTURE:  On admission she had blood cultures drawn as part of a general hypotension work up.
On hospital day two one out of two of these cultures turned positive for gram positive cocci.
Thus, given the etiology of hypotension was still unclear and we were unsure of the organism, vancomycin was started empirically.
This was discontinued when the culture was speciated as coagulase negative staph as this organism in [**11-22**] blood cultures is likely to represent a contaminant.
# HTN:  When her blood pressure permitted, we restarted her outpatient BB and started her on an ACEI for its cardioprotective effect.
Hydrochlorthiazide was held and not restarted so as to give her the most room for increased ACEI and BB.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was fed a cardiac/heart healthy and diabetic diet.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because your blood pressure was low and some of the enzymes in your blood were elevated indicating that you may have suffered a heart attack.
With further testing we do not believe you had an acute blockage in a vessel in your heart.
Your EKG showed an old heart attack so your couamdin (warfarin) was discontinued.
Your stress test did not show any evidence that your heart is not getting enough blood flow at present.
