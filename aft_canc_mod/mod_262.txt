Past history: # Colon mass during colonoscopy for guaiac positive stools in [**2184**].
Pathology was worrisome for carcinoma.
Although the patient was offered resection by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], he declined # hematuria/BPH - traumatic foley insertion and manipulation [**3-16**] lead to urosepsis and subsequent urinary retention # sick sinus syndrome and bifascicular block s/p pacemaker [**2184**]  # PAF - on amiodarone, not on coumadin d/t concern for malignancy # H/O SVT # Atrial flutter status post ablation [**2-/2186**] - not on anticoagulation d/t concern for malignancy # Anemia - on arenesp and iron # Echo [**2186**]: mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, RA and LA # BPH s/p TURMP [**2187**] # b/l edema with skin changes # hard of hearing # hx of guiaic positive stools/GI bleeding # osteoarthritis # osteoporosis # subclinical hypothyroid state as per record # renal insufficiency # right pleural effusion - Found on CT on [**2188-2-25**] for increasing DOE.

Workup during last admission revealed RV diastolic dysfunction.
Concern was for PE as etiology, but unable to get CTA d/w ARF and V/Q not helpful.
Not anticoagulated due to h/o GIB, pleurodesis not an option d/t transudative.

with multiple medical problems including untreated colon cancer, BPH, chronic foley, afib, diastolic heart failure and chronic right sided pleural effusion who presents with fevers/chills, hypotension, and urinary retention from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
# Hypotension - Believed by ICU team to be secondary to preseptic physiology secondary to UTI and melena.
# GIB -Patient with melena on presentation.
EGD [**5-12**] revealed a single non-bleeding erosion in the antrum of the stomach.
# Urinary retention - Etiology from traumatic foley placement during admission in [**2-29**], followed by urology and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] as an outpatient.
Foley currently draining well without clots after manipulation overnight.
#UTI) [**5-10**] urine culture no growth but patient with symptoms of UTI and equivocal u/a in setting of hypotension with indwelling foley and thus was presumptively started on abx by ED and ICU.
# CKD - Currently at baseline.
Cr 1.1  #Colon CA)  Patient underwent colonoscopy on [**5-15**] that revealed pseudomembranous colitis, two polyps and his earlier colonic mass at the hepatic flexure.
Per GI, there is concern for future risk of obstruction from mass.
