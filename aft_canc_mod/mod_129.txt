Admission Date:  [**2132-3-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-4-2**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5608**] Chief Complaint: abnormal CXR, anemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation central line placement bronchoscopy arterial line placement  History of Present Illness: The patient is an 84M with prostate CA, CAD, HTN who presents with 2 weeks dry cough.
He saw his hematologist who ordered a CXR for the cough, and it showed extensive heterogenous opacification in the right lung.
Because of these abnormal findings, his PCP told him to come to the ED for evaluation.
He has had the intermittent dry cough for about two weeks but has not had fevers, chills, weight loss, change in appetite, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.
He has noticed some fatigue, as he used to walk two miles a day until the cough started, but notes he is limited by fatigue, not DOE.
No other symptoms.
In the ED he was noted to have a dropping Hct (25.4, down from 29.6 the previous day).
He was being worked up for anemia and was not found to have evidence of iron, folate or B12 deficiency in [**2-4**].

Small surgical clips are seen along the left cardiac border, compatible with prior CABG.
There is mild cardiomegaly.
There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
New, extensive, heterogeneous opacification is seen predominately in the right lung, with peripheral consolidation and lesser degree of central opacification.
Right- sided volume loss suggests a chronic process.
Left basilar opacities are compatible with atelectasis, and the left lung is otherwise clear.
IMPRESSION: Compared to [**2124**] study, new extensive heterogeneous opacification in the right lung with peripheral consolidation and lesser degree of central opacification.
Loss of right lung volume suggests a subacute process.
[**3-11**] CXR: No interval change over one day in appearance of diffuse airspace opacity involving the right hemithorax.
Original differential diagnosis stands and multifocal pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Small layering bilateral non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions are increased on the right and new on the left.
Diffuse extensive areas of ground-glass opacity, peribronchial consolidation, and bronchiectasis have worsened in the left lung, minimally improved in the right upper lobe.
Transvenous pacemaker lead terminates in a standard position.
There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.
Calcification in the aortic valve is of unknown hemodynamic significance.
AP window and prevascular lymph nodes have increased in size; for instance, to 8 mm from 5 mm and to 5 mm from 3 mm respectively.
This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, and the upper abdomen is unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Worsening of pre-existing opacity in the left lung and slight improvement of the abnormalities in the right upper lobe  The left atrium is normal in size.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the anterior septum, anterior wall and apex.
There is mild hypokinesis of the inferior septum and inferior wall.
There is an anteroapical left ventricular aneurysm.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: severe regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent with multi-vessel CAD.
No significant valvular abnormality seen.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are higher on the current study   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 5609**] is an 85 yo M with CAD s/p CABG/ICD,CHF ef20% prostate ca who presents with dry cough found to have diffuse right sided patchy peripheral opacities on cxr, transferred to the ICU for hypoxia.
Due to progressive decline and poor prognosis, family decided to make him comfort measures only and patient passed away on [**2132-4-2**] 17:10.
Initial bronchoscopy revealed high eosinophilia and he was felt to have eosinophilic pneumonia and treated with a course of steroids although he did not have a dramatic improvement in his resp status.
Shortly after this, he was transferred to the ICU for worsening hypoxia and intubated.
Repeat CT chests showed worsening  progression of disease adn well as new infiltrates concerning for infectious etiology.
Initially, it was also felt there was a component of pulm edema and he was aggressively diuresed.
At this point, after meeting w/ family and CT Surgery, it was felt that VATS was not an option given his tenuous status.
Sputum culture ultimately with sparse orpharyngeal flora.
VAP pneumonia - s/p bronch, infectious studies with no obvious source.
Sputum culture ultimately with sparse orpharyngeal flora.
On CT, infiltrate had the appearance of progressive underlying process rather than new consolidation.
Fever and infiltrate on CXR may not really have been VAP but rather part of underlying lung disease.
# Diffuse right peripheral infiltrates - BAL 30% eosinophils, also with peripheral eosinophilia most likely [**12-31**] acute eosinophilic pneumonia.
PCP negative, respiratory viral antigens neg, BAl neg for bacterial pathogens.
Per pulmonary consult, he may have "eosinophilic process secondary to malignancy or something like a non-steroid responsive BOOP".
# Fever: During his hospital course, he intermittently had high fevers with no clear infectious etiology isolated.
Urine sediment revealed muddy brown casts c/w ATN.
# LUE DVT - increased welling L>R, confirmed on U/S [**3-27**] to involve axillary and probably brachial veins.
# Anemia: he was noted to have anemia since [**2-4**], slowly trending down but without any acute drops and no evidence of bleeding.
No evidence of hemolysis on admission.
Bone marrow biopsy showed anemia of chronic dz, maybe MDS.
Found to have warm autoimmune ab.
# Warm autoimmune Ab: previously no evidence of hemolysis with elevated haptoglobin.
Hapto/LDH not suggestive of hemolysis.
# VT/ NSVT, SSS, s/p PM/ICD:  has had runs of VT; likely in setting of intubation.
Had 2 further episodes of SVT [**3-26**], ECG w/ new T-wave changes but CEs negative x3.
# CAD s/p MI/CABG: no evidence of acute ischmia on arrival to ICU, chest pain free.
EKG with LBBB at baseline, no change.
[**3-27**] ECG w/ new T-wave changes but CEs negative x3.
# h/o prostate cancer: receiving hormonal therapy q3 months but patient reports his treatment was skipped this month due to his symptoms.
