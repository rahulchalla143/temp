Says she has chronic shortness of breath which has not changed recently.
While she was on gemcitabine, she experienced significant fatigue, decreased appetite, early satiety, and weight loss, as well as increased dyspnea that required a therapeutic thoracentesis on [**2139-3-17**].
No cough, fevers.
There was some dullness to percussion at the right lung base.
EKG was sinus with no ischemic changes.
Patient was given protonix/gi cocktail with some improvement of symptoms but still had some chest discomfort.
Patient was transferred to the MICU for EGD and concern for possible inability to protect her airway after sedation.
While being prepped for the EGD, after having benzocaine spray administered to her oropharynx, she suddenly became hypoxic to the 80s and was noted to have rhonchi throughout all lung fields.
In the ICU, the patient underwent EGD which showed partially digested food boluses in the distal esophagus with esophagitis.
On presentation, she feels well and denies abdominal pain, SOB, or other pain.
Denies h/o dysphagia or odynophagia.
No diarrhea or constipation or dysuria.
Uses cane to ambulate long distances but otherwise no limitations.

[**2139-4-9**] CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY:       FECES NEGATIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
[**2139-4-5**] CT Chest: Markedly thickened distal esophageal wall with proximal dilatation.
There is distal air suggesting some amount of patency.
There is no evidence of tracheal compression.
Again seen are linear opacities at the right base possibly representing atelectasis versus scar.
Persistent small-to-moderate right-sided pleural effusion is seen, little changed from prior.
Left-sided granuloma again noted.
Impression: Little change from prior study with persistent small-to-moderate right pleural effusion.
[**2139-4-6**] CXR: Persistent bibasilar infiltrates and right pleural effusion.
Subtle evidence for development of mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
[**2139-4-5**] EGD: Findings - Esophagus:   1) Lumen: There appeared to be a small Schatzki's ring at the gastroesophageal junction, but this will need to be reassessed once the small pieces of food have passed.
3) Mucosa: Esophagitis with erythema, mucosal edema, and congestion was seen in the distal esophagus that was most likely due to the food impaction.
IMPRESSION: 1) Food in the whole Esophagus 2) Esophagitis 3) Schatzki's ring 4) Otherwise normal EGD to stomach antrum  Brief Hospital Course: 86F w/ stage IV ovarian Ca, asthma, HTN, GERD p/w epigastric pain.
She was given local anesthtic for endoscopy and became acutely hypoxic requiring intubation for procedure (?aspiration).
Endoscopy showed food stuck in the distal esophagus which was removed.
Her pain resolved s/p EGD and she was extuabated the following morning.
S&S eval negative for aspiration.
## Sinus tachycardia, hypertension: Thought possibly related to pain and anxiety, and was minimal response to IVFs.
## Hypoxia: Transient hypoxia peri-EGD likely due to aspiration pneumonitis/PNA and treated with 7 day course levofloxacin and flagyl.
Also with elevated BNP and some evidence of fluid overload and was given lasix with good effect.
## Ovarian CA: Stage IV with h/o prior malignant effusions.
s/p first cycle of gemcitabine on [**2139-2-23**] complicated by fatigue, anorexia, dyspnea (required therapeutic thoracentesis by IR on [**2139-3-17**]).
Transfused 1 unit pRBC as anemia due to underproduction from chemotherapy.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Disp:*1 months supply* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Esophagitis Anemia Aspiration pneumonia  Secondary: Ovarian cancer Asthma Hypertension  Discharge Condition: Good  Discharge Instructions: You were evaluated for abdominal pain, underwent endoscopy, and found to have food lodged in your esophagus which was removed.
There was inflammation of the esophagus and you will need a repeat endoscopy to make sure this inflammation has resolved.
During the procedure, you had trouble breathing and required intubation and mechanical ventilation overnight.
You have an aspiration pneumonia and are being treated with antibiotics which you should complete even if you are feeling better.
