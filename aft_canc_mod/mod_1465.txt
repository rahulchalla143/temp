Admission Date:  [**2123-4-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2123-4-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2046-10-16**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea, Tachycardia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 76 year old female with medical history pertinent for cholangiocarcinoma diagnosed in [**2112**], unresectable at time of diagnosis, treated with 5-FU and radiation therapy as well as bilateral metal biliary stents who now presents with concerns for dyspnea, tachycardia and LE edema.
The patient's course has been complicated by biliary obstruction from her stents with recurrent cholangitis and hepatic abscesses.
The patient has undergone placement of a plastic stent in her metal stent with decrease in episodes of cholangitis.
The patient has had hepatic collection cultures revealing for Klebsiella oxytoca and Strep Milleri on [**7-31**] for which patient was on CTX and levofloxacin.
The patient seemed to tolerate transition from IV to PO meds although ID note on [**2123-2-24**] noted rising trend in WBC concerning for worsening of underlying infection.
In addition to above the patient has been noted to have an additional issue of weight loss and abdominal distention.
The patient was seen by her gastroenterologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] on [**2123-3-19**] with plan for interventional radiology consultation for evaluation of percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography for biliary drainage, impression that repeat ERCP would be of limited utility given obstructing metal ducts.
Plan was also made for upper and lower endoscopy to rule out bowel obstruction.
The patient now presents from her PCPs office who presents with concern for ongoing loss of energy, weight loss, abdominal distention, lower extremity edema and dyspnea on exertion.
In the office the patient was noted to have a heart rate of 120 with dyspnea on minimal exertion.
The patient was referred to the ED for evaluation with concern for PE or Tamponade.
The patient had a CT C/A/P revealing no PE or pericardial effusion, did reveal interval increase in size of multiple superinfected bilomas with additional finding of marked distention of the stomach, filled with debris as well as mild to moderate ascites, no obvious obstruction to account for gastric dilation.
The patient received 1L NS, no medications, and was transferred to the medical service for ongoing management.
Past Medical History: Onc Hx:  She was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma in [**2112**] after presenting to [**Hospital6 1708**] with painless jaundice.
ERCP was unsuccessful in stenting the lesion and she underwent bilateral percutaneous cholangiograms with external drain placement and eventual internalization of the drains.
As the tumor seemed to grow up the hepatic artery, it was deemed unresectable.
Over the past nine years, she has had multiple admissions for cholangitis and obstruction of the biliary drainage system by sludge and stones.

No pulmonary embolism.
Increase in size of multiple intrahepatic bilomas, several of which appear to rim enhance consistent with superinfection.
Moderate ascites.
Marked gastric distension warrants decompression.
Multiple hepatic abscesses containing debris.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment/Plan: The patient is a 76 year old female with history of cholangiocarcinoma s/p 5-FU and radiation, chronic biliary obstruction with infected bilomas/hepatic abscess now presents with abdominal distention, LE edema, dyspnea.
76 year old female with cholangiocarcinoma diagnosed in [**2112**], s/p 5-FU and radiation, chronic biliary obstruction with infected bilomas/hepatic abscess on augmentin/levo/fluconazole suppression presented [**4-5**] from PCPs office with abdominal distention, LE edema, dyspnea found to have duodenal obstructing mass on ERCP [**4-9**] complicated by hypoxia and aspiration event.
# Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient s/p reintubation.
Patient was intubated after ERCP for hypoxia.
After intubation, patient's airway was suctioned and revealed aspiration contents that are likely reason for patient's hypoxia.
She is s/p bronchoscopy and a small piece of food (likely meat) was suctioned from her LUL which corresponded to her LUL collapse on CXR.
Her sputum was sent for cx and is growing yeast with pseudohyphae and gram + cocci in pairs.
# hypotension: On the morning of [**4-11**] she dropped her BPs requiring requiring starting levo and boluses of several liters of fluids.
She remained afebrile but had an increasing white count.
There was concern for infection/abx failure/poor abx absorption in setting of gastric outlet obstruciton.
In light of the duodenal obstruction found on ERCP her failure of her home antibiotics were likely due to poor absorption continued on vancomycin/zosyn/fluconazole until decision for [**Date Range 3225**] confirmed  .
Duodenal Stricture: Pt had gastric distention secondary to duodenal stricture.
Patient's CT had massive gastric distention.
It was unclear what the etiology of the stricture is, whether related to malignancy or benign process.
Patient's CT torso is negative for mass or mass effect.
Prior EGDs have noted duodenal stricture, so this was not a new process, but perhaps a pre-existing lesion that became clinically significant.
Cholangiocarcinoma: Patient with unresectable disease at time of diagnosis, s/p 5-FU and radiation.
Patient without known recurrence of disease to date although constellation of symptoms above concerning for potential disease recurrence (vs. all attributable to infectious sequelae).
