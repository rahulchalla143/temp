# anemia: The patient initially presented with new crit drop in the setting of chemotherapy about three weeks ago.
Of note, he was noted to have guaic positive stools.
Specifically, in the setting of a recent fall and having a supratherapeutic INR, more likely that there was some bleeding into his L thigh, especially given the overlying area of ecchymosis.
An ultrasound was done that showed evidence of small hematoma.
Likely that he was symptomatic from his anemia.
# L knee effusion: The patient was found to have L knee effusion on plain film, likely in the setting of recent fall.
# CAD s/p BMS: The patient has history of CAD s/p BMS in [**2113**], being maintained on ASA/Plavix.
# atrial fibrillation: The patient has a CHADS of 2.
# supratherapeutic INR: The patient was to found to have an INR of 11.8 on admission.
This was likely in the setting of decreased PO intake in recent days due to his chemotherapy.
peripheral nerve sheath tumor:  The patient was incidentally found to have a hypoechoic lesion on his R knee.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR on [**2118-6-6**] and please send results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]  Address: [**Street Address(2) 80228**], [**Location (un) **],[**Numeric Identifier 80229**] Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 80227**] Fax: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 80230**]   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: primary diagnosis: anemia lung cancer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital because you were weak and you were found to have a very low blood count and a very high INR.
