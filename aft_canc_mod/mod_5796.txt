pt has had difficulty ambulating, endorses pain with any movements at all.
She presented to the ED for evaluation of L hip pain.
Past Medical History: Left renal tumor x2, status post CyberKnife radioablation in [**2162-5-23**].

Family History: Not contributory  Physical Exam: Gen: lying in bed, non-toxic, well-appearing HEENT: dry MMM Neck: supple, JVD 8 cm, no carotid bruits Chest: CTAB, no wheezes, decreased BS L base CVS: rrr, Grade II/VI syst murmur LUSB Abd: soft, + BS, minimal tenderness LLQ, no rebound or guarding,  no masses Extrem: no c/c; 2+ pitting edema b/l Neuro: nonfocal, moves all extremities  Pertinent Results: [**2163-1-13**] UCx: PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA.
Low-lying new central venous catheter, which should be partially withdrawn; no definite pneumothorax.
CHF with bilateral pleural effusions.
Hip films (WET READ): No cortical irregularity or disruption of trabecular lines detected to suggest acute fracture in the left hip.
No hip dislocation.
Given osteopenia, dedicated left hip views vs CT/MRI may be considered if indicated to evaluate subtle fractures.
Two left-sided renal lesions are again identified.
Overall, the size of these lesions is slightly decreased in size since the aforementioned recent prior MRI.
Arterial spin labeling sequence does demonstrate blood flow within these lesions as noted.
However, no prior ASL is available for comparison.
Stable large, cystic lesion within the left adnexa as noted above.
No hydronephrosis or stones in the left kidney.
ECHO [**2162-8-31**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.7cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**11-24**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**11-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No evidence of loculated pleural effusion or empyema, though evaluation is limited without intravenous contrast.
New opacification at the right lung base, and posterior segment of the right upper lobe, concerning for pneumonia, possibly related to aspiration.
Unchanged appearance of nonspecific focally distended loops of small bowel.
No specific evidence of bowel obstruction.
Unchanged appearance of numerous calcified lesions throughout the peritoneum and abdomen, limited evaluation without intravenous contrast, but suspicious for metastatic foci.
Unchanged appearance of predominantly cystic left adnexal mass.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 y/o F with PMHx of severe AS & CHF admitted with urosepsis, s/p extubation on [**2163-1-23**], had recurrent A.fib with RVR & hypotension that responded to repeat IV fluid boluses, made DNR/DNI on [**1-27**] with continued delirium.
# A.Fib/CV: Pt with severe AS & CHF with EF 50%.
Pt developped Afib with RVR c/b hypotension that responded to repeated IVF boluses.
Per family meeting, pt was made DNR/DNI, no lines, no pressors.
Pt had intermittent episodes of hypotension requiring further fluid boluses.
Avoiding aggressive volume boluses due to tenous volume status.
#UTI/Septic Shock: Pt recently completed a 10 day course of Zosyn for pseudomonas urosepsis, successfully extubated on [**1-23**].
However, pt developed recurrent hypotension likely cardiogenic etiology but was restarted on empiric ABx prior to leaving the ICU (Zosyn/Vancomycin).
Upon arrival to the floor, the patient remained afebrile with WBC trending down.
# RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE on chronic: Pt initially with oliguric renal failure likely [**12-25**] hypoperfusion vs ATN in setting of shock.
Pt began to naturally diurese on [**2163-1-26**], then UOP dropped in setting of hypotension on [**1-27**].
Currently, avoiding volume overload with gentle IVF boluses.
Urine output decreased and urine studies consistent with pre-renal picture.
Patient given intermittent IVF given poor PO intake.
# RESP FAILURE: Pt was intubated on [**1-18**] due to worsening acidosis & MS changes.
CXR with bilateral pleural effusions R>L & pulm edema.
CT on [**1-18**] showed possible airspace disease in RLL vs chronic changes [**12-25**] to right sided pleurodeisis.
# MS CHANGES: Pt with delirium likely secondary to intubation, polypharmacy & prolonged ICU stay.
Initially received Dilaudid in the ICU, however that was stopped due to worry for hypotension and clouding mental status.
#Thrombocytopenia ??????
#Sacral Decub/intertriguinous rash - was seen by the wound care nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7219**] implemented for wound care.
Code status: DNR/DNI, no lines, no pressors .
On [**1-31**], patient rapidly became hypotensive and unresponsive and expired.
