Admission Date:  [**2122-4-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-4-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2082-7-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Amoxicillin / Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Bactrim / Iodine; Iodine Containing / Abciximab  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**] Chief Complaint: STEMI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 39F with AML s/p [**First Name3 (LF) 3242**] complicated by GVHD, h/o CAD s/p DES to LAD and BMS to D1 in [**11-16**], who awoke from sleep with acute onset of SSCP.
She had profuse diaphoresis, mild nausea, some SOB, but no radiation, no V/F/C/cough/syncope.
Inferior ST elevations were noted on EKG.
She was taken emergently to the cath lab where severe diffuse narrowing and thrombus was seen in the LCx.
Chronic left upper extremity brachiocephalic DVT, bilateral PEs, and femoral vein DVT.
Ankle fracture in left ankle s/p surgical repair [**8-17**] 6.
Asthma 7.
HTN 10.
Type 2 DM - ?
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
There was no thyromegaly.
The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Anterior and lateral lung exam revealed mild expiratory wheezing at the left lung base.
There were no thrills, lifts or palpable S3 or S4.
There were no rubs, murmurs, clicks or gallops.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, and mildly distended.
The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis, or clubbing.
There was [**3-15**]+ bilateral lower extremity edema.
There were no abdominal, femoral or carotid bruits.
Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue revealed subcutaneous induration from Lovenox injections.
Inferior STEMI 2.
Elevated left and right sided filling pressures.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to dyskinesis of the inferior free wall and posterior wall, and severe hypokinesis of the inferior septum and lateral wall.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Coronary angiography of this left dominant system revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.
The left main coronary artery demonstrated mild plaquing.
The LCX had a hazy filling defect with 50% stenosis in the proximal stent and multiple filling defects in the AV groove stent.
However hypercoagulable state complicated the procedure with recurrentpatent stent sites in the proximal and distal LCX with a possible cut off of the distal LPL secondary to embolization.
Iatrogenic AV fistula at left groin access site secondary to repeated attempts for arterial and venous puncture.
Hypotension secondary to possible anaphlactiod reaction to abciximab vs. bleeding at left groin access site.
Brief Hospital Course: 39F w/ h/o AML s/p [**Month/Day/Year 3242**] complicated by GVHD, h/o CAD s/p STEMI and PCI to LAD and D1 in [**11-16**], presents with STEMI and found to have LCX disease in setting of subtherapeutic INR.
## STEMI/Cardiac Ischemia: Pt's STEMI ([**2122-4-9**]) felt to be multifactorial in etiology including likely thrombus from subtherapeutic INR, possible contribution of prothrombotic state.
On day of planned discharge ([**2122-4-13**]), patient developed sudden substernal chest pain, STEMI in infero-posterior distribution.
She returned to NSR without medication/intervention and was taken down to cath.
In cath lab, it was noted that she had in-stent thrombosis in LCx with copious clot which reformed almost immediately after removal.
## Chronic DVTs/PE: Patient has history of poorly controlled INR on coumadin.
Post-cath, she remained hemodynamically stable, but still required an additional 3U PRBC's over the next 3 days to maintain HCT >28.
## AV Fistula: After cath on [**2122-4-12**], U/S with evidence of small left AV fistula.
Repeat U/S 48 hrs later revealed no fistula.
## leukocytosis: Felt to be [**2-13**] resolving C. diff versus stress reaction from STEMI.
She remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
Stool negative for C. diff.
UCx grew GNR and speciation was E. coli sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
This issue was deffered for outpatient.
2) Heme: Pt instructed to f/u with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] regarding heme work-up, further immunosuppressant therapy, and long-term anticoagulation with Lovenox .
ST segment elevation myocardial infarction 2. urinary tract infection 3. cardiac ischemia s/p stent placement 4.
Thrombocytopenia 5.
Graft versus Host disease 6.
Dyslipidemia 7.
Hypertension .
Chronic left upper extremity brachiocephalic DVT, on coumadin with labile INRs 4. h/o recurrent C. diff 5. asthma 6. eczema 7. migraine headaches 8. diabetes - steroid induced   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Chest pain free.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you had a heart attack.
Then, you had another heart attack in the same area of the heart.
You may have an underlying predisposition to clot, which is not clearly elucidated at this time.
You should call your doctor or return to the ER if you have any of the following symptoms: fever > 101.4, chest pain, shortness of breath, numbness or tingling, weakness, dizziness, intractable nausea/vomiting or any other concerning symptoms.
