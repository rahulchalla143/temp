Admission Date:  [**2184-9-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2184-9-15**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: arterial line Pacemaker Placement  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 88yo F with history of follicular lymphoma (treated by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis and history of CVA in [**2179**] who started cycle 4 of of R-CVP chemo yesterday.
This was uneventful and she denied fevers, chills, sweats, diarrhea and emesis.
She developed shortness of breath and substernal chest pressure this morning after awakening and having a bowel movement at 4:30am.
The chest pain did not radiate to the neck/arms/back, not pleuritic, no nausea/vomiting/diarrhea or epigastric pain.
She did not cough or have a fever and denies any sick contacts.
There was no unilateral leg swelling or pain.
By the time EMS arrived, she reported resolution of her symptoms except continued weakness.
Patient was given a full dose of aspirin and later developed hypotension to SBP 80s, but developed no new symptoms.
She received 1500 cc of IVF through two large bore peripheral IVs and was placed on neo for pressure support.
She had a CXR which showed persistent small right pleural effusion with right lower lobe atelectasis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
CTA did not show any evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Initial EKG was sinus and unremarkable but a second EKG in setting of hypotension showed atrial flutter/fibrillation with a stable rate.
No ST changes.
Past Medical History: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] and her family report that since [**Month (only) 547**] of this year, she has had a slow decline in her activity and functioning.
She usually walks with a walker with curvature of the spine, but this has become more and more difficult.
She also has had decreased appetite with weight loss, night sweats, cough, and increasing fatigue.
She noted no fevers or shaking chills, and over the past one to two weeks prior to admission to [**Hospital1 31548**], her family also noted some changes in mental status.
Her family also reports that since she broke her wrist in [**8-/2183**], she has had a overall slow decline as well, as she needed more help with activities of daily living and this had prevented her from being more independent.
Because of her increased lethargy and decreased appetite and intake along with night sweats, she did follow up with her primary care provider.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] work at that time showed pancytopenia, and a chest x-ray done on [**2184-6-9**] showed a new large right pleural effusion.
CTA of the chest on [**2184-6-10**] revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolism with a confirmation of the large right pleural effusion.
There was also note of subcarinal and paratracheal adenopathy.
CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis on [**2184-6-11**] revealed a large mesenteric soft tissue mass and right paraaortic and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy as well as inguinal lymphadenopathy.
The paraaortic lymph nodes measure up to 7.1 cm x 3.9 cm and the mesenteric soft tissue mass measures 7.6 x 3.2 cm.
Note is made of atherosclerotic disease of the aorta with a 4.9 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, as well as a right common iliac artery aneurysm with focal dissection.
There are also multiple hypodense lesions within the spleen which were nonspecific.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] then underwent a thoracentesis on [**2184-6-12**] with removal of 1.5 liters of fluid from the right lung.
This revealed a follicular lymphoma, grade IIIA.
CVA in [**2179**] with left-sided weakness.
Although this improved, she used a cane for ambulation for a while, but has moved more to a walker due to increasing weakness.
Aortic stenosis.
Osteoporosis with osteoarthritis.
Venous stasis, status post varicose vein surgery.
Wrist fracture in 9/[**2182**].
Thrombocytopenia since [**2174**].
Anemia since [**2179**].
Leukopenia since [**77**]/[**2183**].
Her husband died 20 years ago of a heart attack.

The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Critical aortic stenosis.
Mild mitral and aortic regurgitation.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global left ventricular systolic function.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Diffuse smooth septal thickening is most consistent with hydrostatic edema in the setting of effusions and anarsarca.
Enlarging moderately large right pleural effusion and new small left pleural effusion.
Persistent right pleural effusion, unchanged in size with increased associated right lower lobe atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 88 year old female with history of follicular lymphoma, atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis and history of CVA in [**2179**] who started cycle 4 of R-CVP chemo 20 hours before presenting to ED with SOB and substernal CP after a bowel movement.
She was admitted to the ICU on a phenylephrine drip for hypotension that developed in the ED.
# Hypotension: This may be cardiogenic, or secondary to volume depletion or infection.
CXR is not typical of left ventricular failure, but the patient's fluctuating heart rate with pauses may be leading to drops in cardiac output.
The elevated BNP is of little use in the context of chronic aortic stenosis.
Since then her pauses have been much less frequent and her BP more stable.
UA was suggestive of UTI so pt was started on Ciprofloxacin PO 500 mg [**Hospital1 **], urine cx showed E. coli so 3 day course of abx was completed.
# Arrhythmia: Pauses in Heart rate and Afib - likely due to sick sinus syndrome that is not new.
Her sick sinus syndrome and poor volume status together may have dropped her cardiac output leading to SOB and low BP while in ICU.
The pacer was interrogated on [**9-14**] without incidence.
Of note, a hematoma formed on the pt's chest after PPM placement, likely [**1-13**] her thrombocytopenia after chemo.
Of note, the pt's risk of stroke from Afib is quite high given her h/o stroke.
# Episode of Chest pain: [**Month (only) 116**] represent an episode of unstable angina in a pt with a strong family history of CAD, but more likely caused by decreased cardiac output secondary to the patient's sick sinus syndrome and hypovolemia.
Chest pain did not return after transfer to the floor.
# Follicular lymphoma: She just received a dose of R-CVP chemo prior to admission and was continued on her scheduled prednisone and zofran.
She was not neutropenic after her chemotherapy, but in the setting of her sick sinus syndrome and need for pacemaker placement, she was placed on neupogen in order to increase her counts and lower her infection risk.
Multiple causes are possible, although most likely is a combination of chemotherapy (nadir when Hct was 22-23) as well as slight [**First Name (STitle) **] loss from the PPM placement and the hematoma.
# Persistent right pleural effusion and smaller left pleural effusion.
Most likely secondary to the patient's lymphoma, they are probably not large enough to cause respiratory distress or hemodynamic comprimise.
Did not tap or drain these this admission.
# Seziures s/p CVA: continued home dilantin.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 15967**] Facility - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Sick Sinus Syndrome s/p Pacemaker placement   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with chest pain and low [**Hospital1 **] pressure.
Since the cause of your low [**Hospital1 **] pressure and chest pain was thought to be because of your arrhythmia (abnormal pattern of heart beats), you were transferred to the Cardiology service for a pacemaker to be placed.
