[**2158-6-6**] 6:11 pm Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture       Source: Nasopharyngeal aspirate.
There is some widening of mediastinum, mainly on the right side of the carina suggestive of a loculated pleural effusion.
A small left pleural effusion is stable.
There is some improvement of the right-sided atelectatic changes.
No pneumothorax.
No evidence of cholecystitis or cholelithiasis.
Minimal ascites and small right pleural effusion.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2158-6-10**] There is interval progression of right lower lobe pleural effusion and right lung consolidation highly concerning for interval development of infectious process.
There is also additional involvement of left mid lung opacity, concerning for infectious process as well.
Small bilateral pleural effusions cannot be excluded.
New peribronchiolar nodular opacities are visualized in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe as well as in the non-collapsed portions of the superior segment of the right lower lobe and are suggestive of an infectious process.
Mild interval decrease in dominant loculated right lower hemithorax pleural effusion/empyema as well as the second large paramediastinal right pleural effusion.
Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is stable.
Cardiovascular Report ECG Study Date of [**2158-6-11**]  4:12:26 PM Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Lateral ST-T wave flattening.
No major change from the previous tracing.
There has been interval worsening of consolidation which now involves the right upper lobe and left upper and mid lung.
These findings are concerning for worsening pneumonia with the differential also including hemorrhage or leukemic infiltrates given the patient's history of leukemia.
There is fullness to the mediastinal contours, some of which correlates with a loculated right pleural effusion seen on the CT study dated [**2158-6-10**].
No pneumothorax.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
EKG [**6-23**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Poor R wave progression, probable normal variant.
Low amplitude QRS complexes in the limb leads.
Non-specific lateral ST-T wave changes.
One aberrantly conducted beat versus a ventricular premature beat is seen.

#Neutropenic fever: Patient presented with rhinorrhea developing into sorethroat, [**Last Name (STitle) **] and fever.
He was continued on voriconazole for history of disseminated fusarium and linezolid for history of VRE empyema.
Ertapenam was changed to Cefepime given history of E. coli bacteremia in order to broaden for possible Pseudomonas.
A respiratory culture was done and the patient was found to be positive for parainfluenza.
A CT was done on [**2158-6-10**] which showed new peribronchiolar opacity in right upper and right lower lobe compatible with [**Date Range 2**].
The patient was supported with albuterol nebulizers and ipratropium for obstructive lung disease along with [**Month/Year (2) **] suppressants.
Pt was switched to xopenex from albuterol nebs due to tachycardia.
His IV antibiotics were taken off and he remained afebrile for several days prior to discharge.
Chronic issues: # Atrial fibrillation: History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Rate control has previously been difficult with hypotension on beta blockade.

# Hepatitis B: Patient has known hepatitis B and was continued on Lamivudine 100mg po daily.
He is DNR/DNI but does want antibiotics, [**State **] products, and admission if he becomes ill.  Pt does not want additional ICU admissions or Bipap.
