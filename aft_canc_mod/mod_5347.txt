1.8 x 2.3 cm enhancing mass with probable central necrotic component and a mild amount of surrounding edema with evidence of restricted diffusion located in the region of the posterior midbrain.
Likely extraxial, but unable to loaclize with certainity.
The differential diagnosis includes lymphoma or metastatic lesion in this patient with known breast cancer.
A meningioma is also possible, but less likely as no dural tail is identified.

Likely extraxial, but unable to loaclize with certainity.
The differential diagnosis includes lymphoma or metastatic lesion in this patient with known breast cancer.
A meningioma is also possible, but less likely as no dural tail is identified.
No significant interval change in appearance of hydrocephalus with stable position to ventricular drain.
