Admission Date:  [**2132-10-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2132-11-1**]  Date of Birth:   [**2063-2-3**]       Sex:  M  Service:   Thoracic Surgery  HISTORY:  Patient is a 69 year old male with metastatic colon cancer, diagnosed two years ago, who was transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.
Patient has undergone a colon resection with removal of the primary tumor and has since received chemotherapy.
Consequently, patient developed radiation esophagitis and sinusitis and has symptoms of fevers, coughing, and pain in the right chest.
Levaquin with partial resolution of these symptoms.
Patient was undergoing MRI of the spine and was found to have a right-sided pneumonia incidentally.
Patient continued on his antibiotic treatment with Levaquin and a follow-up chest x-ray subsequently showed a right-sided effusion which was confirmed on a follow-up CAT scan.
Patient reports occasional chills, occasional shortness of breath, but denies any chest pain.
Patient admits to hemoptysis and reports a significant weight loss.
MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for metastatic colon cancer as per above.
Consequent radiation esophagitis and sinusitis and suspected right post-obstructive pneumonia.
Patient also had a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2127**].
Patient also has a history of hypertension.
ALLERGIES:  PATIENT DENIES ANY ALLERGIES TO MEDICATIONS.
There is no history of lung cancer in the family.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Patient was afebrile at 98.7, heart rate of 98, blood pressure 142/80, and respiratory rate of 18, and satting 95 percent on room air.
There were no lymph nodes still palpable in the neck.
RESPIRATORY:  Shows decreased breath sounds on the right lower one-half of the lungs with dullness to percussion as well.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, no murmurs appreciated.
There is a well healed scar from the colon resection.
EXTREMITIES;  No clubbing, edema, or cyanosis.
NEUROLOGIC:  Shows grossly intact cranial nerves II-XII and no gross motor or sensory deficits.
Patient underwent a CT scan of the chest on admission which showed a large right hydropneumothorax with gas, atelectasis in the right lower lobe with multiple pulmonary nodules bilaterally.
These findings were most consistent with metastatic disease.
Patient was also noted to have liver metastases and metastatic foci in the thorax at the spine.
Patient also underwent a rigid bronchoscopy with near total removal of endobronchial tumor obstructing the right lower lobe.
It should be noted that a full, complete removal of the endobronchial lesion obstructing the right lower lobe could not be achieved secondary to bleeding in the areas that were resected and made free of the endobronchial tumor.
Patient still had portions of the endobronchial tumor of the right lower lobe and a bronchopulmonary fistula was also noted.
Patient was noted to have air leak in the right-sided chest tube and given the findings in the bronchoscopy done on [**2132-10-23**] the air leak was expected.
Patient was noted to have positive I's and O's since his transfer out of the CSRU and given the interventions that he had gone through patient was further diuresed with IV Lasix.
By postoperative day seven patient's air leak has decreased and patient was given a trial of Water-seal with a follow-up chest x-ray, PA and lateral.
Despite the persistent air leak patient's right lung stayed relatively inflated and one chest tube out of a total of three was carefully taken out on postoperative day nine.
The new chest tube was converted to a empyema tube by attachment of a Heimlich valve and a leg drainage bag.
Metastatic colorectal cancer with endobronchial metastasis.
