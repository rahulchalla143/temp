male who presented  [**2147-6-12**] with episodic facial flushing without diarrhea.
In [**11-16**] a CT of the abd/pelvis was done revealing a left hepatic lobe 5.2x5.2cm lesion and a right anterior lobe lesion measuring 3.7x 2.8cm.
There was fatty infiltration of the liver.
An MRI revealed 3.5cm lesion in the dome of the right lobe, a 2.1cm lesion in the anterior segment of the right lobe and a 3rd 4.1cm lesion more caudad to the 2.1 cm lesion.
A 2.4cm soft tissue mass was noted in the right midline.
A 5cm lesion was noted in the left lateral segment.
An arterial scan revealed five sites of abnormal tracer uptake in the liver.
He was referred to Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] who felt that this was most likely a small bowel carcinoid with mesenteric lymph node metastasis and multiple liver mets.
In [**2148-1-12**] a triphasic CT demonstrated multiple liver lesions.
Right portal vein embolization was done in preparation for right hepatic lobectomy.
Repeat CT demonstrated significant hypertrophy of the left lobe.

INDICATION: Guidance for trisegmentectomy of the liver and for localization of mesenteric mass.
Two separate intraoperative studies were performed initially, intraoperative ultrasound guidance was provided to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to document location of masses in both the left and right lobes of the liver.
In particular, the proximity of the mass in the left lobe to the left portal and hepatic vein was demonstrated.
Several small hypoechoic lesions were also shown to be present in the superficial regions of segment IV-A.
Following initial resection of all of the liver lesions, intraoperative ultrasound guidance was used which demonstrated an initial small lesion in the superficial portion of segment II.
In addition, ultrasound was also used in the midline to document the presence of hypoechoic lymph nodes in the mesenteric mass from regional metastases.
IMPRESSION: Intraoperative guidance provided to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to localize multiple masses in left and right lobes of liver and to document the proximity of mesenteric lymph nodes to the superior mesenteric artery.

Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 70166**]  Service:  HEPATOBILIARY SURGERY   Date:  [**2148-4-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2087-10-4**]        Sex:  M  Surgeon:  [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], MD, PHD 2366  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Carcinoid syndrome, small bowel carcinoid, liver metastases.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Carcinoid syndrome, small bowel carcinoid, liver metastases.
NAME OF OPERATION:  Right hepatic lobectomy, resection of cystic duct mucocele, resection of segment IVB mass, resection of umbilical fissure segment IVB mass, segment IVB mass #2 resection, caudate lobe resection, resection of segment III mass, small bowel resection, intraoperative ultrasound and resection of left lateral segment mass, incisional hernia repair.
PREOPERATIVE STATUS AND DIAGNOSIS:  The patient is a 60-year- old male who presented with episodic facial flushing without diarrhea.
A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis on [**2147-11-22**] demonstrated 2 rounded hypodense lesions in the left lobe of the liver, 1 measuring 5.2 x 5.2 cm, and the second in the right lobe measuring 3.7 x 2.8 cm.
There was no evidence of small bowel lesions or lymphadenopathy.
An MRI on [**2147-12-2**] demonstrated a 3.5 cm lesion in the dome of the right lobe, a 2.1 cm lesion in the anterior segment of the right lobe, and a third 4.1 cm lesion more caudad to the 2.1 cm lesion.
There was also a 2.4 cm mass in the mesentery to the right of midline and a 5 cm lesion in the left lateral segment.
On review of the scans, it was apparent that he was going to require a right lobectomy or possibly trisegmentectomy with resection of the large lesion in the left lateral segment in order to render his liver free of disease.
Therefore, we proceeded with right portal vein embolization which was initially unsuccessful because of recanalization of the portal vein.
However, re-embolization was successful with permanent thrombosis of the right portal vein and significant hypertrophy of the left lobe of the liver.
OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  At the time of exploration, he was found to have a large mucocele of the cystic duct with 2 large stones in the cystic duct remnant.
In addition, he did have a replaced right hepatic artery arising from the superior mesenteric artery and an accessory left hepatic artery arising from the left gastric artery.
He had a known large lesion in the left lateral segment that was able to be enucleated.
He had a second lesion anteriorly in the left lateral segment found by intraoperative ultrasound.
He had multiple lesions in the right lobe.
He also had a lesion in segment IVB near the edge of the liver, a lesion in segment IVB near the umbilical fissure, and lesions in the caudate lobe.
The small bowel mass was found in the distal ileum.
This was a solitary 2 cm lesion with puckering of the small bowel serosal surface.
There was extensive lymphadenopathy at the root of the mesentery that completely encircled and encased the superior mesenteric artery and vein.
A bilateral subcostal skin incision was made and carried down through the subcutaneous tissue.
The anterior rectus sheath, rectus muscle, posterior rectus sheath and the peritoneum were incised.
There had been significant hypertrophy of the left lobe of the liver which was rounded, globular and not easily mobile.
We were able to identify a large cystic mass with [**Doctor Last Name **] hard stones that was in continuity with the common bile duct.
The cystic duct remnant was identified and followed from the common duct into the gallbladder fossa.
The right portal vein was identified and circumferentially isolated and looped with a vessel loop.
Because of the extensive adhesions prior, it was not easy to identify the right hepatic duct at this stage, and this was left for the time when we transected the liver.
Small hepatic veins entering the vena cava were identified, doubly ligated and divided.
The right hepatic duct was identified as we were transecting the liver, and this was doubly ligated with 2-0 silk ties.
It was not removed in continuity because of the difficulty mobilizing the caudate lobe because of the presence of the accessory left hepatic artery and because of the large globular configuration of the left lobe due to the portal vein embolization.
There was a lesion along the inferior aspect of segment IVB that was resected with a wide- margin using the harmonic scalpel.
A second mass in segment IVB near the umbilical fissure was also identified and resected using the harmonic scalpel.
There was another segment IVB mass more cephalad that was also resected.
We next turned our attention to the large mass in the left lateral segment.
There was another left lateral segment nodule in the inferior surface that was identified by ultrasound, and this was similarly resected.
Our line of resection was carefully selected to remove as many of the mesenteric lymph nodes as possible.
There was extensive lymphadenopathy both anterior, posterior and on both sides of the superior mesenteric artery and vein.
Therefore, we did not feel that we could adequately resect this without endangering the entire small bowel and superior mesenteric artery.
Mesenteric defect was closed using interrupted 3-0 sutures.
It should be noted that he had a small incisional hernia from prior surgery in the midline, and this was identified, isolated and closed using interrupted 0 Prolene sutures.
Subcutaneous tissue was irrigated, and the skin closed using 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular.

He experienced hypotension likely due to hypovolemia.
He complained of some mild sternum pain and EKG along with cardiac enzymes were performed.
His chest pain eventually resolved on its own and did not return.
