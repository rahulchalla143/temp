History of Present Illness: This is an 89 year old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, hypertension and end stage congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days prior to admission.
He hit his head but denied history of loss of consciousness.
Since arrival to the TSICU he has had an MRI which shows a type II odontoind fracture.
He also has had a right forearm xray which revealed distal radial and ulnar styloid fractures which have been casted.
He has required haldol and zyprexa PRN for these symptoms.
He was noted to be tachycardic and received significant doses of PRN metoprolol although telemetry strips appear to show sinus tachycardiac versus MAT.
Of note his lasix has been held since admission and on the day of intubation he received lasix 40 mg IV x 2 without significant increase in his urine output.
He was ultimately intubated for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
He had a non-contrast CT of the test which showed a possible pneumonia versus atelectasis.
He was started on vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for presumed hospital acquired pneumonia given an isolated fever to 102 degrees.
He is now being transferrd to the MICU for management of respiratory failure.
Past Medical History: COPD - has been on inhalers in the past but is not on currently Hypertension Stage III Chronic Kidney Disease (baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6) Polyarticular Gout - on prednisone 2.5 mg daily Congestive Heart Failure (preserved EF, severe aortic regurgitation, moderate mitral regurgitation) Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy Home oxygen requirement (2L) for unclear reasons.

Mild atelectasis at the left lung base.
Ill-defined area of heterogeneous signal identified at the odontoid process, the possibility of chronic degenerative changes and an old unhealed fracture are considerations, however, correlation with a dedicated MRI of the cervical spine with contrast is recommended for further characterization.
Multilevel disc degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine as described in detail above.
There is no evidence of focal or diffuse abnormalities within the cervical spinal cord.
Evaluation for subtle fractures cannot be made on these images.
However, there is gross alignment of the elbow joint as well as of the distal radioulnar joint.
There is again seen innumerable erosions within the carpal bones which appear similar to the prior study of [**2108-9-11**].
No fractures of the distal humeral shaft or of the ulnar and radial shafts are identified.
Pelvis XRAY [**2109-10-31**]: No evidence of trauma.
Subtle atelectasis at the left lung base.
Transitional vertebral body.
EKG: sinus tachycardia with frequent PACs, first degree AV block, no acute ST segment changes, no change from prior dated [**2109-10-31**].
MRI Head ([**2109-11-6**]): No evidence of acute infarct.
Moderate-to-severe changes of small vessel disease and moderate brain atrophy.
Right Hand ([**2109-11-7**]): There are innumerable erosions consistent with the history of gouty arthritis, little changed from [**2108-9-11**].
Left Wrist ([**2109-11-12**]): The left distal radial fracture line is still visible, though there is some small amount of adjacent callus formation.
Overall, the degree of angulation of the fracture fragments is near anatomic, though small impaction persists.
A non-united ulnar styloid fragment is also unchanged.
There is no new fracture or dislocation.
Extensive cystic changes and erosions of multiple carpal bones with is also unchanged.
ABD Xray ([**2109-11-22**]): No signs of perforation or obstruction.
Given patients history of atrial fibrillation.
Medication for benign prostatic hypertrophy should be restarted after patient's delirium resolves.
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ________________________________________________________________ 89M h/o severe COPD, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, hypertension and end stage CHF, originally found down in his living room two days prior to admission, found to have multiple fractires, admitted to MICU with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, now s/p intubation, intermittent desaturations often relieved with sunctioning.
# AMS: Delirium.
Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status but consistently below baseline, with ongoing altered level of sensorium and unclear level of orientation.
During the hospitalization patient was provided olanzapine for agitation followed by soft restraints and mittens.
# ANEMIA: Anemia of Chronic Inflammation and Iron Deficiency (low iron, low TIBC, ferritin normal).
Occult positive stool on [**11-15**], BRBPR [**11-18**] (thought to be related to supratherapeutic INR).
B12, folate, hemolysis labs normal.
No previous signs of active blood loss.
Potassium 5.5, no EKG changes.
# RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient required intubation in MICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Multifactorial etiology including underlying COPD and CO2 retention, possible CAP, +/- fluid overload from IVF and cessation of CHF medications on admission (including lasix and lisinopril).
ABG intially showed well-compensated respiratory acidosis, later with acute decompensation.
PNA: History of aspiration, some evidence of small infiltrates versus atelectasis on his CT chest.
Patient treated with eight day course of Vanc/Zosyn (start date [**11-10**]) for hosptial acquired pneumonia.
On [**11-15**] chest xray concern for aspiration pneumonitis.
Since that time CXR has been stable with segmental atelectasis.
CHF: End-stage diastolic CHF complicated by severe AR and moderate MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 10942**] likely [**1-28**] fluid resuscitation as well as withholding of CHF meds.
Lasix [**Hospital1 **] held (last dose [**11-14**]) due to rising creatinine, dry exam.
Fluctuation in renal function was thought to be secondary to fluctuations in volume status.
Thrombocytosis resolved without intervention.
# Right wrist fracture: s/p reduction and splinting.
No plan for operative intervention.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Respiratory Failure 2.
Type II dens fracture and non-displaced right wrist lunate and distal radius fracture 4.
Congestive Heart Failure 5.
Acute on Chronic Renal Failure 6.
Anemia 8.
COPD 9.
You then developed respiratory failure which required intubation.
Because you had difficulty swallowing with high risk of aspiration a PEG tube was placed so you could receive tube feeds.
After intubation you also developed a delirium that has waxed and waned.
Please call your physician or come to the hospital if you experience any of the following new pains that are not controlled with your usual pain regimen, chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, changes in your vision, weakness or numbess in your extremities, or slurring of your speech.
