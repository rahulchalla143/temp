Admission Date:  [**2171-1-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-1-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2133-2-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Latex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**] Chief Complaint: Left lower quadrant, retroperitoneal bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 37 M with tuberous sclerosis with renal angiolipomas and previous right retroperitoneal bleed treated conservatively transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with two day history of left lower quadrant pain and mild vertigo.
Patient was at his group home on day of admission when he developed left lower quadrant pain and generally "not feeling well."
He was found to have a hematocrit of 19 at the hospital, where he underwent non-contrast CT scan; CT scan showed a significant left retroperitoneal bleed x2 believed to be secondary to a bleeding angiomyolipoma.
Interventional Radiology also evaluated patient and felt any invasive intervention would be potentially too complicated given multiple tumors in that region.
Urology (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt that given patient's past right retroperitoneal bleed which responded well to conservative management, patient should receive blood transfusions and close monitoring.
Patient states he had some nausea on the morning of admission but no emesis.
He denied any SOB, chest pain, leg pain.
His pain has improved after pain medications were administered in the ED.
He developed a fever to 101.2 which defervesced with Tylenol.
Blood cultures were drawn and no infectious etiology or localizing symptoms noted thus far.
It was felt patient's low grade fever may be attributable to his retroperitonal hematoma.
When seen in the MICU shortly prior to transfer, patient was pleasant, in no apparent distress with father at the bedside.
He denies any more abdominal pain and denies shortness of breath, dizzyness, fatigue/lethargy.

Denies rashes or skin changes.
Past Medical History: - Tuberous sclerosis - Chronic renal insufficiency - Angiomyolipomas - Seizure disorder: per mother, no seizures since [**2148**] - Hypertension - Right retroperitoneal bleed: managed conservatively  Social History: No tobacco, EtOH, or drugs.

There is no focal infiltrate or effusion.
CT abdomen: Large left retroperitoneal hematoma likely secondary to bleeding angiomyolipoma of the left kidney.
Contrast-enhanced CT may be performed to assess for active extravasation.
There are also septal T wave changes that are non-specific.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2170-3-29**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
Brief Hospital Course: 37 yo male with tuberous sclerosis and renal angiolipomas, previous right retroperitoneal bleed who presents with new acute onset left retroperitoneal bleed that was treated conservatively.
# Retroperitoneal bleed: Likely secondary to bleeding renal angiomyolipoma as complication of tuberous sclerosis.
Urology/surgery/interventional radiology all followed patient closely during the admission, with plans for interventional radiology procedure first if patient became hemodynamically unstable.
# Fever: Questionable whether related with loss of blood, 4 units of blood products transfused or retroperitoneal blood collection.
Per family, "intervention" was recommended to be used instead only if absolutely necessary.
# Chronic renal failure: Stable during this hospitalization.
# Hypertension: Patient was initially hypotensive secondary to the retroperitoneal hematoma.
