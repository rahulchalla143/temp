For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.
[**2124-3-28**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST - There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or acute large vascular territorial infarction.
Prominence of the ventricles and sulci is suggestive of global volume loss.
There is scattered mucosal thickening throughout the bilateral ethmoidal air cells.
Minimal mucosal thickening is also seen in the right maxillary sinus.
Opacification of scattered posterior right mastoid air cells is noted.
[**2124-3-28**] CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CO - No acute process in the abdomen or pelvis.
Massive splenomegaly.
Extensive colonic diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.
Hyperdense right renal cyst, likely hemorrhagic or proteinaceous however Incompletely characterized.
Coarse pancreatic calcifications, possibly the sequelae of chronic pancreatitis.
Circumferential bladder wall thickening could relate to chronic outlet Obstruction or cystitis.
[**2124-3-28**] CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST - No acute fracture.
[**2124-3-28**] GLENO-HUMERAL SHOULDER -  AP, Grashey and scapular Y views of the left shoulder.
There is no visualized fracture.
Mild degenerative changes noted at the acromioclavicular joint.
Included left lung and ribs are unremarkable.
Brief Hospital Course: # GI bleed: The patient presented with report of copious black stools and emesis.
The differential on admission included gastritis/PUD, variceal bleeding in the setting of possible cirrhosis, [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear.
EGD showed esophagitis and possible [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear.
# Fall: Patient presented having fallen down 15 steps with a feeling of light-headedness preceeding.
The fall was likely due to alcohol intoxication from the [**1-24**] bottle of brandy that patient drank prior to admission, and possibly orthostasis in the setting of GI bleeding and vomiting with diarrhea.
He had back pain on presentation and had a CT-neck that showed no fracture, but chronic degenerative changes.
On exam, patient had no neurologic deficits and had paraspinal neck tenderness with other tenderness radiating to the left shoulder.
He had no tenderness at the midline.
# UTI: pt with no reported urinary symptoms, fevers, but urine culture + klebsiella/enterobacter(sensitive to cipro).
