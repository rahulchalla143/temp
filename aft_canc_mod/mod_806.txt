Admission Date:  [**2152-8-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2152-8-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2112-2-18**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: seizure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 40 year old right handed female pediatrician with past medical history of metastatic breast cancer with known  brain mets who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2152-8-8**] with altered mental status and seizure activity.
Staging showed large ill defined cancer in left breast along with lymphadenopathy.
Biopsy with 2.2 high grade ductal carcinoma with invasion.
Routine follow up scan [**6-1**] with interval increase in brain mets.
Asymptomatic at that time, but over past one month, apparently has had episodes of wavy lines in her vision.
While there, complained of nausea in the waiting room.
Noted to have persistent tonic extension of her left arm per ED staff.
About 30 minutes later, had second seizure with left eye deviation and left face and eye rhythmic twitching.
Head CT with multiple areas of vasogenic edema concerning for mets with minimal mass effect, no midline shift, no signs of herniation, no hemorrhage.
Upon reasssessment 30 minutes later, patient remained unresponsive and flaccid.
No withdrawal to pain.
[**Name (NI) 227**] another 4 mg Ativan and then intubated for depressed mental status and inability to protect airway.
Metastatic breast cancer as above 2.
Reactive airway disease  Social History: Married.
2 small children.
No masses or LAD.
No thyromegaly.
No carotid bruits.
No rebound or guarding.
+Corneal reflex bilaterally.
No abnormal movements,  tremors.
Withdraws and localizes to pain in LUE>RUE.
Internal rotation of bilateral LEs to noxious.
Sensation: Withdraws and localizes to pain in LUE>RUE.
Internal  rotation of bilateral LEs to noxious.
Pertinent Results: wbc 4.3/hct 34.4/plt 186 Na 140/K 3.5/Cl 100/Bicarb 23/BUN 23/Cr 0.8/Gluc 136 U/a neg Tox neg Ca 9.4/Mg 1.9/Phos 4.0  CT head [**2152-8-7**]: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
There are multiple areas of vasogenic edema in the frontal lobes bilaterally, in the occipital lobes bilaterally, and more subtle regions within the parietal lobes and left cerebellum.
These findings in this patient with history of breast cancer are likely consistent with  metastatic disease.
There is local mass effect in the areas of vasogenic edema but no shift of normally midline structures.
There is no hydrocephalus.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are seen within the osseous structures.
IMPRESSION: Multiple foci of vasogenic edema, with a suggestion of soft tissue nodules centered within these areas; these findings are likely consistent with metastatic disease in this patient with known breast cancer.
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, or evidence of impending herniation.
PET scan [**2152-5-31**]: Multiple new hypermetabolic lesions in the bilateral posterior occipital lobes, midline infrathalamic region, and at least three regions in the left cerebellar hemisphere.
Suspicious small focus in the right pedicle of L3, possibly on the left side of L3 body.
Likely benign healing rib  fracture in left anterior second rib.
MRI Scan [**2152-3-28**]: Multiple metastases including left frontal ares, left posterior cerebellar.
EEG - [**2152-8-9**] - preliminary findings show no epileptiform activity, finalized report pending at the time of d/c.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 40 year old right handed woman with past medical history of metastatic breast cancer with known brain mets who presents to [**Hospital1 18**] after having generalized tonic clonic seizure followed by focal seizure of left face.
Necessitated increased doses of Ativan as well intubation for airwary protection.
Now with grimacing and localization on exam so less concern for persistent seizure activity.
CT head with multiple areas of vasogenic edema consistent with mets but no hemorrhage, midline shift, mass effect.
The patient had no further seizure activity in the ICU.
[**8-9**] the patient was extubated without difficulty.
She had an EEG that was found to be negative for subclincal seizures.
Please call your Dr.[**Name (NI) 20348**] office or go to the emergency room if you experience confusion, limb shaking, intractable headache, difficulty walking, increasing weakness, loss of sensation.
