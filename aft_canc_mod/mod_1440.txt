Admission Date:  [**2133-1-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-1-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-6-17**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Compazine / Phenergan / Percocet  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 477**] Chief Complaint: respiratory distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness:  69 yo M w/ locally advanced esophageal ca, copd with baseline 02 req., sever emphysema, htn.
Initially presented on [**2133-1-4**] to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with SOB, productive cough, DOE and chest pain a [**3-1**] days.
A bedside echo showed a new pericardial effusion.
A CTA showed no PE but was significant for a small-mod pericardial effusion as well as some pericardial enhancement, small right-sided pleural effusion, increased mediastinal lymphadenopathy (?mets vs. CHF).
Now he is being transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory distress.
There was only slight re-expansion of the LLL.
No distant metastases.
COPD 3.
History of recurrent gallstone pancreatitis with resultant chronic pancreatitis, status post cholecystectomy.
Hypercholesterolemia 7.
8. h/o pneumonia  Past Surgical History: [**2132-1-4**] Laparoscopic esophagectomy [**2132-1-10**] Right VATS with evacuation of hematoma    Social History: He lives at home with his wife and children.
Physical Exam: VS: Temp: 99.5 BP:112 /64 HR:119 RR:25 O2sat 96 pulsus paradoxis: 8 GEN: mildly tachypneic, but comfortable, high flow mask in place, thirsty HEENT: PERRL, MMM, JVD to ear, no carotid bruit.
Poor air-movement throughout.
CV: regular rhythm, tachycardic, no murmurs or rubs ABD: J -tube in place and dressed.
[**1-12**] VIDEO SWALLOW .
The pharyngeal phase was notable for delayed initiation of swallowing; however, there is normal hyoid excursion and laryngeal elevation after initiation of the swallow.
No penetration or aspiration was seen.
Of note, the patient complained of fullness after swallowing, however, no mass lesion was identified.
Limited fluoroscopic images also demonstrate degenerative changes in the cervical spine.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of penetration or aspiration on swallowing.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: A very small pericardial effusion, without signs of tamponade.
CTA CHEST: There is normal filling of the pulmonary arterial vasculature without evidence of pulmonary embolism.
There is interval increase in the size of the pericardial effusion, now small to moderate.
The patient is status post gastric pull-up for esophageal cancer.
There is mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which appears to have increased in the short interval since [**2132-12-31**].
This is concerning for either infection or may be caused by CHF.
Again noted is severe centrilobular emphysema bilaterally with predominance in the upper lobes.
There is stable left lower lobe atelectasis and effusion.
There is a new small right-sided pleural effusion with associated mild compressive atelectasis.
In addition, there is worsening of bilateral basilar atelectasis.
No axillary lymphadenopathy.
Non-contrast images through the upper abdomen do not demonstrate acute pathology.
BONE WINDOWS: No evidence of suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Note is also made of subtle pericardial enhancement - in conjunction with the FDG avidity of the pericard on the recent PET-CT this raises the possibility of pericarditis.
New small right-sided pleural effusion.
Increased bilateral basilar atelectasis.
Increased mediastinal lymphadenopathy in the short interval since [**2132-12-31**].
While the lymphadenopathy per se is concerning for metastatic disease, the rapid interval change is more likely due to congestive heart failure or may due to infection.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 yo M w/ esophageal CA s/p resection, copd, emphysema, htn, dysphagia w/ [**Hospital 12353**] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name **] to hypoxia,  tachypnea.
His CXR was suggestive of worsening pleural effusion.
Differential for hypoxia is CHF, pulmonary edema, tamponade, pna, copd exacerbation, PE (although neg CTA 2 days ago), pneumothorax.
he remained on facemask overnight and did not develop respiratory distress or hemodynamic instability.
Pericardial effusion thought not to be contributing to resp compromise.
# Pericardial effusion: New moderate pericardial effusion (2cm) without tamponade physiology seen on echo on [**2133-1-5**].
he did not develop any signs of hemodynamic compromise.
It is unclear why he has developed a pericardial effusion.
Differential is idiopathic, malignancy, viral (presents with cough for several days), bacterial, pericarditis (pt presented with CP, some enhancement seen on CTA), hypothyroidism.
Cardiology following and did not believe effusion was large enough to tap for diagnostic testing.
# esophageal ca: Plans for followup with outpatient oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
# pancreatic insufficiency: continued replacement panc enzymes .
# pain control: continued fentanyl patch.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital1 1474**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Aspiration Pneumonia due to dysphagia COPD flare HF, diastolic, acute on chronic Esophageal adenocarcinoma with increasing mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
At baseline oxygen   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a COPD exacerbation and possible lung infection associated with not being able to swallow.
You also have a bit of fluid around your heart and must see a heart doctor to monitor it.
