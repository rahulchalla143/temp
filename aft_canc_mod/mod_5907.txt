There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 89 year old man with gastric outlet syndrome repaired with gastrojejunostomy with increasedd NGT output and recent aspiration REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: contrast through NGT - does it pass anastomosis?
INDICATION: Gastric outlet syndrome with gastrojejunostomy and increased NG tube output.
Focused spot images of the gastrojejunal anastomosis are limited because contrast was not present at the anastomosis at the time of spotting; however, there is no evidence of extravasation of contrast.
IMPRESSION: Evidence of slow gastric emptying through the anastomosis into jejunum after 20 minutes, improved from prior study.
No evidence of contrast extravasation.
