Admission Date:  [**2104-2-5**]       Discharge Date:  [**2104-2-7**]  Date of Birth:   [**2044-6-27**]       Sex:  M  Service:  MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 59 year old male with a history of metastatic Stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung with metastases to the brain and neck who presented to an outside hospital in mid [**2104-1-8**], with right sided chest pain.
CT angiogram was positive for pulmonary embolism and pericardial effusion.
An echocardiogram was positive for tamponade, and the patient underwent pericardiocentesis which showed malignant cells.
An inferior vena cava filter was placed at that time as anticoagulation was contraindicated in this patient with bleeding pericardial effusion.
Follow-up echocardiogram on [**2104-1-23**], showed slight diminution in the pericardial effusion.
On the day of admission, the patient called his oncologist complaining of left leg pain and swelling.
Ultrasound of his lower extremity showed extensive deep vein thrombosis in his left lower extremity.
Cardiology was consulted at that point who felt that anticoagulation was still an extreme risk in this patient with a history of bloody pericardial effusion.
In the Emergency Department, the patient also had intermittent rapid atrial fibrillation up to a rate of 190 which broke spontaneously and the patient converted to normal sinus rhythm, however, he remained tachycardic.
Stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung with metastases to the brain and neck.
Status post pericardial effusion with tamponade, pulmonary embolus as described in history of present illness [**2104-1-8**].
He is anicteric with dry mucous membranes.
His neck is supple with no jugular venous distention, no lymphadenopathy.
His heart is tachycardic with normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
His abdomen has normal bowel sounds, is nontender and nondistended.
Left lower extremity is swollen and hot and diffusely tender with pain on passive motion of the knee and a positive Homans' sign.
There are no palpable cords.
He has decreased sensation in the left lower extremity with decreased motor strength secondary to pain.
Electrocardiogram - sinus tachycardia at 130 beats per minute with normal axis and intervals, 1.
[**Street Address(2) 2811**] depression in V5 and left ventricular hypertrophy, no strain pattern.
Lower extremity noninvasives reveal no flow, compressibility or augmentation of the left common femoral, superficial femoral, saphenous or popliteal veins consistent with extensive deep vein thrombosis.
Chest x-ray - evidence of right upper lobe resection, elevated right hemidiaphragm, no congestive heart failure or consolidations.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an unfortunate 59 year old male with metastatic lung carcinoma with metastases to the brain and neck and history of pulmonary embolus and malignant pericardial effusion and tamponade two weeks prior to admission.
He now presents with left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.
Deep vein thrombosis - By lower extremity noninvasive, the deep vein thrombosis was extensive.
Cardiology service felt that the patient's recent effusion was an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation.
Therefore, the patient was managed supportively with pain relief using M.S.
Contin and MSIR for breakthrough pain, elevation of left lower extremity and oxygen supplementation as needed.
The patient has an inferior vena cava filter, however, there is no absolute certainty that the patient did not also have pulmonary embolus.
Pericardial effusion - A bedside echocardiogram showed a continued moderate effusion, slightly larger than the previous echocardiogram.
Atrial fibrillation - The patient was in sinus tachycardia.
He was briefly in rapid atrial fibrillation secondary perhaps to pulmonary embolus.
Acute renal failure - The patient's creatinine rose to a peak of 3.0.
It was felt that this was secondary to volume depletion from poor p.o.
A renal ultrasound showed no extension of the clot to the renal veins.
There is also no evidence of hydronephrosis or obstruction.
The patient was given fluid boluses for intravascular repletion.
He is to have liberal opiates for pain control.
