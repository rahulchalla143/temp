Name:  [**Known lastname **],[**Known firstname 1355**]                Unit No:   [**Numeric Identifier 1356**]  Admission Date:  [**2121-1-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-2-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2051-3-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Protonix / Aggrenox  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 161**] Addendum: Mrs. [**Known lastname 734**] was not able to be discharged on [**2121-2-4**] because of some complications with her insurance.
Her PO intake trailed off and she developed thrush in her mouth, which made it more difficult for her to swallow.
Deep suctioning was done with some improvement in her symptoms, but the patient was very uncomfortable with the suctioning.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 734**] had been on telemetry earlier in her stay for persistent sinus tachycardia.
Her HR was as high as the 120s and she began to receive IVF (NS at 80cc/hr to prevent flash pulmonary edema) in case dehydration/hypovolemia was the cause of her tachycardia.
Her thrush was abundant and caused her to have a hoarse voice and to be unable to swallow her pills.
Her exam was notable for a sinus tachycardia w/ rate in the 120s.
Lungs were clear, with no evidence of volume overload, and she had no JVD or peripheral edema.
EKG revealed atrial fibrillation/flutter.
Pain and Palliative Care saw the patient, as did social work, and helped support the family in making the transition to hospice care.
Based on some nonspecific ST changes on her EKGs, she had cardiac enzymes cycled x3 which were negative.
The second leading concern was for an infection, particulary when she began to develop a leukocytosis.
She had a CXR which was more consistent with volume overload.
The decision was made not to attempt transfer to a hospice facility as she was likely too fragile for transfer.
She went into rapid atrial fibrillation again and she and her family decided on no further interventions, including medications for rate control.
She was given oxygen and morphine for respiratory distress and ativan for seizure activity.
