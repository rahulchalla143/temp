Admission Date:  [**2151-5-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-5-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2084-10-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**] Chief Complaint: s/p PVI for refractory atrial fibrillation with hypotension and bradycardia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pulmonary vein isolation for atrial fibrillation ([**2151-5-11**])   History of Present Illness: 66 year old male with hx of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation since [**2148**] s/p numerous failed chemical and electrical cardioversions presents with fatigue.
He presented for PVI today and was found to be bradycardic to 40s-50s with junctional escape beats and hypotensive to SBPs 80-90s in the PACU, requiring dopamine.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: + Dyslipidemia, + Hypertension 2.
- Prostate cancer s/p brachytherapy ([**2143-8-16**]) - ?
Sleep apnea (has not had sleep study yet) - Kidney stone - Resection of basal skin cancers - Appendectomy   Social History: Patient is married with three children.
-Tobacco: Denies -ETOH: 2 drinks per day  Family History: Father with heart disease and siblings with atrial fibrillation.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
NECK: Supple with no JVD.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB over anterior and lateral lung fields (cannot lean forward [**2-17**] femoral cath sites), no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominal bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
After cardioversion his sinus rate was slow (30-40) with junctional escape rhythm associated with hypotension.
ACTIVE ISSUES .
# Hypotension s/p PVI: After PVI procedure, patient became bradycardic and hypotensive in the PACU, requiring pressor support with dopamine.
This hypotension may have been secondary to the anesthesia medications, which may needed time to wear off, or related to the bradycardia [**2-17**] to the procedure itself.
# RHYTHM / bradycardia s/p PVI for atrial fibrillation: The patient had bradycardia to the 50s-60s, with some junctional escapes.
Bradycardia is not a common occurrence s/p PVI, as we are generally more concerned about more mechanical consequences such as tamponade or pulmonary vein stenosis, rather than electrical disturbances that may cause a bradyarrythmia.
# PUMP: Mildly depressed EF of 50% on recent cardiac MR (done prior to PVI).
He has been on a statin for control of his hyperlipidemia and was continued on this during his hospitalization.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES .
You were admitted for pulmonary vein isolation for your atrial fibrillation.
