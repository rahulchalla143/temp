He refers that in [**Month (only) **] he started having increase urinary frequency.
After the [**9-1**], he started having dry cough, night sweats, fevers and general malaise.
No pariticular pattern of his fevers.
Low appetite as well.
No abdominal sympotms.
After 3 weeks of this sympotms he developed more urinary sympotms, burning on urination, bilateral frank pain.
He felt that his urinary symptoms had came back.
He continue to have persistent urinary symptoms, malaise and fatigue.
He was seen on [**9-3**], (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 24934**] who felt that his prostate was enlarged and tender.
His CT revealed cystic strucuture in the lower portion of left kidney and also numerous periaortic, celiac and pelvic lymph node.
Over the next week, he developed Right upper quadrant abdominal pain, constant, and also over his right chest wall.
A week prior to admission he developed increasing shortness of breath specially on exertion, extreme fatigue, palpitations, nausea and vomit.
+ petechial lesion over extremities and abdomen.
CT Abdomen was done that showed new pockets of ascitis, pelvic lymphadenopathy worse thatn prior, cirrhotic liver, enlarged portoahepatis and portocaval notes and heterogeneus prostate.
A CTA was done that was negative for PE - altough states that a suboptima IV bolus was given-.
Subpleural node 2.9 mm RML noted, 3mm focal opacity along RM fisure.
His labs were notable for WBC 5.6, HCT 41.6 Platelets of [**Numeric Identifier 961**], INR 1.0, PTT 25.8, elevated bili 2.63 Direct 1.66, and elevated transaminases ALT 225, AST 184, alk phosphatase 165LDH 2163.normal Creatinine 1.0 Peripheral smear was reviewed with no evidence of schistocytes.
Bone marrow biopsy performed on Friday showed findings consistent with neuroendocrine tumor.
Surgery was consulted for possible biopsy of lymph nodes but felt it was unsafe to do it with thrombocytopenia.
On the evening of [**2114-9-17**], he developed acute respiratory distress.
STAT CXR revealed worsening B/L pleural effusions.
CT chest concerning for new opacities.
ABG revealed hypoxia and he was switched to a NRB and transferred to the MICU for closer respiratory monitoring.
In MICU he was treated with morphine for SOB and continued on zosyn.
Heme/onc recommended initiating chemotherapy and due to his worsening respiratory status with increased oxygen requirement he was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for close monitoring.
He was placed on BiPAP for increased SOB prior to transfer on [**9-19**].
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient was complaining of some mild SOB, however reported that his breathing was better on BIPAP.
He expressed that he was anxious about his new diagnosis and the upcoming chemotherapy.
No ocuppational exposures.
HEENT: NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI without nystagmus, mild icteric sclera Neck: supple, no JVD or carotid bruits appreciated Pulmonary: Decrease breath soudns in the bases.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Extremities: No edema 2+ radial, DP and PT pulses b/l.
Skin: + petechia in lower extremitis and abdomen.
Pertinent Results: CT Abdomen [**2114-9-13**] PELVIS: There is minimal interval enlargement of prominent retroperitoneaL lymph nodes; a representative left parailiac node measures 1.6 cm (image 59  series 2), previously measuring 11 mm.
There is a 3.3 x 2.3 cm lymph node noted along the right external iliac vessels.
In addition, there is a stable 1.8 cm lymph node along the left pelvic side wall.
A 1.2 cm node is seen within the perirectal fat.
The prostate gland is slightly heterogeneous.
PELVIC LYMPHADENOPATHY CONCERNING FOR AN UNDERLYING MALIGNANCY, SPECIFICALLY [**Month (only) **] REFLECT UNDERLYING LYMPHOMA.
LIKELY CIRRHOTIC LIVER.
ENLARGED PORTAHEPATIS AND PORTOCAVAL NODES [**Month (only) **] BE INFLAMMATORY IN NATURE.
CT PE [**2114-7-14**]: negative for PE .
TTE [**2114-9-17**] Small left ventricular cavity with hyperdynamic function, tachycardia, moderate outflow tract gradient and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflet in the absence of left ventricular hypertrophy (suggestive of intravascular volume depletion with high catecholamine state).
No intracardiac shunt identified.
CT Chest [**2114-9-17**] No pulmonary embolism.
Diffuse tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities predominating within the lower lobes bilaterally representing an acute infectious process.
Multiple hypoattenuating lesions diffusely throughout the liver of varying sizes.
While most of the opacities in the lung are tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**], some are morenodular and repeat chest CT may be indicated if further abdominal workup reveals underlying malignancy to rule out lung metastases.
CXR [**2114-9-19**]: No new focal consolidations are identified with increased obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm likely related to underlying atelectasis.
There is persistent left lower lobe linear atelectasis and low lung volumes.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette, contours and pleural surfaces are unchanged.
Preliminary BM biopsy showed evidence of neuroendocrine tumor, complicated by respiratory distress.
The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for initiation of chemotherapy, s/p intubation on [**9-20**] for worsening respiratory distress.
The patient had diffuse LAD and hepatic nodules concerning for metastatic disease.
Chemotherapy was initiated on [**2114-9-20**]; however, due to the patient's rapid clinical decline chemotherapy was felt to be unlikely to produce an effect.
# New onset liver failure/ lactic acidosis: felt to be secondary to metastatic disease.
There was no plan for biopsy given low platelets; however MR of the abdomen showed several diffuse nodules in liver with necrosis - infectious vs lymphoma, less likely HCC.
On [**2114-9-20**] there was a dramatic rise in lactate secondary to liver failure with a steady increase throughout the day from 7 to >18.
# Thrombocytopenia/ Anemia: Most likely [**3-2**] cancer.
Preliminary BM biopsy showed infiltrating carcinoma of bone marrow consistent with neuroendocrine tumor.
Hct progressively declined, as below, but there was no clinical evidence of active bleeding.
# Anemia:  The patient was at risk of bleeding given thrombocytopenia, but did not show any active signs of bleeding.
Hemolysis labs negative.
Anemia was also thought to be related to malignancy and BM process.
# SOB/tachypnea/hypoxia: Etiology was not entirely clear, but most likely related to worsening acidemia and/or lymphangitic spread of his tumor.
Echo with bubble study negative for shunt.
No clinical evidence of volume overload currently with flat JVP.
During the ICU course the patient was intubated on AC for increased work of breathing and increasing O2 requirement.
# Hypotension: The patient became increasingly hypotensive as acidosis worsened and ventilation and sedation were increased.
An arterial line was placed without complication and the patient was started on levophed, which was uptitrated to maximal settings, and vasopressin which produced temporary increases in SBP.
# PEA/ arrest: On the morning of [**9-21**] in the above setting, the patient had an episode of PEA arrest for which he temporarily responded to epinephrine.
His wife, [**Name (NI) **], was contact[**Name (NI) **] with this information, and chose not to rescusitate any further.
# Communication was with [**Name (NI) **] (wife) home [**Telephone/Fax (1) 74072**] cell [**Telephone/Fax (1) 74073**] .
Medications on Admission: Lipitor  Discharge Medications: none  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: neuroendocrine tumor, metastatic liver failure lactic acidosis   Discharge Condition: Expired.
