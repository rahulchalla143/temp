of bleomycin toxicity recently discharged after prolonged hospitalization with MICU stay, [**Month/Day/Year 1065**] pneumonia, complicated by renal failure requiring temporary hemodialysis, who presented with SOB.
He states this feels like an asthma exacerbation.
Was febrile when seen in clinic to 102, 88% on RA, was noted to be wheezing and tachycardic.
Pt became progressively tachypneic and [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] was called to evaluate patient.
He was intubated on arrival without complication  ROS: Denies any recent sick contacts.
Notes mild pleuritic chest pain and nausea.
No emesis, abdominal pain, diarrhea, brbpr, urinary complaints.
- Prior severe pneumonias, including likely prior [**Year (4 digits) 1065**] infection.
- Hypothyroidism - Asthma - HBV core Ab positive - S/p biliary stent  Social History: On disability.
Slight decrease in small left pleural effusion and unchanged small right pleural effusion.
No change in the appearance of the central venous catheter.
No pulmonary edema.
Multifocal pneumonia progressed since [**2103-10-24**] Chest CT, but improved when chest radiographs are reviewed between [**11-2**] and [**11-5**].
Right infrahilar mass decreased in size since [**2103-1-30**], retroperitoneal adenopathy and left adrenal mass decreased since [**2103-10-5**].
Brief Hospital Course: 45 yo M with a long history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p allogeneic transplant with recurrence admitted with fever, hypoxia and new pulmonary infiltrates, intubated given respiratory distress.
RESPIRATORY DISTRESS & ICU COURSE: Transferred to MICU the morning after admission on [**11-3**] and intubated for respiratory distress.
Intubated on presentation to ICU for respiratory distress.
Thought initially to have pneumonia - infiltrates in RUL and RML.
Bronchoscopy demonstrated mild erythema of airways but no visible obstruction.
With lack of success with antibiotics, thought then switched to possibility of fluid overload.
Vigileo showed CO=9.6, CI=5.8, indicating hypervolemia with good cardiac function.
A TTE demonstrated preserved EF with new TR gradient.
HYPOXIA/PNEUMONIA - Hypoxia was thought to be either from a [**Month/Year (2) 1065**] infection that returned following the discontinuation of posaconazol, or from a new bacterial pneumonia.
All diagnostic studies were negative except for some pleural gram stains showing GPC and a positive b-glucan (drawn before IVIG).
A repeat beta-glucan was elevated (> 500), but as this was drawn after IVIG, this was of unclear significance.
He had a low-grade temp to 100 and mild hypotension on [**11-14**] concerning for infection.
Repeat chest CT showed interval improvement.
He remained afebrile with normal pressures off antibiotics.
Mild fevers and hypotension were thought not to be related to infection ** Posaconazole needs to be continued, start date [**2103-11-2**].

Given acute respiratory failure and possible infection, further treatment was delayed.
# DECONDITIONING - His multiple hospitalizations and chronic disease have left him severly deconditioned.
