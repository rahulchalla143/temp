Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion, increased compared to radiographs from [**2173-11-22**], but not significantly changed compared to the outside hospital radiograph from approximately two hours ago.
Moderate right basilar compressive atelectasis.
A concomitant  consolidation at the right base cannot be excluded  CT head [**2174-12-5**] 1.
Bilateral, left greater than right, acute-on-chronic subdural hematomas with significant increase in rightward midline shift as compared to [**2174-1-18**], now 8 mm, with early subfalcine herniation, significant increase in left cerebral sulcal effacement.
Compression of the left frontal and posterior horns.
Possible impending uncal herniation.

On [**2174-2-6**], the patient went to the operating room for a left sided craniotomy for evaculation of subdural hematoma with placement of a subdural drain.
The post operative Head Ct was consistent with expected changes.
On exam, the patient was verbal, she was opening her eyes spontaneously, Left proptosis and upgaze palsy on the left continued and was baseline.
The patient began following commands and would wiggle toes to command and move the right extremity more so than the left but purposfully.Due to low output the subdural drain was removed and the skin was closed with staples.
