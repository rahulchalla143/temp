He was afebrile at that point but started on Keflex for a question of cellulitis.
Two days later he became febrile and weak, and his white blood cell count increased from 20 to 40.
He noted no increase in his left axillary pain or redness.
He noted no cough, no shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain.
He became hypotensive and hypoglycemic, so he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; multiple skin lesions, complications of PUVA treatment, status post resection of many of the lesions.
A left arm cutaneous lesion was removed by wide local excision in [**2148-12-13**] and then he underwent radiation therapy to the area.
It was a moderately to poorly differentiated tumor on histology.
He had a recurrent left axillary lymph node which was partially resected in [**2149-7-13**].
His carboplatin was stopped for an increased creatinine.
He is currently still on the doxorubicin but has been dose adjusted for his renal failure.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
for Port-A-Cath prophylaxis.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  His sister died of lung cancer, and his brother died of a myocardial infarction at age 57.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  This was a pleasant obese man in no apparent distress, who was afebrile with a temperature of 97.2, blood pressure of 72/35 to 90/50, pulse of 55, and a respiratory rate of 20.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with decreased breath sounds at the bases.
His left axilla was warm with a purplish hue to skin and chronic skin changes with surrounding erythema.
There was a firm 5-cm X 5-cm nodular area with a fluctuant portion just anterior.
There was a small break in the skin at the site of his old [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain from his axillary dissection that was weeping with yellow drainage.
His heart was regular in rate and rhythm with no murmurs.
His extremities were without edema and with good distal pulses.
There was no active scoriatic lesions.
He had a brown scabrous lesion on his left shin.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray was negative for acute airspace disease.
Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 100 beats per minute with no acute changes.
A chest CT was  performed which showed left axillary necrotic area with a peripheral enhancing lesion as well as a small right axillary and bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy.
His hydrochlorothiazide, Univasc, and Amaryl were held as he was normoglycemic and normotensive.
She noted that he was not a surgical candidate for further resection but thought that radiologic drainage of his axillary mass could be helpful.
A dedicated axillary CT was performed which showed a mass which central fluid collection with a question of necrotic lymph node core.
This was then drained under ultrasound-guidance of serosanguineous fluid that was culture negative but cytology positive for malignant cells.
Advanced squamous cell carcinoma including a left axillary recurrent tumor.
