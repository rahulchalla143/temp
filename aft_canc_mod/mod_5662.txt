Spanish-speaking male with multiple myeloma, ESRD on HD, history of right PICA CVA, HTN who presents with gradually worsening mental status with agitation, inability to walk and disorientation x 1 week.
Patient was brought in by family for concern of mental status.
Mental status was felt to be due to hypercalcemia, but patient could not get fluids because of concern of fluid overload, suggested by desaturation to high 80s on room air, improved with 3 liters.
CXR was consistent with fluid overload.
Given a low-grade temperature of 100.9 and altered mental status, an LP was considered, but deferred since patient's INR was mildly elevated to 1.9 (anticoagulated because of PAF) and because FFP to reverse it would have added to his fluid burden.

The ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent consistent with involutional changes.
Wedge shaped hypodensity of the right cerebellum is most likely sequale of prior infarct.
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are compatible with chronic microvascular infarction.
The visualized part of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
No fracture is detected.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology including no hemorrhage.
[**2130-6-20**] MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: There is a tiny area of restricted diffusion in the body of the right caudate with correlate on ADC map, consistent with an acute infarct.
Chronic cerebellar and other bilateral lacunar infarcts are seen.
There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass or hydrocephalus.
Periventricular white matter hyperintensities are again seen and compatible with changes of small vessel ischemic disease.
There is no midline shift.
There is no evidence of venous sinus thrombosis.
There is poor flow void identified in the right distal vertebral artery, as before.
Solitary lesion is not typical for embolic phenomenon, but is considered.
Acute ischemic infarction is another consideration.
Stable appearance of chronic cerebellar and a lacunar infarct.
No venous sinus thrombosis.
No evidence for bladder wall injury.
Diverticulosis without evidence for diverticulitis.
[**2130-6-25**] EEG: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the slow and disorganized background and the bursts of generalized slowing.
This abnormality suggests a widespread encephalopathy of both cortical and subcortical structures.
There were no lateralized or epileptiform features seen in this recording.
[**2130-6-28**] RIGHT CLAVICLE: There are no signs for acute fractures or dislocations.
There are no focal lytic or blastic lesions within the right clavicle.
There is AC joint osteoarthritic changes with some spurring consistent with osteoarthritis.
There is a portion of the central venous catheter within the right upper lung field.
Analysis is performed in direct comparison with a preceding similar study of [**2130-6-28**].
Findings of this single plain AP chest examination does not include a new parenchymal infiltrate or pleural effusion that reaches the lateral pleural sinuses.
Previously described [**Year (4 digits) 2286**] line in unchanged position and no evidence of pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of new infiltrates or advanced CHF.
Low calcium bath used for subsequent HD sessions.
Heme/Onc was consulted for evaluation of multiple myeloma as etiology for hypercalcemia, and for definitive management of myeloma.
#Altered mental status - Attributed to hypercalcemia as mental status improved with treatment.
As the likelihood of suspicion for meningoencephalitis or myelomatous CNS involvement were low, and since the patient rapidly improved, LP was deferred.
While non-contrast head MR [**6-20**] (for which the patient was electively intubated and sedated) revealed a tiny lacunar infarct in the body of the right caudate, the consulting neurology team felt that this was most likely not acute and would not likely explain the current clinical picture.
EEG showed some slowing but no signs of seizure activity.
On [**6-29**], pt had recurrence of confusion with concommitant hypoxia to mid-upper 80s on RA and lethargy.
This was thought to be most likely seconary to his rising calcium levels.
Pt did not have leukocytosis or fever.
# Hypoxia- On [**6-29**], pt had recurrence of confusion with concommitant hypoxia to mid-upper 80s on RA and lethargy.
ABG showed a metabolic alkalosis with likely concommitant AG acidosis and non-gap acidosis.
CXR did not show signs of new pneumonia or fluid overload.
#Retained foley fragment - The patient removed his foley catheter with the balloon inflated and abdominal CT [**6-21**] revealed a 3.3 cm segment of retained catheter within the bladder without evidence of bladder wall injury.
Urology surgically removed this fragment under general anaesthesia on [**6-23**] without complication.
Heparin bridge was deferred given the low faily risk of stroke and a history of recurrent GI bleeding.
Aggressive blood pressure control was avoided due to a history of recurrent falls and tendency to become hypotensive after [**Month/Day (1) 2286**].

You will be starting chemotherapy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] next week in an attempt to improve your multiple myeloma and high calcium levels.
5) Tramadol was started for pain 6) Hydralazine also available PRN SBP>160 7) Standing Tylenol was started for pain 8) Oxycodone is available as needed for breakthrough pain 9) Dexamethasone 5-day course was started, last day [**2130-7-2**]  Please weigh yourself daily and call your physician if your weight increases by more than 3 pounds.
