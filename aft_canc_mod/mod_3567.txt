A [**Name (NI) 71316**] wire crossed the lesion with minimal difficulty.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis at the ostium of the D1, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow.
Underlying acute osteomyelitis.
Proximal margin (E):  Bone with foci of reparative change and intra medullary fibrosis with no significant acute inflammation; multiple levels are examined.
Studies: ABIs ([**2114-6-12**]): INDICATIONS:  89-year-old male with dry gangrene of left hallux.
FINDINGS:  Bilateral lower extremity ABIs, Doppler waveforms, and PVRs were performed at rest.
Right-sided PVRs are mildly diminished in the amplitude but at the metatarsal level suggest potential for healing minor tissue loss.
Strong Doppler waveforms with PVRs suggest mild tibial disease on the right and mild, non-occlusive tibial disease on the left.
Heme: FACTOR ASSAYS       Fact [**Doctor First Name 81**]    FacXII FacXIII [**2114-6-14**] 11:10AM    147        114  NORMAL   Brief Hospital Course: 89 yo male with history of CAD s/p LAD stent, IDDM2, and PAD, admitted for gangrenous L foot s/p left hallux amputation complicated by post-op NSTEMI, now s/p cardiac catheterization with BMS to Diag1 transferred to the MICU for hypotension with concern for sepsis.
# Hypotension:  On the 10th day of his hospital stay, he triggered for hypotension with SBP to 70, fever to 102 and a lactate of 2.9.
Most likely septic in origin given fever, leukocytosis, hypotension with elevated lactate.
Potential sources include GU tract, toe, and scrotum however no clear evidence of disease.
Also risk for hypotension with blood loss, Hct trending down.
CT abdomen did not reveal any evidence of acute infection.
A source of infection was never identified and the patient s bp remained stable following transfer from MICU.
# Scrotal pain: He reports month long duration of pain, with acute exacerbation.
No torsion, abcess, or epididymitis on ultrasound.
Urology was consulted who recommended ice and elevation of scrotum.
He was continued on his home MS contin at 30mg [**Hospital1 **] with oxycodone and morphine for breakthrough pain.
He and his family are not entirely sure of the dates or details of his cardiac history.
The morning following his amputation ([**6-15**]), the patient reported significant nausea and chest tightness.
EKG at the time was reassuring with sinus tachycardia with nonspecific and stable lateral ST segment changes.
Cardiac enzymes were monitored and were slightly elevated (peak troponin 0.21, peak CK-MB 5).
Unstable angina s/p cardiac catheterization with BMS placement to diag1.
Currently on aspirin/plavix and chest pain free.
Cath complicated by groin ecchymosis without palpable hematoma.
# Diarrhea: Has loose stool at home, now with continued diarrhea in the setting of multiple abx.
Uncertain etiology but most likely [**1-11**] abx has pt has no WBC or temp.
# Dysuria: Patient complaining of dysuria and increasing frequency following removal of foley on [**6-23**].
UA on [**6-25**] showed pyuria with some bacteria.
# Gangrene/osteomyelitis of left hallux s/p L hallux amputation: He was treated with zosyn x7d upon transfer (he also received doses of vanco and ancef).
Plain films at the OSH revealed evidence of likely osteo and vascular surgery at the OSH felt that it was going to require amputation.
Vascular surgery was consulted who recommended ABIs to ensure appropriate blood flow for future wound healing.
Final result of bone biopsy showed clean tibial margin with gram positive cocci in amputated toe.
The abx were discontinued in setting of clean margins.
# Peripheral vascular disease:  Extensive bilateral tibial disease found on noninvasives.
# Abdominal masses: Patient with firmness with abdominal palpation and recent PE.
New inderminate enhancing soft tissue mass encasing the left renal artery noted on Abd CT on [**2114-4-19**].
Head CT without evidence of mets.
He does NOT have these factor deficiencies.
# HTN: Currently normotensive.
# Anemia: Patient is within baseline anemia (low 30s) with normo-macrocytic MCV.
Likely due to anemia of chronic disease, given CKD.

You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of the infection in your left toe that required amputation.
You also reported that you were having chest pains.
We performed several blood tests and found that you were having a mild heart attack.
