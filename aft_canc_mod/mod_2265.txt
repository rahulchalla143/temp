Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: (Itubation at outside hospital) J-tube placement Nasogastric tube placement   History of Present Illness: The pt is a 78 year-old R handed female w. PMH of a fib, and marginal zone Non-hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma with CNS involvement who presents as a transfer from an OSH for an IPH.
The sister found the patient laying on the floor in a pile of coffee ground emesis with dried blood on her face.
Patient was nonverbal with minimal movement.
Past Medical History: 1) Hypertension 2) Asthma/?COPD (since age 40) 3) Chronic diastolic heart failure 4) Atrial fibrillation (not currently anticoagulated, per pt's request) 5) Moderate pulmonary hypertension 6) Tricuspid regurgitation (3+ per ECHO performed in [**2155**]) 7) CNS lymphoma diagnosed in [**2153**], s/p surgery and chemo, now in remission 8) Vertigo, intermittent, began in [**2159**]   Social History: Lives in her own apartment in Senior Living, has homemaker come clean for her once a week.
Lung with poor expansion, but without evident crackles and reduced transmitted upper airway sounds compared to days prior.
Somatic motor exam significant for proximal UE and LE weakness (mild) and weakness of left arm in a upper motor neuron pattern.
Left arm antigravity and used for some tasks.
[**Year (4 digits) 4459**]: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: Supple Pulmonary: bilateral rales Cardiac: irregularly irregular Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Left lower extremity swelling.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
IX, X: positive gag  -Sensory/Motor:  Patient localizing pain and spontaneous movement along R side.
Left side with minimal spontaneous movement and minimal withdrawal to pain.
L Lower extremity capable of minimal internal rotation and toe wiggling with noxious stimuli.
L Upper extremity with minimal finger movement to noxious stimuli.
Expected evolution of hemorrhagic blood products identified within the right MCA infarct.
No shift of normally midline structures or evidence of new hemorrhage.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2159-3-16**], the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is lower and the severity of mitral rgurgitation is slightly higher.
[**2160-10-19**] BRAIN MRI: The diffusion images demonstrate an area of restricted diffusion in the right middle cerebral artery indicative of an acute infarct.
There are blood products seen in the right subinsular region indicative of hemorrhagic conversion of the infarct.
There is mild mass effect on the right lateral ventricle.
There are extensive changes of small vessel disease identified as hyperintensities in the white matter.
There is a right frontal ventricular drain identified extending to the right lateral ventricle.
A defect in the left frontal bone could be related to previous drain placement.
Mild mass effect on the right lateral ventricle.
Extensive changes of small vessel disease as described above.
MRA NECK: Neck MRA demonstrates normal flow in the carotid and vertebral arteries without stenosis or occlusion.
IMPRESSION: Occlusion of the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery with some distal flow likely due to collateral circulation.
Brief Hospital Course: Precis of Hospital Course  Mrs. [**Known lastname 47862**] is a 78-year-old right-handed woman transferred from an outside hospital with a right middle cerebral artery stroke with hemorrhagic conversion.
Steroids were given for COPD flare and tapered.
Stroke She had previously refused coumadin despite long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation.
Atrial Fibrillation She remained rate-controlled during the admission with diltiazem.
No antibiotics were given - despite significant atelectasis, there was no evidence of pneumonia or infiltrate.
Diabetes Actually A1c in 5s - no evidence of diabetes.
5. senna 8.8 mg/5 mL Syrup Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
14. ipratropium bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for Wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 979**] - [**Location (un) 246**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Ischemic Stroke  Secondary Atrial Fibrillation Chonic partially-reversible obstructive pulmonary disease  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent, but difficult to understand.
Occasional mild confusion - mistake about which hospital she was in.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital after having a stroke.
This has left you with weakness of your left side, particularly the arm, although this has recovered markedly.
You had some difficulty eating, so we have placed a feeding tube so that you can get nutrition and receive medications.
