Exploratory thoracotomy with drainage of pleural and mediastinal  abscesses, revision of esophagogastric anastomosis, reinforced with pericardial thymic flap and total right lung decortication  [**2110-8-21**] 1.
ERCP with unsuccessful stent placement in pancreatic duct due to papilla edema  [**2110-9-10**] 1.
ERCP with pancreatic duct stent placement  [**2110-9-16**] EDG with successful esophageal stent removal  [**2110-9-17**] EDG with new esophageal stent placement  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69-year-old gentleman with multiple prior abdominal procedures including Nissen fundoplication and open cholecystectomy, who presents with biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus.
Preoperative staging suggested a T2 N0 lesion and given his good performance status he was recommended for primary resection with a decision regarding adjuvant therapy based on true pathologic stage.
His preoperative workup did show that he had a prior Nissen fundoplication which had slipped up into the chest.
B/L cataracts  Family History: non contributory  Physical Exam: general: well appearing man in NAD HEENT: unremarkable Cor: RRR S1, S@ ABD: Extrem: no C/C/E neuro: no focal deficits  Pertinent Results: IMAGING AS FOLLOWS:  [**2110-8-7**]: echo: Conclusions: The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Esophagus segment with gangrenous necrosis and focal bacterial overgrowth.
No evidence of malignancy.
Stomach segment with gangrenous necrosis and bacterial overgrowth.
No evidence of malignancy.
torso CT scan [**2110-9-1**]: CT OF THE CHEST: The large fluid collection in the right pleural space that extended across the midline into the mediastinum and into the abdominal cavity has decreased in size.
The area of ground-glass change in the left upper lobe anterior segment has resolved.
There is air present in the extrapleural anterior mediastinal space.
No pulmonary nodules are seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The peripancreatic fluid has decreased in size.
The small bowel and large bowel is unremarkable.
Re-demonstrated is stranding and infiltration of the anterior omentum likely secondary to post-op changes.
There is no free air.
CT OF THE PELVIS: There is a small amount of free fluid in the dependent portion of the pelvis.
BONE WINDOWS: No evidence of suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Interval improvement of right pleural space fluid collection secondary to leak.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are visualized status post esophagectomy and gastric pull-up.
Small amount of mediastinal/extrapleural air has developed in the left anterior hemithorax.
Very limited biliary cholangiogram demonstrates a slightly prominent distal CBD with no filling defects.
Pancreatic duct cholangiogram demonstrates slightly dilated pancreatic duct without evidence of stricture or filling defects and evidence of active extravasation of contrast noted within the region of the pancreatic body/tail.
Interval worsening of the esophageal leak adjacent to the right pleural cavity which is drained through right chest tube.
Unchanged moderate bilateral atelectatic changes at lung bases, which is more severe on the right side.
Small bilateral pleural effusion is unchanged.
Extension of inflammation within the right posterior chest wall is also unchanged.
Unchanged appearance of peripancreatic edema and small pseudocyst.
No intraabdominal or pelvic fluid collection is identified.
Small amount of free fluid tracking along the porta hepatis is unchanged.
The images are limited due to overlying artifact from wires and the patient's hand superimposed over the abdomen.
No significant interval change to bilateral small-to-moderate simple pleural effusions with probable subjacent atelectasis.
Medial and lateral components on the right side raise concern for loculation.
Persistent peripancreatic inflammatory changes with identification of known leak/small fluid collection and tract anteriorly where the surgical drain now terminates.
No evidence of pseudocyst or pancreatic necrosis.
Decreased air component within presumed omental infarction.
Wall thickening of ascending and proximal transverse colon suggestive of early colitis although evaluation is slightly limited due to lack of contrast progression into the large bowel.

His post-operative course was complicated by an anastomotic leak and a pancreatic fistula.
Cardiovascular:  He went into rapid a-fib and was placed on a diltiazem drip in the ICU, which converted him to sinus rhythmn.
On [**2110-9-8**] an EGD showed a chest tube in the esophageal lumen, which was pulled back and an ERCP was performed on the same date and a pancreatic stent was unable to be placed due to papilla edema.
A CT scan obtained on [**2110-9-11**] revealed a persistent esophageal leak.
He was transfused 3 units of PRBCs on [**8-5**] for his initial operation and 2 units of FFP on [**2110-8-7**].
Infectious Disease:  An ID consult was obtained and he was placed on an antibiotic regimen of Vancomycin, Cipro, and Fluconazole for the anastomotic leak and MRSA and non-fermenting gram-negative rods isolated on pleural fluid culture.
On [**2110-9-15**] vancomycin was stopped and Daptomycin was started to cover enterococcus and MRSA; the meropenem was continued to cover GNR's in pleural fluid.
He remained afebrile until [**2110-10-11**] when he developed fevers.
The PICC line was changed and the tip culture revealed no growth.
On [**2110-10-13**] the empyema culture grew klebsiella, enterococcus and [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.
The preliminary cultures grew GNR and GPC in pairs, chains and clusters no change from previous cultures.
He remained afebrile and the white count was trending down.
