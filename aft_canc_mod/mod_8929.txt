Admission Date:  [**2122-9-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-10-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2079-6-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4659**] Chief Complaint: Recurrent desmoid tumor   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left sided desmoid tumor removal, abdominal wall reconstruction, lower left rib resection, Left pneumothorax.
History of Present Illness: This patient is a 43-year-old woman who had a recurrent desmoid tumor in the left abdominal wall.
It did not appear to have any satellite lesions and it did not appear to have any intra-abdominal extension.
Chest Clear Breast not examined Cardiac RRR Abdomen mass left upper quadrant including costal margin  Pertinent Results: Hematocrit 30.8 -> 27.1 WBC 20.4 -> 9.6  Intraoperative ultrasound ([**9-25**]): Large left abdominal wall desmoid tumor which appears to be a solitary discretely marginated mass without obvious satellite nodules.
Chest X-Ray [**9-25**] (after left chest tube placement): The patient has had placement of a left-sided chest tube.
Increase haziness in the left lower lung may represent pleural fluid together with increased density in the left retrocardiac area, which likely represents atelectasis/airspace disease.
Chest X-Ray [**9-26**]: No significant adverse interval change is noted.
Left-sided pleural tube is unchanged in position.
No large pleural effusion is evident.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Minimal bibasilar atelectasis is seen.
Chest X-Ray [**9-27**]: When allowing for the technical changes and the differences in positioning there likely has been no major change.
There is bibasilar atelectasis with pulmonary vascular congestion but no pneumothorax.
Chest X-Ray [**9-28**]: Interval increase in right pleural effusion.
Pathology: Desmoid tumor involving abdominal wall and peritoneum/omentum.
Tumor may extend to inferomedial margin near the left rectus (Although tumor is present at ink, the margin surface is somewhat disrupted and clinical correlation is needed to determine margin involvement).
Brief Hospital Course: The patient underwent a radical excision of her recurrent abdominal wall desmoid tumor, ventral hernia repair with inlay of a double layer of Veritas, and partial chest wall (rib) resection on [**2122-9-25**] (see operative notes for full details).
In taking down an adhesed area in the left upper quadrant which was taken down and in doing so, the pleural cavity was entered and repaired with a chest tube left in place secondary to the left pneumothorax.
The patient's pain was controlled with a continuous epidural infusion managed by the acute pain service.
The chest tube was removed on [**9-27**] without complication.
JP#1 was removed on [**10-1**] without complication.
Upon discharge, the patient is afebrile, with all vitals stable, tolerating po feeds, ambulating with assistance, urinating without difficulty, with pain controlled on po meds, and with 1 JP in place.
