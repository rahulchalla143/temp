History of Present Illness: 65 M w recent dx lymphoboplasmacytic lymphoma now in remission s/p 4 cycles R-C-medrol [**2140**], who was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] ([**2142-3-7**] - [**2142-4-16**]) for a saccular aneurysm of the lateral aspect of the aortic arch that was emergenctly intervened upon under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest on [**2142-3-11**] (descending aorta was replaced with 28 mm Gelweave graft).
He had persistent leukocytosis, fevers, and diarrhea during hospitalization and was empirically treated for C. Diff with a 10-day course of vancomycin & flagyl (despite 7 negative C. Diff toxin tests).
His thoracotomy wound developed erythema and blistering and he had an incision & drainage of [**2142-3-21**] (fluid culture returned without growth).
He becam septic on [**2142-4-8**] and, in addition to persisent leukocytosis & fevers, he also became hypotensive and required pressors.
He was found to have a graft infection (noted on CT) requiring IR drainage on [**2142-4-8**].
On [**2142-4-24**], the patient presented to the [**Hospital3 **] from NESH with hypoxic respiratory failure with hypotension & fever to 101.3.
In he ED he was found to have a PNA which was ultimately determined to be due to Enterobacter resistant to all tested antibiotics except tigecycline.
He has since been stable from a hemodynamic & respiratory standpoint.
A CT chest with contrast performed (& read) at OSH demonstrated a 7 x 3.4 x 1.7 cm loculated pleural fluid collection at the lateral posterior aspect of the L lung base.
Serial chest x-rays during his admission at [**Hospital3 **] demonstrated development of a a R lower lobe PNA.
The patient has had an intermittent leukocytosis with bandemia at the [**Hospital3 **].
The scan demonstrated increased update in the L chest adjacent to the aortic arch which was suspicious for a periarotic infection.
According to notes, he has been afebrile for several days but developed WBC 12.3 with 13% bands [**Last Name (un) **].

The likelihood of a left pleural effusion is low.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 M with recent complicated hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent aortic surgery for a saccular aneurysm which was complicated by graft infection requiring IR drainage on [**2142-4-8**], enterobacter VAP now represents after initial hospitalization at OSH for ongoing enterobacter pneumonia & respiratory failure.
# Chronic Respiratory Failure:  The patient is now s/p tracheostomy on [**2142-4-1**] for multiple failed extubation attempts.
His most recent CT scan shows evidence of bronchiectasis.
He will continue supplemental oxygen via trach mask on discharge; he will likely having an ongoing oxygen requirement.
There was no evidence of leukocytosis during his short hospitalization.
The patient remained afebrile without signs of systemic infection.
There was some concern for a L-sided loculated effusion on OSH CT scan, but on review of these scans (compared to prior) these changes appear to be chronic.
As such, there was low suspicion for empyema.
Given the patient's ongoing diarrhea which has been unremitting since his initially hospitalizaton for cardiac surgery as well as his exposure to multiple antibiotics, it was felt that a C. Diff PCR should be sent.
Given the patient's lack of abdominal pain, fever, & leukocytosis suspicion for C. Diff infection remained low.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES:  # Hypertension: Pt's BP on presentation was in the low 100s.
# Diverticulosis: Continue bowel regimen.
# Gout: Continue allopurinol.

You came to [**Hospital1 18**] from an outside hospital due to concern that you had a recurrent infection in near the site of your aortic graft.
While you were here, we reviewed the films from the outside hospital and determined that you did not have evidence of an infection.
