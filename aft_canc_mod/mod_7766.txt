She was in usual state of health prior to [**2111-2-3**] when she noted gradual onset nausea, abdominal discomfort and unintentional 10 pound weight loss.
This progressed to jaundice prompting admission to OSH [**2111-2-12**] and diagnosis of stricture on RUQ US.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2111-2-17**] for repeat [**Date Range **] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who replaced stent for finding of 15mm common hepatic duct stent and obtained brushings which ultimately revealed atypical cells.
At that time, the stent was replaced for finding of worsening CHD stricture.
Following return to OSH, Ms. [**Known lastname 31624**] was still febrile to 103.6 [**Hospital 92285**] transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] hepatobiliary service for management of her refractory stricture.

[**2111-2-17**] Common bile duct, brushing: ATYPICAL, Rare group of atypical epithelial cells in a background of benign appearing ductal epithelial cells.
[**2111-3-25**] CXR: IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**3-15**] through 19: Small bilateral pleural effusions and severe bibasilar atelectasis are unchanged since [**3-22**].
No pneumothorax.
There is continued bibasilar opacification, most likely consistent with pleural fluid and compressive atelectasis, more prominent on the right.
The possibility of supervening pneumonia would certainly have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
High-grade obstruction at the level of the hepatic confluence.
Left moderate to severe biliary dilatation.
No right biliary dilatation (plastic stent in place).
CT Abdomen with and without contrast [**2111-3-21**]: Final Report HISTORY: 68-year-old female with a history of biliary stricture status post [**Month/Day/Year **] and stent placement and persistent cholangitis now status post left external percutaneous biliary drain.
FINDINGS: Small bilateral pleural effusions consisting of minimally complex pleural fluid are present with associated compressive atelectasis.
Its course demonstrates either possibly a kinked contour or a sharp bend around a drainage hole (2; 15 and 400a; 32).
The liver demonstrates definite improvement of the intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Periportal edema is still present.
The gallbladder shows no definite evidence of stones or wall edema.
The pancreas shows no ductal dilatation, peripancreatic inflammation, or hypoenhancement.
However, a small amount of peripancreatic fluid or hypodense tissue is present, and while is not definitely organized, it does not appear to have appreciable fat stranding associated with it.
The visualized portion of the small and large bowel show no evidence of obstruction or wall edema.
The kidneys enhance with and excrete contrast symmetrically without evidence of a mass or hydronephrosis.
A subtle area of cortical thinning in the mid pole of the left kidney may represent an area of prior infection or infarct (400a; 55).
There is no free air or lymphadenopathy.
The celiac artery demonstrates conventional branching pattern with a patent hepatic artery branching to both the right and left lobes.
There is no evidence of a pseudoaneurysm.
BONES: No aggressive-appearing lytic or sclerotic lesion is present.
Mild-to-moderate degenerative changes are seen throughout the visualized portion of the spine, primarily in the form of endplate sclerosis and small osteophytes.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Patent hepatic arterial and venous vasculature.
Small amount of fluid or hypodense soft tissue around the pancreas without appreciable surrounding inflammation may represent sequela of prior pancreatitis, post-surgical change, adenopathy, or mass; endoscopic ultrasound and biopsy may be considered.
She was weaned off ventilation and repeat CXR on [**2111-3-25**] showed resolution of her right side opacity.
She had no further respiratory issues during her hospital stay.
On [**2111-3-24**], Ms. [**Known lastname 31624**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] placement of a right side internal-external biliary drain and [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] internalization of her left side biliary drain.
She was afebrile with stable vital signs for the remainder of her hospital stay.
7. oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain at drain sites: Do not drive while on this medication.
Please call Dr.[**Name (NI) 1369**] office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] if you have temperature of 101 or greater, chills, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, increased abdominal pain, drain sites appear red or have drainage, constipation/diarrhea or drain sutures fall or "stat lock" falls off.
