She is known to have carcinoma implants along both hemidiaphragms, the right lobe of the liver, and the lower abdomen on the sigmoid colon and appendix.
This surgery was reported to be uneventful with minimal blood loss but some intra-peritoneal intra-peritoneal spillage.
IR was consulted but postop anterior abdominal collection which was too small to drain.
Follow up CT scans were performed to see progression of collection with gradual resolution noted on imaging.
Interventional pulmonology was consulted for therapeutic thoracentesis of left pleural effusion in hopes of improving patient's dyspnea.
400 cc of seroud fluid was drained, with no bacterial growth, and chemistries consistent with transudate.
On presentation, she complained of one week of subjective fevers, generalized  abdominal pain, and anorexia.
Her recent course after discharge has been complicated by DVT (now on coumadin) and UTI treated at rehabilitation.
She denied diarrhea, fever, or respiratory symptoms.
She had nausea and vomiting along her diffuse abdominal pain.
No GI bleeding.
No urinary symptoms.
Needs evaluation for cause of abdominal pain, likely CT.   Past Medical History: Past Medical History: -Recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer s/p TAH/BSO debulking and chemotherapy.
She was initially diagnosed with stage IIC ovarian cancer at the time of exploratory laparotomy on [**2118-7-19**].
CT scan showed no convincing areas of disease.
The patient underwent laparoscopic evaluation by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] where multiple tiny peritoneal implants were seen and biopsy was consistent with recurrent adenocarcinoma ovarian primary.
She had been stable until [**4-30**] when she developed abominal pain, concern for acute appendicitis, and underwent lap appy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1924**] which revealed several carcinoma implants along both hemidiaphragms, the right lobe of the liver, and the lower abdomen on the sigmoid colon and appendix; she also had a small amount of ascites.
Sclera anicteric, dry membranes, oropharynx clear is clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: anteriorly CTAB, but not taking large breaths CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  Ostomy in place with drainage of liquid stools, vertical incision with bandage overlying and retention sutures in place; non-distended, severe and diffuse tenderness tpo light palpation with hard areas from scr, tumor or inflammation.
GU: foley in place Ext: cold, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: No dementia or delirium  Pertinent Results: 1.
No findings of bowel obstruction or etiology for patient's symptoms identified.
Within the limits of non-contrast CT, no intra-abdominal abscess or free fluid.
Bilateral hyperdense, renal cysts as detailed above.
- CXR ([**2124-6-1**]): In comparison with study of [**5-6**], there is better expansion of the lungs with no evidence of pneumonia, vascular congestion, pleural effusion or metastatic disease.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 59 year old woman with metastatic ovarian cancer (she has known implants along both hemidiaphragm, the right lobe of the liver, and the lower abdomen on the sigmoid colon and appendix) who presented with one week of subjective fevers, generalized abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea and vomiting.
She had a perforated transverse colon; a right extended hemicolectomy and end ileostomy was performed with some intra-peritoneal intra-peritoneal spillage.
During that admission, she received Vancomycin, Meropenem, Ciprofloxacin and Fluconazole, diuresed with IV Lasix, received TPN, IR was consulted about post-op anterior abdominal collection which was too small to drain, and IP was did therapeutic thoracentesis of left pleural effusion (no bacterial growth; transudate).
Her recent course after discharge was complicated by DVT (now on Coumadin) and UTI treated at rehabilitation.
Her blood tests showed severe [**Last Name (un) **] with severe acidosis (with gap), hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, persistent leukocytosis with bands.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she had CT of the abdomen without IV and PO contrast to rule out bowel obstruction, recurrent perforation, abdominal abscess, or complication from her recent surgery.
The very limited CT showed no findings of bowel obstruction or etiology for patient's symptoms.
Her UA was positive and patient started emperically on cefepime for UTI in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
However, her culture was positive for a yeast.
Her metabolic acidosis was from [**Last Name (un) **]/ARF and resolved after hydration.
The urine electrolytes were consistent with pre-renal process from dehydration.
