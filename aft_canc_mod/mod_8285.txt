Admission Date:  [**2131-10-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-11-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2093-4-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 32912**] Chief Complaint: 2cm cyst in body of pancreas with history of recurrent pancreatitis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Robotic-assisted minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy with intraoperative ultrasound.
Exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, and drainage of left upper quadrant intra-abdominal fluid collection.
History of Present Illness: 38 y/o female with a history of multiple episodes of pancreatitis and a cystic mass in the body of the pancreas who comes to the office for surgical evaluation.
In short, her first episode of pancreatitis was in [**2130-2-28**], when she presented with epigastric pain radiating to the back.
She was hospitalized, and CT of the abdomen showed a ~2 cm cystic mass in the body of the pancreas, and evidence of pancreatitis in the pancreatic tail.
She was discharged and was doing well until [**2131-7-29**], when she again presented with epigastric pain radiating to the back.
Work-up during her second hospitization was notable for triglyceride of 830, lipase of 782, and normal LFTs; MRCP showed no significant interval change in the pancreatic cystic mass, atrophy of the pancreatic tail, no biliary dilatation, no gallstones, no choledocholithiasis.
Her pancreatitis was attributed to elevated triglycerides, and she was put on gemfibrazil.
It was recommended that she undergo fine needle aspiration of the cystic mass with endoscopic ultrasound.
Since then, she's had another episode of pancreatitis, and GI performed FNA of the cyst, which was acellular with CEA of 43ng/Ml and amylase of 109,200.
After being seen in surgery clinic twice by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further evaluation, it was felt that she likely had a mucinous cystic neoplasm and that it was likely the cause of her recurrent pancreatitis.
Family History: No family history of pancreatic cancer or pancreatitis.
Physical Exam: GENERAL: NAD, AOx3 CARDIOVASCULAR: RRR, no m/g/r LUNGS: CTAB ABDOMEN: soft, non-distended, mild peri-incisional tenderness to palpation, incisions healing well with no erythema or drainage, JP drain in place with minimal [**Doctor Last Name 352**] serous fluid in bulb and no surrounding erythema or drainage at insertion site.
EXTREMITIES: warm and well perfused, no edema   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 38 y/o female with a history of multiple episodes of pancreatitis and a cystic mass in the body of the pancreas who, after being seen in clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], decided to go forward with surgical management of her pancreatic cyst.
On [**2131-10-10**] the patient underwent a robotic-assisted minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy with intraoperative ultrasound with no intraoperative complications.
After a brief stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids with a foley catheter, and a dilaudid PCA for pain control.
Given her persistent tachycardia and falling hematocrit, she was transfused one unit of blood and received a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis on the morning of [**2131-10-11**] that showed the presence of hematoma adjacent to the divided pancreas without evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma related to the inferior epigastric artery.
On operation, she was found to be bleeding from the edge of her intact splenic artery staple line, and underwent oversewing and repair of the splenic artery with placement of an intra-abdominal drain.
On the evening following her re-operation, she acutely desaturated in to the 85% range and became tachycardic into the 140's, prompting a CTA of the chest that revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolism but did show a multifocal pneumonia.
On [**10-18**] her creatinine bumped to 1.4 from a baseline of 0.4, so her Vanc and Zosyn were stopped given she had received a 7 day course of antibiotics and was now experiencing acute kidney injury.
She also became increasingly distended and had 3 episodes of bilious emesis, so an NG tube was placed to suction with an immediate return of 1.5 liters of bilious gastric fluid.
It was felt that her renal failure was likely pre-renal azotemia and not a manifestation of bowel ischemia, and she was aggressively rehydrated and a renal consult was placed, who agreed that she was likely dehydrated and pre-renal due to rapid fluid shifts and fluid losses in the setting of a small bowel obstruction.
A CT abdomen/pelvis was performed that showed a high grade small bowel obstruction in the LUQ in the area of the surgical bed, but given that she was only one week post-op it was felt that conservative management with NG tube and IV fluids would be the best course for the time being, and she was also started on TPN for nutrition.
Unfortunately, after 3 days of NG tube suction she developed coffee-ground output with intermittent episodes of bright red bloody output from her NG tube despite being on a PPI twice daily, became tachycardic, and her hematocrit began to fall despite receiving 1 unit of packed RBC's, with a nadir of 18.0 on [**10-24**].
Ms. [**Known lastname **] also failed to resume bowel function with consistently high NG tube outputs, and in combination with her new upper GI bleed it was now felt that she would need to be taken back to the OR for an EGD and exploratory laparotomy in the setting of a background concern for bowel ischemia.
On operation and EGD she was found to have a non-bleeding ulcer, a retroperitoneal abscess in the left upper quadrant over which the proximal jejunum was densely adherent causing the proximal small-bowel obstruction, and viable non-ischemic bowel.
After surgery she returned to the ICU, where she developed an anemia post-operatively on [**2131-10-26**] and was transfused with two units of ABO compatible pRBCS.
A chest x-ray showed worsened interval pulmonary edema with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.
Her O2 sat was stabilized and her interval chest x-rays showed no change.
Echocardiogram showed normal ventricular function without signs of volume overload.
Over the next two days, she weaned off oxygen support, and never had any other symptoms such as hives, jaundice, or hematuria.
By [**10-29**] her pulmonary infiltrates were resolving on her chest xray, her creatinine was trending down, and her hemodynamics were overall stable with some tachycardia and episodes of hypertension that were treated with and responsive to lopressor and IV hydralazine, and she was ultimately deemed stable for transfer back to the floor.
Her platelet count continued to be in the 1000-1400 range and her GI bleed was resolved, so she was started on aspirin 325mg daily for anticoagulation in addition to her subcutaneous heparin.
She remained stable hemodynamically, was ambulating and voiding without assistance, and her pain was well controlled on PO oxycodone.
Pancreatic mucinous cystic neoplasm (2.0 cm) with ovarian-type stroma and minimal epithelial atypia.
Post-operative splenic artery bleed 3.
Multifocal pneumonia 4. acute kidney injury 5. small bowel obstruction 6. upper gastrointestinal bleed 7. gastric ulcer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision site.
You may shower, and wash surgical incisions with a mild soap and warm water.
JP Drain Care: Please look at the site every day for signs of infection (increased redness or pain, swelling, odor, yellow or bloody discharge, warm to touch, fever greater than 101 degrees).
Specifically, please keep records of how much fluid came out during each day (there are CC markers on the bulb that you can use to estimate the daily drainage before you empty the bulb for the day).
You may shower; wash the area gently with warm, soapy water, but otherwise please keep the insertion site clean and dry otherwise.
Make sure to keep the drain is attached securely to your body to prevent pulling or dislocation.
Please also follow up with your Primary Care Doctor as soon as possible, ideally within one week from discharge, for a wellness check and to go over your recent hospitalization and medication changes.
