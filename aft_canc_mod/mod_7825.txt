Admission Date:  [**2132-10-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-10-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2088-2-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12174**] Chief Complaint: Expidited pre-transplant workup for decompensated cirrhosis; Maroon blood in colostomy bag  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right Heart Catheterization Upper Endoscopy Ileoscopy   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 91442**] is a pleasant 44 year old woman with a history of UC s/p total colectomy, PSC diagnosed in [**2111**], cirrhosis diagnosed in [**2129**], and CML on gleevac (since [**2127**]) who presents for expidited pre-transplant workup from clinic.
The patient states that she first experienced clinical manifestations of her liver disease in [**2129**] following her total colectomy.
A biopsy performed at that time revealed cirrhosis with extensive canalicular cholestasis.
Liver disease was well controlled until after her colectomy in [**2129**], when her bilirubin began to rise.
In the last two months, she has become more symptomatic with jaundice and volume overload.
On [**2132-9-8**], the patient was admitted to [**Hospital 794**] hospital with worsening ascites, anasarca, and acute kidney injury.
Following her discharge, she has experienced episodes of severe fatigue and mild dyspnea on exertion.
Today, she presented to liver clinic for transplantation evaluation and complained of non-productive cough x 5 days, SOB, ongoing fatigue.
She has not had any history of prior GI bleed and denies any hematochezia, melena, hematemesis, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.
She was admitted directly from liver clinic for hypotension to the 70s and need for expedited transplant work up.
A small amount of ascites was seen on US, therefore she was sent for IR guided paracentesis, which was unusucessful.
Vanc/ceftriaxone was started for coverage of SBP and PNA given recent respiratory symptoms.
She was also given albumin for SBP treatment.
Ms. [**Known lastname 91442**] has a degree in business from CAL State and worked as an account manager for an HMO prior to having children.

Small scarred and distorted liver, which makes it difficult to assess for small focal lesions.
Consider alternative forms of imaging such as CT or MRI to further characterize the hepatic architecture.
Small gallbladder polyp.
No evidence of pneumonia.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic biventricular systolic function.
No significant valvular abnormality seen.
Mildly elevated pulmonary artery pressures that likely reflect increased flow rather than intrinsic lung disease.
Markedly cirrhotic / fibrotic liver with segmental atrophy of the entire left lobe and segment VIII of the liver.
No suspicious focal liver lesion identifed.
There is peripheral segmental intra-hepatic biliary dilatation in keeping with primary sclerosing cholangitis.
Sequela of portal hypertension including splenomegaly, para-esophageal and left upper quadrant varices, recanalisation of the para-umbilical vein, and trace of perihepatic ascites.
Loculated ascites in the right lower quadrant.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right side and left sided filling pressures with an RVEDP 17 mm Hg and mean PCW 23 mm Hg.
Mild pulmonary hypertension with a PASP 42mm Hg and mean PA pressure of 30 mm Hg.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Elevated pulmonary wedge pressure.
Bilateral Screening Mammogram [**2132-10-22**]: No evidence for malignancy.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 91442**] is a pleasant 44 yo F with hx UC s/p colectomy, and cirrhosis [**1-9**] PSC, admitted from liver clinic due to recent decompensation and need for expedited transplant workup; admission complicated by bleed and leukocytosis.
She was found to have maroon stool in colostomy bag.
She was transferred to the ICU out of concern for variceal bleed given history of liver disease.
EGD/Ileostomy in the ICU were remarkable for absence of varices and a non-bleeding ulcer at the GE junction with old blood in the stomach.
She did have significant peristomal bleeding in the ICU, which was thought to be the primary source of the bleed.
She underwent ultrasound that showed peristomal varices.
She was started on a PPI and octreotide for GE junction ulcer and peristomal varices.
Peristomal bleeding was stopped by transplant surgery with Surgicel.
She continued to have minor oozing from around her stoma without hemodynamic significance.
Per transplant surgery recommendations, the patient was discharged with silver nitrate for peristomal bleeding.
Leukocytosis: On admission, the patient was found to have a leukocytosis to 21 in the setting of hypotension to the 70's.
Leukocytosis was initially concerning for SBP given ascitic fluid, however she was unable to undergo paracentesis under IR due to scant amount of fluid present.
Chest X-ray was normal and urine cultures showed no growth.
The patient then became leukopenic, likely secondary to Gleevac.
Hypotension: The patient was admitted with hypotension to the 70's, most likely due to GIB.
Hypotension improved following a total of 6 units PRBCs and stabilization of bleed.
The patient did not spike fevers or have a localizing source of infection on admission to support sepsis as a cause of hypotension.
# Cirrhosis [**1-9**] PSC: Complicated by jaundice, ascites, and possible hepatic encephalopathy.
Recent decompensation without clear etiology.
Patient admitted for expedited transplant workup which included MRCP, PFTs, ECHO, CXR, screening mammogram, pap smear, right heart catheterization, and Panorex (given history of strep viridans).
They continued the patient on gleevac, and commented that CML with gleevac use should have no effect on peri-transplant management or post-transplant prognosis.
Urine electrolytes consistent with prerenal azotemia.
The patient was repleted with both crystalloid and colloid for volume resuscitation.
# Metabolic acidosis:  The patient was admitted with both an anion gap and non-gap metabolic acidosis.
Anion gap metabolic acidosis likely due to renal failure.
Etiology of non-gap acidosis unclear, as patient was without diarrhea, evidence of fistula or medication which could be contributing.
# Hyponatremia: The patient was admitted with hyponatremia to 117.
Hyponatremia likely hypovolemic, as it normalized with fluid resuscitation.
# Ulcerative colitis s/p total colectomy with end ileostomy: Chronic.
Patient without further GI symptoms following total colectomy.
During admission, gleevac was decreased to 200 mg daily, as the patient became increasingly pancytopenic (WBC count nadir 1.4, baseline 3.0).
As part of the patient's pretransplant workup, the hematology/oncology team noted that CML with gleevac use should have no effect on peri-transplant management or post-transplant prognosis.
3. silver nitrate applicators     Misc Sig: [**12-9**] Miscs Topical PRN (as needed) as needed for stomal bleeding.
Disp:*15 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses:  PSC cirrhosis (decompensated with jaundice, ascites); peri-stomal variceal bleed Secondary diagnoses:  Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, Chronic myeloid leukemia, Ulcerative colitis s/p total colectomy   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
On admission, you were found to have an elevated white blood cell count and a very low red blood cell count (anemia).
You were found to have old blood in your stomach, but no evidence of active bleed.
You were found to have significant bleeding from around your stoma.
The bleeding was stopped by our surgical colleagues with surgicel and you were transfused 6 units of packed red blood cells.
Because of your elevated white blood cell count, we were concerned that you had infection of your ascites.
You went to interventional radiology, but did not have enough ascites in your abdomen to adequately sample.
You were treated with antibiotics for presumed "spontaneous bacterial peritonitis", or infection of ascites.
You did not have any fevers throughout admission.
Upon discharge, you will start ciprofloxacin 250 mg daily to prevent against future episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
You had many screening labs for infectious and immunologic processes.
