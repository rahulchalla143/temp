Admission Date:  [**2174-5-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2174-5-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2105-5-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: carbamazepine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9160**] Chief Complaint: Chief Complaint:  fall, leg weakness  Reason for MICU transfer: intubation, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: - ERCP - IR percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram with placement of 10F left internal/external drain - R CVL placement by IR - L CVL Removal - IR placement of IVC filter - IR placement of stent and removal of biliary drain  History of Present Illness: 69F h/o developmental delay, seizures, OSA on CPAP, GERD, who initally presented to [**Last Name (un) 4199**] with LE weakness and fall, as well as blood in stools.
She was found to have an increased troponin, anemia, and hyponatremia.
She was given 2U RBC's and may have had a transfusion reaction although this is unclear from [**Name (NI) 4199**] documentation.
She is being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from Wooden (admitted [**5-4**] for weakness and anemia).
During a prep for cscopy, had afib with RVR, then developed hypotension briefly requiring pressors while on dilt gtt.
She was electively intubated for increased work of breathing and respiratory distress at the OSH.
She was given vanc, CTX, flagyl for GPC's and GNR's in BCx (initially was on CTX and gent, but after speciated as klebsiella, gent was d/c'd).
She was found to have increased Tbili to 4, and RUQ US was unrevealing but CT scan showed abnl gallbladder with markedly thickened gallbladder wall and dilated CBD.

She is not having shaking or pursing her lips.
-[**5-10**] CT abd/pelvis from [**Last Name (un) 4199**]: Two gallbladder-to-distal small bowel fistulas with associated severe gallbladder wall thickening.
This is highly suspicious for gallbladder carcinoma with possible local invasion of the adjacent liver and adjacent loop of colon.
Alternatively, and probably less likely, this could be due to chronic inflammatory process of the gallbladder.
Severe extrahepatic and intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with pneumobilia.
Dilatation tapers at the level of the distal CBD without obvious obstructing mass lesion visualized.
No bowel obstruction.
Mild ascites and small b/l pleural effusions.
-[**5-10**] CXR Bibasilar opacities are largely attrributible to small effusions and atelectasis, as seen on recent CT.  A small opacity in the lingula could represent a small focus of pneumonia.
No targetable liver lesion identified.
No intrahepatic bile duct dilation.
Circumferential gallbladder cancer erodes into a small bowel loop in the right upper quadrant (21: 24) and also possibly into the liver.
Two hepatic lesions are most consistent with bilomas.
No intrahepatic duct dilatation, the common bile duct is dilated within its central portion measuring up to 1.2 cm but tapers distally.
Moderate ascites.
Small bilateral pleural effusions - [**5-14**] CXR AP chest compared to [**5-10**] through 18: There are now more discrete areas of consolidation in the right mid and lower lung zones, which could be due to pneumonia.
Aeration in the left lower lobe is compromised but unchanged since [**5-10**], probably atelectasis.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed.
No pneumothorax.
- [**5-15**] LUE U/S: There is an occlusive clot in a short segment of the left cephalic vein.
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis or hematoma.
- [**5-17**] Lower extremity U/S: Non-occlusive thrombus involving the distal left superficial femoral vein.
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right lower extremity deep veins.
- [**5-18**] echo The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
Small LV cavity size with hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
Consequently there is a mild left ventricular outflow tract gradient during systole.
No significant valvular abnormality seen.
Mildly elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiogram may better assess for valvular vegetations.
The patient can be brought in a few days for repeat cholangiogram and removal of the catheter, if there is no evidence of cholestasis or cholangitis.
Note:  There is noticeable atypia in this scant glandular epithelium.
[**2174-5-20**] Gallbladder Cytology pending  - [**2174-5-25**] CT HEAD No acute intracranial process.
- EEG [**2174-5-25**] (24 hour): This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of mild diffuse background slowing indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction with non-specific etiology.
No epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures are present.
Compared to the prior day's  recording, there are no significant changes.
Note is made of an irregular heart rhythm with intermittent borderline tachycardia and occasional wide complex premature beats.
- [**2174-5-27**] CXR Lung opacities likely due to multifocal pneumonia.

There she was found to have an increased troponin, anemia, and hyponatremia.
She was noted to have rising liver enzymes and a CT scan that showed an abnormal gallbladder with markedly thickened gallbladder wall and dilated common bile duct and possible gallbladder carcinoma.
She was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] as she was intubated for respiratory distress at the OSH.
She was then transferred to IR for biliary drainage, and findings were suspicious, but not diagnostic, for gallbladder cancer.
ACTIVE ISSUES:  # Goals of Care: meetings were held with HCP/partner, [**Name (NI) **] to discuss patient's likely diagnosis of cancer, for which the patient is not a surgical or chemo candidate.
She was given small doses of morphine for persistent right upper quadrant pain.
She was originally on oral keppra, but was observed to choke/gargle even with minimal quantity of the liquid; thus she was transitioned to standing lorazepam that could be absorbed orally.
INPATIENT ISSUES:  # Cholangitis, bacteremia: At OSH, pt had GPC's and GNR's in blood cultures.
She was found to have increased Tbili to 4, and CT scan showing abnormal gallbladder with markedly thickened gallbladder wall and dilated common bile duct, suggesting biliary tract was likely source.
# Fungemia: [**12-29**] blood cultures positive for yeast from [**5-13**], though subsequent surveillance culture were negative.
ECHO evaluation for endocarditis and ophthalmology evaluation for endopthalmitis were negative.
# Likely GB malignancy: MRCP suggestive of malignancy with formation of enteric fistulas and some sign of hepatic involvement.
Per hepatobiliary surgery, patient is poor surgical candidate.
Hem/Onc also feels chemotherapeutic options are limited.
Final pathology from brushings/biopsy revealed glandular atypia but no definitive carcinoma.
Reportedly had blood in stools recently.
Iron studies revealed anemia of chronic inflammation and some hypoproliferation.
Her stools remained guaiac positive while here but without frank blood.
# Left lower extremity DVT: Non-occlusive thrombus found in left leg after patient complained of some leg pain.
Heparin drip started on [**5-18**], which was later stopped after patient developed coffee-ground emesis.
# UGIB: Developed coffee ground emesis on [**5-18**], though maintained stable vitals and hematocrit.
KUB was negative for obstruction.
She had no further episodes.
# Extremity weakness: Per chart, patient has history of left-sided weakness, though at baseline is able to walk with a cane.
Likely worsened by her deconditioning due to critical illness.
The patient's weakness worsened as her overall clinical status worsened.
# Hypoxia/intubation: Pt was not intubated at the OSH for respiratory failure, but rather acidosis and increased work of breathing.
Her persistent hypoxia on the floor was felt due to a combination of ventilator-associated pneumonia, COPD, OSA, pulmonary edema, and possible aspiration events in setting of upper GI bleed.
She completed a course for VAP and was diuresed daily to help with volume overload.
# Afib with RVR: This appears to be new onset and began at [**Last Name (un) 4199**] during colonoscopy prep.
On the floor, she had intermittent bursts of supraventricular tachycardia but no further atrial fibrillation while hospitalized.
# Previous hypotension: Pt was normo- to hypertensive on admission, but she had lower BP's to the 100's after being started on a Diltiazem drip.
This was similar to what happened at [**Last Name (un) 4199**], where she developed hypotension briefly requiring pressors while on Diltiazem drip.
# Elevated INR to 3.9 upon admission: Remained elevated throughout despite improvement of LFTs.
Likely due to hepatic involvement of malignancy and poor nutrition.
CHRONIC ISSUES:  # OSA on CPAP: was initially intubated, and then continued on CPAP at night while on the floor.
# Seizure disorder: History of complex partial seizures, none during her current stay, confirmed on 24h EEG.
# Developmental delay/Paranoia: Held risperidone while NPO  # Chronic pain: Held gabapentin while NPO  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # CODE STATUS: DNR/DNI .

Discharge Instructions: Dear [**Known firstname **],   You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] because you had a serious infection of your gallbladder and bloodstream likely due to an underlying cancer.
A blood clot was found in a vein in your leg so a filter was placed in your vein to help prevent it from moving.
A drain and stent were also placed in your gallbladder to open up blockages, help relieve pain and help drain the infection.
