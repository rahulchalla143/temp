Complained of sensation of "food getting stuck" and pointed to proximal throat.
CT scan revealed impingement of the esophagus at the level of the thyroid, likely secondary to thyroid enlargement from hx of thyroid malignancy.

COPD exacerbation 2.
Obstructive sleep apnea 2.
Dysphagia related to esophageal compression from thyroid cancer   Discharge Condition: Ambulatory.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with shortness of breath.
Initially, you went to the ICU because we felt that your shortness of breath could be related to sleep apnea.
Since you continued to have a cough, we treated you for worsening of your COPD.
You also told us that you had some trouble swallowing.
We did a CT scan which showed that some of your esophagus, or swallowing tube, was being compressed probably because you have a history of thyroid cancer.
We did a test that measures your swallowing ability and found that you should try to eat softer foods and your pills should be crushed before you take them.
Please return to the emergency room or contact your physician for chest pain, shortness of breath, increased difficulty with swallowing, difficulty with breathing, or for any other symptoms which are concerning to you.
