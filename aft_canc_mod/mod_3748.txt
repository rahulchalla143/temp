Multiple extra-axial, supratentorial punctate densities along the sulci may be vascular in origin or could represent prior cisternogram, however given the clinical history secondary hemorrhagic metastasic deposits are also included in the differential.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, new region of edema, or new mass effect.
Previously described ring-enhancing lesion is not well demonstrated today, but could be due to differences in technique.
For more sensitive evaluation for metastasic disease and infarction direct comparison with prior MR, repeat MRI may be performed as clinically indicated.
Allowing for respiratory motion, no large or central pulmonary embolism seen.
Subcutaneous collection in left posterior chest wall deep to surgical incision could represent postoperative hematoma although communication with pleural fluid cannot be excluded.
Left upper lobe atelectasis/mass with attenuation of pulmonary artery and bronchi.
Diffuse abnormality of the colon and rectum with mucosal enhancement, submucosal thickening and pericolonic stranding.
Findings are nonspecific and could represent, for example, an infectious colitis.
Ischemic colitis less likely.
Trace fluid tracking along the left paracolic gutter with small fluid in pelvis.
No free air.
Multiple sclerotic lesions in the axial skeleton concerning for metastatic disease in this patient with history of malignancy.
Correlation with prior bone scan or other imaging recommended.
Anterior wedge compression deformity of T12 of indeterminate chronicity without comparison.
Presacral hyperattenuating lesions likely representing enhancing soft tissue, the more superior one abutting the sacrum with possible bony involvement, concerning for metastases.
Diffuse atherosclerotic disease, with focal ectasia of infrarenal abdominal aorta.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 67yoF with a history of breast cancer and metastatic non small cell lung cancer who was intubated at an OSH for respiratory distress and transferred for further management of respirator failure.
# Respiratory failure: in the setting of known NSCLC.
She had leukocytosis at OSH prior to transfer w/bandemia.
Otherwise, CXR revealed mass and left sided effusion, but no other acute changes.
Exam is w/o evidence of COPD flare and CXR does not reveal evidence of PNA.
Respiratory distress may have been secondary to primary metabolic acidosis.
Unlikely [**12-20**] high tumor burden causing respiratory failure.
When sedated to this degree, the pt did have significant drops in her BP requiring pressor support.
# Metabolic acidosis - nongap at time of presentation to OSH ED; pt did have diarrhea with later positive C diff.
; No h/o fevers and pt had been afebrile prior to admisison but w/leukocytosis to 33.7 and impressive bandemia and lactate of 3.2.
# NSCLC - had XRT to brain and per report had scheduled chemo prior to admission.
