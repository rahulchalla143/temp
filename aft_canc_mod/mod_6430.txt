Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: ====================== Mr. [**Known lastname 78794**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] biopsy of a scalp lesion with pathology revealing a 5.5 mm thick desmoplastic melanoma with evidence of focal ulceration.
He subsequently [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] an excision on [**5-7**], [**2182**] with pathology revealing residual desmoplastic melanoma extending close to the deep margin.
He had a wide excision of the area on [**2183-6-23**] with reconstruction on [**2183-7-3**] with no sentinel lymph node identified.
Pathology revealed no remaining melanoma.
In [**2183-11-1**], a small nodule was identified behind his left ear.
CT scan of his neck and torso was performed revealing multiple pulmonary nodules and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, concerning for metastasis.
He began the Phase 3 Trial of STA-4783 in Combination with Paclitaxel vs. Paclitaxel Alone on [**2183-12-30**] with progression after 2 cycles.
He was recently admitted to [**Hospital **] hospital on [**2184-4-16**] with severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, dehydration and severe fatigue and was discharged [**2184-4-21**].
Upon admission, he [**Month/Day/Year 1834**] CT scan of chest revealing innumerable pulmonary parenchymal metastases in the bilateral lungs, extensive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, osseous lesion in the left second and third ribs and T7 vertebral body.
This revealed a 7 mm hyperdense focus with surrounding  vasogenic edema in the right centrum semiovale and a smaller enhancing nodule in the right corona radiata.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ==================== *diabetes mellitus two *hypercholesterolemia *hypertension *heart murmur *clavicular fracture and a right shoulder dislocation in the remote past *cholecystectomy performed 30 years ago.
Family History: There is no family history of melanoma or other cancers.

Increasing vasogenic edema associated with tiny metastatic lesion in the right centrum semiovale.
Marked bronchial compression and malacia, particularly at the upper lobes, without evidence of endobronchial spread.
Innumerable pulmonary nodules, hilar, mediastinal, and left axillary adenopathy consistent with metastatic disease, slightly progressed since the prior study.
New nodule is seen in the paraspinal subcutaneous tissues posterior to the right T11 rib.
Bilateral pleural effusions and basilar atelectasis, right more than left, significantly increased on the left and slightly increased on the right.
Nonspecific hepatic hypodensity, largely unchanged.
Unchanged left-sided rib metastases.
EEG [**5-2**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG recording due to the slow and disorganized background suggestive of a widespread encephalopathy.
There were no lateralized or epileptiform features seen in this recording.
CXR [**5-3**]: Partially obscuring many of the large nodules in both lungs is a process which could be pulmonary edema or rapidly developing pneumonia, worse in the right lung and all new since [**5-1**].
Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed.
No pneumothorax.
Infra- and supra-tentorial areas of abnormal enhancement as described above involving the right cerebellar hemisphere, three lesions in the subcortical white matter of the right cerebral hemisphere.
Punctate areas of restricted diffusion noted on the left frontal region, possibly related with restricted diffusion versus metastasis, pattern of enhancement is identified in the lesions on the right cerebral hemisphere and cerebellum likely consistent with metastatic disease.
Altered mental status: Initially on vanco, cefepime, ACV, and ampicillin for possible meningitis but all were discontinued as his mental status improved with decadron.
His AMS was most likely due to increased edema from cancer mets seen on CT and MRI head, as well as from acute hypercapnia (see below).
Hypoxia: Had an episode of desaturation on initial arrival to the floor, probably related to progression of metastatic disease.
He was initially treated for possible HAP with Vanc and Zosyn, although CT was not suggestive of PNA and these were stopped.
His CO2 improved but remained elevated, suggesting a chronic component, possibly OSA given his body habitus.
He was started on albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers to use for shortness of breath or wheezing from obstructing tumor.
He was started on dexamethasone for brain vasogenic edema due to metastases, as seen on CT and MRI head.
Neuro onc and rad onc saw the patient, and he will follow up as an outpatient for radiation therapy.
Hematuria: Initially had a negative UA, but repeat UA due to initial culture being contaminated showed many RBCs with few calcium oxalate crystals.
This was repeated after Foley removal, and showed less blood, no calcium crystals, but a few uric acid crystals.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Physicians Health  Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Altered mental status due to hypercapnia Malignant melanoma, metastatic to the lung and brain  Secondary: Diabetes mellitus Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with confusion that was likely from poor gas exchange in the lungs leading to a high carbon dioxide level (CO2).
We made the following medication changes: - Started albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers to use for shortness of breath or wheezing.
- Started dexamethasone, a steroid to decrease swelling around the brain.
If you have difficulty breathing, headache, confusion, seizures, chest pain, fevers, chills, or any other concerning symptoms, please seek medical attention or return to the ER immediately.
