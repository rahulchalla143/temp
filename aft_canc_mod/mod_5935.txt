Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2195-12-23**]: Left frontal bony mass excision and cranioplasty   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 6164**] is a 66 year old woman with history of multiple myeloma initially diagnosed in [**2192-10-5**], which unfortunately relapsed almost one year following her autologous stem cell transplant with painful lytic lesions requiring radiation therapy.
In mid [**Month (only) 359**], Ms. [**Known lastname 6164**] developed increasing left arm pain and xray revealed a large lytic lesion in the distal left humerus with marked cortical thinning and fenestration, consistent with a large myeloma deposit with risk for pathologic fracture.
During this recent radiation therapy, Ms. [**Known lastname 6164**] was noting increasing nausea with intermittent mild frontal headaches.
She also noted increasing numbness and pain under her left jaw.
This was evaluated with CT scan which unfortunately showed progressive lesions particularly in the frontal bone with erosion into the soft tissue/brain/sinus area as well as new left mandibular lesion and a new lesion in the right body of C2.
Ms. [**Known lastname 6164**] was seen as an urgent visit today as she was noting increasing pain in the left lower rib area which started on [**2195-12-17**].
The pain hurts with any movement and with inspiration.
With movement, the pain radiates to the left side and back area.
She does not complain of shortness of breath.
She is taking OxyContin 10 mg three times per day which is her usual regimen and has increased her Oxycodone to 4 - 5 tabs per day.
Her left arm pain has improved with the radiation therapy.
She also has had increasing nausea with daily vomiting.
She tends towards constipation and takes stool softeners.
cough, congestion or other respiratory symptoms.
She continues with her neuropathies of the feet which is stable.
She has no increasing numbness or tingling or weakness of her extremities.
She has no changes in bowel or bladder functioning.
She denies any bleeding or bruising.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 6164**] is noted for increasing calcium and is being admitted today for further workup of new area of pain and hypercalcemia.

Hypertension 2.
Hepatic hemangioma.
S/p Removal of a granular cell tumor from the left medial thigh in [**2180**].
S/p IM nail for distal left femur fracture.
She is not currently working due to her illness.
GENERAL: Tired appearing woman, no acute distress, alert and oriented X3 HEENT: PERRL with anicteric sclerae.
Oropharynx moist without erythema, lesions or thrush.
There is stable, hard nodule noted on lower right.
CV:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs/gallops/rubs ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender with positive bowel sounds and without hepatosplenomegaly noted.
There is pain on palpation over the left lower rib area.
EXT: Trace edema of ankles/feet, L>R, which is stable from prior.
Left lateral shin (lower region) has bandaid over clean/dry/intact "boil" SKIN: No rashes/lesions BACK:  No pain along spinal processes or CVA tenderness.
Imaging: Unilateral Rib with AP Chest ([**2195-12-21**]): There is a remote healed rib fracture of the lateral left tenth rib.
No acute fractures are identified.
No dislocations or degenerative change is seen.
No erosions or lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
IMPRESSION: No acute fracture.
Remote, healed left tenth rib fracture.
CT sinus ([**2195-12-8**]): There are innumerable lytic lesions in the imaged bones, which have increased in number and size since the previous studies.
These are located in the superior left frontal bone, left frontal region, right parietal region, new right frontal lesion, right frontal sinus roof, left frontal region, new defect in the right maxilla between the zygomatic process and the maxillary sinus.
There is a lesion in the left mandibular ramus eroding the medial and lateral cortices and disrupting the mandibular foramen.
There is a lesion in the left mandibular body eroding the buccal cortex and disrupting the mental foramen.
In the cervical spine, there is a new lytic lesion measuring 9 mm in the right body of C2, which abuts but does not appear to erode the posterior cortex (Image 2:132).
The previously noted lytic lesion in the clivus demonstrates slight interval enlargement.
IMPRESSION: Progression of innumerable destructive lytic osseous lesions, as described above, compatible with the known multiple myeloma.
Stable mild kyphosis of the thoracic spine with stable compression fractures of two upper thoracic vertebral bodies.
Multiple lucent lesions in the thoracic spine, likely due to multiple myeloma.
No evidence of fracture impinging on the spinal canal.
CT is not sensitive for intrathecal details.
If there is concern for radiculopathy, MRI is more sensitive for assessment of acute component of fractures or marrow edema.
Compression fracture involving the superior endplate of L1, new since the prior plain radiograph from [**2195-3-19**], but stable since [**2195-12-21**].
There is approximately 25% loss of height, without evidence of retropulsion of the dorsal cortex, spinal canal compromise or compression of the thecal sac.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 yo F with multiple myeloma, recurrent after autologous transplant, radiation and systemic therapy who is being admitted with worsening pain, hypercalcemia and concern for new bone lesions.
# Multiple Myeloma: Patient has a long history of multiple myeloma which unfortunately relapsed almost one year following her autologous stem cell transplant with painful lytic lesions requiring radiation therapy.
She now has new lesions in her skull and sinuses and mandible and was due for possible surgery on Wednesday [**2195-12-23**].
She is now noted to have new lower rib pain radiating to the side and back.
Given her history, the concern is for new lytic lesions and possible compression fractures (referred pain).
She has not been eating well due to nausea and vomiting.
She has had this on hold due to her recent events.
Patient has not had constipation, abdominal pain, hematuria (nephrolithiasis), mood changes with her hypercalcemia.
Neurosurgery felt that no emergent vertebroplasty was necessary given her lack of concerning symptoms and the <20% decrease in spine height on imaging.
Radiation Oncology also saw patient and given Neurosurgery's recs, they agreed to do radiation therapy to the thoracic compression sites in addition to her rib and cranial lesions at her next outpatient sessions with RadOnc a few weeks after the craniotomy (to allow for healing first).
Patient was started on Dexamethasone for hypercalcemia of malignancy as well as prevention/management of concern for cord compression.
- Patient preented with hypercalcemia likely due to multiple myeloma.
She was no longer hypercalcemic on the second day of hospitalization and remained within normal limits.
- Pain was initially managed with home Oxycontin and new PO Dilaudid for breakthrough pain.
When she continued to suffer significant rib and cranial pain s/p craniotomy, her Oxycontin was increased to 20mg TID and patient sent home with PO Dilaudid.
She was also given compazine/zofran as needed for nausea.
UTI: There was concern for a urinary tract infection given fevers and Foley X2 days after Neurosurgery took patient to [**Hospital Ward Name 12837**] for craniotomy.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for constipation.

Vital signs stable.
Patient ambulating and taking PO; pain controlled   Discharge Instructions: -You were admitted with high levels of calcium in your blood.
You were also found to have compression fractures in your spine due to the multiple myeloma.

We made the following changes to your medications during this admission: --> RESUME Lisinopril and Amlodipine now that the surgery is done --> INCREASE Oxycontin to 20mg every 8 hours --> CONTINUE Levofloxacin 750mg daily for 1 more day (Last day: [**Month (only) 2974**], [**1-1**]) --> START Dilaudid 2-4 mg by mouth every 4 hours as needed for pain --> START Ondansetron 8mg by mouth every 8 hours as needed for nausea/vomiting .
Also seek medical attention if you develop any new fever, chills, trouble breathing, chest pain, nausea, vomiting or unusual stools.
