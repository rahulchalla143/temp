History of Present Illness: HPI: The pt is a 54 year-old right-handed man who presents with confusion and new left parietal mass.
Head CT was done which shows left parietal mass with surrounding edema and intratumoral hemorrhage.
He has had poor sleep for the past month as well.
On neuro ROS, the pt denies headache, loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty.
Denies difficulties producing or comprehending speech.
No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.
On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or chills.
No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain.
He has had cough for a few days.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, poor dentition Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Difficulty naming low frequency objects.
There was no evidence of apraxia or neglect.
No pronator drift bilaterally.
No adventitious movements, such as tremor, noted.
No asterixis noted.
-Coordination: No dysmetria on FNF bilaterally.
Near-complete resorption of large left parietal hemorrhage, with residual cystic cavity and no evidence of underlying masses.
The presumed etiology is either hypertensive bleed or a ruptured vascular malformation which has involuted, and is no longer visualized.
Chronic opacification of right frontal sinus, with T1-hyperintense material suggesting inspissated secretions or fungal infection.
MRI [**2132-3-14**] IMPRESSION: Interval partial resorption of the left parietal hematoma and stable ventricular dimension without evidence of new hemorrhage or infarction.
No evidence of a mass lesion.
6.4x6.0cm area of mixed signal intensity in the left parietal lobe representing acute-subacute hematoma with mild-to-moderate surrounding edema noted.
While there are no large areas of abnormal enhancement, underlying causes include small mass/vascular lesion within or hemorrhagic infarct or amyloid angiopathy(less likely given the patient's age and lack of micorhemorrhages elsewhere).
Decreased signal in the distal vertebral and the Basilar artery as described above.
He was admitted with a large left parietal hemorrhage requiring Metoprolol and agressive blood pressure control.
He also had seizures and was started on Keppra.
Patient has continued to have cognitive dysfunction regarding his overall orientation.
The patient was originally started on Dexamethasone due to concern for mass underlying bleed.
HCTZ was also started, however was switched to Lisinopril due to hyponatremia.
Keppra was given for seizure prophylaxis.
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 1356**] had a period in the middle of [**Month (only) **] when he had started to refuse medications, and he had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure along with a hypertensive episode into the 200's.
He soon recovered on the floor, and continued to take his PO medications, without further seizures or hypertension greater than 150's.
There was no evidence of mass on initial and repeat MRI.
Subsequent brain MRI [**4-25**] showed near-complete resorption of large left parietal hemorrhage, with residual cystic cavity and no evidence of underlying masses.
Mr. [**Known lastname 4643**] had transient hyponatremia thought to be due to primary polydipsia and HCTZ.
Hyponatremia resolved.
Mr. [**Known lastname 4643**] was found to have thyroid nodules on chest CT scan.
A thyroid ultrasound showed calcification of one left thyroid nodule.
6. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
9. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions:  You were admitted to the hospital due to altered mental status and found to have a left sided parietal hemmorhage though to be secondary to hypertension.
You had several brain MRIs which did not show evidence of an underlying tumor.
However, you developed low sodium.
You were found to have thyroid nodules.
