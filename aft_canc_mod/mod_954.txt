Admission Date:  [**2188-2-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2188-2-11**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12**] Chief Complaint: Hematemesis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endoscopy with clips, epinephrine injection, and Bicap thermal therapy to site of bleeding gastric ulcers.
History of Present Illness: 84M with lymphoma s/p CHOP last week, h/o GIB, dilated CMP, who originally presented from home with hematemesis x2, after taking high dose prednisone during chemotherapy as well as Bufrin for arthritis.
Patient denied melena, abdominal pain, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, chills or chest pain.
In the MICU, patient had endoscopy showing multiple gastric ulcers, which were clipped, injected with epinephrine, and Bicapped.
Patient was also found to have an evolving STEMI, with isolated ST elevation in V3, as well as CE with peak troponin of 1.48 on [**2188-2-6**].
Patient remained chest pain free.
Originally felt to be a small lymphocytic lymphoma but new, more aggressive behavior is suggestive of NHL.
Chronic afib, has refused coumadin in past for side effects 4.
HTN 5.
Hearing loss 10.
ARF from hydronephrosis due to lymphoma   Social History: No smoking, rare ETOH, married, lives in [**Location **], former prof.  chemistry c hx exposure to organic compounds.
No cervical LAD.
No oral ulcers or exudates.
Guaiac positive in the ED.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include mid to distal anteroseptal and anterior akinesis/hypokinesis and basal to mid  inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis akinesis.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2187-12-21**], left ventricular systolic function is now significantly worse with new anteroseptal and anterior akinesis/hypokinesis.
EKG [**2188-2-6**]: Atrial fibrillation Ventricular premature complex Modest nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T abnormalities Anteroseptal myocardial infarct, age indeterminate - possible acute/recent/in evolution Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities Since previous tracing of [**2188-2-5**], further ST-T wave abnormalities present .
Mucosa: A salmon colored mucosa suggestive of Barrett's Esophagus was found.
Biopsy not performed due to bleeding.
Stomach:  Excavated Lesions Multiple ulcers were found in the antrum and stomach body.
A large 3-4 cm cratered ulcer with a necrotic center and adherent clot on the incisura was seen.
There was a pulsating vessel seen after the clot was removed.
Two resolution clips were applied to the vessel with persistent oozing.
No bleeding was seen at the completion of therapy.
Much of the body and fundus was not well-visualized due to blood and clot obscuring the view.
Impression: Ulcers in the antrum and stomach body Lymphoid hyperplasia in the duodenal bulb.
Small hiatal hernia An opening that is either a diverticulum or accessory duct was seen in the second portion of the duodenum.
Mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus   Brief Hospital Course: 84 yo male with PMHx sx for lymphoma, upper GIB, cardiomyopathy, who presented with an upper GI bleed with multiple gastric ulcers seen on endoscopy, likely secondary to NSAID use and recent high dose prednisone with CHOP therapy for lymphoma.
Patient was also found to have a silent STEMI, with V3 elevation and elevated CE.
Patient was transfused several units while in the MICU for hematocrit drop from 29.9 to 20.8 on presentation.
An emergent upper endoscopy demonstrated ulcers in the antrum and stomach body, lymphoid hyperplasia in the duodenal bulb, and mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus.
Biopsy wasn't performed at the time due to concern for increased bleeding.
On transfer to OMED, patient was hemodynamically stable, but then began to have drop in hematocrit.
STEMI: Patient was admitted with initial STE in V3, but with a progressive rise in cardiac enzymes.
He was noted to have evolving ST changes since admission with peak troponin, and was diagnosed as having a STEMI.
A cardiology consult was obtained, and recommended stopping patient's amlodipine and digoxin, and starting atorvastatin, lisinopril and metoprolol, which were started when patient was hemodynamically stable from a GI bleed perspective.
Patient's cardiac enzymes were trended, and he was found to have continued upward trend in troponin to peak 2.24, with gradual decrease in CK and CKMB.
Cardiology was reconsulted, and felt that elevation in troponin was not an indication for cardiac catheterization, and opted for medical management.
Patient was not placed on heparin due to bleeding risk.
He was not anticoagulated for his atrial fibrillation due to bleeding risk, and due to concern for poor compliance as an outpatient.
A repeat echocardiogram was performed, which showed global hypokinesis and a depressed EF from 40% to 30-35%, possibly from stunned myocardium.
He remained on telemetry with no events.
He remained chest pain free through his admission.
ST elevation MI 4.
Lymphoma s/p R-CHOP 5.
Leukopenia 6.
Lymphoid hyperplasia in duodenal bulb   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: If you develop nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, blood in your stool, vomiting blood, dizziness on standing, black stools, chest pain, please call your primary care doctor or go to the emergency room.
