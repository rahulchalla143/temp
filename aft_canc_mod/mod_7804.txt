Admission Date:  [**2134-1-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2134-2-8**]  Date of Birth:   [**2063-11-12**]       Sex:  M  Service:  MEDICINE  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This is a 70 year old male with upper gastrointestinal bleed and alcohol withdrawal, transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] at the request of family and intubated on transfer for airway protection.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient presented to [**Hospital3 **] Medical Center by the family with concern for three to four days of multiple falls due to worsening balance, gait abnormality, intermittent slurred speech and word finding difficulties and expressive aphasia.
The patient denied any head trauma, loss of consciousness, dizziness.
Cardiac and neurologic review of systems are negative, although the family noted a recent change in his personality and increased alcohol consumption.
In addition, the patient noted black stool times one week, cough productive of yellow sputum times three days.
Chest x-ray showed a 7.0 centimeter lesion in the posterior right upper lobe, thought to be a rounded mass versus collapsed lung distal to an endobronchial lesion.
Head CT showed multiple small calcified ring enhancing lesions, with the differential diagnoses of metastases, syssarcosis or abscesses.
With regards to his upper gastrointestinal bleed, his hematocrit dropped from 26.0 to 22.0 in the first night with occult blood positive stool.
Upper endoscopy showed superficial linear erosions in the lower third of the esophagus, mild nonerosive gastritis and duodenitis with no erosions or bleeding.
He continued to have orthostatic hypotension.
He became agitated on [**2134-1-23**], requiring posy and restraints.
On [**2134-1-24**], he became hypertensive to 210/130, requiring control with Nitroglycerin paste and Clonidine.
Peripheral vascular disease.
High cholesterol.
Seasonal allergies.
Colonic tubular adenoma, status post colonoscopy in [**2131-2-27**].
Possible mild palmar erythema but no spider nevi or caput medusa.
The neck revels seven centimeter jugular venous distention above the right atrium.
The abdomen is positive bowel sounds, soft, nondistended, no flank dullness or fluid wave.
Extremities - good peripheral pulses, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
CT of the brain with and without contrast revealed hyperdense edema in both temporal lobes.
Hyperdensity in superior left parietal lobe.
Small areas of calcification in the right temporal lobe and bilateral frontal and parietal lobes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, this is a 70 year old male with new brain lesions, apparent lung mass with endobronchial obstruction, ETOH withdrawal requiring deep Propofol sedation and endotracheal intubation for interhospital transfer.
Oncology - As already noted, the patient was noted to have right upper lobe endobronchial mass on chest x-ray concerning for carcinoma, especially given the findings of what appeared to be multiple brain metastases no head CT.  CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed a large right upper lobe mass, two liver lesions in the right lobe, pancreatic mass in the body of the pancreas, read as principal lung neoplasm, with metastatic foci.
Head CT from [**2134-1-26**], showed metastatic lesions in the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes, with moderate edema, minimal mass effect and some calcification.
There was general agreement that head radiation therapy would be the initial starting point for palliative treatment.
However, because the family was able to communicate with the patient and actually saw some improvement in his mental status over the past several weeks, especially since extubation, they decided to hold off on head radiation therapy, understanding that radiation therapy while it could provide further improvement in his mental status, it could also have negative effect too.
Mental status changes - Once the patient was extubated, he initially was still quite somnolent, giving only one word answers.
The patient's mental status changes most probably can be attributed to his multiple brain metastases, however, it is odd that the patient did not show any focal signs even with a greatly limited neurologic examination.
Other sources of mental status change included high Ativan load with poor clearing, effect of Dilantin, Wernicke's syndrome.
There is also concern for carcinomatosis meningitis, however, given that the patient was improving, this was not worked up.
Head magnetic resonance scan on [**2134-1-31**], showed multiple foci of enhancement, edema in both cerebral hemispheres, posterior fossa consistent with metastatic disease, no hydrocephalus, mass shift, hemorrhage or left meningeal enhancement that might suggest meningitis.
FEN - Initially once he was extubated, the patient had a nasogastric tube.
Metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer.
Mental status changes, likely secondary to brain metastases.
