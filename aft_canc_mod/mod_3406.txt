Admission Date:  [**2149-3-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-3-14**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1148**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None.
History of Present Illness: 86 yo F w/PMHx sx CHF, HTN who presented from a nursing home with altered mental status after being found unresponsive, with frothy secretions.
Her CXR showed an effusion vs. pneumonia, and her CT head showed communicating hydrocephalus.
Mild LV dysfunction and small pericard effusion.
[**3-11**]: Alert, talkative.
Past Medical History: CHF HTN Failure to thrive Thyroid mass Pancreatic mass   Social History: Lives in a nursing home.
No oral ulcers or lesions.
No rales or rhonchi anteriorly.
2+DTRs symmetric bilaterally.
Imaging: CT head ([**3-9**]): IMPRESSION: No acute hemorrhage.
Regions of hypodensity in the right cerebellum and both parietal lobes could represent prior hemorrhage or infarct.
Left basilar and retrocardiac opacity, likely secondary to a combination of effusion and atelectasis, but denser areas of consolidation medially with peribronchial thickening are more suggestive of consolidation secondary to an infectious process.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Left lower lobe of collapse.
No definite endobronchial lesion identified.
Mild CHF/fluid overload with a small left pleural effusion.
Cardiomegaly with secondary signs of ventricular dysfunction.
CXR ([**3-10**]): Persistent left lower lobe consolidation and pleural effusion, consistent with the history of pneumonia.
Prominent left hilum, which could be further evaluated on a PA and lateral radiograph when feasible.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with probable inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis (views suboptimal).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-14**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion with no echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
Microbiology: blood culture ([**3-9**]): no growth to date sputum culture ([**3-9**]): contaminated   Brief Hospital Course: 84F Chinese-speaking with PMH dementia, CHF, HTN, goiter, and large mass involving pancreatic tail with unresponsive episode while at Nursing Home, likely precipitated by hypoxia/infection in setting of LLL pneumonia/lung collapse.
Newly-recognized atrial fibrillation with satisfactory rate control on once-daily atenolol.
Continue levofloxacin x total of 14 days  # ATRIAL FIBRILLATION 1.
Continue beta-blocker at current dose  # DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE 1.
Continue furosemide 50 [**Hospital1 **]  # PRESUMED CAD 1.
ASA, BB  # DEMENTIA/DELIRIUM 1.
Ambulate with assist as tolerated  # PANCREATIC MASS 1.
Bilateral pleural effusions with accompanying compression atelectasis and/or consolidation.
Narrowed airway at the level of the vocal cords as well as thyroid with possible mass at the level of the left vocal cord, laryngoscopic examination is recommended.
Multiseptated hypodense likely cystic neoplasm of the pancreatic tail (6.1 x 5.9cm in largest dimension).
There is a concern for a malignant neoplastic process, further evaluation is recommended.
Possible clot vs masses in left atrium, right atrium and right atrium/IVC junction, echocardiogram is recommended.
Echocardiogram did not confirm intracardiac clot/masses, LVEF 40% with mild global hypokineses as awell as 2+MR/2+TR.
Regarding pancreatic mass, "There was a family meeting including the patient herself and the decision was made not to pursue further workup as the patient was feeling well and did not wish to pursue invasive testing."
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 1643**] Center  Discharge Diagnosis: Left lower lobe pneumonia Delirium, resolved Atrial fibrillation Systolic heart failure Dementia Goiter Pancreatic mass   Discharge Condition: Stable.
