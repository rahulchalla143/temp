1) Resp failure- admitted to ICU ventilated , large A-a gradient.
Diff dx includes: Transfusion related lung injury vs acute pulmonary edema vs sepsis.
CVP was high, but poor response to Lasix, no evidence of high SVR, so cardiogenic shock felt less likely and story not c/w this diagnosis.
2) hypotension- unclear etiology, likely [**3-8**] sepsis vs trali.
Pt remains w/ low MAPS so propofol (initial explanation for hypotension) highly unlikely.
3) MDS- on admission pt was clearly undergoing transformation to blast crisis.
Electrolytes c/w prerenal etiology but pt requiring furosemide to minimize pulm edema given increased permeability of vessels [**3-8**] lung injur.
