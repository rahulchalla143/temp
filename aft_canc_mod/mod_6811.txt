Susceptibility will be performed on P.aeruginosa and       S.aureus if sparse growth or greater..       ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE.
For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.

This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to       hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..  FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2163-8-19**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2163-8-22**]):    NO GROWTH.
Left lower quadrant ascites and possibly complex fluid adjacent to the liver which could be due to hemorrhage or infection.
Portal venous gas better seen on recent CT. 5.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Multiple splenic infarctions as stated in the provided history, although given elevated white blood cell count, infection is not excluded  [**2163-8-15**] ABD CT: IMPRESSION: 1.
Calcifications throughout the remaining pancreas are consistent with history of chronic pancreatitis.
Thin, curvilinear configuration of fluid in the post-splenectomy site; is unclear whether this is an actual separate fluid collection or in continuity with the free fluid within the abdomen.
It measures simple fluid density and could represent a small post-operative seroma versus ascites tracking into the post-splenectomy site.
Small amount of retroperitoneal fluid, likely related to diffuse anasarca, without a discrete fluid collection.
Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis, stable.
Consider MRI if there is continued clinical concern and not otherwise contraindicated.
[**2163-8-20**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This tracing did not reveal any paroxysmal epileptiform activity.
While there were a few bursts of theta activity, it probably represents drowsiness.
There is also prominent beta activity which may be a normal variant or secondary to medication.
It was evident that the pt had peritonitis and was developing sepsis.
Pt was subsequently taken to the OR for an exploratory laparotomy where it was revealed that the pt had a splenic abscess that had ruptured.
[**Name (NI) **], pt remained intubated and required pressors for hypotension and continued to have volume resuscitation in the SICU.
Pt remained in the SICU for further monitoring of his respiratory status and was transferred to the floor on post-op day 5.
The patient arrived on the floor NPO, on TPN, Tube feeds, and antibiotics, with a foley catheter, and Dilaudid PCA for pain control.
Neuro: The patient received Dilaudid PCA with good effect and adequate pain control.
Delirium: Postoperatively  the patient has had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] periods of lucidity and confusion.
On POD # 13, the patient was found less responsive, with gibberish speech, and able participate in limited neurological exam only.
The patient underwent 24 hrs EEG, which was negative for acute seizure activity.
Pulmonary: The patient was extubated on POD # 2, he was found to have bilateral pulmonary effusions on POD # 3, which were secondary to multiple transfusions and aggressive fluid resuscitation.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched.
Wound was evaluated daily and no signs or symptoms of infection were noticed.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diabetic diet and tubefeed, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
