Admission Date:  [**2120-3-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-4-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2057-11-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 552**] Chief Complaint: hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Briefly, 62 yoF with h/o metastatic breast CA and prior hypoxic episodes, often occuring in association with anxiety (prior work-up with CTA and PE all negative), who presented with vertigo and O2 sat in 60s on home O2 monitor in the setting of recent paracentesis and first cycle of CMF chemotherapy.
She is able to ambulate and climb stairs with minimal dyspnea.
As per ICU Admission Note, the pt's oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19**], was reportedly contact[**Name (NI) **] and advised against further acute work-up for PE given the pt's recent negative CTA and similar presentations in the past.
ROS: The pt denies any fevers or chills.
No frank cough, wheeze or shortness of breath.
Endorses some low-level, diffuse abdominal pain, which has been somewhat long-standing.
No urinary symptoms.
Past Medical History: metastatic breast cancer -involvement of the peritoneal cavity, bone, lymph nodes, and skin -s/p lumpectomy and XRT -chemotherapy most recently with CMF (started [**2120-3-22**]) -prior therapy including tamoxifen, Femara, Herceptin, carboplatin, xyotax (experimental), gemcytobine, Xeloda, doxorubicin, and Taxol osteoporosis osteoarthritis s/p myomectomy for fibroids s/p appendectomy rheumatic fever as child   Social History: She denies tobacco use.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Physical Exam: Gen: Chronically ill appearing adult female, no acute distress.
Neck: Supple, without adenopathy or JVD.
No tenderness with palpation.
Chest: Slightly decreased breath sounds at bases bilaterally.
No murmurs appreciated.
Abdomen: Soft, moderate diffuse tenderness.
Positioning: Oxygen saturation checked x two with patient in recumbant versus upright position.
Pertinent Results: Admission labs:  [**2120-3-25**] 05:40PM   WBC-3.7* RBC-3.52* HGB-10.8* HCT-33.0* MCV-94 MCH-30.7 MCHC-32.8 RDW-17.8* [**2120-3-25**] 05:40PM   NEUTS-78.4* LYMPHS-18.8 MONOS-1.6* EOS-0.8 BASOS-0.4 [**2120-3-25**] 05:40PM   GLUCOSE-101 UREA N-22* CREAT-0.5 SODIUM-137 POTASSIUM-3.8 CHLORIDE-107 TOTAL CO2-23 ANION GAP-11  [**3-26**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**3-25**], there is continued opacification in the retrocardiac region with obliteration of the left hemidiaphragm.
This is consistent with substantial volume loss involving the left lower lobe.
Some pleural fluid may also be present.
Diffuse sclerotic metastases are again seen.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is markedly dilated The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Markedly dilated ascending aorta.
Moderately dilated aortic root.
Moderate aortic regurgitation.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale visualized on color Doppler imaging, although interatrial septum was obscured by the large aorta.
Brief Hospital Course: 62 yoF presents with hypoxia in setting of mild transient vertigo.
# Hypoxia: Pt's history of recurrent hypoxic episodes in the setting of ASD was concerning for dynamic intracardiac shunting (i.e., Platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome).
It is possible that factors such as the pt's volume status (orthostasis with systemic hypotension in the upright position) or mild auto-PEEPing the setting of tachypnea may alter the degree of shunting which occurs.
It is also possible that the anxiety the patient has experienced in relation to prior episodes may in fact be a manifestation of hypoxia.
Other considerations would still include pulmonary embolus, interstitial lung disease, CHF or pneumonia, however these appear less likely explainations given the reproducibility of symptoms.
She had an echo that was unable to visualize an ASD or PFO and did not demonstrated any elevated R atrial pressures or pulmonary hypertension.
Ultimately, she reintubated for another episode of hypoxia and extubated at the request of her husband/ HCP who felt that she would have wanted to be CMO at this stage of her disease.
# Tachycardia/elevated BUN: In setting of recent paracentesis and poor PO intake, patient was likely dry.
# Anemia: Consistent with recent baseline.
Normal MCV with elevated RDW.
No recent w/u undertaken.
# Pain: The patient reported abdominal pain, related to abdominal distention and paracentesis.
At home, she controls the pain with Tylenol.
She developed nausea in association with morphine, and this was managed with compazine.
# GI bleed:  On [**3-28**], the patient had an episode of hematemesis, was tachycardic to 130s, and had a large melanotic stool.
Medications on Admission: Tylenol prn  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Hypoxia  Secondary diagnosis Metastatic Breast Cancer   Discharge Condition: Pt died   Discharge Instructions: Pt was made CMO and died in hospital  Followup Instructions: Pt died in hospital
