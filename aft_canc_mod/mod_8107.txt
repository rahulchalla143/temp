She now presents to the ED with fever to 101 at home, without specific associated symptoms other than a mild bifrontal headache that has since resolved and some shoulder blader pain which she always has with her chemotherapy.
No neck stiffness, photophobia, naucea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cough, dysuria or rash.
Labs revealed a borderline low wcc of 3.6.
Following recovery, she received one cycle of maintenance rituximab in [**10/2117**] with a followup PET scan in [**12/2117**] showed worsening adenopathy with biopsy consistent with her known lymphoma.
She received high-dose Cytoxan for stem cell mobilization and collections on [**2118-4-22**] followed by an autologous stem cell transplant with induction chemotherapy with  a BEAM regimen starting on [**2118-5-19**].
Mrs. [**Known lastname 103705**] underwent a restaging PET scan on [**2118-11-11**] which  unfortunately showed interval development of a single 21.7 mm focus of prevascular adenopathy.
Given that Mrs. [**Known lastname 103705**] has a history of agressive lymphoma and clonal T cell process along with connective tissue disease that can cause benign adenopathy, we arranged for a CT guided biopsy on [**2118-11-22**].
The biopsy results showed high grade diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and polymorphic T cell dominant lymphoid population that raised the possibility of concurrent T cell lymphoma.
Atrial fibrillation, on Digoxin, Diltiazem, Metoprolol with rate control.
Was on Coumadin which has been on hold with recent treatment.
History of DVT in left leg [**8-/2116**], treated with Lovenox 5.
Hypertension 6.
Asthma 8.
MVA, [**7-/2117**] with bilateral C2 vertebral foramen fracture/C2 body fracture, manubrium fracture, right rib fractures of ribs six through eight, left distal radial/ulnar styloid fracture.

TTE [**2119-1-25**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2118-5-16**] the amount of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation have increased slightly.
Mildly increased interstitial markings at the right lung base are nonspecific.
There is no consolidation or pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is no hilar or mediastinal enlargement.
The known prevascular mediastinal mass is only appreciated with the benefit of prior CT. Mildly tortuous aorta is again seen.
IMPRESSION: Nonspecific interstitial markings at the right lung base.
[**2119-1-27**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Persistent right lower lobe pneumonia with new atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
[**2119-1-27**] LENIs: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.
No evidence for pulmonary embolus or acute aortic syndrome.
Bilateral, right greater than left, small-to-moderate pleural effusions with associated relaxation atelectasis are new.
No new focal pulmonary consolidation is identified.
Increase in mediastinal adenopathy, with a new enlargement of pretracheal and right hilar lymph nodes compared to [**2118-11-1**].
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 103705**] is a 68 year old female with NHL, s/p Pralatrexate and Gemcitabine, A fib on multiple nodal agents who was admitted for fever and right shoulder blade pain then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with pleuritic chest pain/hypoxia and bradycardia, then bacl on the floor, treated for pneumonia.
# Bradycardia: Pt became bardycardic into 30s the morning after admission.
This was likely secondary to over-medication with home Metoprolol, Diltiazem and Digoxin.
Patient remained normotensive and asymptomatic.
# Pleuritic chest pain/Hypoxia: Patient presented with fever and developed an oxygen requirement.
She denied cough or shortness of breath.
EKG showed no ST changes, ECHO showed normal LVEF, no pericardial effusion or significant valvular abnormalities and CXR was suggestive of pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
Finally, bilateral LENIs were negative for DVT and CTA chest (pt was premedicated for it given h/o allergy) showed no PE.
Patient was afebrile during stay.
Could be [**12-20**] pneumonia vs Gemcitibine.
# B cell lymphoma: Pt was s/p recent chemo (Pralatrexate and Gemcitabine on [**2119-1-23**]).
Pt was continued on medications for pain control.
Pt was continued on Bactrim and Acyclovir for prophylaxis.
# Hyperglycemia: Pt was noted to have elevated blood sugars, was maintained on insulin sliding scale.
