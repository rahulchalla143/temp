She denies headache and visual changes, but does endorse some neck stiffness after having central line placed.
No abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena, or hematochezia.
Pt does endorse back pain, which is consistent with her chronic back pain.

Findings suggesting slight pulmonary congestion.
Focal right infrahilar opacity of recent onset which may reflect atelectasis or potentially early pneumonia in the appropriate setting; if pulmonary symptoms are present then short-term follow-up radiographs, preferably with PA and lateral technique if feasible, are suggested.
Worsening interstitial abnormality suggesting mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular congestion.
Although an asymmetric pattern of pulmonary congestion could be considered particularly given rapid onset in the same timeframe, coinciding pneumonia should also be considered.
Satisfactory placement of central venous catheter.
-CT head ([**2120-3-1**]): No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
If clinical suspicion for an intracranial mass is high, MRI is the recommended study of choice if not contra-indicated.
More confluent airspace consolidation in the right lower lobe which is concerning for pneumonia.
Pulmonary venous hypertension without evidence of overt pulmonary edema.
No large left effusion.
No pneumothorax.
There continue to be streaky opacities at the left base which may reflect subsegmental atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded.
The airspace consolidation at the right base has significantly improved, and given the interval change, this would favor resolving atelectasis rather than an acute infectious process.
No pneumothorax is seen.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 year-old woman with extensive stage small cell lung cancer, COPD, HTN presenting with fever, dyspnea, and altered mental status, found to have pneumonia and C.Diff infection.
# Sepsis and pneumonia: Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 104577**] presented with fever, altered mental status, cough, tachycardia, hypotension, leukopenia,  She was found to have right lower lobe pneumonia on chest x-ray at presentation.
She remained hypotensive despite 6L of IVF and initially required pressors in the emergency room, she was subsequently admitted to the ICU.
#C. diff colitis: On hospital day #2, patient developed diarrhea which was shown to be C.diff positive.
# Hypoxia: Pt with known small cell lung cancer and recent admission for pneumonia in [**2120-1-14**].
Also with history of COPD but no wheezing.
Presented with cough, fever, and evidence of pneumonia on examiation.
There was evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR after aggressive volume resuscitation in the ED, however her hypoxia resolved after the first day of admission.
# Neutropenic fever: ANC was 286 at admission to [**Hospital1 18**], she was placed on neutropenic precautions.
# Chronic pain: Related to her extensive metastases, especially her large ambominal mass which extends from her liver to the upper pole of her right kidney.
She was continued on a lower dose of oxycontin given her initial altered mental status.
At discharge, she will resume her home doses of pain medications.
#Extensive stage metastatic SCLC: She had been receiving palliative chemotherapy and radiation at the time of presentation.
She did not receive any chemo or radiation during this admission and will follow-up with her oncologist as an outpatient.
As described above, her respiratory status was stable after her pneumonia was treated and she was breathing comfortably on room air with no wheezing on exam at discharge.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES -Will continue vanc/cefepime for 3 days after discharge via PICC line -PICC line to be removed by VNA after last dose of antibiotics -Should follow-up with her oncologist after discharge regarding management and palliation of her metastatic SCLC  Medications on Admission: Amlodipine 2.5 mg daily Hydormorphone 2 mg Q3H PRN Lorazepam 0.5 mg Q6H PRN Omeprazole 20 mg daily Zofran 8 mg PO Q8H Oxycodone ER 20 mg Q12H prochlorperazine maleate 10 mg Q6H PRN nausea tiotropium bromide 18 mcg inh daily senna 8.6 mg [**Hospital1 **] PRN docusate sodium 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] simethicone 80 mg QID gabapentin 600 mg Q8H   Discharge Medications: 1. amlodipine 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
3. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every six (6) hours as needed for anxiety.
