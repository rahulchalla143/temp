It also showed moderate to high grade stenosis of the left ICA.
Subsequent carotid doppler showed a left 80 to 99% stenosis and a right 60 to 99% stenosis.
Pathology of his left upper resection showed a metastatic melanoma.
The patient's multiple cutaneous malignancies were thought to preclude any benefit of further chemotherapy.
The patient was treated while in house with emollients and topic steroids for his mycosis fungoides.
