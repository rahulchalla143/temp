NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Left lower chest opacity likely representing left pleural effusion,with associated atelectasis; an underlying infectious process cannot be ruled out.
[**2177-7-8**] Lumbo-Sacral X-ray: Six markedly suboptimal bedside (& possibly intraoperative) radiographs of the lumbar spine with lateral images apparently obtained with cross-table technique lying supine.
There is possible displaced fracture of L5 vertebral body.
However, this appearance does not correlate with the history provided & fracture or destruction of this body was not seen on more satisfactory CT of this area done [**2177-6-9**].
[**2177-7-8**] R Foot X-ray: Minimal interval change with findings suggestive of distal 5th metatarsal osteomyelitis.
Probable secondary reflex sympathetic osteodysrophy.
No evidence of mass or mass effect.
[**2177-7-9**] L Foot X-ray: No definite radiographic evidence for osteomyelitis.
Marked osteopenia along the medial distal fifth metatarsal head again noted.
No obvious fracture.
Given the degree of osteopenia, subtle abnormalities may not be radiographically apparent.
Small, area of diffusion abnormality in the anterior right parietal lobe.This may be due to subacute infarct.
Gadolinium enhance study can be obtained if clinically indicated following consultation with renal service.
No hydrocephalus.
Remote suboccipital craniectomy with residual deformity of craniocervical junction.
[**2177-7-11**] Swallowing Video:  FINDINGS: Barium passes freely through the oropharynx and esophagus without evidence of obstruction.
There was intermittent aspiration of thin liquids.
Brief Hospital Course: 56yo M with DM2, PVD, CHF, chronic osteomyelitis admitted to the MICU for increased sputum, persistent osteomyelitis, fevers and decreased mental status.
Pt recently had a long hospitalization course for osteomyeltitis complicated by multifactorial respiratory failure s/p trach/peg, renal failure on HD now, new diagnosis of CML now on gleevac, and persistent AMS of unclear etiology.
Patient's symptoms improved, afebrile, more lucid, less secretions, and antibiotics were switched to Daptomycin and Meropenem, per ID reccomendations.
Patient will be on dapto/[**Last Name (un) 2830**] for 6 weeks (start date [**2177-7-8**]) followed by PO antibiotics for osteomyelitis suppression.
#Osteomyelitis: Pt has osteomyelitis of right heel as well as ulcers and infections of left foot and coccyx.
Pt found to have coccygeal ulcers and was followed by wound care with daily dressing changes.
# CML: Pt was recently diagnosed with CML in [**2177-4-29**].
WBC still continued to be high in the 80-120s with mildly elevated LDH (550-650) and elevated Uric Acid (4-7.5 range).
# Altered Mental Status: On prior admission, pt had AMS thought to be secondary to intracranial leukostasis from CML, although symptoms did not improve with leukoparesis.
# Hydrocephalus: Unclear etiology but patient has h/o spinal surgeries for meningioma in [**10-7**].
There was concern that pt had obstruction of drainage from either septic or malignant mass given complicated history of osteo and CML.
However, MRI done on [**2177-7-9**] showed no hydrocephalus.
# Pain: Pt had bony pain from leukocytosis assoc w/CML, ulcers, as well as chronic pain from neuropathies, meningiomas, osteomyelitis.
Pt was given dilaudid every 2 hrs and gabapentin for pain control.
Palliative care was closely involved in pain managment.
He was also written for IV dilaudid 0.75mg as needed for pain if he can not take PO.
He still had pain on this regimen but preferred to be alert.
# Decreased hearing:  Left ear's with erythema and pt reported some decreased hearing.
On admission he was noted to have increased secretions which decreased with antibiotics.
Stenotrophomonas thought to be more likely contaminate or colonization, given the sparse growth and reccurent positive cultures.
# Oliguria/ESRD/anasarca: Pt originally came in with foley which was d/c'ed for possible UTI.
At times he required neutrophos supplements for low phos.
# Coagulopathy: Pt found to have elevated INR and coumadin for A. fib was held.
Coumadin was held initially for an elevated INR and was then discontinued because pt has poor prognosis and end stage disease and history of GI bleeds on coumadin.
# Goals of Care: Pt was told if his poor prognosis.
He described that he felt that stopping HD would be the most peaceful way to go.
He is very aware of the risks of aspiration and pneumonia.
After that, he would like to stop hemodialysis and focus on pain control and comfort.
