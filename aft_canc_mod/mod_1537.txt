No evidence of bowel obstruction or free air within the abdomen.
Progression of disease with marked increase in pulmonary nodules and slight increase in mesenteric lymph node masses.
Unchanged left ovarian calcified mass and right adnexal/mesenteric mass which continue to be concerning for Krukenburg tumors, or mucinous tumors of the ovaries.
Increased ascites and inflammatory stranding within the abdomen as well as anasarca.
2)Endoscopy ([**6-7**]): A single ulcerated mass was found in the third part of the duodenum.
3)Colonoscopy ([**6-7**]): Multiple diverticula were seen in the sigmoid.Diverticulosis appeared to be severe  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 yo female with metastatic colon cancer presenting with BRBPR, hemodynamically stable.
She underwent an EGD which showed an ulcerating mass in the 3rd part of the duodenum.
Final pathology is consistent with adenocarcinoma.
There was no clear source of bleeding identified but GI felt that mass was most likely source.
She had 1 episode of melanotic stools.
GI was re-consulted and did not feel that she needed to be re-scoped since she was hemodynamically stable and there was no evidence of a brisk bleed.
Angiography was an option but was deferred since patient was thought to have a slow bleed and this study would likely not be useful.
Her hematocrit remained stable during the rest of her stay and she had no further bleeding.
