NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Imaging: CXR [**2177-5-20**]: Abnormal mediastinal and right hilum.
This is of unclear etiology and the margins of the right hilar density are atypical for mass lesion.
I suspect there is a large hiatal hernia, possibly intrathoracic stomach, which could account for the relatively atypical appearance, although this is difficult to confirm given the lack of lateral view and comparison studies.
There is a focal contrast-filled outpouching off the anterolateral aspect of the ascending aorta originating approximately 6 cm from the aortic root.
There is no associated stranding or mesenteric fluid to suggest leak or rupture at this time.
These findings highly suggest a pseudoaneurysm or possibly a very focal dissection.
There is a highly suspicious, circumferential, predominantly hypoattenuated lesion with relatively sharp transition zones both proximally and distally in a short segment of the sigmoid colon, approximately 5 cm in maximal length.
It is unclear whether there is a large right posterolateral bladder diverticulum or whether the wall thickening of thebladder is asymmetric and involves the anterior and superior aspects only.
The findings are highly suggestive of carcinoma pf the sigmoid colon with a possible contained inflammatory component extending to and possibly locally invading the dome of the bladder.
While the possibility of diverticulitis is entertained, the overall features of this lesion are much more consistent with that of colon cancer.
There is an irregular geographic area of hypoattenuation within the anterior right hepatic lobe mostly within segment VIII but also involving a small component of segment VII with small eccentric hyperattenuating foci most consistent with a giant hemangioma.
Despite the presence of an apparent sigmoid cancer, this lesion is not consistent with a metastatic deposit.
There is a large hernia anterior to the hiatus involving a long segment of the transverse colon which is relatively moderately stool filled.
There is no apparent obstruction.
There is incomplete left lower collapse, predominantly involving the basal segments with relative sparing of the superior segment.
Subsegmental atelectasis is also noted in the left upper lobe and right lower lobe.
No focal consolidation is seen.
There is no superimposed edema.
A small left pleural effusion is evident.
No pericardial effusion is seen.
Aside from the obvious lesion in the ascending aorta detailed in #1 above, the aorta itself is relatively ectatic throughout its course with scattered calcified and non-calcified atheromatous plaque.
Severe and extensive vascular calcification of the splenic artery is incidentally noted.
Incidentals: Small lipoma within the paraspinal musculature of the upper back, reference series 2, image #16, is noted.
A compression fracture of L1 with significant vertebral body height loss is also noted.
There is no posterior retropulsion.
Degenerative changes are noted diffusely throughout the thoracolumbar spine with multilevel bridging osteophytes are seen in the mid thoracic spine.
Numerous hypoattenuating lesions of the kidneys are present which are too small to further characterize.
There is a large exophytic hypoattenuated lesion off the lateral aspect of the inferior pole of the right kidney.
There is either a tiny focus of layering milk of calcium or possibly a small rim calcification noted.
A lumbar puncture was performed due to confusion (near his baseline) and a patechial rash on his shins, though it was negative for meningitis.
A CT torso was done in the setting of hypotension to evaluate a known aortic dissection, though this was stable.
It did show a sigmoid apple-core lesion consistent with possible colon cancer.
He was started on vanco/zosyn to cover potential bowel pathogens, with a translocation event suspected in light of abdominal pain on exam.
Other sources of infection include a right lower lobe pneumonia which evolved on HD2, as well as a urinary tract infection growing enterococcus on culture.
His levophed was weaned to off and he was extubated without difficulty.
# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Delerium is the most likely etiology, in this setting sepsis is the most likely etiology, though the patient is quite constipated on CT scan, and this could also precipitate delerium.
There is no evidence of MI, hypo or hyper glycemia or new pain or pain meds driving this.
# COLON CANCER : Apple core lesion seen in sigmoid colon concerning for colon cancer, especialy with guiac positive stools and anemia.
# HIATAL HERNIA:  Large hiatal hernia seen with stool-filed colon passing into thorax.
Moving bowels without sign of obstruction.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  Patient was in Afib and had episodes of RVR post-op.
# BPH: - hold tamsulosin in the setting of hypotension  # CAD:  On aspirin and plavix  # Dementia: - continue memantine for now .
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 599**] Senior Healthcare of [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Sepsis Colon adenocarcinoma Right IJ thrombus   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] initially with septic shock.
We did a CT scan which showed a mass in your colon.
The biopsies showed evidence of adenocarcinoma.
Your stomach was anchored to your abdominal wall, and a hernia in your diaphragm was repaired.
While in the hospital, you were found to have atrial fibrillation with fast heart rates (RVR).
You also have a thrombus/clot of your internal jugular vessel.
