Admission Date:  [**2179-7-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-7-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2105-5-17**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Ciprofloxacin / Zosyn / vancomycin  Attending:[**Last Name (un) 2888**] Chief Complaint: Chest Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2179-7-13**] cardiac catheterization [**2179-7-13**] intubation [**2179-7-13**] Tandem Heart placement   History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname 25586**] is a 74yo male with history HTN, DMII, CKD on PD, CAD, ischemic systolic and diastolic CHF (EF 15%), VT s/p ICD [**8-29**], recently hospitalized for NSTEMI s/p BMS to RCA for 99% occlusion of old stents([**5-1**]), and history of chest pain not relieved with recent stenting now presenting with chest pain.
Per patient pain started abruptly at 7pm on the night of presentation.
Pain is exacerbation when supine; no correlation with exertion.
Overall, pain very similar to pain that promted [**Month/Year (2) 12876**] in [**Month (only) 116**] when he got the BMS, and also similar to pain that promted ED presentation on [**2179-6-25**].
Pharmacologic stress test on [**2179-6-25**] demonstrated severe extensive fixed myocardial perfusion defect, similar in extent compared to [**2172**], with markedly increased left ventricular enlargement and decreased LVEF of 15%.
Also of note, has had intermittent othostatic symptoms and low BPs as an outpatient so has been off and on beta-blockers and ACE-I since stenting.
Labs with troponin/CKMB on presentation uptrending while in ED: Trop 0.27 -> 0.86, CKMB: 7 -> 22, CK 55 -> 207.
CT with contrast without dissection.
Bedside US with small pericardial effusion, EKG: no change, no obvious ischemia, L bundle branch block.
Patient then triggered for hypotension with systolic nadir in the 60s.
ECHO showed new mod-severe mitral regurg and new posterior wall hypokinesis compared to recent ECHOs.
On arrival to CCU patient was stable but quickly transfered to cath [**Name (NI) **] for intervention.
In cath [**Name (NI) **] occlusion found between left main and circ and stent was depolyed there, and coded with PEA shortly thereafter.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: +Diabetes, +Dyslipidemia, + Hypertension (also with hypotension issues with baseline BPs low in the 80-90s) 2.
CARDIAC HISTORY: -prior MI in [**2153**] -CABG: none -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: -> PTCA of the LAD and RCA, -> BMS to RCA in [**5-1**] for 99% occlusion of proximal RCA -PACING/ICD: -> s/p ICD in [**2175**] for VT 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Crohns Disease - Bladder cancer rx s/p TURBT [**2174-1-11**] - Lung adenocarcinoma T1 N0 s/p R VATS RLL lobectomy [**12-28**] for 3cm lesion.
Last Heme/Onc f/u [**8-/2178**] noted to have RUL ground-glass opacity persisting and growing in size.
Last f/u with thoracics [**2179-5-20**] thought that PET with  pulmonary mass and the paratracheal lymphadenopathy could be post radiation and inflammatory in the setting of fairly recent PNA.
Pt too frail to undergo pretty much any therapy (RT or chemo) even if these areas/masses are malignant.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF = 20 %) secondary to akinesis of the inferior free wall, posterior wall, lateral wall, and apex.
The inferior septum is hypokinetic.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2179-5-7**], extensive posterior wall and lateral wall akinesis are now present (contractile function of these walls was relatively preserved in the prior study), associated with a marked increase in the mitral regurgitation (previously mild).
No evidence of dissection or other acute aortic abnormality.
Similar appearance of the dominant spiculated right suprahilar mass, with interval resolution of the right apical nodular opacity.
Chronic small left pleural effusion with left lower lobe consolidation suggestive of "rounded atelectasis."
Stable-to-progressive lower lobe peribronchial cuffing, suggests ongoing inflammatory airways disease.
Small perihepatic ascites.
Atrophic polycystic kidneys.
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated two-vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had a 50% stenosis at the origin and a mid 50% stenosis.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with a RA mean of 34 mmHg, RVEDP of 33 mmHg and a PCWP of 28 mmHg.
There was pulmonary arterial hypertension with a mean PA pressure of 37 mmHg.
There was systemic arterial hypotension with a central aortic pressure of 90/56 mmHg on levophed.
Cardiogenic shock requiring multiple vasopressors and IABP followed by exchange for TandemHeart.
Severe right and likely left ventricular diastolic failure.
Severe left ventricular systolic failure.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 25641**] is a 74yo male with history DMII, CKD on PD, CAD, ischemic systolic/diastolic CHF (EF 15%), VT s/p ICD [**8-29**], recently hospitalized for NSTEMI s/p BMS to RCA for 99% occlusion of old stents([**5-1**]), and recurrent lung cancer with possible metastatic disease who presented with chest pain concerning for ACS due to new CK, MB, and trop elevations, new severe MR, and new akinesis of posterior wall and lateral wall on ECHO  Given concern for ACS and occlusion of recent BMS RCA stent (in the area of wall akinesis), the patient was started on heparin and plavix and sent for urgent cardiac catheterization.
Cath showed distal 50% LMCA stenosis with 90% ostial origin LCx and mid LCx 70% with layering thrombus.
He then complained of chest pain, became hypotensive, and subsequently experienced PEA cardiac arrest.
CPR and epinephrine were given, with initiation of IABP for hemodynamic support.
Repeat coronary films showed patent proximal LCx stents, thrombotic occlusion of the distal LCx and thrombus in the proximal LAD with slow flow, so these areas were then POBA'd and stented.
When he remained hypotensive despite maximal pressor support and IABP, the decision was made to place a TandemHeart.
Neurological status appeared poor, with fixed and dilated pupils and no withdrawl to pain.
Subsequent labs showed rising lactate, worsening acidosis (only transient improvements with bicarb boluses), and further metabolic derrangements.
