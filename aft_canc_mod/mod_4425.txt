Admission Date: [**2183-10-27**]        Discharge Date: [**2183-11-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2125-6-12**]        Sex:  M  Service:  OME   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 20728**] is a 58-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, admitted today to begin cycle 1, week 2, high-dose IL-2 therapy.
His oncologic history began in [**2181-12-28**], when he presented to the ER with difficulty urinating and pain, felt to be from nephrolithiasis, with imaging at that time demonstrating left kidney mass without metastatic disease.
Surgical margins were negative without lymphovascular invasion.
Given a stage 1 disease he was followed with serial imaging.
On [**2182-8-16**], CT scan reportedly showed no evidence of recurrent disease.
Followup CT scan on [**2183-8-12**], showed new pulmonary nodules, a soft tissue mass in the left renal fossa, as well as an enlarged retroperitoneal, necrotic lymph node.
PET CT done on [**2183-8-21**], showed avidity in the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes.
On [**2183-8-25**], he underwent a CT-guided biopsy of a paraaortic lymph node, which confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
During the week he received 11 of 14 doses, with course complicated by toxic encephalopathy and shock.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hyperlipidemia, GERD, status post tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, obstructive sleep apnea, history of erectile dysfunction, anxiety, and metastatic renal cell carcinoma as above.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Well-appearing male, no acute distress.
LYMPH NODES:  No cervical, supraclavicular or bilateral, axillary lymphadenopathy.
ABDOMEN:  Rounded, soft, nontender, no HSM or masses.
EXTREMITIES:  No lower extremity edema.
During this week he received 5 of 14 doses, with doses held due to shock and acute renal failure.
On hospital day #2 he developed hypotension without response to 3 fluid boluses.
He was placed on dopamine [**Known lastname **] pressure support but became tachycardic.
Shock was attributed to capillary leak syndrome from IL-2 therapy.
On treatment day #4 he was started on dopamine, given evidence of acute renal failure.
He had creatinine at that time of 5.1 with severe oliguria bordering on anuria.
He had mild metabolic acidosis noted that at that time, improved with bicarbonate replacement intravenously.
On treatment day #5 his urine output had improved, with a creatinine of 6.4, attributed to IL-2-induced acute renal failure.
He developed hyperkalemia early in his course, treated with Kayexalate successfully without any EKG changes noted.
Intravenous fluids were maintained given acute renal failure and associated shock.
Other side effects early in the week included nausea improved with antiemetic therapy; development of an erythematous skin rash; fatigue; and diarrhea improved with antidiarrheals.
On treatment day #6, Mr. [**Known lastname 20728**] was noted to be apneic after having removed his CPAP machine.
He was transferred emergently to the ICU with ABG revealing hypercarbic respiratory failure.
His renal function showed slow improvement.
During this week he had no transaminitis or hyperbilirubinemia.
He had no thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy noted.
On [**2183-11-4**], his creatinine kinase level was elevated at 256, with a normal MB and troponin level, felt to be inconsistent with myocarditis.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Metastatic renal cell carcinoma, status post cycle 1, week 2, high-dose IL-2 therapy complicated by height hypercarbic respiratory failure, shock, and acute renal failure  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lasix 20 mg p.o.
fever or pain, Compazine 5 mg q.i.d.
