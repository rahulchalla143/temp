Admission Date:  [**2173-2-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-2-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2096-7-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Doxil  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 76 yo female w/hx of ovarian CA dx in [**2150**] s/p TAH BSO, debulkining last in [**7-21**] resulting in colostomy and 9 rounds of chemo on gemcitibine prior to admission, HTN, CHF (EF now 35% but nl EF and clean c's in [**7-21**] cath), anxiety, PUD, ureteral obstruction s/p stents last on left in [**11-21**] who was admitted to the MICU after severe pulmonary edema after blood transfusion in Heme/[**Hospital **] clinic.
Pt was on regimen of gemcitibine for ovarian CA after poor tolerance for doxorubacin and routine labs in clinic revealed Hct 24 so she was she was transfused 2 units PRBC's.
She then developed respiratory distress requiring intubation in the ED.
She was found to have a small troponin leak to .10 and cardiology was consulted, but attributed it to CHF and recommended no need for cath or heparin.
TTE revealed apical and septal HK with an EF of 35% with most recent TTE   Social History: Lives on her own.
Family History: Sister has breast cancer  Physical Exam: T 100.7 HR 94 BP 99/76 AC 550 x 14 PEEP 15 100% o2 GEN: sedated, intubated HEENT: PERRL, EOMI CV: RRR S1S2 no murmurs Chest: left port LUNG: clear anteriorly, crackles r base ABD:soft, nt, ostomy in place, slightly distended, midline scar, bs+ EXT: no edema   Pertinent Results: ekg: nsr 99 bpm, nl axis, left bundle branc block, no st/t changes, no change from previous * cxr #1 b/l patchy infiltrates cxr #2 improved pulmonary edema, ett tube in place * Abdominal MRI [**2-15**]: 1) Extensive tumor mass within the lower pelvis, growing superiorly, resulting in bilateral distal ureteral obstruction.
2) Large suprapubic enhancing tumor mass as described, corresponding to the calcified mass detected on recent CT. 3) Incidentally detected deep venous thrombosis within the left leg.
* ECHO [**2-12**]: EF 35%, mild symmetric LVH, mild global HK and severe HK of septum and apex c/w CAD.
* cath [**7-21**]: nl coronaries, diastolic dysfunction * renal u/s: IMPRESSION: Bilateral nephroureteral stents.
Mild pelviectasis on the right,and more prominent pelvocaliectasis on the left, with additional multiple parapelvic cysts bilaterally.
In comparison to the CT dated [**2172-12-24**], the most recent comparison examination available, the degree of bilateral pelvocaliectasis is probably stable to perhaps slightly decreased.
She intubated in the emergency department because of worsening respiratory status and transferred to the ICU.
CXR at the time showed patchy bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema.
The patient had a slight troponin elevation to 0.10 but ruled out for acute coronary syndrome by CK and MB fraction.
Echocardiogram revealed an EF of 35% with global and focal hypokinesis suggesting an acute coronary event may have occurred sometime in the interim between her normal cath in [**2170**] and this hospitalization.
The etiology of the patient's CHF is presumed to be volume overload from the transfusion.
It was not felt that the patient would benefit from having a stress test or cath during this hospitalization.
The patient was found to be in acute renal failure in the ICU with creatinine to 4.6 (BUN 76).
U/S was inconclusive and a follow-up abdominal MRI revealed bilateral distal ureteral obstruction on HOD #4.
Given the patient's history of GI bleed on coumadin, the decision was made not to initiate coumadin for outpatient anticoagulation.
