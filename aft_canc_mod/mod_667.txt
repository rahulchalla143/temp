FINAL SENSITIVITIES .
No evidence of aortic dissection or aneurysm.
Large pericardial effusion.
This is concerning for lymphoma and correlation with hematologic profile or biopsy is recommended.
Bibasilar atelectasis with a small right pleural effusion.
Multiple diverticuli throughout the colon without evidence for diverticulitis.
Large pericardial effusion.
Small right pleural effusion.
No evidence for infiltrate.
[**12-2**]: ECHO: Inferior infarct with RV dysfunction.
Moderate to large circumfirential pericardial effusion with early tamponade.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and infero-lateral hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
There is significant (30%) respiratory variation of mitral inflow.
Regional LV and RV systolic dysfunction persist.
Moderate left-sided pleural effusion.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**12-9**]: CXR: Increased bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis .
[**12-9**]: CXR post-thoracentesis: Previous moderate-sized left pleural effusion is now much smaller.
There is no pneumothorax.
Moderate right pleural effusion, enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, and bibasilar atelectasis are unchanged.
[**12-9**]: ECHO: Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed with inferior hypokinesis.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Increasing, large right and small left pleural effusions.
Increasing lingular and left lower lobe atelectasis or consolidation.
Stable, less pronounced lymphadenopathy in both axillae and imaged portions of the abdomen.
[**12-15**]: ECHO: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Small pericardial effusion.
Pathology: Pericardial fluid: Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by a small population (2% of total events) of monotypic kappa light chain restricted B-cells.
These findings are consistent with involvement of pericardial space by the concurrently diagnosed nodal lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma .
Subclavian lymph node:  LOW GRADE NON-HODGKIN B-CELL LYMPHOMA, MOST CONSISTENT WITH A LYMPHOPLASMACYTOID IMMUNOCYTOMA (SEE NOTE).
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with  mid septal hypokinesis.
The  aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve  stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are  mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small  pericardial effusion (seen mainly around the right atrium).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 yo female admitted with chest pressure, found to have large pericardial effusion s/p drainage and also CAD with PCI in LAD s/p cath with 80% stenosis of LAD.
Also, found to have lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma with transformation.
# Pericardial effusion: The patient was found to have a large pericardial effusion with evidence of tamponade.
Equalization of her diastolic pressures and pericardial pressures were found.
The catheter continued to drain fluid without evidence of recurrent tamponade.
# Lymphoma: The patient presented with the large pericardial effusion, diffuse lymphadenopathy, fevers, night sweats and weight loss.
Subclavian lymph node biopsy revealed lymphoma and the flow was consistent with lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma with transformation.
# Shortness of breath: This was thought to be multifactorial [**1-27**] her cardiac disease, diffuse lymphadenopathy, anxiety, and bilateral pleural effusions.
She had drainage of her left pleural effusion on [**12-9**] with removal of 1200cc.
Flow demonstrated diffuse large B cells in the fluid.
Her exam was consistent with fluid overload (elevated JVP and periph edema) so we aggressively treated with lasix.
# Cards Vasc: The patient's initial chest pain and ST elevations in inferior leads were concerning for acute infart.
She underwent cardiac cath which revealed significant stenosis in the LAD which was stented with a drug eluting stent.
# Cards Pump: A post-cath echo showed good cardiac function.
However, followup echocardiograms demonstrated an EF of 50% in the setting of mod/severe MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] SOB, as above, was thought to be partially related to her poor cardiac function.
# Cards rhythm: The patient did develop atrial fibrillation while in the CCU.
As there was concern for anticoagulating her with the potential chemotherapy and pericardial window, attempt was made for cardioversion.
She underwent DC cardioversion and had successful return of sinus rhythm with one attempt.
# Anxiety: The patient has a long history of anxiety and has been receiving effexor xr and risperidone which she continued as in inpatient with prn ativan as well.
# Hyponatremia: The patient developed hyponatremia while in the hospital.
The serum and urine studies were consistent with a component of SIADH and a component of pre-renal physiology.
CT Chest showed worsening lymphadenopathy.
In addition, on [**12-19**], she started c/o RUE numbness and achiness, which she states has been bothering her since prior to admission.
It was felt that there was a component of muscle spams and tense shoulders contributing to her pain.
Her pain improved by [**12-12**] and switched to PO pain meds.
If pain persists, call 911 or doctor.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every 6-8 hours as needed for pain for 3 days.
[**Last Name (Titles) **]:*10 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma with transformation - cardiac tamponade - CHF - atrial fibrillation (s/p DC cardioversion) - anxiety/depression - bilateral pleural effusions - pneumonia - hyponatremia Secondary: - hx of substance abuse   Discharge Condition: fair   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pain.
You had fluid around your heart which was relieved with a drain.
You also had evidence of a heart blockage so you had a stent placed.
You were diagnosed with lymphoma so received treatment with chemotherapy.
Please contact your oncologist if you experience a fever or chills.
Please go to the emergency department urgently if you experience shortness of breath, chest pain, or syncope.
