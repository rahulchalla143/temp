Hyperdense appearance of the left cerebellar lesion as well as the left frontal lobe lesion are likely due to component of hemorrhage.
There is a large amount of surrounding vasogenic edema particularly in the left cerebellar hemisphere causing mild compression of the fourth ventricle with increased dilation of the third ventricle, now measuring 8 mm compared to 5 mm on the prior study.
This is concerning for development of obstructive hydrocephalus.
There is no evidence of large territorial infarct, shift of midline structures or downward herniation.
Multiple supratentorial and infratentorial metastatic lesions as seen on recent MR with possible component of hemorrhage in the left cerebellar and left frontal lesions.
Compression of the fourth ventricle causing increased dilation of third ventricle and mild hydrocephalus.
MRI brain with contrast [**2151-8-12**] FINDINGS:  Again noted are numerous intracranial enhancing lesions, of various sizes, compatible with the known extensive intracranial metastases.
The dominant lesion in the posterior fossa measures 3.5 x 3.0 cm (image 2:6) in the left cerebellum, compared to 3.4 x 2.9 cm on [**2151-7-27**], essentially unchanged.
The dominant supratentorial lesion is noted in the left frontal lobe, measures 2.6 x 1.9 cm (image 3:13) compared to 2.6 x 1.8 cm, also unchanged.
There are also multiple smaller enhancing lesions scattered through the hemispheres and cerebella bilaterally.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
IMPRESSION:  Unchanged numerous intracranial metastases, with the dominant lesions in the left cerebellum and left frontal lobe.
CT head [**2151-8-12**] FINDINGS:  Since the previous MRI this morning, the patient is status post cranioplasty in the left posterior fossa.
There is no significant change in the mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
There is no hydrocephalus or hematoma.
No change in the multiple supratentorial metastatic lesions as seen on the recent MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
CONCLUSION:  No change in the mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
Status post left posterior fossa cranioplasty for resection of left cerebellar mass with air and blood products within the surgical bed and with similar degree of mass effect on the fourth ventricle, left mesencephalic cistern, medulla and left ambient cistern.
Intrinsic T1 hyperintensity limits evaluation for residual tumor.
Recommend follow up post resolution of blood products.
Small focus of slow diffusion along the periphery of the surgical bed may represent infarct.
Multiple supratentorial and infratentorial lesions as before, largest in the left frontal lobe is similar in size compared to the most recent prior examination.
CT head [**2151-8-13**] IMPRESSION:  Status post left frontal and posterior carinal fossa craniotomies with expected post-surgical gas and fluid within the resection bed and middle blood products; stable appearance of mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
MRI brain [**2151-8-14**] IMPRESSION: Status post left frontal and posterior cranial fossa craniotomy with expected post-surgical changes and gas, fluid within the resection bed.
Stable appearance of mass effect in the fourth ventricle.
Unchanged bilateral enhancing lesions consistent with previously known metastatic disease.
LUE dopplers [**2151-8-15**] Non-occlusive thrombus of the left axillary and basilic veins.
CT Head [**2151-8-16**] Interval improvement of the post-surgical changes at the left frontal lobe.
Stable post-surgical changes at the left cerebellar hemisphere with mild to moderate mass effect on the fourth ventricle, unchanged from the prior study on [**8-13**].
She was transferred to the neurosurgery service and on [**8-12**] she underwent a posterior fossa  craniotomy for tumor resection, post operatively patient remained intubated and was transferred to the ICU.
A posrtoperative CT scan and MRI scan showed expected post-op changes.
On [**8-15**], patient was clinically ready for transfer but new LUE swelling was noted.
The patient also had some left sided facial swelling that extended down the face.
Patient also was tachycardiac and Lopressor was started.
LUE dopplers were ordered and showed thrombus in the LUE at the axillary/basilic.
The patient continued to work with physical therapy and expressed readiness for discharge.
The patient will require further radiation treatment for her metastasis with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3929**], scheduled for [**2151-8-30**].

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**7-13**] days (from your date of surgery) for a wound check.
