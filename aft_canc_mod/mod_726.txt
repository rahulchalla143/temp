Admission Date:  [**2183-2-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2183-2-10**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain, hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: The patient is an 87 yo F with metastatic lung CA refractory to chemo, hx breast CA, COPD, recent admission for demand ischemia who presented with complaints of heart burn.
The patient has a history of lung CA and followed Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17535**], and has undergone partial wedge ressection, chemo, and XRT with continued disease progression.
She has had recent mild COPD flares, with symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea, and wheezes, with improvement on a prednisone taper.
Cardiac makers were cycled due to precordial TWI, with a midly elevated troponin I at 1.10.
She was transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization, which showed no focal lesions.
Her elevated cardiac markers were attributed to demand ischemia, and she was treated through medical management.
Over the last three days, she has been experiencing increasing fatigue, nausea, and decreased appetite.
She denies any frank chest pain, shortness of breath from baseline, fevers.
Similar to prior, she endorses symptoms of fatigue and a non-productive cough.
Past Medical History: - nonsmall cell lung cancer, s/p lung surgery x 2, chemo and radiation (last Chemo on [**2182-6-15**]) - h/o breast ca on right s/p lumpectomy, no further treatment - COPD - hypothyroidism - hyperlipidemia - hypertension - chronic headaches - mitral regurgitation - [**Date Range 499**] polyps - GERD - anemia - hyperglycemia (secondary to steroid use) - caridac demand ischemia with cath [**12-23**] with 2 vessel non-obsructive CAD.
She is a widow and has no children.
Family History: Twin sister with lung cancer, other sister with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer, two others with cardiac disease; one brother with cardiac disease and one with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer; mother w/ cardiac disase and father died of PNA.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
NECK: Supple, No LAD, No thyromegaly.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
JVP= flat LUNGS: Diffuse End-Expiratory Wheezes.
No HSM EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no mass/thrombus in the right ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
There is borderline resting sinus tachycardia.
Possible prior inferior myocardial infarction.
Non-specific ST-T wave change.
New increased area of opacity in the left upper lobe may represent pneumonia or progression of neoplastic disease.
Multifocal ill-defined pulmonary opacities represent patient's known metastatic lung cancer.
[**2183-2-7**] PA & LAT CXR - Nevertheless, the pre-existing bilateral opacities, likely to represent a combination of malignant and inflammatory disease, have increased in extent.
The cardiac silhouette is unchanged, the right pleural effusion is distributed in a slightly different manner, but its overall extent is unchanged.
Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 17536**] is a 87 year old female with a history of COPD, CAD, metastatic NSCLC, who presented with chest pain, likely secondary to worsening GERD symptoms, and was found to be hypotensive.
# Hypotension: Hypotensive to 80s on presentation, but had resolved and remained stable with IVF hydration.
Most likely volume depletion in the setting of nausea/vomiting and poor PO intake, as well agressive antihypertensive regimen in the setting of 25 lb weight loss.
No evidence of cardiogenic shock, with normal TTE, no EKG changes, and essentially stable cardiac markers.
Additionally, no evidence of active infection, without fever, white count, and no concerning infiltartate on CXR.
Given her stable blood pressure and tachycardia with ambulation, as well as known CAD, her atenolol was restarted on discharge.
# Heartburn: Given recent discontinuation of PPI, her symptoms were most likely from uncontrolled reflux.
EKG was without ischemic changes and cardiac markers did not rise above 0.03.
# Shortness of breath / COPD flare.
The patient's symptoms were difficult to distinguish from those caused by her underlying lung cancer.
Additional possible etiologies for her shortness of breath include anemia and pulmonary embolism.
In discussing the latter possibility with the patient, she decided that if she had a pulmonary embolism she would not want anticoagulation.
As the patient's symptoms improved with transfusion and prednisone and she did not want anticoagulation, further evaluation for PE was not initiated.
There was no evidence of gross blood loss.
# Acute Renal Failure: Likely prerenal from volume depletion.
Her UA was without evidence of infection or intrinsic renal dysfunction.
# Non-small cell lung cancer.
# Hypothyroidism.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis - Hypotension - COPD Excerbation - Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with a low blood pressure and increased shortness of breath, likely due to a COPD flare.
Your shortness of breath has improved with treatment of your COPD flare.
