The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 16384**] for GIB, thought to be secondary to gastric varices, which are thought to be secondary to splenic vein thrombosis from pancreatitis.
The patient is a poor surgical candidate and so he underwent IR-guided embolization of the splenic artery.
After the procedure, he had low-grade temperatures but insisted on discharge, he was discharged with augmentin.
He presented [**12-7**] to his PCP with painful pleural effusion and pericardial effusion (no tamponade but mild right ventricular chamber collapse with mild right inflow variations with inspiration).
He had a CT abdomen at this time which showed enlarged spleen, showing fluid and air, consistent with liquefaction of the spleen, and his effusions were thought to be [**1-26**] splenic necrosis, his fluid analysis at this time was not concerning following the tap.
He presented to [**Hospital3 **] again on [**12-22**] with similar pain and shortness of breath.
Surgery at [**Hospital3 **] again tapped his pleural effusion lateral and just inferior to the left scapula, removing 1500cc of fluid with CXR unchanged after tap.
Also with post-procedure pain and fever to 101.7, peripheral WBC count of 18,000.
He was started on tigecycline (to cover for MRSA, GNR, anaerobes) and he had a CT of the abdomen with contrast, which showed a smaller spleen compared to 2 weeks ago from 19cm x 14cm to 13.9cm x 10.7cm.
Per report: the surgeon says that it is possible that he accessed the spleen during thoracentesis or another possibility is that the spleen formed an abscess which has entered into the pleural space.
Other findings on the CT: moderate left pleural effusion increased in size, small pericardial effusion decreased in size since previous exam, consolidation or atelectasis of left lower lobe, liquified spleen.
He was in acute distress reporting pleuritic chest pain and LUQ pain, but constant pain just worse with inspiration to [**9-4**].
On arrival to the MICU, Interventional pulmonary attempted to tap the left pleural space aspirated a small amount of thick sanguenous secretions and were unable to pass a wire.
Biopsy in [**2114**] showed fatty change, grade 1 portal inflammation and "focally increased" "portal fibrosis" (Stage 0-1).

Left lung is atelectactic with only a small amount of residual aeration at the apex.
In the setting of recent thoracentesis and recent abdominal intervention, the findings are concerning for a hemothorax.
Further evaluation by repeat thoracentesis and consideration of CTA is recommended, as well as correlation with hematocrit level.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
[**2118-12-25**] CT Chest/abd : Interval increase in size of left pleural effusion which causes contralateral mediastinal shift.
There is enhancement of the parietal and visceral pleural layers with regions of loculation and findings suggestive of multiloculated empyema.
Significant interval decrease in size of the intrasplenic fluid collection.
No change in loculated left pleural effusion with multiple small loculations with catheter in place.
Small amount of perisplenic fluid/hematoma is also unchanged.
New chest tube drain with subcutaneous axillary emphysema secondary to the chest tube placement.
Interval decrease in the amount of the left pleural effusion.
Stable appearance of the splenic fluid collection.
[**2119-1-2**] Lower extremity non invasives : No evidence of deep venous thrombosis of right or left lower extremity.
[**2119-1-3**] CXR : Interval removal of chest tube with no pneumothorax visualized.
There has been an interval decrease in left pleural effusion with improved aeration of the left lung.

Brief Hospital Course: 63 yo male with pleural and splenic collections, s/p thoracotomy, multiple tube thoracostomies, infected with Lactobacillus.
In the setting of HCV, pancreatitis c/b splenic vein thrombosis leading to gastric varices s/p splenic artery embolization.
# Large left sided pleural effusion with tracheal deviation: as seen on CXR done at [**Hospital3 **] (LGH) and at [**Hospital1 18**], the patient has large left sided pleural effusion, increasing despite 1.5L tap [**2118-12-21**] at LGH.
It is unclear if the thoracentesis done at LGH was fluid from the pleural space vs sample from the splenic fluid collection (fluid had pH 6.9, WBCs 25K, RBCs 13K, PMNs on gram stain, no organisms, inflammatory cells on cytology w/ no malignant cells).
Etiologies for the pleural effusion include empyema, reactive transudate, fluid tracking from splenic collection, hemothorax, or malignancy given recent 20lb weight loss.
Less likely heart failure due to unilateral nature.
Interventional pulmonology placed a chest tube on [**12-24**] and drained approximately 2L of fluid from pleural space (fluid had pH 6.78, and was exudative in nature based on Light's criteria, PMNs on gram stain, culture pending).
Repeat CXR showed interval decrease in pleural effusion with no post-procedure pneumothorax.
Thoracic surgery was consulted, and thinks the splenic fluid is likely from an abscess as opposed to sterile collection.
On [**12-26**] and the again on [**12-28**] the cultures of the pleural fluid grew for Lactobacillus.
This was consistent with the gram variable rods seen at the OSH's stain.
Infectious disease consultation was performed, which advised that the patient was likely inoculated by the first thoracentesis at the OSH, and given that there are now two positive cultures from two sticks, that it warranted treatment with Zosyn.
The current hypothesis is that the patient developed a pleural effusion that was subsequently inoculated with skin flora, and may have crossed initially into the peritoneal cavity, resulting in infection.
His pain was controlled initially with an epidural catheter and his chest tube drainage was minimal.
The tube was removed on [**2119-1-3**] and his chest xray showed a markedly decreased effusion.
Thus far his primary infectious sources include the exudative pleural effusion and splenic fluid collection.
His tachycardia temperatures soon normalized with a treatment of the chest tubes and antibiotics.
# Recent pericardial effusion: The patient recently had a pericardial effusion noted on [**12-7**].
He did not have it drained and echocardiogram at the time did not show true tamponade physiology but he did have right ventricular collapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
# Thrombocytosis: platelets elevated to 1200s here and at OSH but were in the 400s in [**2118-10-25**].
.# Chronic pain: Patient has a pain contract at [**Hospital1 1319**] Center for intractable pain secondary to laryngeal cancer and pancreatitis.
His pain is less since his chest tube was removed and he has remained afebrile.
Due to his multiple medical problems and lengthy hospitalization, rehab was recommended prior to returning home to help increase his endurance.

Discharge Instructions: -You were admitted to the hospital with fluid collections in your abdomen and chest.
After multiple drains were placed you currently have only one left which is draining a collection around the spleen.
You will be on antibiotics possibly until tht drain is removed but that will be determined by the general surgeon and the infectious disease doctors.
In the interim we are sending you for short term rehab to improve your strength and endurance.
-If you develop any shortness of breath, fevers or have any other new concerns call your doctor or return to the Emergency Room.
