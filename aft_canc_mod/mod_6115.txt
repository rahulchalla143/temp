He was initially evaluated at [**Hospital1 **] where a non-contrast CT of the head demonstrated a small right subdural hematoma.
He was admitted to the geriatrics service for evaluation of syncope (as a potential cause of the fall).
It is unknown if he suffered interval falls.
He was referred to the ED when the imaging showed acute progression of hemorrhage, which is now bilateral and associated with sulcal effacment and shift.
Due to presumed remote infarcts "in the language area" he has broca's aphasia.
Myeloproliferative disorder 3.
He reports no active symptoms.
He reports a stomach cancer discovered in [**2176**], which also revealed lymphoma cells on biopsy.
Bilateral hearing loss.
He does wear bilateral hearing aids,but is having some difficulty accommodating them.

MSK: stooped posture with limited head rotation  NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION: Mental Status: * Degree of Alertness: awakens easily to voice and maintains wakefulness without continuous stimulation.
* Language: Language is non-fluent with some paraphasic errors.
* Calculation: unable to calculate number of quarters in $1.50 ("4") * Praxis: No evidence of apraxia (able to mimic brushing teeth) * Frontal Release signs:   positive grasp Cranial Nerves: * I: Olfaction not evaluated.
* III, IV, VI: EOM with limited upgaze, without nystagmus.

There are low lung volumes bilaterally, exagerating the appearance of the hila and pulmonary vasculate.
There is a retrocardiac opacity, which likely represents combination of atelectasis and possibly a small left effusion.
No pneumothorax evident.
No overt evidence of fluid overload.
Retrocardiac opacity, likely combination of atelectasis and possibly small pleural effusion.
[**9-28**] Repeat NonContrast Head CT: FINDINGS: There is a hyperdensity along the convexity of the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes with some areas of hypodensity that is consistent with an acute on chronic subdural hematoma.
This extra-axial collection is unchanged in thickness, extent, and mass effect compared to prior study.
There is also a small hyperdense extra-axial collection in the LEFT frontal and temporal lobe convexities, consistent with a small acute subdural hematoma.
The subarachnoid hemorrhage seen in the left temporal lobe on prior study is unchanged in appearance.
The small intraventricular hemorrhage in the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle is unchanged and less dense, consistent with normal evolution of hemorrhage.
There is no new hemorrhage.
No interval development of acute infarction, edema, or herniation.
There is slight periventricular white matter hypodensity, likely the sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Bilateral subdural hematomas, right greater than left.
The right subdural hematoma along the frontal, parietal, temporal convexity is unchanged.
The left subdural hematoma in the frontotemporal area is slightly smaller in size.
No new hemorrhage or infarction.
Stable slight shift of midline structures without evidence of herniation.
EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the sudden appearance of generalized, rhythmic slowing suggestive of electrographic seizure.
Separately, the slow background activity with bifrontal slowing may represent the presence of a bifrontal subcortical lesion, diffuse areas of bilateral subcortical dysfunction and/or increased intracranial pressure.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] yo M h/o polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], HL, prior gastric lymphoma, suspected dementia and suspected prior stroke with nonfluent aphasia admitted overnight with increasing headache and somnolence, found to have interval increased in prior traumatic SDH (from [**9-22**]) with intraventricular extension and new SDHs.
The patient had fallen on [**9-22**] and suffered a head injury without loss of consciousness, resulting in a small frontal SDH.
Over several days, he developed a worsening headache and became more lethargic and sleepy.
He was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] and was found to have the extension of his prior hemorrhages and new hemorrhages.
He was kept in the TSICU overnight without any major change in neurologic status.

It was discovered that your previous subdural hematoma after falls weeks prior had expanded.
On imaging, it appears that the bleeding has remained stable during your stay.
It there is any large increase in sleepiness, there is a chance more bleeding has occurred and you should seek medical attention if so desired.
We have scheduled a pain regimen that seems to be helping with your headache.
