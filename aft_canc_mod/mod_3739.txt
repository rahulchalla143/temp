Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 3.
Chronic kidney disease (SCr at baseline 1.2 on [**4-8**]) 4. h/o GIB with PUD s/p gastrectomy 4.
Hypothyroidism 5.
Prostate cancer 6. h/o Subdural hematoma ([**11-17**]) while on coumadin 7. h/o Pelvic fracture in MVA ([**2133**])  Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco use (quit in [**2164**]).
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2179-4-10**]):  The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anteroseptal akinesis and apical akinesis/dyskinesis.
EF 35-40% No definite apical thrombus seen.
Mild to moderate ([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation.
[3+] tricuspid regurgitation.
Secretions within the bronchus intermedius with post- obstructive right middle and lower lobe collapse.
Associated endobronchial tumor cannot be excluded.
Narrowing right upper lobe bronchus by right hilar adenopathy.
Bulky mediastinal adenopathy is consistent with patient's history of malignancy.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with adjacent dependent atelectasis.
Mild interstitial edema and multichamber cardiomegaly.
[**2179-4-16**] pleural fluid cytology: Pleural fluid: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma.
[**2179-4-20**] pleural fluid: Pleural fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Mesothelial cells, some with reactive changes.
STEMI/Coronary artery disease: Presented with chest pain, elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes which were consistent with an ST-elevation MI.
An echo was obtained on HD2 which showed an EF of 35-40% and regional LV wall motion abnormalities which included: mid anteroseptal - akinetic; anterior apex - akinetic; septal apex- akinetic; inferior apex - akinetic; lateral apex - akinetic; apex - dyskinetic.
Given these finding, plan for 1 month of anticoagulation with coumadin was planned (no longer given the patient's history of a SDH and a GI bleed).
This may have represented decreased perfusion in the setting of his STEMI.
He had a small bump in his Cr to 1.6 in the setting of diuresis which then trended down and remained stable.
Records were obtained and confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma from bronhial washings.
He was evaluated by Heme/Onc staff and felt to be at least T3 although no formal staging was performed.
Oncology felt that the patient was too frail and deconditioned to undergo chemo/xrt and the plan was to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3551**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8631**] at [**Hospital1 **] as outpatient to discuss possible palliative chemo vs. hospice.
While at [**Hospital1 18**] a repeat non-contrast chest CT was performed that showed b/l pleural effusions and a likely R endobronchial tumor with post- obstructive collapse of the right middle and lower lobes in addition to hilar and mediastinal LAD.
Palliative care became involved to fascilitate discussion about palliative options and possible hospice.
The xray showed a cortical irregularity in the greater trochanter on the right which was concerning for metastatic disease.
During his hospital stay the patient had a significant oxygen requirement with O2 sats 88-96% on 6L NC and 15L high flow oxygen.
Chest xrays and CT demonstrated a large R pleural effusion with RML and RLL collapse.
Mitral valve replacement with severe MR: Audible murmur on exam.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Flovent and atrovent nebs were used, along with oxygen to keep sats in the 91-93 range.
for relief of chest pain.
If chest pain continues contact 911.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing.
Olanzapine 5 mg Tablet, Rapid Dissolve Sig: One (1) Tablet, Rapid Dissolve PO QHS (once a day (at bedtime)) as needed for sleep.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] Northeast - [**Location (un) 1110**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: ST elevation myocardial infarction adenocarcinoma of the lung hypertension atrial fibrillation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease hyperlipidemia hypothyroidism chronic renal insufficiency secondary: history of gastrointestinal bleeding history of subdural hemmorhage history of mitral valve replacement   Discharge Condition: fair, shortness of breath improved.
A pleurex catheter was placed because of your re-occuring right pleural effusion.
