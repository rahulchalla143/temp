[**2137-1-8**] MRI Brain-  Post-surgical changes as described above, with enhancing nodular area in the periphery of the surgical resection cavity and persistent mass effect and leftward shift of midline structures   Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 9973**] was transferred from an outside hospital with a report of a right frontal tumor.
CT head and MRI brain with and without contrast from OSH revealed a 5x5cm enhancing mass in the right frontal lobe abutting the right lateral ventricle.
