No intracranial hemorrhage or major vascular territorial infarction identified.
Large soft tissue mass within the nasopharynx, with associated osseous destruction as detailed, which is incompletely imaged and characterized without IV contrast.
If there is concern for intracranial metastases or an acute infarct, an MRI with gadolinium is recommended.
Acute/subacute left pontine infarct associated with high-grade stenosis of the basilar artery.
Large poorly-defined enhancing mass within the nasopharynx with permeation and destruction of the clivus with associated cervical adenopathy, better visualized on the recent neck MRI.
3 mm right ophthalmic aneurysm.
Markedly irregular right posterior cerebral artery with high-grade segmental stenosis.
VIDEO SWALLOW STUDY [**2166-2-14**] - Barium passed freely through the oropharynx and esophagus without evidence of obstruction.
There was gross aspiration with multiple consistencies of barium including thin, nectar, and pudding.
URINARY RETENTION, NEW SPINAL METS: Patient was transferred for evaluation of urinary retention because all of his care is at [**Hospital1 18**].
He was transferred with foley in place with good output and no evidence of acute renal failure.
There is concern for metastatic disease to spine given MRI findings at OSH prior to transfer, however there report with no sign of cord compression.
Urine output was adequate with the foley and no evidence of renal failure on labwork.
(see below)  # ACUTE/SUBACUTE LEFT PONTINE INFARCT - Mr. [**Known lastname 3443**] developed right sided weakness and confusion shortly after arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].
Neurology consult felt that exam was extremely difficult to interpret in setting of no interpreter available, however was notable for confusion, disorientation vs. aphasia and weakness in RUE w/o signs of UMN disease at time of evaluation.
CT HEAD was done due to patient's inability to lie flat for a prolonged period and showed no intracranial hemorrhage or major vascular territorial infarct identified.
Mr. [**Known lastname 3443**] then underwent MRI/MRA under sedation which showed acute/subacute left pontine infarct.
Discussion with the family at that time about goals of care resulted in change of code status to DNR/DNI due to poor prognosis.
Ultimately, patient clinically deteriorated in setting of no PO intake, recent stroke with aspiration on video swallow, and afib with RVR requiring diltiazem infusion.
# Atrial Fibrillation with RVR - Patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response after arrival from OSH.
He was unable to take PO due to his CVA event on the night of admisison.
He remained in atrial fibrillation throughout his hospital course.
METASTATIC NASOPHARYNGEAL CA: Currently undergoing second round of palliative chemo prior to the admission.
NG tube unable to be placed due to large nasopharyngeal mass.
