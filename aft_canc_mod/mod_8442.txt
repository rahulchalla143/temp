She was recently hospitalized from [**Date range (1) 102072**] for tachycardia, abdominal pain and a report of constant leakage from the ostomy site.
She continued to have exertional tachycardia.
She received her C32D8 5-FU/Leucovorin and the RN notes indicate persistent leak from the ostomy.
She presented to the ED today with a complaint of nausea, bilious vomiting and decreased ostomy output.
KUB did not have an obstruction.
She remained mildly tachycardic with HR of 105 at transfer.
Her labs demonstrated an acute renal failure, hyponatremia and anion gap metabolic acidosis.
She is slightly nauseated, but better than arrival.
She denies headache, blurred vision, mouth sores, chest pain, shortness of breath, constipation, abdominal pain, joint pains or rash.

Probable narrowing and/or stricturing of the colon in the region of the ostomy.
There is no definitive filling of more proximal loops of small bowel.
No evidence for formed feces within loops of opacified colon.
KUB [**2-11**] - IMPRESSION: No evidence of bowel obstruction or free intraperitoneal air.
There is no renal mass lesion, nephrolithiasis, or hydronephrosis identified.
There is symmetric renal parenchymal blood flow bilaterally.
The bladder was not well visualized as it is decompressed by Foley catheter, and there is significant overlying ostomy appliance/dressings precluding optimal visualization window.
IMPRESSION: Normal renal ultrasound, with no nephrolithiasis, renal mass lesion, or hydronephrosis.
RUE U/S [**2-20**] No evidence of right upper extremity DVT.
New large pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
No contrast flows from the small bowel to the large bowel.
Adhesions from prior surgery and/or tethering involving the peripancreatic mass might lead to some disruption in passage of contrast; however, the pattern of distention is most suggestive of occlusion and diversion at the site of fistula drainage to the skin, in a location anterior to the previous iliocolic anastamosis.
Residual contrast from the recent barium enema is seen within the sigmoid, with a long segment of descending colon unfilled and then in the upper descending colon and transverse colon again with residual barium, where a probable tract is seen to the body wall.
Possible herniation of fat into the fistula drainage/ostomy sites contributing to the obstruction.
Probable increased size of peripancreatic mass (limited without contrast).

Bili 1.3  Brief Hospital Course: 67 year old female with metastatic colon cancer C32D12 5-FU/Leucovorin presented with nausea, vomiting and acute renal failure.
# Diarrhea/bleed: During admission ostomy output was uncontrolled on imodium and TOP with lomotil and octreotide.
Cdiff and all viral and other cultures were negative.
Patient returned from the enema with her ostomy bag full of blood.
Patient soon developed fevers and rigors.
She was hypotensive and transfered to the ICU where she was given IVF and a short course of pressors.
She had been cultured, subsequently grew e-coli sepsis and started on Cipro/Flagyl then changed to Vanc/Zosyn, then Unasyn for 14 day course through [**3-2**].
Patient also continued on TPN with low residue/low lactose small quantity meals.
# elevated PTH: Odd in setting of nl corrrected calcium, possibly primary hyperparathyroidism without hypercalcium due to poor absorption.
# GNR bacteremia: Pt.
At the same time she became hypotensitve, initially unresponsive to IVF.
Patient was transferred to the MICU for hypotension in the setting of GNR septicemia.
She completed a course of Unasyn on [**2164-3-3**] and was afebrile after this.
# Acute Renal Failure - Liekly pre-renal [**2-14**] hypovolemia in the setting of vomiting and decreased PO intake.
Additionally, urine Na <10 consistent with pre-renal picture.
# Hyponatremia - Likely hypovolemia in nature as it rose with IVF.
# Dizziness - Likely related to fluid depletion in the setting of vomiting and decreased PO intake.
# Non Gap Metabolic Acidosis - Likely secondary to diarrhea.
# H/O PE/SVC Syndrome - Fondaparinux intially changed to Heparin due to renal failure and changed back around [**2-15**].
Patient then developed fistula site bleed so it was stopped on [**2-17**] and she was given protamine and started on TEDs/SCDs.
She was started on SC Heparin daily for prophylaxis given the risk of bleeding with Fondaparinux.
# RUE edema: On [**2-18**] it was noted that the pt.
# DM - Not on meds at home.
# CODE - Full (confirmed) # Communication: Patient and son [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 96530**] # Dispo: At some point in the near future, code status and goals of care should be reassessed with patient given her poor overall prognosis.

Discharge Instructions: You presented to the hospital with nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and decreased kidney function.
It appeared that your worsened kidney function was likely due to dehydration.
You also developed a blood infection and required a stay in the intensive care unit.
You were treated with antibiotics and the infection improved.
You continued to have increased output from your ostomy and you were evaluated by the surgery and gastrointestinal doctors.
