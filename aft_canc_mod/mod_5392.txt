CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2167-8-25**] 4:33 PM  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  Reason: please evaluate for perforation Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with severe abdominal pain s/p colonoscopy.
INDICATION: Severe abdominal pain post-EGD.
On the CT of thorax there is some soft tissue in the apices bilaterally which may represent apical scarring.
The pulmonary arteries are very large and the left atrium is also prominent.
The appearances may be consistent with pulmonary hypertension.
On the lung windows there is emphysematous change in the lungs and some scattered scarring.
Free air is also seen anterior to the left lobe of the liver.
There is intrahepatic bile duct dilatation.
CT PELVIS: Some free fluid is seen in the pelvis and extending to the right side of the rectum.
Several diverticula are seen in the sigmoid colon.
There is a high-density medium in the spinal canal which may represent previous Thorotrast examination.
IMPRESSION: Status post perforation from recent examination most likely secondary to EGD.
Free air seen extending into the mediastinum from the inferior esophagus and extending down into the abdomen around the liver and into the falciform ligament.
Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
Biapical scarring and emphysema.
Cardiomegaly and enlarged pulmonary arteries which may be secondary to pulmonary hypertension.
Free fluid in the pelvis.
Degenerative change in the spine.
Intra- and extra-hepatic bile duct dilatation.
Possible Thorotrast exposure in the spinal canal.
Valvular heart disease.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity.
Severe global RV free wall hypokinesis.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
Characteristic rheumatic deformity of the mitral valve leaflets with fused commissures and tethering of leaflet motion.
Moderate thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Left pleural effusion.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic deformity.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
There is moderate mitral stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**12-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
SURGICAL PROCEDURE:  Laparotomy, right colectomy and abdominal washout.
These have included a colonoscopy with BICAP of angiodysplastic lesions in the cecum, as well as removal of a sigmoid polyp.
On the following day, she had a push enteroscopy with BICAP of several lesions in her stomach.
She originally did well, but then developed the sudden onset of abdominal pain and had free air under the diaphragm, confirmed both by upright chest x-ray and CT scan.
She is complaining of abdominal pain with tenderness and has been given the option of surgical treatment.
INCISION:  A midline incision was made incorporating a portion of the old lower midline incision with another upward extension part way up between the umbilicus and the xiphoid.
There was purulent fluid in the abdomen, a small but modest amount.
There was a small amount of free stool spillage from a tiny perforation of the right colon.
There was another perforation which was even smaller, a centimeter or two away, in the right colon.
There were no other perforations that we could see.
We were able to suck out purulent fluid and find the perforation in the cecum, which was closed over with silk suture.
We also ran the bowel and found several small diverticula of the small bowel which were totally intact.
There was no injury to the small bowel.
It was my feeling that the best therapy here would be a right colectomy, in that the patient had a diseased right colon to begin with, and the cause of the bleeding most likely.
There was no evidence of leak.
It was noted that gas and liquid stool would pass without problem.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 4427**] had been admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**8-23**] under the medical service for a colonoscopy secondary to her inability to tolerate the oral contrast and a history of congestive heart failure and anemia, along with her age of [**Age over 90 **] years.
The colonoscopy demonstrated multiple diverticula and angioectasias which were cauterized.
The small bowel enteroscopy was performed on [**8-25**] which showed gastric angioectasias that were cauterized and duodenal diverticula.
She developed acute abdominal pain with peritoneal signs after her small bowel enteroscopy.
An abdominal x-ray showed free air under the diaphragm.
An abdominal and pelvic CT scan was done which showed free intraperitoneal air and perforation.
Ampicillin was added on POD 4 after a nasal swab confirmed Staph Aureus Coag + and was completed after four days of treatment and a repeat culture showing no growth.
Post-operatively she developed low urine output and hypotension and was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit.
Her creatinine was found to be elevated at 1.7 which was thought to be related to the CT scan contrast.
An echocardiogram was also done in the setting of her history of congestive heart failure, her central venous pressures of 16 and low urine output.
This showed her systolic function to be >55% along with mild pulmonary hypertension, tricuspid, and mitral regurgitation.
She had persistent anuria after Lasix, Bumex, and intravenous fluids.
Hemodialysis was also started on POD 3 by the renal service after her persistent anuria and a creatinine of 3.7.
After discussion with her family, the patient's advanced orders of not intubating were rescinded but the order of no resuscitation with chest compressions was maintained, she was intubated and mechanically ventilated on POD 3.
On POD 6 the dialysis was stopped secondary to an increase in urine output but was resumed on POD 7 after her weight was noted to have increased, she was anuric, and pulmonary failure was noted on chest x-ray.
The Levophed drip continued along with mechanical ventilation.
On POD 6 and 7 she was transfused a total of two units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 24 and 21 with no active signs of bleeding, with a good response in her hematocrit.
On HD18, she had an episode of hypoglycemia (40 mg/dl).
