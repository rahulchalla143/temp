Past Medical History: HTN COPD - used albuterol inhaler Metastatic Melenoma: symptoms [**12-29**] melena DX:[**2-4**] after UGI Bleed when endoscopy showed gastric mass, 2 moles on back bx and confirmed as melenoma.
STAGING: CT Torso - multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules with a dominant mass in the LLL.
PET-CT on [**2101-2-21**] was notable for FDG-avid adenopathy in the mediastinum and left suprahilar region, multiple bilateral lung nodules, multiple liver lesions, a lymph node adjacent to the pancreatic head, and an "extremely" avid lesion in the greater curvature of the mid-body of the stomach.
There was also FDG avidity in C2/C3 posterior elements, the right medial ilium, and the left inferior pubic ramus.
Limited by acute renal failure and dyspnea.
Prior to illness was the call center manager of a catalog company.

OSH Images:  ECHO [**2101-5-25**]: EF 55-60%, LA mild dilated with diameter 43mm, mild MR, mild TR, est PA pressure 22 mmHg, no pericardial effusion.
CTA [**2101-5-21**]: No CT evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Subcarinal soft tissue mass 8 *11 cm compressing left lower lobe bronchus with left lower lobe collapse.
Multiple pulm nodules and perihilar lymph nodes increased in size from prior.
New chest wall nodules worrisome for metastatic deposits.
Possible inferior myocardial infarction of undetermined age.
Generalized non-specific repolarization abnormalities.
[**2101-5-26**] CXR: Newly occurred partial left lung atelectasis with suspicion of central bronchial metastatic occlusion.
[**2101-5-30**] CXR: Persistent but mildly improved left lower lobe collapse with pleural effusion.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
[**2101-5-30**] Left Main Bronchus Tumor Pathology: Pending  Brief Hospital Course: In the MICU:  58 year old male with widely metastatic melenoma admitted from OSH, determined to be hemodynamically stable, treated with supportive care for his worsening dyspnea, fatigue, RUQ pain from liver metastasis, and new onset nausea and vomiting in setting of ongoing slow UGI bleed.
Dyspnea: He had progressive worsening dyspnea felt to be due to metastatic melanoma.
He underwent bronchoscopy and was found to have a left mainstem endobronchial tumor.
His follow-up chest xray showed increased aeration of the left lower lobe and the patient had subjective improvement in his dyspnea, although still had difficulty walking or exerting himself without become short of breath.
UGI Bleed: He has a known melenoma metastasis eroding into his stomch lining.
He had ongoing guaiac positive melenotic stools during this admission.
He had a slow hematocrit drop felt to be a very slow upper GI bleed.
Nausea/Vomiting: He had intermittent nausea and vomiting felt to be irritation from his bleeding in his stomach or possibly other tumor irritation.
Urinary Hesistancy: He reported urinary hesitancy intermittently that was felt to be related to narcotic use.
It resolved without intervention.
RUQ Pain: Likely related to the extensive tumor burden in his liver.
Metastatic Melenoma:He was given one dose of Taxol on the day of discharge after his bronchoscopy.
Tachycardia: He had persistent tachycardia felt to be due to underlying malignancy and pulmonary stimuli.
He was ruled out for PE on OSH CTA and had no effusion on OSH echo.
Fever: He had low grade fevers for the last 3 days of hospitalization.
He had no clear source of infection, but there was some concern for post-obstructive pneumonia given his known LLL obstruction.
Ambien 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for sleep.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Metastatic melanoma Left lower lobe collapse due to metastatic melanoma Upper Gastrointestinal Bleed   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital due to shortness of breath.
It was felt that you are short of breath because you have melanoma in your lungs that is compressing and invading your airways.
They cleaned out some of the disease from your airways and your breathing improved.
You also have slow bleeding from your GI tract, likely related to the melanoma that is in your stomach.
Your intermittent nausea and abdominal pain is felt to be related to this bleeding, as well as your black stools.
You also had low grade fevers and were started on an antibiotic for possible pneumonia.
