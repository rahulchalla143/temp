Admission Date:  [**2192-11-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2192-11-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2120-9-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: No Drug Allergy Information on File  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: ICH  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation and Extubation  History of Present Illness: Pt is a 72 yo female with h/o metastatic breast CA(currently undergoing chemo/XRT), HTN, chronic CA-related pain who is transferred from an OSH with ICH/SAH.
She developed a hematoma periorbitally on the right during one fall ~24 hours ago.
At this  point, it is unclear whether the ambulance was called, or whether her daughter who is a nurse arrived, but she was then taken to [**Hospital **] Hospital.
There, she was found to have a large ICH with subarachnoid blood and ventricular extension.
A repeat CT scan revealed similar picture to the OSH scan(have only seen report of that CT scan).
She has a focus of hemorrhage in the right frontotemporal white matter with extension to all of her ventricles.
It is unclear whether any metastases are present and she has no known brain mets.
Since arrival here, she has been unresponsive and without meaningful neurologic function.
Just completed palliative XRT to iliac crests in hopes of providing pain relief.
-Chronic Pain related to cancer -Known cavernous angiomas.
On MRI from [**2187**], lesions appear to be scattered in left cerebral hemisphere.
She is undergoing treatment for her metastatic CA.
No response to calling her name or painful stimuli.
Cranial Nerves: Pupils fixed and dilated bilaterally.
She has triple flexion to painful stimuli in legs bilaterally.

There is a right subdural hematoma along the convexity of the occipital lobe, with a parafalcine component.
In addition, there is a large cystic dilation in the right parietal and temporal lobes which appears to run along the surface of the tentorium.
There is an area of calcification adjacent to the left lateral ventricle, likely representing an area of old hemorrhage.
The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well pneumatized, apart from some mild mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus.
A large area of soft tissue swelling is seen over the right temporal bone and orbit.
IMPRESSION: Large right parenchymal hematoma dissecting into the ventricular system with associated diffuse ventricular dilation.
Moderate-sized right subdural hematoma along the occipital convexity and the falx, with a possibly cystic component as well.
These findings are associated with leftward subfalcine herniation.
Likely parenchymal and pleural scarring in the left hemithorax, although it is difficult to exclude a small left pleural effusion.
Once the patient has been extubated, dedicated PA and lateral chest radiograph is recommended to allow for assessment of stability of left apical thickening, which is asymmetric compared to the right.
Brief Hospital Course: This was a 72 yo female with h/o metastatic breast CA(currently undergoing chemo/XRT), HTN, chronic CA-related pain who was transferred from an OSH with ICH/SAH.
Her CT scan showed extensive damage and hydrocephalus.
Neurosurgery saw the patient and offered a venticular drain, with knowledge that it would not likely provide much benefit given the severity of her bleeding, but the family declined.
She was neurologically unresponsive, with no evidence of consciousness or brainstem function during our entire care of her.
In addition, she was no longer on any sedating or paralyzing medications that may influence our exam.
