Admission Date:  [**2151-10-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-11-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2081-11-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Ciprofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1363**] Chief Complaint: fever, chills Reason for MICU Admission: urosepsis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central venous line placement Left ureteral stent removal Left percutaneous nephrostomy tube replacement Right percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 16471**] is a 69 year old male with a history of bladder cancer s/p cystectomy with neobladder [**2145-4-9**] who has since required placement of left nephrostomy tube and stent because of ureteral obstruction (thought to be from recurrent cancer) who presents today w/ chills and fever to 101.9 at home.
He has had urosepsis in the past and treated at the [**Hospital 882**] Hospital this past summer.
He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 261**] [**10-8**] with the plan to work the patient up for possible metastatic bladder cancer and ?mass at mid L ureter (he has a MR [**First Name (Titles) 38944**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1988**] for [**11-1**]).
He last had his nephrostomy tube changed [**9-29**] and has not experienced any obstruction or decreased urine output, however has noticed L sided groin/LLQ pain since placement that he attributes to the stent.
The pain is relieved with squatting.
Denies weight change, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity oedema, cough, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: [**2144**] --> Dx of high grade state T1 transitional cell ca with negative nodes [**2145-2-18**] --> underwent transurethral resection of the bladder tumor  Pathology: revealed transitional cell carcinoma with focal glandular differentiation, grade [**2-22**], invasive into the muscularis propria with foci of static invasion.
Post-op course c/b an anastomotic leak and abscess formation requiring a temporary ileostomy taken down [**2145-7-28**].
[**3-/2150**] --> CT scan was reportedly normal, persistently abnormal urine cytology despite normal cystoscopies.
[**2151-3-30**] --> annual CT scan showed a 1.8 cm heterogeneous solid appearing left renal lesion and a 15 x 10 mm soft tissue lesion adjacent to the left psoas muscle in the upper pelvis, adjacent to the surgical clips and encasing the left common iliac artery, suspicious for recurrent disease.
[**2151-4-9**] --> underwent a renal ultrasound on which showed a 1.4-cm lesion arising from the mid pole of the left kidney with low-level echoes, new evidence of left sided hydronephrosis, and a 2.8-cm lesion arising from the anterior aspect of the liver.
He then underwent an MRI of the abdomen which noted severe left sided hydronephrosis and a small, rounded, hemorrhagic cyst in the lower pole of the left kidney measuring 1.6 cm.
[**7-/2151**] --> underwent PET scan in and the preliminary report showed an FDG avid soft tissue lesion around the left distal ureter in the mesocolon and left groin, likely representing recurrent disease; multiple FDG avid retroperitoneal lymph nodes; a 10 mm FDG avid sclerotic lesion in the left symphysis pubis; bulky left thyroid lobe; and an 18 x 15mm exophytic hyperdense lesion in the midpole of the left kidney, likely representing hemorrhagic cyst [**2151-9-29**] --> decreased output from L nephrostomy - tube replaced with good drainage .

SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
Urine cytology [**2151-10-8**]: No malignany cells .
Reviewing prior exams, there is a suggestion that the cephalad extension of the neobladder is typically directed to the left side where both ureters join.
Given the recent manipulation and the lack of an obstructing calculus or other lesion found, it is postulated that there may be a "twist" or other change in orientation, which results in the obstruction of this distal ureter.
As this kidney requires percutaneous nephrostomy, a diagnostic urogram at that time would be most useful for further diagnosis just prior to therapy.
Renal scan:High-grade obstruction of the right kidney.
Local recurrence is not excluded, although focal enhancing mass at this region is not definitely seen.
Abnormal enhancing soft tissue in the left inguinal region is of uncertain etiology but could be inflammatory in nature.
Adjacent to this left inguinal abnormality, there are borderline enlarged left inguinal and left distal external iliac lymph nodes.
Multiple bone metastases in bilateral iliac bones, right pubic bone, and bilateral sacral ala. 5.
Bibasilar atelectasis, more on the right with a small right pleural effusion.
Rare highly atypical urothelial cells in a background of  	 reactive changes and inflammatory cells.
Atypical urothelial cells, present singly and in clusters,  	 instrumentation effect versus urothelial neoplasia.
Histiocytes, many neutrophils, fungal forms consistent with  	 [**Female First Name (un) **] species, and red blood cells.
Antegrade nephrostogram demonstrated occlusion at middle portion of the left ureter, mild hydronephrosis, and no filling defects visualized.
Sent for culture and cytology as requested.
The catheter was attached to a bag for external drainage.
Multiple foci of increased tracer uptake within the pelvis with corresponding sclerotic lesions on CT worrisome for metastatic disease.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 year-old man with a history of bladder ca s/p cystectomy with neobladder '[**44**], and recent left nephrostomy tube and stent secondary to ureteral obstruction who presents with fever, chills, and hypotension and positive U/A.
# Sepsis: Pt presented with leukocytosis to 12K, fever, and hypotension to SBP 80s intermittently.
A urinary source was suspected given the pt's anatomy, known hydronephrosis and U/A from nephrostomy tube c/w UTI.
[**10-23**] urine cultures grew back E. Coli with >100K colonies and Vanc was subsequently d/c'd.
# ARF - Creatinine to 1.3 up from baseline of 0.9.
Etiologies included obstruction vs. sepsis vs. prerenal.
The pt underwent an MR urogram on [**10-25**] that revealed Right hydronephrosis and hydroureter with area of narrowing  at the anastomosis between the distal right ureter and the chimney of the neobladder.
The pt underwent a renal scan that showed High-grade obstruction of the right kidney.
# Bladder Ca: The mass seen causing the hydronephroiss as well as the bone lesions are concerning for recurrent disease vs a new primary.
# DMII - Treated with glipizide and RISS after transfer from the MICU.
# HTN - Given sepsis, renal impairment lisinopril was discontinued.
# Code: Full code, confirmed with patient  # Comm: wife [**Name (NI) 17**] - (h) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 38945**], (c) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 38946**]   Medications on Admission: - Glipizide 5mg po daily - Lisinopril 10mg po daily - ASA 81mg po daily (not taking since nephrostomy tube placed) - B12 250mg po daily - MVI .

These will need to be replaced in the future by either your Urologist or Interventional Radiology.
You were also found to have new masses in your pelvis and will need to discuss further evaluation and treatment with you primary Oncologists.
