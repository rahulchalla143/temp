Admission Date:  [**2116-1-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2116-1-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-9-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis Chemotherapy  History of Present Illness: 40 yo HIV+ male (diagnosed [**2114**], last CD4 366, VL 54,000, never on antiretroviral therapy), ?HBV, who presented to the ED [**1-1**] with a several day h/o abdominal pain worst in the RLQ, nausea, vomiting, and SOB/DOE.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] states that these symptoms appeared to begin abruptly, and denies any associated fever, chills, or night sweats prior to admission.
He was noted on exam to have elevated neck veins, tachycardia, and significant pulsus paradoxus.
Follow-up echocardiogram demonstrated EF >55%, with 1.5-2.2cm circumferential pericardial effusion with extesive stranding and likely loculation, and RV diastolic collapse.
Unaware of having an acute retroviral conversion syndrome.
No opportunistic infections.
Social History: in monogamous homosexual relationship.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2116-1-4**]):    NO GROWTH.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Pending):    ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2116-1-2**]):     NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Final [**2116-1-16**]):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
[**2116-1-1**] 03:03PM OTHER BODY FLUID WBC-[**Numeric Identifier 961**]* RBC-[**Numeric Identifier 56618**]* Polys-1* Lymphs-1* Monos-0 Macro-2* Other-96* [**2116-1-1**] 03:03PM OTHER BODY FLUID TotProt-5.3 Glucose-60 LD(LDH)-[**2089**] Amylase-18 Albumin-2.8 Cytology: Numerous atypical and degenerated lymphoid cells are present   singly.
Pericardial fluid cytospins (A):           Primary Effusion Lymphoma (see note)           Immunoperoxidase studies performed are not contributory due to a high background staining.
Note: Primary effusion lymphoma is a form of high grade B cell lymphoma confined to serosal cavities.
It typically occur in the setting of HIV infection, but can also be seen in other immunodeficiency states, and presents with pleural or pericardial effusions containing large anaplastic plasmacytic immunoblasts which are typically negative for CD20 and CD79a but positive for CD138.
Typically there is no associated mass effect.
Cell block, pericardial fluid (B):           Atypical degenerate plasmacytoid cells consistent with necrotic primary effusion lymphoma (see note).
There is a low suspicion for appeniditis given other features including air in the lumen and lack of associated findings.
Large paracardial effusion associated pleural effusion, hepatic and venous congestion.
Periportal adenopathy.
Small amount of free fluid in pelvis.
CT chest ([**1-2**]): Interval decrease in size of pericardial effusion following pericardial drain placement, with a small-to-moderate amount of fluid persisting.
Thickening of the pericardium with evidence of enhancement, in keeping with exudative effusion.
Interval increase in size of right pleural effusion.
Bibasilar compressive atelectatic changes.
No echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CXR [**1-4**]: Bilateral effusions; the left slightly smaller than yesterday.
Brief Hospital Course: 1)Pericardial effusion: Because of his tachycardia, elevated JVD, and RV collapse seen on echo, his effusion was drained emergently in the cath lab, and he was monitored in the CCU until the drain was pulled.
The fluid cytology was consistent with Primary Effusion Lymphoma.
This lymphoma is associated with HHV-8, but the sample that was sent to the micro lab to test for this was lost.
He had no evidence of reaccumulation of the pericardial fluid.
He denied shortness of breath, and his oxygen saturation was normal on room air.
