Exophytic polypoid, hyperenhancing mucosal mass lesion in the posterior hypopharynx protruding into the airway lumen at the level of the piriform sinuses without obstruction.
This, in combination with enlarged left level II and level V lymph nodes, one of which is necrotic, is concerning for malignancy.
Nonenhancing, cystic-appearing lesion is noted on the right retropharyngeal and right masticator space, causing mild mass effect in the right carotid space, correlation with MRI of the neck with and without contrast is recommended for further characterication.
Hyperdense secretions in the left maxillary sinus may represent fungal or inspissated secretions, incompletely evaluated on this study.
Patulous upper esophagus.
FDG-avid hypopharyngeal mass and cervical lymphadenopathy.
FDG-avid right 7th rib sclerotic focus, concerning for metastasis.

[**2108-8-8**] RIGHT RIB X-RAY: IMPRESSION: 1.
Large amount of free air underneath the hemidiaphragms.
This should be correlated with the recent surgery and if it cannot be explained by the surgery, further evaluation with CT can be performed to assess for perforation.
Sclerotic right seventh lateral rib lesion concerning for metastasis is best evaluated on the PET-CT examination.
Unchanged bilateral retropharyngeal and masticator space lesions, with cystic/necrotic changes on the right side, previously demonstrated by neck CT on [**2108-7-19**], likely related with a history of hypopharyngeal cancer.

Suboptimal image quality.
Preserved global left ventricular systolic function.
Cannot assess right ventricular function, aortic valve structure/function, or tricuspid valve structure/function.
[**2108-9-2**] CXR: IMPRESSION: There are bilateral layering pleural effusions and residual patchy airspace opacity in the left upper lobe, left middle lung and at both bases.
There is likely a superimposed component of mild interstitial edema as well.
No pneumothorax is seen.
[**2108-9-3**] ECHO: No thrombus/mass.
Non-occlusive deep venous thrombosis within a short segment of the right peroneal vein.
No deep venous thrombosis within the left lower extremity.
[**2108-9-10**] CXR: IMPRESSION:  No change from 9:54 a.m. in pneumomediastinum and bibasilar opacities.

The extent and severity of the parenchymal opacity is similar to the previous examination.
No pneumothorax.
The on previous examination identified paratracheal air and subcutaneous air in the left lower neck region, indicative of pneumomediastinum at that time, cannot be seen anymore.
No pneumothoraces present.
The previously existing pulmonary congestive pattern and bilateral basal parenchymal infiltrates have regressed markedly.
No new abnormalities are seen.
A remaining diffuse haze on the left base is indicative for some pleural effusion layering posteriorly.

No newly appeared parenchymal opacities.
No pulmonary edema.
No mediastinal widening or pneumothorax.

His hospital course was significant for initiation of tube feeds after failing a swallow evaluation.
Chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin, 5FU was initiated [**2108-8-11**], complicated by diarrhea, severe cytopenias, ?
On [**2108-8-19**], he received 10mg olanzapine for nausea and subsequently became very lethargic and developed fever, hypotension, acute kidney injury, and ultimately transfered to the ICU [**2108-8-20**] for sepsis and neutropenic fever.
His ICU course was significant for diagnosis of LLL pneumonia, hypotension attributed to hypovolemia [**3-8**] limited PO intake/diarrhea vs. sepsis, improvement in acute renal failure, hypernatremia.
ENT planned for tracheostomy [**2108-8-28**] for airway protection during therapy, but on [**2108-8-28**] early AM, he was found to have left facial droop.
TTE showed no evidence of clot.
A rechallenge with anticoagulation failed a second time due to bleeding from his tumor and trach site.
On [**2108-9-24**] he coughed out his tracheostomy cannula.
Replacement was complicated by bleeding and hemoptysis requiring ENT evaluation.
Bleeding/hemoptysis resolved gradually over next 4 days.
He again developed aspiration pneumonia [**2108-9-28**] and was started on cefepime and vancomycin.
On admission, he was breathing comfortably and in no distress.
Repeat CXR showed no change in pneumomediastinum.
Enoxaparin was held overnight on day 1 of MICU course because of bleeding from suction.
Continued suction and humidified air via trach.
# Recurrent aspiration pneumonia/sepsis: Resolved.
LLL pneumonia on CXR treated initially with vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole due to concern for aspiration.
Continued to have secretions and rhonchi.
Aspiration precautions.
# Eye pain: Due to post-herpetic neuralgia +/- stye.
Pain initially controlled with gabapentin, titrated off [**2108-9-15**] to avoid somnolence.
CTA [**2108-9-20**] showed soft-tissue swelling around the trach, but no active bleed.
# Hemoptysis: As above.
No bleeding from tumor, likely source is mild trauma from trach replacement.

Hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (throat cancer).
Hypertension (high blood pressure).
Hypokalemia (low potassium level).
Neutropenia (low white blood count).
Anemia (low red blood cell count).
Acute kidney failure.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for a biopsy of a tumor in your throat (hypopharynx).
The tumor biopsy confirmed squamous cell carcinoma (cancer) and you were transferred to the Oncology floor to start chemotherapy.
MRI of the brain did not show any cancer in the brain.
Video swallow evaluation showed severe aspiration of food and liquids.
Tube feeds were started and you developed high blood sugars managed with insulin.
You needed several different types of anti-nausea medications.
You developed fevers and pneumonia that were treated in the Intensive Care Unit with IV antibiotics.
You also developed a stroke with left-sided weakness.
The stroke likely originated from a blood clot in the right leg that traveled in the blood stream and passed through a hole in the heart (patent foramen ovale) and then into the brain and kidney also causing some kidney damage.
To prevent difficulty breathing from future radiation therapy, a tracheostomy was placed.
However, this was complicated by bleeding and the blood thinner was not able to be restarted.
You also developed a rash on your left forehead.
You were treated with an anti-viral drug acyclovir and a pain medicine gabapentin for it.
You developed recurrent pneumonia and were started on IV antibiotics.
You coughed out your trach tube, but this was replaced.
