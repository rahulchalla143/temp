The patient has very limited mobility at baseline and uses a wheelchair.
He requires the use of his arms to help get out of bed and into his wheelchair and also for balance.
He has had significant pain his his right arm since his fall and this has made getting around his house increasingly difficult.
He had a CXR which showed mild [**Date Range 1106**] prominence but no focal infiltrates.

Mild paranasal sinus disease.
Low attenuation collection about the right sternoclavicular joint, which is superiorly and anteriorly subluxed with surrounding soft tissue and muscular edema.
Amorphous calcifications in both sternoclavicular joints.
While infection must be excluded, these findings may be secondary to trauma in the setting of pre-existing CPPD arthropathy.
Circumferential thickening of the right pleura in the setting of prior asbestos exposure.
If there is no recent outside chest CT, this should be further evaluated with a dedicated chest CT. .
[**11-8**] ECHO Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis (EF 40-45%).

The aortic valve leaflets (3) are moderately thickened with focal calcification of the right coronary cusp.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the pulmonic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No definitive evidence of valvular vegetation.
Focal thickening of the right aortic cusp that appears unchanged from prior study [**2174-3-14**].
There is no evidence of pneumothorax or other complication.
Findings are quite concerning for a septic right L4-5 facet joint with right paraspinal abscess and possible developing discitis.
It is possible that there is a small epidural fluid collection at L4-5, as detailed above, though this is not conclusive.
Severe multilevel spinal canal narrowing and cauda equina compression.
Moderately severe multilevel bilateral foraminal narrowing.
Moderate to severe lumbar spine and SI joint degenerative changes.

Diffuse calcified atherosclerotic disease with left femoral [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] stents; otherwise no radiopaque foreign bodies.
[**11-11**] KUB Small bowel loops and large bowel loops are distended.
Moderate-to-severe degenerative changes are in the lumbar spine.
Low lung volumes limit assessment.
Left basilar and retrocardiac opacification is consistent with atelectasis although a pneumonitis from aspiration or infection can certainly be superimposed.
Peribrochial cuffing, cephalization, and a small left pleural effusion suggest continue volume overload/congestion.
No pneumothorax.
Bilateral calcified pleural plaques.
[**11-18**] VIDEO SWALLOW Normal video oropharyngeal swallow exam without evidence of penetration or aspiration.
MRI SPINE There is continued suspicion for question of septic arthritis of  the right facet joint at L4-5 level with a small epidural and paraspinal fluid collection.
[**11-21**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and anterolateral walls.
The remaining segments are mildly hypokinetic.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle (but apical images are suboptimal image quality).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-3-14**], the regional left ventricular systolic dysfuntion is more extensive c/w interim ischemia.
Suspicious finding on the recent non-enhanced examinations is demonstrated to represent a 2.5 cm (CC) relatively thick rim-enhancing fluid collection, centered at the L5 level, dorsal to and significantly compressing the thecal sac.
There may be a right ventral epidural component, as well.
At least two small rim-enhancing fluid collections the right paraspinal muscles, likely representing small focal abscesses, which may relate to septic arthritis of the right L4-L5 facet joint; however, this process is not definitely demonstrated on the present examination.
Pathologic T2-hyperintensity within the L3-4 through L5-S1 discs, without definitive discal enhancement or endplate destruction; this may be degenerative in nature.
Extensive multilevel, multifactorial degenerative changes with severe spinal canal stenosis at the L2-3 through L4-5 levels.
New central venous access line over the left subclavian vein.
Unchanged sternal wires, unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with mild overhydration.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has been placement of a nasogastric tube, that extends well into the stomach.
Poor definition of the hemidiaphragms raises the possibility of developing pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis bilaterally.
Poor definition of the hemidiaphragms is consistent with bibasilar atelectasis and effusion.
Substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists with some evidence of [**Date Range 1106**] congestion.
No evidence of acute hemorrhage or acute [**Date Range 1106**] territorial infarction.
The lung volumes have minimally decreased.
There is unchanged moderate cardiomegaly, the radiographic signs suggesting overhydration have slightly increased.
Also, a potentially pre-existing right pleural effusion is better visible than on the previous image.
The patient is in mild pulmonary edema, that is also unchanged since the prior study, accompanied by bilateral pleural effusions, moderate.
There are no new focal consolidations, but bilateral basal retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
KUB There is a significantly dilated air filled stomach.
There are multiple air filled and dilated small bowel loops (luminal diameter up to 3.5 cm) and large bowel loops (luminal diameter up to 6.5 cm).
There is no evidence of air fluid levels or free air.
[**11-28**] CXR In comparison with the study of [**11-27**], there has been a substantial increase in bilateral pulmonary opacifications in this patient with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and evidence of midline sternal wires.
The radiographic findings could reflect severe pulmonary edema, widespread pneumonia, or even ARDS.
There is no bowel obstruction.
No pneumothorax.
[**11-30**] CT SPINE Severe multilevel disc degenerative changes throughout the lumbar spine as described in detail above.
The previously identified epidural collection at L5 level is not visualized in this examination, correlation with MRI is recommended, since CT is not able to provide the same anatomical detail in the thecal sac.
PATHOLOGY [**11-17**] GASTRIC BIOPSY: Antral and fundic mucosa, no diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
No bacillary forms consistent with H. pylori identified on [**Doctor Last Name 6311**] stain.
EEG [**11-22**] This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine sampling showed a mild to moderately slow and disorganized background consisting of mixed theta frequencies.
This is suggestive of a moderate to severe encephalopathy which may be secondary to medications.
No focal or lateralized abnormalities were noted and no epileptiform features were seen.
[**11-23**] This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine sampling showed a mild to moderately slow and disorganized background with occasional periods of burst suppression.
This is consistent with a moderate to severe encephalopathy and may have been related to medications.
No focal abnormalities were noted and no epileptiform features were seen.
His hospital course was initially complicated by an UGI bleed leading to ICU admission, then later complicated by vfib arrest in MRI scanner while undergoing imaging for back pain concerning for epidural abcess, leading to CCU admission.
He was found to have an epidural abcess, however given his high surgical risk, we proceeded with medical management.
He continued to improve on the floor with no further complications.
#) Bacteremia: Pt presented with fever and elevated WBC and was found to have MSSA in his blood.
The source of his bacteremia was unclear, however the most likely source was his lower extremity ulcers vs possible indolent [**Known lastname **] infection from prior [**Known lastname 1106**] surgery.
He was seen by podiatry and [**Known lastname 1106**] who were not concerned for osteomyelitis or active infection of the foot.
There were no valvular vegetations on TEE, therefore little concern for endocarditis.
He did have evidence of infection of his sternoclavicular joint and an aspiration was positive for MSSA, and this was thought to be resulting from his bacteremia rather than a primary infection in the context of a fall.
# s/p cardiac arrest: During MRI scan for assessment of back pain patient went into cardiac arrest.
However, the patient remained hypotensive and was started on pressors, sedation, and Arctic Sun cooling protocol in the CCU.
TTE was initially concerning for new wall motion abnormalities suggesting an ischemic etiology, but EKG showed no evidence of ACS and CE remained flat.
After completion of the cooling protocol, the patient was successfully weaned off the ventilator and extubated without difficulty.
He regained consciousness and appered to be back to his neurologic baseline.
He stayed in NSR with only a few episodes of afib with aberrancy while on tele on the floor.
#) Epidural Abcess: Pt reported back pain with point tenderness and neurosurgery was consulted out of concern for epidural abcess.
MRI was performed and was concerning for epidural abscess as well as R paraspinal muscle abcesses by MRI, however the study was inadequate.
IR guided drainage of the fluid collection was attempted but minimal fluid was obtained and no organisms were isolated in the aspirate.
He was treated with IV abx and monitored for neurological change.
Given his baseline disabiliy and ongoing issues with incontinence, we monitored for decrease in lower extremity strength (anti-gravity at baseline) and saddle parasthesia, and pt remained clinically stable.
His pain also improved and on discharge was controlled with tylenol.
Neurosurgery plans for f/u with MRI lumbar spine after completion of abx course, for which pt will be hospitalized given his inability to tolerate MRI without sedation and high risk for complications with anesthesia.
Would also recommend monitoring neurologic status while at rehab, contacting neurosurgery urgently if change in neuro exam.
# chronic atrial fibrillation: His coumadin was initially held on admission due to supratherapeutic INR and then [**2-14**] GI bleed.
It was felt that although anticoagulation is often still used up to four weeks s/p conversion to NSR from AF, in the setting of his recent GI bleed, anticoagulation should be held.
#) Coffee-ground emesis: The patient had increasing emesis throughout his admission, first occurring subsequent to meals.
On [**11-12**] he had 4-5 episodes of vomiting and then developed coffee ground emesis requiring MICU transfer.
EGD showed a single, clean base, 2.5cm x3cm non-bleeding ulcer with blood clot in the antrum.
His hematocrit subsequently stabilized and he had no further coffee ground emesis at the time of his transfer back to the floor, however his Hct was seen to slowly drift downwards and he received another unit of blood before discharge to the floor.
He was treated for h pylori infection with flagyl, clarithromycin and IV PPI given equivicol H pylori ab screening test.
Plan was for colonoscopy as well but this was deferred [**2-14**] cardiac arrest.
He had no further episodes of hematemasis while on the floor and crit remained stable.
His Metoprolol and lisinopril were titrated to BP control prior to discharge, pressures in 120s-130s on discharge however may need further titration as an outpatient for optimal control.
He was also re-started on lasix prior to discharge given his hx of volume overload as an inpatient, however at a decreased dose given that he had poor PO intake and increased bicarb while in the hospital.
#) Acute Renal Failure: Elevated creatinine on admission.
Pre-renal and thought to be due to dehydration in the context of poor mobility/poor access to fluids.
Lasix and lisinopril were initially held, but restarted due to hypertension and volume overload.
#) Ileus: pt with abd distension and decreased BMs on return from the cardiac intensive care unit.
KUB showed no acute obstruction.
#) s/p falls: The patient had two mechanical falls in the setting of living alone and having little sensation and poor mobility in his lower extremities.
There was evidence of chronic degenerative changes but no acute process.
Has had minimal insulin requirements as an inpatient, however QID blood glucose was initially continued due to poor nutrition and hypoglycemia.
Foot xray not concerning for aggresive osteo at this time.
#) Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: Pt had some evidence of volume overload on CXR and by exam throughout the admission.
PO lasix dose decreased on discharge given pts poor PO intake and increased bicarb, however may need to be up-titrated as an outpatient.
#) Nutrition: Pt with poor PO intake therefore NG tube was placed when the patient returned from the cardiac intensive care unit.
Placement required IR guidance given his hx of prior nose surgeries.
Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening (in the setting of prior asbestos exposure) noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis on CXR [**2174-11-17**].
Worsened with GI bleed but improved after transfusions and stabilized.
Iron supplementation was held on discharge given his history of consitipation.
Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Sublingual once as needed for chest pain.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Suppository Rectal HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Tablet [**Month/Day/Year **]: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Bacteremia - Sternal/spinal MSSA osteomyelitis - Antral ulcer with bleeding - Acute blood loss anemia - Acute renal failure - Cardiac arrest  Secondary: - Right pleural thickening NOS - CAD s/p CABG (LIMA-LAD, SVG-PDA, and SVG-OM) - Chronic systolic heart failure (40%) - Atrial fibrillation - Small secundum ASD/PFO - Left retinal artery occlusion - Peripheral [**Hospital1 1106**] disease - s/p bilateral hallux amputations - Chronic right foot ulceration - Hypertension - Anemia of chronic disease - Diabetes mellitus type II   Discharge Condition: stable but frail   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for falls and you were found to have bacteria in your blood, therefore you were treated with intravenous antibiotics.
While in the hospital, you developed an upper gastrointestinal bleed and were seen by gastroenterology who examined your stomach with a camera and found ulcers.
These were cauterized and injected to prevent any further bleeding.
Additionally, while in the hospital, you had back pain and were found to have an abcess in your spine.
While getting imaging of this abcess, your heart went into an abnormal rhythm and you were transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit.
You remained stable however had decreased oral intake and urinary retention, therefore you were seen by nutrition and had a foley catheter placed.
Please return to the hospital if you have fevers, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, increasing weakness in your legs, or any other symptoms that are concerning to you.
