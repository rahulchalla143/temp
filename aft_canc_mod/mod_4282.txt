Briefly, Mr. [**Known lastname 65646**] is a 69 yo man with hx of schizophrenia, COPD, Prostate CA on suppresive therapy since [**2154**], cryptogenic cirrhosis, large ingunoscrotal hernia, and long-standing scrotal edema who presented from his group home with increased LE and scrotal and was admitted to MICU for hyponatremia on [**7-11**].
Hyponatremia improved with lasix diuresis and he was sent to the floor the next day [**7-12**].
He was doing well for the next 2 days but then was found to minimally responsive, obtunded, febrile and hypoxic to the 70s (came back to low 90s on NRB) when he was receiving an infusion of albumin, so he was transfered back to the MICU on [**7-14**] for hypoxia and altered mental status.
ABG at that point showed respiratory acidosis with hypercarbia and the decision was made to intubate him for hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Sputum culture grew streptococcus pneumoniae on [**7-14**].
Pt was bronched on [**7-15**] which revealed thick plugs throughout right airways with purulent drainage distally; BAL and washings were sent but no microorg seen on gram stain or in culture.
Currently, pt complains of some shortness of breath on 5 liters of oxygen.
No chest pain or palpitations.
No pain anywhere.
He is complaining of increased lower extremity edema, and said his scrotal edema has been stable for many years.
