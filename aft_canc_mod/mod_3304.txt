History of Present Illness: 61 year old man with metastatic esophageal cancer to liver and lung presents with 2-3 days of vague facial swelling.
Yesterday morning, patient began to complian of mild positional dyspnea with standing.
Yesterday afternoon, patient developed acute facial swelling and plethora and bilateral UE edema.
He had stopped his lovenox 5 days prior after completed a shorted course as determined given the emphasis on quality of life and goals of care.
Lovenox was for a sponatenous R upper extremity DVT on [**6-8**].
However, he developed severe dehydration, mouth sores, and overall failure to thrive on this and was admitted to the hospital on [**5-28**], eight days after his treatment.
He ended up having a prolonged admission for several weeks during which time he developed febrile neutropenia, numerous infections, and pneumococcal bacteremia as well as acute renal failure and thrombocytopenia.
Patient has TPN/lab dual port, esophageal stent placed, was admitted with facial swelling and found to have SVC syndrome likely due to a clot in the SVC around his port.
In the ED, VSS, CT chest with no evidence of PE but evidence of acute on chronic SVC syndrome.
ROS: otherwise negative  Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: ====================== He initially presented in [**11/2142**] due to dysphagia and weight loss.
At that time, he had a barium swallow, which showed a pinpoint narrowing of his distal esophagus.
He did not have much improvement with the dilatation and in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year underwent a second dilatation once again with no improvement.
He had motility tests, which were most consistent with achalasia.
He had a CT scan after this which showed a 1.5 cm gastrohepatic lymph node.
Of note, they saw some ulceration in the GE junction and a thick abnormal fold concerning for esophageal or gastric cardia cancer.
The biopsy showed moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
He was admitted from [**2143-11-26**] to the [**2143-12-3**] with febrile neutropenia and dehydration.
Pathology from this showed a metastatic adenocarcinoma with 4/6 perigastric lymph nodes positive, and a separate foci of tumor in the adjacent adipose tissue.
He had liver lesions noted on a CT scan [**2145-1-16**].
He had these biopsied on [**2145-1-27**] and the pathology came back as consistent with metastasis from esophageal cancer.
- h/o atrial fibrillation - h/o S. viridans bacteremia - Sinusitis, status post surgery - Hypertension - Vocal cord paralysis  Social History: He originally moved from [**Country 6171**] 17 years ago.
Family History: He has a father with pancreatic cancer who died at the age of 70.
Together with diffuse stranding of the upper chest wall and opacification of multiple collateral vessels, findings are consistent with SVC syndrome.
Mild consolidation in the left lower lung was previously present and may represent aspiration with atelectasis.
Left pleural effusion is improved.
Likely evolving splenic infarct.
Left diaphragmatic hernia containing a loop of transverse colon.
Venogram:   Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 61 year old Male with metstatic esophageal cancer presenting with SVC syndrome secondary port clot on hep gtt.
# SVC syndrome - Secondary to visible port clot on dual lumen port placed in 7/[**2143**].
Patient had completed course of lovenox for R UE dvt spontanous 5 days prior.
No indication for steroids or diruetics.
Endovascular stent placement not needed and no evidence of airway obstruction.
Pt had a TPA infusion for 1 day without complete resolution of the clot; pt was monitored in the ICU during this time and there were no complications.
# Esophageal cancer - known liver and lung mets.
# Nutrition - patient was started on TPN one month in setting of progression of esophageal ca and colitis.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Disp:*40 Tablet, Rapid Dissolve(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: VNA of [**Location (un) 270**]-East & Visiting Nurse Hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: SVC symdrome secondary to clot around mediport  s/p lysis of clot  s/p venogram and ballon angioplasty and rotorooter metastatic esophageal cancer s/p Upper DVT   Discharge Condition: stable, afebrile, tolerating diet   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for facial swelling which was found to be caused by a clot around your port site causing "superior vena cava" syndrome.
You required clot lysis with a heparin drip.
You are to continue lovenox for lifelong anticoagulation.
You underwent a venogram and a vessel angioplasty balloon dialation procedure.
Contact your physician if you develop repeated swelling of your face or upper extremity edema as this may reflect another clot around your port.
Development of unilateral leg swelling or sudden shortness of breath and chest pain may also reflect a blood clot.
