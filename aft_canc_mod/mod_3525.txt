HPI: 67 yo with metastatic melanoma (last chemo 2.5 wks ago) with one day of emesis and headaches on [**9-12**], developed an expressive aphasia and increased lethargy on [**9-13**].
CT scan reveals a >20cc LEFT occipital bleed per neuroICY team.
It is unclear if this represents an acute spontaneous bleed in the setting of thrombocytopenia and repeated Valsalva maneuvering or an underlying metastasis.
Spent 2 days in ICU with slow resolution of her mental status.

More recently inguinal mass found -ITP s/p splenectomy -s/p partial colectomy (for uncontroled LGIB during ITP) .
In terms of history of malignancy, she notes that her maternal aunt had ovarian cancer.

Please mark and measure all lesi Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 67 year old woman with metastatic melanoma.
INDICATION: 67-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Again seen are innumerable bilateral metastatic lesions scattered throughout the lungs.
No pleural effusions or consolidations are identified within the lungs.
No pathologic axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy is identified.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Again seen are innumerable metastatic hypodense lesions throughout the liver.
These lesions appear to have increased in both size and number.
The bile duct dilatation extends to the head of the pancreas, and metastasis to the distal bile duct cannot be excluded.
Again seen is a lesion in the left side overlying the peritoneum that has increased in size from approximately 0.5 cm on prior study to 1.2 cm on today's study, and is concerning for metastatic disease.
Again seen is a very large soft tissue mass arising at the level of the kidneys and extending all the way down into the pelvis.
On prior study the greatest cross-sectional diameter of this mass was 10 x 6.9 cm.
Again seen are multiple bilateral hypodense renal lesions that possibly represent simple renal cysts although metastatic disease cannot be ruled out.
Large and small bowel appear unremarkable.
The large soft tissue mass which extends into the pelvis as described above is seen with cross-sectional dimensions measured on series 4, image 71.
BONE WINDOWS: Several lucent areas are seen within the vertebrae, possibly consistent with degenerative disease of the spine, however, lytic metastases cannot be excluded.
IMPRESSION: Interval progression of widely metastatic disease.
Increase in intrathoracic, abdominal, and pelvic disease.

Please note that in regard to the category of stroke, the etiologies could include amyloid angiopathy (primary hemorrhage), hemorrhagic transformation of either an arterial or venous infarct.
Altered mental status.
A nearly 3 cm area of hemorrhage is noted within the left occipital lobe, with intraventricular extension as well.
There are no other areas of abnormal density within the brain.
The left cerebral sulci are effaced, likely reflecting mass effect from the hemorrhage, as well as edema surrounding this abnormality.
There is no shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
CONCLUSION: Large left occipital lobe hemorrhage with surrounding edema and intraventricular extension of blood.
Given the history of melanoma, hemorrhage into a new metastasis could be considered as opposed to a hemorrhagic infarct.
A second punctate area of hyperdensity likely indicates a hemorrhagic metastasis within the left cerebellum.

FINDINGS:  There is no appreciable change in the left occipital lobe hemorrhage or surrounding edema.
No new areas of hemorrhage are identified.
There is no ventricular dilatation.
There is no shift of normally midline structures or narrowing of the basal cisternal spaces.
IMPRESSION: Stable intracranial hemorrhages, likely associated with the patient's underlying diagnosis of melanoma.

INDICATION: History of melanoma with intracranial hemorrhage.
Assess for metastatic disease.
Located within the right cerebellar hemisphere just posterior and lateral to one metastasis is a focal rounded area of low signal intensity, which is of unknown etiology.
The area of hemorrhage in the left occipital lobe is unchanged allowing for differences in modality.
A small rounded nodular area of presumed enhancement is seen in the lateral anterior aspect of the lesion.
Direct comparison with the non-contrast sagittal T1 image is limited, but this finding appears to represent enhancement, and a hemorrhagic metastasis as an etiology for the patient's hemorrhage in this area is of concern, given the history of melanoma and metastases seen in the cerebellum.
Additionally, a questionable enhancing focus in the midline at the anterior corpus callosum, and a smaller rounded focus of enhancement just lateral to the right temporal ventricular tip are present, which are also suspicious for metastatic disease.
There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.
Diffusion- weighted imaging shows no areas of acute ischemia.
Multiple abnormally enhancing foci within the cerebellum, and likely within both cerebral hemispheres, most likely representing metastases.
Questionable area of enhancement seen in the left occipital lobe lateral to area of hemorrhage.
This cannot be directly confirmed as there are no pre- contrast axial T1-weighted sequences, but the proximity of this probable area of enhancement raises suspicion for a hemorrhagic metastasis as the etiology for the patient's occipital hematoma.
Left occipital parenchymal hemorrhage unchanged allowing for differences in modality, since the head CT from [**9-15**].

Pt now doing well and thinking clearly.
Consider cerebral edema if worsens.
#Thrombocytosis - Likely reactive in response to gCSF in setting of splenectomy.
Holding asa and plavix for now given Hx of head bleed.
CXR showed no new air space opacities but slight increase in size in known metastatic nodules.
#Neutropenia - Chemo related.
No antibiotics given.
#Pain control - oxycontin 80 mg po bid with dilaudid prn for breakthrough with good control.
Pt has large mass in L pelvis which makes feeling of constipation worse.
