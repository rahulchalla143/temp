There is no evident pneumothorax.
Right lung peripheral opacities better evaluated in prior CT [**8-5**] and are unchanged.
[**2154-8-31**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP) There has been markedly improved in right upper, right perihilar and right lower lobe opacities consistent with improving hemorrhage or aspiration.
There is no evident pneumothorax.
There are no increasing right pleural effusions.
The diffuse area of opacification involving the perihilar region extending into both the apical and lower zone on the right is again seen.
Again, this could well represent post-procedure hemorrhage, though supervening pneumonia cannot be excluded.
[**2154-8-30**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP) IMPRESSIONS: Extensive right central and upper lung airspace opacity, which may reflect hemorrhage from the recent procedure, or asymmetric pulmonary edema.
[**2154-8-30**] Pathology Tissue: Tracheal tumor Distal ,   [**2154-8-30**] [**Last Name (LF) 829**],[**First Name3 (LF) 828**] C. Not Finalized   Brief Hospital Course: # Apnea/Hypoxia: The patient experienced apnea in the immediate post-operative period following debridement of a tracheal nodule.
The prolonged hypoxia post-operatively was attributed to aspiration pneumonitis likely with an element of post-operative inflammation from the procedure itself.
The patient remained rhoncorous with course upper airway breath sounds throughout the hospitalization.
CXR ruled out PNA as a potentialy source of hypoxia, and the patient did not produce significant volumes of concentration of blood in the sputum concerning for tracheal bleed.
Other possibilities include worsening of underlying lung cancer which is unlikely to explain acute hypoxia.
The patient was taken off supplemental oxygen the following day and sat'ed within her normal baseline range 88-92% on room air without any problems at rest.
# Hct Drop: The patient presented with a Hct 44.7 and found to have a Hct of 33.1 post-operatively.
The low Hct is most likely attributable to fluids received during procedure and minimal blood loss, however given the 12 point drop, her lab values were followed and the Hct level was stable and began to rise without event or concern for chonic blood loss.
# Non-Small Cell Lung CA: A new tracheal mass identified on CT in [**Month (only) **] was highly concerning for metastasis and likely to grow to occlude airway the airway, so surgical debridement was warranted with interventional pulmonology without intraoperative complications outside of apnea/hypoxia as elaborated on above.
[**Name (NI) **] quite clearly does not desire intubation or heroic measures.
4. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for insomnia.
10. ipratropium-albuterol 18-103 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: [**11-24**] puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 932**] Area VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Aspiration-induced hypoxia  Secondary: Poorly differentiated SCC of lung: - right upper lobectomy and chemotherapy [**2148**] - left lower lobe nodule 1.4cm, non-diagnostic CT-guided biopsy, s/p CyberKnife Coronary artery disease: Coronary angioplasty [**2139**], [**2151**], CABG x 3v [**2151**] Infectious colitis [**2152**] Hypertension Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus Hypercholesterolemia Bladder surgery [**2123**] Hernia repair [**2147**] Cholecystectomy [**2147**] Tracheal nodule debridement [**8-/2154**]   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the [**Hospital 18**] hospital for surgical debridement of a tracheal nodule that was contributing to your difficulty breathing.
After surgery you were found to have difficulty breathing and decreased oxygen levels that were thought to be a result of both the paralytic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] used during surgery as well as the possibility that you aspirated fluids into your trachea/lungs during surgery.
You were breathing stable at your baseline blood oxygen levels on the inpatient floor at rest, but were found to be significantly short of breath with activity.
2) Added Albuterol-Ipratropium inhaler.
Please take 1-2 PUFFs every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
No other changes were made to your at-home medications.
