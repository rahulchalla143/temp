She has been taking [**Hospital1 **] Tylenol for the headache with some relief.
The headaches would get better when she would lay down, and there would be no change with Valsalva maneuver.
She denied any photophobia or phonophobia (but her family says she would sit in a dark room with the headaches).
She denies diplopia, blurry vision, dysarthria, or dysphagia.
She denied any numbness, but reports she has had left arm and hand weakness even since before the mastectomy for which she receives PT.
Her family reports that she has also had memory loss, including losing her T pass and forgetting about a present she bought for a friend.
Head CT (preliminary read) showed at least two lesions in the right cerebral hemisphere consistent with mets and R to L shift.
Past Medical History: -Breast cancer s/p left mastectomy, radiation (last in [**5-25**]), and chemotherapy (last in [**12-26**]), receives care [**Location (un) 81132**] ([**Hospital3 **] in [**Location (un) 246**]), known metastases to the liver, bone, and lung (discovered in [**8-25**])  Social History: Social Hx: Patient lives alone with a cat.
Physical Exam: On Admission: O: T: 96.8  BP: 95/64   HR: 88  RR: 22  O2Sats: 100% on RA Genl: Awake, alert, NAD HEENT: Sclerae anicteric, no conjunctival injection, oropharynx clear CV: Regular rate, Nl S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops Chest: CTA bilaterally anteriorly and laterally, no wheezes, rhonchi, rales Abd: +BS, soft, NTND abdomen  Neuro: Mental status: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam, normal affect.
No dysarthria.
No right-left confusion.
No evidence of neglect.
Visual fields are full to confrontation, but may have slightly decreased vision in the right superior temporal quadrant.
Palate elevation symmetric.
Motor: Intermittent myoclonic jerks of the right upper extremity upon extension, no asterixis or tremor.
No pronator drift.
The largest in the right frontal lobe measures 3.3 x 2.8 cm and demonstrates a large amount of vasogenic edema with associated 1.5-cm shift of normally midline structures and leftward subfalcine herniation.
A 1.9 x 1.1 cm right parietal lesion adjacent to the posterior falx demonstrates moderate vasogenic edema.
A right occipital lesion measures 1.2 x 1.1 cm and demonstrates a moderate associated vasogenic edema.
The basilar cisterns are preserved without evidence of transtentorial or uncal herniation.
The bony calvarium is intact and there is no evidence of lesion that is suspicious for infection or metastasis in the calvarium or skull base.
IMPRESSION: Multifocal right hemisphere metastatic disease with and left subfalcine herniation and midline shift as noted above.
MRI Head [**12-8**]: FINDINGS: Multiple enhancing metastatic lesions identified, with the largest in the right frontal lobe, again with surrounding vasogenic edema and leftward subfalcine herniation, not significantly changed compared to prior study.
Enhancing left parietal lesion, along the falx, and left occipital lesion are also again identified.
There is no acute hemorrhage.
IMPRESSION: Multifocal metastatic disease, with leftward subfalcine herniation/shift not significantly changed compared to prior study.
There is evidence of residual blood products within the surgical bed as well as a post-surgical cavity, the previously identified metastatic lesion on the right frontal lobe apparently has been removed, vague pattern of enhancement is identified on the left frontal lobe (image #16, series #13).
The other two previously demonstrated metastatic lesions, one on the right occipital lobe and the second right parafalcine metastatic lesion are unchanged.
Similar pattern of vasogenic edema is demonstrated, minimal decrease in the midline shift towards the left, approximately 9.5 mm of deviation is demonstrated in the axial projection.
Persistent effacement and shift of the mid brain towards the left and uncal herniation, unchanged since the prior examination.
Resection of the right frontal metastatic lesion, vague pattern of enhancement is noted in the left frontal lobe as described above, follow-up is recommended.
Persistent mass effect and vasogenic edema with lesser degree of midline shift and persistent right uncal herniation.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 48 year old right handed woman with a history of breast cancer s/p left mastectomy, radiation, and chemotherapy with known metastases to the liver, bone, and lung who presented with a 1 month history of bitemporal headaches and a 2 week history of daily vomiting who was transferred from an OSH with head CT showing two lesions in the right cerebral hemisphere with midline shift consistent with metastases.
Given the extent of peri-turmoral edema and her deteriorating neurologic examination (she became progressively lethargic in the ED), she was taken for emergent resection.
On [**2145-12-8**] she had a right craniotomy for frontal tumor resection.
She tolerated the procedure well without complication.
Post-procedure MRI showed resection of the right frontal metastatic lesion, vague pattern of enhancement is noted in the left frontal lobe, two unchanged metastatic lesions: one on the right occipital lobe and the second right parafalcine in the convexity.
There was persistent mass effect and vasogenic edema with lesser degree of midline shift and persistent right uncal herniation.
Radiation oncology was consulted while she was admitted and advised whole brain radiation, but the patient preferred to follow up in [**Hospital3 **] where she has had her breast cancer treatment.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**5-27**] days (from your date of surgery) for a wound check.
