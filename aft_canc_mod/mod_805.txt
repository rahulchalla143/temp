Admission Date:  [**2145-5-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2145-6-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-7-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: EMERGENCY  Allergies: Lisinopril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2565**] Chief Complaint: Admission for transplant  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Tunnelled Central Line Placement  History of Present Illness:  69 y/o F with hx of AML with FLT3 mutation diagnosed in [**Month (only) 404**] of [**2145**] after she presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] with fatigue.
Currently, patient reports that she feels well, has no complaints and is anxious to start the treatment protocol.
ONCOLOGICAL HISTORY: From OMR admission note: Ms. [**Known lastname 20281**] is a 69-year-old woman with a past medical history significant for aortic valvular replacement for aortic stenosis in [**2143**] and venous occlusion of the retinal vein in [**10/2144**], who presented on [**2145-1-27**] to the [**Hospital 18**] [**Hospital 620**] campus with increasing fatigue and shortness of breath.
She had no fevers, chills, or night sweats, but noted some easy bruising.
She also had some visual changes with diplopia and blurry vision due to recent retinal vein occlusion.
Flow cytometry on [**2145-1-27**] from her peripheral blood showed a majority of the cells in the CD45 intermediate low side scatter blast region.
Immunophenotyping findings were consistent with involvement by acute myeloid leukemia with a peripheral smear revealing cup-like nuclei.
Her course was complicated by fever and neutropenia.
She also was noted for a drop in her ejection fraction to 20-25% on [**2145-2-14**], which was felt due to anthracycline use.
Her lisinopril was discontinued due to cough which has since resolved.
Ms. [**Known lastname 20283**] course was complicated by her deconditioning and depression regarding her diagnosis and conditioning.
As an outpatient, Ms. [**Known lastname 20281**] was noted for a drop in her platelet count.
Her Lovenox had been stopped due to her decreasing platelet count.
However, she was found to have a positive HIT antibody and was admitted for initiation of Argatroban therapy on [**2145-3-22**].
She had a repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy done on [**2145-3-18**] and [**2145-3-26**], both showing no evidence for patient's known leukemia, although the specimen on [**2145-3-26**] showed megakaryocytic hypoplasia.
She has been followed in the outpatient setting for transfusion support.
She had a repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2145-4-23**] which showed a hypocellular erythroid dominant bone marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis whit no evidence for acute leukemia.
Because of her known mutations, she is at high risk for recurrent leukemia and is in need of n allogeneic transplant.
2: Aortic valve replacement in [**4-/2143**] secondary to aortic stenosis.
History of hepatic cyst (noted on a preoperative workup for AVR and stable on imaging) - was concerning for an echinococcal cyst, and treated empirically with albendazole in [**10/2143**]; repeat CT from [**2145-2-16**] notes the cyst to be markedly smaller at 10.6 x 10.1 mm from 8.5 x 6.2 cm.
History of dysfunctional uterine bleeding.
Typhilitis during induction chemotherapy   Social History: Married, lives with her husband in [**Name (NI) 620**], originally from [**Name (NI) **], has 4 children, some live locally.
No FH of cardiac disease.
No history of leukemia or lymphoma.

CARDIOLOGY: TTE ([**6-13**]): Conclusions Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Aortic valve bioprosthesis without obvious vegetations.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
If clinically indicated, a TEE will better assess for valvular vegetations, especially in the presence of a prosthetic valve.
NEURO: EEG ([**5-/2145**]): This is an abnormal routine EEG due to a slow and poorly modulated background indicative of a moderate to severe encephalopathy.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There are no areas of prominent focal slowing although encephalopathies can obscure focal findings.
There are no epileptiform features.
No acute infarction.
Diffuse bilateral mastoid air cells disease, mucosal thickening and/or fluid and also in the pneumatized petrous apices.
While the presence of mucosal thickening and fluid does not by itself mean mastoiditis, to correlate clinically and with ENT examination to exclude infective mastoiditis and if necessary LP, based on clinical examination.
The left internal carotid artery flow void in the carotid canal is not clearly identifiable on the present study unclear if this is abnormal or related to the oblique orientation of the head.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted for allo-double cord transplant.
This is a 69 year old woman with AML, s/p 7+3, day 15 of non-myeloablative allogeneic double cord transplant, with PMH of bioprosthetic aortic valve, now in the ICU with worsening mental status, increasing oxygen needs, and evident fluid overload in the setting of acute renal failure and likely chronic heart failure as well as recent VRE bacteremia.
HYPOXIA:  Gradual increase in O2 requirement before transfer to MICU, with increasing evidence of fluid overload.
She was given high-dose Lasix followed by Lasix drip with minimal urine output.
However, on day of expiration EF was reduced to less 10% and she appeared to have cardiogenic shock.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 140s, compromising her forward flow and resulting blood pressure.
She had intermittent afib throughout her stay and was restarted on metoprolol.
HYPOTENSION: This was likely secondary to atrial fibrillation as well as a diffuse inflammatory response from engraftment causing mixed cardiogenic and distributive shock.
However, on day of death hypotension returned and was not responsive to multiple pressors and IVF.
At that time it appeared to be cardiogenic and septic in nature.
No evidence of vegetation on TTE or TEE.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  She had granular casts in urine and presumably ATN.
She was increasingly volume overloaded and oliguric.
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Prior to intubation the patient was altered in excess of her baseline anxiety.
Three days prior to death linezolid was changed to daptomycin due to suppressed cell counts.
Pt appeared to have a septic component on her final day.
She was given vitamin K. Seems out of proportion to liver impairment.
Likely contribution from poor nutritional status .
Transaminitis: LFTs increased slightly from yesterday, unclear significance but not likely hypoxic/shock, no new infections or toxic medication effect.
Became hypotensive and had afib with RVR.
Given fluid, 3 liters of NS, but BP only temporarily responded.
Pt had code blue with hypoxia and PEA arrest.
Hypoxia and hypotension continued once pulse returned.
