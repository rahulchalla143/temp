Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**5-3**] percutaneous drain placement  History of Present Illness: Following admission to an outside hospital, he was extensively fluid resuscitated, intubated due to respiratory distress, required vasopressor support, transfused 2 units of RBC for a Hct of 21.1, started on TPN and started on IV antibiotics Invanz and flagyl.
Past Medical History: Ulcerative colitis, osteoporosis, polyps, depression  Social History: non-contributory   Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: On admission T 98.5  HR 73  BP 96/59  RR 14  on CMV 0.4  500x12(5) Peep 5 sats 100% on vaso 2.4, propofol 20 Gen - intubated, sedated, ETT, OGT in place Card - RRR Pulm - Coarse bilaterally Abd - soft, mild distention, hypoactive bowel sounds, non tender Abdominal wound - healing, clean base, no surrounding erythema.
CT demonstrates moderate amount of fluid in the abdomen and pelvis, without definite loculated components or focal abscesses.
There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.
There is a right anterior abdominal wall ileostomy.
Small amount of gas is present in the anterior abdominal wall, compatible with recent postoperative state.
The gallbladder is mildly distended and contains hyperdense material, likely reflecting vicarious excretion of contrast.
After satisfactory position of the catheter was confirmed, approximately 70 cc of yellow minimally cloudy fluid was aspirated.
No immediate complications occurred.Radiology attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4401**],was present and supervised the entire procedure.
However, CT fluoroscopy images obtained during the procedure to confirm location of the guiding needle demonstrated significant rapid shift of fluid within the pelvis with only minimal amount of fluid remaining in the initially targeted left lower quadrant pocket.
Following this, the patient was repositioned twice to achieve better accumulation of fluid in the left lower quadrant.
Limited images through the lung bases demonstrate a moderate left pleural effusion and trace amount of right pleural fluid.
There is bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.
There is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Multiple liver cysts are identified and additional smaller subcentimeter hepatic hypodensities that are too small to characterize.
The spleen is mildly enlarged and measures approximately 14 cm in AP dimension.
There is no hydronephrosis.
There is a right anterior abdominal wall ileostomy.
Overall, there has been no significant interval change in amount of intra-abdominal fluid and peritoneal enhancement.
No definite focal loculated fluid collections are identified.
There is no evidence of gas within the intra- abdominal fluid.
There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.
There is no evidence of bowel pneumatosis.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
There is a healing fracture of the posterior tenth rib.
No significant interval change in the amount of intraperitoneal fluid.
No definite loculated fluid collections are identified.
There is no evidence of gas within the intraperitoneal fluid.
Moderate left pleural effusion and tiny right pleural effusion.
