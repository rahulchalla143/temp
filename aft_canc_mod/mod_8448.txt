Three days ago, he presented to the ED with 5 days of diffuse wheezing on exam.
During this ED visit, he was able to walk througout entire ED with only minimal desaturation, which is improved over even baseline (uses scooter at home).
He was diagnosed with a URI and was discharged on a Prednisone taper and when he presented today, he was on day #3 of his prednisone taper.
He presented 12/4/6 with one day of diffuse wheezing, dyspnea, and a dry cough.
Approximately ten minutes later, his systolic blood pressure dropped to 95/60 and his rhythm was atrial fibrillation with rapid RVR.
A CTA was negative for PE and a bedside echo showed some hypokinesis in the anterior wall.
He was paralyzed with 10mg vecuronium and 150 micrograms of fentanyl as he was dissyncronous with vent and was thought to be autopeeping.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Diagnosis of prostate cancer ([**2132**]).
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Cystic mass on MRI.
Atrial fibrillation 10.
No carotid bruits.
CV: irregularly irregular, normal S1/S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops Lungs: Bilateral breathsounds without wheezes, ronchi, or rales appreciated Abd: Soft, NABS, NT, ND, no HSM Ext: No edema, 2+ DP pulses bilaterally.

No evidence of pulmonary embolism with slightly malpositioned endotracheal tube and hyperinflated cuff, tip approximately 2 cm above carina.
6mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule with bilateral likely pleural-based soft tissue densities.
The pleural lesions appear stable when compared to prior chest x- rays however in combination with nodule and patient's history, a 3- month followup non- contrast chest CT is recommended.
Bilateral emphysematous changes with nonspecific right and left lower lobe patchy pulmonary opacities which may represent areas of pneumonitis or early pneumonia.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the basal one-half of the anterior septum and anterior wall, and of the basal inferior and inferolateral walls.
The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve is not well seen, but color Doppler interrogation reveals no significant aortic  regurgitation.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**11-30**] CT Abdomen/pelvis with contrast: .Partial or early small bowel obstruction with a transition point in the terminal ileum.
No obvious source of obstruction is identified.
Diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
Multifocal aspiration or atypical pneumonia in the lung bases.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Unchanged nonobstructing 3 mm stone in the right kidney.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit, where he was managed for COPD exacerbation (steroids), congestive heart failure, and superimposed MRSA (broad spectrum antibiotics).
He was intially tolerating a combination of Bi-PAP and FM after extubation [**2135-11-27**], but required re-intubation after acute desaturation on [**12-1**] thought to be secondary to a mucous plug.
He also had dark guaiac positive bowel movement on [**2141-12-3**] and again on [**12-5**] with Hct drop.
He received 3 units PRBC's on [**12-4**]; GI was consulted and recommended PPI therapy without invasive intervention in view of his respiratory status.
CT abdomen showed partial/early SBO on admission which subsequently resolved per serial examinations.
The patients atrial fibrillation with RVR was difficult to control required multiple nodal blocking agents including diltiazem gtt, metoprolol and digoxin.
In the setting of this, he developed demand ischemia.
The cardiology service was consulted, who recommended medical therapy in view of his ongoing multiple comorbidities.
The [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy and primary care physician met with the ICU team and, in view of pt's multiple ongoing co-morbidities and poor prognosis, decided to pursue comfort measures only.
