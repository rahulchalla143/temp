+ Nausea and vomiting x 1day.
Chronic low back pain is stable.
ED course: Patient spiked a fever to 101.6 rectally, treated with tylenol, Ceftriaxone 1g x 1 and Azithromycin 500mg x 1.

Chest: tachypneic, using accessory muscles; crackles [**3-2**] the way up bilaterally, no wheezes.
>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..          Alpha hemolytic colonies consistent with alpha streptococcus or          Lactobacillus sp.
Patchy opacity in the left retrocardiac region, which could represent an early focus of pneumonia.
Diffuse interstitial fibrosis.
No pneumothorax.

There is a diffuse bilateral reticulo- nodular pattern consistent with a known chronic interstitial fibrosis.
Discoid atelectases are present at the left base but no definite new confluent pulmonary consolidation and no pneumothorax.
CXR [**2108-2-2**]: Developing multifocal opacities possibly representing pneumonia.
CXR [**2108-2-3**]: Stable appearing multifocal opacities bilaterally, concerning for pneumonia.
There are bilateral diffuse parenchymal opacities with small pleural effusions without significant change since the previous exam.
The findings are suggestive of pneumonia superimposed on patient's known interstitial lung disease.
Although the heart size is within normal limits there may be an element of interstitial pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: # PNA: Ms. [**Known lastname **] likely had community acquired pneumonia.
She was ruled out for legionella and influenza, but was unable to provide an adequate sputum sample to determine causative organism.
She also likely had a component of pulmonary edema, as she had received 4L of IVF on admission due to her hypotension/sepsis.
She was given albuterol/atrovent nebs for her breathing and robitussin prn for her cough.
Despite receiving 4L of IVF in the ED, she remained hypotensive and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on levophed for BP support.
Blood and urine cultures from admission showed no growth.
# ILD: Ms. [**Known lastname **] has known interstitial lung disease, with her last pulmonary evaluation being in [**8-31**].
Per her primary outpt pulmonologist, she has been admitted multiple times in the past essentially for respiratory failure and has received steroids with improvement in her symptoms.
# CONJUNCTIVITIS: She developed conjuncitivitis and was treated with erythromycin ointment starting on [**2108-2-6**].
# PAIN MANAGEMENT: Ms. [**Known lastname **] had been on narcotics for chronic back pain as an outpatient but they were held after the patient was transferred to 11R as she began to develop an elevated bicarb and it was felt that the narcotics may be contributing to this.
Her pain was adequately controlled with tylenol and she was discharged without any narcotics.
UTI: Ms. [**Known lastname **] had a urine cx sent prior to discharge, from foley catheter, which grew enterococcus and gram positive bacteria, but she was asymptomatic at that time and still receiving cefpodoxime.
The decision was made to not give any further antibiotics at this time, but her family was told that if the patient developed symptoms of a UTI, to call her PCP for antibiotics for possible UTI.
# FEN: While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was kept NPO.
She had no history of GERD thus PPI was not indicated.
She was given a bowel regimen to prevent constipation while on narcotics.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
