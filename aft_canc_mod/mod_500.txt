Admission Date:  [**2194-8-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2194-9-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2138-2-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Demerol / Iodine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 15519**] Chief Complaint: Labile blood pressure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Arterial line placement [**8-29**]   History of Present Illness: 56F with h/o Stage IV Ovarian CA , recurrent DVTs, morbid obesity and HTN who was sent to the ED from Oncologist's office with Creatinine of 3.2 after five days out from an Abd CT with IV contrast on [**2194-8-25**] to evaluate for peritoneal mets.
She was also taking increasing doses of MSContin for pain as her kidney fxn was declining.
She has been mildly somnelent for few days PTA with occasional nausea and headache.
She does report decreased urine output over the past several days.
In ED, she did not have accurate blood pressure measurements secondary to her obesity and an inability to find an extra large BP cuff.
Systolic BPs were recorded from the 50s to the 160s, though she had no clinical evidence of hypotension.
Cardiology was called for Echo which revealed no evidence of tamponade, with nml EF.
A left radial A line was placed, she had persistent hypotension, with her blood pressure supported with pressors and IVF in the MICU.
Of note, she had a prompt response to Narcan, so it was thought her change in mental status was [**3-19**] both contrast nephropathy and a decreased ability to metabolize opioids while she was increasing her dose at home.
She was started on a heparin drip given her h/o UE DVT in the right axillary and subclavian veins, previously managed with lovenox.
A LE doppler on [**8-29**] demonstrated no DVTs.
Heme-onc also followed the pt, she is s/p 5 cycles of [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol with resistant disease and will be switched to Doxil per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15520**].
Diabetes mellitus type 2 2.
Stage IV ovarian/peritoneal CA dx'd [**5-20**] after presentation wtih new ascites and DOE, exudative pleural effusion returned as adenocarcinoma.
Morbid obesity 4.
H/o recurrent RLE DVTs following trauma to RLE, s/p IVC filter >6 yrs ago.
Hypertension 6.
Hypercholesterolemia 7.
Osteoporosis 8. s/p c  Past surgical history: s/p cholecystectomy s/p TAH (ovaries left in place) Has right port-o-cath  Social History: She used to work as a computer programmer.
NECK: Swelling or right arm swelling.
LUNGS: Show diminished breath sounds at the bases, left greater than right.
CARDIAC: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur, rub or gallop.
Exam limited by body habitus.
Neuro: Non-focal other than left eye esotropia and ptosis.
No papilledema.
Pertinent Results: CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is interval decrease in the left-sided pleural effusion with interval improved aeration of the left lung.
There is residual left-sided atelectasis.
Multiple calcified granuloma at the left lung base are again demonstrated and unchanged.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections are again demonstrated and not significantly changed in size or distribution compared to the prior study.
The appearance of a high density, thin, rim surrounding many of these collections is again seen and unchanged.
Multiple gastrohepatic ligament nodes measuring 11 and 12 mm in short axis diameter are stable.
No free air is seen.
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
CT Head: No obvious mass or midline shift or other evidence increased ICP.
CXR [**2194-9-3**]:  IMPRESSION: Resolving left lower lobe opacity which may relate to resolving atelectasis or improving pneumonia.
Persistent small left pleural effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 56F with h/o Stage IV Ovarian CA, recurrent DVTs, morbid obesity and HTN with acute renal failure [**3-19**] contrast nephropathy, and altered mental status [**3-19**] increasing opioid doses in setting of failing kidneys (kidneys not able to clear MSContin).
Acute renal failure, Contrast Nephropathy: Given temporal relationship to contrast study, we felt this was most likely contrast nephropathy.
Her FENa was calculated to be 0.4% which can be consistent with renovascular constriction from contrast in the setting of DM.
Her renal ultrasound was without evidence of obstruction.
Her Creatinine responded appropriately, and her renal function demonstrated a downward trend in creatinine.
Cardiovascuar/Hypotension: The etiology of her presenting hypotension was unclear, given she had no active infection and this was not a septic picture.
She had +MRSA sputum with ?PNA.
She did not have a pulsus parodoxicus or elevated JVP.
Change in Mental Status secondary to uremia vs oversedation, with decreased clearance of MSContin.
Her Head CT was wnl; and the pt was refusing MRI (to look for carcinomatous meningitis).
Pulmonary:  During her stay, she had a left pleural effusion with left lower lobe opacification, suggesting atelectasis versus consolidation on CXR.
This could be due to colonization vs. MRSA PNA.
Chronic anemia.
We followed serial HCTs, without need for transfusion.
Right dilated pupil: Question with regards to the chronicity as pt reports having this in the past, but it is not documented in prior notes.
Pt does not want further imaging studies despite our explaining our concern for increased intracranial pressure or carcinomatous meningitis.
RUE DVT: Dx with thrombus in right axillary and subclavian veins, previously managed with Lovenox.
