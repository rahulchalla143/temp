He was at home when 4 days prior to presentation he began to have worsened lower extremity and abdominal swelling.
He tried to treat with warming blankets without improvement.
He says that he has recently been treated with both lasix and spironolactone for his lower extremity swelling/ascites with minimal improvement.
At [**Hospital3 8544**] ED he had a pericentesis which showed 1750 white cells and was treated with Zosyn for SBP.
Patient has recurrent emesis x 1 and was treated with zofran.
Past Medical History: ONC HX: Diagnosed with metastatic renal cell cancer after he developed a lingering cough and dyspnea and was found to have loss of lung volume in the left lung in [**7-14**].
CT scan showed an obstructing lesion in his left main stem bronchus with atelectasis of his entire left lung.
CT scan of his torso as well as PET scanning showed lesions in his left kidney, left main stem bronchus, periaortic lymph node, and his thyroid.
On flexible bronchoscopy, performed on [**2123-9-1**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **], he underwent debulking of the endobronchial lesion and had resultant hemoptysis.
He had a successful tumor excision, tumor destruction of the left mainstem obstruction and placement of a 12 mm x 40 mm covered Ultraflex stent to achieve left lower lobe patency.
PMH: # metastatic papillary RCC as noted above.
# GERD # s/p appendectomy   Social History: He lives alone, is divorced, and has a 16-year-old daughter.
Family History: CAD and DM in father.
Physical Exam: VS: T: 96.7 P: 102 BP: 93/67 RR: 22 O2 sat: 100% on 4L GEN: cachectic, NAD HEENT: EOMI, anicteric, clear OP, MMM, neck supple Lungs: CTAB, decreased BS on the L, no w/r/r Heart: RRR, nl S1, S2, no m/r/g Abd: firm, distended, tender to light palpation, no rebound, no guarding, + 1 pitting edema Ext: + 2 pitting edema to knees bilaterally, cool to touch but +2 distal pulses Neuro: A&Ox3.
Small non-diagnostic Q waves in lateral leads.
Poor R wave progression which is non-diagnostic.
CXR [**2124-11-4**]: IMPRESSION: No significant interval change versus prior study with no new airspace disease.
Effusion and consolidation persistent on the left, the latter perhaps post-obstructive but superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Insufficient amount of ascites to perform paracentesis  CXR [**2124-11-6**]: IMPRESSION: Increasing opacification in the left hemithorax consistent with pleural fluid.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 57 M with PMH of metastatic papillary renal cancer on the phase II XL880 protocol who initially presented to [**Hospital3 8544**] with several days of worsened lower extremity swelling, abd pain, malaise, and vomiting, found to have SBP on paracentesis at [**Hospital **] transfered to ICU with worsening ARF and sepsis.
SBP / Sepsis / Hypotension: OSH records reported paracentesis consistent with SBP.
Other sources of infection include urine (WBC on UA), lungs (vomited with possible aspiration).
He also had a pleural effusion which was drained.
Acute renal failure: Most likely combination of obstruction and prerenal etiology.
Patient also had hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia.
Medications on Admission: celexa 60 mg PO QD oxycodone 5 mg PO q4-6 hours PRN pain sunitinib 50 mg PO daily x 28 days, then 14 days off toprol xl 100 PO QD verapamil 120 PO QD   Discharge Medications: expired  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: sepsis spontaneous bacterial peritonitis acute renal failure Renal cell carcinoma  Secondary: 1.
