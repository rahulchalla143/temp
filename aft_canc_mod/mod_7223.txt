Cardiac echo showed critical aortic stenosis with fairly normal left ventricular function with moderate mitral regurgitation.
Cardiac cath demonstrated confirmed presence of critical aortic stenosis with clean coronaries.
Past Medical History: Aortic stenosis Congestive heart failure with preserved EF Hypertension CVA Hypothyroidism Rheumatoid arthritis Glaucoma Ulnar neuropathy  Social History: Smoked 1ppd for about 20yrs, quit 50yrs ago.
LUNGS: Clear HEART: RRR, III/VI systolic murmur ABD: Soft, nontender, nondistended, NABS EXT: [**1-12**]+ Pulses, no edema, no varicosities NEURO: Nonfocal  Discharge A/O x3 nonfocal Pulm CTAB Cardiac RRR Sternal inc: no drainage, no erythema Abd soft, NT, ND Ext warm, trace edema  Pertinent Results: CXR [**12-21**]: The patient is status post median sternotomy, the AVR.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right are unchanged.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe (3+)mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
Trace aoric insufficiency seen that resolved with protamine.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation persists.

Given the abnormailties seen on her most recent CT scan, the thoracic surgical service performed a flexible bronchoscopy during her operation.
She developed atrial fibrillation which responded to beta blockade.
