Admission Date:  [**2192-5-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**2192-5-16**]  Date of Birth:   [**2136-10-8**]     Sex:  F  Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55-year-old female with a  history of metastatic colon CA who was transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] for pericardiocentesis.
The patient reports a two to three week history of shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain, which started all of a sudden, was not associated with any concurrent illnesses.
Since this time, the patient continued to experience shortness of breath, marked dyspnea on exertion, and overall fatigue.
In the Emergency Department, the patient was noted to have supraventricular tachycardia and shortness of breath.
Evaluation at [**Hospital3 3583**] revealed a large pericardial effusion and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for pericardiocentesis.
The patient was noted to have equalization of diastolic pressures.
The patient was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service for concern of constricted pericarditis.
Upon examination, the patient continued to complain of left-sided pleuritic chest pain.
The patient also reported dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea.
The patient also complained of palpitations and lightheadedness.
The patient reports relief of shortness of breath upon sitting up.
Colon cancer diagnosed in [**2187**] with liver mets.
The patient also had liver resection for metastases.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Her mother had a history of coronary artery disease and colon CA.
Her father had a history of coronary artery disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  There is no temperature recorded at admission.
General:  The patient was a well-developed, well-nourished female lying in bed in mild respiratory distress.
Jugular venous distention was not assessed as the patient was supine status post procedure.
Extremities: There was no clubbing or cyanosis.
EKG on admission revealed sinus tachycardia at 95 beats per minute, nonspecific T wave inversions in the lateral leads.
There were no PR depressions noted.
From the outside hospital, the patient also had one tracing with atrial fibrillation and one with bigeminy.
Echocardiogram from the outside hospital revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55% with 1+ MR, small to moderate pericardial effusion without tamponade.
A chest CT performed on [**2192-5-6**] from the outside hospital revealed a large pericardial effusion, right pleural effusion, small left-sided pleural effusion, right lower lobe atelectasis, and hepatomegaly with biliary stent.
ASSESSMENT:  The patient is a 55-year-old female with metastatic colon CA without known coronary artery disease presenting with progressive dyspnea on exertion, shortness of breath, and palpitations secondary to pericardial effusion with organization complicated by tamponade who underwent unsuccessful pericardiocentesis.
Thus, the patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service for the concern of constrictive pericarditis.
PERICARDIAL EFFUSION/CONSTRICTIVE PERICARDITIS:  Given the concern of ongoing pericardial effusion and constrictive pericarditis, the CT Surgery Service was consulted for evaluation of pericardial window or pericardial stripping procedure.
For further evaluation and to better define the effusion, the patient underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram which revealed a continuous moderate effusion with right ventricular and right atrial clot.
The patient also underwent a cardiac MRI which revealed tethering of the pericardium, suggestive of constriction, with small semisolid effusions.
Intraoperative findings reported a very thickened pericardium that appeared inflamed.
There was no obvious tumor nodules.
There was serous fluid seen within the pericardium, measures at approximately 150 to 200 cc.
In the left pleural space, there was a pleural effusion that was noted to be serous.
There was unsuccessful drainage of the right-sided pleural effusion.
However, the patient was still with constrictive pericardial disease.
The patient is at risk of subacute tamponade given constrictive pericarditis.
Her blood pressure remained stable without any evidence of compromise.
At the time of dictation, pathology of pericardial tissue remains pending.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  The patient was noted to have atrial fibrillation at the outside hospital and was started on an Amiodarone load.
The hospital course at the [**Hospital6 1760**] was complicated by recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation.
While continuing on this regimen, the patient continued to experience episodes of atrial tachycardia; however, the patient overall remained well controlled.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Status post procedure, the patient developed bilateral crackles on examination with peripheral edema secondary to perioperative fluid resuscitation.
The patient continues to have CHF at the time of discharge.
Home VNA should assist in monitoring of daily weights and I&Os until the patient is no longer with signs of heart failure.
ONCOLOGY:  The patient has a history of metastatic colon cancer.
PAIN:  Upon admission, the patient experienced focal left-sided chest pain thought to be secondary to pericardial disease and effusion.
The patient was transitioned on a PCA Dilaudid strip for pain control.
However, the patient displayed decreased mental status on the Fentanyl patch and subsequently Fentanyl was discontinued.
q. six to eight hours given for pericardial disease.
Constrictive pericarditis.
Metastatic colon cancer.
Chronic pain.
Atrial fibrillation.
The patient should record the [**Doctor Last Name **] of Heart at times of events and also one time q.a.m.
