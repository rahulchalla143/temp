Per discussion with Pharmacy, Amlodipine has been reported to be associated with angioedema, but this was felt less likely than the increase in Lisinopril to be the cause.
If he continues to be hypertensive, it was discussed in the ICU that he should try Chlorthalidone, or Metoprolol switched to Labetalol or Carvedilol for alpha-adrenergic blocking effects.
Type II diabetes: Pt had elevation in his blood sugars likely due to steroid effect, and he was given Humalog sliding scale for control instead of his home Metformin/Glyburide.

We think this may be due to a recent increase in your Lisinopril; however it's possible that Irbesartan or Amlodipine may have caused this.
There's no way to be 100% sure, so we have held these medications and they have been added to your allergy list, because if you are re-exposed to these meds, you could have a more serious allergic reaction with the risk of serious injury or death.
