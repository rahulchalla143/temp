She reported significant chronic discomfort from her very enlarged uterus including pain with bending and movement.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Seizure disorder with her last seizure in [**2106**] and her current dose of Dilantin at 100 mg po b.i.d.
as well as an environmental allergic reaction for which she took daily Zyrtec.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] underwent a supracervical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and evaluation of her left ureter to confirm left ureteral patency on [**2117-11-19**].
Because her surgery involved a longer time period and transfusion of 2 units of blood she was taken to the Intensive Care Unit for overnight observation and management of fluid levels.
Her pain was initially managed with a Dilaudid PCA pump, but by postoperative day four her pain was in control with Motrin and an occasional percocet.
She remained afebrile throughout her maximum temperature being 100.4 on postop day one and thereafter she had no temperatures above 100 degrees.
for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis and pneumoboots.
The left ureter had a 3 mm intentional ureterotomy, which had been oversewn after the antegrade cystogram with 4-0 vicryl.
On postop day three the Foley catheter was removed for the first time from the bladder and immediately after removing the Foley catheter we noticed increased output of the pelvic JP drain from a scant level the day before up to 300 cc within four hours.
Because of that abrupt increase in the JP drain output right after removal of the Foley the Foley catheter was placed back into the bladder and the serosanguinous drainage from the JP drain as well as the urine were both sent for creatinine values.
On two separate occasions the serosanguinous output from the JP drain had a creatinine of .4 consistent with peritoneal fluid.
At this time the patient has normal return of her bowel and her bladder function.
The Foley catheter was again removed last night and she has voided spontaneously with minimal post void residuals based on ultrasound scanning.
and she has not had a seizure since [**2106**] despite the low Dilantin levels.
[**Known firstname **] will have an appointment to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9734**] in another two days for staple removal and a wound check.
She will have an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4229**] of the Urology Service in one month for a renal ultrasound.
