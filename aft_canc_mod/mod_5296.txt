Admission Date:  [**2128-1-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-1-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2081-11-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4219**] Chief Complaint: 46 M w/ h/o metastatic colorectal CA with widespread mets including spinal mets w/ h/o radiographic cord compression at T5 p/w sensation/sensory changes below the nipple line corresponding to the T5 level, and progressive lower extremity weakness.
Multiple thoracic laminotomies.
History of Present Illness: 46 M with h/o metastatic colorectal CA and prior radiation to the spine who has sudden onset of sensation changes from the nipple level down and loss of ability to ambulate after a fall.
There is a dominant lesion at approximately T5 in the right posterior/lateral pedicle and invading into the spinal cord.
There are areas of metastatic disease throughout the spine.
Per patient report, he and neurosurgery were hesitant to operate because of his low platelet count previously.
Followed by Radiation Oncology at [**Hospital6 204**](Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] -- Falls -- s/p humeral fracture (bilat) s/p ORIF -- Thrombocytopenia (platelet count on admit [**12-31**] to LGH 12) -- Ulcerative colitis   Social History: Married w/ 3 children, former home constructor, no tob, rare ETOH.
Family History: GM with breast CA GF with skin CA  Physical Exam: On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] 97.5 110/70 70 20 97% RA patient lying in bed in NAD OP clear without evidence of bleeding or oral lesions neck supple Regular nl S1 S2 no MRG CTA bilaterally soft NT/ND +BS colostomy site c/d/i no HSM +staples along left humerus with bruising down left arm to hands, no swelling, staple site c/d/i Upper extremity strength 5/5 bilaterally LE weak bilaterally Decreased sensation to light touch below the nipple level  Pertinent Results: Imaging: [**2128-1-20**] RUQ U/S - Limited study.
Multiple likely metastatic lesions in the liver.
No biliary ductal dilation.
Gallbladder suboptimally visualized, but no evidence to suggest cholecystitis.
[**2128-1-20**] CT Head - Probable metastatic lesions bilaterally in the deep frontal white matter.
Multiple lytic and sclerotic lesions involving the skull, skull base, and cervical spine, highly suspicious for metastases.
There is no pleural effusion.
Expansile left lower posterior rib and pleural thickening around healed left lateral rib fracture are unchanged.
[**2128-1-20**] MRI - Skull base metastatic foci, including a locale adjacent to the right trigeminal ganglion.
Status-post cingulotomies, but no evidence for brain parenchymal metastases  Cultures: [**2128-1-19**] Blood - pending [**2128-1-19**] Urine - contaminated [**2128-1-19**] Blood - pending [**2128-1-17**] Blood - no growth [**2128-1-17**] Urine - enterococcus [**2128-1-19**] Blood - NGTD [**2128-1-19**] Urine - NGTD   Brief Hospital Course: At [**Hospital6 204**], lumbar CT scan showed diffuse osteopenia and lesions at L4-5 with compression fracture at L1 and fracture at L5.
Neurosurgery (OSH) felt he was not a good operative candidate secondary to his thrombocytopenia, he was transferred here for possible gamma knife treatment.
He was started on tequin 400 mg IV qd for his bandemia.
He received decadron 6mg IV q 6 hours for cord compression.
By POD #3, patient continued to improve, was out of bed sitting in a chair and pain [**Last Name (un) 19692**] well controlled with a PCA.
On [**2128-1-10**] patient was transfused 2 units of PRBC for hematocrit = 22 and symptomatic with tachycardia.
He recovered well until [**1-11**] when he developed SOB/CP/EKG changes and was transferred to the ICU.
He was noted to have an epidrual hematoma and underwent I and D on [**1-12**] (POD 3).
The hemovac drain was d/c'd [**1-14**] and he has had no further bleeding episodes.
From a cord compression standpoint, he remained stable s/p laminectomy and epidural hematoma evacuation.
His bilateral asymetrical LE motor deficits improved slowly with physical therapy.
He was originally on a PCA for pain control.
We were able to successfully switch the patient to a fentanyl patch with liquid oxycodone for breakthrough pain.
A CT head was ordered to evaluate for any signs of metastatic disease.
It showed numerous skull mets, but no parychemal involvement.
There were skull mets close to the trigeminal nucleus but it remained unclear if this was the cause of his pain.
The patient also had new findings of horners syndrome.
They requested MRI imaging of the orbits and an LP to look for spread of the cancer to the CSF.
He was started on neurontin for the trigeminal neuralgia but it was discontinued because it was not providing relief.
He was treated with vanco and switched to levo when sensitives showed pansensitive enterococcus UTI.
He continued to spike fevers which were eventually attributed to hematoma breakdown (he had numerous large hematoma throughout his body).
He had the extensive hematoma formation at his surgical site with a platelet count of 24.
The patient also was anemia which again was thought to be multi-factorial from: 1) bone marrow suppression from XRT and chemotherapy (note retic=0.6) 2) anemia of chronic disease (note alb=2.8) 3) peri-operative blood loss 4) marrow infiltration by cancer (significant bony destruction on imaging, although no nucleated RBCs on smear).
There was concern that the patient might have been hemolyzing because his labs showed an elevated LDH, low haptoglobin, and increased bilirubin.
Because the patients TBil continued to rise, a RUQ U/S was obtained and showed multiple liver mets.
The primary oncologist confirmed that these lesions were new.
He showed no signs of biliary obstruction.
Because of the new metastatic disease that was identified in the skull and liver, we consulted [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2270**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1764**] to discuss hospice care.
The patient was made aware that his disease had progressed and there may not be any further treatement available.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
