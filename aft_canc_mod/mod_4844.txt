Large posterior osteophytes and PLL ossification at C3-C4 causing significant narrowing of the spinal canal in the setting of trauma, cord contusion cannot be excluded and if focal neurologic deficit, a MR for further evaluation is recommended.
There is sever spinal canal narrowing at multiple levels.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Slight interval increase in hematoma abutting the right posterior pleura.
Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions.
The density of the right effusion is suggestive of a hematoma or hemothorax.
Stable appearance to thoracic and posterior right rib and transverse spinous process fractures.
Right superior scapular fracture is now evident, but was not imaged on the prior examination.
Otherwise no new fractures.
Horseshoe kidney configuration.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Severe narrowing of the spinal canal at C3-4 and C4-5.
Additional variable multilevel spinal canal and neural foraminal narrowing of the cervical spine as described above.
Questionable acute bone marrow edema involving the T11 vertebral body.
Multilevel degenerative changes of the lumbar spine without high-grade neural foraminal or spinal canal narrowing.
Slight decrease in small perifalcine SDH.
Moderate paranasal sinus disease.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated in the Emergency Room by the Trauma service then admitted to the Trauma ICU for close monitoring, frequent neuro checks and pulmonary toilet as well as pain control.
His GCS on admission was 15 however he soon became very agitated and eventually required intubation and sedation to keep him calm.
His chest xray showed a large right pleural effusion and he had a chest tube placed which drained about 1 liter of blood.
He had a small subdural hematoma and subsequent head Ct's showed no increase.
After he was weaned and extubated from the respirator he was able to follow simple commands but unfortunately his episodes of agitation were treated with Ativan and this seemed to cause over sedation.
The geriatric service was consulted to assist in balancing his medications in light of his Parkinson's disease.
The Orthospine service recommended a TLSO brace with a cervical extension for his multiple thoracic vertebral fractures and his C7 fracture.
His chin developed a stage 1 pressure ulcer and that prompted a consult to the skin care nurse.
Following extubation from the respirator on [**2189-3-19**] his chest tube was removed and he was kept in the ICU for persistent episodes of agitation and delirium.
He had a speech and swallow evaluation and failed secondary to aspiration therefore a dobhoff feeding tube was placed and remains in place,  Hopefully as his mental status improves the study can be repeated.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was making some progress and his agitation is controlled with increased doses of Seroquel at HS and a low dose in the AM.
His pain is controlled with Oxycodone and Tylenol and he has been able to get out of bed to a chair with Physical Therapy as long as his pain is controlled.
His foley catheter was removed on [**2189-3-25**] but replaced the same day due to urinary retention.

Acute blood loss anemia Secondary diagnoses 1.
Hypertension 2.
Dementia 4.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.

Any confusion, lethargy or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
New onset of the loss of function, or decrease of function on one whole side of your body.
