Admission Date:  [**2120-2-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-2-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2049-2-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**] Chief Complaint: Hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 year old man with CLL, known lung masses and recent brochial artery bleed, s/p embolization of LLL bronchial artery [**1-17**], who presents with hemoptysis.
He was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab [**2-1**] after an extended admission for hemoptysis during which he underwent rigid broncoscopy demonstrating no endobronchial source followed by angiography showing a bleeding LLL bronchial artery, which was successfully embolized.
He was also diagnosed with HAP during that admission, and treatment with vanc/cefepime was begun [**1-28**].
Hemoptysis and infectious symptoms resolved, and he was discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
The day of transfer, he again developed hemoptysis of unclear volumes.
IP saw him in the ED and felt that, given no visualization of endobronchial source at the time of recent scope, it would be more useful to go directly to IR for repeat guided embolization.

Small left pleural effusion and increased atelectasis.
CT Head [**2120-2-9**] - There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline structures, or evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarct.
CT Chest [**2120-2-9**] - Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions, small bilaterally, but left greater than right.
New heterogeneous opacities at the right lung base could represent atelectasis or the sequela of aspiration.
No lobar consolidation.
Unchanged appearance of large mediastinal and perihilar masses bilaterally, with attenuation of the adjacent airways.
No new masses.
There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures, or acute major vascular territorial infarction.
The ventricles and sulci are prominent, compatible with age-related volume loss.
Inferior right mastoid air cells are partially opacified.
There is global hypokinesis.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 year old male with known CLL presents with hemoptysis in setting of known LLL mass; now s/p embolization of bronchial artery with recurrent hemoptysis.
# Hemoptysis - Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the hospital for hemoptysis noted while at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab facility.
While in the ICU, he underwent flexible bronchoscopy that showed recurrent massive hemoptysis from left lower lobe which had subsided with no signs of active bleeding.
He underwent XRT without complications.
He had no repeat hemoptysis during his admission.
# Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure (x 2): Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**2120-2-14**] for respiratory failure.
Differential included flash pulmonary edema vs. acute intrapulmonary hemorrhage vs compressive pathology of airways from mediastinal lymphadenopathy/inflammation from XRT vs. mucous plugging.
HCT remained stable, no evidence of hemoptysis.
No evidence of worsening infection.
After transfer from ICU to BMT service floor, Rabbi [**Known lastname **] had repeat episode of acute hypoxic respiratory failure associated with SBP=200.
# Altered Mental Status: Rabbi [**Known lastname **] was sedated in the ICU due to being intubated.
After discontinuation of all sedating medications, he was noted to only be oriented to self, intermittantly agitated as well as difficulty verbally expressing himself.
Initially felt to be delirium and drug side effects, however altered mental status continued despite no sedating medications.
Neurology consult felt possible delirium vs. intracranial process (mets, annoxic injury, infection, seizure).
After initial hypoxic respiratory failure prompting transfer to ICU, patient underwent EEG which showed  mild to moderate encephalopathy.
CT head was negative for acute intracranial process x 2.
Prior to Rabbi [**Known lastname 24239**] passing, there was no clear determination of the etiology of his altered mental status.
# Tachypnea - Rabbi [**Known lastname **] started to have tachypnea approximately 7-10 days into his hospitalization.
ABG were consistent with primary respiratory alkalosis.
# CLL: After hemoptysis stopped and patient extubated, he a was transferred to the BMT service for further treatment.
During these treatments, he had XRT to the large mediastinal CLL mass as well.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have troponin leak during his initial presentation as well as during his acute hypoxic respiratory failure episodes.
There was concern that he was volume overloaded during his first hypoxic episode and was diuresed, however on second hypoxic episode he had no sign of total body volume overload.
Hypotension was likely due to a combination of positive pressure ventilation and medication effect, less likely significant hemodynamic loss into thorax or adrenal infufficiency given relatively low (physiologic) home dose of prednisone.
# Recent HAP:  Vancomycin and cefepime were continued on admission until [**2-5**] to complete antibiotic course for hospital acquired pneumonia from previous admission.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr elevated to 1.4 (baseline 1.0-1.2) on admission, likely secondary to hypotension.
# Diabetes Mellitus Type II - Mr. [**Known lastname **] was placed on QID fingersticks and sliding scale insulin.
