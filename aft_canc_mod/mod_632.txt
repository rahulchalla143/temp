Pt was having episodes of syncope at home and some abdominal pain, went to his outpt oncologist's office for chemotherapy (C1D8 Gemcitabine/Cisplatin) where he was noted to have a BP of 75/56 and Hct was 17 and thus pt was sent to the ED.
CT abd showed pneumobilia [**12-17**] cholecystoenteric fistula.
GI has been following who performed an EGD which showed ulcers in stomach and duodenal bulb as well as a larger ulcerated region at the junction of duodenal bulb and second part of duodenum on the posterior wall of the duodenum with adherent clot, suggestive of possible tumor eroding the small bowel wall.
Since, pt continued to bleed, pt underwent an IR procedure today, where no active bleeding was seen and the gastroduodenal artery was embolized.
Endorses some mild pain in abdomen, but much better from admission.
States he continues to have dark red stools.
Admits to occasional shortness of breath but denies fevers or cough.
ROS: per HPI, endorses 20 lb weight loss in last 6 months.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - [**6-/2104**] pt referred to Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] for microscopic hematuria, found to have abnormal digital rectal exam with nodularity adjacent to the right prostate and the right seminal vesicle - [**2104-7-22**] cystoscopy showed normal bladder mucosa except for >2 cm calculus protruding from a diverticulum between the right urothelial orifice and bladder neck.
- [**2104-9-11**] prostate biopsy showed invasive high-grade carcinoma involving the prostatic stroma and extraprostatic adipose tissue, one core showed prostatic adenocarcinoma, [**Doctor Last Name **] score 3+3.
- [**2104-10-16**] cystoprostatectomy and ileal conduit.The final pathology examination showed invasive urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma arising from the bladder diverticulum and extending into the perivesicular adipose tissue, prostate gland and right seminal vesicle.
The tumor greatest dimension was 5.5 cm, high-grade, pT4a; two of the five regional lymph nodes were positive for metastasis (pN2), the margins were uninvolved by carcinoma, but there was extensive lymphovascular invasion and perineural invasion.
Peripheral vascular disease 3.
Family History: father died of colon cancer at age 60.  mother with breast cancer at age [**Age over 90 **] s/p lumpectomy.
Physical Exam: VS: Temp: 96.8  BP: 118/63  HR: 94   RR: 22  O2sat  99% on RA GEN: pale, weak, NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, pale conjunctivae, OP clear RESP: CTAB with good air movement throughout CV: RRR, no m/r/g ABD: soft, mild diffuse ttp in abdomen EXT: no c/c/e NEURO: AAOx3.
No sensory deficits.
The patient has diffuse nodules presumably from metastatic disease.
Conceivably, there could be early consolidation of the right lower lung; however, the increased opacity is felt more likely due to differences in technique, inspiratory effort, and resultant ronchovascular crowding.
[**12-23**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Likely fistulous communication between the first portion of the duodenum and the gallbladder which may be from ulceration or inflammation of previously seen duodenal diverticulum.
High-density material within the gallbladder lumen likely represents clot/blood.
Bilateral moderate-to-severe hydronephrosis, left worse than right.
Multiple pulmonary metastases as described on prior studies.
Multiple intramuscular metastases as described above.
[**12-26**] mesenteric angiogram   Brief Hospital Course: This is a 66 yo male with h/o metastatic bladder ca to liver, lung on chemo who originally presented on [**2104-12-23**] from clinic with hypotension and Hct of 17, has been in SICU getting blood transfusions, then transferred to MICU for further management as pt is not a surgical candidate.
IR performed IR embolizations with no success in stabilizing the bleeding.
However, continued to require transfusions and shows active bleeding.
Per IR recs, pt underwent a tagged RBC scan which showed active bleeding in GDA territory and pt underwent IR embolization again on [**2104-12-26**].
#  Metastatic bladder cancer/cholecystoenteric fistula: Pt was maintained on Unasyn to cover any possible GI infections.
Pain was controlled with Dilaudid PRN.
