Admission Date:  [**2192-12-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2192-12-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2119-4-22**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73-year-old male with history of atrial fibrillation, chronically infected fistula tract in his left hip who presents with three to four day history of fatigue, malaise, tachypnea, anorexia, decreased po intake and watery diarrhea of six to seven bowel movements per day.
He was in his usual state of good health until approximately one week prior to admission when he noted watery diarrhea without cramping, blood, melena, however, he did complain of dry heaves and anorexia.
Two to three days prior to admission, he noted increasing dyspnea, cough, production of yellow nonbloody sputum and subjective fevers.
He attempted to keep up with his fluid loss by a po intake, however, on the day of admission complained of dry mouth and decreased urine output.
He was hypotensive at 70/30, however, he responded to intravenous fluids and oxygen.
Initial electrocardiogram showed atrial bigeminy but repeat was in sinus tachycardia.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Patient denies exertional chest pain, melena, bright red blood per rectum, hematuria, obstructive voiding symptoms.
Denies recent increase in drainage of his left hip sinus.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, basal cell carcinoma of his right anterior shin, atrial fibrillation, motor vehicle accident in [**2140**], complicated by left hip fracture, status post rod placement, chronic methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus infection on suppressive dicloxacillin.
Last documented in [**2186**] to be methicillin sensitive Staph aureus.
[**2189**] echocardiogram showed mild left atrial enlargement, ejection fraction greater than 55%, mild aortic regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation, normal pulmonary artery pressures, hypercholesterolemia and status post appendectomy.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat showed pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodations.
There was no lymphadenopathy, 8 cm jugular venous distention.
Lungs:  Left lung showed rhonchus breath sounds, but good air movement.
Right lung decreased breath sounds at the bottom one half of lung fields.
Extremities showed no edema and cyanosis.
Left hip fistula drainage tract was draining serosanguinous fluid.
There was no odor, no pus, no erythema.
Urinalysis was amber, cloudy 1.030, small blood, greater than 32 protein, small bilirubin, urobilinogen was 1.0 with no cells.
First electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 108, left axis deviation, QRS at .144, poor R wave progression, persistent S in V6, T wave inversion in V2, V3.
Nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay.
Chest x-ray showed large right lower lobe infiltrate with volume loss, small pleural effusion on right.
Patchy infiltrates in the left lower lobe, however, could still see the left hemidiaphragm.
This 73-year-old male was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with severe community acquired pneumonia.
Hematology:  The patient was noted to be in mild DIC as evidenced by elevated PTT on admission, however, his platelets were fine.
There was no evidence of consumptive coagulopathy.
Pulmonary:  Patient with tobacco history and severe community acquired pneumonia.
Sputum cultures were repeatedly sent which did not grow out a predominance of any specific respiratory pathogen.
His small right side effusion was tapped which was shown to be exudative with a pH of 7.35, 2.6 grams of total protein, 112 glucose, 279 LDH.
A bronchoscopy was performed which showed normal airways, sputum in the right lower lobe and right middle lobe.
At this point, there was some concern given his low P-F ratio, that he had possibly progressed to acute lung injury and/or adult respiratory distress syndrome, however, it was likely he remained just with significant community acquired pneumonia.
On the fifth hospital day, Infectious Disease consult recommended a CT to evaluate further for processes as he remained without microbiological diagnosis.
This showed extensive alveolar consolidation involving nearly the entire right lung and to a lesser degree the left lower lobe.
Heterogeneous enhancement attenuation suggested necrotizing pneumonia, though, no abscesses are evident at this time.
Multiple predominantly ill-defined nodules throughout the remaining irradiated lobes most likely areas of early consolidation, however, follow-up CT after appropriate antibiotic therapy and serial chest x-ray are recommended to exclude true lung nodules.
Pleural calcification on the left lower hemithorax and tiny right posterior pleural calcification, question of history of asbestosis exposure, right adrenal lesion measuring 2 cm, possibly an adenoma.
Patient was again bronched on the fifth hospital day which showed edematous airway.
Infectious Disease:  The patient was started on vancomycin and levofloxacin for community acquired pneumonia and concern that it was colonized to the Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus given his chronic methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus infection and suppressive dicloxacillin.
Cardiovascular:  The patient was in atrial fibrillation with stable ventricular response throughout the hospitalization until the night of intubation, the third hospital night, when he went to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response which broke easily with 10 mg of diltiazem.
Echocardiogram obtained the next day showed mild left atrial enlargement, however, showed global left ventricular hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 25-30% where as it had been greater than 55% in [**2189**].
Also noted on the second echocardiogram was a focal apical right ventricular akinesis.
Based on this, it was felt that patient was not in fact fluid overloaded and congestive heart failure was not a component to his poor oxygenation.
When the pathology from the lung biopsy came back positive for adenocarcinoma of the lung, the family made the patient "Do Not Resuscitate" and approximately three hours later, patient had a decreased response to pressors on 100% FIO2 and he passed away at 6 p.m. on [**2192-12-17**].
