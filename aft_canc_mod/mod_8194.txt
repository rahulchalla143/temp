[**Hospital **] hospital course was complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, episode of hypoxia,ICU transfer, post-operative ileus and UTI.
*) Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: This was first noted on day of admission, [**2157-8-4**], when patient was in the OR prior to surgery, case was cancelled and patient was transferred to the floor, evaluated by cardiology and started on PO metoprolol dosing, at which point she spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm.
Patient underwent a TTE the following day which showed normal global and regional biventricular systolic function with mild mitral regurgitation with good rate control, and cardiology reported no contraindications to surgery.
Post operatively,  atrial fibrillation with RVR recurred on [**2157-8-7**], requiring diltiazem 45 mg IV and metoprolol 15 mg IV dosing, as well as diltiazem PO 30 mg PO QID, on top of metoprolol dosing already being given.
The diltiazem drip was stopped and Ms [**Known lastname 1005**] continued to be tachycardic and was unable to be controlled with verapimil drip.
After over 24 hours in sinus rhythm patient converted back to afib with RVR however again was asymptomatic and patient started back on PO Metoprolol 100mg TID and spontaneously converted back to sinus rhythm after 8 hours.
Patient had two more episodes of afib with RVR during hospital stay, patient was asymptomatic through all episodes of afib with RVR.
Digoxin was stopped by cardiology as was felt to have little effect.
*) Ileus: Patient developed nausea and vomiting and KUB consistent with ileus on post operative day 3 while in ICU.
Patient's symptoms improved with NGT.
*) Urinary Tract Infection: On post operative day 9 patient reported urinary frequency and urgency as well as multiple episodes of incontinence.
*) Hypoxia: Patient developed hypoxia with oxygen saturations at 88% RA on post-op day 2.

*) Low urine output: Pt developed low urine output while in ICU.
