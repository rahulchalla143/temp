Given her extensive cardiac history and elevated enzymes at presentation, a Cardiology consult was obtained on [**8-30**] for management recommendations; active infarction was ruled out.
Pt was made floor status on [**9-4**], and was also noted to ooze venous blood from her L femoral cath site.
[**9-5**] the bleeding was stitched at the bedside, but rebled the following day; it was finally controlled by d/c'ing the heparin when INR>1.5, and DSG with surgicell and pressure.
Pt was placed on a short course of Levoquin the day on [**9-5**] prophylacticly for the bleed's proximity to the underlying vascular construction.
Pt was kept in house until her HCT>28, INR>1.5 and hemostasis was acheived at the cath site.
