Admission Date:  [**2120-11-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-11-29**]   Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4679**] Chief Complaint: The patient is an 83-year-old gentleman referred to the thoracic clinic for newly diagnosed esophageal cancer.
The patient states that he has had gastroesophageal reflux disease for many years that he had self-medicated by milk and over-the-counter antacids.
In the setting of a knee infection five years ago, he underwent a surveillance endoscopy that according to the patient showed [**Last Name (un) **] esophagus.
No endoscopic followup was recommended by the gastroenterologist; however, this past month the patient's primary care physician upon reviewing his medical record recommended a followup endoscopy.
Random biopsies were taken during this endoscopy that showed multiple areas of high-grade dysplasia with a focus of adenocarcinoma.
During that procedure, Barrett's esophagus was noted to 26 cm from the incisors, an the area of ulceration of the esophageal mucosa was noted proximally in the mid thoracic esophagus.
Endoscopic ultrasound revealed a mass at this area that involved the musculus propria.
There were two small but suspicious appearing periesophageal lymph nodes and therefore endoscopic ultrasound stage was T2N1.
Of note, biopsy nor FNA of the suspicious lymph node was performed during this procedure, as the lymph node was adjacent to the area of mucosal abnormality.
The CT showed no obvious mass in esophagus.
There was noted to be some mildly increased uptake in the mid esophageal region.
There was an 8 mm precarinal lymph node that was not FDG avid.
However, there was noted to be a mass in the left upper quadrant adjacent to the splenic flexure with an SUV of 17.5.
In addition there was left iliac node with an SUV of 33.4.
There was no evidence of FDG uptake in the lung or liver on this recent PET CT scan.
He does have symptoms of reflux but he has no dysphagia, odynophagia.
He feels that this is more likely related to loss of appetite given the recent diagnosis of esophageal cancer.
He has no other complaints at the current time and states that he feels to be otherwise in very good health.

Contrast passes freely through the esophagus into gastric pull-through with no evidence of obstruction or contrast extravasation at the upper anastomosis.
Degenerative changes are noted involving the cervical spine.
IMPRESSION: Status post esophagectomy and gastric pull-through without evidence upper anastomotic leak.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2120-11-29**] 8:54 AM Additional interval decrease in right apical pneumothorax is demonstrated.
The pleural surfaces are smooth and there is minimal amount of pleural effusion.
He had good pain control with an epidural and dilaudid PCA managed by the acute pain service.
He had continued in this fashion until POD#3, at which time both his epidural and foley catheters were removed as well as his nasogastric tube.
His chest tube drainage was consistently non-chylous, with a barium swallow demonstrating no evidence of a leak.
Throughout the entire post-operative course patient demonstrated an exceptionally positive attitude and truly participated in his own care.
He was evaluated by the thoracic surgery as being stable for discharge, requiring lovenox bridging therapy for coumadin anticoagulation with INR checks by his PCP/coumadin clinic.
