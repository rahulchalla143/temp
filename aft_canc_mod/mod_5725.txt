He was taken by EMS to LMH and CT head showed a large Left frontal cystic lesion and a small area of edema in the left cerebellum.

Left frontal and left cerebellar hemispheric enhancing lesions demonstrating marked slow diffusion.
In the setting of the findings on the recent chest CT, these intracranial lesions would be most suggestive of metastases from primary small cell carcinoma of the lung.
Additional round focus of slow diffusion and relatively [**Name2 (NI) 15403**] [**Name (NI) 90467**] in the medial left temporal lobe, without convincing enhancement.
Although a focal infarct, particularly embolic, is not entirely excluded, given the signal characteristics similar to the other lesions, above, this is concerning for a third metastatic deposit.
Relatively T1-hypointense regional bone marrow signal; while this may simply represent red marrow reconversion in response to anemia or systemic treatment, this finding should be correlated with clinical and laboratory data.
Large 4.4-cm left perihilar mass concerning for primary lung cancer.
Severe right hydronephrosis with cortical atrophy and a 9-mm calculus in the proximal right ureter.
This represents a chronic process, likely secondary to UPJ obstruction from a crossing vessel.
No evidence of osseous metastatic disease  CT head [**10-10**]:  expected postoperative changes, moderate pneumocephalus.
no hemorrhage  MRI Brain with and without contrast [**10-11**]: expected postoperative changes with good resection of left frontal lesion.
No acute infarcts.
Lower Extremity Dopplers [**10-13**]: No right- or left-sided lower extremity DVT.
Lower Extremity Dopplers [**10-20**]: No DVT of the bilateral lower extremity.

18 mm and 3 mm diameter calcifications located in the right abdomen may be related to renal and ureteral calculi considering presence of right ureteral calculus on CT of [**2138-10-7**].
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 76 year old Croele-speaking man who was found confused wandering around his Senior Center, and was taken to an OSH, where CT showed multiple brain lesions including a large left frontal lesion and a small area of edema in the left cerebellum.
He was started on Bactrim for a slightly positive UA.
MRI revealed a large Left frontal tumor and a small cerebellar mass.
There was some soft tissue edema noted above the left ear and an Ace wrap was applied for 1 hour.
The patient was brought to the SICU for recovery and a post operative Head Ct was performed which was consistent with expected post-operative change with some pneumocephalus.
On [**2138-10-11**], a MRI with and without constrast was performed which was consistent with expected post-op changes.
# Lung Mass: CT chest showing 4.4cm left peri-hilar mass concerning for primary lung cancer.
During his hospital stay he completed a 7 day course of Bactrim for WBCs in urine and altered mental status suspiscious for UTI.
# Hyponatremia: On [**10-14**] the patient's serum Na was 130 and so he was placed on a fluid restriction and started on salt tabs.
He remained afebrile and stable during his course on the floor.
Hyponatremia has been improving with fluid restriction.

You presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for treatment of metastatic lung cancer to your brain.
