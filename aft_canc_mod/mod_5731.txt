She has received 1 cycle of MiDAC for consolidation on [**2118-2-28**].
She reports feeling well, except for mild persistent fatigue.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGY HISTORY: - Panyctopenia noted on preop for excisional biopsy, CBC revealed  a white blood count of 2.2, hematocrit of 34.2, platelet count  of 116,000, and MCV of 101 at OSH.
- BM Bx at OSH on [**2117-12-7**] showed dyspoietic granulocytes and 13% myeloblasts.
There was no immunophenotypic evidence for lymphoproliferative disorder and the findings were most suggestive of a clonal myeloid neoplasm thought to be MDS with excess blasts.
- Referred to [**Hospital1 18**], repeat BM bx on [**1-13**] showed 15% blasts on  aspirate and translocation between chromosome 6 at band 6p23 and  chromosome 9 at band 9q34 - s/p Idarubicin 7+3 induction Day 1: [**2118-1-21**] Cycle end: [**2118-2-17**].
During her neutropenic period, she developed acute fevers with focal erythroderm on her L forearm and distal L>R leg.
Prior to the hospitalization, she had a L parotidectomy for what turned out to be parotiditis and sialadenitis with a large  retained duct stone.
Ultimately, it became clear she had no persistent infectious process in the parotid bed, but had evolving carbapenem and cephalosporin erythroderm.
Her course was further complicated by a fever curve that had regular Tmax in the 101 range, resolving while on vancomycin, aztreonam, clindamycin and micafungin, but  then recurred first low grade then becoming very hectic and high  grade to 104 without any focal findings.
-Epilepsy with a history of grand mal seizures.
She does not drink any alcohol due to her antiepileptic medications.
She has a daughter who was diagnosed with colon cancer at age 29, currently in remission.
She has another daughter age 31 with a pituitary tumor and she has a third daughter who is healthy.

Sinus rhythm.
EEG ([**4-20**]): IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of moderate diffuse background slowing and frequent generalized bursts of high amplitude slow waves.
These findings are indicative of a moderate diffuse encephalopathy which suggests widespread cerebral dysfunction but is etiologically non-specific.
There were no epileptiform features.
Non-specific inferior ST-T wave flattening.
INVESTIGATION OF TRANSFUSION RXN ([**2118-4-29**]): DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] experienced chills and urticaria after receiving an infusion of hematopoietic stem cells.
The laboratory work-up revealed no evidence of hemolysis.
Approximately 2% of infusions will be complicated by chills likely resulting from recipient anti-HLA antibodies reacting with donor white blood cells.
Additionally, recipient antibodies against plasma proteins present in the component may cause allergic type reactions characterized by urticaria.
INVESTIGATION OF TRANSFUSION RXN ([**2118-5-4**]): DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] experienced a urticarial reaction after transfusion of an apheresis platelet transfusion.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema or mass effect.
Highly symmetric confluent hypoattenuation in bihemispheric white matter, unusual for typical sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease, and more characteristic of intrathecal methotrexate or other treatment-effect, which should be correlated with more detailed clinical information.
INVESTIGATION OF TRANSFUSION RXN ([**2118-5-13**]): DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Ms. [**Known lastname **] developed an urticarial reaction after receiving a bag of apheresis platelets on [**2118-5-13**].
The presence of occasional urticarial transfusion reactions does not typically predict future severe reactions.
We recommend no changes in transfusion practices in this patient at this time.
No acute intracranial process.
Stable periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities may be related to intrathecal methotrexate or other treatment effect and less likely the sequela of chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
Mild global atrophy.
Diffuse ground-glass opacities within the entire right lung.
Given that the patient is status post bone marrow transplant prior to engrafting, bacterial, viral, and fungal etiologies should all be considered including infections such as toxoplasmosis or CMV.
Bilateral trace pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Echo ([**5-17**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2118-3-29**], no change.
renal u/s ([**5-17**]): IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis bilaterally.
The severity and extent of the pre-existing extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities is constant.
Also constant is the absence of pleural effusions, the moderate cardiomegaly and the position of the right internal jugular vein catheter.
When compared to the most recent prior study, there has been slight interval improvement in the bilateral airspace process suggestive of moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.
However, there is still a substantial residual pulmonary edema present on the current examination.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
No acute intracranial process.
Stable periventricular and subcortical white matter low-attenuating regions may be related to treatment effect or the sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Mild age-related involutional changes.
EEG ([**5-22**]): IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of a diffuse encephalopathy manifest by a mild to moderate background slowing.
Superimposed upon this is focal slowing in the left central temporal region with superimposed admixed paroxysmal epileptiform transients in the same region.
No seizures were identified.
These may represent pulmonary edema; however, superimposed infection is not entirely excluded.
A small left-sided pleural effusion is also seen.
UENI ([**5-22**]): IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the right upper extremity.
EEG ([**5-23**]): IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of disorganized theta and delta background indicative of mild to moderate diffuse encephalopathy.
In addition, there is focal slowing in the left frontocentral region with superimposed epileptiform discharges.
There were no electrographic seizures.
Compared to the prior day's recording, there were no significant changes.
CSF ([**5-23**]): 	Cerebrospinal fluid:  	NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
EEG ([**5-24**]): MPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of disorganized theta and delta background indicative of mild to moderate diffuse encephalopathy.
In addition, there is focal slowing in the left frontocentral region with superimposed epileptiform discharges.
There were no electrographic seizures.
Compared to the prior day's recording, there were no significant changes.
No evidence of obstruction.
CT Chest non-con ([**5-27**]): IMPRESSION: Increased pulmonary ground-glass opacities and interstitial abnormality.
New pleural and increased pericardial effusions.
Appearance is most compatible with viral infection, such as CMV, or Pneumocystis.
Graft versus host disease could also have this appearance, but should also produce extrathoracic manifestations.
Red blood cells are normochromic and normocytic with slight anisopoikilocytosis including rare teardrop microcytes and schistocytes seen.
Aspirate Smear: The aspirate material is suboptimal for evaluation due to paucity of spicules and hemodilution.
Erythroid precursors are relatively, proportionately decreased in number and exhibit dyspoietic maturation; forms with irregular nuclear contours are seen.
Myeloid precursors appear relatively increased in number.
Abnormal nuclear lobation and hypogranular forms are seen.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides:  The core biopsy material is suboptimal for evaluation, severely limited by aspiration and crush artifact.
It consists of a 0.8 cm core, trabecular marrow with a cellularity of 5%.
Minimal hematopoietic tissue is seen in one space.
No excess of blasts.
Erythroid precursors are decreased in number and exhibit mildly dyspoietic maturation.
Myeloid precursors are decreased in number with complete maturation to neutrophilic stage with left shifted maturation with dyspoietic maturation.
SKIN BIOPSY [**2118-6-2**]: Skin, left inferior abdomen, biopsy (A-B):  Mild superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, with occasional eosinophils, see note.
No acute intracranial abnormality.
No pathologic focus of enhancement.
Extensive FLAIR-signal abnormality in bihemispheric subcortical and periventricular, as well as central pontine white matter.
Though this likely represents sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease, a contribution of treatment effect is a consideration, and should be closely correlated with detailed history (e.g.
Is there any history of intrathecal methotrexate or other chemotherapeutic [**Doctor Last Name 360**]?).
NCHCT [**2118-6-9**]: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or  infarction.
Periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities are suggestive of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
There is no fracture.
Chest CT [**2118-6-17**]: There is been marked improvement in the interstitial opacities in the lungs with mild residual or recurrent disease seen in the right lower lobe.
Bilateral pleural effusions have resolved.
A small unchanged cyst is seen in the left upper lobe.
Normal three vessel branching aortic arch is seen with mild atherosclerotic calcification.
The heart appears normal with mitral and aortic valvular calcifications and perhaps mild calcification of the left main coronary artery.
Small pericardial effusion is unchanged or minimally more prominent than the previous examination.
No pathologically enlarged axillary, supraclavicular, mediastinal or hilar nodes are seen.
Calcification is seen at the celiac and SMA origins [**2118-6-20**] Radiology MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST IMPRESSION: 1.
No evidence of acute infarct or hemorrhage.
Stable bilateral subcortical and periventricular T2/FLAIR hyperintensities likely representing microangiopathic ischemic changes versus post-treatment changes.
No evidence of PTLD on this non-contrast CT of the abdomen.
Diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.
Nonspecific peribronchovascular ground-glass opacity in the right lower lobe.
[**2118-6-21**] Neurophysiology EEG .
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of one electrographic seizure in the left temporal region with spread to the left parasagittal area lasting 48 seconds.
In addition, there are frequent left temporal epileptiform discharges and intermittent prominent slowing in this region.
These findings are indicative of an epileptogenic focus with underlying subcortical dysfunction in the left temporal lobe.
Furthermore, the posterior dominant rhythm was poorly sustained with further bursts of bifrontal intermittent rhythmic delta (FIRDA) slowing indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
These findings are suggestive of a potentially epileptogenic focus in the left temporal region with underlying subcortical dysfunction.
In addition, the posterior dominant rhythm was not well-sustained and there were frequent bursts of bifrontal intermittent rhythmic delta (FIRDA) slowing indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
Potential causes include, but are not limited to, medication effect or metabolic, toxic, and infectious disturbances.
There are no electrographic seizures.
Compared to prior day's recording, this study shows improvement due to less frequent left temporal epileptiform discharges and the absence of electrographic seizures.
[**2118-6-23**] Neurophysiology EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of intermittent focal slowing and rare epileptiform discharges in the left temporal region.
These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in the left temporal region with underlying subcortical dysfunction.
There is also a poorly sustained alpha rhythm, excess diffuse admixed theta and delta activity and rare bursts of frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity.
These findings are indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is etiologically non-specific.
There are no electrographic seizures.
Compared to the prior day's recording, there is less frequent and less prominent left temporal slowing and epileptiform discharges have also decreased in frequency.

Admission complicated by bacteremia, hyponatremia/SIADH, mild mucositis, CMV pneumonitis and altered mental status.
She has received 1 cycle of MiDAC for consolidation on [**2118-2-28**].
She had a repeat bone marrow biopsy on [**2118-6-29**], which preliminarily showed hypoplastic marrow consistent w/ suppression from medication (suspected to be due to valgancyclovir, see below).
# Bacteremia: Patient found to have staph epidermitis bacteremia [**2-24**] line infection, complicated by fevers to 103 and severe rigors.
Was in ICU for 5 days for respiratory distress (likely caused by CMV pneumonitis and pulmonary edema).
Of note, pt has many allergies, most notably antibiotic allergies that have caused severe and painful body rashes.
Per ID, will continue meropenem through Monday, [**5-30**], as low likelihood infection in lung is a bacterial cause.
Follow-up CT scan done [**5-27**] shows worsening of pulm interstitial and ground glass, but patient clinically much better.
Patient has had no fevers since [**5-25**].
Patient also had pulmonary edema.
# CMV PNEUMONITIS:  patient was admitted to the ICU on [**5-20**] in the setting of acute respiratory distress as above.
At this time a CMV viral load returned elevated at 9000.
She continued to do well clinically, but developed acute renal insufficency with a gradual rise in her creatinine from 1.0 to 2.2 over the 2 weeks she recieved foscarnate.
A CMV resistance genotype was sent and was negative for any resistant mutations.
# Hyponatremia.
While undergoing conditioning for transplant, the patient became hyponatremic to 129.
The patient was started on a 1L fluid restriction, but continue to have persistent hyponatremia.
While anti-epileptics changed in ICU, pt was able to keep Na of low 130s w/ no need for hypertonic saline or salt tabs, only fluid restriction.
Pt's hyponatremia was resolved and sodium was stable by discharge at ~135, although pt continued to have mild diuresis.
# Back pain: Patient with low midline back pain that began when getting onto a CT scanner table.
Back pain likely mechanical secondary to strain.
Pain improved with lidocaine patch.
# Esophagitis:  While neutropenic, the patient experienced mild symptoms of mucositis.
Breakthrough symptoms were controlled on oxycodone 5 mg PO and resolved prior to discharge.
# Seizures : The patient's home regimen was: LeVETiracetam 500 mg [**Hospital1 **], Clonazepam 0.5 mg TID:PRN, Oxcarbazepine 900 mg PO BID.
Patient had 48hrs EEG w/out definitive seizures, but seizure-like activity while in the ICU.
CT head on [**5-21**] had no acute intracranial changes.
Patient also had altered mental status in the ICU, unclear whether etiology was seizures vs. ICU delirium.
Begining the week of [**6-16**] the patient was again noted to be slightly lethargic and confused.
Neurology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and agreed with decreasing her dose of keppra in the setting of her renal insufficency this change was made on [**6-18**].
Pt was discharged on levetiracetam 750mg po bid and Lacosamide 150 mg po bid for seizure prophylaxis.
She should see neurology for possible uptitration of her medications as an outpatient since her latest EEG showed some minor epileptiform activity, although she is currently asymptomatic.
# acute renal insufficiency:  Patient initially developed acute renal insufficency on [**5-5**] in the setting of gancyclovir administration and her acute clinical deterioration related to CMV infection.
On [**6-1**] her creatinine was again noted to be elevated in the setting of foscarnate administration for refractory CMV infection as described above.
Urine only had a few muddy brown casts, not really consistent with ATN or AIN.
Renal service is also unclear on etiology of [**Name (NI) 1094**] continued diuresis or hyponatremia (see above).
Also felt that hypovolemia may be contributing and mild response with fluids.
A venous free calcium was sent and returned elevated at 1.5 confirming hypercalcemia.
Initially her fluids were increased to promote diuresis without effect.
PTH was inappropriately elevated at 29, but not felt to be the primary driving mechanism of her hypercalcemia.
Endocrinology was consulted and felt that her elevated calcium and phosphate was the result of primary hyperparathyroidism combined with secondary causes including imobility.
Various efforts to control her hypercalceima were trialed including diuresis with lasix, calcitonin, phosphate binders and promindronate none of which substantially reversed her hypercalcemia which was felt to be driving her symptoms of constipation, abdominal pain and lethargy.
Endocrine service recommended outpatient MIBI parathyroid scan for adenoma.
# hypertension: previously on lisinopril, held due to [**Doctor First Name 48**].
She occasionally suffers from "buckling" of her knees and is currently a high fall risk.
# increased urinary frequency: Pt had increased urinary frequency for the last 2 days of her admission, no fevers.
UA on [**2118-7-5**] showed WBC 85, RBC 33, no bacteria.
5. heparin (porcine) 5,000 unit/mL Solution Sig: One (1) Injection three times a day: Pt may refuse if ambulating.
14. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day): hold for loose stool.
15. polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram Powder in Packet Sig: One (1) Powder in Packet PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: -Myelodysplastic syndrome, with allogenic matched unrelated donor stem cell transplant -epilepsy -acute renal insufficiency -CMV pneumonitis / pneumonia -hypercalcemia (likely primary hyperparathyroidism) -hyponatremia (resolved)  Secondary: -hypertension -anxiety   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You also were treated with antibiotics for an infection with your bloodstream and a severe viral infection of your lungs.
