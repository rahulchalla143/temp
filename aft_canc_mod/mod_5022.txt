Admission Date:  [**2179-9-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-9-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2106-3-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Allergies/ADRs on File  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5810**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Chest tube placement and removal Endotracheal Intubation ([**9-21**]) and extubation ([**9-23**]) PICC placement   History of Present Illness: 73yo male w/ stage IIIB squamous cell lung cancer, s/p recent chemo and radiation, coming from a [**Hospital1 1501**] with dyspnea since yesterday.
No reported fevers, but also developed lower extremity edema.
EMS found him with shortness of breath, with oxygen saturations in low 80s, put on non-rebreather, then CPAP for transfer.
No history of CHF.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted from [**9-13**] to [**2179-9-17**] to [**Hospital 3278**] medical center with dysphagia and diagnosed with radiation esophagitis.
Patient was found to have a right-sided pneumothorax, so a right-sided chest tube was placed, which drained 300cc of foul-smelling purulent fluid after a large gush of air.
Repeat CXR showed incomplete expansion of the right lung.
Labs notable for anemia of 33.8, lactate 3.3, WBC 7.3 with 33% bands.
To get CT scan, and on return to the ED had worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress and was intubated.
Past Medical History: - Stage IIIB squamous cell cancer diagnosed [**6-/2179**] with large right lower lobe [**Location (un) 21851**] extending into the subcarina.
Right supraclavicular and R paratracheal lymphadenopathy.
Lesions in the stomach and liver suspicious for mets being worked up.
- hypertension - hyperlipidemia  Social History: - Tobacco: 12 pack year smoking history, has quit - Alcohol: none - Illicits: none   Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: General: Intubated, sedated.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, PERRL Neck: JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Bilateral R>L coarse breath sounds.
CV: Tachy, regular, no audible murmurs Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended GU: foley in place Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema  DISCHARGE EXAM: VS: RR 20 (16-22), pain 0/10 General: NAD, though restless.
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds in the R lung field, coarse breath sounds throughout the left lung field GU: no foley Ext: cool, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis, edema Otherwise physical exam upon discharge is unchanged from admission.
NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
STUDIES: [**2179-9-21**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia with non-specific ST-T wave changes in the lateral precordial leads.
Large right-sided pneumothorax with deviation of mediastinal structures to the left concerning for tension.
Hazy density in the left mid and lower lung zones which may represent infectious process.
Per clinical concern for empyema, there is minimal layering fluid within the right hemithorax without organization or enhancing walls to suggest underlying empyema.
There are dense consolidations, worse in the right lower lobe with central areas of hypoattenuation and air which are most compatible with necrotizing pneumonia.
Multifocal pneumonia is suspected with extensive patchy opacities also noted in the right upper, left upper and left lower lobes.
Only the consolidation of the right lower lobe demonstrates areas of necrosis.
Persistent right pneumothorax with indwelling chest tube.
No significant mediastinal shift is seen to suggest recurrence of tension physiology.
This is of indeterminate etiology or chronicity.
This could be related to underlying infection.
Given the lack of parietal pleural thickening or other abnormality, malignancy is felt less likely but is not excluded.
[**2179-9-24**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Diffuse abnormality in the right lung continues to clear, particularly following removal of the right pleural tube suggesting that most of this abnormality was due to combination of edema and hemorrhage rather than pneumonia.
Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion remains.
There is no pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 73M with stage IIIB squamous cell lung cancer, s/p chemo and palliative radiation, coming from a [**Hospital1 1501**] with SOB, found to have MSSA multifocal pneumonia, empyema, and pneumothorax, s/p chest tube placement and now removal.
Pt had no further lab draws.
He was intubated for respiratory distress on admission, extubated on [**2179-9-23**].
# Esophagitis: Secondary to recent radiation.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Healthcare Center - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Pneumothorax Necrotizing multifocal pneumonia Empyema  Secondary Diagnosis: Stage IIIB squamous cell lung cancer  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted with shortness of breath, but then then found to have a small hole in your lung, pneumonia, and empyema (an infection in the fluid that surrounds your lungs).
The pneumonia and empyema were treated with antibiotics.
Therefore, any intervention that would cause discomfort was held or discontinued.
Albuterol - for difficulty breathing 2.
Acetaminophen - for pain and fever 3.
Lorazepam - for anxiety or distress 6.
Morphine elixir - for pain  Please STOP taking: 1.
