However the patient has refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation to acute myelogenous leukemia (last chemotherapy was last week, diagnosed in [**Month (only) 596**]), PLT 31, and plavix and aspirin was stopped under the direction of her oncologist and cardiologist.
Has been having intermittent chest pain since this AM, [**9-3**] in intensity, was given 2 slnitro's, 1mg Morphine x's 2, dilaudid w/relief of the pain.
This AM EKG showed ST elevation in inferior leads.
On route to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was experiencing nausea and vomiting.
On arrival to the floor, EKG showed juncional rhythm at 50, with 1-3mm ST elevation in II, III, avF with reciprocal changes in anterior leads.
No aspirin or heparin given due to pt's low platelets.
Before placing the pacer, she was tried on Dopamine which did result in a higher HR and increased UOP but caused 10/10 chest pain.
HTN 2.
Hypercholesterolemia 3.
Partial hysterectomy.
Renital disease (detached retina which led to workup of blood problems) 7.
Family History: CAD: brother died of MI in 60's, sister died 59y/o heart dz, son  MI at 49y/o.
Physical Exam: VS: BP 100/50  HR 50  RR 16 98% 2L Gen: having chest pain, resting in bed, partly relieved by morphine HEENT: R pupil minimally reactive, L pupil reacts.
OP clear Neck: + JVD, no LAD Lungs: CLAB Heart: bradycardic, S1S2, no murmur, rub, gallop Abd: +BS, soft, ND/NT Extrem: no edema  Pertinent Results: OSH Labs: Wbc 4.4 Hgb 9.8 Hct 29.9 (transfused last week at [**Location (un) **]) Plt 31; Na 139; K+ 4.5; CL 109; CO2 26; BUN 24; creat 1.1; Trop 3.58 (up from 1.54) .
EKG: Junctional rhythm at 50, ST elevation in II, III, aVF, with reciprocal changes in anterior leads  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 76 F with MDS in transformation to AML, thrombocytopenia who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with inferior STEMI.
# Cardiac: a) CAD/Inferior STEMI: The patient was not a candidate for reperfusion as she has hematologic abnormalities (low platelets) and could not have long term anti-platelet therapy with aspirin or plavix.
She also could not get heparin due to bleeding risk.
An ace-inhibitor was not given initially because of acute renal failure, but the was added once the ARF resolved.
b) Rhythm: Initially, patient had a junctional rhythm that was stable.
However, she later experienced recurrent asystolic pauses up to 6 seconds.
The patient was found to only intermittently require her pacer and was in normal sinus rhythm.
c) Pump: EF of 50% with inferior hypokinesis and RV dysfunction on echo on [**8-8**].
Chemotherapy was held while the patient was treated for an acute MI.
# Acute Renal Failure: Thought to be due to ATN as a result of poor perfusion.
The patient had little to no urine output after first being admitted, but during her hospitalization, her creatinine trended down and her urinary ouput increased.
Patient's electrolytes were monitored and corrected without incident.
#Renal cysts: Patient was found to have a new nodular component to renal cysts on u/s with recommendation to have an MRI to further evaluate these cysts.
Furosemide 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO qd PRN as needed for swollen feet.
Disp:*30 Tablet Sustained Release 24HR(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home with Service  Discharge Diagnosis: Inferior STEMI Junctional Rhythm Bradycardia AML Neutropenia   Discharge Condition: Heart rate in the 60-70's sinus rhythm, afebrile, appropriate followup arranged.
Call your doctor or go to the ER for any of the following: chest pain, shortness of breath, fever >100.4, chills or any other concerning symptoms.
