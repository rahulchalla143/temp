The aortic arch is mildly dilated.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
Left lower extremity ultrasound [**2164-6-18**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
There is minimal amount of pericardial effusion, grossly unchanged since the prior study.
Small but new bilateral pleural effusion is noted.
Within the axilla, there are multiple minimally enlarged lymph nodes.
There are no bone lesions worrisome for infection or neoplasm.
Right upper lobe consolidation seen on the prior CT and radiographs has significantly progressed since the prior study, currently involving the apical posterior aspect of the right upper lobe as well as superior aspect of right lower lobe.
There is lucency within the lateral aspect of the consolidation in the right upper lobe, most likely representing still aerated lung and unlikely to represent cavitation although should be closely monitored.
The left lung is clear except for basal opacities that in part might represent atelectasis and unlikely to represent infectious process.
The progression of the consolidation has been also demonstrated on the chest radiograph when compared to [**2164-7-8**], thus further followup of the abnormality can be obtained with chest radiographs.
The other options would be invasive aspergillosis (less likely) as well as massive aspiration (unlikely).
TTE [**2164-7-13**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Continued interval worsening of multifocal pulmonary consolidations now involving most of the right upper lobe and majority of the lower lobe basal segments bilaterally.
Small bilateral pleural effusions have also increased.
No significant pathology noted within the abdomen and pelvis other than slight interval increase of soft tissue anasarca and mild amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
There are no findings of ileus or obstruction.
Liver and Gallbladder US [**2164-7-22**] IMPRESSION: Limited right upper quadrant ultrasound demonstrates a normal gallbladder without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
CT Chest [**2164-7-30**] As compared to the prior CT torso from [**2164-7-19**], there is significant interval improvement in the right upper lobe consolidation and left lower lobe consolidation with improved aeration of both lobes.
The consolidation which are currently present are still substantial and involve the posterior segment of right upper lobe as well as apical and part of the basal segments of right lower lobe.
In the left lung, there is interval resolution of left lower lobe consolidation with only minimal residual present.
There are multiple mediastinal lymph nodes, but none of them pathologically enlarged.
Extensive coronary calcifications are present, unchanged.
There is small amount of pericardial effusion, minimally increased since the prior study.
There is evidence of anemia.
Airways are patent to the level of subsegmental bronchi bilaterally.
Right lung pulmonary nodules are noted in the previously consolidated area of the lungs, most likely representing residua of prior infection, with similar appearance in the left lower lobe and might be reevaluated in three months for documentation of resolution.
No evidence of interstitial abnormality is present.
======================= MICRO: BCx: all sterile UCx: all sterile Cryptococcal antigen: negative BAL ([**2164-7-10**]): neg Gram stain, commensal respiratory Cx, neg for legionella/KOH prep/PCP/fungus/nocardia/AFB/mycobacteria/CMV BAL ([**2164-7-14**]): Gram stain +leukocyte, no microorganism; neg respiratory Cx, neg for legionella/KOH prep/PCP/fungus/nocardia/AFB/mycobacteria/CMV MRSA screen negative Respiratory viral Cx ([**2164-7-20**]): negative C diff toxin ([**2164-7-25**]): negative   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 88668**] is a 55yo male with no significant past medical history who presented with cellulitis and elevated WBC with high percentage of blasts and was diagnosed with AML-M2 carrying a (8:21) translocation.
# AML: Patient presented for evaluation of cellulitis and was found to have WBC 22 with 85% blasts.
He underwent bone marrow biopsy [**6-27**] which showed new acute leukemia, AML-M2 with cytogenetics carrying translocations at ETO at 8q21 which is considered a to be a good prognostic indicator.
Baseline ECHO showed mild MR and was otherwise unremarkable.
Day 14 bone marrow biopsy was hypocellular consistent with ablated marrow.
His recovery bone marrow biopsy done on day 37 also showed complete remission.
He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3759**] for consolidation chemotherapy.
# Pneumonia: Patient developed productive cough [**7-8**] in the setting of neutropenic fever, a CT chest showed a right upper lobe round infiltrate with surrounding ground glass opacities (halo sign).
Concern for invasive aspergilosis was raised, ID was consulted and he was started on voriconazole (in addition to vancomycin and cefepime).
He underwent broncheoalveolar lavage which revealed purulent material in the right upper lobe, cultures were taken which was unrevealing.
He developed hypoxia and tachypenia and repeat CT showed progression of the previously seen right upper lobe infiltrate.
Given tenuous respiratory status, he was transferred to the ICU for close monitoring in the context of tachycardia and hypotension.
Repeat imaging showed worsening of his right upper lobe pneumonia, with opacities extending throughout the right hemithorax.
As he failed to improve with broad spectrum antibiotics and fungal coverage, and as BAL failed to reveal a microbial pathogen on culture, a lung biopsy was initially pursued, though eventually postponed due to elevated PEEP and for fear of inciting pneumothorax in a tenuous patient.
BAL was repeated on [**2164-7-14**] and [**2164-7-20**], which again failed to show any pathogenic culprit.
He received a single dose of steroids on [**7-22**] in treatment of questionable BOOP, though this was discontinued in discussion with the BMT team who felt that infection was still most likely.
He is being covered with posaconazole at the time of discharge, and will continue this medication until end of his consolidation chemotherapy.
The repeat Chest CT on [**2164-7-30**] showed significant improvement of pneumonia, but still significant consolidation of R lung and pulmonary nodules, likely infectious.
C. diff was also suspected given his ileus and rapid rise in WBC; therefore, he was started on IV flagyl and vancomycin enema, although he has been unable to tolerate vancomycin enemea.
BMT service believes taht his leukocytosis and fever could be partly from robust return of his bone marrow s/p 7+3.
After transfer back to the BMT service and with improvement of his pneumonia, he remained afebrile on the floor until discharge.
# Atrial fibrillation/flutter: Patient had new onset of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the setting of sepsis from the above noted pulmonary infection.
He was placed on TID PO lopressor though again reverted to a fast atrial flutter at 150bpm during his second ICU night with hypotension to 80s systolic.
He received bolus diltiazem and then diltiazem gtt with levophed support, and he eventually reverted to sinus rhythm.
He began amiodarone loading to prevent further arrhythmia.
He received IV amiodarone until [**2164-7-20**] because of concern for ileus, resumed po as bowel sounds returned, but ultimately stopped on [**7-21**] as he was persistently in sinus rhythm and with increasing alkaline phosphatase, thought [**3-7**] medications.
# Hypotension:  He had hypotension to 80s systolic while in the MICU, which was initially fluid responsive.
These pressures had occurred with his tachycardia and nodal blockade, and he was eventually placed on pressors as we struggled to control his HR.
He remained hypotensive on high doses of fentanyl/midazolam to control agitation.
While likely septic, his pressure improved with sedation weaning, suggesting a substantial iatrogenic source.
# Cellulitis: Patient was presented with a left lower leg swelling and erythemia.
Ultrasound was negative for DVT.
He was diagnosed with cellulitis and treated with Vancomycin and Cefepime for an extended course given neutropenia.
He completed a 24 day course of antibiotics and his cellulitis resolved.
# Rash: patient developed an erythematous, maculopapular non puritic rash over the extensor surface of his forearms bilatearlly.
At the time, he had been treated with cefepime for 14 days and drug rash was considered possible.
The rash resolved over time.
# Ileus.
- off vancomycin enema as above - on mostly IV formulation for meds at this time - continue bisacodyl pr prn - continue TF, check residual  Medications on Admission: Trazodone Aspirin 81mg Terazosin Alprazolam   Discharge Medications: 1. trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
We also treated cellulitis with antibiotics and this improved greatly.
You developed neutropenia (low white cell counts) with chemotherapy and had fevers, for which you received antibiotics and had CT scan of your chest.
You also developed irregular, rapid heartbeat which were treated with medications, and your heartbeats are now normal.
Because you had difficulty breathing with your pneumonia, you had to be intubated and have help with breathing for a while.
