Pertinent Results: [**2187-3-4**] CXR: The lungs appear clear bilaterally, demonstrating no evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
No evidence for obstruction.
Mild focal increased tracer uptake outlining the right humeral prosthesis has decreased in intensity compared with the prior study and likely reflects sequelae of healing.
Interval development of intense tracer uptake in the sternum is suspicious for metastatic disease.
A linear focus of tracer uptake in the sacrum is suspicious for a sacral insufficiency fracture.
There is a nodule in the right upper lobe on the SPECT images.
