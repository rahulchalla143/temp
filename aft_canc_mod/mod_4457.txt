Brief Hospital Course: 62 y/o M with history of pancreatic cancer s/p whipple currently on chemotherapy with gemcitabine with port in place, presenting with fevers and hypotension.
Active issues: # MRSA Bacteremia: Pt transferred from OSH to [**Hospital1 18**] given persistent hypotension and elevated lactate despite 4L IV fluids.
He had evident dehiscence of his left chest port, with this compromise of the skin barrier the suspected source for an infection.
TTE and TEE showed no signs of endocarditis.
# Acute kidney injury: Cr elevated to 1.9 on admission from baseline of 1.0, improved somewhat with hydration but did not return to baseline (1.4-1.5 range).
# Diabetes: Patient with hyperglycemia on admission, but no anion gap.
# Pancreatic adenocarcinoma: poorly differentiated T3N1MX pancreatic adenocarcinoma s/p Whipple resection [**2113-8-21**], recently treated with gemcitabine.
# Hypertension: home lisinopril held on admission due to hypotension, acute kidney injury.
Thrombocytopenia noted is suspected to be a side effect of gemcitabine and should continue to be trended.
