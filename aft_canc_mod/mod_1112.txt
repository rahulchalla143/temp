No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
There is no overt pulmonary edema.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
CT Head ([**2140-8-27**]) - IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Calcified inferofrontal meningioma is stable, as is associated vasogenic edema and mass effect compared to [**2140-6-20**].
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 18915**] is an 84yo F with a history of olfactory groove meningioma that presents with mental status changes in the context of hyperglycemia and hypernatremia.
# Hyperglycemia:  The patient presented with a glucose of over 600 and profound mental status changes.
There were no ketones in the urine concerning for DKA.
She has no established history of diabetes, but has been maintained on high dose dexamethasone to control her cerebral edema from the known meningioma, so she is effectively diabetic.
She developed HONK in the setting of steroid-induced hyperglycemia and likely restricted access to water given her dementia.
She was admitted to the ICU and was aggressively rehydrated for hypernatremia, and was started on an insulin drip with subsequent resolution of her hyperglycemia within 24 hours.
No acute triggers for her hyperglycemia were noted- her CXR, blood and urine cultures were negative on admission.
While tapering her steroids was initially considered, after speaking to her neurologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**], it was decided to continue her decadron at her previous dose of 4mg [**Hospital1 **], as she has significant cerebral edema related to the meningioma that would likely worsen in the event of a taper and lead to further neurologic deficit.
# Hypernatremia - Her corrected sodium 167 on admission.
Patient was volume resucitated, and that achieved better control of her sodium.
# Altered mental status:  The patient suffered from a likely acute delirium on top of a chronic dementia.
She experienced a very rapid decline in function since [**Month (only) 404**], becoming increasingly reliant on her children for her ADLs and IADLs.
Elevated liver enzyme tests:  She had an uptrending transaminases, LDH, and AP.
She remained asymptomatic without myositis or abdominal pain.
# Multifocal atrial rhythm - is frequently a process secondary to illness, hyperglycemia, and electrolyte abn.
EKG was reassuring with no acute ST segment changes that would suggest an ischemic process.
# Meningioma - Her meningioma was described as stable on recent CT scan.
# Acute renal failure - She presented with likely prerenal failure given hypovolemic state.
# Hypertension - Her antihypertensives were held in the ICU as her pressures remained low in the 90s.
# Hypothyroidism -levothyroxine was continued.
# Hyperlipidemia - her lipitor was held due to elevated LFTs as described above.
Benzonatate 200 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO three times a day as needed for cough.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 Puffs Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for sob/wheeze.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 18915**],  You were admitted to the hospital due to confusion and a very high blood sugar and sodium level.
