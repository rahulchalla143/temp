Possible old septal myocardial infarction.
Left anterior fascicular block.
CT Head [**2146-9-7**]: right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with mild mass effect and leftward shift of midline structures.
No new areas of hemorrhage noted.
No obvious heterogeneous nodular component of intermediate signal intensity is noted within this location to suggest an obvious tumor.
Diminutive right vertbral artery in the head and c spine- can be congenital; correlate with MRA when appropriate.
Diffuse mucosal thickening with fluid in the mastoid air cells, small amount of fluid in the sphenoid sinus and mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells as described above.
CT Head [**2146-9-8**]: Unchanged right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage adjacent to the capsuloganglionic region.
No new areas of hemorrhage or edema.
This hemorrhage is most consistent with a hypertensive etiology; however, an underlying mass or vascular malformation cannot be excluded.
CT L-Spine: No fracture involving the lumbar spine.
Degenerative change in the low lumbar spine worst at L4-5, where chronic grade 1 anterolisthesis, disc bulge, and facet arthropathy cause moderate canal stenosis, though intrathecal detail is poorly assessed by CT. Pl.
see subsequent MRI which shows moderate - severe canal stenosis, crowding of the roots of cauda and impingement on L4 and L5 nerves on both sides.
Nodule at splenic hilum- likely splenule; left lumbar paraspinal ovoid lesion- pl.
has additional h/o malignant spindle cell neoplasm)  CT T Spine: No fracture or traumatic malalignment involving the thoracic spine.
Mild multilevel degenerative change, without severe canal narrowing.
Numerous pulmonary nodules, the largest being a 3.1 cm mass in the left lower lobe, compatible with patient's known metastatic disease.
MRT/L Spine: L4/5: Grade 1 anterolisthesis with pars defects; bil facet joints resulting in moderate-severe canal and foraminal stenosis and crowding of cauda; impingement on L4 and l5 nerves.
T spine: no disc herniation or cord compression.
Areas of altered signal intensity in the posterior thecal sac- likely pulsation artifacts; however, incompletley assessed  MRI C Spine: Multilevel, multifactorial degenerative changes, with broad-based disc osteophyte complexes indenting the ventral thecal sac and the ventral surface of the cord at C5-6 and C6-7 levels, with foraminal narrowing as described above.
Subtle linear hyperintense focus, in the C2 body relates to marrow edema.
However, the significance of this finding is uncertain as there is no definite fracture on the prior CT C-spine study.
No obvious focus of marrow edema to suggest injury.
Multilevel, multifactorial degenerative changes in the thoracic and the lumbar spine, most prominent at L4-L5 level with mild anterolisthesis, bilateral facet degenerative changes, resulting in moderate-to-severe canal stenosis and moderate-to-severe foraminal narrowing, with impingement on the L4 and L5 nerves.
An ovoid lesion noted in the left paraspinous muscles at L2-L3 level measuring approximately 1.2 x 2.3 cm.
Areas of altered signal intensity in the posterior thecal space in the T-spine may relate to pulsation artifacts.
She remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable throughout her ICU stay.
In our hands on Day 1, she remained intubated and sedated so as to achieve formal MR imaging of her brain and C-spine so as to rule out soft tissue injury of the cervical spine.
A follow up NCHCT showed no evidence of enlarging bleed, and there was no midline shift.
Her physical examination did show some left sided weakness that has remained, but improved throughout her hospitalization.
Her brain MRI showed changes consistent with her known IPH on the right basal ganglia, no obvious evidence of metastatic lesion was noted, although this is difficult to tell in the acute period.
While here, we continued her chronic prednisone therapy.
