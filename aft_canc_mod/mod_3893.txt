Dilated common hepatic duct with smooth tapering to the pancreatic head.
No choledocholithiasis present.
The above descrived findings may be secondary to sphincter dysfunction or ampullary stenosis.
There is no mass in the region of the distal CBD or pancreatic head.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Left adrenal nodule which is not well characterized on the current exam.
Given the spiculated right lung mass, an evaluation with a dynamic CT is recommended to exclude metastatic disease involving the adrenal gland.
[**2104-1-11**] ECHO: Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include septal akinesis/hypokinesis, apical akinesis, mid to distal anterior and anterolateral hypokinesis and inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis/akinesis.
No definte left ventricular thrombus identified but cannot exclude.
The right ventricle is dilated Right ventricular systolic function is probably preserved(however intrinsic function may be depressed given severity of tricuspid regurgitation).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**2-11**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Cardiology was consulted and felt that she experienced a troponin leak [**3-14**] demand ischemia.
She was not having an acute coronary syndrome.
A GI consult was obtained for a possible ERCP after an MRCP revealed cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Since there was no evidence of cholecystitis or cholangitis, there was no indication for any surgical intervention either.
On the floor Ms. [**Known lastname 23333**] began the receipt of a 7 day regimen of Levo and Flagyl for possible cholecystitis as per surgery rec.
Otherwise, the pt was pain free and stable.
The pt was placed back on her most of her home medications except select blood pressure medications because of SBP in the low 100's.
The pt received 1U PRBC's the day of discharge for a slowly decreasing hematocrit secondary to her myelodysplastic disease.
She also has apparently had stents and multiple ?
myocardial infarctions.
Pt is pancytopenic with MDS, but is pain free, in good spirits, and has stable vitals   Discharge Instructions: You were were admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain, fever and elevated liver enzymes suggestive of an infection of your gallbladder.
You had an MRCP scan which showed that you do not have a blockage or infection of your gallbladder, but that you do have gall stones.
Your pain improved and your liver enzymes are markedly decreasing without any invasive intervention.
Please call your doctor or return to the ER for any of the following: -Unbearable abdominal pain, fever/shakes/chills, inability to eat, inability to urinate, extreme fatigue or weakness or any other worsening of your condition  Followup Instructions: 1) Please follow up with your Doctor, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] within 2 weeks.
