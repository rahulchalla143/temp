- No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
- No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
- Cessile mass on left side of interatrial septum measuring 0.9cm at base and 0.6cm height - Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
- The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
- Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
- Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
- LV Function remains perserved - Small PFO found on lower aspect of interatrial septum - Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
- Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
DIAGNOSIS:  Left atrial mass:  Consistent with atrial myxoma with fresh hemorrhage and focal associated fibrosis of subjacent atrial wall.
It consists of a fragment of white fibrous tissue overall measuring 2.0 x 2.0 x 0.3 cm.
Emulating from the center of the tissue is a red raised fragment of gelatinous tissue measuring 1.0 x 0.6 cm raised 1.0 cm above the surface of the specimen.
It was felt the risk of hemorrhagic conversion  of his left parietal cortical infarct was relatively low risk, and he was cleared for surgery.
