Admission Date:  [**2110-8-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2110-9-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2060-5-13**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3619**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension, shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Video swallow study.
History of Present Illness:  50-year-old woman with adenoid cystic carcinoma s/p left pneumonectomy with metastasis to liver, kidney.
presented for follow up today at Heme-onc when patient complained of chest pain [**5-4**].
Referred to the ED from outpatient chemotherapy session due to shortness of breath, chest pain, low O2 sats, tachycardia and hypotension.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia with ?
<1mm ST segment elevation, otherwise no ST-T segment abnormalities.
She [**Doctor Last Name 1834**] CTA which showed no evidence of PE, but did show new bilateral right upper and lower lobe opacities.
She was initially diagnosed with adenoid cystic carcinoma in [**Month (only) 116**] [**2102**] after presenting for an eight-month history of cough.
Chest CAT scan showed left lower lobe collapse and mediastinal enlargement encroaching on the left mainstem bronchus.
Left pneumonectomy was performed and path consistent with adenoid cystic carcinoma.
ROS: (+) fever, chills, nausea, 75 pound weight loss over several yrs since diagnosis.
No diarrhea, chest pain at this time.
Past Medical History: Oncological History: Initially diagnosed with adenoid cystic carcinoma in 5/00 after presenting with eight-month history of cough.
Chest CT showed left lower lobe collapse and mediastinal enlargement encroaching on the left mainstem bronchus.
Left pneumonectomy was performed and pathology demonstrated a 6 x 5.5-cm adenoid cystic carcinoma.
It had invaded the visceral pleura and had perineural invasion.
Pathology demonstrated a microscopic focus of residual adenoid cystic carcinoma in a bronchial wall in the submucosal area.
A CT scan in [**2105-2-23**] showed no evidence of recurrence and a bronchoscopy at that time was unremarkable.
CAT scan showed increased soft tissue thickening in the left pneumonectomy site especially near the diaphragm.
A liver hemangioma was identified.
Pathology showed adenocarcinoma in fibrous tissue.
The pathology was compared to her primary resection from [**3-/2103**] and felt to be consistent with her primary tumor.
Repeat CT after therapy showed recurrent adenoid cystic carcinoma of the trachea, now involving the lungs, pleura, and liver.
2 cycles of carboplatin/taxol for stabilization of liver lesions.
In [**1-28**], she developed left arm pain and weakness with tenderness along the medial aspect of the extremity.
Spinal MRI was negative, but brachial plexus MRI showed tumor in the left paraspinal region from T2-T5.
Most recently, from [**2109-2-23**] until [**2109-4-25**] she received four cycles of dose-reduced cisplatin and Navelbine with stable disease radiographically, but resolution of arm pain and improvement in arm strength.
CT torso from [**2109-9-19**] showed progression in the liver and kidney, and she was started on gemcitabine on [**2109-10-8**].
-low-dose Taxotere in [**11-28**] -four cycles of cisplatin and Adriamycin from [**10-28**] to [**12-30**] with initial radiographic improvement, but a CT scan in [**9-29**] revealed progression in the lungs and liver.
-Two cycles of carboplatin and Taxol were given ([**9-29**]) with stabilization of her liver lesions but continued progression in the left lung - four cycles of dose-reduced cisplatin and Navelbine ([**Date range (1) 31896**]) - Gemcitabine ([**2109-10-8**]); limited by progressive myelosuppresion - Carboplatin in [**7-/2110**] .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Adenoid cystic carcinoma as above.
Paralyzed left true vocal cord with hoarseness.
GERD s/p left pneumonectomy  Social History: She does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol.
non elevated JVP.
no neck stiffness Heart: tachycardic, regular rate and rhythm Lungs: Absent left side, clear apically right.
Sparse crackles left base Abd: soft, non tender, non distended, + BS Extrem: No edema, cyanosis of clubbing Neuro: alert oriented x 3.
No echymoses or other lesions noted.
Studies: CXR ([**8-26**]):Changes from prior left-sided pneumonectomy with calcification along the remaining cystic cavity within the left hemithorax is unchanged when compared to [**2110-4-1**].
A right subclavian CVL tip within the mid SVC is unchanged.
There is scarring at the right lung apex with post-surgical changes within the mid right lung.
There is no definite pleural effusion or focal pulmonary opacity.
No acute cardiopulmonary process identified within the right lung.
CTA CHEST ([**8-26**]): No filling defects in the pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolism.
There is no significant change in appearance of fluid filling the left hemithorax with peripheral calcifications.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There has been interval development of multiple patchy alveolar opacities throughout most of the right upper and lower lobe, most consistent with appearance of pneumonia.
The appearance of the right apical, paramediastinal and right middle lobe linear densities suggestive of scar/radiation change is stable.
Limited evaluation of upper abdominal organs demonstrates incompletely imaged hepatic lesions.
BONE WINDOWS: There is no significant change in appearance of multiple sclerotic lesions in thoracic spine as well as a deformity of the left hemithorax secondary to pneumonectomy.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Interval development of right upper and lower lobe patchy alveolar opacities, most consistent with pneumonia.
No evidence of acute infarction.
No enhancing lesions within the brain parenchyma to suggest metastases.
The status of the superior sagittal sinus is not delineated on this non-MRV exam, in the area of attenuation seen on [**2109-12-9**].
Video Swallow Study [**2110-8-29**]: FINDINGS:  The oral phase demonstrated mildly impaired bolus formation and bolus control.
There was mild-to-moderate premature spillover into the piriform sinuses with thin liquids via spoon and cup in mixed consistencies.
Minimal residue in the vallecula and piriform sinuses was seen.
Mild aspiration of occurred with cup sips of thin liquids before swallow with her head held in the neutral position.
Mild penetration was also seen with thin liquids during swallow.
A 13 mm barium pill was administered with holdup at the distal esophagus.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 50 year old female with metastatic adenoid cystic lung cancer who presented with shortness of breath, tachycardia and hypotension found to have new right upper and lower lung opacities suspicious for pneumonia.
#) Shortness of breath: Findings on imaging studies demonstrating abnormalities in right upper and lower lobes are most suspicious for community acquired pneumonia.
On history and exam, there was no evidence of fluid overload.
Initially there was no history aspiration, as she had nausea with no vomiting after chemotherapy, however speech and swallow studies demonstrated aspiration, so she was also treated for an aspiration pneumonia.
She had no recent hospitalizations to suggest other causes of pneumonia.
- Patient's shortness of breath resolved during her stay, and nasal cannula oxygen was weaned.
- It was felt that the patient's baseline blood pressure was on the lower side, with systolic in the mid 80s to low 100's, and she was mentating well without any evidence of end organ damage.
#) History pulmonary embolism and cerebral vein thrombosis: Patient has been on Coumadin for antiocoagulation, which was recently held due to supratherapeutic INR.
Her INR remained elevated during much of her stay, and her Coumadin was initially restarted, however held due to high levels, likely due to concurrent antibiotic use.
#) Chest pain: Her chest pain was chronic and pleuritic in nature.
The patient described it as dull, and has been present intermittently since development of her malignancy and sugeries.
Her EKG demonstrated ST segment changes, however her cardiac enzymes were followed and remained within normal limits.
- She continued on her home dose of Fentanyl for pain control, along with oral morphine and neurontin.
#) Tachycardia: Patient has had history of baseline tachycardia, with heart range in 120's.
Her increased heart rate was likely in part due to infection, further complicated by component of hypovolemia, and reflexive given hypotension.
She had no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
- Patient's tachycardia improved with fluid resuscitation and treatment of her infection, and was in the 90's-110's range at time of discharge.
#) Dysphagia/Poor PO intake: Patient related that she has had continued difficulty eating and swallowing, and has been eating primarily softs and fluids.
Her main difficulty remains a poor appetite which she felt was the primary reason she has not been eating very much.
- MRI did not demonstrate any central process responsible for dysphagia.
- Gastroenterology consulted to evaluate and assist with coordinating outpatient EGD with possible esophageal stent placement for her dysphagia and aspiration.
#) Prophylaxis: Patient received proton pump inhibitor, initially subcutaneous heparin (which was held due to elevated coagulation studies, which resolved with d/c of heparin), and a bowel regimen.
