He has had no visual changes in association, no N/V or drowsiness.
He does not appreciate worsening with cough/strain or sneezing.
The patient denies other difficulties, such as weakness, numbness/tingling, visual loss or diplopia, speech abnormalities, gait difficulties, vertigo, dysarthria or dysphagia.
He was taken to an outside hospital today, where head CT revealed an intracranial mass lesion.

INDICATION: 57-year-old mid patient, with endocranial mass lesion, to evaluate lesion.
FINDINGS:  There is a large heterogeneous mass lesion, in the right temporoparietal lobes, with areas of hemorrhage, cystic change, necrosis and large solid enhancing component.
There is surrounding significant vasogenic edema, with a leftward shift of subfalcine herniation; measuring approximately 1 cm is unchanged, allowing for technical differences, compared to the prior CT. Mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, is unchanged.
Large heterogeneous mass lesion in the right parietal and temporal lobes, with cystic, necrotic, hemorrhagic and solid components, the solid competent measuring 5.0 cm, with significant surrounding edema, mass effect and subfalcine herniation, and entrapment of the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] without significant change since the CT head done the day before.
1.7-cm enhancing focus in the left parapharyngeal region, representing an abnormally enlarged lymph node, representing metastatic involvement.
Contrast: MAGNEVIST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 57 year old man with parietal mass s/p resection REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: residual mass?
Assess for residual tumor.
FINDINGS: There is a lace-like pattern of enhancement along the anteromedial aspect of the right temporal lobe, apparently surrounding the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] body.
There is persistent mild dilatation of the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] tip, but substantially reduced in extent compared to the prior preoperative study.
Additionally, there is presumed hemorrhage along the operative tract, more peripherally situated within the posterior aspect of the right temporal lobe.
The extensive edema surrounding the formerly very large tumor appears unaltered in extent.
However, overall, there is somewhat less mass effect, though there is still leftward subfalcine herniation present.
Numerous tiny areas of elevated T2 signal are seen within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, presumably representing chronic small vessel infarctions or post- inflammatory residua.
There is soft tissue swelling, subgaleal in locale at the craniotomy site and there is a possible fluid collection or surgical material within the crescent- shaped space between the dura spanning the craniotomy flap and the inner table of the flap itself.
Its sharp margination seems most consistent with a benign neoplastic process (question neurogenic tumor).
This location would be very unusual for a lymph node or metastatic disease, as was suggested on the previous report.
CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that there is residual tumor in the region of the right temporal lobe surrounding the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], with mild residual entrapment of this portion of the right lateral ventricle, as described above.
Pathology pending at time of discharge  Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the neurosurgery service with an intraventricular mass in the ICU for close monitoring.
A staging CT of the torso was obtained which showed metastasis to the lungs, left hilum, and spine.
On POD#1 a repeat [**Doctor Last Name 4338**] was obtained which showed no bleeding.
