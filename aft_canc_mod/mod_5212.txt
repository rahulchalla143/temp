Admission Date:  [**2125-1-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2125-2-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2080-4-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Tegaderm / Codeine / Penicillins / Neurontin / Lorazepam / Latex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10644**] Chief Complaint: Worsening pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC placement Chemotherapy   History of Present Illness: 44 y/o male w/ metastatic renal cell carcinoma (extensive metastases to bone)who presented to clinic with worsening pain, particularly in his sacrum.
However, since then, he has called the clinic multiple times for worsening pain not covered by medications at home.
Since starting MS Contin, he has had nausea and emesis (brown, nonbloody, nonbilious).
Other than his girlfriend, the patient does not have many supports and has come to the point where he needs more care at home than outpatient services can provide.
Past Medical History: ROS: + "feeling warm", w/ temp of 99; however taking RTC tylenol at home + chills, but denies night sweats ~30# wt loss since [**11-27**] denies CP, palp, SOB denies URI sx other than mild ear pain denies LH, headaches, dizziness denies abd pain + mild odynophagia, but able to take PO liquids OK + n/v (none since yesterday) normal BM, nonbloody, no melena + numbness and tingling in genitals/buttocks since [**2125**] denies leg swelling + urinary retenion but no dysuria or hematuria .
PMH: Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (see below) Recent ?
UGIB (felt to be due to esophagitis) Thoracotomy, ex lap after stab wound Herniorrhaphy Bilateral ankle injuries .
ONC HX: In [**2124-5-22**], he was diagnosed with metastatic renal cell carcinoma following a pathological fracture of his left femur.
His leg was stabilized at [**Hospital1 336**], and a biopsy of the left thigh mass was positive for clear cell carcinoma.
A bone scan also revealed metastasis to the left distal femur and right acetabulum.
Subsequently, in a staging work-up, a torso CT also indicated two lung lesions, and a lesion in his right kidney.
Later that month, an MRI of the brain indicated a solitary enhancing mass in the right occipital lobe.
On [**2124-10-9**] the patient presented to the ED with urinary retention, numbness of his perineal area, and leg pain.
During his last admission in [**11-27**], the Sutent was stopped as it was thought it was contributing to his neutropenia and esophagitis.
His MRI head showed unchanged size of the right occipital and left temporal lesions compared with the previous MRI.
No fam hx of DM, CAD, HTN or lung disease.
Positive for renal cell carcinoma.
OP w/ small, millimeter size white lesions on roof of mouth, none under tongue/along sides of mouth.
No crackles or wheezes.
Abd: Soft, mildly distended, tender in suprapubic region.
Can not lift legs off of bed due to pain, can not hold legs in air on own due to pain thus could not assess iliopsoas.
Sensation intact to light touch, proprioception, pain bilaterally in LE to knees.
No clonus at ankles.
Pertinent Results: AXR [**2125-1-29**]: Unremarkable abdominal radiograph with no evidence of free air.
Ultrasound [**2125-1-30**]: 1) Limited study especially in distal superficial femoral vein and greater saphenous vein, however, no evidence of DVT.
2) Somewhat flattened waveform of common femoral vein.
Please perform abdominal and pelvic CT for the assessment of compression of IVC which can be a cause of symptoms and the change in waveform.
CXR [**2125-1-31**]: No evidence of active cardiopulmonary process.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Persistently dilated esophagus with new focal filling defect, probably representing residual food material.
Mostly resolved multiple nodules seen previously, with increased peribronchial patchy nodular opacities and thickening in lower lobes with moderate effusion, worrisome for aspiration or aspiration pneumonia in this patient with fever.
Unchanged enhancing right renal mass measuring 3 cm.
Unchanged 3-cm ill-defined hypodense lesion abutting the duodenum, which can be partially in the intramural location, worrisome for metastasis.
Numerous osseous metastases with soft tissue with bony destruction as described above, overall not significantly changed since prior study.
1 cm hyperdense material in the right renal pelvis.
This may represent stone or residual contrast material if there was any recent intervention.
Tib/Fib XRay [**2125-2-7**]: The portion of the intramedullary rod within the distal femur is visualized with the two distal interlocking screws.
No evidence of hardware complication is seen.
There is a healed fracture involving the mid shaft of the left fibula with mature callus.
The left tibia is within normal limits without acute fractures.
Ultrasound LLE [**2125-2-8**]: No DVT in the left lower extremity.
Head MRI [**2125-2-11**]: Interval decrease in enhancement and FLAIR signal abnormality of the right occipital lesion.
The left temporal lobe lesion is nearly non- discernable on the FLAIR and T1-weighted post-contrast images.
There is no pneumothorax.
Heterogenous opacities in both lungs are stable and may represent multifocal pneumonia and are unchanged.
There is heterogeneous opacification in the right mid and both lower lungs zones.
Whether this is atelectasis or changes due to aspiration is radiographically indeterminate.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion seen along the imaged pleural surfaces.
No pulmonary embolism.
Multifocal opacities concerning for multifocal pneumonia.
Osseous metastases with surrounding soft tissue and bone destruction, not significantly changed from [**2125-2-1**].
CXR [**2125-2-19**] Lungs clear, no evidence of failure.
CXR [**2125-2-22**] New opacity in the right mid zone concerning for pneumonia.
MRI [**2125-2-25**] No evidence for metastatic disease seen involving the cervical spine.
Stable metastatic foci involving T5 and T11 vertebra without extrinsic cord compression seen.
There is no MRI evidence for discitis or fluid collection.
No cord compression is present.
Stable metastatic disease involving the lower lumbar spine and the sacrum with pathologic compression deformity of the sacrum as noted previously and unchanged in appearance.
There is no compromise of the lumbar canal.
CXR [**2125-2-25**] Bibasilar interstitial abnormality, more pronounced on the left, has developed since [**2-22**] could represent either an atypical pneumonia or a pulmonary drug or transfusion related reaction.
Consolidation in question in the right mid lung on [**2-22**] was either spurious or has resolved.
Minimal mediastinal vascular engorgement has not changed since [**2-13**], may be a function of supine positioning.
The abnormality in the lungs is slightly more severe in the left lower lobe, the only finding that suggests this may be pneumonia.
On the other hand, there is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement and abnormality at the right lung base, suggesting this may be asymmetric edema, either cardiogenic or related to reaction to medications or drug products.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 67759**] is a 44 year old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who was admitted on [**2125-1-24**] for pain management and rehab placement.
His pain is located in his sacrum and left thigh, known sites of his metastatic disease.
His Sutent was initially held, pain service was consulted, and his pain management was adjusted according to his needs.
The night of [**1-31**], he developed a fever to 103.5 with rigors, as well as episodes of hypoxia, and was placed on levo/flagyl/vanco for several days thereafter.
He then became neutropenic (secondary to gemcitabine).
He was noted to have an exquisitely tender and tense left thigh (which was attributed to his known metastatic disease).
On [**2-7**] he noted calf pain: tib-fib film was negative for fracture/metastasis and ultrasound was negative again for DVT.
During the admission, he also developed urinary pain (despite the presence of a foley catheter); this has been controlled with oxybutynin and Pyridium.
On [**2-10**], Mr. [**Known lastname 67759**] noticed that his right foot was tremulous; a full neuro exam showed clonus and hyperreflexia in his right lower extremity, a new finding not documented previously.
The MRI was negative for cord compression and the MRI head showed improvement in his known temporal lesion.
Overnight [**Date range (1) 25388**], however, he had an episode of oxygen desaturation to mid-80's on NRB, and he was subsequently found to be hypotensive to the mid-70's systolic; he was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for better monitoring overnight.
With IV antibiotics (levofloxacin, metronidazole for presumed aspiration pneumonia) and decrease in pain medications, as well as the addition of high dose steroids, he improved and was transferred back to the oncology floor.
On [**2125-2-22**], pt spiked a temperature of 102.9 and developed a new oxygen requirement.
CXR revealed new RML infiltrate.
The etiology was most likely aspiration pneumonitis or aspiration PNA.
CXR was obtained which revealed possible atypical PNA.
He has been afebrile since [**2125-2-25**].
