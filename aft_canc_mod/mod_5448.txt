Admission Date:  [**2201-7-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2201-7-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2126-8-31**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Dilantin / Iodine; Iodine Containing  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**] Chief Complaint: Hyperglycemia Slurred speech and mental status changes   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 74 Italian man, with history significant for HTN, dyslipidemia, multiple meningiomas (followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] of Neurology) who presented to ED with word-finding difficulties on [**2201-7-5**].
Of note, he had recently received the 4th of a series of injections of a study drug to treat his recurrent meningiomas.
In [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], head CT showed stable meningioma, continued Keppra 750 mg po BID (renally dosed); Piziritide (for his meningiomas) thought to be responsible for hyperglycemia [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **]; Insulin drip stopped [**2201-7-6**], [**Last Name (un) **] recommended to keep on SSI (20U total today; highest glucose 323) for now without a fixed dose since it is thought to be drug related; He was seen by his neuro-oncologist Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] during the ICU stay.
Past Medical History: Meningioma s/p resection, for cyberknife: first seen in ER [**2198-2-25**] with headaches, found to have R parietal mass on head CT.
He was admitted to neurology for brain tumor w/u, with neurosurg consulting.
[**Month/Day/Year 4338**] with multiple lesions in brain.
Stereotactic biopsy consistent with possible grade II meningiomas (though some crush artifact, the MIB-1 was 16%, high for meningioma).
HTN Dyslipidemia Cataracts Recurrent scalp infections  Social History: Lives with wife in [**Name (NI) 86**] area.
Family History: father with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer in 70s, mother with "[**Name2 (NI) 500**] cancer" at 54; sister recently found to have brain metastases from breast cancer.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
No MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Resting bradycardia (HR<60bpm).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**12-27**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild aortic stenosis.
Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
Mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved left ventricular systolic function.
The severity of valvular disease appears similar.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 71870**] is a 74yo male with past medical history significant for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and multiple meningiomas (s/p radiation, resections, multiple graft surgeries and debridements for prior scalp infections) undergoing current chemotherapy with neuro-oncology who presents now with complaints of dysphagia and marked hyperglycemia.
The [**Last Name (un) **] consult team believes hyperglycemia is likely due to an Octreotide component of his study regimen.
His neurologic symptoms resolved prior to transfer from the ICU to the floor.
#Speech changes/ questionable dysphagia: Upon further questioning, the patient described symptoms of aphasia - word finding difficulties rather than dysphagia, though he did admit to some trouble swallowing with pills.
The aphasia was thought to be possibly due to tumor involvement of Broca's area.
These symptoms resolved in the ICU, however.
The [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes team was contact[**Name (NI) **] and they hypothesized that the hyperglycemia was secondary to the patient's chemoregimen.
#Seizure prophylaxis: His Keppra was decreased to a lower dose in the setting of the acute kidney injury on admission, and was returned to his baseline dosing once his Creatinine returned to baseline (on discharge).
#HTN: The patient's home medication metoprolol was restarted but was decreased to 37.5 mg TID out of concern for bradycardia.
Echo done given h/o hypertension and to evaluate an aortic position murmur.
It revealed a preserved EF with moderate AI, and mild AS.
His Niacin was held, as it can contribute to elevated blood sugar levels.
#Diarrhea: The patient did have 2-3 episodes of diarrhea however this resolved during his admission in the ICU.
As you know, you were here for high blood sugars that we think were caused by your chemotherapy drug.
