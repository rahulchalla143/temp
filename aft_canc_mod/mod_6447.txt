At baseline, patient reports a ~50 year history of intermittently visualizing black and white herringbone shaped "wiggles" in her L eye, lasting less 30 seconds.
At the OSH, an MRI was obtained that demonstrated a 1.5cm lesion in parietal-occipital lobe with vasogenic edema and mass effect, consistent with metastasis.

No evidence for metastatic disease.
Large hiatal hernia.
Coronary artery calcifications.
Right occipital dural-based metastasis with adjacent edema, appears slightly larger compared to [**2101-4-18**].
Status post resection of right parietal metastasis, with mild dural thickening and enhancement in this region which may be postoperative.
postop CT Head [**2101-4-26**]: IMPRESSION: Expected immediate post-surgical changes, with pneumocephalus and a small amount of intra- and extra-hemorrhage at the surgical bed.
Status post recent right parietal/occipital craniotomy for resection of posterior right parafalcine metastasis with expected post-operative changes and no definite evidence of residual tumor.
Status post more remote right parietal craniotomy for resection of an earlier metastasis; besides the post-operative changes, this operative bed also appears similar to prior with no suspicious interval change.
Brief Hospital Course: Seizure  [**Known firstname 37190**] [**Known lastname 88500**] was admitted to the hospital as a transfer from [**Location (un) **] after she had a left hand focal motor seizure without loss of consciousness.
She has no additional seizures during her hospitalizations.
Occipital mass  On MRI she was found to have a right-sided occipital lesion that was new from prior studies.
The patient underwent right occipital craniotomy for resection of posterior parietal mass under general anesthesia.
Prelim Pathology was consistent with carcinoma.
Postop head CT showed normal postop changes and moderate pneumocephalus.
