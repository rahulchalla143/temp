Admission Date:  [**2172-10-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2172-11-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2140-12-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Vancomycin / Norvasc / Iodine; Iodine Containing / Tums Anti-Gas/Antacid / Compazine / Thymoglobulin / Dilaudid  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3624**] Chief Complaint: Acute renal failure on labs, sent in from home  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left below the knee amputation (BKA) PICC line placement   History of Present Illness: 31yo man with type I diabetes mellitus and with h/o ESRD s/p living related donor kidney transplant [**2169-7-18**], s/p cadaveric pancreas transplant [**4-/2170**], admitted with abnormal lab studies.
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (3) 48551**] with a left leg infection in setting of multiple nonhealing fractures following an accident at work, treated with iv antibiotics, and currently planning for amputation.
He was seen in clinic today and found to have a rising creatinine and acidosis.
Additionally, he vomited a few times on the day prior to admission in the setting of severe pain in his left.
He has also been dyspneic on exertion due to progressive anemia and was recently started on erythropoietin injections.
Past Medical History: h/o type I diabetes mellitus s/p pancreas transplant [**2170-5-20**] ESRD s/p living related renal transplant [**2172-7-17**] Recurrent UTIs Blind in left eye d/t toxoplasmosis infection Occlusion of radial/ulnar arteries s/p eye laser surgery Diabetic retinopathy Neuropathy Fistula right arm   Social History: Lives with his parents; previously worked in a warehouse.
No history of diabetes  Physical Exam: PE: T 100.5 HR 89 BP 107/70 RR 18 99%RA Wt 73.4kg GEN: alert and oriented x3, comfortable, no acute distress HEENT: PERRL, anicteric, conjunctiva pink, oropharynx without lesion or exudate, moist mucus membranes LYMPH: no anterior/posterior cervical, occipital, or supraclavicular adenopathy CARDIOVASCULAR: PMI nondisplaced, regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops LUNGS: clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally without rhonchi, wheezes, or crackles ABDOMEN: midline ventral hernia at surgical scar, soft, nontender, nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.
no hepatosplenomegaly by percussion or palpation.
No intracranial bleed or obvious masses.
Persistent left globe opacification consistent with known history of retinal hemorrhage and toxoplasmosis.
These changes are congruent with chronic osteomyelitis.
Reticular subcutaneous edema and muscle edema of the left lower extremity, however, no discrete abscess or fluid collection is seen.
Lack of intravenous contrast did limit the sensitivity for detection of small abscesses.
Progressive collapse of the tibiotalar joint with resorption of the distal tibia and collapse and resorption of the talar dome.
Fractured third distal most screw again noted.
The findings are congruent with reported history of chronic osteomyelitis, however neuropathic joint would have a similar appearance.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Brief Hospital Course: 31 yo man with h/o ESRD s/p living related renal transplant [**2168**] and type I diabetic s/p pancreas transplant [**2169**], admitted with acute renal failure/elevated creatinine, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and progressive anemia.
# Fevers / Osteomyelitis Patient presented with neutropenia and fevers.
The neutropenia was considered secondary to tacrolimus / sirolimus toxicity.
He was initially started on cefepime / daptomycin for febrile neutropenia (vancomycin allergic).
Blood cultures were positive for enterococcus sensitive to ampicillin.
X-rays of the left leg showed chronic osteomyelitis.
He was provided opiate pain medication for pain control.
He was started on daptomycin and cefipime, when he was febrile w/ neutropenia before culture data returned and then transitioned to IV ampicillin.
Given his risk of poor post-surgical healing, stump shinkers should not be used.
# Respiratory Failure On hospital day 6 the patient was found by the renal fellow at 11am to be unresponsive w/ shallow infrequent respirations.
He awoke immediately and suffered withdrawal symptoms of rigors, chills, and vomiting.
His MICU course was notable for 2 additional doses of narcan for mild somnolence without frank respiratory depression.
He was also noted to have intermittent hypertension which were attributed to both acute opiate withdrawal induced by the narcan.
IV Diliaudid ended up causing nausea / vomiting, and he was transitioned to tylenol.
# Neutropenia Initially neutropenic, likely secondary to medications (rapamycin toxicity).
# Cellular Atypia / PTLD After the patient's WBC# started to return to normal, the differential and manual analysis were noted to have many atypical cell lines and morphologies.
Heme-Onc was consulted to comment on whether these abnormalities were consistent w/ a lymphoproliferative process.
Heme/Onc considered the atypia secondary to a reactive process (s/p infection / suppression).
However, EBV viral load was measured to assess for risk of post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder.
# Nausea / Vomiting The patient suffered intractable nausea / vomiting after his repiratory code, and especially after the surgery.
The N/V was zofran, and a head CT was also performed to rule out metastasis / mass lesions (unremarkable for this).
Amylase / Lipase were normal repeatedly; his sxs were not considered secondary to pancreatitis or rejection.
# ARF on CKD Urine studies showed ATN.
Blood levels of tacrolimus / sirolimus were checked and found to be markedly elevated (Tac 10.8; Sirolimus 13.6).
He will follow up w/ renal next week for labs and re-visit w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
# HTN Pt remained hypertensive during hospitalization, however was asymptomatic.
# Anemia He received 2 units of PRBCs initially and another 2 units just prior to his BKA.
# Depression Continued Lexapro .
# Hypercholesterolemia Continued Lipitor .
