Coarsened interstitial markings are again noted and may reflect underlying scarring, better assessed on prior CT. Areas of traction bronchiectasis in the right middle lobe likely accounts for the increased opacity seen in the right medial cardiophrenic recess.

Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.
She presented to the emergency department with an episode of shortness of breath after taking an entire bottle of mag-citrate.
Her shortness of breath improved to her baseline.
She was found on CT to have a stricture in the ascending colon.
She had an NSTEMI/demand ischemia event a few weeks ago in the setting of a GI bleed and bowel prep.
She had a slightly elevated troponin which was likely residual from her previous event.
#CHF: Patient was volume overloaded in the ED.
Her breathing and clinical exam greatly improved.
An echocardiogram showed an EF of > 55% with severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
#AF: She had a history of atrial fibrillation.
During the hospitalization, her rate became irregular with bigeminy and rapid ventricular response.
# GI: During the patient's recent hospitalization she was unable to complete the  bowel prep because of her NSTEMI/demand ischemia.
Her abdominal symptoms of bloating, cramping, distention, and constipation worsened throughout this hospital stay cosistent with a high grade partial obstruction.
A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a stricture in the ascending colon.
She was evaluated for MI and her EKGs and cardiac enzymes were reassuring.
On exam, she had no signs of heart failure and did respond to IV fluids.
She was transferred to the VICU, and then to the SICU for close monitoring for her asymptomatic hypotension and rapid heart rate requoring medications and fluids.
On POD#5, she started having small amounts of hematochezia.
She had tachycardia to 110-120s.
