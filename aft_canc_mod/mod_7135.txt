Admission Date:  [**2159-3-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2159-4-1**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 84yo male with a history of congestive heart failure and multiple recent admissions was admitted from home with increased light-headedness and found to have acute renal failure.
He reports no LOC or hitting his head.
He reports sensation of knees buckling.
He was asymptomatic at rest.
The patient denies any chest pain or pressure, new exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, PND or leg edema, palpitations, claudication-type symptoms, melena, rectal bleeding, or transient neurologic deficits.
No change in weight, bowel habit or urinary symptoms.
No cough, fever, night sweats, arthralgias, myalgias, headache or rash.
Of note, patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 104757**]/09 for dyspnea and CHF exacerbation.
Given a rise in his creatinine on the 48 hours prior to discharge, he was ultimately discharged on a regimen of torsemide 60mg [**Hospital1 **] without metolazone.
His exam was notable for clear lungs, no peripheral edema.
His labs were notable for mild hyponatremia at 130, acute renal failure with a creatinine of 4.3.
Valvular heart disease (MODERATE MR) 5.
Hyperlipidemia 6.
Hypertension 9.
Severe leg pain  PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 1.
Family History: His father died at 90 of cancer in the brain and his mother at 52 of breast cancer.

CARDIAC: Regular rhythm; [**2-23**] Holosystemic murmurs best heard in LLSB, no rubs, or gallops.
Obese, Non-distended, and soft without tenderness EXTREMITIES:trace peripheral edema B/L, warm without cyanosis NEUROLOGIC: Alert and appropriate.
No pronator drift.
Brief Hospital Course: 84yo male with a history of diastolic CHF, hypertension, and severe mitral regurgitation was admitted with acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, and hyponatremia.
Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury-Etiology of his acute kidney injury is likely related to pre-renal causes such as aggressive diuresis, starting an ACEI, and a fluid restricted PO intake.
Additional possibilities include allergic interstitial nephritis secondary to metolazone as this was a new medication for him during his previous admission.
Post-renal causes are also possible given his BPH, although he has been draining urine without problem.
[**Name (NI) **] consistent with prerenal azotemia.
Acute on Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure-Patient has had very difficult to manage heart failure in the past, resulting in multiple frequent admissions and aggressive diuresis.
Held torsemide on admission bc of ARF but restarted 20mg PO BID upon discharge when renal function returned to baseline.
Resumed ACEI in the setting of acute renal failure.
Held off on resuming BB because of borderline low BP.
Hypotension- He was asymptomatic at rest and mentating well.
That coupled with reinstiution of antihypertensives for needed for CHF and volume depletion in the setting of overdiuresis were likely.
Mitral Regurgitation- Patient had a history of mitral regurgitation and on a recent [**Hospital1 113**], this was noted to be worsened over the last 2-3 months.
Continue to hold dexamethasone secondary to fluid overload.
BPH -Patient has a history of BPH and bladder spasms.
Held finasteride for hypotension but consider restarting as outpatient.
# Back PAin -Patient felt like his fall prior to admission exacerbated old back injury.
No neurologic deficits nor TTP.
Outpatient Lab Work Daily electrolytes, specifically potassium, and renal function   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 4657**] - [**Location 1268**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Acute Renal Failure Mitral Regurgitation Hypotension .
Secondary: Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure   Discharge Condition: Stable, satting well on room air.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because of low blood pressures causing you to feel lightheaded.
We also found you to have acute renal failure which we thought was due to too much diuretic.
We gave you fluids which held your blood pressure medications and diuretics which both improved your renal failure and low blood pressure.
If you experience any of the following, chest pain, shortness of breath at rest or with exertion, cough, fever, chills, swelling in your legs, nausea, vomiting, or dizziness please call your doctor or go to your local emergency room.
