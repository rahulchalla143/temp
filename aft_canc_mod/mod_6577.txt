Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: This is a 60 yo M with a history of throat cancer and presumed lung cancer, with metastases to brain and bone who presents with tachypnea.
# Tachypnea: Patient had CT chest 2 days prior to admission that showed bilateral pulmonary and pleural masses, effusions, collaps, and lymphadenopathy.
Extreme worsening in malignancy in a short period.
Patient has history of bilateral PEs, and is on therapeutic lovenox.
Given extent of disease burden and impending intubation proceeding with intubation did not seem appropriate.
Discussed potential futility of thoracentesis on pleural effusion as not likely to benefit his state.
Given metastatic disease with such poor prognosis decision was made with family to make the patient comfort measures.
I maintained the patient on stool softeners, and keppra as I deemed this to be discomforting to the patient if he would have a seizure or become constipated.
Discussed pain and sedation options with family and patient.
He was tachypneic but without increased cough, secretions or overt pain.
# Metastatic Cancer: Patient with known throat cancer, and presumed lung cancer, with history of mets to brain, bone, and lung.
# Bilateral PE: Unlikely source of tachypnea.
