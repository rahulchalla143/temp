He also reported increasing oxygen requirement at home.
Status post right hemicolectomy for a benign tumor in '[**18**].
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  After the cardiac catheterization (see below), it was determined by enzymes that the patient sustained an acute myocardial infarction, however, he remained hemodynamically stable throughout his hospital stay.
The patient was initially admitted to the CCU after his complaints of chest pain, worsening shortness of breath, and an EKG revealing sinus tachycardia with a right bundle branch block pattern, right axis deviation, and ST depressions in the inferolateral leads.
It was suspected that patient had cardiac tamponade.
He was transferred from the CCU to the MICU after he was intubated secondary to hypoxia.
However, he continued to have an increased oxygen requirement likely secondary to worsening metastatic lung cancer as well as what was identified to be pneumonia from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
In terms of his GI bleed after one or two blood transfusions, hematocrit stabilized, and the decision was made for no intervention.
CAUSE OF DEATH:  Metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer leading to respiratory failure.
