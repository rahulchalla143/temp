A biopsy of the fundus was done via esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder.
She was readmitted late [**2196-10-17**] with fever and abdominal pain similar to this presentation.
A renal mass lesion biopsy was consistent with post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder.
Creatinine was increased, and she was diagnosed with acute rejection.
On the night prior to admission she spiked a temperature of 102 and began to have diffuse abdominal pain.
Droperidol was given, and her nausea and vomiting resolved.
An abdominal CT was done which revealed a small amount of free fluid but was otherwise negative.
She was admitted because of concern for acute rejection versus infection in an immunocompromised host.
Bipolar disorder.
End-stage renal disease secondary to lithium toxicity in [**2189**].
CMV disease diagnosed several weeks prior to PTLD, treated with prolonged course of IV ganciclovir.
ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:   A family history of hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, high cholesterol, and thyroid disease.
In general, she was a cushingoid-appearing woman, uncomfortable, but in no acute distress.
Neck was supple with no jugular venous distention.
No wheezes, crackles, or rales.
Heart had a regular rate and rhythm, a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the base.
Obese with positive graft tenderness in the right lower quadrant.
Extremities had no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A CT scan revealed stable masses in the transplant and kidney, consistent with post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder.
New free fluid around the liver, spleen, and slightly increased free fluid in the pelvis.
Stable right upper lobe pulmonary nodule and small subcapsular hematoma in the transplanted kidney.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   Ms. [**Known lastname 35431**] was admitted with a presumed diagnosis of acute rejection of her cadaveric renal transplant.
A renal biopsy was done which revealed an ischemic change and mild mesangial prominence, minimal interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, diffuse interstitial edema, and a mild diffuse/chronic inflammatory interstitial infiltrate with very rare foci of mild tubulitis.
Numerous small interstitial eosinophilic granules were noted which were consistent with apoptotic debris from the patient's lymphoproliferative disorder.
Several foci of endothelialitis were noted in arterials and arteries.
While there was no overt cellular rejection on the biopsy specimen, there was interstitial edema and significant endothelialitis.
Low dose rapamycin which she had been started on admission had been discontinued because of the pancytopenia she had developed.
POST-TRANSPLANTATION LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDER:  The patient received her second and third doses of rituximab for this during this hospitalization, and she had a follow-up CT scan which revealed slight improvement.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  She had low-grade temperatures during her hospital course, and there was no evidence of focal infection, however, and the fevers were attributed to her acute rejection.
She received valganciclovir initially, but then that was held because of possible bone marrow suppression.
She had numerous tests checked for possible viral infection including cytomegalovirus, [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus, HHB6, and parvovirus B19 PCR.
PANCYTOPENIA:  This was believed to be secondary to medication use, but there was also concern about viral etiology.
Her valganciclovir was held, and she received Neupogen for her decreased white blood cell count.
NEUROLOGY/PSYCHIATRY:  She was followed by the Psychiatry liaison consultation team because of her bipolar disorder, and they continued her medication of Lamictal, Depakote, Zoloft, and Ativan p.r.n.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  She had episodes of nausea and vomiting; however, these resolved spontaneously, and no etiology was found.
