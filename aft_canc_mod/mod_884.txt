CXR No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Stable appearance of fibrosis and atelectasis at the right lung base, right lung volume loss, and cardiomegaly.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**11-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2164-9-20**], the RV has further dilated and systolic function has deteriorated.
Brief Hospital Course: 68F h/o 2L home O2, congenital ASD s/p repair, obstructive/restrictive lung disease, chronic pulmonary emboli, severe pulmonary hypertension on sildenifil, presenting with progressive dyspnea most c/w COPD flare with a question of PNA.
# Respiratory status: The pt has had worsening symptoms over 2 weeks.
She had no need for bipap or intubation this admission.
Her worsening respiratory status was felt to be most likely secondary to a COPD flare w/ possible RLL pneumonia.
The patient was negative for flu and sputum, blood and urine cultures were pending at discharge.
She was also started on a prednisone taper and Levofloxacin 750 mg PO Q48H (impaired GFR) x5 days for COPD flare  For her pulmonary HTN: sildenafil TID, *** NOT [**Hospital1 **] *** (pt had decreased frequency but should be on TID per pulmonary).
She was continued on her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]: Atovaquone and continued on anticoagulation for her chronic pulmonary emboli.
# Supratheraputic INR: Admitted with INR >3, but quickly decreasing INR -Neg LENI, no new PE per CTA PE protocol -Warfarin restarted at 3mg daily x 3 days per [**Hospital 197**] Clinic RN.
# Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr 1.1, GFR near 50, stable during this admission.
# Hyponatremia: On presentation the patient had mild hyponatremia which resolved during her stay.
# Pain at ventral hernia/hiatal hernia site: This pain resolved over course of admission.
Ventral hernia remains reducible.
The patient was treated with GI cocktail PRN (pt c/o indigestion) and Simethicone PRN (pt c/o gas).
# h/o atrial fibrillation: Warfarin initially restarted at lower than home dose  and the patient was continued on sotalol and digoxin.
# Diastolic dysfunction: The patient was restarted on her home regimen of Furosemide.
# Elevated TropT: STABLE.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: [**4-4**] mL PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.

Secondary diagnosis # Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because of extreme shortness of breath.
We treated you for a COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) flare, and started you on a steroid taper as well as levofloxacin (an antibiotic).
