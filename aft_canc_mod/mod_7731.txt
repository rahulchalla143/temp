Similar in nature to abdominal pain in [**2-8**], when he was found to have a UTI.
Associated with lightheadedness with standing.
UA dirty, but no bacteria.
He had a renal u/s to rule out hydronephrosis.
CT torso was done (wanted to eval abd/pelvis, patient was due for CT torso in a week), which showed colitis.
The patient was still having [**7-6**] abdominal pain in the periumbilical region and lower quadrants, up to [**10-6**] with palpation.
No nausea, vomiting.
Past Medical History: [**8-/2158**] Initial presentation  with nocturia, nausea and LUQ pain weight loss (16lb over 2mo).
Imaging revealed extensive peritoneal and omental nodularity which appearance was consistent with carcinomatosis as well as right hydronephrosis and hydroureter secondary to a mass versus lymphadenopathy at the base of the right ureter.
Numerous lesions medial to the right psoas.
Right lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
A CT-guided biopsy of the omentum revealed malignant cells, consistent with well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, favoring a colorectal / appendiceal origin, supported by positive AE [**12-31**] and CDX2 immunostains.
[**2159-7-23**]: Cycle # 8, D# 15 : discontinue Oxaliplatin due to neuropathy [**12/2159**] CT torso: stable disease.

Hyperemia, wall thickening and fat stranding in the sigmoid colon could be due to a primary colitis of inflammatory or infectious etiology with reactive changes in the distal ileum.
A small bowel etiology is considered less likely.
Non-visualization of the previously noted right pulmonary nodule secondary to atelectasis.
No new pulmonary nodules noted.
No evidence of hydronephrosis in the right kidney and normal appearance of the nephroureteral stent.
Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver.
Bilateral renal cysts.
