Admission Date:  [**2165-6-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2165-6-10**]   Service:  CARDIAC IC  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83-year-old male with no prior known coronary artery disease, who presents with crushing substernal chest pain beginning at 5 PM tonight.
He tried Tums with no relief.
There was no radiation or diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, and no dyspnea.
He present to [**Hospital 47**] [**Hospital **] Hospital, where EKG was consistent with an anterior myocardial infarction.
He was pain free on the flight over to our hospital and afterwards.
The left heart catheterization revealed the a patent left vein coronary artery, mild irregularities of the left circumflex artery.
There were mild irregularities of the right coronary artery and the left anterior descending artery was noted to have diffuse disease.
There as TIMI III flow throughout the artery.
Angioplasty was attempted of the D2, but there was a proximal dissection, which was treated with 1??????
minutes of angioplasty and this dissection was felt to be stable.
There was TIMI III flow in the LAD, as well as in the diagonal II following the intervention.
Right heart catheterization revealed elevated filling pressures with a right atrial pressure of 21, pulmonary artery pressure of 47/20, and mean pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure of 26.
The patient was brought to the Coronary Intensive Care Unit on the basis of these elevated filling pressures, as well as the patient's advanced age.
Melanoma in his right eye, prostate cancer, status post local XRT, left-sided chest pain status post extensive cardiac workup including multiple negative stress tests.
GENERAL:   The patient is alert, in bed, and in no acute distress.
NECK:  There was no JVD and no lymphadenopathy.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
The groin was notable for arterial and venous sheets in place in the right groin.
EXTREMITIES: Extremities were 2+ DP pulses and no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Chest x-ray, by report, showed mediastinal widening, but no CHF.
Transthoracic echocardiogram by report showed no evidence of aortic dissection.
There was [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in leads 1 and AVL and there was T-wave inversion in lead [**Street Address(2) 42984**] depression.
There was Q wave in leads V1 through V3, T-wave inversion in leads V1 through V5, T-wave flattening in leads V6, 1, and AVL, and 1 to [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevation in leads V2 to V4.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 83-year-old man with acute anterior myocardial infarction this evening, who received thrombolysis at the outside hospital and was Medflighted here for percutaneous coronary intervention.
Stent was placed in the mid LAD at the diagonal 2, restoring flow to a 90% lesion there.
There was apical dyskinesis with mild and distal anteroseptal and distal anterior akinesis.
There was trace AI, mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR and no LV function thrombus.
The patient remained chest-pain free, however, he did have continued mild dyspnea, especially on exertion.
Given the patient's elevated filling pressures and his depressed ejection fraction after his MI, we initiated therapy with Furosemide that improved his symptoms somewhat, although, not completely.
We noted that the patient had had baseline dyspnea on exertion even before his MI, but he stated that his symptoms were worse during this hospitalization than he is used to prior.
There was significant hematuria noted and this was felt to be likely multifactorial due to his thrombolysis, Integrilin, and history of local XRT that made possible the diagnosis of radiation cystitis.
Foley catheter was removed and replaced with condom catheter and Pyridium was given for symptomatic benefit.
However, the patient continued to have complaints of urgency and frequency.
There were no bleeding complications.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had a temperature spike to 100.9 on the night prior to discharge and this resolved spontaneously the following morning.
We assumed the source to be his urinary tract infection and instructed the patient about signs and symptoms to watch for, that would be concerning for pneumonia, cellulitis, etc.
Anterior myocardial infarction.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35% to 40%.
Urinary tract infection.
