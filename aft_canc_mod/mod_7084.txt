He developed wheezing at home today and took 30 prednisone but was then found lying in his back yard cyanotic.
On the scene they reported no air movement.
He states that his symptoms came on relatively suddenly and did not include any itching/rash/angioedema/runny eyes/rhinorrhea as well as no chest pain or nausea.
Prior to the asa desensitization, his last severe attack requiring ED visit was 30 years ago.
In his 20s, he had frequent ED visits (sometimes up to three times weekly), but only one hospital admission and no intubations.
He failed and actually had a paradoxical reaction to inhaled steroids and has been prednisone dependent for 10 years.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for severe respiratory distress.
The cause of your respiratory distress was likely secondary to your asthma and the trigger is unclear but may have been related to aspirin therapy.
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU DO NOT RESTART TAKING ASPIRIN ON YOUR OWN - BECAUSE YOU MISSED A DOSE YOU ARE NO LONGER DESENSITIZED AND RESTARTING PUTS YOU AT RISK FOR WORSENING ASTHMA/ANAPHYLAXIS.
