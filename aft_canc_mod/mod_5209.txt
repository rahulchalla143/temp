Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation Cardiac cath with stent placmenent & Valvulopasty Chest tube placement   History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **]yo F with PMH significant for HTN, colon CA, hyperlipidemia, and CAD who presented to [**Hospital3 **] on the evening of [**7-8**] with sudden onset CP.
A chest CT-angiogram was done, which was reportedly negative for pulmonary embolus.
Initial ECG demonstrated a junctional rhythm with new 2-3mm inferior and anterolateral ST depressions and ST elevations in AVR and V1.
ECG demonstrated junctional rhythm with HR 60 with persistent lateral ST depressions, but resolving ST depressions in inferior leads and resolving ST elevations in AVR and V1.
CXR demonstrated hyperinflation with hilar congestion and possible R-sided consolidation--question of PNA.
She was admitted to CCU for further management of NSTEMI, CHF and respiratory distress.
Past Medical History: HTN Hyperlipidemia ?CAD - note made of h/o angina h/o Colon CA s/p resection s/p hip fracture with THR Vit B12 deficiency   Social History: Lives in senior housing where meals are prepared for her.
No h/o lung problems or use of home O2.
NAD HEENT: PERRL, MMM CV: RRR, II/VI harsh SEM radiating to carotids, II/IV diastolic murmur Chest: Coarse BS diffusely, no rales.
Abd: Soft, NT/ND, +BS, no HSM Extr: 1+ LE edema bilaterally, 2+ DPs bilaterally Neuro: Intubated, sedated.
No focal deficits.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include anterior hypokinesis with distal septal akinesis.
There is severe aortic  valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is minimal to mild mitral stenosis.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: #Cardiovascular-   STEMI:  Pt found to have NSTEMI with troponin peaking 1.232.
Trigger for MI may have been plaque rupture or, also, demand-supply mismatch in the setting of possible PNA & respiratory failure.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2128-7-12**] revealed normal LMCA, 70-80% calcified stenosis of LAD, small LCx, and RCA with 90% mid-occlusion.
NSTEMI & post-cath therapy included ASA, Plavix, and heparin gtt.
CHF: Pulmonary edema on admission thought to be due to CHF.
Echo on [**7-9**] revealed moderate to severe AS (tx'd at cath) and an EF of 45 to 55%.
It appears that pt may have mild CHF.
After admission, she showed few if any signs of heart failure.
Her rapid afib seemed to respond best to the diltiazem & amiodarone.
# Aortic Stenosis: Found to have moderate to sever AS on echo.
Failed extubation on [**7-12**], after developing worsening pulmonary edema.
RLL PNA/infx: afebrile on admission, though CXR suspicious for PNA.
Pt tx'd with azithromycin, ceftriaxone & levofloxacin, which were d/c'd after concern of pt developing ATN w/ azithro & CTX and of further prolonging QTc interval.
Pan-cultured, yielding no evidence of infection.
While WBC has declined somewhat, it is still elevated,  The differential has shown persistent monocytosis (>4,000 u/L) along with promyelocytes and metamyelocytes on peripheral smear.
They have recommended a number of blood tests (including a complete anemia evaluation and cytogenetic testing).
Iron studies revealed a nml iron level (88) and an elevated ferritin (226).
Exact cause of her ARF is unclear.
#Coagulation issues: after pt was started on coumadin for afib, she developed a supratherapeutic INR.
She continued on tube feeds s/p extubation after failing two swallowing evaluations.
She underwent a third swallowing evaluation with video imaging, which revealed that she could safely take ground solids and nectar thick liquids.
Required wrist restraints & a sitter for short period.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Life Care Center - [**Location (un) 3320**]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1.Hypoxic respiratory failure 2.Non-ST elevation MI s/p percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography with Sirolimus-eluting stents 3.CHF (diastolic) 4.Atrial fibrillation (rate & rhythm controlled) 5.Anemia 6.?Myeloproliferative disorder 7.Dysphagia requiring ground & nectar thick liquids 8.Hard of hearing   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
