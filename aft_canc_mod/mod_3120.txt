Admission Date:  [**2196-12-27**]     Discharge Date:  [**2197-1-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2124-10-17**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old man with past medical history significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease, status post non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in [**2196-12-21**] as well as retinal detachment bilaterally [**2194**], memory loss, and prostate cancer status post brachytherapy.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Three to four ounces of scotch per night, no cigarettes.
This is a 72-year-old man who presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital five days prior to admission to [**Hospital1 188**] with acute onset of shortness of breath and pulmonary edema, found to be in a hypertensive crisis at 200/110, however, no chest pain at the time with troponins peaking [**12-21**] at 2.5 with flat CKs.
Patient had a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.
Cardiac catheterization was performed at that time, which revealed 70% ostial left anterior descending artery stenosis with proximal 85% stenosis, 80% stenosis of the third diag, 80% stenosis of the OM-3, 90% stenosis of the right coronary artery.
Because there was questionable plaque in the aorta, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] requested a neurologic assessment on the patient, therefore the patient was reversed and passed the neurologic assessment, but because the patient's blood pressures were up in the 180s and 190s, the patient was placed on propofol to try to get the blood pressure back under control.
Patient still had difficulty with his blood pressures staying high in the 140s to 160s while on Nipride and nitroglycerin as well as propofol, however, there was a period at which time the blood pressure dipped down to 70s, at which time all of the hypertensive medications were stopped with a little Neo-Synephrine and fluid bolus given which resolved the issue.
Vital signs stable.
Plan was to restart the patient's beta blockers, to administer 20 mg of Lasix [**Hospital1 **], to administer hydralazine to keep the blood pressure under control, and to continue the chest tube since the patient still had a high output, and to restart the patient the dimension medications.
Patient had a low grade temperature of 100, white count of 13.4, hematocrit of 30.3, and in sinus rhythm at 80 with stable blood pressure 130/50.
Chest tubes still putting out serosanguinous fluid.
Postoperative day four, no new cardiac issues overnight with less confusion, mentating well, and decreased chest tube drainage.
The patient is afebrile in sinus rhythm at 61, blood pressure still elevated at 171/77, sating at 97% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
Postoperative day six, patient still with persistent hypertension, however, doing very well otherwise despite multiple medication adjustments, still afebrile in sinus rhythm at 80 with a plan to continue to titrate captopril and possibly switching over to Accupril which the patient was on preoperatively.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting x3.
