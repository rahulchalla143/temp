She has been confused - less able to know what's happening and where she is - for the last month, but again much worse over the past 48 hours, not knowing her daughter's name and becoming very agitated at her environment and people in it, much unlike her.
With these concerns, her daughter brought her to [**Hospital3 20445**] today, where a head CT revealed a 2-cm mass in her right cerebellum.
She was given 125 mg IV SoluMedrol and 1 mg po Ativan (for agitation - she was screaming about wanting to go home), and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
Past Medical History: PMH: Anemia, refused colonoscopy HTN HLD DM2 s/p knee replacements with metal s/p cataract surgery OS Paralyzed vocal cord for last month, diagnosed by ENT today  Medications: Furosemide 40 mg po daily Vytorin 20 mg daily Lisinopril 10 mg po daily Glipizide 5 mg po bid  Allergies: NKDA   Social History: Social Hx: Smoked 1 ppd for many years.
Language is limited to one- or two-word responses.
There were no paraphasic errors.
Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.
She does not comply with formal strength testing, but does lift B UEs off bed for 10 count with some drift of L UE; holds L LE off bed for 5-count; does not hold R LE but does lift it in response to tickle.
No evidence of malignancy.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the neurology service, where cerebellar mass was found, as well as lung masses.
These were shown to be small-cell lung cancer on node biopsy.
After extensive discussion of her diagnosis and prognosis with the family, heme-onc, and palliative care, therapeutic options including VP shunt, radiation and chemotherapy were deemed to risk more discomfort to the patient than benefit.
