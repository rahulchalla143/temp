Admission Date:  [**2197-11-21**]       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2137-4-27**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**Location (un) **] MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60 year old woman with a history of Stage 3A nonsmall cell lung cancer, status post right pneumonectomy whose medical course was further complicated by bronchopleural fistula and development of empyema in the pneumonectomy cavity.
She has also had stenosis of her left main stem bronchus for which she had stent placed.
She has had multiple episodes of pneumonia/bronchitis with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the past and most recently with Pseudomonas.
Her course has also been complicated by bronchopleural fistula.
Over the past three days the patient has experienced increasing shortness of breath and secretions.
She denies fevers, chills or chest pains.
She was admitted to computerized tomography scan on [**11-21**] for rigid bronchoscopy.
Following the bronchoscopy in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit she was complaining of increased shortness of breath.
She continued to experience increased secretions and respiratory distress over night and was taken for an urgent rebronchoscopy, both flexible and rigid.
She was found to have a patent left main stem with moderate secretions.
The stent was removed and a biopsy was done around the site to rule out recurrent cancer.
There was also noticed to be a 2 mm right posterior fistula consistent with her bronchopleural fistula.
Following the procedure she continued to have large amount of secretions and respiratory distress and was ultimately intubated.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial examination prior to transfer to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit she was sedated but reactive in no acute distress.
Her neck was supple without lymphadenopathy.
Her chest had loud upper respiratory sounds but was clear at the left base.
Heart was regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub or gallop and slightly tachycardiac.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Bronchial washings from her initial rigid bronchoscopy showed 3+ polymorphonucleocytes and 4+ gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters with heavy growth of Staphylococcus aureus.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit where she was watched carefully and sources for her respiratory distress were investigated.
She had a good oxygenation, adequate ventilation and minimal secretions throughout her stay.
It was felt that her failure to wean off of the ventilator may have been related to anxiety.
She underwent bronchoscopy on at least a couple of occasions to verify that secretions were adequate and there was no mucous plugging or other explanation for why she might be failing extubation, weaning.
These studies revealed no clear reason for why she should be having difficulty weaning from the ventilator.
She was also started on Ceftazidime and Vancomycin given the presence of both Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas in her sputum.
From a cardiovascular perspective her cardiac enzymes were cycled to rule out the possibility of myocardial infarction.
Nevertheless, chest computerized tomography scan was obtained with angiography to rule out pulmonary embolus.
Nevertheless, she had significant respiratory distress and began desaturating into the 80s, 70s and even 60s.
In addition to her pulmonary difficulties during this admission the patient also experienced an upper gastrointestinal bleed on [**11-24**].
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed esophagitis with superficial ulcerations which were thought to be consistent with nasogastric tube trauma.
It should be noted that the patient was a very difficult cross-match and it took nearly 36 hours to locate compatible blood for transfusion.
Fortunately she experienced no further bleeding episodes and remained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint throughout her admission.
From an oncological perspective biopsies done at the time of her bronchoscopy ultimately showed poorly differentiated nonsmall cell carcinoma.
It became clear that the patient's pulmonary status is not such much an acute decompensation as it is representation of a continuing decline in her pulmonary status over the past several months.
