MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] gadolinium is more sensitive for detection of intracranial metastatic disease.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.

Minor non-specific inferior repolarization abnormalities.
Discharge Labs:   Brief Hospital Course: 65 y/oM with pancreatic adenocarcinoma now on taxotere presents with falls in the setting of hyperglycemia and orthostatic hypotension.
Overnight his hyperglycemia and hypovolemia were managed with 1/2NS and insulin drip transitioned to NPH [**Hospital1 **] when resuming PO intake.
The patient was found to have a UTI and started on Vanc/Zosyn with levo for ?
While awaiting callout, the patient developed worsening hyperglycemia and was kept in the ICU overnight for management.
HYPOTENSION: Hypotension most likely related to increased GU losses [**2-22**] to osmotic diurresis and possibly underlying infection such as C-diff; cardiogenic and adrenal shock were ruled out.
The patient did not appear to be septic and was normotensive in ICU and on floor.
C. diff: the patient's stool cultures were positive for C. diff so he was started on Flagyl.
URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): There was initial concern for UTI however cultures did not grow.
FALL(S): The patients recent falls are most likely due to recent hypovolemia in the setting of hyperglycemia.
His history of a-fib appear to be well controlled on his two beta blockers so this is less likely a reason.
Additionally, his hyperglycemia was brought under control so that he did not continue to have osmotic diurresis.
?s hyperglycemia was likely due to pancreatic insufficiency in the setting of pancreatic cancer and s/p whipple.
Mucocytis: Patient has chemotherapy induced mucocytis without neutropenia.
This likely contributed to his hypovolumic state [**2-22**] to decreased PO intake due to discomfort ingesting fluids and food.
CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), PANCREAS: Likely he has increased tumor burden in setting of his h/o pancreatic cancer.
HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY): resolved with glucose correction  ANEMIA, ACUTE on CHRONIC: Anemia secondary to probable anemia of chronic disease and underlying infection and possible bone marrow suppression from chemotherapy.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE): He was ruled out for MI and continued on his home dose of plavix.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Resolved with Hydration  A-Fib:  Patient had one a-fib event on morning of 3rd hospital day that was not associated with chest pain, sob but was associated with fever to 101.7.
He had otherwise stable vital signs and his afib tachycardia to the 160s was brought down with beta blocker therapy and by placing him on his home beta blocker regimen over the course of his stay.
Zolpidem 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as needed for insomnia.
C-diff GI infection 2.
Hyperglycemia/new diagnosis of diabetes 3.
Hypotension related to hypovolemia 4.
Atrial fibrillation  Secondary 1.
Hypertension 2.
Pancreatic cancer   Discharge Condition: Stable to home with good glycemic control and heart rate.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for very low blood pressure and elevated blood sugar level.
During your hospital stay, you were found to have a heart condition called atrial fibrillation which causes your heart to beat very fast.
Your treatment included intravenous fluids for your low blood pressure, insulin for your elevated blood surgar levels, and beta blockers for the atrial fibrillation.
During your hospital course you were found to have an infection in your gastrointestinal system called c-diff.
You were instructed on how to manage your new diagnosis of diabetes and were seen by endocrinologists from the [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes center.
