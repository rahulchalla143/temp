Admission Date:  [**2125-2-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2125-2-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2078-7-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Vicodin / Sustiva  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5755**] Chief Complaint: acute renal failure and pneumonia (transfer from outside hospital)  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bronchoscopy, lumbar puncture x2  History of Present Illness: Pt 46 y/o female with PMHx significant for HIV who presented to Good [**Hospital 5159**] Hospital on [**2125-2-5**] with cough, fever, and diarrhea.
At that point she had CT chest which showed dense consolidation of RUL with b/l ground glass air space disease throughout both lobes.
While at the OSH patient also developed ARF with Cre going from 2.7 on admission to 5.5 on day of transfer.
Renal was consulted and felt could be secondary to volume depleation from diarrhea.
She was started on bicarb gtt for treatment of metabolic acidosis.
She also become hypotensive at OSH and was started on neo and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Also during admission at OSH patient found to have 7mm left posterior parietal hemorrhage on head CT without mass effect.
She was seen by neurosurgery at OSH who felt hemorrhage unlikely after repeat head CT showed no change in mass.
Patient also noted to have severe sinusitis.

FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    No Virus isolated so far.
Right upper lobe consolidation, likely pneumonia.
Moderate interstitial abnormality is likely pulmonary edema, though viral pneumonia is also possible.
Possible mediastinal lymphadenopathy - recommend Chest CT for further evaluation on a nonemergent basis.
Abnormal FLAIR sulcal hyperintensity , differential includes any leptomeningeal process.
A 6 mm lesion within the left occipital cortex, which may represent a meningioma, but is incompletely characterized.
A hemorrhage in this area is not entirely excluded, and short interval followup with non-contrast CT was recommended.
There has been mild interval worsening of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
Right upper lobe consolidation is stable.
Ill-defined right lower lobe perihilar opacity is new.
This could be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema, but infection cannot be completely excluded.
[**2125-2-12**] SPINAL FLUID: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
[**2125-2-13**] CXR: Mild improvement in the degree of pulmonary edema as well as the previously noted right upper and lower lung field consolidations.
[**2125-2-13**] EEG: This is an abnormal EEG due to the right greater than left central sharp waves, the bursts of generalized slowing and the slow and disorganized background rhythm.
The first two abnormalities suggest dysfunction of deep subcortical midline structures, while the slow background suggests a mild to moderate encephalopathy.
An encephalopathic picture may result from infections, toxic metabolic abnormalities or medication effect.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Diffuse mild interstitial abnormality has improved since [**2-12**], [**2124**].
Right upper lung consolidation is increasing.
[**2125-2-16**] UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT: No evidence for DVT.
No intra-abdominal source of fever identified.
Diffuse anasarca with interval increase in small amount of simple free fluid noted within the cul- de- sac.
Mild stranding/wall thickening of the distal rectum/anus consistent with known history of anal carcinoma.
Wall thickening may also be related to post- radiation changes in correct clinical setting.
Marked improvement in multifocal pneumonia with interval appearance of small simple right pleural effusion.
Incidental note is also made of a mucous-filled left lower lobe bronchus.
Findings suggestive underlying renal dysfunction may be due to HIV nephropathy.
No significant change from most recent CT examination; however, current examination is limited due to motion artifact.
Stable appearance to opacification of sphenoid sinus with mild improvement to opacification within the ethmoid air cells.
If high clinical suspicion for sinus disease as a source of fever, may be better evaluated with dedicated sinus CT. .
[**2125-2-18**] CXR: Improvement in the appearance of the interstitial process together with the right upper lobe airspace disease since the prior examination.
Bronchoscopy here with sputum negative for PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 11381**] negative x 3, urine legionella antigen negative, and viral screen negative.
Swallow evaluation was done during her admission due to her poor mental status and showed no evidence of aspiration.
# Drug fever:  At the end of patient's course of antibiotics for her pneumonia, she began to have fevers as high as 103 but was also noted to have developed a rash.
Work-up was otherwise negative, including CT abd, CT head to reevaluate for progressive sinusitis, and repeat cultures.
# Abnormal MRI:  MRI done for altered mental status while in the ICU showed an abnormal FLAIR sulcal hyperintensity and an occipital density, thought to be a meningioma.
They suspect the occipital lesion is a meningioma given it is stable compared to a prior MRI in [**7-26**].
As for the meningeal enhancement, concern raised for possible CNS lymphoma.
Patient found to have EBV in her CSF with rare atypical cells on cytology.
# Acute renal failure:  Renal followed along.
Suspect acute tubular necrosis.
She had no severe electrolyte disturbances.
At discharge, given persistent renal dysfunction and complaints of diarrhea on kaletra, her HAART regimen was adjusted.
She did require nystatin for oropharyngeal +/- esophageal candidiasis.
# Neutropenia:  Suspect medication-induced given onset during her stay.
Following the discontinuation of all antibiotics, ANC recovered and patient no longer neutropenic at the time of discharge.
High ferritin suggests anemia of chronic disease.
Certainly renal failure will be a contributing factor.
# Altered mental status:  Likely due to residual effects of sedating meds administered while intubated.
EEG showed no evidence for seizures.
