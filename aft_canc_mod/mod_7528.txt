History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 90095**] is a 63-year-old gentleman with Hep-C cirrhosis and multifocal HCC.
He is status post a right lobe TACE on [**2145-5-29**] followed by RFA to a segment II/III lesion on [**2145-8-4**].
A left lobe TACE was subsequently performed on [**2145-8-6**] for residual disease.
The patient has portal vein infiltration from his HCC and known portal hypertension evidenced by Grade I esophageal varices seen on recent EGD.
The patient was in his normal state of health until Saturday when he had increasing pain in his midepigastric area.
He described the pain as sharp, radiated to the back, and was worse with deep breaths, and with laying on his left side.
He had some relief with dilaudid, but he says that the pain was worse and different than his normal RUQ pain.
The pain was not associated with eating, nor did he describe it as reflux pain.
The patient says that the pain continued until Sunday when he felt a "popping" sensation in the same distribution as the pain.
He said that the pain actually improved then, but then on Monday he developed dark, black, tarry stool.
The patient continued to have black, tarry, large quantity stools on Wednesday, but then the patient's stools returned to a brown color.
He is not on prophylactic nadalol or propranolol.
The patient was admitted directly from clinic to the MICU for urgent EGD for possible variceal bleed.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was afebrile with normal BP, HR.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: Mr. [**Known lastname 90095**] is a 63-year-old man with cirrhosis who was found to have multiple liver lesions suspicious for HCC on screening ultrasound [**2145-4-9**].
MRI [**2145-4-16**] demonstrated a cirrhotic liver with a 4.2 cm mass in segment II and a bilobed 5.5 cm mass in segment VIII.
His post Tace course was notable for fever, significant and prolonged RUQ pain, mild nausea, urinary retention and constipation in the setting of  narcotics to treat his pain.
The patient underwent RFA to a segment II/III lesion on [**2145-8-4**].
Imaging was notable for a previously noted right adrenal nodule which was shown to have increased in size to 25 x 15 mm, suspicious for metastasis.
Notation was also made of interval increase in size of remaining foci of arterial enhancing lesions within the liver.
Following TACE, the patient will be set up for bx and RFA of his adrenal nodule.
He had discomfort at the end of the procedure (he has previously had epigastric and left shoulder pain related to his RF and RUQ and right shoulder pain from his TACE - both of these might be expected post-procedure).
He got Versed/Fentanyl for moderate sedation, Toradol during the case, and had significant nausea at the end of the procedure for which he got additional Zofran and a dose of Haldol.
He received Diludid PCA complicated by constipation and nausea.
- hx of IV drug abuse - cirrhosis (bx performed during cholecystectomy in early [**2133**] b/c of abnormal liver findings) Presumed [**12-30**] Hep C 3a, viral load > 1 million [**2145-2-26**].
Treated with interferon x 4 doses in [**2141**] without response.

- Hep C 3a positive, viral load > 1 million [**3-9**]  Social History: (As per previous notes).
