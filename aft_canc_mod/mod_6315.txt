During her last hospitalization she was found to have a pericardial effusion with evidence of  tamponade and this was drained.
She was also noted to have a large mediastinal mass and diffuse lymphadenopathy.
Pericardial fluid and lymph node FNA both did not show clear evidence of malignancy.
She was discharged to her group home acute care facility and recommended to have entire excision of her egg-sized left axillary lymph node for further diagnosis.
She now represents with tachypnea and increased oxygen requirement.
At her home she was noted to be more tachypnic with slightly increased O2 requirement.
The patient has history of tachypnea during her last hospitalization that resolved with sitting up (may have been mechanical from her large abdomen/ileus) and with nebulizer treatments.
CTA chest showed no evidence of PE, small bilateral pleural effusion, moderate pericardial effusion and large mediastinal mass encasing and narrowing the SVC, extensive lymphadenopathy.
When asked if she has pain, she does point to her distended abdomen and to her chest.

However, there is now marked bowel wall edema, and surrounding inflammatory stranding in the region of the rectum and sigmoid colon.
This extends roughly to the region of apparent surgical anastomosis in the left lower quadrant.
Uterus is unchanged, with small focal hyperattenuating focus anteriorly, which is unchanged, and may represent a small exophytic fibroid.
Diffuse anasarca is unchanged.
There is no osseous lesion suspicious for malignancy.
Worsening of severe bowel wall thickening and inflammatory stranding in the rectum and sigmoid colon, most consistent with colitis, presumably related to the patient's known C. difficile infection.

Brief Hospital Course: 59yoF with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple medical problems including mental retardation, PAF with RVR, and chronic ileus.
She suffered from recurrent cardiac tamponade with hemodynamic compromise recurrently during her long hospitalization, ultimately requiring placement of a pericardial window into the L pleural space.
Because of her ongoing problems with ileus she was placed on TPN.
HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA: patient has nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma with a mediastinal mass with extensive disease causing compression of her L main stem bronchus, bilateral pulmonary arteries and of her SVC (no evidence of SVC syndrome).
Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's, at least stage 2b.
She underwent urgent treatment with EACOP (no bleomycin due to low pulmonary reserve and no vincristine due to GI toxicity in a patient w/ paralytic ileus).
No evidence of tumor lysis.
Patient became neutropenic on [**7-30**] and was restarted on G-CSF for remaining two days of therapy.
Due to decreasing concern for gram positive infection, Vancomycin was D/C'ed with last dose being on [**8-2**].
Patient was afebrile from [**8-1**] until transfer out of the ICU on [**8-7**].At time of transfer out of the ICU, patient's blood culture results were all pending (and showing NGTD) aside from GNR growth on [**7-31**].
Upper lip ulcer was screened for HSV on [**8-5**] and proved positive by DFA.
However, on the night of [**2144-8-23**] the pt developed hypotension and was found to be in Afib with RVR again.
Her pulsus was recorded as 4 but she did have pulmonary congestion and distended neck veins.
On [**8-24**], cardiac surgery was urgently consulted following the echo that revealed significant pericardial effusion and right ventricular collapse.
She tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
For further surgical details, please see separate dictated operative note.
She was maintained on Amiodarone and beta blockade for intermittent atrial fibrillation.
A rectal tube was placed on [**2144-9-5**] to help keep her sacral area dry and clean and assist wound healing.
She had a CT scan on [**9-8**] of her torso that showed only mild improvement in her lymphoma after chemo therapy.
During her ICE treatment she became febrile on Day 3, but they was afebrile till discharge.
She also had a decrease in the number of bowel movements, which increased in number again once her treatment was complete.
TACHYPNEA AND HYPOXIA:  Found on chest CT to have tumor causing compression not only of her SVC but also of her pulmonary arteries bilaterally which would cause the same V/Q mismatch as a PE would by decreasing her perfusion.
In addition she was fluid overloaded and had bilateral pleural effusions and had tumor compression of her L main stem bronchus.
Treatment was directed towards the underlying cause, she received chemotherapy for her Hodgkin's lymphoma as above and underwent a R sided thoracentesis 1.1 liters removed.
TACHYCARDIA: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with RVR with rate as high as 190s to low 200s; however, she was normotensive with these rates.
Treated initially with a dilt and esmolol drip; subsequently she was loaded with IV amiodarone and dilt drip was discontinued, her atrial fibrillation reverted to sinus rhythm and the IV amiodarone was stopped.
She was transitioned to po Lopressor 12.5mg tid, which was uptitrated to 25mg TID due to persistent and intermittent RVR.
She still has occasional very short self limited episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
CTA negative for PE but a fib with RVR more frequent and more difficult to control prior to chemotherapy and may have been due to pulmonary artery compression causing physiology similar to PE.
She then developed afib during her first neutropenic fever on [**7-31**] to rates in the low 200s, reduced only to the 150s with 3 doses of 10mg IV diltiazem.
She was mentating at her baseline and with minimal oxygen requirement throughout her RVR while on the medicine floor.
On transfer to the ICU the pt received 1L NS in setting of on-going diarrhea.
She converted to NSR spontaneous with IVF resuscitation.
She was started on an amiodarone gtt with the hope of maintaining NSR however she developed bradycardia with the IV infusion and it was stopped.
In brief, at that time she became hypotensive and tachycardia and was found to have Afib with RVR as well as cardiac tamponade.
Her last EKG before discharge showed mild tachycardia but sinus rhythm.
ILEUS AND ABDOMINAL DISTENTION: Patient has a history of recurrent ileus.
Upon admission to the ICU on [**7-31**], the patient displayed a soft and non-tender abdomen.
The enlarged bowel segment was originally thought to be colon and typhlitis became of concern; however, review of CT scan on [**8-2**] revealed that distention was more related to gastric distention than colonic distention.
Abdominal distention was markedly improved, but still present at time of patient transfer from ICU on [**8-7**].
She was initially eating well, but developed abdominal distension with diarrhea.
GI did not recommend a endoscopy at this time, but may pursue it in the future when her infection has been treated.
Her ileus has been previously relieved with repositioning the patient and then rectal tube placement for a short time.
R UPPER LIMB THOMBUS - patient assessed on floor and noted to have swelling around the PICC; DVT found by US.
US on [**8-31**] showed superficial thrombus.
However, given her many risk factors for DVT she was maintained on PPx dose of heparin SC.
C. DIFF: Pt was noted to have diarrhea with leukocytosis on [**2144-8-8**].
She was found to be C diff toxin positive and started on metronidazole on [**2144-8-9**].
Her leukocytosis resolved within days of treatment but her diarrhea continued.
Her stools are still intermittently a bloody jelly consistency (likely shedding of pseudomembrane), however, the volume and number of stools have improved on this treatment, until after her ICE treatment finished, at which time the number of loose stools increased again.
SKIN BREAKDOWN: Pt has suffered from worsening skin breakdown throughout her admission complicated by persistent diarrhea.
To assist in healing of her sacral ulcer a rectal tube was placed on [**2144-9-5**].
Her calf ulcers and rashes have not recurred now that she is not on pneumoboots.
She still has a perineal ulcer for which she needs wound care, but her sore on her hip has improved.
She was initially started on amoxicillin for 1 day, then when sensitives returned was stated on linezolid for VRE infection.
She then had another urine culture showing a UTI with E. coli and she was started on ceftriaxone.
DM: Patient is a type II diabetic and on SSI.
After her TPN was stopped she had one episode of hypoglycemia with BG of 47, which was increased to 147 after a [**2-12**] amp of dextrose.
In the past two days she has been having a decrease in her Hct, was 22.3 yesterday and had 1 unit of RBCs, was 21.6 today and received 2 units of rbcs.
She had guaiac neg stools today and yesterday.
Camphor-Menthol 0.5-0.5 % Lotion Sig: One (1) Appl Topical QID (4 times a day) as needed for itching.
