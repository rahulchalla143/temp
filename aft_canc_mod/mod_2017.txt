Back mild tenderness at upper T spine.
Chest x-ray lateral right sided effusion, no fractures, no pneumothorax.

Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm no acute ST or T wave changes.
IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 76 year-old male status post fall from standing position, bifrontal subarachnoid hemorrhages and loculated lateral right sided pulmonary effusion without definite rib fracture.
Initially obtained a syncope workup.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  syncope:  The patient's syncope was felt to be due to symptomatic bradycardia, which was treated with a DDD pacemaker, which was implanted on [**2138-10-24**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 1911**] without complications.
Neurosurgery evaluation for the subarachnoid hemorrhage felt that the bleeds were stable and would not be amenable to surgical intervention and were not operated upon.
Pulmonary:  Right loculated pleural effusion was drained by ultrasound guided thoracentesis, which drained serosanguinous fluid, which showed exudates with no evidence of empyema, no organisms grew and cytology was negative.
This finding was consistent with prior films obtained from the VA, which showed that the pleural effusion has been present for at least the last three to four months without change.
Right loculated pleural effusion.
