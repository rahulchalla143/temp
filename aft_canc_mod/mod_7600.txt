Found on hospital work-up to have multiple lung masses, and 3 by 4 cm mass in right cerebellum.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right hemiarthroplasty Placement of R IVC filter Bronchoscopy, 4 samples taken Hemicraniotomy, for resection of cerebellar mass  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 year old woman with a medical history of tobacco abuse, diabetes, hypertension who presents from home, initially to OSH after mechanical fall this morning.
She denies LOC or amnesia about event.
She noted pain in her right hip and difficulty ambulating so called ambulance.
She was brought to outside hospital and was found to have right hip and femur fracture on imaging.
A head CT was obtained, which showed cerebellar mass with mild hydrocephalus.
MRI confirmed right cerebellar lesion with rim enhancement suggesting metastatic focus.
CXR showed right upper lobe mass like opacity.
Exam notable for normal mental status, mild R-sided dysmetria.

CT HEAD: mass lesion within right cerebellar hemisphere with adjacent mass effect and compression of 4th ventricle.
Evidence of mild non-communicating hydrocephalus.
MRI BRAIN: right cerebellar lesion with rim enhancement suggesting metastatic focus, creates a degree of compression upon medulla and pons, no other abdnormal gadolium enhancing foci are seen .
IP bronch: Abnormal mucosa in the upper airways.
Abnormal bronchial mucosa in the bronchial tree compatible with tumor infiltration.
Otherwise normal to tracheobronchial tree  [**12-20**] Head CT: Expected post operative change without acute hemorrhage or overt mass effect.
[**12-21**] Brain MRI: Postoperative changes in the right cerebellum with hemorrhage in the operative bed precluding evaluation for residual neoplasm.
Restricted diffusion in the right lateral cerebellum lateral to the operative cavity suggesting acute ischemia.
Brief Hospital Course: MEDICAL HOSPITAL COURSE:  #METASTATIC CARCINOMA: Initially presented with fall, found to have cerebellar lesion on CT head and multiple lung lesions on chest CT, so was thought to have primary lung lesion with mets.
Lung lesion biopsied with bronchoscopy on [**12-17**] and showed adenocarcinoma on pathology.
CT abd pelvis showed lesions in kidney and liver, however both benign on further evaluation with u/s.
Hip fx was repaired, as below, and neuro-oncology was consulted for cerebellar mass, below.
Thought to be most likely metastasis from unknown primary and likely contributed to unsteadiness leading to fall.
Did not recommend anti-epileptics or other interventions.
On [**12-20**], after tissue diagnosis of adenocarcinoma made, patient was taken to OR for resection of mass and hemicraniotomy and transferred to neurosurgical service.
Surger was performed without complication.
Post operative head CT revealed no hemorrhage.
On [**12-21**] the patient was neurologically intact except for right dysmetria.
Her pain was controlled.
#HIP FRACTURE/DVT PROPHYLAXIS: Patient was s/p mechanical fall with right displaced femoral neck fracture, likely in the setting of unsteadiness considering her cerebellar lesion.
Initially surgery was delayed for one day because of concerns for starting anticoagulation with lovenox in setting of cerebellar mass with risk of possible hemorrhage, also with discussion of possible shunt.
Pt tolerated procedure without complications on [**12-14**], bone was biopsied for concern for pathologic fx, and pathology negative for malignancy.
# LEUKOCYTOSIS: Most likely secondary to trauma or margination from recent steroid administration.
There are no focal signs of infection.
She has a CXR with opacity but no respiratory sx to suggest infection.
#DIABETES: Patient's home glipizide and metformin were held, patient started on ISS and lantus regimen, and was adjusted to include prandial insulin.
Disp:*2 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Adenocarcinoma of the Lung Metastatic Brain mass R Hip Fracture   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
?Please return to the office in [**6-2**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and/or a wound check.
