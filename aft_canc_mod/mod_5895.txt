Mildly dilated esophagus.
This probably relates to the patient's underlying history of multiple sclerosis.
Dilatation of the distal ureters bilaterally.
Dilated distal ureters enter the bladder normally without stones or evidence of distal obstruction.
Along with bladder wall thickening, this finding likely relates to the patient's known history of self catheterization for bladder spasticity secondary to multiple sclerosis.
head ct: There is no intra-axial or extra-axial hemorrhage identified.
There is no mass effect or shift of the normally midline structures.
[**Doctor Last Name **] and white matter differentation is preserved.
No major vascular territorial infarction is seen.
Bone windows show no suspicious lesions.
Mucosal thickening is seen in the ethmoid air cells.
CXR on admission- normal   Brief Hospital Course: Pt admitted to MICU intubated due to concern for his airway in setting of change in mental status.
He had one other episode of fluid responsive hypotension during his stay likely from hypovolemia from diarrhea.
HTN: Initially his bp medications were held because of his hypotension and for concern for sepsis.
ARF: He had pre-renal acute renal failure from dehydration.
A CT scan of his head did not reveal an acute process.
CAD: He was admitted with an elevated troponin in the setting of hypotension.
He did complain of a mild pleuritic chest pain that resolved quickly on its own.
An echocardiogram did not reveal wall motion abnormailty, however the windows were poor.
He had another episode of chest/abd pain that appeared to be similar to his chronic "gas" pain.
He was monitored for ischemia again but did not have an increase in cardiac enymes or ekg changes.
He had a recent egd with a gastric bezoar that was broken up by the scope.
On the day of admission, he had been scheduled for an upper gi series.
Pt still complains of symptoms of fullness and pain.
He will need an outpatient colonoscopy given his age and family h/o colon cancer.
Reglan discontinued and received upper gi series and small bowel follow-through demonstrating- normal transit time and normal terminal ileum.
The upper tract view was some what limitied due to patient's difficulty with movement.
His concern is for discomfort and I recommended lidocaine gel.
Once this pain resolves, his foley should be removed and replaced with intermittent catheterization.
Diarrhea:  He was recently admitted with diarrhea, hypotension and hypovolemia [**8-6**].
FEN: Low residual cardiac diet.
At rehab he should receive ivfs as needed until has good po intake and while diarrhea continues.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: acute renal failure from hypovolemia klebsiella urinary tract infection hypertension hypotension from hypovolemia secondary to poor po intake and diarrhea altered mental status c. difficile colitis pseudogout multiple sclerosis elevated troponin   Discharge Condition: on room air, unable to self catheterize, decreased upper extremity strength, with minimal diarrhea, picc in place, creatinine 1.0, afebrile  Discharge Instructions: Take medications as prescribed.
