The patient said she was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**12-13**] for respiratory failure in the setting of a multifocal PNA, during that time she was Patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics (initially Vanc/zosyn/levoflox/tobramycin/tamiflu-->subsequently Naf/Cipro/zosyn/Azithro then Naf/Vanc/Cipro/Azithro); her final antibiotic regimen includes VANCOMYCIN and CEFEPIME.

One brother with history of testicular cancer.
neck supple, old tracheotomy site closed, no surrounding erythema or tenderness at site.
Pulm: Pt has bubbling/whistling sounds at the bases bilaterally, otherwise lung fields clear to ausculatation bilaterally, diagonal surgical scar at upper portion of left posterior lung field Abd: G-tube in place c/d/i, no surrounding erythema or tenderness, soft, NT, +BS.
Midline surgical scar and punctate scar just to the left of midline.
neck supple, old tracheotomy site closed, mild pink erythema, no tenderness at site.
Pulm: Pt has bubbling/whistling sounds at the right base, otherwise lung fields clear to ausculatation bilaterally, diagonal surgical scar at upper portion of left posterior lung field Abd: G-tube in place c/d/i, no surrounding erythema or tenderness, soft, NT, +BS.
Midline surgical scar and punctate scar just to the left of midline.
CXR [**2183-1-18**] There is no new, focal area of parenchymal consolidation.
Prominence of the pulmonary interstitium and a focal area of consolidation near the right lung apex persists.
The right hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated as before, and there is right apical capping unchanged.
IMPRESSION: No acute change.
At the right lung base, there is an unchanged scar after VATS.
No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
No pneumothorax.
No other abnormalities .
Partial collapse of the right upper lobe is unchanged.
Decreased heterogeneous opacification of the right middle and lower lung is a combination of decreased right pleural effusion and improved pulmonary edema or atelectasis.
Fluid in the pleural space at the right apex is unchanged.
Prominence of the right paratracheal mediastinum is engorgement of the mediastinal vasculature.
There is no pneumothorax.
Barium passed freely through the oropharynx without evidence of obstruction.
Penetration of thin liquids and nectar was seen with trace aspiration of thin liquids.
IMPRESSION: Penetration of thin liquids and nectar consistencies with trace aspiration of thin liquids.
There was initial concern for infection given her leukocytosis, worsening dyspnea and CXR findings.
Interventional pulmonology did bedside ultrasound to see if her pleural effusion should be tapped, however her pleural effusions were not large enough to tap.
# Abdominal pain.
Patient has been complaining of irritation at G-tube site that had been controlled with dilaudid at outside facility.
Per recent progress notes, pain has been positional, more when leaning on left side.
US on [**2182-12-31**] for this pain showed no evidence of ascites or fluid collection at site of tube placement.
Seen by IR for evaluation of PEG tube, they found no problems with the tube.
The pain persisted and she thought that it was secondary to the buttons around the tube site.
The patient's abdominal pain around the tube site should be re-evaluated in the outpatient setting.
Small brown BM on arrival, no melena.
However, was noted to be guaiac positive on/off during last admission with no clear source found.
No evidence of active bleeding.
# Diarrhea: Found to be C. difficile positive on [**2182-1-19**] and started on Flagyl.
Pt also has radiation enteritis and had been having recurrent diarrhea and weight loss likely secondary to exacerbation of enteritis vs. change in diet with recent introduction of TF.
Her diarrhea never truly resolved and it is likely due to in part her resolving infection vs. her underlying radiation enteritis.
She has chronic issues with diarrhea and they have been adjusting her tube feeds to manage this issue.
She will be followed by GI and nutrition for these problems.
# Pulmonary fibrosis s/p LLL lung transplant: pt has long history of fibrotic lung disease s/p left lower lobe transplant and multiple stents placed to left mainstem bronchus that have required frequent degranulation cleaning.
# Swallow: Pt having difficulty swallowing in outpatient setting and was initially  NPO getting all nutrition via her G-tube.
History of esophageal stricture with mid-esophageal stents placed.
Upon further evaluation speech and swallow bedside evaluation showed significant improvement, but video swallow showed she could not tolerate even a pureed liquids.
After the video swallow, speech and swallow recommended tube feeds for the majority of her nutrition with nectar thickened liquids in very small amounts (4oz max).

You were admitted to the hospital from Rehab because you had increased loose stools and abdominal cramping.
While you were here stool cultures were sent to look for infection and they came back positive for c. dificile.
This continued into the following day and as a result your blood pressures were doing better, but you started to have difficulty breathing.
You were doing better, your blood pressure was stable and so you were transferred back to the floor and eventually you were breathing well without the nasal cannula.
Speech and swallow evaluated you at the bedside as well as with a video swallow study and felt that there was not much change in your swallowing function.
They did not feel that the buttons were causing the pain and they thought they would fall off since they were put in with absorbable sutures.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR SWALLOWING NECTAR THICKENED LIQUIDS: Also nectar thickened pureed solids.
