Mrs. [**Known lastname 35087**] was diagnosed with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] after presenting with diplopia on [**2106-4-3**].
She was found to have positive Ach-R Abs.
She was admitted to the Neurology service from [**4-10**] with complaints of shortness of breath as well as left lid droop.
It was felt that her shortness of breath was likely due to anxiety rather than myasthenia and she was started on Paxil.
At that time, NIFs and vital capacity were normal and she had no other fatiguable weakness besides the ocular symptoms.
She was also found to have a thymoma at that time.
She also noted that for the past week or so prior to presentation, she has experienced noticeable dyspnea on exertion.
For the past two days prior to presentation, she said that she has had difficulty holding her head up straight.
She tried to lay down to rest early in the evening, and said that not only did she have difficulty breathing, but she was having difficulty clearing the saliva from her throat.
She said that at present, her swallowing is normal.
She has not noticed any recent difficulty with chewing or speaking.

New moderate bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 35087**] is a 53 year-old woman with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] who presented with myasthenic crisis.
She has had a progressively worsening course since diagnosis in late [**Month (only) 547**], though it is possible that this exacerbation was secondary to a urinary tract infection.
She was electively intubated for airway protection as respiratory failure was deemed imminent given her examination and respiratory mechanics.
1. myasthenia crisis: After admission to the ICU, a plasmapheresis catheter was placed and plasma exchange was initiated on [**4-30**].
At the end of her first session of plasmapheresis she had an episode of sepsis (see below) and a subsequent deterioration in her strength.
On day of discharge she had fatiguable ptosis, R > L, diplopia with R gaze and with 10 seconds of sustained upgaze, incomplete abduction her R eye with R gaze, EOM otherwise intact in horizontal plane, and limited upgaze L > R.  She had 4+/5 strength in her neck flexors and 5-/5 in neck extensors, 4+/5 strength in her R deltoid, 4+/5 R finger extensors, and otherwise full strength throughout.
2. ventilator dependence: Ms. [**Known lastname 35087**] failed spontaneous breathing trials after her first plasmapheresis sessions.
She then developed a ventilator-associated pneumonia (see below).
She developed another UTI on [**5-9**], but at that time was also found to have a pneumonia.
These eventually grew staph aureus.
She was treated with vancomycin and meropenem, changed to nafcillin and meropenem after sputum cultures grew methacillin-sensitive staph aureus.
She finished a course of Nafcillin and Meropenem, and had no further fevers or leukocytosis.
4. septic shock: On [**5-11**], she became hypotensive.
5. hyperglycemia: As the prednisone was increased, she had elevated blood sugars.
6. mild ARF: She had mild elevations in her creatinine after she became hypotensive from sepsis; she was treated with IV fluids and lasix was held with resolution of the ARF.
Iron studies were consistent with iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic inflammation.
