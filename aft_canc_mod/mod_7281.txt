Admission Date:  [**2166-2-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-2-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2090-6-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12**] Chief Complaint: Weakness, fatigue  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: endotracheal intubation  History of Present Illness: 75 yo woman with polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], melanoma, prior DVT here with progressive weakness and fatigue, no other focal complaints .
Pt was seen in ED [**1-13**] for abdominal pain where RUQ u/s showed gallstones without evidence of cholecystitis.
Since that time, she has had progressive weakness and fatigue and has undergone extensive outpatient workup including labs, echo, ct of chest, abd, pelvis to assess the concerns of recurrent melenoma.
Patient reports weakness has been progressing slowly, but is now at a point where she can no longer walk without assistance of her husband.
She reports decreased PO intake over the past week, no POs today as she has "no appetite", feeling "dry", and having a nosebleed this morning.
She has not noticed any blood in her bowel movements, denies any f/c/n/v, cp, palpitations, falls, cough, visual changes, mental status changes, confusion, headache, dysuria.
She has noted increasing bilateral edema over the past week.
Abdominal pain largely resolved unless abdomen is palpated.
Repeat screening colonoscopy [**2165-8-21**] showed a hyperplastic polyp.
(3) Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].
(5) s/p wide excision of in-situ melanoma associated with her invasive stage IIB melanoma of the left leg.
declined interferon-alfa (IFA) for adjuvant therapy of her melanoma (6) DVT in the past.
3+ times,no history of arterial thrombosis.
Status post total abdominal hysterectomy for fibroids.
No EtOH, no Tob.
Physical Exam: T 97, HR 100, BP 151/57, RR 24 93% on RA, 97% on 2L Gen: elderly, weak appearing, speaking in soft voice, pleasant, appears mildly short of breath HEENT: dried blood noted around nares, conjunctiva pale, no scleral icterus, OP DRY, no OP erythema, PRRL, EOMI, no LAD CV: tachy, regular, no murmers noted, carotids without bruit Pulm: CTA, but decreased BS at bases Abd; abdominal scars noted.
NABS, slight pain to palp RUQ, no r/g, no peritoneal signs, non-distended, Guiac: per ED Negative brown stool Ext: 2+ edema bilaterally to shins, feet cool to touch, no skin breakdown Neuro: CN intact, grip and dorsi/plantar felxion [**5-22**], patient having some trouble lifting legs of bed with resistence.
2+ plantar reflexes .
EKG:  NSR, 100,nl axis, PR prolonged  250ms (unchanged from prior in [**2164**]), no st changes.
[**2-5**]: RUQ US: Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Small right pleural effusion.
[**2166-1-28**] CT chest, abd, pelvis: At least three tiny noncalcified pulmonary nodules within the right middle lobe.
; Dense coronary artery calcifications; Small bilateral pleural effusions; Splenomegaly; ) Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis; Small amount of free fluid within the pelvis.
increased free fluid in abd.
and pelvis, and bilat pleural effusions and subcutaneous tissue.. .
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There was great concern for bleed with elevated INR, but CT showed no evidence of RP bleed.
Lab tests did not show any indication of mircoangiopatic hemolytic anemia on peripheral smear, nor was there any evidence of DIC.
Hematocrit remained fairly stable, however, the elavated LDH and concurrent lactic acidosis was thought to be secondary to the rapid cell turnover.
Thrombocytopenia/left shift: Platelet count low with concerning etiology of infection vs. malignancy.
Peripheral smear "toxic" appearing but left shift resolving.
No evidence of bleed on CT. Guiac negative in ED.
Patient has had elevated glucose since [**Month (only) 1096**], elevated now with decreased PO intake, however serum acetone was negative.
Appeared to be lactic acidosis and probable renal failure contributing.
IN the MICU, pt continued to have high Lactate, with noted consolidation on CXR.
Respiratory failure secondary to hypoxia.
Pt became rapidly tachypnic and dyspnic on the floor, and was intubated secondary to respiratory failure.
Acute process most likely secondary to intravascular volume depletion in the setting of volume overload.
Tachypnea: likely from anemia and a respiratory compensation to metabolic acidosis.
Edema/anasarca: Bilat leg edema worsening over hospital course was not likely  consistent with bilat DVT, but given hx may consider LENIs.
CT showed increase size in pleural effusions, subcutaneous edema, free abdominal fluid and a new pericardial effusion that was not seen on [**1-31**].
There was Concern for malignancy though no mass noted on CT scans.
Elevated blood glucose.
