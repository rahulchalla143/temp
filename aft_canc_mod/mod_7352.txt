The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No intraluminal thrombus is identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
AP PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is a metallic tracheostomy tube.
There are bilateral lower lobe opacities There are bilateral interstitial opacities with perihilar fullness.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Perihilar fullness and interstitial opacities consistent with volume overload/CHF pattern.
Bilateral lower lobe opacities are also present and superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded.
woman with unwitnessed loss of consciousness and evidence of ?PNA vs. CHF on CXR.
* SYNCOPAL EVENT: The patient's loss of consciousness was attributed to a hypoxic event from a mucus plug.
No V/Q was done because her CXR was poor quality because of the finding of consolidation vs atelectasis.
CTA was not obtained because the patient has renal failure and PE was not high on the differential.
Her failure was thought to be secondary to aspiration vs. mucus plug in setting of increased secretions likely [**2-23**] pna.
She has no teeth so less likely to have anaerobes.
She also is at risk of post obstructive PNA as she's had lung CA and had bronchial stents placed.
LENI's were negative for DVT making PE less likely.
* COPD: The patient had wheezes on exam and evidence of infection.
* H/O TRACHEOBRONCHOMALACIA: pt was scheduled to have an outpt bronchoscopy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] today (Mon [**3-27**]) for routine followup of stents.
* PAIN CONTROL: Continued on MS contin and percocet for home pain control.
* ANEMIA: Pt has low Hct at baseline likely due to anemia of chronic disease.
Iron studies did not show iron, B12, or folate deficiency * DISPO: The patient was discharged home with close follow up.
