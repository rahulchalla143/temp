Washout and takedown and resection of failed ileocolic     anastomosis with end ileostomy.
History of Present Illness: This patient is a 79-year-old male who presents with a history of having anemia which was worked up and he was found to have a tumor in cecum very near the ileocecal valve.
This did require extensive enterolysis for approximately an hour and half because of his previous abdominal sepsis following coronary artery bypass graft in [**2093**].
He was doing well until yesterday when he developed a white count and a fever overnight.
He was brought to surgery and there he was found to have fecal peritonitis.
This was accomplished with some degree of difficulty because he had had a preperitoneal bleed, I assume from closure, so we had some abdominal wall hematoma, as well, which was removed.

At the right upper lobe laterally, there is some linear reticular markings and a nodular feature is appreciated projecting over right anterior rib 3.
The latter was shown to be a dense calcification on prior chest CT. That CT shows no definite correlate with the reticular markings visualized at the right upper lobe laterally, but additional reticular markings were seen in the right upper lobe anteriorly.
There is no focal consolidation.
No pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No focal consolidation.
Dense calcification presumably granuloma in the superior aspect of the right lower lobe laterally.
