for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, COPD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for 2 days of worsening dyspnea.
Pt denies chest pain, fevers.
He was a little nauseous, no vomiting.
He was found to have parainfluenza type 3 and NSTEMI v. demand ischemia.
ECHO had shown newly depressed LVEF of 30-35% with akinesis of the apex and distal LV.
This was felt to be c/w Takosubo's cardiomyopathy.
He was also ruled out for PE with chest CTA.
for diminished breath sounds bilaterally.
CXR was red as no infiltrates, no CHF.
for bibasilar rales, expir wheezes, and 1+ pitting pedal edema.
Has been having orthopnea, DOE, and increased ankle edema.
Reports feeling SOB and wheezy at home.
Denies cough and sputum.
High-grade diffuse large B-cell cardiac lymphoma, presenting with R atrial mass, now s/p R-[**Hospital1 **] with prophylactic intrathecal MTX (last dose was from [**Date range (3) 107340**], cycle 4).
6. h/o DVT s/p IVC filter placement on [**1-27**] 7.
CAD s/p silent MI in [**7-29**] 6.
History of rib fracture.
He underwent biopsy of this on [**2200-1-3**], and pathology showed high-grade aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, staining positive for CD20, bcl-2, and bcl-6 in a small subset.
Bcl-2 co-expression and lack of CD10 argued against Burkitt's lymphoma; however, FISH studies were positive for c-myc rearrangement.
He was diagnosed with high-grade cardiac lymphoma on the spectrum of diffuse large B-cell to Burkitt's lymphoma.
No other sites of disease were identified by torso CT and bone marrow biopsy.
Treatment course has been complicated by a DVT status post IVC filter in [**1-/2200**] and pneumonia requiring intubation for hypoxia in [**2-27**].

Otherwise, the lungs are clear with no signs of pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
No evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**11-22**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No pulmonary embolism.
New small consolidation at right lung base may represent pneumonic consolidation or, in the setting of airway secretions, aspiration.
Perhaps slight decrease in size of cardiac mass compared to CT from [**2200-3-26**], with persistent mass effect on superior vena cava.
No change in size of right adrenal mass and right lower lobe lung nodule.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia at 105 bpm.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
for diffuse large B-cell cardiac lymphoma, COPD, and recent diagnosis of parainfluenza type 3 and NSTEMI v demand ischemia who was transferred from [**Hospital1 5979**] for 2 days of worsening dyspnea.
Pt has known diagnosis of parainfluenza type 3, likely exacerbating his COPD.
In addition, he likely had a component of acute on chronic CHF given sxs of orthopnea, increasing pedal edema, and elevated BNP.
Repeat ECHO actually showed resolution of Takosubo physiology with improvement in patient's LVEF.
On CXR there was no evidence of new infiltrate however due to symptoms of productive cough he was started on treatment for HAP with vanco/zosyn.
Blood and sputum cutlure showed no growth.
He was given incentive spirometer for atelectasis.
# Hypotension: On the floor, pt became hypotensive and was given IVF and 1 unit of PRBCs and transfered back to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
It was thought that his hypotension was possible secondary to rapid diuresis.
Leukocytosis: The patient complained of cough and had a possible infiltrate on CXR.
However, WBC remained elevated and was treated with abx for HAP.
Coronary artery disease: Pt had NSTEMI v. demand ischemia on last hospitalization with transient apical akinesis.
Pt denied any chest pain.
Per his Cardiologist, given his underlying comorbities, they felt that he was unlikely to benefit from a statin and this medication was discontinued.
The ACE inhhibitor was not restarted due to low blood pressures.
High-grade diffuse large B-cell cardiac lymphoma: treatement deferred to primary oncologist.
Chronic back pain:  Pt reported left lumbar back spasm and pain which was improved with lidocaine patch and tylenol.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.

You likely had an exacerbation of your heart failure as well as a pneumonia.
You were treated with diuresis and antibiotics.
You had low blood pressure likely from rapid diuresis.
Please contact your doctor or go to the emergency room if you have any of the following symptoms: chest pain or pressure, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, fevers, chills, worsening cough, lower leg swelling, weight gain >3lbs or other concerning symtpoms.
