A possible left temporal AVM was noted on MRI at that time, and he was scheduled for a CT angio later this month.
However, at approximately 0130 this am, he noted a sudden onset headache with associated nausea and vomiting.
He also sustained a ground-level fall, and his wife took him to an outside hospital where a head CT revealed an intraventricular hemorrhage which involved the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], 4th, 3rd, and left lateral ventricles.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical care.
A CT angio at [**Hospital1 18**] revealed the hemorrhage is stable, and left mesial temporal flow voids suggestive of AVM is noted as well.
Past Medical History: benign prostatic hypertrophy,meningioma, s/p electrohydraulic lithotripsy of bladder stones  Social History: resides at home with wife  Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: On Admission: T: 99.1 BP: 183/64    HR:81    R16       O2Sats 98% Gen: WD/WN, comfortable, NAD.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
His left pupil is slightly smaller than the right but both are reactive.
There is evidence of thrush in the oropharynx which is significantly improved since he has been on nystatin.
His right side is full strength and he has mild weakness on the left side.
6.4 x 3.8 cm right frontal mass with adjacent vasogenic edema.
Left midline shift.
Intraventricular hemorrhage.
Unchanged appearance of intraventricular hemorrhage with mild-to-moderate hydrocephalus.
Unchanged appearance of right frontal extra-axial mass with mass effect and vasogenic edema.
Head CT([**10-5**]): IMPRESSION: In comparison with a prior examination, no significant changes are demonstrated, persistent effacement of the sulci and mass effect, related with the frontal extra-axial mass lesion.
Left frontal ventriculostomy, apparently unchanged, persistent intraventricular hemorrhage.
Persistent sulcal effacement and mass effect related to the right frontal extra-axial mass lesion.
Left frontal ventriculostomy and persistent intraventricular hemorrhage.
Head CT([**10-9**]): CONCLUSION: No evidence of new hemorrhage.
Decrease in the volume of intraventricular hemorrhage since the study of [**2192-10-6**].
Unchanged large right frontal mass most likely a meningioma with extensive mass effect and midline shift.
Head CT ([**10-15**]): IMPRESSION: Interval decrease in intraventricular hemorrhage.
Post-surgical changes, with a small amount of pneumocephalus overlying the left frontal lobe, as well as air within the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle.
No new foci of hemorrhage.
Stable large right frontal extra-axial mass, with calcifications and associated vasogenic edema.
Minimal increased leftward subfalcine herniation.
A possible left temporal AVM was noted on MRI at that time, and he was scheduled for a CT angio later this month.
However, at approximately 0130 on the date of admission, he noted a sudden onset headache with associated nausea and vomiting.
He also sustained a ground-level fall, and his wife took him to an outside hospital where a head CT revealed an intraventricular hemorrhage which involved the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], 4th, 3rd, and left lateral ventricles.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical care.
A CT angio at [**Hospital1 18**] revealed the hemorrhage is stable, and left mesial temporal flow voids suggestive of AVM is noted as well.
Due to a rather expeditious neurological decline, he was taken for an emergent placement of an intraventricular drainage catheter, followed by a emergent angiogram to further identify the lesion.
Unfortunatley there was an aneurysm identified, however within the AVM itself, and thereby ineligible for coil embolization.
Unfortunately due to persistantly elevated ICPs with clamping of the EVD, he was determined to be an appropriate candidate for VP shunt placement.
Metoprolol Tartrate 50 mg Tablet Sig: 1.5 Tablets PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for htn.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: AVM w/ intranidal aneurysm, intra-ventricular hemorrhage, Large superior right extra-axial lesion   Discharge Condition: Neurologically stable   Discharge Instructions: General Instructions  ??????
