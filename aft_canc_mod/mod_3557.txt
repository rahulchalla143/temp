CXR [**2201-2-4**] As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the pre-existing left pneumothorax is unchanged.
Also unchanged is the left basal fluid collection as well as the relatively extensive left parenchymal opacity.
No evidence of tension.
Moderate left hydropneumothorax and small right pleural effusion.
Extensive left lung consolidation and airway plugging, worst in the left lower lobe.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 10940**] is an 80y/o gentleman with Afib, HTN, MDS and new left pleural effusion who underwent an outpatient thoracentesis complicated by apical PTX requiring MICU admission for 100% NRB to help reabsorption.
Left lung consolidation and airway plugging: no clinical manifestations.
He had no change in his repiratory status; imaging revealed these findings and he was advised to undergo bronchoscopy, but he declined.
It was felt that his tachycardia could be contributing to an element of diastolic HF so he was started on Metoprolol with resulting rate ~100.
Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital because you were told that you had a pneumothorax (air that escaped from the lung into the chest cavity) after a thoracentesis.
You still have a pneumothorax, and it is STRONGLY ADVISED for you to stay in the hospital for a procedure known as a bronchoscopy.
In addition to your pneumothorax, you have a fast heart rate which could be contributing to some fluid in the lungs.
