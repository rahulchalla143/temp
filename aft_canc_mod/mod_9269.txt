Name:  [**Known lastname 13224**],[**Known firstname **]                  Unit No:   [**Numeric Identifier 13225**]  Admission Date:  [**2173-7-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-8-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2099-12-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5613**] Addendum: The patient was kept from discharge on account her history of MRSA colonization and therefore the rehab institution's requirement that she fill a private room.
While awaiting placement, however, she experienced an episode of worsening hypoxia.
The respiratory failure was probably due to multiple factors.
And third, given the green colour of her sputum and the NEW leukocytosis, she likely has a new pneumonia.
Also, two points of correction to the previous discharge summary: 1) after discussing further with the radiologist, it has been confirmed that the patient has suffered a subacute stroke that may be embolic in nature.
2) It should also be corrected that the patient's echocardiogram with bubble study DID show a PFO as well as pulmonary hypertension.
Arterial Disease - Patient should remain on Aspirin and Clopidogrel.
This is the recommended treatment from our neurologists for her cerebrovascular disease.
