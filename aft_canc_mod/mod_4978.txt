Admission Date:  [**2102-3-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2102-4-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2049-7-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4679**] Chief Complaint: Arm pain, left lung empyema  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1. left video-assisted thoracoscopic converted to left thoracotomy, decortication of lung   History of Present Illness: This is a 52 year old male who presents for management of cervical osteomyelitis.
There, he had withdrawal seizures, and was intubated with aspiration pneumonia and bacteremia, treated for blood cultures growing MSSA which was treated with oxacillin and then cefpodoxime.
He also had a left pleural effusion that was tapped, and a left knee effusion that was tapped (results not present).
Today, he saw his PCP for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] few days of neck pain and right posterior upper arm pain, associated with numbness and tingling in the right fingertips.
C-spine plain films were abnormal so he had an outpatient MRI showing C6-7 osteomyelitis (although some parts of the record indicate C2-3).
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezes.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No black or bloody stools.
EXT: WWP, 2+ PT and radial pulses, no edema.
Mixed lytic/sclerotic destruction of endplates at multiple levels of the cervical spine consistent with chronic osteomyelitis.
Multilevel degenerative changes and mild spinal canal stenosis at the level of C6.
CXR [**3-28**]: No previous images.
There is a moderately large left pleural effusion with underlying compressive atelectasis.
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
Anterior and posterior epidural abscesses extending from the thoracic into the lumbar spine as described above, with abnormal thickening and enhancement of the dura as well as several nerve roots in the cauda equina.
Incompletely assessed abnormal signal and enhancement within the C6-7 intervertebral disc and C7 vertebral body, better seen on the recent MRI of the cervical spine, compatible with the known discitis/osteomyelitis.
Probable hemangioma in the T11 vertebral body anteriorly; continued attention to this area on follow up is recommended to exclude any superimposed infection.
Abnormal signal within the thoracic cord at T10-11 without abnormal enhancement.
This could represent edema or ischemic change resulting from the surrounding abnormalities.
No thoracic or lumbar cord compression.
Abnormal signal in the posterior soft tissues of the lumbar spine suggestive of inflammation.
Abnormal enhancement within the right psoas muscle without discrete fluid collection.
Loculated fluid collection within the left lower lobe of the lung.
Dark bone marrow signal diffusely on T1 weighted images suggestive of chronic anemia versus bone marrow replacement.
ECHO [**3-30**]:  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**3-31**] CT head: 1)Moderate sized left pleural effusion with smooth pleural thickening and probable loculation is incompletely evaluated in the absence of IV contrast.
2)Diffuse tiny centrilobular nodules are predominantly in the left lower lobe, suggesting a diffuse bronchiolitis, possibly due to a viral infection.
No evidence of deep venous thrombus.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2102-3-28**] for evaluation and treatment of cervical osteomyelitis as well as aspiration pneumonia and bacteremia, after having recently received treatment at an outside hospital for aspiration pneumonia and bacteremia.
On [**2102-4-4**], the patient underwent a left video-assisted thoracoscopic converted to left thoracotomy and decortication of lung, which went well without complication (please refer to Operative Note for details).
-Osteomyelitis: pt was admitted for evaluation of his cervical osteomyelitis.
-Epidural abcesses: pt was noted to have multiple thoracic/lumbar epidural abcesses which were drained by interventional neurology.
Fluid was sent for gram stain/cx with no evidence of organisms or growth.
-pleural effusion: known from prior admission, without any evidence of respiratory compromise.
-anemia - Pt with a history of heavy EtOH use and has a normocytic anemia.
Iron studies are indicative of an anemia of chronic disease.
-leukocytosis-likely due to osteomyelitis, epidural abcesses and surgical intervention.
-thrombocytosis - likely reactionary, secondary to cervical osteomyelitis .
-hyperlipidemia - pt was continued on his home statin .
US showed no clot.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
The patient's osteomyelitis and epidural abscess was determined to be non-operative and to be to be treated with a course of IV antibiotics.
He was followed by infectious disease recommended 6 week course of Vancomycin [**Date range (1) 86699**] in the setting of osteomyelitis, epidural abcesses and hx of MSSA bacteremia as well as MRSA growth in endotracheal tube at last admission and in the nares.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
