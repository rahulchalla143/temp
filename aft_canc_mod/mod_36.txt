HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 1726**] is a 60-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, times two, who developed a dry cough in late [**Month (only) **] while fly fishing in [**State 1727**].
The patient describes the cough as dry, not worse at night, breath.
He denied fevers and  chills.
Over the past one to two weeks, however, he has noted increasing dyspnea with stairs, as well as fatigue.
At his primary care physician's office today, he had a chest x-ray which disclosed an enlarged heart and interstitial infiltrates.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done, as well as an echocardiogram which disclosed evidence of a pericardial effusion with tamponade.
There was diastolic collapse of the right atrium and right ventricle.
The patient was sent to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital6 256**] for evaluation of the pericardial effusion and drainage.
The echocardiogram performed in the Emergency Department was consistent with cardiac tamponade.
Myxomatous mitral valve prolapse with mild mitral regurgitation.
Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.
Chronic asymptomatic VEA.
Peripheral vision loss.
FAMILY HISTORY:  No heart disease and no diabetes mellitus.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No fevers, chills or night sweats.
Patient reports a six pound intentional weight loss over the past two months.
No history of positive PPD or Tuberculosis exposure.
No upper respiratory infection symptoms with cough.
No nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal pain, but occasionally "spits up" after his cough.
Reports dyspnea with stairs and chest tightness occasionally on stairs.
No rash, no joint symptoms, no melanoma, no bright red blood per rectum, no dysuria, no edema, no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, no orthopnea, no palpitations, no dizziness.
Neck:  Supple, no carotid bruit, no jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, soft S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops, pericardial drain in place.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**11-16**] for pericardiocentesis.
Hemodynamics showed elevated and equal RA and pericardial pressures, 11-12 mm mercury, slightly lower than pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
There was preserved cardiac index.
During the pericardiocentesis, 1116 ml of serosanguinous fluid was easily removed.
Patient underwent CT of the chest which disclosed diffuse interstitial infiltrates consistent with lymphangitic spread.
There was also a positive mediastinal lymphadenopathy and lytic sclerotic bone lesions.
MRI disclosed foci on the surface of the brain that appeared consistent with leptomeningeal spread of cancer.
CT of the abdomen disclosed one lymphangitic spread of metastatic disease throughout the lungs was stable since the study one week before.
There was an increase in the pericardial fluid since the study one week prior.
There was interval development of multiple sclerotic and lytic lesions within the osseous structures since [**2139**].
There were stable hepatic lesions that likely represent simple cysts.
There was a stable splenic lesion that likely represents a hemangioma.
Finally, pathology results from pericardial fluid were obtained.
Pathologist's concluded that this immunoprofile is consistent with an adenocarcinoma arising in the lung.
Patient was given [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Heart's monitor so that his QTC interval could be monitored for an additional week while on sotalol.
Pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade.
Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.
Atrial Fibrillation.
