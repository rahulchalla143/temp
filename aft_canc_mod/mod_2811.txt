He was recently treated for pneumonia but dyspnea persisted.
He was referred to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED where he became acutely unresponsive and hypotensive.
Bedside echo revealed right heart strain and right heart failure raising further concern for PE.
CTA confirmed diagnosis of bilateral PA PEs.
ECG showed new TWI in V1-V3 with elevated CK's.
Labs showed acute renal failure, lactic acidosis, and +AG metabolic acidosis.
Past Medical History: Hypertension morbid obesity Type II diabetes mellitus c/b nephropathy, baseline creat not known CAD s/p cath [**10/2149**] showing 1v dz, s/p bare metal stent to RCA  CHF - EF not known Gout   Social History: divorced.
remote tob use, quit at age 23. no etoh, illicits  Family History: mother and father d. complications of diabetes  Physical Exam: T 101.5 HR 97 BP 174/74 RR 30 100% AC Tv 600 RR 26 FiO2 100% PEEP 10 GEN: responding to commands, comfortable HEENT: PERRL, anicteric, ETT/OGT Neck: JVP not appreciated, no LAD CV: distant heart sounds, regular Resp: coarse anteriorly with occasional crackle, clear posteriorly Abd: obese, soft, NT, ND, +BS Ext: venous stasis changes, decreased but palp DP L, radial, nonpalp DP R, no edema Neuro: responds to command to squeeze hands, moves all extremities   Pertinent Results: Radiology: BLENI: Non-occlusive filling defect in right common femoral vein.
No left lower extremity DVT.
CTA: Large bilateral pe's including withing the right and left main pulmonary arteries; perhaps slight right ventricular enlargement, but no pulmonary artery enlargement .
CXR: Linear areas of atelectasis and area of subsegemental atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 55yoM with h/o HTN, CAD, TIIDM p/w massive bilateral PE resulting in obstructive shock, NSTEMI, and right heart failure who underwent surgery for colonic mass found upon colonoscope for GI bleed.
# PE/shock: Massive PE with resultant obstructive shock and right heart failure s/p lysis with TPA.
Echo showed RV strain and RV dilation.
A right sided permanent IVF filter was placed due to clot burden in the right right common femoral vein.
Patient was also started on stress dose steroids due to h/o of chronic prednisone use due to either gout vs. nephrotic syndrome.
Patient likely needs to be anticoagulated in the long term given PE and permanent IVC filter.
Initial gas showed inadequate compensation for metabolic acidosis which improved with increase in resp rate.
He was weaned off the vent and extubated on [**1-29**] without complications.
Patient developed melena while on IV Heparin.
EGD by GI showed mild gastritis.
Patient had ongoing melena with stable Hct.
?if this is causing melena given lesion is distal, ?small bowel lesion as well.
Plans for sigmoidoscopy by GI on Monday [**2-5**] for bx vs. excision.
# Colonic mass:  The patient underwent a colonoscopy which revealed a large mass in the distal sigmoid or upper rectum.
Plans were made for colonoscopic resection.
# Leukocytosis with left shift and bandemia.
Patient remained afebrile throughout the hospitalization.
# ARF: h/o chronic kidney disease d/t diabetic/hypertensive nephropathy vs. h/o nephrotic syndrome.
ARF likely prerenal azotemia vs. ATN.
# Hypertension.
Patient hypotensive and in shock initially, started to become hypertensive off all meds on [**2-2**].
Also given prn IV hydral for elevated systolic pressures.
# Bradycardia.
# Post operative course: The patient's course was uncomplicated.
