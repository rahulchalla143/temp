She also states she has occasional abdominal pain.
She also reports significant weight gain attributed entirely to edema in her legs and ascites collection in her abdomen.

Pancreatic cancer, as described above.
Portal venous thrombosis.
Gemcitabine causes bleeding and hives.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  There is no history of alcohol, or tobacco exposure, or injection drug use.
HEENT:  She had a clear oropharynx with dry mucous membranes.

ABDOMEN:  Distended with a fluid wave and percussion splash present.
No organs palpable.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm, no rash, no clubbing, no cyanosis.
There was +2 edema from the toes to the midcalves.
She then underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy which revealed an actively bleeding gastric ulcer that underwent epinephrine injection on [**2154-12-31**] with good hemostasis.
However, repeat endoscopic evaluation on [**2155-1-2**] showed persistent bleeding from said site.
Attempts at electrocautery and epinephrine injection did not limit the bleeding significantly, and at the time of this dictation serial hematocrit checks were continuing.
Owing to the patient's poor nutrition, a percutaneously inserted central catheter was placed, and total parenteral nutrition was administered without complications.
Once the patient's hemodynamic status was stabilized, furosemide and spironolactone were added to her medications to relieve the peripheral edema, specifically to decrease the swelling in her legs and the ascites.
