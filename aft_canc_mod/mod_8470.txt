CHEST, TWO VIEWS ([**2200-7-2**]): bilateral small pleural effusions, enlarged cardiac silhouette .
[**Last Name (un) **] RA diastolic collapse, no RV collapse.
Accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows.
RV mildly dilated.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No sign of tamponade ECHO [**7-10**] trivial pericardial effusion.
Flexible Bronchoscopy: No anatomic abnormalities.
No blood, plugging, purulence, or endobronchial tumor encountered.
There was some minimal thin secretions in the right lower lobe basilar segments.
CXR [**7-11**]: The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged including mild cardiomegaly and tortuous and calcified aorta.
The right lung demonstrate unchanged linear areas of atelectasis especially in the right lower lobe.
Small right pleural effusion is again noted, unchanged.
No pneumothorax is present.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence for acute changes.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 103207**] is an 83 y/o M with known CAD, HTN, cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis, h/o HCC, h/o hepatic encephalopathy admitted with chest pain and found to have a worsening pericardial effusion/cardiac tamponade compared to ECHO [**2200-6-18**], now s/p R heart cath and pericardocentesis [**7-2**], and R. VATS, pericardial window [**7-3**].
# Pericardial effusion/ pre-tamponade: Pt admitted on [**7-2**] with chest pain and significant worsening of pericardial effusion on echocardiogram indicating tamponade.
The etiology of the patient's effusion is unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) **] has a prior known malignancy (HCC) with recent new liver lesions on CT of the abdomen; however, AFP < 1, and pericardial fluid cytology was negative for malignant cells.
Due to a gram stain result on [**7-3**] which showed gram positive rods in the pericardial fluid, he was treated with one dose of Ceftriaxone.
However it was felt that this finding was most likely a result of contamination because no other fluid or culture specimens showed bacteria, pt.
was afebrile without a white count.
Flexible bronchoscopy and thoracotomy showed no evidence of malignancy.
Serial CXR's showed R. lower pleural effusion and R.lower lobe atelectasis.
Pain was given morphine for pain control.
His last echo on [**7-10**] showed a trivial pericardial effusion.
He remained without symptoms of tamponade for the remainder of this admission.
#SOB-Thought to be due to pain s/p procedures, possible ascites .
Brief MICU course: Patient transferred to MICU team on [**2200-7-10**] due to the development of altered mental status after pericardial window and the development of a slow GI bleed.
He was evaluated by the GI service and Hct was monitored and found to be consistant with a slow bleed.
Patient had non-contrast head CT which found no acute changes.
Cardiac echo found a very small pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade.
Mr [**Known lastname 103207**] had spontaneous resoution of mental status changes and per liver team recommendation had a meeting with palliative care regarding long term treatment options and goals of care.
While back on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2, patient HCT's remained stable, he had occasional guiac + stools with no gross blood.
# Coronary artery disease: Chest pain on admission does not appear to be due to ACS (enzymes negative).
Asa and plavix were dc'd in light of recent bleeding.
Chest pain during admission was related to the chest tube placement and surgical intervention.
It did not have qualities of angina and work up was negative.
# Alcoholic vs [**Hospital Ward Name **] cirrhosis: Has been complicated by encephalopathy in the past.
Patient developed altered mental status-delerium in hospital.
Possibilities included narcotic pain medication, hepatic encephalopathy, "hospital delirium", sleeping medication.
However, patient's altered mental status returned to During this admission antihypertensives(nadolol, spironolactone) were held due to hypotension.
Spironolactone will be held for now and restarted as an outpatient with following of his electrolytes.
Recent imaging suggests reoccurance of the disease.
He did not have enough ascites for diagnostic and therapeutic tap this admission.
Ambien eventually dc/d due to mental status changes and trazadone given.
He was on SC heparin; however this had to be stopped secondary to bleeding.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.

Hypertension 4.)
Hypothyroidism 5.)
Gastrointestinal bleeding   Discharge Condition: good, vitals stable, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were in the hospital because of a pericardial effusion, or a collection of fluid around your heart.
Then, you developed bleeding from your gastrointestinal tract.
If you have worsening shortness of breath or chest pain, fevers, notice blood in your stool or darkening of the stool, or your condition worsens in any way, seek immediate medical attention by calling your doctor's office or going to the emergency room.
