Pathology/cytology: LEFT NECK MASS Procedure Date of [**2118-5-4**] SPECIMEN RECEIVED: [**2118-5-4**]    11-[**Numeric Identifier **]    LEFT NECK MASS SPECIMEN DESCRIPTION: Received in cytolyt  Prepared 1 ThinPrep slide CLINICAL DATA: Lt neck mass ?
parathyroid vs enlarged lymph node.
Rare focus of parathyroid glandular tissue (see note).
Immunohistochemical stains   performed on the cell block (see S11-[**Pager number 21470**]B) demonstrate   immunoreactivity to parathyroid hormone.
The immunophenotype   is consistent with parathyroid tissue.
Clinical and   radiologic correlation are necessary to determine if the   findings represent neoplasia (parathyroid hyperplasia,   adenoma or carcinoma).

parathyroid vs. enlarged lymph node.
A cell block is made using the plasma-thrombin method and is entirely submitted in cassette A for permanent section.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 41 year old right handed woman transferred from OSH with new focal neurological deficit found to have right MCA CVA with hospital course complicated by hypercalcemia secondary to parathyroid adenoma s/p resection.
#CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT: She presented with loss of speech, left facial droop and left upper extremity weakness and was found to have an embolic [**Doctor Last Name **] to R frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes in the right MCA distribution on imaging (CTA of head and neck showed M1 occlusion).
Her risk factors for [**Doctor Last Name **] included hypertension and hyperparathyroidism.
Trans-thoracic echocardiogram did not show evidence of embolic phenomenon (including no ASD/PFO and LVEF>55%).
There was a concern for occult cancer given high calcium, 70 lbs weight loss, and abnormal parathyorid nodule found and resected as will be discussed below.
She continued to have left sided weakness of upper and lower extremities with gaze deviation at discharge.
#HYPERTENSION: She was not on any anti-hypertensives as an outpatient but was noted to be hypertensive on initial presetnation and initially required nicardipine drip for BP control.
There was evidence of LVH noted on EKG.
#HYPERCALCEMIA [**1-19**] PARATHRYOID ADENOMA:  She was found to have a calcium of 12 with a free calcium of 1.60 on admission.
CTA head/neck showed a 2.8 x 1.8cm left thyroid mass.
Parathyroid scan showed persistent uptake in the in the left mid-and inferior thyroid lobe and the anterior mediastinum (substernal) concerning for parathyroid tissue.
Fine needle aspiration of the mass revealed parathyroid tissue consistent with a parathyroid adenoma.
Repeat FNA of thyroid nodule showed thyroid follicular cells that were likely benign.
General endocrine surgery performed an inferior parathyroidectomy on [**2118-5-18**].
The pathology showed left parathyroid tissue consistent with adenoma and unremarkable lymph nodes.
Her electrolytes were followed closely post-operatively and there was no evidence of hungry bone syndrome.
Her calcium and parathyroid hormone normalized.
#PAROTID MASS: She was found to have a lobular 1.4 cm soft tissue density lesion in the right parotid gland.
#PLEURITIC CHEST PAIN:  She reported intermittent pleuritic chest pain during the hospitalization.
There was no evidence of pneumonia.
#MENORRHAGIA: It was discussed with the patient that it is possible that her oral contaceptive pill (Yaz) could have led to a hypercoagulable state resulting in CVA.
#UTI:  Patient was found to have UTI with urine culture growing >100,000 colonies of coag negative staph on [**5-10**].
#NUTRITION: Patient initially required Dobhoff for medication and aspiration risk diet.
We discussed the importance of obtaining a primary care physician as well as outpatient ENT evaluation of the parotid mass as well as endocrinology and gynecology follow up.
