Admission Date:  [**2150-8-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2150-8-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2080-1-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: my doctor told me to come here - I have something in my brain   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: tumor resection, crani  History of Present Illness: this is a 70 y/o white female who appears younger than her stated age, with a history of lung cancer with lobectomy [**2144**] (pt not sure what type of lung ca she had).
pt reports three weeks of unsteady gait - had outpt CT and then 2 days later (24th) had MRI/brain.
MRI from 24th with right cerebellar mass with some tonsilar herniation as well as effacement of the midbrain/brainstem.
Pt admits to unsteady gait, emesis x 1, as well as ha.
Denies falls, loc, trauma or visual changes.
No gross HCP on MRI.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift .
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2150-8-18**] 7:37 PM IMPRESSION: Right cerebellar mass with significant vasogenic edema effacing the right posterior basal cistern and exerting mass effect on the brainstem.
Prior MRI is not available to assess for interval change.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is mass effect upon the fourth ventricle.
However, there is no hydrocephalus.
Multiple hypodensities in the liver which have characteristics consistent with simple cysts.
Coarse calcification in the right breast.
Focal aneurysmal dilation of the intrahepatic inferior vena cava.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
BONE SCAN  [**2150-8-19**] IMPRESSION: No definite evidence of osseous metastases.
Probable degenerative changes in mid thoracic spine.
Comparison with a follow-up bone scan may be useful to assess for metastatic disease.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2150-8-22**] 9:43 PM IMPRESSION: 2.9 x 2.3 x 3.3 cm ring-enhancing mass involving the right cerebellum causing minimal mass effect upon the fourth ventricle.
No other enhancing lesions were identified.
Right mastoid opacification, and possible invasion by the cerebellar tumor.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2150-8-24**] 2:29 AM IMPRESSION: 1) Postoperative changes in the right cerebellar resection bed, with no significant change in the amount of effacement of the basilar cisterns and mass effect on the brainstem from the preop study.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2150-8-25**] 3:23 PM IMPRESSION: Status post resection of right-sided cerebellar lesion.
No residual enhancement is seen on the current examination.
There is, however, residual vasogenic edema still present and could be related to the recent patient's occipital craniotomy and cerebellar resection of the previously noted tumor.
Status post right suboccipital craniectomy and cerebellar tumor resection, with persistent post-surgical changes, as described.
There is no change in the degree of fourth ventricular and basilar cisternal effacement.
Right transfrontal ventricular drain is unchanged in position, with no interval change in size or shape of the ventricles.
She was initially due for EVD placement on [**8-21**]; this was delayed until [**8-22**].
Through both procedures, there were no intra-operative complications and the patient did well postoperatively and had no neurological new deficits.
She was tolerating a regular diet, and her incision looked clean, dry and intact.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet on this day and had no pain issues.
On [**8-28**], the patient had a repeat CT Head which was stable, and her EVD was removed (vent drain) without complications.
