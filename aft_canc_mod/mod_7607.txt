No bladder tenderness.
IMAGING: CXR: NG tube tip is either in the distal stomach or proximal duodenum.
There is residual contrast in the collecting system of the visualized portion of the right kidney and there is also oral contrast within the colon.
The mediastinum is slightly prominent, possibly due to supine technique.
There is right lower lobe infiltrate.
No evidence of active bleeding in the small bowel.
Gastrointestinal bleeding in the large bowel is unable to be assessed on this examination secondary to recent oral contrast administration from CT examination performed at an outside hospital.
Diffuse osseous metastatic disease, some of which demonstrate a soft tissue component.
Pathologic fracture involving the right medial acetabulum.
The largest metastatic lesions at L2, and the posterior elements of L3 are at risk of pathologic fracture.
Moderate simple right pleural effusion.
7-mm left adrenal nodule likely myelipoma or adenoma.
Colonoscopy ([**10-29**]): Findings: Flat Lesions - A single small angioectasia with stigmata of recent bleeding was seen in the 60 cm.
[**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully.
Protruding Lesions - A single sessile 5 mm non-bleeding polyp of benign appearance was found at ~18 cm.
Excavated Lesions - A few non-bleeding diverticula with small openings were seen in the distal sigmoid colon.
No pulmonary embolism.
Large right upper lobe mass with probable lymphangitic spread and mediastinal invasion and compression of the right upper lobe pulmonary arterial and obliteration of a right upper lobe bronchus.
Extensive mediastinal, subcarinal, and contralateral hilar lymphadenopathy.
Extensive bony metastatic disease involving a left anterior third rib, numerous vertebral bodies, and the sternum.
Increased size of a large right pleural effusion.
Small left pleural effusion with atelectasis.
Possible early aspiration has occurred in the left lower lobe with bronchial wall thickening that appears similar to the CT study performed two days prior.
CXR ([**11-1**]): IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-26**]: Large right hydropneumothorax is new since [**10-26**], including substantial volume of right pleural fluid.
Interstitial edema has developed in the left lung, probably due to redirection of pulmonary perfusion.
Focal opacity in the perihilar left upper lung could be pneumonia or aspiration.
Relatively mild leftward mediastinal shift suggests central adenopathy anchoring the mediastinum.
CXR ([**11-1**]): IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to 7:01 p.m.: Moderate-sized right hydropneumothorax is still substantial, only mildly smaller following the insertion of a small-bore catheter in the right upper hemithorax.
Interstitial edema persists because there right lung is substantially atelectatic, accounting for new small left pleural effusion.
Mediastinal widening reflects extensive adenopathy.
Rare groups of atypical epithelial cells.
Note: Recommend resubmission the entire fluid to cytology   for cellblock preparation and further evaluation, if fluid   reaccumulates.
Most recent CXR: [**11-6**] As compared to the previous radiograph, the distribution and the  extent of the left pleural effusion are unchanged.
On the right, a small new pleural effusion could have developed.
The pre-existing air collection in the right soft tissues has decreased and is in part not included on the image.
Unchanged, however, are the increases of interstitial density, likely to reflect interstitial fluid overload.

# GI bleed, with acute blood loss anemia: Pt with BRBPR concerning LGIB.
She then completed a bowel prep and underwent a colonoscopy on [**10-29**], which showed a single AVM with evidence of recent bleed, which was cauterized.
# Pleural Effusion:  The patient was noted to have a large right pleural effusion on CTA of the chest, performed to evaluate tachycardia.
A bedside thoracentesis was attempted by IP on [**11-1**], however, the patient developed a moderate sized pneumothorax and an anterior chest tube was placed at the bedside, with follow-up CXR showing good resolution of both the effusion and pneumothorax.
Pleural fluid analysis revealed an elevated LDH consistent with an exudate.
Chest tube was removed on [**11-3**] with no signs of reaccumulation of effusion and only small amt of pneumothorax.
Pleural fluid cytology is pending at this time and showed atypical cells, but not malignant cells.
# Metastatic lung ca, with malignant pain syndrome: pt is s/p radiation and chemotherapy x 2 sessions.
Palliative care was consulted, with attempt to increase her methadone, but she developed an acute encephalopathy with higher doses of methadone, 5 mg po bid and 10 mg po qhs.
She also has prn Oxycodone for breakthrough pain.
She was noted to have a pathologic fracture of her right acetabulum.
Her outpatient Oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 31966**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] on multiple occasions, but her functional status has declined significantly and her ability to tolerate further chemotherapy will need to be assessed after her strength improves.
# sinus tachycardia: initially thought to be [**1-31**] volume loss in the setting of GIB, but it was not responsive to fluids or PRBC overnight and has been persistently tachycardic during admission.
Had 3 negative troponins to rule out active cardiac ischemia, and also had normal TSH.
Pain adequately managed, and receiving Ativan for anxiety as needed.
Sinus tachycardia is likely pt's underlying baseline due to underlying malignancy or her COPD.
# Oral thrush: pt was noted to have some oral thrush on exam on [**11-2**] and started on Nystatin.
She found this intolerable due to nausea and was switched to oral clotrimazole with good effect.
# Acute cystitis: Pt was found to have acute cystitis on [**11-3**] and started on a course of levofloxacin to be completed on [**11-10**].
Levofloxacin used over cipro given equivalent E coli coverage but better coverage of respiratory infections in this vulnerable pt with ?
# Urinary retention: On [**11-3**] soon after UTI diagnosis an attempt was made to DC foley but the patient developed urinary retention and foley replaced.
KUB on [**2181-11-8**] showed no obstruction or ileus.
Goals of care: She was seen by palliative care, and there were extensive discussions with her family, including her son, [**Name (NI) **], regarding goals of care.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
A source of bleed was identified, and the bleeding was stopped by cautery.
You were also noted to have lots of fluid around your right lung, so you underwent a drainage of the fluid, which was complicated by partial collapse of the right lung, so a chest tube had to be placed.
You continue to have some nausea and some pain, but you are otherwise stable.
You do have to have a catheter in your bladder due to your inability to urinate.
