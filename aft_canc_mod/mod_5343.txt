A CT scan of the chest and abdomen demonstrated 2 small left upper lobe pulmonary nodules of uncertain etiology but concerning for malignancy.
His abdominal CT demonstrated a left lower quadrant mass that on biopsy was demonstrated to be a GIST tumor that was C-kit positive.
In addition, this CT demonstrated a large mass in the right lobe of the liver that was initially thought to represent an abscess but an attempted CT guided drainage demonstrated only a small amount of blood.
Biopsies demonstrated only granulation tissue.
The patient had a recent follow-up CT scan that demonstrated rapid and significant enlargement of the right lobe mass.
It was uncertain whether this represented a liver abscess or a tumor with necrosis and secondary infection.
Because of the rapid enlargement of the mass and inability to drain this percutaneously along with continued fevers and malaise, the patient is brought to the operating room after informed consent was obtained for right hepatic lobectomy, cholecystectomy and resection of the left lower quadrant GIST tumor.

Unchanged left upper lobe ground-glass ill-defined nodules may represent metastatic disease versus primary pulmonary neoplasm.
Left lower quadrant mass as described consistent with biopsy proven GI stromal tumor.
Large multiloculated low-density collection with enhancing rim seen on prior examination, slightly increased in size and in segment VI consistent with progression of hemorrhage/malignancy.
Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
New trace perihepatic fluid.
No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
[**5-19**] Liver biopsy: Liver core biopsy: Granulation tissue with a focally prominent acute inflammatory component.
Organizing fibrinous exudate.
The adjacent hepatic parenchyma shows acutely inflamed portal triads; no malignancy identified.
[**5-23**] Duplex: CONCLUSION: Status post right hepatic lobectomy with patent portal, hepatic arterial and hepatic venous flow.
Echogenic material surrounding the remaining liver may represent areas of surgical packing, omental plugs and/or Surgicel.
Multiple dilated loops of small bowel and large bowel.
Bilateral atelectatic changes are noted at lung bases, more prominent on the right.
Small pneumoperitoneum, not unexpected after recent surgery.
The appearance of the liver parenchyma and adjacent small hematoma is not significantly changed from 3 days earlier.
Left and right branches of the hepatic artery are not visualized on today's study, possibly secondary to technical factors.
Brief Hospital Course: This patient was admitted to the transplant surgical service on [**5-18**] with the chief complaint of fevers and malaise.
A CXR showed no acute cardio-pulmonary process.
On [**5-21**], the pt was found to have a positive C.Diff (sent for watery stools).
Overnight of POD0, he received 2 Litres in fluid bolus in total for low urine output and SBP in the 80's.
On POD1, the patient remained very sleepy and was not responding to stimuli.
On [**5-23**] (POD1), he received 2 units of FFP (for an elevated INR) with no correction of INR.
On POD3 ([**5-25**]), patient's respiratory saturations were noted to be approx 93%, most likely due to atelectasis.
On [**5-26**], he was noted to have signs of hepatic decompensation with decreased mental status, asterixis, decreased urine output, ascites and increased bilirubin.
The patient had a voiding trial on [**5-30**], as reccomended by the urology service.
A bedside swallowing evaluation was done on [**6-1**] during which he presented with mild oral dysphagia and it was determined he could continue with a regular consistency diet with thin liquids.
This showed a normal appearing biliary tree with no evidence of obstruction or a leak.
His wound was clean, dry and intact, and only required a dry gauze dressing over the area (no packing necessary).
