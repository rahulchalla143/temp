Admission Date:  [**2148-5-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2148-5-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-9-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**] Chief Complaint: Maroon stools  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Full hx as per ICU admit note.
Briefly, this is a 72 year old man with a past medical history significant for metastatic gastric cancer (tolerating adriamycin after failing multiple regimens), localized prostate cancer, bilateral cephalic vein thromboses in the setting of coumadin therapy in [**2148-4-9**], and portacath thrombus in [**2148-1-11**] who presented with four days of dark stools and hematocrit drop from 37 to 24, and intermittent abdominal pain and nausea, after being discharged to nursing facility on [**5-13**] on chronic lovenox therapy.
In the ICU, the pt underwent an EGD with showed a fungating mass with stigmata of recent bleeding of malignant appearance was found in the antrum of the stomach.
There was an ulcer within the mass, with an adherent clot.
However, after the procedure the patient continued to have bleeding and an angiography was performed.
Subsequently the patient has been doing well and no more drop in the hct was noted.
The patient is currently doing well and denies any further abdominal pain or nausea/vomiting.
Past Medical History: -Gastric cancer diagnosed in [**2147-7-11**]; found on workup of iron-deficiency anemia with metastsis to lymph nodes and liver treated initiially with two cycles of ELF chemotherapy with disease progression followed by weekly irinotecan stopped secondary to toxicity.
Started Taxol [**11-7**] discontinued due to a drug-eruptive rash.
-Hypertension -Prostate cancer, [**Doctor Last Name **] 3+4 tx with watchful waiting -Right portacath associated SVC thrombus and removal [**2148-1-26**] with new port placed on left at same time.
Family History: Per [**Name (NI) **], mother died of breast cancer at age 36, brother died of pancreatic cancer at age 69, other brother died of prostate cancer, and his father died of a myocardial infarction.
Physical Exam: T:99.6 BP:109/59 HR:76 RR:19 O2saturation: 100% on 2L nasal canula Gen: Pleasant elderly man in no apparent distress.
HEENT: Slight conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
Slightly dry mucous membranes.
No cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
No wheezes, crackles, or rhonci appreciated.
No guarding or rebound.
No clubbing or cyanosis.
2+ dorsalis pedis and radial pulses, bilaterally.
[**5-21**] Embolization: IMPRESSION: Vascular mass at the gastric antrum and proximal duodenum level supplied by the GDA.
No active extravasation of contrast was seen.
[**5-23**] MRI MRI OF THE BRAIN: There is no evidence of acute brain ischemia or intracranial hemorrhage.
No structural, signal, or enhancement abnormalities are noted within the brain parenchyma.
Apparent signal and enhancement abnormality in the inferior frontal lobes bilaterally are most consistent with artifact from the adjacent cribriform plates.
Calcification in the choroid plexus as well as choroidal vasculature is noted bilaterally.
There is no hydrocephalus.
There is thickening of multiple ethmoid air cells.
No fluid is noted within the mastoid air cells or other paranasal sinuses.
MRA OF THE BRAIN: There is no evidence of aneurysmal dilation, significant stenosis, or arteriovenous malformation.
IMPRESSION: No definite signal or enhancement abnormalities within the brain parenchyma are definitely seen.
The preliminary read suggested some abnormalities thought to be within the medial temporal lobes and within the gyri recti of the frontal lobes; the former is thought to represent choroid plexus vasculature and the latter artifact arising from adjacent cribriform plates, a common finding when a 3T scanner is used.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Probable minimal subsegmental atelectasis at the left lung base.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Minimal subsegmental atelectasis at the left lung base.
[**5-23**] CT Head FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, or infarction.
There is no hydrocephalus.
Small hypodensities in bilateral thalami may be old lacunes and were present on head CT, [**2148-1-24**].
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage or infarction.
Again, please note that non-contrast head CT is relatively insensitive for detection of metastatic disease and contrast-enhanced MRI is recommended if this is a clinical concern.
[**5-23**] EEG IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to the mildly slow and disorganized  background.
No areas of prominent focal slowing were evident, and there were no epileptiform features.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis of the right internal jugular, subclavian, or axillary veins.
No findings consistent with SVC syndrome.
[**5-27**] MRV Lower portions of both the right and left internal jugular veins are widely patent, as are both the right and left brachiocephalic veins.
There is mild narrowing of the SVC in its mid portion, although it is difficult to determine whether this represents a nondistended state or a functional stenosis/stricture.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.
A mass is seen within the left lobe of the liver on the coronal SSFSE images.
No evidence of SVC conclusion.
Mild narrowing may be present in the mid portion of the SVC, although we cannot assess whether this is truly anatomic stenosis or simply physiogical due to nondistension.
Short segment of partial obstruction versus stenosis in the central portion of the right subclavian vein.
Patent appearance of the visualized portions of both the right and left internal jugular veins as well as the brachiocephalic veins.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment/Plan: 72 year old man with a past medical history significant for metastatic gastric cancer, thrombotic events, and MSSA bacteremia who was recently discharged to a nursing home on lovenox, admitted with 4d of dark, guiaiac positive stools and 12 point Hct drop, now s/p ICU stay with 4 [**Location **] transfusion and unsuccessfull EGD with epinephrine injection into bleeding gastric mass and subsequently embolization.
#) GI bleed: Known gastric cancer with hypercoaguable state.
Hematocrit noted to have decreased from 36.8 on [**5-15**] to 23.8 on admission.
He underwent an EGD that showed a large gastric mass with central ulceration and recent bleeding.
TTE negative for vegetations and TEE deferred.
Given his prior history of deep vein thrombosis, upper extremity ultrasounds were obtained and notable for bilateral cephalic vein DVTs.
Surveillance for infected clots negative.
#) Hypercoagulability: Extensive personal and presumed family history of thromboses, with port-associated thrombus requiring port removal with placement of a new left-sided port in [**2148-1-11**], followed by SVC thrombus requiring TPA in [**2148-3-10**].
On previous admission in [**2148-5-10**], upper extremity ultrasounds were obtained that were notable for bilateral upper extremity cephalic vein DVTs.
His INR was therapeutic on admission, but in late [**Month (only) 547**], subtherapuetic for short period.
Megace was discontinued during last admission due to its potential prothrombotic characteristics.
At continuned high risk for thromboses.
In setting of GI bleed, held lovenox and will continue to hold for now per his oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].. .
On previous hospitalization in [**Month (only) 116**]-[**2148-5-10**], noted to be guaiac positive and required one unit of packed red blood cells.
#) Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr on admission noted to be 1.6.
His creatinine did not change with IVF and no renal abnormalities were found on renal ultrasound.
No obvious cause was found for his disorientation and his mental status cleared over the next 24 hours.
With neurology consulting, he was started empirically on keppra for seizure prevention as his presentation was most consistent with a post-ictal state although EEG did not show seizure activity.
No structural cause for seizure was found on MRI.
#) Diarrhea: he was noted to have increasing diarrhea around the time that he had mental status change.
He was negative X 3 for c.diff but as he had been on long-term antibiotics and had low-grade fevers/inc WBC count, he was started empirically on flagyl for a 7 day course and his diarrhea and fevers resolved.
