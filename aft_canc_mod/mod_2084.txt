Admission Date:  [**2177-9-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2177-9-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2130-3-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Keflex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6075**] Chief Complaint: word-finding difficulties  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: HPI: Patient is a 47 year old right handed man with past medical history of metastatic malignant melanoma who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2177-9-18**] for evaluation acute onset word finding difficulties x 3.5 hours.
Around 7:30pm, they were in their kitchen putting away groceries when she noted him to have word finding difficulties and naming problems.
Seemed to have some difficulty understanding directions and following what she was saying as well.
She did not note any facial droop or weakness.
Throughout, she still noticed word substitutions and some difficulty following conversation on his part.
After dinner, she called her friend, who is a nurse.
Per his wife, he has been confused at times since starting interleukin therapy for melanoma, but they attributed this to the chemo.
He underwent fine needle aspiration revealing melanoma versus carcinoma.
He underwent radiation therapy to the neck in [**2175-1-7**] secondary to extracapsular extension.
He began interferon in [**2175-2-4**], discontinued [**2175-11-6**] when biopsy of a sacral lesion noted on CT revealed melanoma.
He was followed with serial CTs with progressive L2 bony metastases noted on [**2176-11-6**].
Follow-up CTs revealed questionable right inguinal mass, questionable splenic lesion and an enlarging bony metastasis and L2 coupled with worsening back pain.
He began [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**2177-5-31**] with usual side effects as well as grade 4 thrombocytopenia after cycle #2 and grade III thrombocytopenia after cycle #3, requiring a 50% dose reduction in DTIC and vinblastine.
Follow-up CTs after cycle #4 revealed stable disease and 5 x 4-mm right lower lobe nodule of unclear significance.
Head CT in [**5-11**] with no evidence of metastatic disease.
No masses or LAD.
No thyromegaly.
No carotid bruits.
No rebound or guarding.
However, has anomia for low frequency items, makes frequent semantic paraphasic errors, is perserverative (named cactus off naming card then named next several items as cactus), and has some subtle problems with comprehension on complex and multistep commadns.
No dysarthria.
No apraxia, no neglect.
Optic disc margins sharp.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift.
Large left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with left to right subfalcine shift.
Numerous additional metastatic foci throughout the brain parenchyma may be further evaluated with MR of the brain without and with gadolinium.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 47 year old man with history of malignant melanoma with acute onset word finding difficulties at 7:30pm on the night of admission, found to have word finding aphasia with anomia for low frequency words and frequent semantic paraphasic errors as well as some subtle comprension difficulties, as well as a right facial droop and upgoing right toe.
Initial CT of the head revealed a large left frontal hemorrhage and multiple foci of metastatic disease.
An MRI was performed, and was read as follows: "FINDINGS: Multiple enhancing lesions are identified in the brain with an area of hemorrhage and enhancement in the left frontal lobe.
There is mass effect on the left lateral ventricle.
Enhancing lesions are seen in both cerebral hemispheres as well as in the left superior cerebellar region.
There is no midline shift noted.
No evidence of hydrocephalus or brain herniation is identified.
IMPRESSION: Left frontal lobe hemorrhage as seen on the CT of [**2177-9-18**] with an area of increased signal which could be secondary to enhancement.
Multiple enhancing lesions in both cerebral hemispheres and in the left superior cerebellar region consistent with clinical diagnosis of metastatic disease."
For further workup, a chest xray was performed which showed: "Post-radiation fibrosis in right upper lobe with otherwise grossly clear lungs."
An EEG was abnormal as follows: "This is an abnormal portable study obtained in wakefulness progressing to drowsiness due to the presence of frequent slowing over the left anterior quadrant broadly, suggesting subcortical dysfunction in this region.
There were no epileptiform discharges seen."
He was followed by neurosurgery, who did not feel that a resection was warranted, considering the number of metastatic lesions.
His clinical exam was monitored and showed improvment of word-finding and of his facial droop.
His exam at discharge showed improvement of naming of both low and high frequency objects, and an improved but not resolved right hemiparesis of the face, as well as some very mild pronator drift.
Tylenol No ASA or anticoagulants.
Disp:*120 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage Metastatic Melanoma, Brain metastases  Discharge Condition: stable, improved exam and symptoms   Discharge Instructions: return if new symptoms of speech or language problems, or weakness.
