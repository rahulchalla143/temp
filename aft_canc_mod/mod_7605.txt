The main portal vein is patent, but demonstrates persistent hepatofugal flow.
Visualized portions of the pancreas are within normal limits with the pancreatic head, uncinate process and tail non-visualized secondary to shadowing from overlying bowel gas.
There is a small amount of ascites seen in the right lower quadrant and perihepatic locations.
Representative images of the kidneys demonstrate no hydronephrosis.
No evidence of biliary obstruction.
Circumferential gallbladder wall thickening, stable from recent CT, which likely relates to underlying liver disease.

Mild dependent atelectasis is present on the left.
Multivessel coronary arterial disease is present.
A 1-cm saccular enhancing structure at the gastroesophageal junction (300A, 27 and 2, 8) likely represents a paraesophageal varix.
A small perihepatic ascites is present.
The remainder of the liver demonstrates no evidence of infarct.

Cirrhosis, splenomegaly, varices, and small ascites, consistent with portal hypertension.
TACE treated liver, without evidence of infarct.
Two subcentimeter hypoattenuating liver lesions within segments [**Doctor First Name 690**] and IVb, too small to fully characterize.
Additional known liver lesions are better depicted on preceding MRI dated [**2161-11-24**].
Small right pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis.
Remote right ninth and tenth chronic appearing posterior rib fractures.
HOSPITAL COURSE: # hepatic encephalopathy:  s/p selective segment VI and right lobar TACE [**2-15**] for hepatic carcinoma.
He became hypertensive at the the end of the procedure, thought to be due to pain with BP up to SBP 200, controlled with dilaudid, toradol for pain and hydralazine.
Slowly became obtunded and altered following the procedure.
non-contrast CT of liver done showed ethidiol in most of R hepatic lobe and additional mass, no extravasation.
Pt with persistent nausea/vomiting/pain post procedure and marked increase in transaminases and bilirubin and developed encephalopathy and hypoxia, see below.
C/f infection given pt was febrile to 101 on [**2-21**].
Source of infection unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) **] evidence of abscess or liver infarct on [**2162-2-20**] CT ab/pelvis.
No ascites to tap.
EEG did not show signs of epileptic activity.
Head CT stable without evidence of bleed.
MRI head was performed which showed only nonspecific signal abnormalities likely from small vessel ischemic disease, nothing acute.
It was felt this had been a toxic-metabolic encephalopathy likely [**12-17**] elevated ammonium levels.
Subsequently bilirubin went up to 10.8 and pt developed severe jaundice.
Pt did not complain of RUQ pain at this time but given elevated bili RUQ u/s obtained without evidence of obstruction.
# Hypoxia: Patient developed new O2 requirement on the floo following the TACE procedure with O2 sat down to 86% on RA -> 92% on 3L shovel mask.

c/f aspiration pneumonia as he also had a fever to 101.2.
Hypoxia resolved.
# Volume overload:  Likely combiniation of hepatic failure and IVF.
Most likely secondary to hepatic decompensation and poor synthetic function.
No schistocytes on smear.
# Hypernatremia: Likely secondary to decreased free water intake given mental status, as well as hypovolemia from diarrhea ([**12-17**] lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy).
# Fever: Source unclear, although concern for respiratory process given new hypoxia and O2 requirement in the context of high risk for aspiration.
# Hepatocellular carcinoma s/p TACE: s/p selective segment VI and right lobar TACE.
Patient had marked increase in transaminases and bili with development of hepatic encephalopathy as above.
# Thrombocytopenia: baseline 100s due to portal hypertension.
Pt without signs of active bleeding and it was felt appropriate to monitor; no transfusions were given.
# Patient will need Chem7 monitoring for the next 5 days to evaluate for hypokalemia or worsening renal function.

Unfortunately, the procedure was complicated by injury to the normal liver cells as well as the cancer cells which led you to have decompensation requiring intubation.
You were also found to have a pneumonia, for which you were treated with IV antibiotics.
We also had the nutritionist meet with you and your family to help you with your caloric intake and dietary choices.
