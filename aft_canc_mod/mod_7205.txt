She reports feeling well until the day of presentation when she started getting sharp epigastric pain which was not relieved by her PO dilaudid.
She also started feeling chills and had a temp of 100.7. .
CT abd/pelvis with contrast showed persistent enlargement of CBD and intrahepatic tree.
Her pain went from a 10 total 6 with the dilaudid.
She stated her pain was still at a [**7-9**].
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: ====================== Initially presented with abdominal pain to [**Hospital3 **],  had T. Bili of 24.
Abdominal CT and ultraound demonstarted a pancreatic mass obstructing the bile duct.
She underwent an EUS guided biopsy of her pancreatic mass on [**2149-4-17**]  showing adenocarcinoma.
Brother with cirrhosis (due to EtOH).

Cholangitis - frank pus in bile duct.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a balloon catheter and contrast medium was injected resulting in partial opacification.
A distal CBD stricture was noted with severe post-obstructive dilation.
However, post-obstructive dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts was appreciated.
Subsequent images demonstrate removal of both plastic and metal stents, and opacification of the biliary tree demonstrates narrowing of the CBD at its mid portion, with mild to moderate dilatation just above the area of stricture.
There is mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation as well.
Biliary Drainage from [**Month/Day/Year **] (Final [**2149-5-25**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is       performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.
Susceptibility will be performed on P.aeruginosa and       S.aureus if sparse growth or greater..   Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo woman w recently diagnosed inoperable pancreatic cancer thought to be metastatic to the liver s/p recent [**Month/Day/Year **] and placement of metal stent for enterococcal cholangitis complicated by septic shock who presented with fevers, increased WBC, RUQ pain, and jaundice along with a CT of the abdomen showing significant enlargement of CBD and intrahepatic biliary tree.
# Cholangitis.
Throughout her stay, the patient experienced repeated episodes of cholangitis stemming from stent migration and compression from her known pancreatic mass.
She eventually defervesced on this regimen and remained afebrile for 2 days on an oral regimen of levofloxacin, flagyl and fluconazole prior to discharge.
While afebrile and pain-free, her bili continued to again trend upward.
As she was afebrile and pain free, she was discharged on levo, flagyl and fluconazole to be continued indefinately.
Pancreatic cancer.
The patient was noted to have multiple liver lesions which were thought to be either abscesses or metastatic disease.
These lesions were further discussed with radiology who reviewed multiple recent abdominal imaging studies.
After review, it was thought that the lesions were almost certainly metastatic in nature.
The patient was presented with the option of aspirating one of these lesions for diagnostic purposes but, as she expressed the desire to avoid any further discomfort for procedures that had a low likelihood of altering her disease course, she declined aspiration.
Consistent with the belief that these lesions were metastatic, the patient began to develop worsening liver function with INR [**3-4**] refractory to vitamin k repletion.
Given her elevated bili and worsening liver function, she was not a candidate for gemcitabine or alternative chemotherapy regimens.
# Pain control.
The patient's pain was well controlled while in the hospital.
She was also given a script for morphine oral solution and anti-emetics should she develop worsening pain, the inability to take POs or nausea.
# Acute Renal Failure.
Bland urine sediment.
Thought most likely to be a result of contrast-induced nephropathy.
# SIADH.
The patient was hyponatremic with relatively elevated urine osms and urine sodium.
# Nicotine abuse.

Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital because of fever and abdominal pain.
You had multiple ERCPs to relieve the obstruction in the ducts that drain your liver.
Despite this, your labs remained abnormal and suggested ongoing, worsening liver disease.
There was concern that continuing to try to reverse this process would be largely unsuccessful and result in more pain and suffering for you.
You should take stool softeners to prevent constipation while on pain medications.
You should continue to take salt tabs and limit your fluid intake if you are able to prevent your sodium from dropping too low.
