Her WBC was 0.3 with no neutrophils or bands.

No cortical fragmentation to suggest osteomyelitis.
MRI of L elbow: MR LEFT ELBOW WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a moderate elbow joint effusion.
There is circumferential edema within the subcutaneous tissues about the elbow.
There is fluid signal intensity in the region of the olecranon bursa, suggestive of bursitis.
It is not clear if this represents dense edema or frank fluid, as this study is limited without intravenous contrast.
Also noted is diffuse increased signal intensity within the musculature about the elbow, suggestive of myositis.
Moderate elbow joint effusion.
Diffuse increased signal intensity within the musculature about the elbow, consistent with nonmyositis.
Edema within the subcutaneous tissues about the elbow, suggestive of cellulitis.
CT OF THE CHEST: There are no significant axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
There is a small hypodense area in the left lobe of the thyroid measuring 1.2 x 0.8 cm.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is no evidence of aortic dissection.
There is fluid in the pericardial recess anterior to the aorta, which is unchanged when compared to prior study.
There are no filling defects in the pulmonary artery branches.
There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
There are subsegmental atelectasis in the right middle lobe and lower lobes.
There are emphysematous changes in the lungs.
There is a patchy ground-glass opacity in the left upper lobe near the apex that is new when compared to the prior study and of unclear significance.
There are no pleural effusions.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Subsegmental atelectasis.
Small patchy ground-glass opacity in the left apex of unknown clinical significance.

BCX [**2156-9-19**]: No growth (final) BCX [**2156-9-20**]: No growth (final)   Brief Hospital Course: This is a 61-year-old woman with glioblastoma multiforme, s/p involved-field XRT, surgery, involved-field cranial irradiation, and chemotherapy presented with  neutropenic fever, left elbow bursitis/cellulitis, UTI, and possible pneumonia on chest CT.  1.
Neutropenic Fever/Hypotension:  In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated, and her blood pressure responded without any pressor.
Sources of infection included left elbow bursitis/cellulitis, pneumonia, and UTI.
In the setting of neutropenic fever, the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, ceftazidime, and azithromycin (for atypical pneumonia), as well as gentamicin x 1 dose in context of continued destabilization and need for double gram negative coverage.
Orthopedics was consulted for her left elbow bursitis/cellulitis.
Orthopedics felt that possible bursitis; however, symptoms improved with antibiotics.
On transfer to the OMED service, the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
Also, on [**2156-9-26**], the left elbow had increased warmth and erythema as well as enlargement of fluid sac.
Also, patient's WBC increased despite the discontinuation of Neupogen was disproportionately high with a presence of dohl bodies and toxic granulations on smears suggestive of undertreated or persistant infection.
CXR showed small bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
Transaminitis: She had elevated AST and ALT from [**2156-7-12**].
Vancomycin 1,000 mg Recon Soln Sig: One (1) gm Intravenous  Q 12H (Every 12 Hours) as needed for for cellulitis/bursitis for 10 days.
Discharge Instructions: Return to the emergency department or call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] if you develop fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, worsening pain or redness in your left elbow, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symtpoms.
