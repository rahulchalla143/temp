Pt originally presented to [**Hospital3 **] [**2102-11-27**] with wheezing, so chest CT was obtained showing right hilar 3 cm mass encasing bronchus.
1 month ago he c/o complaining of left lower extremity weakness.
A head MR showed multiple ring-enhancing lesions and he was eventually diagnosed with metastatic lung Ca.
CXR and chest CT showed right upper lobe mass.
Bronch performed [**2103-2-13**] at [**Hospital 17065**] Hospital showed 3cm lesion encasing right hilar bronchus.
He received total brain irradiation, but he found not to be a candidate for chemotherapy due to extensive disease.
No F/C/N/V/CP.
While in the [**Name (NI) **], pt became hypotensive.
Pt reported CP, ECG showed new V2-V6 ST depressions, has VT arrest.
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: T 98.7, BP 106/53 HR 61-66 RR 23 AC 500*18, 100% PEEP 5 Gen: Intubated, sedated Pulm: CTAB CV: distant RRR no murmurs Abd: + BS, soft, ND, no guarding, no HSM Extr: No [**Location (un) **]  Pertinent Results: MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**2103-3-9**]: A total of 6 ring enhancing lesions seen throughout the cerebral hemipheres and a 7th ring enhancing lesion either centered within the meninges overlying the right parietal lobe or within the adjacent bone.
MR C/T/L Spine [**2103-3-9**]: 1) Cervicothoracic imaging reveals no evidence of bony metastases or cord impingement.
No abnormal intraspinal enhancement is seen.
2) Lumbosacral spine imaging demonstrates normal vertebrae and no abnormal enhancement to indicate metastatic infiltration.
2) Questionable increased right perihilar opacities on the right side could represent early pneumonia or aspiration.
CT head [**2103-4-4**] 1) Multiple cerebral metastases as seen in the prior MRI from [**2103-3-8**].
2) There is a hyperdense area in the right parietal region that suggest a small acute hemorrhage.
3) Questionable hyperdense area around the left parietal mass could represent hemorrhage.
However, the patient had a small amount of hemorrhage around this area on [**2103-3-8**].
4) Increased extra-axial space in the left frontal lobe.
These were then stopped, after discussion with family, as pt has end stage metastatic lung cancer.
Aspirin and heparin were avoided due to intracranial bleed.
2) Lung Ca: No treatment for primary nodule.
Dexamethasone taper  Discharge Medications: 1. roxinol 20mg/mL  Sig: 5-20 mg  q1-3hours as needed for shortness of breath, pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Hospice House  Discharge Diagnosis: metastatic lung cancer history of MI   Discharge Condition: to hospice, in stable condition, off pressors  Discharge Instructions: Please tell the staff if you feel short of breath or uncomfortable  Followup Instructions: Please follow up with your primary care doctor as needed.
