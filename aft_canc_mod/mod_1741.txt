CXR [**2165-8-25**]: FINDINGS: Consistent with the given history, there has been interval development of bilateral pleural effusions left much larger than right.
There is diffuse engorgement of the vascular pedicle and indistinctness of the cephalized vascular flow.
Findings suggest superimposed volume overload in addition to the bilateral pleural effusions.
The aorta remains markedly tortuous though incompletely evaluated given the large left effusion.
Deformities of multiple left posterolateral ribs are stable.
IMPRESSION: Interval development of bilateral pleural effusions left much larger than right.
There is superimposed pulmonary edema as well.
CXR [**8-28**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**8-26**], the left Pleurx catheter remains in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax or recurrent effusions.
Small right effusion persists.
Continued prominence of indistinct pulmonary vessels, consistent with some elevation in pulmonary venous pressure.
Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the aorta persists, as well as multiple surgical clips in the axillary regions bilaterally.

# UTI -  The patient was found to have E Coli growing in her urine.
Oncology - Breast cancer s/p lumpectomy and node dissection on each breast on 2 different occasions.
# Hypothyroid: Patient's TSH was found to be high.
