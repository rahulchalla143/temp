Mitral valve prolapse.
Lower extremity edema times two months.
Status post right lymphoma excision, right arm, [**2131**].
ALLERGIES:   She had no known drug allergies.
Her neck was supple; she had no jugular venous distention.
No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly and no carotid bruits.
She had decreased breath sounds slightly on the right side, but her lungs were clear bilaterally and without any wheezing.
Heart was a regular rate and rhythm; she has an S1, S2, and she had a Grade III/IV systolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border and left sternal border which radiated to the second ICS.
She had bilateral varicosities.
LABORATORY:  Prior to admission, her catheterization showed normal coronaries with two plus mitral regurgitation and an ejection fraction of 60% as well as ascending aortic aneurysm, which had been found incidentally, preoperatively, on TTE.
Preoperative chest x-ray showed no evidence of a pneumonia or heart failure.
HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  On [**10-28**], the patient underwent a Bentall procedure with aortic homograft as well as aortic Dacron graft and a coronary artery bypass grafting times one with a vein graft to the right coronary artery by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**].
On postoperative day one, the patient did have an episode of ventricular tachycardia in the Operating Room the prior evening.
The patient remained intubated at that time with plans to wean to extubate and have the Propofol turned down as the patient was being sedated.
Abdomen was slightly distended.
On postoperative day three, the patient had some complaints of shortness of breath in the sub-xiphoid area, had a temperature maximum of 99.2 F., was maintaining good blood pressure and saturating 94% on four liters.
Chest tubes remained in place for an increased output since midnight the day prior.
The patient had bibasilar crackles with some poor respiratory excursion.
Heart was regular in rate and rhythm; no murmur, no jugular venous distention.
Extremities had no edema.
Chest x-ray showed no congestive heart failure, but had stable effusions bilaterally.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with no ST or T wave changes or ischemia.
On postoperative day four, the patient still had occasional shortness of breath and received some nebulizers.
There were decreased breath sounds bilaterally with occasional crackles, and no edema peripherally.
On postoperative day five, the patient was feeling improved with decreased shortness of breath and pain under control.
Still had bilaterally occasional crackles but the sternum was stable.
She denied hitting her head or pain or discomfort from her fall.
On postoperative day seven, the patient had no complaints; her shortness of breath was improved.
The patient had some new inferior wound erythema at the staples on the sternal incision with no drainage.
Extremities had no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
The patient continued to improve and was ambulating and having pulmonary toilet.
The patient continued also to receive nebulizer for part of that pulmonary regimen.
Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] complained of some vision changes on the 10th.
She had some complaints to nursing about the way "her eyes were working".
The patient was complaining of blurry vision which had been getting a little bit worse and Neurology made some recommendations, and an MRI study was ordered.
The attending Neurologist noted that this was possibly an old lesion in mid-brain or thalamus and it may be related to stroke, but was too small to be seen on MRI.
The patient did have occasional tachy dysrhythmias over 36 hours with scant drainage from the inferior margin of her sternum with mild erythema around her staples but her sternum was stable.
The patient did have an episode of atrial fibrillation.
At this point there was a question whether or not this was a posterior circulation cerebrovascular accident.
Inferior aspect had some erythema with very scant yellow exudate.
Right thigh incision was okay.
Left groin incision had some mild erythema with no exudate.
Again, the patient did continue to have a postoperative supra-nuclear upward gaze, question of a palsy, but this was not seen definitively on the MRI/MRA.
The patient was seen by Neuro-Ophthalmology on the 14th prior to discharge, who noted that this palsy was most likely reflective of a pontine hypoperfusion injury secondary to this difficult surgical procedure that she had.
Rheumatoid arthritis, fingers.
Porphyria with q. six months phlebotomy.
Status post abnormal ocular gaze with a question of pontine injury; final results on MRI.
