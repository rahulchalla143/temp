At worst the abdominal pain was [**6-14**] and was worse with bumps in car ride to ED.
He also notes increased lethargy over the past few days.
He has had softer/loose brown stool; denies black stool or BRBPR.
Reports chronic, intermittent diarrhea x many years, however noted 4 loose stools (more frequent than normal during these episodes).
Has noted perhaps slightly increased abdominal distention, but no significant increase in LE edema from recent baseline.
Of note, he was hospitalized [**Date range (1) 24439**] for CHF and hct drop at which time EGD was performed showing grade 2 varices which were banded.
He had guaiac positive brown stool.
CT abd/pelvis was performed which showed moderate loculated ascitic fluid without other clear bowel pathology.
He also received zofran 4mg IV x1 for nausea after NGL.
No HA/changes in vision.
No joint pain.

Physical Exam: VS: Temp: 97.2 BP: 85/48 HR: 90 a.fib RR: 19 O2sat 99% RA GEN: pleasant, comfortable, NAD HEENT: Left pupul 3->2.5mm, right pupil 2.5->2mm, EOMI, + scleral icterus, MM dry, OP without lesions NECK: no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy appreciated, no jvd, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules RESP: no increased WOB, bibasilar rales L>R ([**Date range (1) 5082**] up on left), no rhonchi nor wheezes CV: irregularly irregular, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g appreciated ABD: +mild distention, +b/s, soft, mildly tender mid abdomen just superior to umbilicus, + hepatosplenomegaly, no rebound/guarding EXT: [**3-10**]+ left lower extremity edema, 2+right lower extremity edema (reports asymmetry as chronic), warm, good pulses SKIN: no rashes, +jaundice NEURO: AAOx3.
[**2109-1-23**] CXR: Wet read: Pleural plaques, bilateral haziness and cephalization c/w pulmonary edema vs. overlying pleural disease.
Increasing ascites within the abdomen, layering non-dependently with some areas of partial loculation and mild rim enhancement--these findings raise the possibility of peritonitis.
Stigmata of portal hypertension including splenomegaly, paraesophageal varices, and a large recanalized umbilical vein.
Poor visualization of the left hepatic lobe, left hepatic vein, and left portal vein.
Findings consistent with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
Moderate to large volume ascites.
No evidence of hematoma or intraperitoneal hemorrhage.
Stigmata of portal hypertension including splenomegaly, periesophageal varices, gastric varices, and large recanalized umbilical vein are unchanged.
[**2109-1-28**] EGD: Impression: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus Erythema in the gastroesophageal junction compatible with esophagitis Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum   Brief Hospital Course: 57 year old man with history of Alcoholic cirrhosis and portal hypertension with grade 2 varices status post banding in [**12-12**], CLL, diastolic CHF presents with increase in loose bowel movements and abdominal pain.
# Abdominal pain/spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: Due to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis given loculated ascites and peritoneal enhancement on CT, as well as diagnostic paracentesis demonstrating greater than 250 PMNs.
Peritoneal culture with no growth.
Patient was treated with levofloxacin with resolution of abdominal pain.
No more episodes of hypotension throughout hospital course.
# Alcohollic cirrhosis:   Patient with known alcoholic cirrhosis, with esophageal varices.
These were initially held due to hypotension above, but then were added back (although furosemide and nadolol added at lower dose that on admission).
Otherwise, treatement of SBP as above, and treatment of anemia as below.
Etiology of patient's anemia felt to be likely multifactorial - due to history of CLL, perhaps some low grade hemolysis (50% indirect bili, low haptoglobin, but normal LDH, and in setting of transfusions and cirrhosis, so difficult to interpret), as well as perhaps low grade bleed from esophageal varices.
EGD demonstrated non-bleeding varices, no intervention done.
# Acute renal failure: Creatinine 1.3 from previously normal baseline of 0.8-1.0.
# Rhythm: Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin.
As above, coumadin held on admission due to decreased Hct.
# Pump: Patient with known diastolic CHF, preserved EF followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in outpatient setting.
# CLL: Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2148**] as outpatient.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check CBC (including hematocrit), and INR (Please bring this lab slip with you to your doctor's office on Thursday, [**1-31**])   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis Anemia  Secondary: Cirrhosis Hypertension Diastolic Congestive Heart failure Atrial fibrillation on coumadin CLL Peptic Ulcer disease   Discharge Condition: Good.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain and found to have a spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (infection in the peritoneum of your abdomen).
You also had low blood counts requiring transfusions, and therefore underwent an endoscopy for further evaluation, which demonstrated non bleeding esophageal varices.
- We have also discontinued your aspirin due to your bleeding for now - this will be re-addressed by your physician after discharge -  We also have discontinued your digoxin due to your low blood pressure - this will be re-addressed by your physician after discharge as well.
At this visit, you will need to have your blood counts checked.
