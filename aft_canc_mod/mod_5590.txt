Admission Date:  [**2176-10-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2176-11-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2109-5-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ampicillin / Penicillins / Bactrim / Lisinopril / Shellfish  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath with Increased Oxygen Requirement  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
History of Present Illness: Briefly, patient is 67 year old female with known history of sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma and sarcoidosis, who presents to the hospital for worsening shortness of breath and increased oxygen demand.
She had no other symptoms at that time--no [**First Name3 (LF) **], fever, chills, night sweats, chest pain, palpitations.
Patient reported one episode of diarrhea one week ago.
No PND, orthopnea, no weight changes.
No increase in abdominal girth.
No bone or joint pain, skin changes, rashes.
Asthma 2.
HTN 3.
Osteopenia 4.
Hypercholesterolemia 5.
History of elevated calcium 7.
History of steroid induced hyperglycemia 9.
Sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma, s/p L hemicolectomy with stapled colorectal anastomosis [**2175-6-9**]: mucinous adenocarcinoma (>50%) which was pT3, pN2 and M1 (stage IV) with metastatic disease to omentum and peritoneal implants.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Tm/c 100.5, BP 128/72 P 97 RR 18 sats 94% on 4l General: Pleasant female appearing stated age, resting in bed comfortably, in no apparent distress Neck: Supple, no jvd, no LAD Cardiac: RRR, nl S1, S2, no m/r/g Lungs: good air entry and movement, scattered bilateral mild rhonchi, no wheezes, rales, no dullness to percussion Abdomen: soft, NT, ND, +BS, no HSM appreciated.
Extr: trace edema bilaterally, no clubbing/cyanosis Neuro: A&Ox3, no focal findings Psych: Appropriate  Pertinent Results: CXR: Diffuse fibrotic changes secondary to sarcoid without superimposed acute cardiopulmonary process.
No lesions worrisome for metastatic spread.
New, diffuse ground-glass opacities with multifocal areas of more confluent opacities.
Findings are non-specific and diagnostic considerations include pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, or possibly infection.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Fibrosis, traction bronchiectasis, hilar and paraaortic lymph nodes consistent with known sarcoidosis again seen, not significantly changed from prior.
Evidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for review) of [**2174-2-21**], moderate pulmonary hypertension is now evident.
The tricuspid regurgitation is increased.
ADMISSION LABS:  Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo female with pulmonary sarcoidosis, and known history of stage IV sigmoid colon [**Hospital 97993**] transferred from oncology floor for CPAP due to hypoxia and increased carbon dioxide by ABG.
1) Respiratory Distress .
Patient was admitted for respiratory distress and hypoxia.
She received a CTA out of concern for pulmonary embolism.
The CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism, but demonstrated bilateral focal area of ground glass opacification.
Patient low grade temperature on arrival to floor, and given CTA findings the oncology team initiated coverage for community acquired and atypical PNA.
Echo showed no signs of heart failure or strained right ventricle, therefore, heart failure was not thought to be a significant contributing factor.
The patient's respiratory status did not improve and she spiked a temperature > 101.
The patient continued to have respiratory decline on [**10-10**] 9.32/75/51, then [**10-11**] 7.27/82/82.
MICU was called to evaluate and the patient was felt to have increasing mental confusion, increased fatigue, increased work of breathing, tachypnea (to 40s) and increasing hypercarbia.
Upon Arrival to MICU, patient was placed on CPAP with no appreciable change in mental status, but slight decrease in tachypnea to 30s.
Patient was intubated for hypercarbia.
MICU reviewed patient's rapid decline in pulmonary status and felt it was likely due to infection vs congestive heart failure vs pneumonitis based on new bilateral ground glass opacity by CT.
Unlikely congestive heart failure as patient with nl ECHO, no signs of RV overload, only moderate pulm HTN, proBNP 1214.
Irinotecan can cause interstitial lung disease, last dose was [**9-24**]; however, more concerned that fever, new infilatate represents pulmonary infection.
Initial concern for ARDS as pt initally required high platuea pressures > 30; however, ARDSnet protocol was started and tidal volumes decreased.
She continued her home medication of revatio for pulmonary hypertension.
#) Acute Renal Failure: Patient developed acute renal failure, thought to be secondary to hypotension as well as potentially nephrotoxic medeications.
#) Small bowel obstruction: Patient noted crampy abdominal pain at time of her irinotecan treatment, with much dirrahea.
It was felt that her abdominal pain was likely secondary to chemotherapy effect initially, however then was unable to pass any flatus and had no bowel movements, with increasing distention.
Imaging at that time was consistent with a small bowel obstruction.
Sugery was consulted and every attempt was made to manage her small bowel obstruction conservatively.
She received TPN during the time she was kept NPO, and morphine was used for pain control.
#) Hypertension: Patient was noted to have widely flucuating blood pressures, depending on whether she was in pain or had intravenous fluids running.
She was discharged on nifedipime 30 mg daily; metoprolol was held due to persistently low blood pressure.
#) Hyperglycemia: Patient had elevated blood sugars in setting of likely infection as well as steroids used for respiratory distress and chemotherapy.
#) Anemia: Patient's baseline HCT was 30-32, and she was noted to have worsening of her chronic anemia while hospitalized.
- Patient received red blood cell transfusions for her anemia while hospitalized.
She was cleared by physical therapy for a safe return to her home, and was ambulating without difficulty.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: - Pneumonia Secondary Diagnoses: - Small bowel obstruction - Pulmonary Sarcoidosis - Sigmoid adenocarcinoma - Pulmonary hypertension - Anemia   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Ambulating safely, seen by physical therapy and determined to be safe for discharge.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted due to worsening shortness of breath, increasing need for oxygen, and fevers.
It was thought that you likely had an infection and that was the cause of your increased oxygen, and you were supported by intubation, on a ventilator, and monitored closely in the intensive care unit.
You also were given your chemotherapy for your cancer while you were admitted.
You developed a bowel obstruction, which resolved with medical management.
