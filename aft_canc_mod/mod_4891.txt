Admission Date:  [**2107-7-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-8-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2029-5-17**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Food Extracts  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 473**] Chief Complaint: Distal cholangiocarcinoma versus pancreatic adenocarcinoma Obstructive jaundice.
M presenting with 3 wks of painless jaundice, loss of appetite and weight loss.
Past Medical History: HCV, Dislipidemia, COPD, Arthritis/Gout, Type 2 DM, Gastritis, pernicious anemia   Social History: Married  Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: On Admission: Vitals-98.3  70  130/70  15  1004Lnc Gen-Axox3, NAD, jaundiced RRR, no MRG CTABL Abdomen-soft, mildly tender to epigastric palpation, PTBD in place draining dark green fluid.
The pancreatic duct was filled partially with contrast and appeared normal The distal most part of the CBD was filled with contrast and there was a tight 1cm malignant appearing stricture Cannulation of the CBD was not successful using a sphincterotome  A small pre-cut sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a needle-knife to aid in accessing the CBD Cannulation of the pancreatic duct was performed with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique A 6cm by 5FR plastic single pigtail pancreatic stent was placed successfully to aid in CBD cannulation and decrease risk of acute pancreatitis.
Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram demonstrating dilated right and left intrahepatic biliary ducts and dilated common bile duct.
A complete obstruction of the distal CBD was noted and attempts to cross into the bowel were unsuccessful at this stage.
24 mm mass in the pancreatic head/ampullary region which appears to be confined to the pancreas except possible extension in to the duodenal wall and slightly into the pancreaticoduodenal groove.
This most likely represents a pancreatic adenocarcinoma, but amopullary carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma are possible.
Replaced right hepatic artery otherwise conventional hepatic arterial and venous anatomy with widely patent SMA, SMV, and portal veins, without evidence of vascular involvement.
No definite lymphadenopathy.
Pancreatic stent in expected position without pancreatic duct dilation snd percutaneous transhepatic biliary catheter with tip in the CHD with no bile duct dilation.
4.8-cm slightly complex cyst in the left kidney.
[**2107-7-31**] ECG: Sinus rhythm.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
[**2107-8-1**] EGD: No evidence of active bleeding and no evidence of hemobilia.
Small pigmented area over ulcer at ampulla, which is a possible site of intermittent bleeding.
Check cholangiogram demonstrating decompression of the biliary ductal system as compared to the prior study dated [**2107-7-29**].
However, there is high grade stenosis noted in the terminal CBD with trickle of contrast flowing into the distal bowel.
These changes are non-specific but myocardial ischemia is not excluded as an etiology.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2107-8-16**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is       performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.
Susceptibility will be performed on P.aeruginosa and       S.aureus if sparse growth or greater..       PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA.
SENSITIVITIES: MIC expressed in MCG/ML  _________________________________________________________                              PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA                              | CEFEPIME--------------     4 S CEFTAZIDIME-----------     4 S CIPROFLOXACIN---------<=0.25 S GENTAMICIN------------   <=1 S MEROPENEM-------------   0.5 S PIPERACILLIN/TAZO-----    16 S TOBRAMYCIN------------   <=1 S     ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient with history of painless jaundice x 3 weeks was admitted to the General Surgical Service for evaluation and treatment.
After procedure, the patient arrived on the floor and was started on regular diet, on IV fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter (placed by Urology), and IV Dilaudid for pain control.
On [**2107-7-30**] patient underwent CTA, which demonstrated 24 mm mass in the pancreatic head/ampullary region with possible extent ion into duodenal wall.
Patient was evaluated for possible Whipple/bypass resection.
Pain was controlled with IV Dilaudid with good result.
Patient was on baseline mental status until [**2107-8-1**], where overnight patient became extremely agitated, required Haldol and four point restraints.
On [**2107-8-11**] patient was triggered for tachycardia, became unresponsive and was transferred in ICU.
CV: During admission patient had several episodes of sinus tachycardia.
Patient's cultures were sent and came back positive for Pseudomonas Aeruginosa in bile and blood.
WBC and fever curve were closely monitored during hospitalization, patient had WBC of 29 on transfer in the ICU.
Hematology: Patient was found to have bloody diarrhea on [**7-31**] x 2 and small hematemesis.
EGD was performed and found no active bleeding.
GI was consulted for colonoscopy, no colonoscopy was performed due to patient's status improved and HCT was stable.
Patient was in ICU for acute mental status change, his HCT dropped from 31.4 to 18.
No further interventions were made, patient was started on [**Name (NI) 3225**] protocol and expired on [**2107-8-16**].
