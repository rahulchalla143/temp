Admission Date:  [**2144-1-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-3-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2081-1-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Cefepime  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: fever/chills  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: Pt is a 63 yo male with a h/o Type II DM, CAD s/p 4v CABG [**2129**] and Ulcerative Colitis who p/w fever/chills/NS/weight loss and enlarging peri-portal lymph nodes on abdominal CT concerning for a new diagnosis of lymphoma.
Pt was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 19970**]/07 for abdominal pain, fevers, and weight loss of 20 pounds in the last year, and in the work-up was found to have multiple enlarging lymph nodes on abdominal CT, the largest being a 1.6cm peri-portal LN.
Pt was discharged [**1-11**] and saw Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 572**] in GI on [**1-13**], who felt the LAD was less likely infection, and more likely lymphoma, especially if the fever persisted on antibiotics.
Of note, pt was also admitted from [**Date range (1) 19971**] for hyperglycemia to 900s, thought to be [**2-7**] non-compliance with insulin [**2-7**] low PO intake [**2-7**] N/V thought to be [**2-7**] diabetic gastroparesis.
Currently pt has no pain at rest.
The pain is non-radiating, feels like a pressure and is worse with inspiration.
The pain and coughing was very intense overnight, which brought him into the ED this AM.
He also notes occasional epigastric discomfort that is also not related to food/position/chest pain/fevers that he has also had for weeks but goes away on its own.

Pulmonary lymphoma is less likely given the rapid development of these findings.
Bm Bx [**1-20**]: Morphologic features of a lymphoma, infectious process, or a myelodysplastic syndrome are not seen.
A lymph node biopsy, however, demonstrated focal infiltration by ALK-1 POSITIVE ANAPLASTIC LARGE T CELL (CD30+, CD4+, CD3+/-) LYMPHOMA.
Immunostains in the bone marrow to rule out minimal involvement by lymphoma are in progress and will be reported in an addendum.In summary the morphologic and immunophenotypic findings combined, are consistent with focal nodal infiltration by an anaplastic large cell lymphoma.
Lymph node bx:  In summary the morphologic and immunophenotypic findings combined, are consistent with focal nodal infiltration by an anaplastic large cell lymphoma.
No pulmonary embolism.
Unchanged abnormally enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, probably reactive to the consolidative changes in the lungs.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
CXR [**1-22**]: FINDINGS: Compared with [**2144-1-19**], there is now diffuse increase in pulmonary vascular and interstitial markings bilaterally, consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.
A superimposed small area of consolidation in the right mid lung field as well as in the retrocardiac left lower lobe could represent superimposed pneumonia.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls and of the distal septum.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Interval increase in moderate bilateral layering pleural effusions, and interval worsening of patchy consolidation and ground-glass opacity in the left upper lobe.
Stable chest and abdominal lymph nodes  Ct chest [**2-3**]:  Extensive coalescing peribronchial infiltration succeeding ground glass abnormality over six days might represent organizing viral pneumonia, perhaps fibrotic.
The rare diagnosis, acute interstitial pneumonitis is less likely because of rapid improvement.
Mediastinal lymph nodes are most likely reactive to the ongoing lung pathology, decreased since [**1-22**], now stable.
Interval decrease in moderate bilateral layering pleural effusions.
[**2-9**] head CT: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Moderate left frontal subgaleal hematoma  [**2-27**] pelvic MRI IMPRESSION: 1.
Large approximately 10-cm left lateral coronal fascia layering hemorrhage.
No acute fracture or evidence for AVN within the hips.
Discharge labs:   Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 63 yo male with a h/o Type II DM, CAD s/p 4v CABG [**2129**] and Ulcerative Colitis who p/w fever/chills/NS/weight loss and enlarging peri-portal lymph nodes on abdominal CT found to be positive for anaplastic T cell lymphoma hospital course c/b NSTEMI and heart failure as well as pneumonia.
PLAN: # Lymphadenopathy/fevers: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted for accelerated workup of lymphoma given his history of fevers, night sweats, and increasing lymphadenopathy.
The differential on admission included infectious vs neoplastic vs. inflammatory - constitutional symptoms and length of fevers point toward neoplastic, but admitted with evidence of PNA and gallstones, which are potential etiologies of infection.
A TEE was also done to rule out endocarditis which showed no evidence of vegetations.
On [**1-17**] a bone marrow biopsy was done given anemia and lymphopenia.
He had no palpable lymph nodes on exam.
The bx showed anaplastic T cell lymphoma.
A pulmonary consult was also obtained for possible transbronchial biopsy of lymph nodes on CT, but this was not done since the bx was revealing.
CTA was negative for PE, but showed a multilobar PNA.
He continued to have SOB and no improvement in his sats the following morning and was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency.
Second set of cardiac enzymes was positive for NSTEMI and he was started on heparin gtt.
He remained persistently febrile.
However, he continued to spike fevers despite adequate antibiotic coverage for CAP.
As the patient was ready to be transferred out of the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the final pathology returned from pathology and showed anaplastic lymphoma.
This prompted starting treatment for the lymphoma with CVP.
Adriamycin was not given because of the patient's heart failure.
The patient did not have any fever after starting treatment making it very clear that his fevers were [**2-7**] lymphoma.
# NSTEMI:  H/o CABG in [**2129**] however recent negative stress test.
An ECHO was performed which showed worsened wall motion abnormalities and overall worsened pump function.
Cardiology was consulted who recommended aspirin, heparin drip, increased beta blocker for tight HR control, 80 mg of QD statin, and diuresis as patient had been fluid positive.
Patient's symptoms improved.
Cardiology did not feel any need for intervention beyond medical management unless patient were to have recurrent symptoms and evidence of further ischemic evolution.
Once the patient was transferred back to the BMT service, cardiology was recalled to help [**Hospital Unit Name 4656**] the etiology of his heart failure.
They recommended a cardiac MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4656**] for an infiltrative process in addition to continuing aggressive medical management.
During this stay, the patient had a fall and developed a retroperitoneal bleed.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable and was chest pain free.
# Hypoxia: Covered appropriately for CAP, atypical PNA and healthcare-associated PNA.
Once back on the BMT service, a CXR was done which showed a worsening infection despite antibiotic treatment.
Out of concern that he was being inadequately treated Pulmonary was recalled for evaluation of hypoxia and worsening infiltrate.
They felt that his hypoxia was due to decompensated CHF and that the radiology would likely lag behind the treatment of infection.
A bronchoscopy was considered to obtain more tissue, however, as the patient had a recent NSTEMI, they felt that bronchoscopy would be a high risk procedure and would be of low yield.
They did not feel that he was a candidate for a sleep study in his present condition, however they recommended placing him on 2L O2 at night for presumptive sleep apnea.
On [**1-30**] the patient developed a rash which was likely related to Cefepime.
Flagyl was d/c'd after one week since no aspiration on video swallow and levaquin was continued for another week.
Patient did not have an O2 requirement upon leaving the hospital.
The patient continued to have lower extremity edema and likely needs further diuresis.
This dose may need to be adjusted to optimize volume status.
# DM: Severe and uncontrolled at home, associated with retinopathy, neuropathy, gastroparesis.
# Ulcerative colitis: He was asymptomatic for GI complaints throughout admission.
Thought unlikely to be causing fevers as high as 103.
This was initially thought to be due to intravascular depletion and NS was given.
Patient was diuresed for volume overload and was euvolemic.
Anaplastic lymphoma 2.
Pneumonia 3.
Hyponatremia 6.
HTN   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable and afebrile.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a work-up of your chronic fevers and were found to have anaplastic lymphoma and a pneumonia.
You were treated with antibiotics for the pneumonia and chemotherapy for the lymphoma.
In addition, you experienced a heart attack while you were in the hospital.
Please return to the hospital or call your doctor if you experience chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, fever > 101.4 or any other concerning symptoms.
In addition to discussion of you cardiac medications and your recent heart attack, please also discuss obtaining a cardiac MRI.
