For 1 week prior to admission, she recalls feeling very fatigued and had some mild shortness of breath as well.
Her poor intake started 3-4 days prior to admission, with vomiting starting 1 day ago.
She called EMS today because her fatigue was getting worse and her abdominal pain (different than her normal pancreatitis pain) was becoming more intense.
On her last [**Hospital 10701**] clinic visit, her progression of her CKD was felt to be secondary to significant diabetic involvement of her kidney.
She was also noted to have nephrotic range proteinuria and increased blood pressure.
They discussed the possible need of renal replacement therapy in the future with possibilities of kidney transplant or dialysis.
No pericardial rub on exam.
Abdominal pain much improved after 5mg of morphine.
Other labs are notable for acute on chronic renal failure with BUN/creat 126/9.1.
CXR was unremarkable and CT abdomen showed cholelithiasis in a distended GB but no apparent wall edema, pericholecystic fluid, or surrounding inflammation to suggest cholecystitis.
On arrival to the MICU, she is in some abdominal pain but conversant and with stable vital signs (normal BP).

Brief Hospital Course: 51 year old female with stage V CKD secondary to diabetic nephropathy/HTN with nephrotic range proteinuria presenting with acute on chronic renal failure likely secondary to hypovolemia.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Given her history of abdominal pain resulting in poor PO intake and ?coffee-ground emesis, she was likely hypovolemic.
Her elevated hematocrit likely represented hemoconcentration.
She had no indications for hemodialysis.
Her anioin gap of 28 closed and ABG showed improving acidemia with majority contribution likely from her renal failure with no appreciable lactate and urinalysis w/o ketones.
She was denying any dysuria, frequency or urgency.
Could be due to her CKD or possibly from an intrinsic renal process.
# Nausea/Abdominal pain: Possibly due to gastroparesis v. chronic pancreatitis.
She was given Metoclopromide PRN, Ondansetron PRN, lorazepam PRN for her nausea.
RUQ ultrasound showed no acute causes of abdominal pain.
Patient had a gastric emptying study which showed delayed gastric emptying.
She also commonly has worsening abdominal pain and nausea from her chronic pancreatitis in setting of acute illness.
On [**Date Range **], her nausea and pain were at basline while she was receiving PO metoclopramide before meals and compazine prn.
# Hypertension: Mildly hypotensive in the ED, likely secondary to volume depletion.
She became hypertensive over last few days of admission.
Amlodipine was restarted but Lisinopril was still held due to [**Last Name (un) **] for several days.
She was given labetalol 100mg prn for elevated blood pressure.
# Leukocytosis:  Etiology is possibly infectious vs. stress response.
UA was consistent with UTI (culture was contaminated).
Clinically she felt at her baseline without localizing symptoms and remained afebrile.
Will require repeat CBC as outpatient and if elevated further evaluation.
# Hyperphophatemia/Hypocalcemia: Patient with increasing hyperparathyroidism (232->373) over past month.
Secondary hyperparathyroidism from kidney failure.
Likely due to narcotic pain medications.
# Elevated Troponin: Elevation likely secondary to renal failure.
Initially, symptoms were thought to possibly be her possible abdominal anginal equivalent, but troponins remained elevated but decreased.
They were near her baseline with elevation likely from worsening renal failure.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # Diabetes mellitus: On insulin regimen as outpatient.
Patient was switched to 1/2 dose of [**Date Range **] while she had poor PO intake.
# Chronic pancreatitis/pain control: med regimen as above  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES -evaluate lower extremity edema - if worsening would restart her lasix and metolazone -recheck WBC count, if remains elevated will require further evaluation -Renal f/u for dialysis evaluation - will be seen by Renal on [**11-12**] -Will f/u with transplant surgery (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for placement of fistuala on [**11-11**]  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.

You came to the hospital with nausea, vomiting, and worsening kidney failure.
Your kidney failure was felt to be due to dehydration and it improved with us giving you fluids.
For your nausea and vomiting, we did a gastric emptying study and this showed some delayed gastric emptying with residual activity in the gastric antrum.
For your abdominal pain, we got an abdominal ultrasound that showed no acute findings that were thought to be responsible for your pain.
The kidney doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4221**] and they wanted to begin the process of readying you for dialysis so an AV fistula.
The kidney team and the surgeons decided it would be best for you to have the fistula placed after you leave the hospital.
On [**Last Name (Titles) **], your pain was much better, as was your nausea.
