[**9-9**] Wound tissue path: pending  [**9-9**] XR L foot: There is generalized demineralization with more prominent focal subchondral bone loss in the region of the fifth MP and talonavicular joints.
No discrete fracture or focal bone destruction although assessment limited by lack of localizing history.
Generalized soft tissue swelling particularly along the dorsum of the foot.
Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
Respiratory motion somewhat obscures details of the pulmonary vessels, but there probably is some continued elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
Retrocardiac opacification persists, consistent with atelectasis and probable pleural effusions.
s/p sacral decub debridement.
Found to have GNR bacteremia.
#Goals of care: Pt has a poor prognosis.
However, the patient does not want to be intubated or resuscitated, no pressors, no central or arterial lines.
[ ] Tobramycin trough 1hour prior to HD  #Sacral Decubitus: The patient had his sacral decubitis debrided by surgery.
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 39640**] for wound care are:  pressure ulcer care per guidelines turn and reposition q 2 hours and prn  waffle boots( off load heels )  Cleanse sacral pressure ulcer with 1/4 strength Dakins solution then rinse with saline ( discontinue after 4 days ) apply santyl to necrotic tissue in wound bed- rub in antifungal cream to periwound tissue pack wound with kerlix- barely moist.
cover with dry gauze then softsorb dressing secure with medipore H soft cloth tape change daily  If odor persists after 4 days, consider imaging - pt may require further surgical debridement as this is quicker method of debridement vs enzymes( santyl)  For left heel and ankle ulcers: adaptic to heel and dry gauze/abd pads to ankle to protect from potential trauma wrap with kerlix change daily  #Hypoxia/cough: Pt was admitted from rehab out of concern for aspiration.
#AMS: Has been waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] for a long time now, possibly worse now [**12-31**] infection and chronic illness.
His [**Month/Day/Year **] pressure tends to decrease during sessions, but this should not limit his ability to be dialyzed as he has been short of breath secondary to pulmonary edema.
Please continue to remove adequate amounts of fluid during hemodialysis (~2L).
#Chronic Pain: Pt was started on Methadone 7.5mg PO TID with Dilaudid for breakthrough pain.
Coumadin was discontinued on prior admission due to poor overall prognosis.
#SOB: Pt with an episode of shortness of breath during admission, likely [**12-31**] to pulmonary edema.
