Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: subtotal Pancreatectomy with Splenectomy Lysis Of Adhesions Open Wedge Liver Biopsy Small Bowel Resection   History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 14893**] is a 61-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, one of which is chronic abdominal pain.
She had some type of surgery for a cystic lesion in her pancreas several years ago which I think was on the basis of an incorrect diagnosis as a pancreatic pseudocyst.
She has persisted with this cystic neoplasm in her central pancreas which indicates that a pancreatic pseudocyst was not an accurate diagnosis.
We have no other reason for her abdominal pain.
She has had numerous issues in the past few months, perhaps the most significant of which was coronary artery disease necessitating coronary artery bypass grafting.
She also is morbidly obese and has had multiple prior abdominal operations.
As an attempt to eradicate her pain, I recommended resection of this pancreatic cystic neoplasm.

Her wicks were removed on POD 2. she had minimal drainage from the left side of her wound.
There was no erythema or infection.
Pain: She was having considerable pain post-operatively.
Given the pt's hx of chronic pain and chronic opioid use (was on Percocet (7.5mg), Vicodin, opana at home), she had increased requirements on pain medications.
She was initially tachypneic, and with asthma at baseline.
We were able to successfully wean her off the O2 and she had no respiratory issues.
