Admission Date:  [**2124-6-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2124-6-12**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Glyburide / Metformin / Tamsulosin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath.
History of Present Illness: 84 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, chronic atrial fibrillation presented from nursing home after being noted to be hypoxic to low 90's and after suctioning revealed some bloody secretions.
In the emergency department, the patient was in atrial fibrillation with RVR (rate 140) and in respiratory distress.
The patient also complained of abdominal pain in the left and right lower quadrants.
Cardiology was consulted for frequent NSVT and recommended heparin drip out of concern for pulmonary embolus.
The patient remained in respiratory distress and was intubated  prior to CTA given the inability to lay flat.
The patient had a difficult airway and required fiberoptic guidance for intubation.
The CTA was subsequently negative for PE but did show lower lobe infiltrates.
Surgery was consulted for the abdominal pain and recommended CT abdomen, which was unrevealing.
A diltiazem drip was attempted for control of RVR but the patient became hypotensive with this medication.
The patient remained in atrial fibrillation with rates 90-110.
The patient's antibiotics were changed to vanc/zosyn for treatment of pneumonia in this nursing home resident.
On transfer to the floor, he complained of cough occasionally productive of yellow sputum.
He denied shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal discomfort.
Chronic atrial fibrillation, no longer on coumadin secondary to fall risk 2.
Coronary artery disease 3.
Diabetes type II, diet controlled 4.
Hypertension 5.
Hypercholesterolemia 6.
Prostate Cancer 7.
Incidental thyroid nodule 10.
Status post multiple mechanical falls  Social History: Patient has been living in [**Hospital3 4634**] since last [**Month (only) 205**] and was at [**Hospital1 100**] Rehbilitation.
Family History: [**Name (NI) **] father had history of heart disease at unknown age, mother was healthy.
Heart sounds well audible  No murmurs appreciated.
horizontal incision noted.
No murmurs appreciated.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism, edema, pneumonia, or significant pleural effusion.
Bibasilar atelectasis, though superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
No definite consolidations are seen at this time.
No evidence of acute intra-abdominal pathology.
Increasing bibasilar airspace opacities are concerning for pneumonia and possibly aspiration.
Incidental note is made of multiple findings which are unchanged compared to [**2123-8-27**], including: large calcified gallstone, multiple renal cysts, pancreatic calcifications consistent with chronic pancreatitis, infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 4 cm, aneurysmal dilatation of bilateral iliac arteries, sigmoid diverticulosis, and an enlarged prostate gland.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mitral regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified (probably at least mild to moderate).
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
The presence of atrial thrombus cannot be adequately assessed by transthoracic echocardiography.
The patient is slightly rotated, which might explain the LLL haziness .
This might explain the left deviation of the NG tube .The lungs are otherwize clear No sizable pleural effusion is identified.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2124-6-8**] Gradual improvement in left lower lobe consolidation.
No new abnormality is detected.

Respiratory failure: Likely due to aspiration pneumonia in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
CTA negative for pulmonary embolus but showed lower lobe infiltrates.
The patient was intubated for hypoxia and for evidence of hemoptysis.
He underwent bronchoscopy which demonstrated diffuse friability with oozing from multiple sites.
The patient also had blood seeping down trachea from above and moderate tracheobronchiomalacia.
The patient was diuresed prior to admission with lasix but echocardiogram during admission showed no definite evidence of systolic or diastolic heart failure.
The patient was started on vancomycin and zosyn to complete a 14 day course for nosocomial pneumonia starting [**2124-6-5**].
The patient was given supportive care with standing xopenex and ipratropium nebulizers (albuterol was avoided given the history of tachycardia), oxygen as needed, and anti-tussives as needed.
Pt did have difficulty clearing his secretions and seemed to have some distress when coughing, because of this the pt was transferred to the MICU the day prior to discharge.
He was stable there with need for occasional suctioning.
The patient was evaluated by ENT given the difficulty passing OGT and NGT secondary to bleeding.
Echocardiogram was also unrevealing for a source.
Atrial fibrillation: The patient was seen by cardiology in the ED for rapid atrial fibrillation.
Rate control attempted with diltiazem, however, unsuccessful due to hypotension.
The patient has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation but is not anticoagulated at home secondary to multiple falls.
The patient's hematocrit drifted down during admission likely due to dilution.
The patient had no signs or symptoms of bleeding.
Baseline hematocrit is mid-to-high 30s, likely due to chronic disease.
The patient complained of abdominal pain on admission.
There were no concerning physical examination findings.
Imaging was negative for an acute process as above.
Coronary artery disease: No active issues during admission.
Tamsulosin was held for transient hypotension and to allow up-titration of beta-blocker for atrial fibrillation as above; this medication can be restarted as needed as an outpatient.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Lactulose 10 g/15 mL Syrup Sig: Fifteen (15) ML PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for constipation.
