He also had diffuse LUE sharp pain.
He denied parasthesias, numbness, saddle anesthesia, incontinence of bowel or bladder.
He endorsed some LLE weakness which is chronic and has not worsened recently.
He also has chronic left shoulder/neck pain.
He had a CT in ED which ruled out GI/biliary pathology but revealed near obliteration of T8 canal due to metastatic lesion with anterolateral cord displacement.
The patient was unable to tolerate MRI secondary to severe pain upon recumbency.

No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Interval increase in bony metastatic disease, especially notable for significant narrowing of the spinal canal at the T8 vertebral body level, and to a lesser degree the T1 vertebral body level.
Largely stable to slightly decreased size of multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules.
Interval worsening of metastatic involvement of the thoracic and lumbar spine with severe spinal canal narrowing and cord compression at T8 level and mild mass effect on the spinal cord at T2 level.
There are multiple metastatic lesions involving the ribs as described above.
Right pleural effusion.
Multiple metastatic lesions involving the visualized sacrum and iliac bones.
No new lesions or other areas with abnormal enhancement are identified.
Additionally there is a new mass lesion between the right petrous apex and the clivus, measuring approximately 14mm by 10mm in transverse dimensions, in close proximity with the right sixth cranial nerve and the right carotid canal(image #27, series #100a).
Brief Hospital Course: 45M hx metastatic RCC who presents with acute thoracic bandlike lancing pain centered in the RUQ and RLE upper motor neuron signs, CT thorax with T8 lesion that is nearly obliterating the cord.
#T8 cord compression: Has upper motor neuron signs on exam with radicular bandlike abdominal pain in the T8 area.
CT with concern for canal obliteration with anterolateral displacement of the cord.
Also T1 lesion which has narrowed the canal.
MRI T/L spine confirmed severe cord compression.
The patient was extremely claustrophobic and so required intubation for MRI.
His neurological exam was unchanged after laminectomy, with 8-10 beats of bilateral ankle clonus and lower extremity hyperreflexia.
Unfortunately due to a chronic cervical radiculopathy in his left shoulder, he often would refuse the majority of the neurologic exam.
After transfer back from the neurosurgical service (after laminectomy), he still complained of diplopia; at this time, he was noted to have a partial right abducens nerve palsy with diplopia when looking to the right.
The patient was reintubated for MRI of the brain, which showed a clivus bone metastatic lesion in the area of the right abducens nerve.
He will follow-up with rad/onc for further brain therapy for this metastatic lesion.
#Metastatic Renal Cell carcinoma: on sunitinib with disease progression.
Worsening metastatic disease (see above).
#Pain control: patient with high tolerance to opiates.
This was increased particularly for his left shoulder radicular pain.
