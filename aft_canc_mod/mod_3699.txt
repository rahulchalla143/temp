Pt is a transfer from OSH where CTA performed showed a large R.sided consolidation with b/l effusion R>L.
Due to BNP and CXR findings pt was given vanco/levo/ctx for PNA.
Otherwise denies headache/lh/dizziness/blurred vision/+palpit chronic, -abd pain/n/v/d/c/melena/brbpr, dysuria/hematuria, joint pain/skin rash, +poor po intake.
Reports sometimes difficulty with swallowing, unsure if chokes/coughs during eating.
Past Medical History: esophageal ca s/p esophagectomy [**8-5**], radiation+chemo weight loss HTN HL MI [**2109**] s/p CCY   Social History: He is married.
Family History: His mother is alive at age 88 with breathing difficulties and memory loss and heart problems.
He has a sister who died at age 61 of pancreatic cancer and a sister who is alive at age 54.
There is no other family history of breast, ovarian, uterine, or colon cancer.
neck: +JVP to thyroid cartilage, supple no LAD chest: b/l ae, poor effort, decreased breath sounds RML/RLL, also LLL.
ECHO [**12-24**]: Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2119-9-25**], anteroseptal hypokinesis with focal apical akinesis is now present.
Bilateral pleural effusions that are increased compared to [**2120-7-30**].
Compressive atelectasis of the right lower lobe with possible  superinfection.
Collapse of the distal esophagus and stomach, which precludes evaluation for mass.
No evidence of intra-abdominal fluid collection or abscess.
Interval loss of the subcutaneous fat plane in the left mid abdomen.
Moderate pleural effusions, left greater than right.
The left effusion is slightly smaller.
The right pleural effusion is unchanged with persistent loculation laterally.
Unchanged right lower lobe consolidation.
Specifically, evaluation for upper abdominal lymphadenopathy is suboptimal.
Thoracentesis: [**2120-12-30**] 12:37PM PLEURAL WBC-50* RBC-[**Numeric Identifier **]* Polys-6* Lymphs-83* Monos-10* Macro-1* [**2120-12-30**] 12:37PM PLEURAL TotProt-2.7 Glucose-84 LD(LDH)-84 Albumin-1.7 Pleural fluid cytology: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 65 year old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and esophageal ca s/p surgerical intervention/chemo/radiation, admitted to the ICU with SOB, fever, orthopnea.
#SOB/fever: CXR on admission with bibasilar opacities; left side noted to be chronic.
Also, difficult to track esophagus but still a question of fistula or obstruction.
Additionally, BNP elevated on admission and CHF was also considered (see below).
A thoracentesis was performed to alleviate some of his SOB/O2 requirement and assess for a malignant effusion.
Pleural fluid was negative for malignancy, but recurrence was still highly suspected with elevated CEA and continued weight loss.
#CAD- BNP elevated on admission.
ECHO showed interval change from previous with moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent).
#Esophageal ca:  Paitent reported extensive weight loss and diminished appetite.
Oncology was consulted; CEA noted to be elevated at 90.
# Nutrition: Speech and swallow felt he was too ill for inital evaluation.
He was made NPO for concern of aspiration risk.
# Acute likely systolic CHF: Patient with new diagnosis of CHF with pleural effusion and EF of 30%.
He was diuresed until his Cr elevated slightly, but his effusions remained.
# Anemia: Iron studies consistent with ACD .
# Goals of care: as noted above, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] discussed likelyhood of recurrence of cancer given elevated CEA and continued loss of appetite and weight.
Morphine Concentrate 20 mg/mL Solution [**Hospital1 **]: 10-20 mg PO Q1hrs as needed: for respiratory distress.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Last Name (un) 14710**] House (Hospice Home) - [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Aspiration Pneumonia weight loss Esophogeal cancer   Discharge Condition: Feeling well, on 3L O2, comfortable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because of shortness of breath.
While a tap of fluid around your lung did not show malignancy, we continue to suspect that you have a cancer recurrence.
After discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] about signs that indicate cancer recurrence, it was decided to shift goals of care to comfort oriented care.
You were given morphine as needed for SOB and other meds as needed for comfort.
Followup Instructions: Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 3280**] as needed for an appointment.
