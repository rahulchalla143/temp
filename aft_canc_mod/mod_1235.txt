line infxn vs. infected abdominal fluid collection.
However, fluid sterile.
Active issues here have been mania (psych involved), GIB (GI did EGD showing friable antrum as likely source, bxs consistent with chemical gastritis, but not neoplasm), fever of unclear source, and abdominal fluid collections.
Regarding her fluid collections, on admission here an abd CT showed fluid collection which was aspirated and found to be sterile.
Liver service was consulted for possible ascites, although liver felt that fluid was more likely related to renal failure vs. PTLD.
ID consulted [**4-27**] for persistent fever.

Complex linear lucency in the left supracondylar region, clinical correlation is requested.
this may represent a motion artifact, however fracture is a consideration if patient is symptomatic at that locale.
Stomach mass with gastrointestinal bleeding.
SURGICAL PROCEDURE:  Laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, drainage of intra-abdominal fluid collections, subtotal gastrectomy and repair of incisional hernia with mesh.
c.  Marked epithelial regenerative changes; focal accumulations of macrophages in the lamina propria.
Focal and mild chronic inactive gastritis.

Brief Hospital Course: 38 year old female with hx of ESRD secondary to Lithium toxicity, bipolar disorder, s/p renal tx failed due to PTLD, being transferred to medical service from surgical service for management of fever and GI bleeding (as well as pancytopenia, psych issues).
The pt was admitted on [**2202-4-9**] to [**Hospital **] with fever thought to be question of line infxn vs. infected abdominal fluid collection.
Active issues during this admission have been mania (psych involved), GIB (GI did EGD showing friable antrum as likely source, bxs consistent with chemical gastritis, but not neoplasm, ultimately had gastrectomy), fever of unclear source, and abdominal fluid collections.
Infected abd fluid also a possibility although previous aspirate is sterile.
Her cultures on this admission have all been negative, with multiple blood cultures.
# ESRD: Dialysis MWF but temporary access pulled because of low grade fevers.
CT scan [**4-22**] demonstrated a filling defect in the right greater saphenous [**Last Name (LF) 5703**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be due to prior surgery.
She had no new renal issues.
# ABD FLUID COLLECTION: unclear etiology: [**2-19**] to renal failure vs. PTLD vs. adhesions.
Not likely associated with liver dz per hepatology.
Also mid abd pigtail catheter with resolving small amt of fluid.
Cytology also neg for malignancy.
-- [**5-9**]: CT torso showed reaccumulation of fluid collection, not communicating with known ascites.
-- [**5-12**]: Reaspirate fluid collection and ascites sterile by gram stain and culture.
Cytology negative for malignancy.
# GI BLEED:  EGD on [**4-29**] shows diffuse erythema and congestion in stomach and mucosa is friable.
No sign of malignancy.
# ANEMIA: likely multifactorial with renal dz and GI bleed contributing.
Pt with erythroid dyspoesis on BM bx in [**1-24**].
Heme-Onc followed platelet count and did not have new recommendations from their perspective.
# THROMBOCYTOPENIA: low but relatively stable for the Pt.

# PTLD: cont home leucovorin  - h/o PTLD of transplanted kidney in [**2196**] diagnosed by EGD/Colonoscopy bx.
================================ ================================ ================================ Transferred to general surgery [**5-21**] for further management of the stomach mass with persistent GI bleeding, since no diagnosis could be made endoscopically along with the continued bleeding and possibility of malignancy, exploration was thought to be the best approach.
She underwent a laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, drainage of intra-abdominal fluid collections, subtotal gastrectomy and repair of incisional hernia with mesh.
She received a unit of blood and also several units of platelets because of a low platelet count.
She had no intra-operative complications, post-operatively she was NPO with intravenous hydration and Dilaudid PCA.
POD 7, diet advanced, continued with intermittent fever spikes to max 102.2.
POD 10, pain well controlled with oral Dilaudid, TPN stopped, tolerating a regular-renal diet; continues with daily low grade temps without clear etiology, Daptomycin to continue until [**6-16**] which would total 4 weeks of treatment.
Thrombocytopenia improved with platelets 113k at time of discharge.
Of note, the patient continued to have low-grade temperatures during this admission, with an unclear etiology.
