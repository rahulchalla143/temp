Admission Date:  [**2169-5-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2169-5-30**]  Date of Birth:   [**2101-2-11**]     Sex:  M  Service:  MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient was transferred from an outside hospital for a cardiac catheterization because he ruled in for a myocardial infarction.
He soon was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for dyspnea, hypoxia, tachypnea, and impending respiratory failure.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old man with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed in [**2168-11-13**].
Over the past few weeks, he noted increasing dyspnea such that he was unable to climb even a flight of stairs.
He also noted occasional mild left-sided chest pain for which he went to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2169-5-25**] where an EKG showed diffuse ST depressions and where he ruled in for myocardial infarction.
It showed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
Per the patient, there is a question of a lung nodule on a recent CT scan.
Neck:  JVP 7-8 cm, no palpable lymphadenopathy.
Chest:  Velcro-like crackles one-quarter up bilaterally, otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally with decreased air movement.
There was a hematoma in the left superior anterior chest.
There were chronic venostasis changes noted at the right ankle.
Chest x-ray on admission showed diffuse alveolar and reticular infiltrates bilaterally, greatest at the bases.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 68-year-old man with head and neck cancer diagnosed with three vessel coronary artery disease as well as myocardial infarction on admission to the hospital.
The tachypnea and dyspnea did not improve even with 2.5 liters of Lasix diuresis.
On [**2169-5-27**], he was noted to be in increased respiratory distress and thus was electively intubated.
It showed multiple nodules throughout the lungs as well as interstitial disease, especially at the bases.
There were diffuse ground glass opacities in both lungs.
This clinical picture at this time was consistent with respiratory failure secondary to likely a previously undiagnosed interstitial lung disease vs. progressive lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
He also developed hypotension and required Neo-Synephrine and two days later Vasopressin in order to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 60 mmHg.
He also ruled in for myocardial infarction again on [**2169-5-28**].
He was started on heparin on [**2169-5-29**] given the myocardial infarction with EKG changes in the inferior leads.
His oxygen saturation was difficult to maintain at 90% even with increasing his positive end-expiratory pressure.
Given these clinical findings, the overall impression was that his prognosis was very poor, especially given the interstitial lung disease seen on CT scan.
Given the patient's extremely poor prognosis, especially with the metastatic head and neck cancer, the interstitial lung disease, and the multiple myocardial infarctions, as well as other comorbidities, his family elected that he would be made comfort measures only on [**2169-5-30**].
Myocardial infarction times two.
Interstitial lung disease.
Respiratory failure requiring intubation.
