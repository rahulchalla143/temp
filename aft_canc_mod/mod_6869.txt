CT airway C/and C/O contrast on the 4th demonstrated a stent in the esophagus with extraluminal air and communications with central airways and a second stent to the right and adjacent to the esophageal stent.
The CT also revealed the known widespread intrathoracic metastatic disease including lymphangitic carcinomatosis and bilateral nodules, mediastinal infiltration, and a large right hilar mass.
Preoperative labs were significant for sinus tachycardia (pt placed on lopressor 2.5 mg IV q 6 hrs in SICU).
