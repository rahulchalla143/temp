History of Present Illness: 63 year-old male with follicular lymphoma who was recently discharged one week ago after being treated for L3 thecal sac compression who now presents with generalized weakness for one day prior to admission.
He had been well at rehab until he began to feel a generalized fatigue and weakness.
At the time, he denied any fever, chills, lightheadedness, chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting.
However, during transport, he became hypontensive to the 80's systolic, tachycardic to the 140's, and hypoxemic to the 70's.
He was diverted to [**Hospital1 3793**] and was found to have pneumonia on chest x-ray.
He also had an elevated lactate.
He was transfered to the Intensive care unit for further care given that he appeared septic since he was initially hypotensive with an elevated lactate.
Past Medical History: Past oncology history: He was diagnosed with low-grade follicular lymphoma in [**2168**] when he presented with a large right neck mass.
He was subsequently treated with Bexxar radiolabeled antibody and attained a complete remission for about 3 years.
In [**Month (only) 956**] [**2176**], he noted the gradual increase of his right neck mass, which showed follicular lymphoma on biopsy.
He was notd to have cervical spine involvement of imaging and was place in a soft cervical collar.
Follicular lymphoma as above 2.
Neuropathy secondary to chemotherapy 4.
Family History: His daughter died at age 20 of lymphoma (he believes ALL).
General:pleasant elderly gentleman wearing soft c-spine collar in no acute distress.
Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Pulmonary: Coarse breath sounds throughout with rhonchi at the bases, with left greater than right.
Abdomen: Normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly.
extremities: Warm and well perfused without cyanosis, trace edema at ankles.
Sputum (induced) 4+ yeast with pseudohypae Blood Culture ([**9-27**]) no growth Urine Culture ([**9-27**]) no growth .
CXR: Multifocal new patchy opacities.
While this might all represent atelectasis, differential diagnosis includes aspiration and infiltrate.
Bibasilar dependent consolidation.
Brief Hospital Course: 63 year-old male with recurrent follicular cell lymphoma with recent chemotherapy and radiation to L3 who was admitted for pneumonia and sepsis.
Pneumonia: On chest x-ray, he had evidence of pneumonia.
He improved on that regimen and his oxygen requirement decreased.
An induced sputum showed budding yeast and was negative for PCP.
His oxygen requirement decreased throughout his hospital course.
When he was tapered from 40 to 20 mg of prednisone, he had increased pain and lower extremity weakness.
He was maintain on his allopurinol and prophylactic Bactrim.
Anion gap acidosis: He initially had an anion gap acidosis that was likely secondary to lactate.
His anion gap acidosis resolved with fluid resuscitation.
Acute renal failure: On admission, his BUN and creatinine were elevated.
This was attributed to a pre-renal etiology in the setting of decreased perfusion from sepsis.
His iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease and his B12 and folate were normal.
His hematocrit dropped to 18 on hospital day 1, which was likely secondary to dilution from fluid resuscitation.
Hyperglycemia: He has no history of diabetes.
His elevated glucose was likely secondary to steroids.
Initially, he received IV fluid resuscitation for low blood pressure as above.
Nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for thrush.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: ArberJonice  Discharge Diagnosis: Pneumonia Lymphoma Acute renal failure Anion gap metabolic acidosis   Discharge Condition: Stable.
His oxygen requirement has decreased.
