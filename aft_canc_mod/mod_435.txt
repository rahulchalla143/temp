Renal cell carcinoma.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Sixty-year-old male with history of renal cell carcinoma with recent CT scan showing right subcranial/hilar mass 6.9 x 3.5 cm with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction and right lower lobe collapse presented on the admission date to Interventional Pulmonary for bronc.
The exact details were unknown, directly admitted for further work up, initially to the service at which point, he denied any nausea, vomiting, fever or chills, no increased shortness of breath except his increased cough, complained of rib cage diffuse pain and dry cough times two days which increased with rib pain and he also has noticed a loss of seventeen pounds in the past few months.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Lives with his wife, CEO of his own company, occasional alcohol, no tobacco.
Heart, decreased heart sounds, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
Lungs, very small breath sounds felt on the right side, especially basilar up to one-half up to the right side, left side with mild rales, mostly rales.
Abdomen, bowel sounds were present, mild hepatomegaly but nontender, nondistended abdomen.
Extremities, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Chest x-ray showed right lower lobe collapse/consolidation and large right pleural effusion questionably on preliminary.
HOSPITAL COURSE: His course was respiratory alkalosis, post-obstructive right lower lobe infiltrate with strep pneumo in two out of two blood cultures from admit.
He defervesced on Levofloxacin and Flagyl, persistent O2 requirement so sent to bronc on [**2106-5-10**], by IP and he is now since he has been sent to IP, he was status post removal of endobronchial lesion, right bronchus intermedius and post-procedure had respiratory distress requiring intubation, which he was sent to the MICU and since did okay post-extubation.
Since being admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] [**Hospital1 139**] team, he underwent another interventional pulmonary procedure, initially, it was planned on him questionably getting a stent done in place but the procedure was basically a similar procedure to the previous one, no stent was placed.
The patient tolerated the bronchoscopy well without any problems.
Prior to his discharge, he had an ultrasound done, which was with a questionable right sided effusions, which were found not to be effusions and mostly tissue and no need for tap at the time by IP service.
His acute renal failure that he presented on admission has resolved and he is now down to 0.7, it was thought to be probably most likely secondary to pre-renal state, given BUN and creatinine ratio close to 20 and also the patient being dry on examination.
The patient's pain medications controlling the patient's rib pain.
No acute new problems on discharge.
ID wise, his pneumococcal/pneumonia/CAP plus post-obstructive pneumonia was as noted, to continue his Levofloxacin and Flagyl since when he was taken off Flagyl and was taken to the unit from the, he required Clindamycin for a day and then he was taken off the Clindamycin but then when he was brought to the [**Hospital1 139**] service, he actually spiked a temperature.
With the elevated temperature and leukocytosis, it was felt that the patient could benefit from some anaerobic coverage.
The patient's elevated blood pressures resolved since and he was continued on the Levo-Flagyl for resumed post-obstructive pneumonia.
It is thought that his low hematocrit is probably secondary to decreased PO intake, nutritional problem and also could be related to his eighteen pound weight loss over the past few months.
In terms of his neurologic, per MRI on [**5-7**], there was no sign of cord compression from his metastases and there was plan of following up for XRT per Rad/Onc but Rad/Onc have decided for now that he is not a candidate for the time being and to be followed up by Oncology for further follow-up and possibly maybe later on become a candidate at Oncology and Rad/Onc's discretion.
He also has a tachycardia with ectopy, which has been pretty stable.
We repleted his electrolytes PRN and his tachycardia has remained sinus tachycardia since admission and on discharge date, he still continues with the mild tachycardia.
FINAL DIAGNOSES: Renal cell carcinoma, status post IP intervention times two with debridement.
Follow-up with PCP and primary oncologist as prescribed and the patient was sent to rehabilitation on the following medications, Neutra-Phos PRN and following his magnesium and phosphorous close, Trazodone 12.5 mg PO at bedtime, PRN, Codeine 15 mg IV every four to six hours PRN, Heparin subcutaneous every eight hours, 5,000 units, Metronidazole 500 mg PO every eight hours for fourteen more days and Pantoprazole 40 mg PO every twenty-four hours, Amlodipine 10 mg PO every day, Metoprolol 50 mg PO twice a day, Levofloxacin 500 mg PO every twenty-four hours for another twelve days, Docusate 200 mg PO twice a day, Senna one tablet PO twice a day, Oxycodone 5 mg PO every four to six hours PRN for pain and also continue on insulin sliding scale per protocol.
