Admission Date:  [**2161-8-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2161-8-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2085-9-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: abdominal and pelvic pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IVC Filter placed   History of Present Illness: This 75-year-old man lives in [**Location 66469**], NY and was hospitalized there two months ago with pneumonia.
Upon discharge, he was advised to follow-up with his PCP for repeat chest imaging to confirm resolution of the pneumonia.
He then saw his PCP roughly one month ago; plain radiography showed a clear chest but also disclosed an abdominal abnormality for which CT was advised.
Following the CT scan, the patient travelled to [**Hospital3 **] for vacation as previously planned; he asked to be contact[**Name (NI) **] with the results of the imaging study but no one called him.
Two weeks ago, he began having significant left-sided abdominal pain in his lower quadrant and hypogastrum.
This pain was associated with increasing difficulty passing urine.
He has dysuria early in the urinary stream but none otherwise.
Over the past couple of weeks, he has also had difficulty passing stool; he typically has one bowel movement daily, but he last had a BM four days ago.
The pain became increasingly intolerable over the past several days, so he sought attention at an OSH where a CT scan reportedly showed a large (9 x 12 x 18 cm) soft tissue mass in the area of the lower pole of the left kidney.
A thickened urinary bladder was also seen; there was no adenopathy.
The report of the non-contrast CT scan done in NY on [**7-21**] was subsequently obtained; it shows multiple lobulated masses forming a conglomerate size of at least 12 x 6.5 cm with obstruction near the level of the UPJ and dilatation of the intrarenal collection system and renal pelvis.
Perinephric stranding but no stones were seen.
On further review of systems, he reports midline low back pain that has significantly worsened over the past couple of months.
He also feels as if his legs have become weak over the past couple of weeks; he has trouble standing from a seated position.
He denies numbness, tingling, or pain in his legs.
He has had anorexia for the past several weeks, dramatically so over the past couple of days.
He denies fevers, chills, night sweats, or weight loss.
Past Medical History: 1. anxiety and panic attacks 2. pneumonia [**5-21**] 3. low back pain 4. colon perforation s/p primary repair [**2145**]  Social History: He lives in [**Location 66469**], NY with his second wife.

FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2161-8-24**]):    NO GROWTH.
MR HEAD  HISTORY: 75-year-old man with Burkitt's lymphoma with delirium and mental status changes.
There are no intracranial hemorrhages, masses, or areas of abnormal enhancement.
The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter differentiation is maintained with no areas of slow diffusion.
There are a minimal amount of periventricular white matter T2 hyperintensities which likely represent small vessel ischemic changes.
No suspicious bony abnormalities are seen.
IMPRESSION: Minimal small vessel ischemic changes.
T2 hyperintensity of the mastoid air cells bilaterally but worse on the left.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45 %).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
[**2161-8-19**] CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The visualized portion of the lung bases demonstrate dependent atelectatic changes/infilterates at both lung bases which appear relatively stable compared to the prior studies.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are also stable.
No pulmonary nodule is identified in the visualized portion of the lung bases.
The previously mentioned subcapsular hematoma of the left kidney is unchanged.
The left kidney has heterogenous enhancement and excretes the contrast material with no delay .
The left ureter is encased in the left retroperitoneal mass; however no hydronephrosis is noted on the left side.
The left retroperitoneal mass has significantly decreased in size, now measuring 47 x 15 mm compared to the prior study when it measured 106 x 34 mm.
The adrenal glands, right kidney, spleen, pancreas, liver and gallbladder, stomach, duodenum, loops of small bowel and large bowel are unremarkable.
No evidence of bowel obstruction is noted.
No fluid collection is noted within the abdomen and pelvis.
No free air or fluid is identified.
No pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric node is noted.
No pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal nodes are noted.
BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
No obstruction, perforation, or active bleeding is noted within the abdomen and pelvis.
Unchanged appearance of well contained subcapsular hematoma of the left kidney.
Encasement of the left ureter within the left retroperitoneal mass with no left hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
LUNG SCAN  [**2161-8-12**]  LUNG SCAN  Reason: 75 YEAR OLD MAN WITH RETROPERTONEAL LYMPHOMA, NEW AFIB AND DIALIATED RV CONCERNING FOR PUKM PROCESS  RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA: 5.1 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m MAA ([**2161-8-12**]); 42.5 mCi Tc-99m DTPA Aerosol ([**2161-8-12**]); HISTORY: 75 YEAR OLD MAN WITH RETROPERTONEAL LYMPHOMA, NEW AFIB AND DIALIATED RV CONCERNING FOR PUKM PROCESS  INTERPRETATION: Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol are markedly limited secondary to the inability of the patient to breathe in the radiopharmaceutical.
Perfusion images in the same 6 views demonstrate large defects within the superior segment of the right lower lobe and anterior segment of the right upper lobe.
Although the ventilation study is limited, it does show ventilation to these segments which is more uniform than the perfusion study.
Chest x-ray shows large left lower lobe atelectasis  IMPRESSION: Limited evaluation, but multiple perfusion defects place the study within a moderate or moderately high probability.
[**2161-8-3**] FINDINGS: The area of abnormality on the chest radiograph is predominantly linear in configuration on CT and is accompanied by volume loss with fissural displacement and crowding of bronchovascular structures.
No definite mass is identified and there is no central obstructing lesion identified.
Small calcified granuloma is incidentally noted in the left upper lobe and scattered foci of linear scar versus atelectasis are present throughout both lungs.
More confluent opacity adjacent to descending aorta in left lower lobe is likely atelectasis but warrants attention on follow up CT.
Within the mediastinum, a small amount of residual thymic tissue is present predominantly fatty involuted.
Numerous small lymph nodes are also present, none of which meet individual size criteria for enlargement.
Coronary artery calcifications are present.
Intravenous contrast is present within mildly distended renal collecting systems bilaterally, more dense on the left than the right.
There is also an area of low attenuation in the mass-like lobulated opacity in the left parapelvic region.
Additionally, there is pronounced corticomedullary differentiation in the left kidney compared to the right.
Dependent high- attenuation material is present in the gallbladder which appears mildly distended.
Within the skeletal structures, no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified.
Right lower lobe abnormality on chest x-ray corresponds to an area of apparent atelectasis or scarring on CT in right lower lobe.
Mass-like infiltration surrounding left renal pelvis, concerning for lymphoma given history of retroperitoneal mass.
Ascites and incompletely imaged small right hepatic lesion.
Clustered centrilobular nodules posterior segment right upper lobe, likely due to aspiration or acute infection.
At that time, multifocal areas of presumed atelectasis within the lungs can be reassessed for stability or resolution.
DIAGNOSIS: Retroperitoneal mass, biopsy:         Precursor B acute lymphoblastic lymphoma, see note.
Note: Sections show a diffuse atypical lymphoid infiltrate composed of large lymphocytes with smooth chromatin and frequent large prominent ([**12-17**]) nucleoli.
Scattered mitotic figures are present.
Overall, the morphologic and immunophenotypic findings are consistent with the diagnosis of precursor B-acute lymphoblastic lymphoma.
The presentation of a tumor mass with infiltrative cells in this patient's urine (see cytology), is very unusual.
There is a small subpopulation of CD19-positive B-cells that express CD10 and TdT.
INTERPRETATION  Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by an abnormal CD10 positive B cell lymphoproliferative disorder.
The cytomorphology, while suggestive of a Burkitt lymphoma, the immunophenotype is more consistent with a precursor (pre-precursor) B-acute lymphoblastic lymphoma.
See other concurrent flow cytometry (urine) studies and morphological findings on this patient.
Non-specific lymphoid profile; no phenotypic evidence of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma in specimen.
Abnormal events comprise ~25% of total gated events.They express CD19, CD10, HLA-DR, TdT and CD34.
INTERPRETATION  Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by (pre-) precursor B acute lymphoblastic lymphoma.
Cytomorphology is somewhat reminiscent of L3 blasts, that may be seen in Burkitt lymphoma and also in pre-B ALL.
There is disruption of blood flow by this structure, but the waveforms are normal and there is normal augmentation.
The major veins of the right leg are patent without evidence for intraluminal thrombus.
IMPRESSION: Filling defect within the left common femoral vein does not likely represent acute thrombus as this structure is fully compressible.
Alternatively, this most likely represents intimal or valvular injury or fibrin products secodnary to recent catherization.
Brief Hospital Course: 75-year-old man with Burkitt's lymphoma s/p CHOP and day 7 R-CVP chemotherapy.
# Burkitts Lymphoma: On presentation the patient was noted to have a large mass encasing the left ureter that extends into the left-sided peri-nephric fat and displaces the sigmoid colon anteriorly.
It was associated with ascites, hydronephrosis, and hydroureter, and the urinary bladder was distended and irregular in appearance.
Biopsy was performed and pathology was consistent with pre-B-acute lymphoblastic lymphoma.
He was transferred to the MICU for initiation of chemotherapy given high concern for tumor lysis syndrome in the setting of acute renal failure.
On [**2161-8-15**] he became neutropenic and was started on neupogen.
# Renal Failure: On presentation the patient was noted to have bilateral hydronephrosis and rising creatinine.
He was transferred to the MICU and CVVH was initiated in order to allow for the administration of chemotherapy in the setting of tenuous renal function.
On the evening of [**8-9**], however, the patient became quite agitated and pulled out his nephrostomy tube and had a transient period of anuria.
Urology was able to place a new foley with extraction of a large clot with improvement in his urine output.
His course was complicated by development of a subcapsular hematoma near the site of his interventions with associated 6 point hematocrit drop requiring transfusion of 3 units of PRBCs.
His hematocrit was subsequently watched closely in the setting of anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation and possible pulmonary embolism.
No further interventions were made.
#.Constipation-The patient developed constipation secondary to vincristine in his chemo regimen.
The constipation resolved in three days with increased colace and dulcolax.
# Sepsis/MRSA Bacteremia: On [**8-9**] the patient was noted to be increasingly agitated and febrile to 102 degrees.
Given his fevers and agitation he was started empirically on zosyn and vancomycin.
He had a TTE which showed no vegitations.
He was not started on gentamycin given his recent renal failure.
His fevers and mental status changes rapidly improved following the initiation of antibiotics.
Given his high grade bacteremia the decision was made to continue vancomycin for a [**3-20**] week course.
# Atrial Fibrillation:  On [**8-11**] the patient was noted to be in new onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
He was also noted to be tachypnic with slightly worsening oxygen saturations.
His EKG showed no ischemic changes.
He had no electrolyte abnormalities.
He underwent TTE which showed a moderately dilated right ventrical concerning for pulmonary embolism.
He underwent bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds which revealed a filling defect within the left common femoral vein which was thought to not represent an acute thrombus because it was fully compressible.
He underwent V/Q scan which was read as a limited study but moderate to moderately high probablity for pulmonary embolism.
He was originally started on metoprolol for rate control of his atrial fibrillation but this was unsuccessful.
They also reccommended further titration of his metoprolol and diltiazem to obtain rate control of 60-80 beats per minute at rest, and 100-120 with exercise.
# Delerium: On [**8-9**] the patient was noted to be increasingly delerious.
His mental status rapidly improved over the next 48 hours following treatment of his hypernatremia with D5W, initation of appropriate antibiotics for his high grade bacteremia and completion of the dexamethasone portion of his chemotherapy.
# Pulmonary Embolism: Workup as above.
V/Q scan with moderate to moderately high probability.
IVC filter placed without complication and he was started on heparin for anticoagulation with close monitoring of his hematocrit.
PE CT was deferred given his recent renal failure and it was felt that previously obtained imaging modalities were conclusive for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
# Pyuria: On admission the patient was noted to have pyuria.
At that time it was unclear whether this reflected a UTI or inflammatory cells spilling into the urine from the soft tissue mass encasing the left ureter.
On admission the patient was taking ciprofloxacin despite no positive urine cultures.
The patient did not exhibit pyuria on transfer to the floor.
Of note, the patient did develop hematuria on the floor for two days.
The hematuria resolved with discontinuation of the Heparin drip.
The heparin drip was restarted and the patient has not had further episodes of hematuria in 7 days.
He also received zyprexa PRN for insomnia with good effect.
#Oral Thrush: The patient developed oral thrush 4 days ago.
He received pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis in the setting of high dose dexamethasone.
