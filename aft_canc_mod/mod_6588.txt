Chemotherapy - 1 cycle   History of Present Illness: This is 73-year-old white woman with a past medical history for at least 30 pack years of smoking who originally presented to [**Hospital3 **] Emergency department, on [**2157-6-9**], for worsening dyspnea that occurred over the course of one month.
The patient is a poor historian, but her son reports that she started to cough up blood 24 hours prior to being admitted to the OSH.
At the OSH, a chest CT showed a distal tracheal mass with lumen narrowed to 4 mm, bilateral lung nodules and hilar lymphadenopathy.
Prior to the 24 hours preceding her admission the patient had not experienced any cough, hemoptysis, dysphagia, or heavy wheezing.
She also had not experienced any gradual symptoms suggestive of SVC syndrome (i.e.
facial swelling, venous distension in the neck, distended veins in the upper chest and arm, upper limb swelling, lightheadedness, or cough.).
She also endorses RLE weakness and difficulty ambulating over the past month without any pain in her back or incontinence like sx.
Both silicone Y-stent as well as the left mainstem metallic stent appeared patent as well as patency of distal airways in both right and the left bronchial trees.
The patient is currently feeling less short of breath than on admission, but not at her baseline.

Extensive soft tissue mass in the mediastinum and right hilum containing calcification with marked attenuation and encasement of the central airways, obstruction of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery, and distal SVC.
Differential diagnosis for these findings include fibrosing mediastinitis and lung cancer.
Evidence of prior granulomatous disease.
Patchy areas of ground-glass opacity within the right upper, right lower, and left lower lobes which are non-specific, but may be due to an infectious or inflammatory etiology.
Left thyroid nodule.
Right upper lobe segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries are not opacified due to obstruction of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery, and pulmonary embolism within this region is not excluded.
Extensive aortic calcification and atheroma without evidence of aortic dissection or aneurysm.
Non-opacification of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery, could be secondary to the compression from the mediastinal mass, but cannot exclude pulmonary embolism or thrombosis in the right upper lobe.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism in other parts of the lungs.
Multiple foci of signal abnormality with enhancement most concerning for metastatic disease, especially given the patient's history of lung cancer.
There is no evidence of cord compression of the visualized cord, nor is there evidence of a cauda equina syndrome.
Multilevel degenerative changes as detailed above with neural foraminal and lateral recess narrowing at several levels.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 2.4 cm in diameter, but incompletely characterized.
Small Cell Lung Cancer: Mrs. [**Known lastname 83307**] was admitted to the SICU on [**2157-6-10**] for a central airway mass in respiratory distress.
No events overnight.
A chest CT done on [**2157-6-10**] showed complete airway obstruction on the right upper lobe bronchus and proximal left main bronchus.
The bronchus intermedius  and right middle lobe bronchus are also mildly narrowed by this mass.
On [**2157-6-11**] she was taken to the operating room for Rigid bronchoscopy.
Transbronchial needle aspiration.
Extensive stage disease given disease cannot be confined to one radiation port, she has diffuse bony mets on MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] (no cord compression) although her brain MR did not show any mets despite study limited by motion artifact.
Radiation oncology saw the patient and determined that there was no necessity to treat urgently, and will follow as outpt.
Oliguria/CRF: Probably due to carboplatin/etoposide which are known to be nephrotoxic.
4. b/l LE weakness/pain: concerning as secondary to paraneoplastic syndrome, brain metastasis or spinal cord involvement.
L-spine MR w/ bony mets, but without cord compression.
Patient has PMH of peripheral neuropathy, probable [**1-10**] DM although distribution unorthodox given no foot neuropathy.
Dyspnea: Pt became acutely dyspneic early morning of [**6-20**], given recent oliguria dyspnea likely due to excess fluid; improved with 20 lasix IV.
Had ECHO which demonstrated hyperdynamic EF and mild diastolic failure (LVH).
Patient had CT scan to eval whether other etiology which demonstrated: no PE, b/l small pleural effusions, no PNA.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Distal Trachael Mass   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for shortness of breath.
You were diagnosed with small cell lung cancer.
Return to the ER if you experience worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, slurred speech or any other concerning symptoms.
