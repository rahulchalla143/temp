Of note, he was at [**Location (un) **] from [**Date range (1) 111096**] for a similar presentation and was given IV zosyn and neupogen, cultures were negative and was discharged on ciprofloxacin after becoming afebrile for 24 hours.
He had a CXR that was negative for cardiopulmonary issues.
He reported mild abdominal pain but otherwise no current complaints such as nausea, diarrhea, or constipation.

Heart is mildly enlarged.
Thoracic aorta is generally large and tortuous but not focally aneurysmal in the either the arch or descending portion.
There is no pleural abnormality or evidence of central adenopathy.
Ill-defined fluid in the hepatic hilum without a discrete mass along the biliary ducts, pancreas, or hepatic hilum, although it is difficult to exclude subtle mass or tumor infiltration.
If there is a concern for malignancy, it is possible that MR might be more sensitive to detect a subtle soft tissue mass along the extrahepatic biliary ducts or within the pancreas.
Irregular gallbladder wall thickening which may be a chronic process, although a recent or acute or chronic inflammatory process is not excluded by this examination.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 111097**] is a 76 year old man with a history of MDS with pancytopenia, s/p recent biliary stent placement on [**2108-2-24**] for a distal biliary stricture who presented to OSH hospital with fever, hypotension, and elevated LFTs; transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for ERCP for colangitis.
# Cholangitis (s/p ERCP with stent replacement):  Patient admitted to the MICU with fevers, hypotension, jaundice, RUQ pain, elevated LFTs.
He then underwent CT scan of the pancreas, that did not reveal any defined mass to explain the stricture.
CT scan did show a hyperemic gallbladder with pericholecystic stranding, consistent with cholangitis.
Inflammation and fever curve improved with stent placement and antibiotics.
# Febrile Neutropenia: The patient presented to [**Location (un) **] with fever, jaundice, abdominal pain, and hypotension.
In combination, and given his biliary history, these are likely due to cholangitis as above.
The differential of febrile neutropenia is very broad, but the patient had no other localizing signs throughout admission.
CXR and urinalysis without evidence of infection.
Fever curve trended down with continued zosyn.
# Myelodysplastic syndrome:  On chemotherapy with Pancytopenia, now transfusion dependent.
# Paroxysmal Afib: According to the documentation available the patient had new paroxysmal afib during his recent [**Location (un) **] hospitalization and was started on metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **].
The patient experienced no episodes of Afib with RVR during admission.
He did have [**11-21**] runs of short, non-sustained, asymptomatic SVT recorded on telemetry.
# DVT Prophylaxis: none, given severe thrombocytopenia .
# Access: PIV .
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - blood and urine cultures pending at time of discharge - Patient will need repeat ERCP in [**1-22**] weeks (scheduled) - Patient to complete two week course of zosyn for cholangitis (start date [**2108-3-13**]).
You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital **] Hospital for further evaluation of fevers, abdominal pain, low blood pressure.
You were found to have an obstruction in the common bile duct.
You were continued on antibiotics to treat an infection of the bile ducts.
