She was diagnosed [**7-17**] with adrenal mass found to be pheochromocytoma.
[**9-18**] MIBG with new uptake R parietal calvarium and L proximal thigh suspicious for mets, but no correlating lesions on anatomic imaging (pelvic CT/MRI confounded by artifact from prosthesis, head CT negative.
[**1-18**] had L hip film at OSH with lytic lesion, bone scan with increased uptake in that region.
FNA of L hip lesion was performed but was negative for malignancy.
Plan was to perform an elective revision of arthroplasty in [**Month (only) **], but on [**5-29**] fell and found to have pathologic periprosthetic fracture L hip at NEBH.

The patient was also immediately followed by the endocrine service and their recommendations were followed in regards to regulating her blood pressure through a high salt diet and volume expansion.
A full metastatic workup was done and a bone scan revealed a intense activity corresponding to the left pubic bone lesion seen on the previous CT scan.
Additionally, activity was noted in the left proximal femur focally, with some increased cortical activity extending distally from this region.
After obtaining clearance from the medical service the patient was brought to the operating room on hospital day number five for left proximal femur replacement by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**] with excision of pathologic bone.
These samples were sent for pathologic analysis.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, however required monitoring in the unit due to her somewhat labile blood pressure and tachycardia and the potential for a hypertensive crisis from her pheochromocytoma as well as a 2L blood loss that required transfusion.
She was immediately evaluated by the orthopaedic service and bolused 500 mL of normal saline, her electrolytes were repleted, and an EKG was performed revealing sinus tachycardia at a rate of 108 with no ischemic changes.
She was allowed to bear 75 percent of her weight on the right leg and was noted to have full motor function and normal sensation of the entire right lower extremity throughout her postoperative stay.
There were never any signs of wound infection and no drainage or redness about the wound was noted on the day of discharge.
The patient also began to work with physical therapy on postoperative day four and was noted to be making progress with mobility but would likely require a stay in a rehabilitation facility.
