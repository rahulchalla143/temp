There, he was found to have an elevated WBC from baseline, decreased platelet counts and positive UA.
He was found to have questionable ischemic vs. emboli to the finger.
Vascular surgery was consulted who believed this to be consistent with bruising, no concern for ischemia.
He was given ceftaz and linezolid empirically as well as stress dose steroids.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient stated that his only concern was left shoulder pain for a few days-inside the joint, some radiation, no paresthesias or weakness.
Pt's aid reported increased diarrhea and output from the stoma that "smells like C.diff" with some blood.
Pt's aid reported that he was on amoxicillin last week for dental procedure.
Antibiotic coverage was changed to cipro and flagyl to cover for suspected GU source of infection and C diff.
He was not transfused blood or platelets, because he has been trending down over the past month.
Currently, the patient complains of not being able to eat the things he likes because of diet restrictions, but has no other complaints.

Brief Hospital Course: This is a pleasant 83 y.o male with a history of HTN, advanced MDS, a fib, CVA, colon cancer s/p ostomy admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension in the setting of infection, likely GU and GI sources.
Hypotension/SIRS - secondary to C diff colitis:  On presentation the patient had significant leukocytosis (upwards of 40 at [**Location (un) 620**]), hypotension, hypothermia, and elevated lactate.
The most likely source of his infection was GI, given increased stool output from ostomy per 24 hour caregivers with recent antibiotic use for dental procedure.
The patient's hypotension and elevated lactate resolved and leukocytosis improved after 2L IV NS in ED and broad spectrum antibiotics.
The patient did not have evidence of any other source of infection during his hospital stay.
Advanced MDS:  Anemia and Thrombocytopenia - Seemed to be progressing over the past month per his primary care physician and primary oncologist.
Likely the patient's bruising/blood blisters on his fingers were related to his decreased platelet count.
Platelets were transfused given increased bleeding from ostomy, likely related to colitis.
Likely end stage disease, but family would like to change oncology care to [**Hospital1 18**].
Non-gap metabolic acidosis:  Secondary to increased amounts of output from ostomy.
Acute renal failure:  Secondary to dehydration given prerenal picture.
T wave inversions:  Present in V2-v5 on admission, likely related to demand ischemia in the setting of infection and anemia.
Trop 0.05 then 0.03, 0.03 in the setting of acute renal failure.
The patient and family were aware of the risk of bleeding outweighing risk of stroke.
Restarted toprol during stay and asked to restart lasix on discharge given scrotal, penile and leg edema following multiple transfusions.
