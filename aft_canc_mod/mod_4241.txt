Mild central intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with nondilated common hepatic duct to choledochojejunostomy.
Small amount of post-surgical free fluid.

No leak identified.
Scattered foci of free air likely post-operative.
Small left pleural effusion.
Bibasilar dependent atelectasis, left great than right.
High velocities at the graft-hepatic arterial anastomosis may reflect anastomotic site turbulence.
No detectable flow in left portal vein.
This may be due to slow or undetectable flow, or possibly left portal vein thrombosis.

On [**2170-8-28**], the patient underwent Whipple resection, modified classic, and saphenous vein interposition graft from splenic artery to common hepatic artery, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
After a brief, uneventful stay in the ICU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO/NGT, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter, and epidural catheter for pain control.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
The patient spikes fever on POD # 6 and WBC spikes to 32.7.
On POD # 8, repeat CT scan demonstrated increase in size of large area of hypo attenuation within segment [**Doctor First Name 690**] and IVb which has a thicker rim than previously.
Fluid was send for evaluation and grew enterococcus sensitive to Vancomycin.
On POD#15 repeat CT showed likely communication of liver collection through abd wall.
VASCULAR: On POD # 1, Doppler demonstrated arterial flow  within the common hepatic artery and the right hepatic artery.
On POD # 6, repeat Doppler revealed patent hepatic arteries and saphenous vein interposition graft and high velocities at the graft-hepatic arterial anastomosis.
GU: The patient has a history of urinary retention.
On POD # 5, Foley was placed back s/t 700 cc of residual urine on bladder scan.
has been voiding well since that time with no incontinence.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
On POD#13 drainage was noted from incision site and 6 surgical staples were removed and incision site was allowed to drain.
POD#14 5 staples removed from left side of wound and allowed to drain - both samples grew Vanc senstivie enterococcus.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
Pancreatic mass with involvement of replaced common hepatic artery.
Urinary retention 4.
Urinary tract infection   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Incision Care: *Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision site.
*You may shower, and wash surgical incisions with a mild soap and warm water.
JP Drain Care: *Please look at the site every day for signs of infection (increased redness or pain, swelling, odor, yellow or bloody discharge, warm to touch, fever).
*Make sure to keep the drain attached securely to your body to prevent pulling or dislocation.
