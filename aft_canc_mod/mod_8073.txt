This morning at 1AM, Pt's daughter, [**Name (NI) 7279**], called oncologist to state pt has been nauseated and having multiple episodes of bilious non-bloody vomiting throughout night.
No worsening abdominal pain, no fevers or chills.
She has had a recent bout with thrush and endorses some paroxyms of throat pain and occasional odynophagia but this is distinct from her newer sensation of nausea/vomiting.
She has noticed a new rash recently on her legs and back, ever since using a lidocaine patch last week.
She did contact her oncologist who prescribed cephalexin for a possible cellulitis but she has not taken any of this.
Of note, pt had recent admission [**Date range (1) 93970**] for abdominal pain felt due to her worsening disease burden, and underwent palliative abdominal pleurex catheter placement on [**12-7**].
She has had an ongoing problem with severe constipation, being treated as an outpatient with magnesium citrate (last BM 2 days ago on Saturday).
She has not had any further BMs or flatus since then.

WBC returned elevated at 32 (95% neutrophils), with hyponatremia to Na 118 and non-hemolyzed K of 6.4.
Abdominal CT scan showed large amount of ascites with catheter in place, pancreatic mass with liver mets, and new peritoneal infiltration, possible lymphatic involvement, with diffuse omental caking and infiltrated mesentery.
She denies abdominal pain at the moment.

+ conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
OP without evidence of thrush.
Neck Supple, No LAD, No thyromegaly.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
ABDOMEN: slightly distended with pleurex catheter in place in LUQ.
+ TTP in b/l lower quadrant, no perioneal signs.
EXTREMITIES: 2+ peripheral edema, dopplerable dorsalis pedis b/l SKIN: mottled appearance to flanks and lower back with few discrete erythematous macules on anterior thighs.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing there is no significant change.
New large volume ascites.
Catheter in place for peritoneal drainage.
Large pancreatic mass.
New areas of peritoneal thickening along the left hemi-diaphragm, infiltration of the mesentery, and diffuse omental cake suggesting peritoneal carcinomatosis.
Small bowel wall thickening, probably due to peritoneal tumor involvement.
Partial thrombosis of left portal vein, also seen on prior scan.
CXR ([**2181-12-10**]): IMPRESSION: No pneumonia.
Pathology of Peritoneal fluid [**2181-12-11**]: Positive for malignant cells, consistent with poorly differentiated carcinoma with necrosis.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Hospital Unit Name 13533**] [**Date range (1) 93972**]: 67F with stage 4 pancreatic cancer now p/w 4 days of nausea and vomiting, inabaility to tolerate po, and fatigue, found to have hyponatremia, hyerkalemia, and ARF.
Nausea and vomiting - most likely etiology was believed to be profound ileus from meds, carcinomatosis, vs incomplete SBO vs. extrinsic compresison of mass into UGI tract.
Despite recent thrush, it did not appear to be a primary esophageal cause.
Other DDx includes peritonitis, primary or secondary, esp given recent catheter placement and elevated WBC count.
Has been deemed an unacceptable risk for surgical palliation.
Reglan was added with symptomatic improvement.
The patient was initially started on Cipro/Flagyl/Ceftriaxone for bacterial peritonitis, but was switched to 2g daily Ceftriaxone for treatment of SBP and Cipro/Flagyl were discontinued.
Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer - has been on palliative chemo with recent decision to move towards hospice care as an outpatient.
There were no EKG changes.
Hyperkalemia resolved by the time of callout from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Hyponatremia - The patient with chronic hyponatremia (Was 129 on d/c on [**11-29**]).
Exaceration was believed to be due to a combination of hypovolemia given n/v, ketonuria, urine SG, and ARF as well as siADH.
There were no evidence of MS changes or seizure activity.
Urine lytes were initially consistent with the picture of hypovolemia.
Urine lytes were conistent with a picture of siADH.
All medications were stopped except PPI [**Hospital1 **] as it improved her nausea, enemas for constipation and dialudid.
She had therapeutic paracentesis when her belly was distended and uncomfortable.
