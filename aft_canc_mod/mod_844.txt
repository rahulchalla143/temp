Metastatic RCC with LUL collapse [**2-28**] compression: Tumor progression since last month and pt seems unable to tolerate debulking procedure.
Repeat CT chest performed on [**2164-1-6**] showed progression of disease burden and incidental finding of a subsegmental RML PE.
Heparin IV started, head CT with IV contrast did not show any evidence of brain metastesis, and the patient was transitioned to coumadin.
However, given evidence of small but enlarging pericardial effusion on TTE, anticoagulation was discontinued prior to discharge given concern for high risk of bleeding into a potentially malignant effusion.
Her outpatient oncologist followed her throughout the course of her admission; he reported that there was no systemic therapy left that would likely alter the course of her disease.
Cardiac: Inferior ST elevations seen on EKG following administration of epinephrine for bradycardia and hypotension.
Cardiology was consulted on [**2164-1-5**] and the patient was started on a nicardipine drip to treat coronary vasospasm.
Beta blocker was held to allow for reflex tachycardia in setting of PE.
