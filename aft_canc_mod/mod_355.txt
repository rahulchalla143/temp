Admission Date:  [**2158-11-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-12-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2089-11-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2024**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath, pneumothorax  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Chest Tube Placement and Removal Revision of T10-12 laminiecotomy incision   History of Present Illness: 69 year old woman with a history of breast and renal cell carcinoma  with metastasis into the lungs and bone and recent CVA in [**2158-7-14**].
Pt had been complaining of several days of shortness of breath at her rehab facility which had progressively been getting worse.
She had an outpatient CT scan today to evaluate for recollection of recently drained pleural effusion.
CT scan today reveal large right sided pneumothorax, thought to be causing her tachycardia and increased shortness of breath.
Patient fairly asymptomatic with just complaints of shortness of breath.
No chest pain.
She had a right sided chest tube placed with air and fluid return.
Pt was initially diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma in [**2142**] and breast cancer in [**2155**].
She had a CT scan on [**2158-10-4**] which showed cord compression.
She had cord stablization surgery on [**10-12**] which was complicated by continued serous drainage from her back and recurrent pleural effusion.
Her pleural fluid grew MRSA and she was started on IV vancomycin.
It is thought that her previous surgical site is communicating with her pleural fluid and may have been the cause of her pneumothorax.
On the floor, patient states that she is still short of breath but may be her her baseline.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI, back pain at site of previous surgery, + anxiety, did have urinary retention following back surgery - she has had foley removed for 2 days and has been voiding spontaneously though cannot get to the bathroom independently so she is wearing diapers.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies arthralgias or myalgias, no weakness or numbess.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
Treated  with neoadjuvant dose-dense AC and weekly taxol ending [**2155-10-3**], bilateral mastectomy [**2155-12-25**] (after lumpectomy with positive margins), radiation ending [**3-22**].
[**2156-7-14**]: CT torso (done because of elevated alk phos) showed 1.5 and 0.6 cm left upper lobe nodules.
[**2156-8-26**]: Left upper lobectomy showed two foci of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
CT-guided biopsy consistent with renal cell carcinoma.
Bone scan [**2157-4-18**] also showed involvement of several left ribs.
Sutent ended in [**2158-1-14**] because of disease progression.
[**2158-2-7**]: MRI L-spine with T11 disease with persistent mass effect on thecal sac but no significant cord compression, and T9 and T10 disease, all likely unchanged.
New T12 compression fracture.
Significant progression of L3 vertebral body lesion with pathologic fracture and retropulsion of posterior cortex.
[**2158-2-13**]: CT torso with interval marked progression of innumerable pulmonary mets since [**2157-8-2**].
Destructive lytic lesion within left femoral head.
CT torso showed osseous mets in spine and left ibs, with interva lincrease in size in soft tissue component at T11 encasing thecal sac, invading cord, and invading more than 50% of the spinal canal.
At L3, compression fracture with soft tissue component extending into spinal canal.
Destructive lytic lesion within left femoral head.
[**2158-4-19**]: C1D1 08-184 (avastin/temsirolimus) [**2158-6-7**]: CT torso with significant decrease in size of bilateral pulmonary lesions and stable osseous disease with decrease in soft tissue mass at T11 - [**Date range (3) 10263**]: admitted for PNA, mental status changes, found to have frontal CVA, taken off study - [**2158-8-9**] CT TORSO: stable disease -[**2158-10-4**] to have a T11 lesion causing cord compression and underwent spine surgery [**2158-10-12**] with Drs.
Other Past Med Hx: - Hypertension - Breast Cancer s/p resection - gout - E Coli and Klebsiella UTI both sensitive to cipro and Bactrim [**10/2158**] - Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease secondary to underlying cancer.
Received 1 unit pRBC on [**2158-10-24**] with good response - History of anxiety and mild delerium when in the hospital - Wound drainage s/p Spinal Fusion   Social History: She lives with her 3 sons who assist with her medical care.
She is a non-smoker, no alcohol or other drugs.
Family History: Father had esophageal cancer.
Her maternal grandmother had breast cancer in her 70s.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: Vitals: T: 36.7 BP:100/53 P:104 R: 18 O2:  99% 2L General: Alert, oriented, appear fatigued but in no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, pupils equal and reactive to light, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Decreased breath sounds on right and decreased at bases bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: tachycardic with regular rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, normoactive bowel sounds, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly, does have diffuse bruising on abdomen with palpable hematomas from lovenox injections GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, bilateral non pitting pedal edema, large dressing in place on back with some serosanguinous drainage.
On discharge, there is a R thoracic dressing in place, otherwise not changed.
However, in addition, the prior fluid collection in the paraspinal soft tissues has been largely replaced by air, with extensive air not only in the paraspinal tissues but also also wrapping around the right aspect of the thecal sac and extending into the T11 corpectomy bed about the indwelling vertebral body cage device.
The extensive air within the paraspinal soft tissues and the drainage of the prior fluid collection suggests a connection either externally or with the adjacent right pleural space, though this cannot be definitively identified on this study.
Redemonstration of extensive metastatic disease, as above.
New heterogeneous, diffuse ground-glass opacities predominantly seen in the left lung.
These could represent pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.
Alternatively, given leftward mediastinal shift, a component could represent atelectasis 5.
Contrast extravasation, with 50 cc of contrast material extravasated into the patient's right hand.

# pneumothorax: Pt with evidence of pneumothorax on chest CT, thought to be secondary to possible communication between surgical site and pleural fluid.
The patient went for revision of the surgical site on [**2158-11-23**] where the ffascia was closed and debrided.
Chest tube placed to water seal the following day althouhg evidence on cxr of enlarging pneumothorax was noted.
She expressed a desire to be home soon, so with those goals in mind, we allowed for slight re-accumulation of PTX as long as she remained hemodynamically stable.
# MRSA pleural fluid: Pt was continued on vancomycin for MRSA noted in pleural fluid [**10-26**].
Given possible open communication to surgical site, patient was taken back to the OR by neurosurgery for wound irrigation and fascial closure.
Tissue cultures grew sparse growth of MRSA and rare growth of acinetobacter, but given that her goals of care were to go home on hospice and she did not appear to be clinically infected, we decided not to treat with long-term antibiotics.
# metastatic RCC: Originally diagnosed in [**2142**] with lung mets in [**2156**] and bony mets [**2157**] complicated by spinal cord compression requiring stablization.
She has had numerous radiation therapies and chemotherapies but has not received any treatment since her CVA in [**Month (only) 205**] of this year.
# pain control: patient's current pain regimen includes oxycontin 40mg TID with dilaudid 4-6mg q3hr for pain.
Per her oncologist, she gets confused with too much opiates so use dilaudid sparingly.
# hypertension: on valsartan at home, holding in setting of hypotension.

You were admitted with shortness of breath which was discovered to be due to air in the area around your lungs.
This in turn was found to be due to a  communication between the pleural space (the space between your lungs and chest wall) and your surgical wound from early [**Month (only) 462**].
You still have some air within your chest, but it is much decreased.
