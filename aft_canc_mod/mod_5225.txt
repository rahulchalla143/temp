Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] y/o full code male, resident of [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, with mechanical aortic valve secondary to Listeria endocarditis (on coumadin), Coombs positive autoimmune hemolytic anemia (warm autoantibody, on prednisone), CAD s/p NSTEMI [**7-11**], CKD stage III, chronic CHF (likely diastolic with EF 50%), and history of GIB, who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED with weakness and was noted to have a hematocrit of 19 and melena on guaiac exam.
# Acute on chronic anemia/hct drop.
Chronic anemia with baseline Hct 25-30 secondary to warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (on prednisone, managed by heme/onc), stage III CKD, and myelodysplasia.
Acute hematocrit drop to Hct 16 was initially suspected to be from UGIB vs. LGIB given melena on guaiac exam (especially considering his history of esophageal erosions/gastritis/lymphangiectasias).
Differential also included acute on chronic hemolysis from his warm hemolytic anemia.
He received an upper GI endoscopy that did not reveal an active source of bleeding, a non-bleeding duodenal polyp and a small hiatal hernia were found.
# CAD/left arm pain.
Likely result of demand ischemia given acute drop in Hct, there were no ST/T changes on EKG and although his troponin level was mildly elevated on discharge, it trended down and his pain resolved with oxygen improvement of his anemia.
He was found to have INR 5.9 on admission, coumadin was held and he received 5mg PO vitamin K in the ED with reversal of his INR to 2.2 in the setting of a potential GI bleed.
Due to this rapid reversal, there was suspicion that the initial INR was a laboratory error.
# Autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
# Stage III CKD: Slight acute on chronic renal failure, likely secondary to hypovolemia in setting of anemia.
A CBC should be checked in 1 week to ensure his anemia and thrombocytopenia is stable.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Anemia: from either lower intestinal gastrointestinal source or due to acute exacerbation of chronic warm hemolytic anemia Mechanical valve: due to history of listeria endocarditis, on coumadin GERD Chronic kidney disease: Stage III Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Coronary Artery Disease Subclinical hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 66590**], You came to the hospital because you were anemic (your blood counts were much lower than normal) and we suspected possible bleeding from your gastrointestinal tract.
You also have an autoimmune disease which causes you to be anemic, this disease was also likely contributing to your lower blood counts.
Due to your anemia, we stopped your coumadin and you are temporarily on heparin.
Please make the following changes to your medications: - Start Bactrim SS 1 tab daily (this is to prevent a lung infection while you are on prednisone) - Start Clotrimazole cream 1% apply moderate amount to rash on right foot two times daily for 7 days - Start Heparin IV infusion 1000 Units/hr until INR is at goal 2.5-3.5 - Start miralax 17grams (1 capful) daily as needed for constipation  If you develop any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding including black or bloody stools, nausea and vomitting black or bloody fluids, please seek emergency care immediately.
