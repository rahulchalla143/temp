Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Presyncope Acute on Chronic Renal Failure Pulmonary Embolisms Bilateral Deep Vein Thromboses Benign Prostatic Hyperpertrophy Urinary Hesitancy .
Secondary: Squamous Cell Cancer of the Vocal Cord Atrial fibrillation Partial Complex Seizure Disorder Coronary Artery Disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2093**] Hypertenison Hypercholesterolemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 5903**],   You were admitted to the hospital due to increased weakness, difficutly urinating, and confusion.
It seems your symptoms were most likely due to your acute renal dysfunction, and your symptoms gradually resolved when your kindey function improved.
Additionally, the results of your vocal cord biopsy returned, and you have been diagnosed with squamous cell cancer of the vocal cord.
Lastly, you were found to have blood clots in the vessels of your lungs as well as your the veins of your lower extremities.
You understood being placed on anticoagulant therapy carried a risk of increased bleeding, including bleeding in the brain as you have had in the past.
You have been started on a new medications to help with your enlarged prostate: Tamulosin 0.4 mg at night- for urinary hesitancy Finasteride 5 mg daily- for urinary hesitancy Enoxaparin 80 mg subcutaneous injections 2x a day- for leg/lung clots .
