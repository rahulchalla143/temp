Admission Date:  [**2150-2-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2150-3-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2088-5-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: Sepsies  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Excision of right basilic vein Bone marrow aspiration Lumbar puncture Central venous cannulization Hemodialysis  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 8271**] is a 61 yo female with biphenotypic leukemia recently admitted [**Date range (1) 99079**] for initiation of chemotherapy s/p Part A and B hyperCVAD c/b slow recovery of counts and neutropenic fever on clofarabine and ara-C as an outpatient completed on [**2150-1-27**] readmitted with diarrhea, vomiting and concern for infected PICC found to have high grade VRE bacteremia (positive blood cx [**Date range (1) 15945**]) and coag neg staph bacteremia ([**2-2**]) as well as septic thrombophlebitis initially on linezolid but now on Daptomycin.
Course c/b renal failure (Cr 0.9 [**2-9**]-> 1.2 [**2-10**]->2.7 [**2-11**]) presumed secondary to ATN given muddly brown casts on U/A but also received 3 doses gentamycin [**Date range (1) 99080**].
Has also had altered mental status last several days of unclear etiology with negative head CT. .
Today, she had borderline low BPs 90s-100s and prolonged epistaxis x 40 minutes which resolved with afrin.
She went to OR for vein removal and was sent to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] post-op for hypotension on peripheral neo and remaiend intubated [**2-3**] tachypnea and concern for respiratory failure prior to OR.
Past Medical History: Diagnosed with biphenotypic leukemia in [**11-10**] by bone marrow biospy due to low counts, s/p part A of hyper CVAD treatment complicated by mucositis, slow to recover WBC counts, repeat bone marrow biopsy showing continued disease, so she was started on part B of hyper CVAD treatment.
Part B was complicated by neutropenic fever.
She was given two cycles of IT methotrexate,  her CNS did not have any evidence of disease.
Family History: Mother died at 85 of large cell lymphoma Father died at of colon cancer DM and HTN both run in the family No FH of leukemia.
Physical Exam: T: 99.1F, Tm: 102.6  BP: 136/74  HR: 100  RR: 18 SaO2: 98% RA General: pleasant, nad HEENT: op clear, mmm, no lesions Neck: supple, no LAD Cardiovascular: RRR, no MRG Respiratory: CTA bilat w/o wheezes/rhonchi/rales Back: no spinous process tenderness, no CVA tenderness Gastrointestinal: +bs, soft, non-tender, non-distended MS: no edema Skin: Contact dermatitis at PICC site on right forearm.
Neurological: aaox3, cn 2-12  Pertinent Results: [**2-5**]: UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT IMPRESSION: Venous thrombosis involving the medial brachial vein, basilic vein, and peripheral portion of the axillary vein.
[**2-6**]: ECHO Technically suboptimal study.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
No significant interval change in venous thromboses involving the right axillary, basilic, as well as the medial brachial veins.
Symmetric loss of phasicity of the subclavian veins bilaterally.
This appearance can be secondary to more proximal thrombosis and seems to have progressed.
MARKEDLY HYPOCELLULAR MARROW (LESS THAN 5% CELLULAR) WITH SCANT LEFT-SHIFTED MYELOPOIESIS AND FOCAL MEGAKARYOCYTIC CLUSTERING.
NO DIAGNOSTIC MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES OF LEUKEMIA SEEN, SEE NOTE.
The marrow largely consists of stroma and eosinophilic debris consistent with ablative chemotherapy.
Myeloid elements are markedly decreased and exhibit focal clusters of immature myeloid precursors.
[**2-11**]: RUS IMPRESSION: Slightly limited exam.
No evidence of hydroureteronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.
[**2-14**]: EEG IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the low voltage slow background and occasional bursts of generalized slowing.
These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathy.
Medications, metabollic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing, but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings at times.
The beta rhythm is most often attributed to benzodiazepine or other gaba-ergic medications.
There were no epileptiform features.
[**2-14**]: MRI IMPRESSION: No gadolinium-enhanced images are obtained to assess for meningitis or meningeal inflammation.
However, no brain edema is seen to suggest obviously metastatic lesions or abscess.
Decreased signal is seen within the bony structures which could be secondary to patient's leukemia.
No mass effect or hydrocephalus.
[**2-18**]: EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to a mildly slow and disorganized background with frequent periods of bihemispheric artifact caused by head rocking movements.
This background is most suggestive of a mild encephalopathy.
There were no areas of prominant focal slowing, and there were no focal, lateralized or epileptiform abnormalities noted.
Diffusely echogenic liver without focal lesions, compatible with diffuse fatty infiltrates.
Other forms of liver disease or advanced liver disease such as fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded.
No hydroureteronephrosis in either kidney.
[**2-23**]: Head CT IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormalities.
No evidence of ductal dilatation.

After the OR she was transferred to the ICU as she remained intubated, and was septic due to her high grade VRE and coag neg staph from PICC infection in setting of no immune system.
#) BIPHENOTYPIC LEUKEMIA: Bone marrow biopsy done during her stay showed no leukemia after her recent cycle of clofarabine and ara-c.
However, she remained persistently thrombocytopenic and a repeat bone marrow biopsy done on [**2-27**], showed a paucity of megakaryocytes which was thought to be due to the clofarabine.
On the last week of her admission, she experienced oozing around line sites as well as epistaxis.
epistaxis improved with afrin, pressure and ice packs.
#) ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: based on the large amounts of muddy brown casts thought to be due to ATN in setting of sepsis, causing her to go into anuric renal failure.
Renal recommends that she have her electrolytes and renal function checked daily for at least 1 week after her last HD schedule to document stable renal and electrolyte balance.
Work-up for this change was extensive: MRI negative, two EEGs negative for seizure but c/w encephalopathy, CSF negative for infection and malignant cells, no improvement with HD.
She had been taking moxifloxacin for prophylaxis of TB reactivation and though she had been taking this for a long time, she had new renal failure and reports of quinolone toxicity in the elderly describe a similar syndrome.
On discharge, she is alert and oriented x 3 with no focal neruologic deficits.
# URINARY RETENTION: After return of some kidney function and production of urine, Mrs. [**Known lastname 8271**] was often unable to void spontaneously, despite the sensation of needing to void.
# DECONDITIONING: Mrs. [**Known lastname 8271**] has deconditioning due to prolonged ICU course.
Due to altered mental status, this was discontined (see explanation above).
Given intermittant dialysis at this time, would recommend titration of metoprolol to previous dose and restarting amlodipine as necessary.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Biphenotypic Leukemia Vancomyocin Resistant Enterococcus Bacteremia Septic Thrombophlebitis Acute Kidney Injury requiring Dialysis Altered Mental Status - resolved   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital due to an infection in your PICC line.
After your operation,  you were sent to the intensive care unit because you need close monitoring due to your infection.
Your kidneys also stopped working and you required dialysis to help remove excess fluid from your body.
You started producing urine in increasing amounts and will likely only need intermittant dialysis for a short time period.
If there is a change in scheduling, you will be notified.
