[** **] Date:  [**2109-2-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2109-2-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2050-5-18**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: AMS  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Diagnostic Paracentesis   History of Present Illness: 58 year old F with Multiple Sclerosis with repeated admissions this month for AMS who was admitted to [**Location **] [**2-6**] for confusion after a fall and found to have UTI and bil DVT and is now transffered to us primarily for continuous EEG monitoring d/t continued AMS.
She was recently admitted to [**Hospital3 1196**] ON [**2109-1-24**] for UTI and became delirious at that point.
However, her delirium did improve and she was alert and oriented upon discharge.
She was at for less than a day, at which point she was transferred back to [**Hospital3 1196**] with altered mental status where she was discharged on [**1-26**] back to rehab.
She fell backwards and sustained a occipital scalp hematoma, there was no loss of consciousness, no incontinence, tongue [**Last Name (un) 20694**] or limb movements.
At [**Hospital3 **] was reported to have intermitent confusion with peridos in which she is able to converse and cooperate.
Noncontrast head CT showed atrophy but no acute findings.
MRI scan was limited d/t movement and showed [**Known lastname 1007**] matter findings consistent with multiple sclerosis, but could not absolutely r/o infarction.
EEG show generalized slowing and some high-amplitude sharp activity which was felt to be consistent with an encephalopathy, although seizure could not be ruled out.
She also reported increased swelling bilaterally in her lower extremities over past few months left > right, limiting her mobility.
She denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, headache, focal numbness or weakness.
LENI demonstarted DVT in the left common femoral and proper femoral veins +  clot was also seen in the right common femoral vein.
She denied any CP or SOB.
VQ scan was was interpreted as very low probability for pulmonary embolism.
Echo showed mild-mod TR and minimal PHTN (28mmHg) w/o RV strain.
Past Medical History: Osteoporosis - multiple sclerosis, wheelchair bound with indwelling Foley, - hyperlipidemia - frequent urinary tract infections - myelopathy - chronic pain syndrome.
A brother is healthcare proxy.
Family History: Mother had multiple sclerosis and father had hypertension and depression.
Physical Exam: [**Known lastname **] Exam: General: awake but not alert, non-verbal, not following commands, answers in repeated monosylabals, no acute distress, very thin and wasted.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: RRR, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: bil air entery, no wheezes, rales, ronchi Abdomen: soft, non-tender,  mildly distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly GU: foley in place Ext: +3 edema bil left > rt, left distal LE is cool with motelling and cyanosis in toes, DP are however 2+ bilaterally.
No increased WOB.
No wheezes, rales or rhonchi.
No rigidity, rebound or guarding.
EXT: 2+ pitting edema to the thighs.
Large pelvic masses that are mainly composed of soft tissue but have some cystic components within them.
Bilateral hydronephrosis is detected secondary to external compression of the ureters by the pelvis masses.
IVC filter is well positioned, filling defects that are compatible with DVT are seen in the right common iliac vein.
No immediate complication.
Cytology consistent with adenocarcinoma.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for [**Month/Day/Year **]: 58 year old F with Multiple Sclerosis with repeated admissions this month for AMS who was admitted to [**Location **] [**2-6**] for confusion after a fall and found to have UTI and bilateral DVTs transferred for continuous EEG monitoring d/t continued AMS found to have widespread ovarian cancer.
Active Problems: .
# AMS/Delirium: Likely toxic metabolic encephalopathy given marked improvement with antibiotics and EEG consistent with generalized encephalopathy and no e/o seizure or epileptiform activity.
There was initially concern for bacterial/viral meningitis/encephalitis and LP was performed at [**Hospital3 **].
CSF showed Tot Protein 47, Glucose 63, RBC 2140 (Tube 1), RBC 20 (Tube 4), likely representative of a traumatic tap.
MRI was also performed at [**Hospital3 2568**] and showed periventricular [**Known lastname **] matter changes consistent with MS. On the floor her mental status rapidly improved, though she contined to wax and wane with occasional hallucinations and inappropriate responses to questioning, intersperced with periods of lucidity consistent with delerium.
# DVT: Pt with b/l DVTs, for which she was started on Heparin gtt and Warfarin.
CT C/A/P was performed due to concern for malignancy or IVC clot and showed a large pelvic mass with widespread peritoneal metastases consistent with advanced ovarian cancer.
She should be continued on Lovenox shots as prescribed for at least the next 6 months with consideration given to lifelong anticoagulation given her known hypercoagulable state.
# Ovarian Cancer: Large pelvic mass with associated ascites, omental caking peritoneal seeding and pleural effusion were seen on CT scan.
Ascitic fluid was exudative, consistent with peritoneal carcinomatosis.
Cytology showed adenocarcinoma and Heme/Onc was consulted.
# UTI: She was found to have UTI at [**Hospital3 2568**] and placed on Cipro, which was stopped after 3d due to worsening mental status.
At [**Hospital1 18**] she was given Ceftriaxone; urine culture grew enterococcus sensitive to Ampicillin and Ceftriacxone was stopped and she was given a 7d course of Ampicillin.
Ampicillin was continued due to her recurrent UTIs and hospital admissions for AMS; she will require lifelong Ampicillin prophylaxis and should continue q6h straight cath for her neurogenic bladder.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Pt with elevated Cr.
Initial concern was for pre-renal failure given poor PO intake and she was given IVF without improvement.
CT C/A/P was then performed and showed a large pelvic mass compressing the bilateral ureters and mild bilateral hydronephrosis.
# Atonic Bladder: At baseline pt straight caths herself for atonic bladder due to MS. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] to [**Hospital1 18**] she had an indwelling foley.
# Tachycardia: Likely [**3-14**] hypermetabolic state given widespread ovarian cancer.
Chronic Problems: .
# MS: Current presentation unlikely due to MS flare.
Her brother, [**Name (NI) **] is involved in her care and will be present at her appointments to facilitate discussion of her options moving forward.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] Village - [**Location 4288**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Toxic Metabolic Encephalopathy Secondary Diagnosis: Ovairan Cancer Recurrent UTIs Multiple Sclerosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted for altered mental status, which we feel was due to your urinary tract infection.
