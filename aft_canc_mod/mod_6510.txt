There is no pneumothorax, pneumoperitoneum, pleural effusion or mediastinum.
Aside from a heavily calcified nodular lesion in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe, lungs are clear of any focal abnormality.
The lesion on two views is close to a large and tortuous vessel, raising the possibility that it is a thrombosed AVM as opposed to the more likely calcified lung nodules, granuloma, and hamartoma.
Hyperinflation best appreciated on the lateral view suggests emphysema, or alternatively small airways obstruction.
There is evidence of central adenopathy.
