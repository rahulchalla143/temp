Admission Date:  [**2179-4-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-4-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2100-7-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Erythromycin Base / IV Dye, Iodine Containing Contrast Media  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**] Chief Complaint: Weakness, falls, fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: History of Present Illness: 78 year old female with metastatic invasive lobular breast cancer on gemcitabine with peripheral neuropathy who presents with fever and multiple falls.
Patient was admitted to OMED from [**4-16**] - [**4-17**] for bilateral LE cellulitis.
She reports comliance with this medication and some reduction in swelling of her legs but claims that they are still "hard" (swollen) and red (L > R).
She was not aware she had a fever but reports she has felt "cold" but no rigors.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denies dysuria, stool or urine incontinence.
Denies rashes or skin breakdown.
In [**Month (only) 205**] [**2169**] she was diagnosed with an invasive lobular carcinoma of the  same breast.
Because of a rising CA [**93**]-29 a PET scan was done on [**2174-5-16**] which revealed: There is focal abnormal uptake of FDG throughout the spine, bilateral ribs, bilateral clavicles, left scapula, left humerus, sternum, bilateral iliac bones.
There is also uptake within subcentimeter  left hilar lymph nodes (SUV 4.8), and asymmetrically within the right lingual tonsil (SUV  4.8).
There are bilateral maxillary retention cysts/polyps, colon diverticulosis, a 5mm right lower lobe nodule (not FDG avid but may be due to small size), and a nodular component to a left lower lobe scar.
The Arimidex was discontinued in the hope of seeing a withdrawal response.
A PET scan done on [**2176-5-21**] showed dramatic improvement in osseous metastatic disease and resolution of FDG avidity and increased sclerosis of the previously FDG avid skeletal metastases.
There was no new skeletal lesion.
She was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**11-30**]-30, [**2176**] because of severe diarrhea.
Widespread new osseous metastatic disease throughout ribs, vertebral bodies, scapulae, and several new lesions in pelvis, all FDG-avid.
A majority of the FDG avid lesions seen in the prior study, are now non FDG avid.
However a few new FDG avid lesions are present.

Her previous colonoscopy on [**2174-8-31**] only showed Diverticulosis  of the sigmoid colon and descending colon.
Father died of complications of lead poisoning.
Gait not tested nor full strength in LE not tested secondary to pain and instability.
CN grossly intact SKIN/EXT: Warm and erythema of LLE with some mild underlying edema, also mild erythma and warmth of RLE as well which is improved from the faint line drawn of margin previously.
Substantial onychomycosis of nails on RLE.
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left common femoral, superficial femoral or popliteal veins.
Limited evaluation of the calf veins due to subcutaneous edema.
-CXR ([**2179-4-22**]): No acute cardiopulmonary process.
-Renal US ([**2179-4-24**]): No stones or hydronephrosis.
-KUB ([**2179-4-25**]): Supine and left decubitus views of the abdomen show considerable increase in distention and wall thickening of the large bowel consistent with pancolitis.
There is no free intraperitoneal gas.
Diffuse thickening and wall edema with stranding of the colon consistent with severe pancolitis, most likely infectious in etiology; however, inflammatory or ischemic causes cannot be excluded.
Borderline dilated transverse colon, which in the right clinical setting is a sign of toxic megacolon.
There is no evidence for perforation.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis, worse on the right.
Multiple sclerotic bony lesions consistent with patient's known bony metastatic disease.
No acute fractures.
Small hiatal hernia.
Brief Hospital Course: 78F with met breast CA on gemcitabine, initially admitted for fevers, abdominal pain and leukocytosis, subsequently found to have C. diff colitis, [**Last Name (un) **] and and concern for toxic megacolon  #C. diff colitis with toxic megacolon and sepsis: While on the medicine floor, she was found to have worsening abdominal pain and distention in the setting of C. diff, which was likely related to her recent antibiotics during prior admission for cellulitis.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension and hypoxia, the latter of which is discussed below.
KUB was suggestive of pancolitis.
She had a CT abd/pelvis which confirmed pancolitis and suggested borderline toxic megacolon.
On HD5, she became increasingly lethargic and confused.
The worsening of her clinical condition raised concern for worsening of her sepsis and progression of her toxic megacolon.
#[**Last Name (un) **]: Initially presumed to be pre-renal given her diarrhea and poor PO intake.
However, it is likely she progressed to ATN given her poor urine output despite fluid challenge.
Bladder pressure was also elevated to 16 in the setting of her C. diff pancolitis and toxic megacolon, indicating potential for early abdominal compartment syndrome.
#Hypoxia: She was initially transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for the above findings as well as hypoxia with O2 sat of 70s on RA.
There was concern for aspiration and she was empirically treated with Vanc/Zosyn for aspiration PNA as well as HCAP given her recent admission.
#Thrombocytosis: Plt elevated to over 1,000,000 during her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay, thought to be reactive thrombocytosis in the setting of her sepsis and toxic megacolon.
#Pseudohyperkalemia: [**1-7**] her thrombocytosis as above, potassium was wnl when checked as whole blood sample in green top tube.
#Hypertension: Home BP meds held in the setting of sepsis and hypotension.
