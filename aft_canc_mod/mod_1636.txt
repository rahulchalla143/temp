She continued to have bulky lymphadenopathy both above and below the diaphragm following this treatment, did have slight interval decrease overall with the exception of a slight increase in the size of her lymph nodes in the right supraclavicular chain.
She had an extended hospitalization in [**8-/2130**] for further workup for fever and night sweats.
She also had a lymph node biopsy of the right supraclavicular node in order to rule out transformation of her disease, which was also consistent with CLL without any evidence of transformation.
However, there was note of caseating granuloma concerning for TB.
Of note, she also developed a rash in this setting, which eventually resolved.
However, it was thought to be related to TB, noted to be granuloma annulare on biopsy.
At that point, she was still having high fevers.
Of note, due to a poor tolerability with anorexia, nausea, weight loss, and fatigue, we switched her regimen.

# Transient hypotension:  Patient met SIRS criteria with fever and tachycardia, without clear source for infection and stable blood pressures, after administration of 3L NS in the ED, and with a normal lactate.
During her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course she never had clear localizing symptoms and no known previous indwelling line or hardware, that could explain her fever.
Her recent steroid use and the abrupt discontinuation of this drug may have contributed to her hypotensive episode, but her [**Last Name (un) 104**] stimulation was appropriate, pre ACTH cortisol level 0.9, 18 post ACTH stimulation.
On the evening of [**7-29**], she spiked a temp to 103 and became tachycardic to 130s.
The patient was continued oh her antibiotics and was stable and afebrile upon transfer to 7F.
No obvious source of bleeding was found.
Decresed production as a possible explanation was also in the differential diagnosis.
# Heart Murmur:  No prior documentation of heart murmur was found but a prior ECHO in [**2131**] showed 1+ TR/MR.
[**Name14 (STitle) **] was done which resulted in no vegetations seen and MR was improved from previous study.
# Tachycardia: Patient presented w/ sinus tach to 130s and this initially resolved after administration of IVF.
Pt remained hemodynamically stable without any evidence of hypoxia or SOB.
HR trended down spontaneously with fever resolution.
Hypovolemia was likely the cause of this hyponatremia.
# CLL: Patient has a p53 mutation and is s/p multiple rounds of chemo (last Campath [**10-9**], previously fludarabine-based therapy CVP, CHOP) with continued bulky lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly.
Prophylaxis with fluconazole, vancomycin PO and atovaquone were continued.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Lymphoma Pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with fevers and low blood pressure.
Please contact your oncologist or present to the emergency department if you experience fevers, dizziness, loss of consciousness, cough, shortness of [**Last Name (STitle) 1440**] or any other symptoms that you find concerning.
