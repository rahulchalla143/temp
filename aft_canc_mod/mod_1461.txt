Admission Date:  [**2108-3-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2108-4-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2039-5-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**] Chief Complaint: Bright red blood per rectum  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD Colonscopy Distal Ileocolic Artery embolization IVC filter placement EGD with ERCP  History of Present Illness: HPI: 68 yo M with h/o MDS, thrombocythemia, HTN, COPD (fev1 62% pred, fvc 56% 11/06) p/w BRBPR.
Yesterday PM pt had episode of large vol (not quantified) BRBPR, though no stool, associated with abd cramps.
Has also complained of mild cough and "spitting up" small amounts of blood-tinged sputum.
Otherwise without complaints.
Pt remained hemodynamically throughout.
NGL attempted X 6 but attempts were unsuccessful and pt developed brisk nose bleed.
ROS: As above, also pt denies cp/sob/HA/vision/blance changes/joint or muscle pain or swelling/hematuria.
PROGRESS NOTE ON TRANSFER FROM MICU TO [**Hospital1 **]: 68 yo M with h/o MDS, thrombocythemia, HTN, COPD (fev1 62% pred, fvc 56% 11/06) who presented with BRBPR on [**3-22**].
He reported having a large volume of BRBPR without stool and associated with abdominal cramps.
In the ED, he was hemodynamically stable, NGL attempted but not performed as pt developed nose bleed.
Given his h/o thrombocythemia with clots and the fact that his anti-coagulation was held in the setting of GI bleed, LENIs were performed that showed a chronic appearing L superficial vein DVT.
The pt then began to c/o nausea and increasing abdominal pain and LFTs were significant for an obstructive picture.
A RUQ US showed a thick, edematous GB wall that was concerning for possible cholecystitis and surgery was consulted.
There is moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened/sclerotic, but move well.
Mild aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Influenza A--> "coma" for 21 days ([**2100**]) Pt admitted to [**Hospital1 **] for respiratory distress.
Dignosed w/ influenza or PNA.
RUQ ultrasound showed a hypoechoic pancreas and sludge in the gallbladder.
Incidentally was diagnosed with Anemia and manocytosis so got Bone Marrow Biopsy.
No abnormal localization of immature precursors is found.
4. hemochromocytosis or sideroblastic anemia?
His iron studies revealed an iron of 113, total iron binding capacity of 135, ferritin of greater than 1000 and a TRF of 104.
COPD "breathing much improved since stopped smoking 9 months ago".
Physical Exam: Temp 96.8 BP 105/69 Pulse 77 Resp 14 O2 sat 99 % 2 l NC Gen - Alert, no acute distress HEENT - extraocular motions intact, anicteric, mucous membranes dry Neck - no JVD, no cervical lymphadenopathy Chest - Clear to auscultation bilaterally CV - Normal S1/S2, RRR, no murmurs appreciated Abd - Soft, nontender, mild distended, with normoactive bowel sounds Extr - No edema.
EKG-nsr@79 bpm, twi I/avl (old) .
Hazy opacities in the lower lung regions may be due to crowding of vasculature related to low lung volumes, but it is difficult to exclude peribronchiolar infection or aspiration.
PA and lateral chest radiograph with improved inspiratory volumes may be helpful for more complete assessment of these regions.
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon .
Combined with the patient's history, these findings likely represent a chronic DVT.
Echogenic liver and splenomegaly consistent with intrinsic liver disease.
The gallbladder is not particularly distended and this appearance may be related to liver disease or fluid resuscitation.
There is persistent cardiomegaly.
There are no pleural effusions, consolidations, or pneumothorax.
HIDA [**3-29**] - Findings suggest hepatocellular dysfunction.
Patchy opacities at bilateral lung bases, which may represent atelectasis versus early pneumonia.
No evidence of cholecystitis, colitis or diverticulitis, however multiple mildly enlarged retroperitoneal and root of mesentery lymph nodes are seen which is a nonspecific finding.
However, may be associated with an inflammatory or infectious process.
A dilation was seen at the biliary tree with the CBD measuring 12mm.
There are small echogenic foci peripherally located in the mid pole of the left kidney, which may represent crystals within a caliceal diverticulum.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or mass.
IMPRESSION:  Small echogenic foci within the periphery of the mid pole of the left kidney, which could represent crystals within a caliceal diverticulum.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma following ERCP.
Findings could indicate mild post-ERCP pancreatitis.
Potential DVT in right common and superficial femoral veins.
If determining whether there is DVT in the right lower extremity is of clinical significance, this could be confirmed with Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**].
New right lower extremity DVT extending from the CFV/GSV junction to the popliteal vein.
Redemonstration of left superficial femoral vein DVT .
[**4-5**] ECHO: INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

LABS ON DISCHARGE: WBC 12.9 HGB 7.3 HCT 22.1 PLT 299 NA 133 K 4.2 HCO3 27 BUN 39 CR 1.4 PT 25.1 INR 2.5 ALT 20 AST 22 Total Bili 0.9   Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo M with h/o MDS, thrombocythemia, HTN, COPD who initially presented with BRBPR.
The patient underwent an SMA angiogram which showed bleeding at the distal ileocolic branches, which underwent successful embolization.
His hematocrits are also unresponsive to blood transfusions presumably due to difficult crossmatching.
The patient continued to have intermittent guiac positive stool, but his hematocrit remained stable.
He was discharged with plan to observe for any evidence of acute bleeding or decrease from his baseline hct of 22. .
#) Cholethiasis: The patient was found to have increasing LFTs with abdominal pain.
His LFTs were monitored thereafter and decreased to normal.
#) DVT: Prior to admission, the patient had been on chronic coumadin anticoagulation therapy for history of DVT and splenic vein thrombosis.
On admission with GI bleed, his INR was reversed with 10 mg of vitamin K.  A lower extremity ultrasound demonstrated a chronic left superficial femoral vein thrombosis, and an IVC filter was placed to prevent PE - in the setting of his bleed and having to stop his anticoagulation as well as his antiplatelet agents.
GIB after his ERCP, he was found to have an incidental DVT on his RLE.
#) Acute renal failure: The patient developed acute renal failure during his stay and renal consult suspected it was secondary to contrast dye.
#) Anemia: The patient has myelodysplastic syndrome - from which anemia is the primary manifestation.
The patient's iron studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
THE PATIENT IS A DIFFICULT CROSS MATCH FOR BLOOD BANK DUE TO KNOWN ANTIBODIES.
#) Leukocytosis - The patient periodically had increased WBC during his stay.
He was treated for pneumonia with a 10 day course of levofloxacin.
He continued to have elevated WBC and a nonspecific retrocardiac opacity on CXR.
He has been afebrile and his most recent urine culture was negative for infection.
He has not had any positive blood cultures.
#) Hypoxia: The patient required small amounts of nasal cannula oxygen intermittently after his ICU course, likely secondary to volume overload and atelectasis.
The patient may need lasix on a PRN basis (20 mg IV is suitable dose) if he appears fluid overloaded on exam.
#) Essential thrombocythemia - Patient has history of multiple thromboses due to this disorder.
Cepacol 2 mg Lozenge Sig: One (1) Lozenge Mucous membrane PRN (as needed) as needed for cough.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
