There is also bilateral lower lobe atelectasis also largely unchanged.
There is also minimal pleural fluid extending into the right minor fissure.
There is no pneumothorax.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is obscured by the left lower lobe atelectasis and effusion.
There is no evidence of volume overload.
There is mild dextroconvex thoracic scoliosis.
IMPRESSION: Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and lower lobe atelectasis, both of which are unchanged allowing for slight differences in technique.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Poor R wave progression.
Brief Hospital Course: 87 year old Russian-speaking female with h/o breast cancer, esophageal cancer (requiring esophogeal stent), afib, DMII, s/p EGD with additional stent placement adm with dyspnea and large recurrent right pleural effusion s/p pleurodesis with small volume hematemesis in pulmonary clinic.
She briefly required pressors for hemodynamic support.
GI attending recommended to family that any attempt at further intervention would likely result in massive GI bleeding and catastrophic outcome.
