Admission Date:  [**2137-8-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-8-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-5-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Tetracyclines  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status.
History of Present Illness: Patient is a 62 year old male with past medical history of intracerebral hemorrhage [**6-/2137**], metastatic liver cancer, hypertension,and possible seizures who initially presented to an outside hospital with altered mental status.
They ate dinner and after dinner he complained of a headache.
Shortly thereafter, he apparently tried to get up from a chair and had a fall; this was unwitnessed so unclear if any abnormal movements or seizure activity occurred.
She noted that he seemed weak and tired.
CT scan showed new left sided parieto-occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Intracerebral hemorrhage 8/[**2136**].
Post-hemorrhage he has had episodes of confusion and dysarthria.
Still has residual right sided weakness but is able to ambulate independently.
Hypertension 4.
Liver cancer status post resection with recurrence 3-4 months ago.
Metastatic lesions in lungs.
Asthma 6.
No masses or LAD.
No thyromegaly.
No carotid bruits.
No rebound or guarding.
Chronic skin changes over left lateral leg.
1+pitting edema bilateral LEs and in right hand.
Naming impaired even with low frequency objects.
Moderate dysarthria.
+corneal reflex bilaterally.
Decreased tone right upper extremity.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Sensation: Slow withdrawal to noxious stimuli x4.
Large left parietal hematoma as visualized on the CT scan with surrounding edema.
-------------- CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2137-8-18**]: Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema in the left parietal lobe.
-------------- CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2137-8-21**]: No obvious consolidating pulmonary infiltrates are identified.
The right pleural effusion appears to have increased somewhat in the interval.
-------------- MRI HEAD WITH CONTRAST GADOLIN  [**2137-8-21**]: No significant interval change in the size of a large intraparenchymal hematoma in the left parietal and occipital lobes.
There is no evidence of abnormal vascularity surrounding this hematoma.
There is peripheral enhancement of this hematoma which raises the suspicion of an underlying neoplastic process -------------- CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2137-8-22**]: No significant interval change in a large intraparenchymal hematoma in the left occipital lobe when compared to [**2137-8-20**].
-------------- CHEST (LAT DECUB ONLY)  [**2137-8-22**]: Freely layering moderate right pleural effusion.
------------- CT ABD W&W/O C  [**2137-8-23**]: Findings suggestive of aggressive local recurrence of hepatocellular cancer with invasion through the diaphragm, into the IVC and right atrium, as well as additional masses within the left hepatic lobe, innumerable pulmonary metastases, and large, probably metastatic mass to the right psoas muscle.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 62 year old male with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma and left parietal intracerebral hemorrhage on [**2137-6-26**] who presented with mental status change and right hemiparesis.
Non contrast head CT demonstrated a left parietal hemorrhage with moderate edema.
He was admitted to the neurological ICU on [**2137-8-18**] for blood pressure management and frequent neurological checks.
In light of his history of diffusely metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma, there was concern that his episodes of intracerebral hemorrhage were secondary to bleeding into an underlying mass lesion.
A successful MRI/MRA was obtained on [**2137-8-21**] under conscious sedation and demonstrated an enhancement pattern suspicious for neoplastic disease.
Urinalysis on [**2137-8-20**] was suspicious for early urinary tract infection and the patient was treated with levofloxacin.
The patient had an oxygen requirement until [**8-22**] and chest-x-ray demonstrated a right lower lobe infiltrate so treatment with levofloxacin and clindamycin for presumptive aspiration pneumonia was briefly institued.
Outside hospital records then revealed that the patient had a chronic right pleural effusion so the clindamycin was discontinued.
During his stay, the patient's mental status remained confused and he was intermittenly oriented only to his name.
Because of moderate vasogenic edema seen on imaging, the patient was started on dexamethasone.
CT of the abdomen with and without contrast on [**2137-8-23**] revealed findings suggestive of aggressive local recurrence of hepatocellular cancer with invasion through the diaphragm, into the IVC and right atrium, as well as additional masses within the left hepatic lobe, innumerable pulmonary metastases, and large, probably metastatic mass to the right psoas muscle.
Lactulose was instituted for hepatic encephalopathy.
He has some impairment of comprehension and has difficulty following multistep commands.
PO QD (once a day) as needed for constipation.
Combivent 103-18 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Intraparenchymal brain hemorrhage with likely underlying mass lesion 2.
Hepatocellular Cancer  with metastases to lung, left lobe of liver, infiltrating inferior vena cava/right atrium, right psoas 3.
Hypertension 4.
Asthma   Discharge Condition: Stable; Persistent disorientation, poor comprehension, right sided weakness.
Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor if you have severe headache, vision changes, weakness, numbness or tingling, problems with speech, incoordination, bowel or bladder changes, fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other worrisome symptoms.
