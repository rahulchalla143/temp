Admission Date:  [**2171-10-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-10-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2122-4-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 18369**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea, hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bronch  History of Present Illness: HPI:  49 yo man w/ known renal cell carcinoma with mets to lung admitted w/ worsened dyspnea and hemoptysis.
DDx at that time included lymphangitic spread vs. infection vs toxic reaction, but bronchial washing and tissue bx showed malignant cells.
Since bronch, pt has been having worsening SOB for 3-4 days, pleuritic chest pain, that became acutely worse last night, after eating a snack (nuts and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 2452**]).
He denies any aspiration event or emesis.
He had subjective fevers overnight with persistent coughing, called his PCP who told him to take codeine for cough suppressant and to try to rest.
On day of admission, he still felt unwell and was told to come to the ER for evaluation.
Regarding his hemoptysis, he reported having "specks" of blood in his sputum which turned more bright in color on morning of admission.
His chest pain is post tussive and with shallow breathing.
Although worse over last 24 hours, he feels that his breathing has been getting progressively worse over last few weeks.
Concern for PE warranted evaluation, but given dye allergy/ ARF and abnormal chest xray, options were limited.
Chest CT w/o contrast shows dramatic metastatic lung progression.
He received approx 6 mg total IV morphine w/o significant relief in the ER.
Chest pain is his main discomfort at this time.
*   Past Medical History: PMH: Dx renal cell ([**2170-5-10**]) with abd pain/diarrhea.
CT/MRI at that time with left renal mass.
Path w/ papillary-type renal cell carcinoma measuring 9.1 cm, histologic grade was 3.
There was extensive vascular invasion and tumor present in the peripelvic fat.There were no distant sites involved at that time.
--right axillary dissection [**1-12**] for palplable mass --supraclavicular dissection w/ no clear dx --sought multiple opinions around country and elected to start 17AAG x 2 cycles w/ increased disease, taken off protocol --started SU11248Gemzar [**7-14**] but now w/ mets to lung on bronch done [**10-9**](washings and RLL tissue positive for mets) --Last dose SU011248/Gemcitabine [**2171-9-18**].
Family History: FH: Father w/ CAD and ?lung ca.

Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 49 yo man w/ met renal cell carcinoma to lung now w/ progressive shortness of breath.
Dyspnea: Pt has known metastatic disease in lungs, secondary to lymphangitic spread of renal cell CA.
This is likely etiology of hemoptysis and dyspnea, but other possible etiologies include community acquired or aspiration pneumonia.
PE also concern given malignancy, SOB and tachycardia, but this is very difficult to evaluate given his ARF/contrast allergy (no CTA) and abnormal CXR (no v/q).
-Sputum cultures were consistent with oropharyngeal flora.
Fever: As above for resp symptoms.
No bandemia or signs of sepsis during admission.
- U/a and cx ordered were negative for UTI.
Likely [**3-13**] nephrectomy, chemo and possible disease infiltration.
- Patient was hydrated with IVF for possible pre-renal causes.
5. pain control: while in the ICU, patient's pain was controlled with PCA w/ dilaudid instead as morphine was not well tolerated.
However, patient developed some hallucinations and thus was transitioned to just MS Contin and morphine for breakthrough.
