Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2122-1-15**]: Right sided craniotomy for mass resection   History of Present Illness: 50 year old male with known GBM diagnosed with biopsy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] last year present with severe headache on the night of [**1-12**], which was associated with nausea.
He went to his radiation appointment on [**1-13**] in the morning and was sent for a stat head CT.
The scan showed significant edema around the area of the mass.
For example, when opening the cabinet to get a coffee cup, he would hit his head on the cabinet door.
Recurrent left spontaneous pneumothoraces with left apical blebs, s/p left upper lobe bleb resection, pleurodesis, and sclerosis in [**2105**]; had post operative air leak requiring exploratory thoracotomy 2.
No stroke, hemorrhage, or aneurysm.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift.

A hyperdense rim within the mass may indicate blood products.
There is a marked increase in vasogenic edema surrounding the mass.
There is a mild shift of the septum pellucidum and the third ventricle to the left.

Must be completed Contrast: MAGNEVIST    [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    50 year old man with REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    please evaluate for residual tumor burden.
Provisional Findings Impression: DBH [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**2122-1-16**] 4:20 PM PFI: Status post resection of glioblastoma with no evidence of residual enhancing tumor.
Sagittal and axial short TR, short TE spin echo imaging was performed through the brain.
After administration of 14 ml of Magnevist intravenous contrast, axial imaging was performed with FLAIR, gradient echo, long TR, long TE fast spin echo, diffusion, and short TR, short TE spin echo technique.
FINDINGS: In the interval, the patient has undergone resection of the right temporal and deep white matter masses noted on the prior study.
Although there is a thin rim of enhancement surrounding the surgical site, the best radiologic evidence is that the enhancing neoplasm has been completely resected.
There is expected postoperative hemorrhage at the surgical site and a tiny fluid collection is noted.
There is mild dural thickening, again presumably related to surgery.
Although the enhancing portion of the tumor appeared to reach the ependymal surface of the right lateral ventricle, there is no evidence of intraventricular enhancement to suggest seeding of the tumor.
CONCLUSION: Status post resection of glioblastoma with no evidence of residual enhancing tumor.
Provisional Findings Impression: [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**2122-1-15**] 7:56 PM No major vascular territorial infarction or other acute intracranial abnormality.
There is a small amount of expected post-surgical pneumocephalus and hemorrhage seen in the resection bed.
In addition there is expected bifrontal pneumocephalus.
There is persistent stable edema in the resection bed.
Subgaleal soft tissue edema is noted over the right parietal vertex.
No acute major vascular territory infarction is noted.
IMPRESSION: Expected post-surgical appearance with minimal post-surgical hemorrhage in the resection bed.
No evidence of major vascular territory infarction or new shift of the normally midline structures.
