Admission Date:  [**2166-10-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-11-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-2-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2969**] Chief Complaint: left uper lobe nodule  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2166-10-8**]: 1.
History of Present Illness:   Mr. [**Known lastname 6330**] is a 56-year-old gentleman with greater than 100 pack-year smoking history and severe emphysema with an enlarging spiculated PET positive lesion on the left upper lobe.
He has severe protein calorie malnutrition and severe emphysema.
He has completed pulmonary rehab and gained several pounds suggesting positive nitrogen balance.
A remote metastatic survey was unremarkable and I recommended mediastinal staging and, if node-negative, a segmental anatomic resection as a reasonable compromise for what we suspected was a carcinoma but also considering his severe underlying emphysema.
He had chronic total atelectasis of the left lower lobe with a bronchoscopy in the past excluding an endobronchial lesion so we hoped to recruit some of this.
Evaluate left lower lobe collapse and right upper lobe infiltrate.
A moderate amount of pleural fluid is present in the left hemithorax, and there is a persistent lucency at the left apex, attributed to a hydropneumothorax.
Additional rounded lucencies are seen in the left mid lung zone region and may be due to areas of necrotizing lung parenchyma based on prior CT exam findings.
Heterogeneous opacification persists throughout the right lung as well as a small-to-moderate right pleural effusion.
As compared to the recent study, there has been slight interval increase in degree of opacification in the left hemithorax, which may be due to a combination of worsening atelectasis and increasing pleural effusion.
There is otherwise no significant change since the recent study.
Post op pt was on a small amt of neo for hypotension d/t epidural and weaned and extubated successfully.
Pt was having increased difficulty managing his sections in the successive post op days despite daily and [**Hospital1 **] bronchoscopy pul hygiene.
RESP: His vent wean has been slow but progressive.
Had Citrobacter in sputum which was treated.
Extrem: No C/C/ transient LE edema which is improving.
Calcium Gluconate 2 gm / 100 ml D5W IV PRN free Ca < 1.13 22.
Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 5503**] [**Hospital **] Hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: Left upper lobe lung cancer (pulmonary adenocarcinoma) seizures, Etoh abuse, GERD, SCC.
