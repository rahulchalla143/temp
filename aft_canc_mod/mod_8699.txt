61 year old gentleman with COPD, stage IV NSCLC mucinous adenocarcinoma and recent PE who presents with dyspnea.
He reports sudden-onset worsening of respiratory status on the morning of admission without associated productive cough, fevers/chills, CP, or other symptoms.
His acute respiratory decompensation was attributed to a mucus plug, aspiration, perhaps with contributing atalectasis.
After discharge, blood cultures from [**2173-11-3**] grew Fusobacterium Nucleatum in one out of two bottles.
Repeat blood cultures at his outpatient oncologist failed to reveal positive cultures.
Labs showed hyponatremia with a sodium of 129, otherwise unremarkable CMP.
CXR showed Stable right-sided pleural effusion and post-obstructive consolidation, increasing left pleural effusion with basal atelectasis.
Patient had his pleurex catheter drained with 300 cc's of straw colored fluid aspirated.
No antibiotics were given as low suspicion for acute infection.
In addition, as a large component of dyspnea was anxiety, patient was placed on standing clonazepam 1mg TID.
