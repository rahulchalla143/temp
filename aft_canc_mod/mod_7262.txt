Brief Hospital Course: 85M with h/o CLL and many recent admissions to [**Hospital1 18**], recently for pneumonias (aspergillus and citrobacter) and recurrent UTIs (pseudomonas, VRE, E.coli), presenting from rehab facility with lethargy and fever, found to have pseudomonas bacteremia.
On admission, UA was grossly positive however urine culture returned with no growth.
Initially patient was covered with linezolid, ciprofloxacin and meropenem (double coverage), given his urine culture history.
A blood culture from admission grew pseudomonas, sensitive to ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin (not [**Last Name (un) 2830**] or cefepime), and so antibiotics were switched to ceftazidime.
PICC remained in place given poor access and GNR bacteremia (not GPCs).
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Patient was initially transferred for urinary retention, however with placement of foley only minimal fluid was drained.
ATN was believed to be due to hypotension from sepsis.
# Afib: This admission he was started on amiodarone for persistent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and often accompanied by low blood pressures.
At the time of transfer from the ICU, he was in atrial fibrillation with blood pressures in the 80s but per discussion with the family (see below) no further medications were administered as this was not in keeping with his goals of care.
# Goals of Care: Patient was having waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] levels of alertness during his last few days in the ICU and expressed some desire to be left alone so discussion was initiated with the family regarding goals of care.
[**Name (NI) **] wife described the lengthy battle he has fought with his underlying CLL and understood that his prognosis at this time was quite poor.
He was transferred to the floor as DNR/DNI, no escalation of care.
IV antibiotics were continued per the family's wishes, but oral medications were discontinued as his mental status declined, and focus was on comfort and symptom management.
