Two new pulmonary nodules within the right lung.
Given patient's high- risk status of emphysema, a CT chest in 3 months after drainage of right pleural effusion is recommended for further evaluation.
Probable distal CBD stones in which ERCP would be both confirmatory and theraputic.
Three-vessel coronary artery calcification.
Prominent left axillary lymph node.
Right-sided pleural thickening presumably associated with old rib fractures.
cytology pleural fluid-Pleural fluid:    NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Mesothelial cells, histiocytes, and lymphocytes.
Persistent moderate-to-large right-sided pleural effusion.
Persistent pulmonary nodules within the right lung.
Left axillary and pretracheal lymph node which is enlarged.
There is significant interval increase in the multi-loculated right pleural effusion with almost complete atelectasis of the right lower lobe and to a lesser extent of the right upper lobe as described above.
No pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
There is extensive coronary atherosclerosis noted.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 72M with ESRD on HD, HTN, DM2, PAD, CMML, diastolic dysfunction presented with pleural effusion.
Decompensated in setting of SVT during dialysis, now resolved.
On the day of admission, while at HD, the pt became very tachycardic (SVT to the 150s, ?
atrial flutter) and had associated chest pain radiating to the jaw and diaphroesis.
His tachycardia converted back to sinus rhythm.
Results were consistent with an exudative pleural effusion.
Repeat chest CT demonstrated persistent pleural effusion, and a CTA on the day of transfer to the ICU demonstrated significant interval increase in pleural effusion with almost complete atelectasis of the RLL.
Upon transfer to the ICU, the pt did not have any complaints other than some mild wheezing.
He denied chest or jaw pain, shortness of breath, diaphroesis or nausea.
There was no evidence of PE on CTA.
He had a significant travel history, but reports a negative PPD in the past.
There was no pneumonic infiltrate, no fever and no white count to suggest an underlying pneumonia.
His Hct has been stable, although the fluid did reaccumulate so fast that a hemothorax [**1-18**] a complication of the initial thoracentesis.
While in the ICU he became hypotensive to 70's requiring 3L of IVF and also was noticed to have a HCT to 24 for which he was transfused 2 units PRBCs.
He was started on vanc/zosyn for broad coverage but this was discontinued after his BP stabilized and there was no evidence of infection.
He had his chest tube removed without inciddent and a follow up CXR did not show reaccumulation.
Wet read on his pathology from VATS showed reactive histiocytosis, fibrinous changes, no evidence of CMML involvement or pulmonary/mesothelial malignancy.
#hypotension-pt was hypotensive to 70's one night in ICU after HD and after OR procedures.
Etiology likely secondary to hypovolemia.
Other possibilities included infection/sepsis and/or med effect from OR.
#atrial flutter: Pt had chest discomfort, jaw pain when HD began, HR increased to SVT at 150s (likely atrial flutter).
There are no ischemic changes on EKG, and his cardiac enzymes are at his baseline.
EKG was done with no ischemic changes.
He had an echo to look for wall motion abnormalities, which showed an EF of >55%, no new wall motion abnormalities.
# ESRD: Has not been able to undergo adequate HD sessions due to atypical CP and then hypotension recently.
# CMML: not active, unlikely to cause pleural effusion .
# Code status: FULL CODE  ********* On day of discharge pt's WBC 16, had been fluctuating during hospitalization, possibly due to CMML.

You were found to have a fluid collection at your right lung base.
While you were hospitalized you had a thoracentesis, a procedure to remoce some of that fluid from your lungs for therapeutic relief and diagnosis.
You had repeat shortness of breath, had a chest tube placed which found bloody fluid.
You had a temporary run of an irregular heart rhythm (NSVT).
Please seek medical attention if you have any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizzyness, coughing or any other concerning symptoms.
