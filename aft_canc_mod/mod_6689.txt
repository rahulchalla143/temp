Provisional Findings Impression: GMdb MON [**2116-2-17**] 3:35 PM Findings suggestive of a small amount of residual neoplasm along the margins of the operative cavity.
Acute ischemia along the posterior and inferior margin of the operative cavity.
There has also been interval resection of enhancing lesion in the right parietotemporal region.
There is hemorrhage in the operative bed, which is an expected postoperative occurrence.
There does appear to be some nodular enhancement, particularly along the anterior margin of the operative bed, which is concerning for residual neoplasm.
There is also probable small amount of residual enhancing lesion along the right periatrial region.
There is a right hemispheric extra-axial collection, which is postoperative.
There is a wedge-shaped focus of restricted diffusion along the posterior margin of the operative cavity, which is suggestive of acute ischemia.
There is also another focus of acute ischemia in the right temporal lobe, along the inferior margin of the cavity.
There is a right frontal ventricular catheter with its tip in the midline.
There is air-fluid level in the sphenoid sinus.
There are scattered bilateral ethmoid air cells, which are opacified.
IMPRESSION:  Postoperative sequela in the right temporoparietal region with possible foci of residual neoplasm as above.
Acute ischemia along the posterior and inferior margin of the operative cavity.

Wet Read Audit # 1 FBr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**2116-2-16**] 2:58 PM new focus of hemorrhage in the right parietal mass measuring 31 x29 mm.
The mass in the right parietal lobe is associated with moderate vasogenic edema which unchnaged since mR of the [**2116-1-28**].
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is a new hemorrhagic focus in the right parietal lobe measuring 31 x 29 mm.
Extensive vasogenic edema is noted around the hemorrhagic focus.
The mass lesion of the right temporoparietal lesion is not visualized in this non-contrast study, however, there are partial rim- like areas of hyperdensity at the expected location of the mass, which represents surrounding hemorrhagic focus as seen on the prior MRI.
Diffuse vasogenic edema with surrounding obliteration of the sulci of the right hemisphere is noted.
There is a 6-mm shift of midline structure, which is unchanged compared to the prior study.
The left hemisphere does not demonstrate any acute pathology including hemorrhage or infarction.
The ventricles and sulci in the left hemisphere are mildly prominent consistent with involutional changes.
There is mild mucosal thickening of the right maxillary and posterior ethmoid sinuses.
IMPRESSION: New focus of hemorrhage within the right parietal lobe measuring 31 x 29 mm.
This area of bleeding is noted medial to the expected location of known tumor of the right temporoparietal fossa.
Extensive surrounding vasogenic edema and shift of midline structure is unchanged.
He was brought to the OR emergently for resection of hemorrhagic tumor by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
