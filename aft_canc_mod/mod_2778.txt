CT abd [**2142-5-18**]: IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of hematoma or abscess.
2) Hypodense areas in the liver consistent with post-RF ablation changes.
3) Focus of enhancement adjacent to the right lobe RF ablations site, raising concern for persistent hepatoma.
4) Likely bibasilar atelectasis, although the presence of infection cannot be entirely excluded.
RUQ Ultrasound ([**2142-5-18**]) IMPRESSION: 1) Multiple areas of heterogeneous echotexture consistent with prior RF ablations sites.
2) No intra or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
