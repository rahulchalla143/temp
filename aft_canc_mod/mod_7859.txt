Repair aorta repair vena cava  History of Present Illness: (Per endocrinology) Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 66-year-old man with a history significant for paraganglionoma who was admitted for volume expansion the night prior to resection of a right paraganglionoma.
To review his history, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65-year-old man who as part of the work up for a right inguinal hernia was found to have a 7.7 cm retroperitoneal mass.
Pathology was consistent with a paraganglioma.
The features were consistent with a paraganglioma.
Laboratory studies performed in [**Month (only) **] were significant for increased plasma and urinary normetanephrine and metanephrine catecholamines (see under labs).
The results demonstrated the presence of an intense uptake of tracer seen within the mid-abdomen, consistent with known paraganglioma.
There were no other foci concerning for additional disease.
In addition, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was found to have an incidental thyroid nodule on the chest CT performed in [**Month (only) **] as part of the work up for the paraganglioma.
A subsequent thyroid US showed a dominant 3 cm solid nodule located on the left thyroid lobe.
Calcitonin level, which was WNL, was also checked to rule out medullary thyroid carcinoma.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: General: no weight changes or fatigue.
No fever or chills.
HEENT: no headaches, visual changes, or double vision.
No neck pain or tenderness.
Cardiovascular: no chest pain, no palpitations, no dyspnea on exertion.
Lungs: no shortness of breath, no cough.
Gastrointestinal: no abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.
Genitourinary: no dysuria, urgency, or frequency.
Musculoskeletal: no muscle or joints pain, muscular weakness, or cramps.
Neurologic: no tremors, paresthesias, difficulties with memory, sensory or motor disturbances.
Psychiatric: denies depressed mood or anhedonia.
Hypercholesterolemia 3.
Hypertension 4.
Inguinal hernia 6.
Thyroid nodule  PSH: CT guided biopsy of retroperitoneal mass  Social History: Patient came to US in [**2173**] from [**Last Name (LF) 91211**], [**First Name3 (LF) 11150**].
No smoking (of any kind), alcohol, or other drugs.
No history of any endocrine diseases or tumor syndromes.
Physical Exam: ON DISCHARGE: Vitals: General: NAD HEENT: NC/AT, no exophthalmus, no lid lag, EOMs intact, PERRL, MMM Neck: No bruits, small thyroid nodule on left side Heart: RRR, no m/r/g, normal S1 and S2 Lungs: CTAB Abdomen: bowel sounds present, soft, NT/ND, no abd bruits, no CVAT Extremities: no c/c/e, w/w/p, moves all Neuro: No tremor noted.
PRE-OP CXR [**2190-1-21**]: IMPRESSION -> No evidence of acute disease.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
VIDEO SWALLOW [**2190-2-4**]: FINDINGS: A mild-to-moderate amount of residue remained in the valleculae after all oral boluses, that was increased with increasing bolus density.
There was possible single episode of trace aspiration of nectar-thick liquids as well.
IMPRESSION: Penetration with nectar-thick liquids and possible single episode of silent aspiration of nectar thick liquids.
CT HEAD [**2190-2-5**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
If clinical concern persists for ischemic stroke, would recommend further evaluation with an MRI.
EEG [**2190-2-6**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG because of diffuse background slowing and intermittent bifrontal slowing.
These findings are indicative of a diffuse encephalopathy of non-specific etiology.
In addition, there were intermittent triphasic waves in the second half of the recording which can be seen in metabolic encephalopathies although they are not specific as to pathology either.
No epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures are present.
There is plate-like atelectasis in both lower lungs.
There is no focal infiltrate.
No evidence of acute infarct or hemorrhage.
Cystic lesion in the right middle ear/mastoid may represent fluid.
Mucus retention cyst and mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus and fluid in the bilateral mastoid air cells.
LABS PRIOR TO DISCHARGE: [**2190-2-10**] 04:39AM BLOOD WBC-8.4 RBC-2.88* Hgb-8.7* Hct-25.1* MCV-87 MCH- 30.2 MCHC-34.5 RDW-14.5 Plt Ct-382 [**2190-2-10**] 04:39AM BLOOD Glucose-137* UreaN-16 Creat-0.8 Na-134 K-4.2 Cl-101 HCO3-23 AnGap-14 [**2190-2-10**] 04:39AM BLOOD ALT-32 AST-28 LD(LDH)-200 AlkPhos-118 TotBili-0.5 [**2190-2-10**] 04:39AM BLOOD Albumin-3.0* Calcium-8.5 Phos-3.5 Mg-2.1  Brief Hospital Course: This 66 year-old male with a right paraganglionoma causing blood pressures abnormalities was admitted [**2190-1-21**] for pre-operative volume expansion.
His surgery was complicated by volatile blood pressure due to the nature of the tumor itself, as well as excessive bleeding requiring transfusion.
His postoperative course was complicated by ileus, delirium, and acute SOB/tachypnea and he transferred to SICU on [**1-28**] for further monitoring.
While in SICU, he was intubated for 3 days due to concern of ARDS and given lasix for volume overload.
BAL on [**1-29**] grew pan sensitive E. Coli and psuedomonas.
Neurology was consulted due to persistent aletered mental status on [**2190-2-5**].
A CT head and MRI were obtained and essentially negative for acute process or signs of infarct.
An EEG was also performed which did not show any focal seizure activity,  Speech and swallow evaluated the patient, with recommendations for aspiration precautions, honey thickened liquids and pureed solids.
Due to continued poor PO intake a dobhoff tube was placed with the initiation of continuous tube feeds for nutritional support.
Patient was seen by ENT for hypophonia, and found to have noted paralysis of his Left Vocal Cord, thought to be most likely secondary to his intubation.
Patient did have elevated blood sugars postoperatively, he was started on an insulin regmien and was given NPH 30 units in the AM and 30 units in the PM.
His pain was well controlled.
He still had poor PO intake but was getting his tube feeds cycled per nutrition recs.
His component of hypoactive delirium will likely take several weeks, possibly months to resolve.
)(s)* Refills:*0* 12. docusate sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Glucometer test strips Patient will need strips for his glucometer for his blood sugar checks.
20. metoprolol tartrate 100 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day: for high blood pressure.
Hypertension Post op respiratory failure and sepsis Pneumonia Wound seroma Vocal cord paresis  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
During the postoperative period you experienced some issues with your breathing which required sending you to the critical care unit and a tube being placed down your throat to help you breath.
We believe that you might aspirated some food causing an infection in your lungs.
Your blood was found to have an infection with a bacteria which we treated with a medication (antibiotic).
You were seen by the Neurologists and found to have a hypoactive delirium, we expect you to make a gradual recovery from this.
Wound care: You will need to place a moistened gauze (use sterile saline) into your wound once a day.
