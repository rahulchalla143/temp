[**2161-3-10**] - CXR - Residual vs. recurrent air space disease in the right lower lobe as detailed above.
No evidence of a central venous thrombus.
Multifocal predominantly peribronchial ground glass change bilaterally.
Left upper lobe spiculated mass and mediastinal lymphadenopathy again appreciated.
New right adrenal lesion worrisome for metastasis.
Apparent new right renal mid pole hypodensity is of unclear etiology.
[**2161-3-11**] - CXR - 1) Rapidly evolving bilateral interstitial process, which may be due to interstitial edema from fluid overload considering history of recent hydration.
Atypical pneumonia is also possible in the appropriate clinical setting.
2) Peripheral left upper lobe lung nodule is suggestive of lung cancer.
[**2161-3-12**] - Echo - no definite vegetations seen (suboptimal study); basal inferior posterior infarct; mild aortic stenosis CHEST PORT.
LINE PLACEMENT  [**2161-3-15**] FINDINGS: interval development bibasilar patchy opacities concerning for underlying evolving pneumonia.
There is a persistent focal opacity along the lateral aspect of the left hemithorax may reflect underlying focal atelectasis and/or pneumonia.
No pneumothorax is seen.
EGD [**2161-3-15**] Findings: Zenker's diverticulum noted- making esophageal intubation difficult.
Post-bulbar duodenum appeared normal.

Diverticulosis with no evidence of diverticulitis.
New mass in right adrenal gland concerning for metastatic disease TTE (Complete) [**2161-3-18**] IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-3-16**], at least moderate mitral regurgitation and right ventricular cavity enlargement/free wall hypokinesis is now seen.
If clinically indicated, a TEE would be better able to define the mitral valve structure and clarify the severity of mitral regurgitation.
ECG [**2161-3-18**] Sinus rhythm; Atrial and ventricular ectopic activity; Leftward axis; Right bundle branch block; Inferior T wave changes are nonspecific; Low QRS voltages in precordial leads; Since previous tracing of [**2161-3-15**], atrial fibrillation resolved CXR [**2161-3-20**] IMPRESSION: Small right pleural effusion has decreased and previous mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has improved since [**3-18**].
LLL atelectasis and moderate cardiomegaly persists.
Increasing opacification of LUL is probably a combination of asymmetric residual edema and atelectasis following tracheal extubation.
Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads follow their expected courses.
No pneumothorax.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2161-3-22**] There is a left-sided dual-lead pacemaker.
There is mild left ventricular prominence.
There is prominence of the pulmonary vascular markings suggestive of pulmonary edema.
There is a focal area of opacity in the right lung field which is likely due to edema, however a developing infiltrate cannot be excluded.

Persistent small right basilar atelectasis is again noted.
There has been interval improvement in still mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
There are bibasilar atelectasis.
Ill-defined opacity in the left mid lung has markedly improved.
Patient's known lung cancer located in LUL is partially obscured by the body of the pacemaker and the previously described ill-defined opacity in the left mid lung.
Right pleural effusion is small.
Brief Hospital Course: ONCOLOGY SERVICE COURSE [**3-12**] - [**3-18**]: 86 yo male, h/o CAD s/p stenting, SVT s/p PPM, with recently diagnosed bronchogenic lung cancer with mets to spine, admitted from [**Hospital3 **] with change in mental status, rash, and right upper extremity swelling.
CXR with resolving PNA, and repeat after hydration showed interstitial process .
He also has a hematoma on that side.
Acneiform rash: Pt has a acneform rash on face and right arm, which was not present week prior to admission.
Cough: Pt with cough on exam initially and CXR showed resolving PNA .
[**Hospital Unit Name 13533**]:  [**Date range (1) 38624**] Mr. [**Known lastname 26453**] is an 86 yo male with h/o CAD s/p stent, SVT s/p pacer, AAA repair, recently diagnosed metastatic lung CA who is transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with coffee-ground emesis x 2 days and dropping HCT.
Patient underwent emergent endoscopy early on [**3-15**] which showed large blood clot visible in duodenal bulb- protruding from pylorus.
Post-bulbar duodenum appeared normal.
Pt kept intubated [**2-14**] to tenuous status and difficulty of intubation.
CXR [**3-15**] showed evidence of possible new bibasilar lung process concerning for PNA.
Pt now has copius thick yellow secretions requiring hourly suction.
Sputum Cx positive for GNR.
Patient then became hypotensive on [**3-15**] with low grade temp.
On [**3-17**], pt noticed to have increased pain to palpation of his abdomen on morning rounds.
Abdominal CT performed showing perforation of duodenal ulcer with free air in the peritoneum.
Stress dose steroids and pressors were given during the procedure.
Patient quickly became hypotensive after the surgery to SBP of 78, aggressivly resusitated w/ fluids receiving 6L.
Patient had persistent tachyarrhythmia, pacer interrogated [**3-18**].
1) Duodenal Perforation:  s/p emergent surgery.
Degree of abdominal tenderness on exam significantly improved.
With fluid resuscitation patient has shown improvement of metabolic acidosis.
3) Respiratory Failure ??????
CXR [**3-15**] showed evidence of possible new bibasilar lung process concerning for PNA.
Pt now has copius thick yellow secretions requiring hourly suction.
Sputum Cx positive for GNR.
Feel that some degree of hypertension is agitation related.
4) Acute renal failure: Creatinine increased to 1.6 since prior day from a baseline of 1.0, possible prerenal etiology in the setting of emesis and hypovolemia.
5) Tachyarrhythmia: Patient with known h/o SVT, with pacer, now presents in rapid afib in the setting of volume depletion, which resolved w/ fluids.
Plan to rehydrate + IV digoxin load for rate control; cardiology felt rhythm to be afib with ectopy and believed pacer to be functioning adequately; nature of pacer firing different following OR, and was turned off during procedure, EP to interrogate pacer to see if firiting adequatly .
6) Squamous Cell Lung CA:  Stage IV disease with known metastates to vertebrae.
Plan to discontinue ASA, Plavix in the setting of active GIB; hold Nifedipine in the setting of HD instability; rise in troponins likely from demand ischemia w/ renal failure, as ratio not elevated; continue to trend cardiac enzymes, no evidence of MI on EKG.
SURGICAL SERVICE COURSE [**3-18**] - [**3-26**] On [**3-18**], pt underwent an emergent exploratory laparotomy w/ repair of a perforated duodenal ulcer (please refer to operative note for details).
He was in chronic AFib but was rate-controlled.
A repeat ECHO on [**3-24**] demonstrated an EF of 30%-35%, moderate global left ventricular systolic dysfunction, moderate mitral regurgitation and mild aortic regurgitation.
On [**3-25**], he began exhibiting tachypnea and respiratory distress.
EKG did not demonstrate significant changes from previous tracings.
He shortly became asystolic and expired.
A speech and swallow consult was called for evaluation of his decreased speech volume/ability.
However, on [**3-25**] he had progressive tachypnea to 40's.
A G-tube study on [**3-24**] demonstrated a patent G-tube and J-tube without evidence of leak.
His urine output dramatically declined during his episode of rapid decompensation on [**3-25**] and he eventually went into renal failure w/ anuria and a creatinine of 1.8. .
At that point he had been afebrile and had no elevated WBC.
The senior surgical resident in-house, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 33888**], kept Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] appraised of the patient's decline in status throughout the evening/early morning.
