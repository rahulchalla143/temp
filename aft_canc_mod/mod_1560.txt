Admission Date:  [**2112-4-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2112-4-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2055-5-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: Headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: This is a 56 yo male with recently diagnosed glioblastoma s/p biopsy [**3-30**], who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED with now with R sided weakness, HA, nausea, vomiting since this am.
He had been on dexamethasone since diagnosis with GBM and was seen by his neuro oncologist [**4-11**] who initiated dexamathasone taper.
He noted difficulty with fine motor skills starting the first day of the taper the symptoms progressed to short term memory difficulties yesterday.
This morning he awoke with a headache which gradually worsened, prompting him to present to the ED.
Diagnosis of GBM dates to [**2-/2112**] when he noted difficulty [**Location (un) 1131**], [**3-28**] he presented to the ED with loss of peripheral vision in the right eye, MRI showed left occipital lesion and he underwent biopsy showing Grade 4 glioblastoma.
Head CT notable for new midline shift, marked amount of edema.
He complained of [**6-24**] headache unchanged since arrival to the floor.
He was lethargic and responded to simple commands but had poor concentration and short term memory.
Hypertension 3.
Dyslipidemia 4.
Mitral valve insufficiency and prolapse 5.
Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: Moving all extremieites warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no edema NEURO: limited due to pateint participation.
Significant interval increase in left frontoparietal vasogenic edema with interval development of 5-mm of rightward midline shift, as above.
Left parietal postoperative changes with likely interval increase in intracranial hemorrhage, areas of higher density may reflect retractile clot.
Small focus of regional gas likely relates to post-biopsy change.
Increased hypodensity and expansion of the splenium of the corpus callosum raises concern for increased edema with known underlying mass.
Compression of the body and atrium of the left lateral ventricle due to adjacent edema; small focus of hyperdensity in this region raises concern for small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage versus choroid plexus.
There is minimal left base atelectasis/scarring.
No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.
No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
IMPRESSION: Minimal left base atelectasis.
[**2112-4-15**] MRI Head: There has been progressive worsening of mass effect, edema, and hemorrhage compared to the prior examination, within the mass centered in the left parietal lobe and crossing the splenium of the corpus callosum.
There is progressive effacement of adjacent sulci with progressive vasogenic edema.
The tumor itself also appears larger compared to the [**2112-3-28**] MRI, with expansion of the tumor and less well defined, but more extensive, predominantly peripheral enhancement.
There is worsening mass effect on the adjacent structures, including particularly the atrium of the left lateral ventricle.
There is abnormal increased FLAIR signal within the subarachnoid space of the posterior fossa and parietal lobes, which is concerning for subarachnoid hemorrhage.
A right maxillary sinus mucus retention cyst is again incidentally noted.
IMPRESSION: Compared to the prior examinations, particularly the [**2112-3-28**] MRI, there has been increase in mass effect, hemorrhage and edema compatible with growth of and hemorrhage within the left parietal glioblastoma.
Brief Hospital Course: 56 yoM with recently diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme admitted with left sided weakness and new midline shift on head CT in the setting of tapering steroids.
# Glioblastoma: Recently diagnosed as grade 4 glioblastoma by biopsy [**2112-3-30**].
Repeat head CT showed interval worsening left frontal and parietal edema with new right shift of the frontal horns/anterior third ventricle.
Exam notible for lethargy and poor concentration and R>L weakness in upepr extremity.
He underwent MRI which showed interval increase in the size of the tumor.
He was felt to be a poor candidate for radiation therapy due to brain swelling and intracranial pressure.
Chemotherapy could be considered 2-4 weeks if remains stable due to recent biopsy and increased intracranial pressures.
He was evaluated by neurosurgery at [**Hospital1 2025**] (second opinion) and decided to be an appropriate transfer for further evaluation and management in consideration for neurosurgical approach.
# Bradycardia: EKG showed sinus bradycardia.
Bradycardia is likely related to increased intracranial pressure.
Pressures remained in systolics 100-120s without treatment.
5. butalbital-acetaminophen-caff 50-325-40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for headache.
6. hydromorphone 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for headache.
HYDROmorphone (Dilaudid) 0.25 mg IV Q4H:PRN Severe headache   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Brain mass Increased intracranial pressure  Discharge Condition: AOx [**1-17**] - name and hospital Level of Consciousness: Lethargic but arousable.
You had evidence of edema in your brain causing elevated pressures.
