Admission Date:  [**2154-8-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-8-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2089-12-31**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Caffeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Episodic confusion and memory loss  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left Sided Craniotomy for Tumor Resection   History of Present Illness: Asked to evaluate this 64 year old white female sent in from OSH for new brain mass.
She reports that she has been having headaches for months.
Recall: poor memory - mixed component of long and short term memory difficulties Language: Speech fluent with good comprehension and repetition.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
Visual fields are grossly full to confrontation although she is having difficulty with this as she is very upset.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Significant residual lesion in the left temporal lobe and residual enhancing lesion in the left thalamus.The T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity surrounding the resection cavity is unchanged.
Expected postoperative changes in the left temporoparietal region including resection cavity with hemorrhage and associated extra-axial fluid collection.
There is no evidence of infarction.
CT Head [**8-21**] post-op Post operative changes in the left temporo-parietal region with minimal blood products and air in the resection bed.
Minimal pneumocephalus also seen overlying the left frontal lobe.
No large intracranial hemorrhage.
No acute large vascular territorial infarction.
Persistent compression of left lateral ventricle, effacement of left sulci, and slight righward shift of midline structures, not significantly changed.
Functional MRI [**8-13**] Unchanged intra-axial mass lesion in the left temporal, parietal  and occipital lobes with no significant change since the most recent study.
The ASL sequence demonstrates areas of avid perfusion and also necrotic changes.
The functional MRI demonstrates the expected activation areas in the primary motor cortex during the movement of the hands and feet, a few scattered foci of activation are demonstrated anterior to the mass lesion during the movement of the right hand, possibly related with deviation of the activation anteriorly and also venous contamination, similar findings are demonstrated posterior to the mass lesion in the occipital lobe during the movement of the tongue.
The language paradigm demonstrates the majority of the activation in the left operculum and left Broca's area, likely related with dominance.
MRI Head [**8-12**]  5.7 x 4.1 x 2.5 cm lobulated, mixed solid + cystic mass in L parieto-occipital region.
Heterog enhancement with scattered areas of slow diffusion + hemorrhage.
Diffuse surrounding vasogenic edema extending to L frontal and temporal lobes, w/ 5-mm subfalcine and uncal herniation as before.
Findings concerning for infiltrative glioma.
CT Head [**8-11**] Heterogeneity, cystic chagne in L temporal/parietal lobes w/ vasogenic edema, concerning for infiltrative glioma.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 90837**] was admitted to the neurosurgery service for further workup of a left parietal brain mass.
An MRI was obtained and this was consistent with 5.7x4.1x2.5 cm left parietal mass with vasogenic edema.
A CT Torso was obtained to evaluate for metastatic disease hich was negative.
On [**8-14**] - [**8-16**] she remained stable on the floor with word finding difficulties and issues with naming objects.
She went to the OR on 8.16 for biopsy and resection of her lesion.
On the morning of [**8-21**](POD #1) her exam was stable from pre-op with slightly worse perseveration as well as some left parietal symptoms.
Discharge Medications: 1. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain fever.
7. polyvinyl alcohol-povidone 1.4-0.6 % Dropperette Sig: [**1-6**] Drops Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dryness.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7665**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Left sided brain tumor Altered Mental Status, acute delirium due to cerebral mass.
Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
