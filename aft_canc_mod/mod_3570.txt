Admission Date:  [**2171-10-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-11-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2149-1-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3619**] Chief Complaint: Transfer for tracheostomy & PEG tube placement  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Tracheostomy PEG tube placement Lumbar Puncture Red blood cell transfusion Platelet transfusion Chemotherapy   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 22yo male with PMH significant for mediastinal germ cell tumor with airway obstruction s/p cycle 3 of cisplatin & etoposide ([**Date range (1) 32684**])who presents for elective tracheostomy & PEG tube placement.
Patient initially presented to OSH in respiratory distress and was found to have an anterior mediastinal mass on CXR, confirmed by CT.
According to family, patient was in his usual state of health until he started to have generalized symptoms 6 months prior to presentation to OSH including sore throat, cough, and respiratory symptoms.
Patient had been treated for 2 weeks for bronchitis without resolution.
At [**Hospital1 2177**], patient was intially intubated with double lumen ETT for acute respiratory distress.
Patient had multiple episodes of desaturation requiring intervention with bronchoscopy for better ETT positioning.
On bronchoscopy, the anterior mass was noticed to cause tracheal narrowing and obstruction of the mainstem bronchi bilaterally.
Course complicated by bilateral pneumothoraces requiring bilateral chest tube placement which were d/c'ed on [**8-24**] and [**8-25**].
Patient was extubated on [**8-23**] but reintubation on [**8-30**] due to hypercarbic respiratory failure.
He was reintubated (nasotracheal tube) in OR with bronchoscopy to remove mucous plugging in right middle and lower lobes.
He underwent an ultrasound guided biopsy of his anterior mediastinal mass on [**7-23**].
Given elevated AFP (4093 on [**7-23**]) and biopsy of undifferentiated carcinoma, patient was treated for germ cell tumor with neoadjuvant cisplatin and etoposide from [**Date range (1) 73635**].
Patient prophylaxed for TLS with alopurinol, dexamethasone, and IV fluids.
Chemotherapy complicated by pancytopenia and neutropenic fever, requiring PRBC transfusions on Neupogen.
Cycle 2 of chemotherapy delayed due to development of Pseudomonas sepsis and ARF.
Both were continued with the addition of fluconazole for neutropenic precautions following chemotherapy.
Patient then developed an abscess in his R groin at the site of a prior line which was I&Ded by surgery on [**8-16**] and was also the source of the above mentioned MDR pseudomonas sepsis.
Patient had pseudomonas in blood, urine, and R groin abscess cultures.
Also started on Amikacin for Pseudomonas in sputum and urine.
C diff was negative x 3 and was thought to be secondary to chemotherapy.
A CT scan was obtained on [**9-15**] showing ileocecal thickening and ?
typhlitis (necrotizing enterocolitis) as well as some ?
intusseception fo ascending colon, although there was no evidence of obstruction.
With persisting fevers patient was continued on Cefepime, Amikacin, for pseudomonas in sputum and urine.
[**Hospital **] hospital course was also complicated by ARF thought to be secondary to pseudomonas sepsis and hypotension on [**8-8**].
Patient developed poor UOP and lasix gtt started with poor response.
Patient eventually required CVVH for volume overload on [**8-11**] with 6L removal, and on [**8-15**] with 4L removal.
Quinton eventually clotted on [**8-25**] and he recent emergent dialysis through a newly placed left femoral line.
He then went to IR for possible L quinton placement for HD, but was discovered to have bilat DVTs in IJs which prevented placement.
He eventually responded to 140 mg IV lasix with good UOP on [**8-29**] and the L femoral line was d/c'ed to prevent further infection.
Past Medical History: # Germ cell tumor in mediastinum - s/p 2 rounds of chemotherapy # pancytopenia [**3-15**] chemotherapy   Social History: Patient was a student at [**State 1558**] in accounting.
Infectious Disease Data: [**2171-7-28**]: VAP/[**Month (only) **] Neuropenia (cefepime/Vanc/Fluc)  - (cefepime changed to Zosyn) for Achromobacter in sputum [**2171-8-16**]: R Groin Abscess - MDR Pseudomonas (Gent and Cefepime) Date?

IMAGING: [**10-1**] CXR: IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**9-17**] through [**9-20**]: Infiltrative abnormality right mid and lower lung zones with the suggestion of nodular coalescence as well as multiple nodules in the left lower lobe and lingula have all increased extent since [**9-20**] consistent with lymphoma and/or infection.
The extent of severe adenopathy in the upper mediastinum has not changed appreciably.
Tip of the upper tracheal tube is at the level of the sternal notch, approximately 2 cm higher than previously.
[**10-2**] KUB:  No evidence of obstruction is noted.
Amount of bilateral perihilar streaky opacities is improved since most recent examination likely reflecting resolving atelectasis or edema.
Mild left lower lobe atelectasis persists.
No evidence of pneumothorax or large effusions.
IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement to perihilar opacities likely reflect resolving atelectasis or edema.
Persistent mild left lower lobe opacity.
CONCLUSION: Multiple small enhancing lesions within the cerebral hemispheres, but apparently sparing the posterior fossa structures.
Given the history of a malignancy elsewhere, hemorrhagic metastatic lesions (where susceptibility is seen) are suspected.
IMPRESSION: Since [**2171-10-12**], increase in size of right parietal leptomeningeal metastasis as well as the right frontal and left superior parietal metastases.
No significant change in size of small metastases involving the left centrum semiovale and the left occipital lobe.
IMPRESSION: No spinal metastases seen.
A focus of hyperintensity on T1 and T2 but not on STIR likely represents focal fat or hemangioma in the L5 vertebral body.
[**2171-10-23**]: Head MRI MPRESSION:  Since [**2171-10-12**], increase in size of right parietal leptomeningeal metastasis as well as the right frontal and left superior parietal metastases.
No significant change in size of small metastases involving the left centrum semiovale and the left occipital lobe.
Large mediastinal mass extending cranially through the thoracic inlet up to the level of the thyroid glands with thyroid invasion.
Cranial to this level, no lymphadenopathy is seen.
Stable anterior mediastinal mass and hilar adenopathy.
Decreased posterior mediastinal mass component on the left.
IMPRESSION:  Marked interval progression in size of all metastatic lesions since MRI of [**2171-10-23**].
The largest lesions demonstrate internal hemorrhage and surrounding vasogenic edema.
[**2171-11-7**]: MRI Head IMPRESSION:  New large hemorrhages with surrounding edema centered around the previously seen enhancing lesions.
There is minimal mass effect upon the right lateral ventricle, but there is no subfalcine herniation.
The above findings likely represent hemorrhage related to tumor necrosis following radiation therapy.
Extensive hemorrhage into abscesses is thought to be a much less likely possibility.
No significant interval change from MRI.
Hemorrhage and surrounding edema within multiple metastatic lesions, again likely related to post-radiation tumoral necrosis.
Mild mass effect on the right lateral ventricle but no evidence of herniation.
No evidence of significant interval change.
Multiple hyperdense foci with surrounding edema consistent with metastatic hemorrhagic parenchymal lesions.
Mild mass effect that is stable exerted on the right lateral ventricle.
[**2171-11-12**]: Non-contrast Head CT MPRESSION:  No significant change compared to prior study, with multiple hyperdense masses, with surrounding edema, consistent with metastatic lesions.
Relatively stable-appearing mass effect on the right lateral ventricle with mild leftward shift.
[**2171-11-12**]: Neck CT MPRESSION:  No significant change seen compared to prior study, with large mediastinal mass again identified.
No significant change compared to prior study, with large anterior mediastinal mass again identified, abutting the SVC, which appears slightly narrowed, however, appears to remain patent.
Innumerable pulmonary metastases again identified.
Hilar lymphadenopathy also again seen.
[**2171-11-13**]: Non-contrast head CT MPRESSION:  No significant change in multiple hyperdense lesions with surrounding edema most consistent with metastatic disease.
MODERATE GROWTH.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Respiratory failure:  Respiratory distress secondary to anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea.
He was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after a Y stent was placed and extubated and did well for 1 week; he was subsequently reintubated at [**Hospital1 2177**] due to increased secretions and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for tracheostomy.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for increasing respiratory secretions.
He was found to have a MRSA and Pseudomonas PNA.
He completed a course of treatment for MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia.
During the week prior to his death, patient was noted to have worsening right lower lobe infiltrates, likely representing a new pneumonia.
Germ cell tumor: Patient was found to have an anterior mediastinal mass consistent with a germ cell tumor.
s/p 3 cycles of etoposide & cisplatin ([**Date range (1) 24155**]).
He was found to have small brain metastases, but no metastases to the spine.
L Spine MRI showed no metastases in the spine.
Patient was noted to have increasing weakness on left side of body, with tingling feeling.
A CT scan done revealed edema and hemorrhage of known masses in the right parietal lobe.
It was felt that there would be no benefit in neurosurgical intervention.
Cause of renal failure is unclear.
Renal sono showed renal parenchemal disease, but no hydrophrosis.
# Anxiety and Depression: Significant anxiety per family.
Psychiatry followed along closely and assisted with management of his anxiety and insomnia.
# Tachycardia/HTN: Longstanding problem for patient.
This was thought to be due to underlying agitation, fevers, and illness.
# Anemia: Patient noted to have anemia, felt to be secondary to his chemotherapy and chronic disease.
# Thrombocytopenia: Patient developed thrombocytopenia after his chemotherapy, and was transfused frequently to keep his platelet count around 100, to avoid any further bleeding from his brain metastases.
Sadly, the patient's status continued to deteriorate, and he began to develop fevers, worsening respiratory, and mental status.
Discharge Disposition: Expired  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic Germ Cell Tumor.
