Admission Date:  [**2198-2-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2198-2-8**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Penicillins / Ambien  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13561**] Chief Complaint: Vision loss  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 88 year-old right-handed man with a history of reported coronary artery disease s/p CABG, dyslipidemia, and lymphoma, who presents as a transfer from [**Hospital3 **] after presentation with vision loss and falls.
The history is obtained from the patient, who has some difficulty relaying the details, and available documentation.
The patient also states that he had several falls at that time, which he also attributed to his visual loss.
He reports that he was assessed by his internist for these difficulties, and it was presumed that he had a "stroke."
Interestingly, he states this evening that he did not undergo imaging of his head at that time and no further evaluation or management was pursued.
He states that he has had the pain daily since that time, lasting for the majority of each day.
Though he has had occasional associated nocturnal awakening, he denies changes with position or Valsalva.
He states that he also has associated neck discomfort, but denies a history of trauma or manipulation.
Family was apparently concerned that he was confused and "usually sharper" than his current state.
There was no evidence of atrial fibrillation on EKG.
CXR showed no pneumonia.
A head CT, which I reviewed here, showed atrophy and a poorly defined low density region in the left parieto-occipital region, ~2 cm in diameter.
There was no hemorrhage.
Family History: Daughter with hypertension   Physical Exam: Vitals: T 98.1 F    BP 124/71   P 92    RR 18    SaO2 95 RA General: NAD, well nourished HEENT: NC/AT, sclerae anicteric, dry MM, no exudates in oropharynx Neck: neck has pain with minimal rotation worse toward the right, no bruits Lungs: clear to auscultation CV: regular rate and rhythm, no MMRG Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present Ext: arthritic digits, warm, no edema, pedal pulses appreciated Skin: left deltoid ecchymosis  Neurologic Examination: Mental Status: Somnolent but easily arousable, difficulty relaying coherent history, cooperative with exam Oriented to person, [**Location (un) 86**], [**2179-1-28**] Attention: cannot perform days of week backward without errors Language: fluent, perhaps mildly dysarthric speech, no paraphasic errors, naming, comprehension, repetition intact; [**Location (un) 1131**] intact (uses left eye only) Calculation: can determine 7 quarters in $1.75 Fund of knowledge: mentions recent election Memory: registration: [**1-30**] items, recall 0/3 items at 3 minutes No evidence of apraxia or neglect  Cranial Nerves: Uncorrected acuity 20/70 on the left, 20/200 on the right.
Pupils 1.5 mm and unreactive bilaterally.
His right eye does not adduct on leftward gaze, and appears a bit abducted and depressed in primary position.
Face moves symmetrically, though with left NLFF and flattening of left forehead creases.
Hearing reduced to conversation.
Tongue protrudes midline, no fasciculations.
Motor: Appears diffusely wasted, with fasciculations in legs and in left hand noted.
Perhaps mildly increased tone in legs.
No pronator drift.
Coordination: Unable to perform FNF accurately due to his diplopia and vision loss.
He was evaluated by ophthalmology who felt this was most consistent with a partial CN III palsy secondary to ischemia or inflammation.
Review of CT scan showed hypodensity in periaqueductal area, hypodensity in L temporal area c/w old infarct, and soft tissue mass around the foramen magnum.
Required MRI with anaesthesia to eval for ischemic process and to further evaluate soft tissue mass around foramen magnum.
There was some concern for lymphoma given h/o lymphoma to explain both soft tissue mass and possible infiltrating process.
MRI/MRA brain, orbit and neck with and without contrast showed: 1.
Enhancing soft tissue lesion at the skull base, surrounding the dens, with pre-contrast signal characteristics most consistent with fibrous tissue, including central focus of hypoenhancement.
This appearance might be seen with crystalline arthropathy such as CPPD arthropathy, with pannus secondary to an inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid or one of its variants (thought the pattern of dorsal involvement is atypical), or "pseudo- pannus" due to osteoarthritis.
Though there are erosive changes in the dens, pyogenic infection is considered less likely, as there is no visible fluid signal centrally; relatively "indolent" infection is an additional consideration.
Subacute infarction in the right midbrain, in the region of the periaqueductal white matter and median longitudinal fasciculus, likely explaining the recent symptoms.
Extensive small vessel ischemic disease, atrophy, and old left frontotemporal infarct with likely prior laminar necrosis and dystrophic mineralization.
Post anaesthesia, patient had quadriparesis and bilateral ptosis without any sensory findings.
Likely weakness was secondary to vecuronium slow to wear off.
Did monitor in ICU overnight, following NIF and VC, in case of myasthenia but in the end did not think that this was the cause of his weakness.
3rd cranial nerve palsy with limited adduction and upgaze of R eye and mild ptosis is likely fascicular.
MRI showing subacute infarct in R pariaquiductal area consistent with clinical course.
Also patient is a fall risk.
Further history indicated 1yr h/o cognitive decline.
As inpatient mild cognitive difficulties noted on MS exams.
Mental status  CV - Ruled out myocardial infarction and monitored on telemetry without events.
Urinanalysis and Utox negative.
Surface echocardiogram showed EF 25-30%, moderate MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], at least mild pulmonary artery hypertension.
Patient was noted to be in mild acute renal failure likely due to prerenal azotemia which improved slightly with mild IV resuscitation.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Ischemic partial cranial nerve III palsy soft tissue around foramen magnum  Secondary diagnosis: Coronary artery disease Status coronary artery bypass graft Coronary heart failure Dyslipidemia History of lymphoma Gout   Discharge Condition: Partial cranial nerve three palsy.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for double vision and falls.
It was also noted that you have a soft tissue mass around the base of your skull where the brainstem and spinal cord meet.
It is most likely fibrous tissue, but lymphoma cannot be ruled out.
Appropriate services should be arranged through your primary doctors as [**Name5 (PTitle) **] have declined our help with arranging services.
If you have any worsening or worrying symptoms, please call your PCP or come into the ED.
