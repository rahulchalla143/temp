Admission Date:  [**2138-5-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-6-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2069-11-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ciprofloxacin  Attending:[**Known firstname 3561**] Chief Complaint: Fever and Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line placement   History of Present Illness: 68 year old man with a past medical history significant for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, status post two cycles of R-CHOP, who originally presented to [**Hospital1 18**] from rehab with fever, chills, and malaise the day prior to admission.
He denied any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or recent fever, but endorses slight tenderness and redness over the PICC insertion site.
His PICC line was removed and sent for culture.
Due to concern for hypotension and sepsis, he was transferred to the ICU.
Blood cultures from admission grew [**4-2**] pansensitive staph aureus as well as [**2-2**] hafnia alvei which was sensitive to ceftriaxone, thus he was started on nafcillin and ceftriaxone.
Additionally, while in the ICU, he was found to have a DVT right basilic vein extending to axillary vein; for this he was started on heparin gtt with plan to transition to coumadin.
He has had persistent diarrhea while here, C. diff was sent and was negative x3.
Negative for chest pain, SOB  Past Medical History: 1.

Onc History: Pt initially presented to  [**Hospital3 46817**] in early [**Month (only) 547**] with cachexia, pour appetite, and right hydronephrosis secondary to a testicular mass and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
A biopsy showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and he received two cycles of Rituxan-CHOP on [**2138-4-18**] and [**2138-5-15**].
Family History: Brother with question of sudden cardiac death, second brother with diabetes and coronary artery disease who died at age 57, third brother with history of cerebrovascular accident.
HEENT: Anicteric sclera.
No oropharyngeal lesions.
Slightly dry mucous membranes.
No cervical lymphadenopathy.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.
Nontender throughout.
No  rebound or guarding.
2+ radial pulses.
No peripheral edema appreciated.
There is no focal consolidation.
There is no significant amount of pleural fluid.
There is no pneumothorax .
R upper ext u/s [**2138-6-1**]: Occlusive thrombus in the right basilic vein extending into the axillary vein.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-2-27**], there is no significant change.
TEE [**2138-6-4**]: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
No mobile elements are seen attached to the catheter.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
An eccentric jet of probable mild aortic regurgitation is seen; however, given the eccentric nature of this flow, cannot exclude the possibility of a small aortic leaflet perforation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild to moderate ([**12-31**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Left upper ext u/s [**2138-6-5**]: No evidence of DVT in the left upper extremity.
Urine cx [**2138-5-30**]: MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT WITH SKIN AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION.
[**2138-5-31**], blood cultures: 1/4 bottles with Staph Aureus (sensitivies same as blood cx from [**2138-5-30**]) .
Stool: negative for Cdiff x 3, negative for O&P, stool culture negative  Brief Hospital Course: 68 year old man with diffuse B cell lymphoma status post two cycles of R-CHOP who presented with fever and hypotension in the setting of infected PICC line.
He also was noted to have an upper extremity DVT associated with the line.
His PICC line was removed; blood cultures and PICC catheter tip grew MSSA and Hafnia Alvei.
R upper extremitiy u/s revealed a DVT of the right basilic vein extending into the axillary vein (this is where the old PICC had been).
Trans-thoracic and trans-esophageal echos were done; neither revealed a vegetation but the TEE showed an eccentric jet of aortic regurgitaion which could not be ruled out as a manifestation of endocarditis.
The Ceftriaxone should be given for a 2-week course (Hafnia Alvei is not a common cause of endocarditis), and Nafcillin should be given for 6 weeks (as MSSA commonly causes endocarditis).
2) RUE DVT: At site of former PICC, U/S showed occlusive thrombus in the right basilic vein extending into the axillary vein.
Heparin was d/c'd and no further anticoaggulation started for the following reasons: The DVT was associated with a line that was removed, and the patient has a h/o subdural & subarachnoid hemorrhage 3 months ago.
3) Diarrhea: The patient had recent C. diff infection for which he was on PO vanco.
He continued to have loose stools.
PO vanco - f/u C. diff toxin B .
Due to the infection and possible endocarditis, his CHOP chemotherapy will be held, but he was given 1 dose of Rituximab while inpatient.
6) Hyponatremia:  During previous hospitalization, patient was noted to have low sodium level, thought to be secondary to SIADH.
8) Prophylaxis:  Was given heparin gtt for DVT as above, then ambulating.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Loperamide 2 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for diarrhea.
Sepsis secondary to infected PICC line and bacteremia 2.
Right upper extremitiy DVT related to old PICC line 2.
Call your doctor if you have fever, chills or any other symptom that concerns you.
