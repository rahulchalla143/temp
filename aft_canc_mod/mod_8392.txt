There is no pneumothorax, focal consolidation, or pleural effusion.
[**6-17**] EEG FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: The background consists of a low voltage, disorganized, delta frequency rhythm seen throughout the recording without any clear state changes.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of a low  voltage, disorganized, slow background, mostly in the delta frequency range without state changes.
These findings suggest the presence of a severe diffuse encephalopathy which indicates widespread cerebral dysfunction but is non-specific as to etiology.
There were no focal or epileptiform features seen.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Discoid atelectasis in the right lower lobe.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Calcific atherosclerosis of the aortic arch and branch vessels.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation.
Multiple prominent celiac and periportal nodes, measuring up to 8-11 mm in short axis.
Kidneys are atrophic, without stones or hydronephrosis.
Note is made of a circumaortic left renal vein.
There is a small fat-containing umbilical hernia.
There is oral contrast in the ascending colon and hepatic flexure.
Bladder is partially collapsed, with apparent mild circumferential wall thickening.
Diffuse calcifications throughout the abdominal aorta, with involvement of branch vessel ostia.
No free intraperitoneal fluid or air.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
Degenerative lumbar spine changes with endplate sclerosis and subchondral cysts.
Slight compression deformity of L3 with Schmorl node and irregularity of the superior endplate.
Moderate diffuse disc bulge at L3-L4.
Grade 1 anterolisthesis at L4-L5, with broad-based posterior disc bulge.
Mild diffuse disc bulge at L5-S1.
Multilevel moderate facet hypertrophy and ligamentum flavum thickening, resulting in mild-to-moderate canal and foraminal stenoses.
No source for infection identified on this non-contrast CT exam.
Renal atrophy.
Brief Hospital Course: 62-year-old male with intractable cancer pain secondary to hepatocellular carcinoma, anasarca related to cirrhosis, ESRD on hemodialysis, diabetes with nephropathy, retinopathy, peripheral vascular disease, and neuropathy who presents with altered mental status and hypotension, likely multifactorial from med effect and UTI.
He did well but later began to have fevers to 102.
The catheter tip culture did not grow anything and multiple rounds of blood cultures were negative.
Despite the investigations no clear cause of his fevers or tachycardia were found and persisted intermittently throughout this admission.
His fevers and tachycardia are believed to be from his HCC.
# Altered mental status: He has hepatic encephalopathy at baseline but his mental status was depressed beyond his baseline.
An EEG was performed which did not show any seizures and was most consistent with toxic metabolic etiology.
She was informed of his intermittent fever and increasing encephalopathy, and also of the deferral of lumbar puncture, with which she agreed.
# ESRD on HD: tunneled HD line replaced as above.
# Hypertension, benign: He was on amlodipine, carvedilol, lasix, metolazone at home but because of his low blood pressures these were held and not restarted.
If his mental status does not improve he would likely benefit from withdrawing uncomfortable and largely ineffective therapies.
[**Month (only) 116**] use dilaudid as this is less likely to build up in patients with renal disease.
#Current Status: Pt is currently tachycardic with intermittent fevers and altered mental status.
