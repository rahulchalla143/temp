Admission Date:  [**2130-2-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-3-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-10-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: OSH transfer for plasma pharesis evaluation   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Knee washout, intubation  History of Present Illness: 62-year-old male with history of multiple myeloma/plasma cell dyscrasia, type I cryoglobulinemia, chronic renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure, anemia and COPD presents from OSH with staphylcoccus aureus bacteremia, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, lower extremity edema for evaluation of plasma pharesis.
Per OSH records, the patient was in his usual state of health until recently when he received velcade and ecadron on [**1-30**] and again on [**2-6**] and was admitted for concern of tumor lysis syndrome.
However, at home he continued be be very weak and developed progressive lower extremity edema.
On admission, he was afebrile, denied dysuria, polyuria, shortness of breath, cough, or other symptoms other than chronic pain and fatigue.
Nephrology was consulted and thought that the patient had bilateral edema from acute on chronic renal failure, likely secondary to cryoglobulinemia.
Over the next two days he had improvement of BUN to 76, creatinine to 2.33 (eventual nadir 2.17) and worsening of thrombocytopenia (to 27).
He developed hallucinations and had a head CT that was negative.
He developed a bandemia of 15.
He was pan cultured and diagnosed with a urinary tract infection.
CXR without evidence of acute infection.
He continue to have altered mental status and deveoped hypotension to 99/63, fevers to 101F and rising WBC.
Blood cultures revealed 4/4 bottles with staphylcoccus aureus (sensitivities pending) and he was started on vancomycin.
He was noted to have hypoalbuminemia and relative hypotension.
Per signout, although no mention in notes, nephrologist states that he need dialysis.
The reason for transfer is for evaluation for plasma pharesis.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he was intermittently responsive to questions, reports all-over body pain and otherwise difficult to ascertain as patient not very responsive other than moaning to movement.
He was intubated essentially on arrival for CXR showing ARDS and poor O2 saturation on 6L NC and facemask.
His art stick showed acidemia and a lactate that increased from 2.6 to 8.2. .

MODERATE GROWTH.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Moderately large right acute pneumothorax with associated mediastinal shift to left and collapse of the right upper lobe.
Multifocal predominantly upper lobe severe consolidation, in light of recent chemotherapy, fungal and viral infections are considered possible, although the pattern could also be described in bacterial pneumonia.
Adult respiratory distress syndrome is also considered possible, but the lack of a gravitational gradient makes this less likely.
Bilateral moderately large pleural effusions.
Mild pulmonary edema.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2130-2-21**] at 11:23:41 AM      FINAL  Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with inferior and septal akinesis/severe hypokinesis with mild to moderate hypokinesis elsewhere.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a moderate-sized vegetation on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve (1.4 cm x 1 cm).
An eccentric, laterally directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
US left thigh [**2130-3-6**] Fluid collection in the left lateral thigh with overlying inflammatory change.
An infected collection is a concern with the history.
2.8 cm rim enhancing fluid collection, suspicious for abscess, in the right posterior paraspinal soft tissues adjacent to the right C4-5 facet.
Abnormal marrow signal adjacent to the joint may represent osteomyelitis or marrow edema.
Increased STIR signal within the C5-6 disc with adjacent epidural enhancing material suspicious for osteomyelitis, discitis with associated epidural phlegmon.
This process combines with underlying degenerative changes to cause moderate spinal canal narrowing at this level.
Numerous rim-enhancing fluid collections involving the left shoulder, partially evaluated, suspicious for abscesses.
Given history of recent septicemia, findings highly suspicious for infectious osteomyelitis of the bilateral L3-4 facet joints with adjacent abscesses in the posterior paraspinal soft tissues.
At L3-L4, there is a posterior epidural component, which bows the cauda equina anteriorly, but does not cause high-grade spinal canal narrowing.
Similar collections in the posterior paraspinal soft tissues at L4-5 and L5-S1 are also suspicious for abscesses, but with preserved marrow signal adjacent to these more inferior facet joints making osseous involvement less likely.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is suggested.
There is no pericardial effusion.
A TEE would better assess the severity of MR and the mitral vegetation.
Two foci of acute infarction in the right anterior centrum semiovale and right posterior occipital lobe.
Bilateral mastoid opacification.
Please correlate clinically for evidence of mastoiditis.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 62 year old male with history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, plasma cell dysplasia with Kappa light chains and cryoglobulinemia treated in [**2127**], now s/p relapse and retreatment [**2130-2-6**] with resultant tumor lysis syndrome, acute on chronic kidney failure, and hospitalization at [**Hospital 22913**] from [**2130-2-10**] to [**2130-2-19**] complicated by development of MSSA septicemia, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
He was intubated soon after arrival, and found to have a septic right knee joint, multiple paraspinal abcesses, mitral valve endocarditis, and septic shock.
# Goals of care: given overwhelming sepsis and multiple sources of infection, goals of care discussion was held with his health care proxy and his care was transitioned to comfort measures only.
Pain was managed with methadone IV standing and hydromorphone IV bolus as needed.
# Septic Shock: Secondary to MSSA bacteremia.
On admission the patient was hypotensive requiring 3 pressors and epinephrine injection for support.
He developed mitral valve endocarditis and septic arthritis (addressed below).
# Endocarditis: He had stigmata of endocarditis with [**Last Name (un) 1003**] lesions on his left hand, and bilateral feet.
# Septic Arthritis: He had a septic right knee with purulent aspiration with serial bedside washes and OR washout on [**2130-2-23**] with arthrotomy with debridement, lavage, and synovectomy, as well as irrigation and debridement of his left elbow bursa.
# Paraspinal fluid collections: MRI of the spine showed multiple fluid collections likely representing abcesses in the Cervical and thoracic spine.
# Left thigh fluid collection: A 30cm x 10cm area of erythemia was noted over the lateral aspect of his left thigh.
Ultrasound was consistent with fluid collection, likely representing an abcess.
# Mental status: patient had depressed consciousness following extubation.
Concern for septic emboli was raised and he was sent for MRI brain which showed acute infarcts in right anterior centrum semiovale and right posterior occipital lobe but no evidence of abcess.
Throughout the remainder of his ICU course, he remained confused though responsive to simple commands, oriented to person, hospital, year:[**2117**].
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient was intubated shortly after arrival.
Chest CT on [**2130-2-20**] showed upper lobe consolidation and his sputum grew MSSA, for which he was continued on Nafcillin.
He was also found to have a right pneumothorax on CT and a chest tube was placed by IP.
Chest tube remained in place due to persistent bronchopleural fistula.
# Anemia: The patient was noted to have a dropping hematocrit in the setting of coffee ground particles from his NG lavage, and blood in his oropharynx likely [**1-4**] trauma from multiple NGT placements.
ENT was consulted and saw no evidence of active epistaxis.
GI was consulted who noted stable HCT and recommended against EGD and continued medical management with pantoprazole.
# Renal Failure: acute on chronic renal failure.
He has Stage III CKD and recent tumor lysis syndrome from Velcade chemotherapy.
He likely developed some degree of ATN given his hypotension, which gradually resolved.
Total IgG elevated (marginally).
No cryoglobulin was detected when checked on [**2130-2-20**] and his serum viscosity was just below the normal range.
# Pain control: He has been having generalized body pain, likely due to septic arthritis and endocarditis, possibly with some contribution from his MM and chronic pain.
