History of Present Illness: The patient is a 58-year-old Chinese male with a history of HBV infection who developed abdominal pain and an ultrasound that demonstrated a 10.5-cm mass in the right lobe of the liver.
The chest CT demonstrated no evidence of pulmonary metastases.
The abdominal CT demonstrated a mass in segment A of the liver that extends inferiorly into segment B measuring 10.6 x 9.3 cm.
The mass appears to compress and possibly invade the medial segment of the left lobe with the mass being abutting the middle hepatic vein.
There are satellite nodules in the right lobe that measured 12 mm in diameter and lie close to the surface.
He does appear to have cirrhosis based on the nodularity of the liver.
He had no evidence of portal hypertension.
Worked as a chef in Chinese restraurant, but unable to work due to pain/nausea from liver mass.
Family History: Father colon ca Brother died 60 unknown cancer  Physical Exam: Pre operative T 97.4 HR 94  Bp 125/84 Wght 50.2 KG On physical exam he is an alert male in no acute distress.
HEENT:  No scleral icterus.
No tenderness or abdominal distention.
Pertinent Results: [**1-23**] Ct scan: Huge multilobulated right lobe hepatic mass as described, status post right portal vein embolization.
Small similar-appearing segment III nodule was wedge resected after ultrasound localization  [**2178-1-24**] Ct scan: 1.
No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.
Moderate-sized right pleural effusion.
Bilateral moderate-to-large pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis, right greater than left.
Status post liver resection for HCC with low density fluid in the surgical bed and percutaneous drain in place.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = [**10-21**] %).
with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
[**1-29**] CXR 10 am: interval increase in right pleural effusion and potential left pleural effusion with subsequent worsening of the right lung aeration  [**1-29**] CXR: Improved aeration in right middle and right lower lobe following reduction in size of pleural effusion.
Post-operative changes in the abdomen are again demonstrated as well as slight worsening of gastric distention.
[**1-29**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Relatively rapidly reoccurring of pleural effusion during last one hour examination interval.
No pneumothorax has developed.
Findings explained by bilateral pleural effusions rather than pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: [**1-23**] PT admitted post operatively to the transplant service s/p uncomplicated  Right trisegmentectomy, CCY, excision of segment III nodule with EBL of 700 CC.
Post op patient's pain was controlled with PCA.
Patient was tachycardic in the PACU and transfused 2 units PRBC.
[**1-24**] Lfts stable, post operative ultrasound without evidence of biliary dilatations .
Dilaudid for pain control.
CTA to ro PE showed no evidence of clot, but large right pleural effusion.
Abdominal CT showed ascites but no discrete fluid collections.
Pain in RUQ requiring  Dilaudid prn.
Patient remained persistently tachycardic 120s with metoprolol and pain control but continued to have oxygen saturations 96% on 4 L. [**1-29**] Morning pt became increasingly tachycardic to 150s-170s  w/o difficulty breathing with decreased oxygen sats to the 80s on 6L.
During the procedure patient became hypotensive to 78 systolic.
Despite IVF boluses he continued to be hypotensive .
Neo added, all pressors maximal  with bradycardia to 50s then went PEA.
Pt also had massive pulmonary edema with roughly 500 cc of serous fluid continuously being suctioned from ETT.
Pt became asystolic at 16.25 and patient was pronounced dead.
