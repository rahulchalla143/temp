Admission Date:  [**2153-2-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-2-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2086-3-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Flagyl / Iodine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**] Chief Complaint: Acute Blood Loss Anemia due to Gastric Ulcers with Bleeding  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Upper Endoscopy   History of Present Illness: 66 year old Female with ESRD on peritoneal dialysis due to hypertensive nephropathy, and h/o NSCLC on Tarceva and nephrolithiasis who presents with symptomatic anemia.
The patient typically adjusts her weekly EPO injections between 4000-6000 units depending on her symptoms of fatigue and dyspnea.
Two and a half weeks ago her dialysis nurse had her terminate EPO in the setting of an elevated hmg > 12 per her report.
She titrates her own EPO, given a similar episode of severe symptomatic anemia.
In the interim she developed excruciating flank pain earlier this week for which she presented to the ED, a CT demonstrated bilateral stones.
However, as the week progressed, she has become progressively constipated and fatigued with suprapubic abdominal pain.
She reports her PD fluid has been clear.
She had an episodic visit at [**Company 191**] on Thursday which prompted referral to the ED.
Blood cultures were taken, but patient denied any fevers or chills.
A CXR was negative for acute processes.
On transfer to the floor her abdominal pain had completely resolved in the setting of a large dark brown bowel movement after receiving kayexalate.
She notes acid reflux for the past 3 days that has been constant.
Past Medical History: MEDICAL & SURGICAL HISTORY: - NSCLC on erlotinib - ESRD on PD - recurrent nephrolithiasis - depression - insomnia - seasonal rhinitis - papillary thyroid CA s/p excision  Social History: Divorced, lives in same house as 3 friends ([**Name (NI) 11894**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], [**Name (NI) **]).
2 adult sons.
Family History: Mother- diabetes Father with kidney disease   Physical Exam: ADMISSION: VS: 98.7 143/69 85 18 100 RA GENERAL - in NAD, comfortable, appropriate, pale HEENT - NC/AT, MMM LUNGS - CTAB, no r/rh/wh, good air movement, resp unlabored HEART - RR, no MRG, nl S1-S2 ABDOMEN - soft/NT/slightly distended, no rebound/guarding, PD catheter in lower abdomen with clean bandage, skin without erythema, non-tender EXTREMITIES - trace LE edema, WWP, 1+ peripheral pulses NEURO - awake, A&Ox3, gait intact  DISCHARGE: GENERAL: NAD, comfortable, upright in pain, returned color LUNGS: Decreased breath sounds and mild crackles at left lower lung base HEART - RR, no MRG, nl S1-S2 ABDOMEN - soft/NT/slightly distended, no rebound/guarding, PD catheter in lower abdomen with clean bandage, skin without erythema, non-tender EXTREMITIES - trace LE edema, WWP, 1+ peripheral pulses  Pertinent Results: CHEST XRAY [**2153-2-15**] PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.
Left lower lobe mass is again noted, better seen on the prior CT, but similar compared to the prior study.
Nodular opacity within the left upper lobe appears relatively unchanged from prior.
Small left pleural effusion persists.
No pneumothorax is identified.
Left proximal humeral fracture appears chronic.
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change in appearance of left lower lobe lung mass, and nodule in the left upper lobe.
Persistent small left pleural effusion.
CT ABDOMEN w/out contrast [**2153-2-15**] CT OF THE ABDOMEN: There is unchanged left lower lobe round nodule with associated surgical material and small left pleural effusion and mild bibasilar atelectasis.
Unchanged multiple pulmonary nodules at the right lung base.
Adjacent sub-cm hypodensity in the left lobe is also unchanged.
A peritoneal dialysis (PD) cathether is visualized in the left lower quadrant with unchanged small 17 x 8 mm seroma in the subcutaneous soft tissues and moderate amount of ascites.
There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy, no pelvic hernias.
BONES: There are moderate degenerative change at L5-S1 with intervertebral disc disease.
IMPRESSION: No acute process or interval change from 2 days prior, including no evidence of diverticulitis or appendicitis.
PORTABLE CHEST XRAY [**2153-2-18**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-15**]: Mild interstitial abnormality in the right lung is probably edema.
Moderate left pleural effusion is increasing.
Large left lung lesions also appear grown since [**2-15**], though this is probably mostly a function of projection between the PA and AP orientations.
Mediastinal veins and upper lobe pulmonary vessels are slightly dilated.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2153-2-19**]):    NO GROWTH.
EGD: [**2153-2-16**] Impression:	Multiple superficial ulcers in the stomach antrum Few cratered ulcers in the pre-pyloric region A single cratered ulcer with stigmata of recent bleeding in the pre-pyloric region (injection) Bulbar duodenitis Brunner's gland hyperplasia in the duodenal bulb Scalloping folds on the mucosa of the second and third parts of the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations:	The findings account for the symptoms, and the distribution of the gastric ulcers suggests that they are NSAID-induced.
Continue PPI, avoid all aspirin or NSAID products.
Consider DDAVP and/or platelet transfusion for uremic platelets.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE Ms. [**Known lastname 92380**] is a 66 year old woman with ESRD on PD, NSCLC, anemia, and thyroid cancer who presented with an upper GI bleed.
She required multiple transfusions and transfer to the MICU where upper endoscopy revealed bleeding gastric ulcers secondary to recent NSAID use.
ACTIVE ISSUES # Acute Blood Loss Anemia due to Gastric Ulcers with Bleeding, Duodenitis: Symptomatic anemia in the setting of a significant drop in Hct over a three day period.
(36->27->22) Etiology initially concerning for discontinuation of weekly epogen in setting of elevated hmg on routine lab draw.
The patient has past history of dramatic hct drop off epo.
Initially no evidence of acute bleed, guaic negative stool in the ED prior to transfer, however on the morning of admission the patient passed four melanolic stool, guaic positive.
EGD revealed multiple gastric ulcers in antrum, one of which had stigmata of recent bleed with overlying dark area.
There was no evidence of active bleeding.
The duodenal bulb was acutely inflammed and edematous w/o discrete ulcer or bleeding.
She will discuss further epoitin dosing with her outpatient nephrologist.
# Flank Pain: The patient has was admitted to the ED prior to admission for left sided plank pain for which she was prescribed vicodin for pain managment.
An episode of this flank pain recurred on admission.
Physical exam demonstrated left flank tenderness to palpation.
CT abdomen on [**2-13**] demonstrated bilateral stones and CT abdomen two days later demonstrated calcified atrophic kidneys.
Unclear if pain is secondary to stones as patient is PD dependant and almost anuric.
Her pain was treated with vicodin.
# Abdominal Pain Diffuse: Completely resolved in setting of large bowel movement on night of admission.
She was afebrile, but given her history of peritonitis and PD, fluid sent for culture and gram stain.
The patient became mildly fluid overloaded in setting of multiple transfusions and clear diet.
CXR demonstrated small pleural effusion.
# Hyperkalemia: Hyperkalemic on admission.
)(s)* Refills:*2* 10. hydrocodone-acetaminophen 5-500 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain for 3 days.
Disp:*qS Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* 11. hydroxyzine HCl 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every six (6) hours as needed for itching.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for management of an upper GI bleed.
An upper endoscopy demonstrated multiple ulcers in your stomach.
A small injection of epinephrine in one of the bleeding ulcers was made which stopped the bleeding.
You developed left sided flank pain that appears to be an intermittant chronic issue.
