Myocardial ischemia.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old male with a history of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia who presents with complaints of weakness.
The patient state he has had a progressive fatigue which developed over the past three to four weeks.
He also stated he has had dark urine for the past two weeks.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   On review of systems, he denied headache but did report some night sweats.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   In the Emergency Room, generally a male resting on stretcher, appeared tired but in no apparent distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
No third heart sound, or fourth heart sound, or murmurs.
The abdomen was soft and distended with normal active bowel sounds.
A palpable spleen tip, and no palpable liver.
Extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Urinalysis revealed less than 1.005 for specific gravity, 100 of protein, glucose of greater than 1000, 0 to 2 red blood cells, 0 to 2 white blood cells, occasional bacteria, and large blood.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia.
He had a rate of 120 with intervals of 148, 86, and 43 with flattened T waves inferiorly, and no ST changes.
Chest x-ray revealed no infiltrate.
for suspected autoimmune hemolytic anemia crisis and the process of obtaining typed and crossed matched blood began.
An arterial blood gas at that time revealed a pH of 7.37, a PCO2 of 25, and PO2 of 106, and a mild lactic acidosis with a lactate level of 2.5.
Serial hematocrits were followed; however, the patient did not develop an increase in his hematocrit.
At approximately 8 o'clock in the morning, the patient became acutely dyspneic with shortness of breath and a decreased oxygen saturation.
A house officer responded to find the patient short of breath and uncomfortable.
His blood pressure fell, and there was no palpable pulse.
Throughout the remainder of that day, the patient's source of lactic acidosis was aggressively sought.
Quickly thereafter, his blood pressure and pulse fell again, and the patient suffered another pulseless electrical activity arrest.
He briefly developed ventricular fibrillation.
Potassium was markedly elevated as well.
He experienced cardiac arrest again at approximately 4 p.m., and no measures were taken.
