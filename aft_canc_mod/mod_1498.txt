The procedure was quick and noninvasive with a superficial incision and minimal blood loss under general anesthesia.
Tonight, on the floor, she had the acute onset of dypsnea and tachypnea, with a sudden desaturation to the 70's and tachycardia to the 110's.

She finds her left leg and the immobilization brace to be extremely uncomfortable.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: Metastatic breast cancer: - [**2106**]: diagnosed at stage IV with mets to lymph nodes and liver; initially treated with doxorubicin, a bone marrow transplant, and a partial mastectomy - [**2108**]: had recurrence with multiple liver lesions seen in her liver; treated with trastuzumab and paclitaxel - remained in remission on trastuzumab and paclitaxel for 5 years, until [**2113**] when she had mets to her left hip and underwent a partial hip replacement - [**2114**]: noted to have brain mets, and she underwent surgical resection and Cyberknife therapy - [**2116**]: noted to have cancer in her femur and underwent more surgery; received additional therapy (which she could not recall) in the meantime, and she has continued to be on trastuzumab - [**5-/2118**]: underwent XRT for metastatic disease in her spine - [**1-/2119**]: had L2 progressive metastases, underwent surgery and then gamma knife radiation treatment in [**4-/2119**]; developed thrombocytopenia after radiation - combination of lapatinib and trastuzumab were tried, but patient developed significant diarrhea as well as pneumonia; lapatinib was discontinued - [**5-/2119**]: started zolendronate again - [**2119-6-2**]: re-staging showed no new systemic metastases; she has old cerebellar met, which had been radiated.
- continued on fulvestrant every month and trastuzumab every three weeks; zolendronate being held due to recent tooth pull [**2-9**] Revision PSF T9-L4 related to increased pain.
--[**3-12**] PET scan showed two foci in the left lateral thigh.
right acetabulum unchanged.
Other Past Medical History: - HTN - Dyslipidemia - GERD - RLS - Depression - Insomnia - Chronic pain - Hypercoagulability/SVC thrombus: possible borderline protein C/S deficiency; on enoxaparin - Hypogammaglobulinemia: previous reaction to IVIG, now on Doxy ppx since [**2-9**]   Social History: She is married.
Family History: Her daughter had breast cancer at 29, and had a recurrence.
LLE: Her exam reveals a closed fracture of the patella with some effusion as expected and no abrasion or skin bridge.
No palpable defect.
Vitals: 103.5 103 133/76 93% on 50% FM General: Alert, oriented, uncomfortable HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL and 8mm bilaterally Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: Tachycardic, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: Rhonchi and crackles mid way up on the left side with crackles and the right base Abdomen: +BS, soft, non-tender, non-distended, no organomegaly, multiple bruises from lovenox injections GU: foley draining clear yellow urine Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema, no calf pain, left leg with [**Doctor Last Name **] locked in extention Neuro: CNII-XII intact, 5/5 strength upper/lower extremities, grossly normal sensation .
[**12-12**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Bibasilar pneumonia .
[**12-13**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
A right-to-left shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The entrance of the inferior vena cava into the right atrium is narrowed with extrinsic compression and possibly intraluminal mass/thrombus as well.
The right ventricle is similarly dilated, with at least moderate pulmonary hypertension.
The findings suggest acute-on-chronic right ventricular afterload excess consistent with venous thromboembolic phenomena, pulmonary lymphangitic spread of breast cancer, pulmonary parenchymal disease, .
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic injury.
Bibasilar ground-glass opacification concerning for aspiration versus pneumonia.
3-mm calcified nodule in the right upper lung (2, 13), stable compared to the prior PET-CT of [**2120-9-20**].
Large hiatal hernia.
A 12-mm right hilar lymph node (series 3, 24) is noted.
[**12-13**] bilateral lower extremity dopplers: no DVT .
DISCHARGE LABS:   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Orthopedic service on [**2120-12-12**] for a left transverse patella fracture after being evaluated in the Orthopedic Trauma Clinic.
She underwent open reduction internal fixation of the fracture without complication on [**2120-12-11**].
She had adequate pain management and worked with physical therapy while in the hospital.
On [**2120-12-13**], the patient had an acute episode of hypoxia and tachypnea on the floor.
A CXR was concerning for bibasilar pneumonia versus pulmonary edema.
We were concerned about possible acute on chronic pulmonary emboli, so a CTA was performed that was negative for PE.
The CT, however, did find bibasliar opacities, concerning for lymphangetic spread of her known breast cancer, pneumonia/aspiration, or edema.
It was thought that her hypoxia and hypotensive episode was most concerning for an aspiration event.
Possibly secondary to stress reaction from pneumonia infection.
She was continued on her lovenox for known SVC clot and new immobility.
# Metastatic breast cancer: Currently on herceptin as an outpatient, with plans to restart irinotecan.
Continued pain management.
# Depression: continued sertraline and buproprion # GERD: continued pantoprazole and ranitidine # HTN: continued valsartan # Med rec: continued pramipexole, vitamin D .
