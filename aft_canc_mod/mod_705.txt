HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of abdominal pain and distention who underwent an EGD evaluation which revealed an adenocarcinoma of the distal stomach.
The patient underwent, on [**2129-1-14**], a partial gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y jejunogastrostomy, for adenocarcinoma of the stomach.
This operation was complicated by abdominal distention with CT finding of free air, although no evidence of leakage of contrast per CT. Because of the septic state of the patient, the patient was re-explored resulting in oversewing of gastrojej anastomosis and drainage of pancreatic ascites.
On [**2129-1-27**], the patient became uncooperative and removed the feeding jejunostomy voluntarily.
Secondarily, attempts to reinsert the J tube revealed a small bowel perforation which required reopening laparotomy, repair of small bowel, and reinsertion of the feeding jejunostomy.
dressing changes along the open abdominal wound site.
The patient requires abdominal binders and monitoring for adequate nutritional intake.
