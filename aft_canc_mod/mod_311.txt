- Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild anterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse.
An eccentric, inferolaterally directed jet of mild-moderate ([**12-30**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

PATH [**2131-11-6**]: 1.7cm colonic adenocarcinoma T1N1aMx; [**1-9**] lymph nodes positive  Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo Spanish speaking M w/ colon adenocarcinoma (dx in [**8-7**]), DM, CAD s/p stent LAD/first diag ([**2123**]), SVT s/p ablation, HTN, DLP, CRI (Cr 1.4) s/p left colectomy with component separation/ventral hernia repair, drainage of abcess related to old abdominal mesh.
Immediate postoperative course c/b hypertension, tachycardia, and hypoxia transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further care.
Neuro: Pre-operatively, an epidural was placed for pain control.
Post-operatively, the patient continued with epidural anesthesia with good effect and adequate pain control.
Per recommendations from geriatrics, narcotic pain medications were discontinued on POD9 secondary to increased risk delirium in geriatric population.
CV: The patient was initially hypertensive postoperatively but then became hypotensive likely secondary to CHF.
Cardiac enzymes were drawn times three to rule out myocardial infarction and they were negative.
A cardiology consult was sought on POD3, there assessment was that underlying mitral regurgitation, continued hypertension, and overall positive fluid balance since surgery were contributing to his CHF picture.
Patient was found to be intermittently in atrial fibrillation and recommendations per cardiology were followed-beta blocker, amlodipine were titrated to appropriate heart rate and blood pressure.
Patient's fluid balance was carefully monitored and he intermittently received lasix vs fluid to achieve euvolemia such that he was adequately supported from a cardiovascular standpoint without fluid overload compromising his pulmonary status.
Patient also was transfused packed RBCs when appropriate to maintain adequate volume status without fluid overload.
As patient was diuresed oxygen requirement diminished and patient was transferred to floor on POD6 on supplemental oxygen via nasal canula and intermittent nebulizer treatments for shortness of breath/wheezing.
He was found to have elevated creatinine postoperatively consistent with ATN per his FeNa.
Patient's ACE inhibitor was held during admission secondary to increased creatinine.
On POD4, patient was found to be positive for C diff and started on po vancomycin and IV flagyl.
The patient's temperature was closely watched for signs of infection.
Pathology showed T1N1aMx colonic adenocarcinoma.
At the time of discharge on POD#14, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating with assistance, with a foley in place, and pain was well controlled.
