Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include hypokinesis of apex and apical segments.

Electronically signed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3318**], MD, Interpreting physician  FINAL REPORT   INDICATION: 70-year-old man with three-vessel disease.
Evaluate right upper quadrant given elevated LFTs.
COMPLETE ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: The liver is normal in echotexture with no focal abnormalities demonstrated.
There is no evidence of gallbladder wall thickening or edema.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or stones.
Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis.
No focal liver lesions.
3-cm abdominal aortic aneurysm just above the bifurcation.
FINDINGS: Relative to the most recent prior study, there is marked interval aeration of both lungs.
There is a left pleural effusion with adjacent relaxation atelectasis.
Minimal fluid tracks within the major fissure.
No focal consolidation is identified.
There is a tortuous atherosclerotic [**Month/Day/Year 5236**].
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Small left pleural effusion.
Given recent myocardial infarction and severe three vessel disease, intravenous Heparin was initiated.
Routine chest x-ray was notable for a tortuous and calcified [**Known lastname 5236**] for which a chest CT scan was obtained.
There was calcification at the left side of the arch and the posterior proximal arch was only slightly dilated.
There was no evidence of dissection.
The CT scan also revealed a 3.1 cm spiculated mass in the right middle lobe, concerning for lung carcinoma.
Head MR imaging found no evidence of metastatic disease.
Spirometry showed normal lung volumes and PET imaging revealed focal abnormal uptake of FDG in a right middle lobe mass with a maximal SUV measured at 8.3.
There was no FDG-avid or enlarged mediastinal or hilar nodes.
Further preoperative workup included abdominal ultrasound for elevated LFT's.
Ultrasound was notable for multiple small mobile gallstones.
There was no evidence of gallbladder wall thickening or edema and the common duct was not distended.
The pancreatic head and body were unremarkable and there were no focal liver lesions.
Right middle lobe mass also evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of thoracic surgery and he will need lobectomy in [**7-14**] weeks after CABG.
Beta blockade started and transferred to the floor to on POD #2 to begin increasing his activity level.ACE inhibitor also titrated.Short bursts of AFib treated with amiodarone on POD #4 and pacing wires removed.
