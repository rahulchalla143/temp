CT Head: No CT evidence for acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Markedly dilated, but patent portal vein with biphhasic, helical flow.
Patent paraumbilical vein and varices due to portal hypertension.
Gallstone, but no acute cholecystitis.
4.6 x 4.3 cm anechoic cystic lesion at the porta hepatis, likely represents a liver cyst off the caudate lobe.
Early subacute infarcts in bilateral frontal, parietal, right posterior temporal and occipital lobes, right thalamus and right superior cerebellar vermis.
Generalized cerebral atrophy with extensive changes of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
The right temporalis muscle is slightly enlarged in size and appears hyperintense on FLAIR images, this may represent edema or myositis.
EEG [**2141-10-24**]: IMPRESSION: This EEG continues to show an exceptionally active paroxysmal epileptiform abnormality in the right occipital pole in the context of a continuous focal delta disturbance suggestive of a large structural lesion in that region.
There are superimposed fairly frequent electrographic seizures that are now spreading to the left homolygous hemipsheric regions but with no obvious clinical accompaniment.
EEG [**2141-10-25**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU video EEG study due to paroxysmal at times periodic epileptiform discharges in the right occipital pole in the context of a continuous focal delta activity suggestive of a large structural lesion in that region.
There are superimposed intermittent electrographic seizures that occasionally spread to the left homologous hemispheric regions but with no obvious clinical accompaniment.
Background was asymmetric with delta slowing and suppression on the right and [**6-27**] Hz posterior dominant rhythm on the left.
EEG [**2141-10-26**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU video EEG study due to paroxysmal and, at times, periodic epileptiform discharges in the right occipital pole in the context of a continuous focal delta activity suggestive of a large structural lesion in that region.
There are superimposed intermittent electrographic seizures but with no obvious clinical accompaniment.
Background was asymmetric with delta slowing and suppression on the right and [**6-27**] Hz posterior dominant rhythm on the left.
Multiple areas of restricted diffusion with associated FLAIR and T2 hyperintensity in bilateral frontal, parietal, right posterior temporal and occipital lobes, right thalamus and right superior cerebellar vermis.
The distribution of the lesions make the possibility of these being infarcts more likely than being due to seizures.
No evidence of hemorrhagic transformation of the infarcts.
Generalized cerebral atrophy with extensive changes of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
CTA HEAD AND NECK [**2141-10-27**]: IMPRESSION: Moderate atherosclerotic calcifications of the cervical carotid bifurcations with no evidence of critical stenosis.
There is no evidence of critical stenosis or aneurysms in the circle of [**Location (un) 431**].
Evolution of the bilateral parietal infarction, with associated vasogenic edema, producing effacement of the sulci on the right parietal lobe as described above, there is no evidence of hemorrhagic transformation.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 4027**] is a 58 year old male with past medical history of alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by gastric varices, encephalopathy and recurrent GI bleeding admitted for concern for variceal bleeding after biopsy of mass at the gastroesophageal (GE)junction, found to have R MCA and PCA territoty infarcts once awakened from sedation.
ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM: # GE junction bleed: Endoscopy by hepatology showed clotted off lesion which could be hematoma at the site of arterial bleed or variceal bleed.
The patient had a trauma line placed, and serial HCTs were monitored.
He was also started on ceftriaxone for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis.
# New right hemispheric stroke: As sedation was weaned, it became apparent that the patient had left hemiparesis and loss of leftward gaze.
Additionally, he continued to have focal occipital seizures even after increasing antiepileptics.
The patient also had evidence of upper motor neuron signs, with upgoing Babinski, hyperreflexia, and rigid tone on the left side.
CT head/neck without contrast was negative for acute process.
EEG showed abnormal epileptiform discharges (the patient has a history of seizures).
MRI showed early subacute infarcts in bilateral frontal, parietal, right posterior temporal and occipital lobes, right thalamus and right superior cerebellar vermis; there are of different chronicity and likely thromboembolic in etiology.
TTE showed aortic regurgitation and aortic stenosis and bubble study was done showing no PFO.
# Seizures:  The patient has a history of alcohol withdrawal and post-op seizures.
EEG showed abnormal epileptiform discharges; hundreds of briefly sustained electrographic seizures from the right occipital area with occasional spread to the left occiput.
# Fevers:  The patient started spiking fevers while in the MICU.
No infectious source was found, but there was a possible RLL infiltrate on CXR and the patient was empirically started on cefepime.
The patient was never ill-appearing, however, and it was thought that his fevers could be medication related or neurogenic fevers, given his new onset stroke.
Alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by cirrhosis and encephalopathy: Hepatology was following the patient, and he was continued on PPI [**Hospital1 **], and was started on ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis.
The patient's home lasix, spironolactone, propranolol were in the setting of the UGIB, but eventually were restarted with no issues.
11. quetiapine 25 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO Q12H (every 12 hours) as needed for agitation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right sided MCA and PCA territory infarcts   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
NEURO EXAM: rambling, mildly paranoid speech, L arm > L leg weakness, extinction to DSS on L   Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 4027**], You were seen in the hospital because you need an EGD, but during this procedure you had some bleeding, that led to you needing to be intubated.
6) We STARTED you on SEROQUEL 12.5mg every 12 hours as needed for agitation.
