Past Medical History: Past Oncology History: Patient is a 33 year old female who was diagnosed with AML in [**4-/2141**] when a left pleural effusion was found to contain myeloblasts, with an inititally negative bone marrow biopsy.
At that time she presented with SOB and CP and was intubated at [**Hospital3 **].
She had recurrence of disease in [**12/2141**] with a left pleural effusion and circulating blasts.
Hospitalizations have been complicated by admissions for neutropenic fever, VRE bacteremia, and C. difficile infection.
Repeat BM Bx in [**5-/2142**] showed a hypocellular marrow with blasts.
She finally underwent MRD-allo-SCT on [**2142-6-29**] for recurrent disease.
Patient did well until [**8-31**], when she presented with fevers and was treated for a S. Viridans and Bacillus cereus bacteremia.
Asthma 2.
History of right popliteal DVT in [**2141-4-27**] 4.
History of malignant pleural effusions L sided persistent since [**8-31**] 5.
History of chemotherapy induced cardiomyopathy with EF 25%, improved w/ EF 50% on echo [**8-/2142**]; cardiomegaly on CXR since [**8-31**] 6. b/l knee pain due to erythropeoitic conversion versus leukemic infiltrate on MRI 7.
Anemia due to AML and chemo baseline 26% 8.
Persistent thrombocytopenia with splenomegaly baseline 10 9.
Hepatomegaly and transaminitis, elevated alkaline phosphatase 10.
Neutropenia since [**2142-12-1**] due to chemo, w/persistent blasts; admitted 11/10-13/05 for neutropenic fever.
11. h/o intermittent pericardial effusions.
Family History: There is no known history of leukemia, lymphoma, or other cancers.
Her mother has nephrolithiasis and HTN.
Neck: JVP at mandible, distended EJ rises with inspiration Cardiac: tachy rate, regular, no rub, murmurs, or gallops appreciated, extrem cool, pulses 2+ b/l equal, cap refill <2 s Pulmonary: shallow breathing, mild accessory mm use, poor air movement, decreased bs [**3-30**] way up on R>L Abdomen: quiet bowel sounds, mildly tender RUQ and LUQ, nondistended, +HSM.
IMAGING: ECG: sinus tach, reg, left axis, nl intervals, + alternans, nl voltage, no ischemic ST/TW changes seen in wavy baseline Chest x-ray: Persistent left pleural effusion with atelectasis/consolidation at the left lung base.
No saddle embolus but no further comment can be made.
Bilat pleural effusions with associated atelectasis/consolidation, unchanged.
Moderate to large pericardial effusion.
No bowel obstruction or acute pathology in abdomen.
No color doppler studies were performed to evaluate either mitral or aortic regurgitation.
(see above)  6.There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a large pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape unavailable for review) of [**2142-10-12**], the effusion is circumferential but somewhat loculated given that there is a larger collection of pericardial fluid laterally to the left ventricular and posterior to the right ventricle.
There is a large pleural effusion present.
Hypoxic respiratory failure: A large pericardial effusion was noted on echo and CT.
The SOB however improved on steroids and may have been related to a post platelet tranfusion reation.
Pleural effusion was stable.
TTE showed large retrocardiac pericardial effusion, but no tamponade physiology.
The Left pleural effusion was also not drained because the risk of a pneumothorax.
A CTA was done to evaluate for PE and showed no saddle embolus, but was inadequate due to respiratory motion.
She continued to have orthopnea, but her shortness of breath has markedly improved since admission.
She was evaluated for thoracentesis on the day of discharge, but her Left pleural effusion was thought to be too small to be tapped.
AML: She had recurrent disease after 7+3 induction and consolidation.
She was continued on prophylaxis with Bactrim, levofloxacin, acyclovir and voriconazole.
Given her HTN and tachycardia on the floor, however, we restarted her metoprolol to increase filling time for a larger SV and CO. .
