HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was a 56-year-old woman who presented to the Emergency Department on the morning of admission after experiencing five minutes of loss of consciousness at home.
The patient reportedly had symptoms consistent with a urinary tract infection on the morning prior to admission and was prescribed levofloxacin and metronidazole.
She subsequently experienced nausea, vomiting, and coughing, and experienced loss of consciousness after taking the above antibiotics.
The patient's sister, who was present during this episode of loss of consciousness, stated that the patient fell to the ground with her arms straightened and subsequently began drooling.
There was no postictal confusion.
The patient reportedly denied fever, chills, sweats, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, or diaphoresis.
She reportedly had recently had an upper respiratory tract infection.
She also had epistaxis lasting two to three minutes on the day prior to admission.
The patient was admitted to the Medicine Service on the day of admission for evaluation of syncope versus seizure, but subsequently had a cardiac arrest in the Emergency Department.
Subsequent cardiac monitoring demonstrated ventricular fibrillation.
Stage III-B cervical cancer, status post chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and pelvic exenteration with an ileal colonic urinary diversion and end-sigmoid colostomy.
Thrombocytopenia in [**2175-9-13**].
History of bilateral hydronephrosis.
Her mother had hypertension and an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, there were no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
The colostomy site was clean with soft stool at the ostomy site and there was no splenomegaly.
Extremities:  She had faintly palpable DP pulses bilaterally, warm extremities, and there was no pitting edema.
Neurologic:  She had fixed pupils, as noted above, no response to painful stimuli, 1+ biceps and brachioradialis reflexes bilaterally, and no patellar or ankle reflexes.
Her initial urinalysis demonstrated positive nitrate, large blood, greater than 300 protein, moderate leukocyte esterase, 0-2 red blood cells, 0-2 white blood cells, moderate bacteria, no yeast, and no epithelial cells.
Initial chest x-ray done before her arrest demonstrated no evidence of CHF, pneumonia, lymphadenopathy, or intrathoracic metastases.
An EKG done after the patient's arrest demonstrated sinus rhythm, ventricular bigeminy with two ventricular foci, poor R wave progression in leads V1 through V4 consistent with an old anteroseptal myocardial infarction, and otherwise no new findings.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  A repeat head CT scan done in route to the CCU from the Emergency Department demonstrated no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, or stroke.
An echocardiogram done on the day of admission demonstrated an elongated left atrium, normal left ventricular cavity size, severely depressed overall left ventricular systolic function with global hypokinesis and septal hypokinesis, a dilated right ventricle, and a very small pericardial effusion.
Most remarkably, however, much of the right ventricular cavity and outflow tract was noted to be filled with an echodense mass that was suspicious for tumor versus thrombus with a smaller mobile mass prolapsing across the tricuspid valve into the right atrium.
A chest MRI was done two days later that again demonstrated a mass within the right ventricle that appeared to be adherent to the septal wall.
This mass was most likely felt to be metastatic carcinoma versus metastatic melanoma versus a new primary malignancy.
Because the patient had persistently fixed and dilated pupils in the face of persistent unresponsiveness to painful, verbal, or tactile stimuli, The patient's prognosis was deemed to be extremely poor, and no intervention upon the right ventricular mass was undertaken.
The patient was felt to likely have a significant anoxic brain injury secondary to her prolonged cardiac arrest.
Of note, she had an MRI of the head done two days after admission that demonstrated likely cortical infarctions involving the temporal and posterior parietal lobes as well as lacunar infarctions in the cerebellum.
By [**2177-3-8**], the patient's neurologic function remained very poor and was essentially unchanged; she had minimally reactive pupils bilaterally, scant response to painful stimuli, and no response to the Babinski test with evidence of new stroke as noted in the above MRI report.
The Neurology Service deemed her chance of any meaningful neurologic recovery to be at best 5%.
The family understood that pursuing an aggressive course would likely involve tracheostomy, percutaneous feeding tube placement, and prolonged rehabilitation with no guarantee that the patient's underlying cardiac pathology, most likely a tumor versus thrombus of the right ventricle, would not again cause cardiac arrest.
