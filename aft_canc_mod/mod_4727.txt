Admission Date:  [**2142-6-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-6-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2076-12-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: vancomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Decrease in lateral visual fields  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2142-6-20**]: Craniotomy and resection of left occipital mass   History of Present Illness: 65m who had noticed decrease visual fields in his periphery over the last 4-5 weeks.
This prompted him to go see his opthamologist where he discovered a central homonymous visual field abnormality and obtained an MRI.
The MRI shows a 3.6x2.0x2.4cm mass with surrounding edema.
He denies any headache, speech difficulty, motor weakness or seizure activity.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements, heel to shin  PHYSICAL EXAM UPON DISCHARGE: intact  Pertinent Results: MRI Brain [**6-20**] Large, 5.5-cm partially cystic, partially solid enhancing mass in the left occipital lobe with surrounding vasogenic edema- demonstrated for surgical planning.
DDx includes metastasis versus primary neoplasm of glial/other origin.
Vasogenic edema, unchanged, with negligible shift of the midline structures and no evidence of central herniation.
Extensive blood products within the medial inferior aspect of the resection cavity for the known cystic and solid mass which limits the sensitivity for evaluation of residual tumor.
No discrete areas of abnormal enhancement identified.
Apparent increased T2 signal intensity in the left tranverse sinus likely related to slow flow, though recommend attention on followup imaging.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was electively admitted and underwent a craniotomy and mass resection.
Surgery was without complication and he was transferred to the ICU for close neurological observation.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: left occipital mass   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
