[**2112-5-19**] CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2112-5-19**]): FECES NEGATIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2112-5-6**] IMPRESSION: Slight increase in size to moderate left-sided pleural effusion with probable underlying compression atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
EGD  [**2112-5-7**] Impression: Erythema in the fundus compatible with mild gastritis .
Colonoscopy [**2112-5-7**] Impression: Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids Polyp at 14cm in the proximal rectum (polypectomy) Diverticulosis of the proximal sigmoid colon and mid-sigmoid colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum .
CT-head without contrast [**2112-5-11**] IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intracranial pathology, including no sign of intracranial hemorrhage.
Note added at attending review: There is a region of hypodensity in the left cerebellar hemisphere suggesting an acute to subacute superior cerebellar artery distribution infarction.
The region is too well defined and hypodense to represent a hyperacute infarction, such as a few hours old.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage.
Evolving left superior cerebellar artery territory infarct as above.
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
Small bubbles of pneumatosis involving the adjacent ascending colon again noted.
Persistent diffuse edema and ascites in the setting of cardiomegaly.
Persistent bilateral pleural effusions.
KUB - [**2112-5-18**] IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in size of distended loops of bowel, most prominent in the cecum, and suggestion of bowel wall thickening.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 33344**] is an 81 year old male with PMHx significant for PE (on coumadin), afib, dialated cardiomyopathy (LVEF 55%), valvular heart disease who presents to the ED with GIB in the setting of supratherapeutic INR (22).
His course was complicated by a cerebellar stroke.
## Anemia - He presented with a HCT of 12.5 and confusion for some time per his family and melana.
Given the melana, this was thought to most likely be a upper GI bleed secondary to supratheraputic INR (22 on admission).
An EGD was performed which showed only mild gastritis and no active bleeding.
A colonoscopy showed moderate diverticulosis but also no signs of active bleeding.
## Stroke - The night of his colonoscopy, he was found to be unresponsive and flacid.
The CT scan showed a left superior cerebellar stroke which they felt was subacute.
The next morning he had a brief episode of slurred speech and left sided weakness when the neurology consult team was in the room.
These symptoms resolved by the time the medical team arrived.
He was sent for a head CT and CTA which showed a patent cerbellar vasculature, but persistent cerbellar stroke.
He likely is having embolic events from his a fib and lack of anticoagulation given his severe GI bleed.
He was mildly fluid overloaded during admission.
His beta blocker was held given his hypotension on admission and his GI bleed.
This was likely a pre-renal azotemia and resolved with volume expansion with IVF and blood products.
## H/O of PE - Patient with history of PE in [**12-7**] however CTA [**9-8**] did not show any PE.
## Afib - Patient was rate controlled even without metoprolol.
His coumadin was held given the GI bleeding and supratherapeutic INR.
## Pleural Effusion - Patient has a history of pleural effusion which has been tapped several times over the last year.
The source is unknown but could be related to asbestosis or other malignant process.
## Hypernatremia - Most likely volume depletion from blood loss as it resolved with correction of fluid status.
per sliding scale Subcutaneous QACHS: Patient has very little insulin requirement.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Supratherapeutic INR GI bleed Cerebellar stroke.
