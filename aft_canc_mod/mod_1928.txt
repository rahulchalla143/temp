En bloc resection of involved small bowel, abdominal     wall and mass of tumor with primary jejunoileal     anastomosis.
[**2139-11-20**]: Pt with SVC syndrome, went through R IJ CVC access site and baloon dilated svc/RBCV with improved flow.
History of Present Illness: Patient is 55 yo male with h/o Crohn's disease and hypercoagulable condition s/p multiple amputations as a complication of this who presents for increasing low back pain and failure to care for himself at home.
Pt was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 2177**] for [**Hospital1 **] and found to have line sepsis and new dx of stage IV mucinous adenocarcinoma from fungating mass originating from enterocutaneous fistula.
The patient also had multiple episodes of anemia characterized by a HCT drop from 24-25.

No definite evidence of metastatic disease.
Heterogeneous enhancement of segment 4 of the liver likely represents perfusion abnormality, no focal liver lesions are seen.
Ovoid lesion in the splenic hilum is of uncertain etiology but stable in size.
No gastric lesion found [**10-1**] PET/CT: No definite metastatic disease.
[**10-6**] stress test: LVEF 63%, normal perfusion [**11-18**] CXR: little change, bilat pleural eff and bibasilar atelectasis, no vascular congestion or acute PNA [**11-19**] CT abd: Increased pleural effusion, now moderate bilaterally, with adjacent compressive atelectasis.

Pt was started on oxycodone for his low back pain which was likely due to old L4 compression fracture.
Pt was afebrile on admission but then spiked [**Month/Year (2) **] on [**9-29**].
Pt initially defervesced but then spiked again on [**10-3**] and was empirically started on Ceftaz with suspicion for abdominal wall cellulitis as there was noted to be increased redness around fistula site.
Pt remained afebrile and antibiotics were discontinued on [**10-7**].
Pt was continued on steriods for his Crohn's disease and remained on Lovenox anticoagulation for his antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis and PET scan had been negative for metastatic disease.
On [**10-12**], the pt was taken to the OR for an exploratory laparotomy and extensive lysis of adhesions, choledochojejunostomy, en bloc resection of involved small bowel, abdominal wall and mass of tumor with primary jejunoileal anastomosis, and veritas patch closure of abdominal wall defect.
He did require multiple fluid boluses for oliguria following surgery.
However, it was noticed that the pt then began having bilious output from his surgical drain.
He was made NPO and was scheduled to have a CT scan to rule out a leak.
While being prepped for a CT scan, the pt was found to be unresponsive with agonal breathing and decrease in oxygen saturations.
The pt had a head CT which was negative for stroke or hemorrhage.
An abd CT scan showed thrombosis in the superior mesenteric artery and the right common iliac artery, unchanged since [**2139-9-29**], post-surgical changes following small bowel resection, and prominent small and large bowel loops consistent with ileus.
He was ruled out for MI, pancultured, and started on broad spectrum abx.
The pt was started on a clear liquid diet and started having increased drainage from his abdominal wound.
It was soon discovered that the cause of this increased drainage was a recurrence of an enterocutaneous fistula.
The VAC dressing was discontinued and the pt had a wound appliance applied to his wound.
The pt was draining a few liters of fluid daily from this wound and pt was given crystalloid for his wound losses.
Eventually, the fistula output did slow down as the pt decreased his liquid intake and increased his solid food intake.
Granulation tissue appeared healthy and his overall abdominal wound size decreased significantly.
His fistula continued to put out green colored fluid throughout his entire admission requiring frequent dressing changes.
He became febrile at 101.3.
A CXR was performed which suggested bilateral effusions versus atelectasis.
A limited venogram was obtained which revealed stenosis of the right subclavian and right IJ vein and low flow distally, suggestive of a possible brachieocephalic vein stenosis/SVC syndrome.
No thrombosis was seen.
His chest CT reveals moderate sized bilateral effusions.
His abdomen did not reveal any fluid collections/abscesses.
Body CT was consulted for thoracocentesis of these collections.
A MR venogram was obtained which showed thrombosis of left SV, IJ, right IJ, right BC, stenosis of superior SVC, and persistent b/l pleural effusions.
On [**12-7**], patient went to Interventational Pulmonology for possible thoracentesis, and pleurex catheter for draining any possible fluid.
CXR noted LLL effusion which has been persistent.
[**12-16**] medical/surgical condition remains stable.
Moist dressing will be applied to keep wound bed from drying.
