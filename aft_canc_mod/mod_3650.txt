Admission Date:  [**2178-3-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-3-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2134-6-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Betadine / Grapefruit  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**] Chief Complaint: rectal cancer work-up  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 43 year old male with history of poorly differentiated laryngeal cancer with known metastasis to bone (lymphoepithelioma), recently completed XRT for bone mets presented to an OSH [**3-4**] for abdominal distention and pain.
Scans revealed rectal narrowing and liver lesions by CT scan.
Patient underwent colonoscopy which showed changes consistent with radiation proctitis and subsequently started on steroids.
Despite this therapy symptoms persisted and the patient underwent repeat colonoscopy, which was concerning for rectal narrowing [**3-20**] extrinsic mass.
The patient as reported to have urinary urgency at the outside.
Eval revealed normal post-void residual but evidence of moderate outflow obstruction.
CT scan revealed bladder wall thickening likely related to radiation injury.
Patient's management at OSH was additionally complicated by renal failure with a Cr bump from 1.1 to 2.7, thought possibly to be [**3-20**] contrast nephropathy from CT on [**3-18**].
Laryngeal cancer (primary in epiglottis) - neo-adjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery (regimen unknown) - radical neck dissection [**2177-5-17**], metastasis to thoracic/L3 regions of spine, sacrum, ribs, R and L pelvis (PET scan - [**2177-11-16**]) - radiation therapy to lumbar and thoracic regions 2.
Back surgeries due to trauma   Social History: SH: Heavy smoking history, quit last year.
Family History: FH: Lung cancer in sister, breast cancer in sister.
Nervous, anxious appearing.
HEENT: No conjunctival pallor, no icterus.
No JVD appreciated.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**] LUNGS: CTAB, no crackles appreciated.
NEURO: A&Ox3 but with thought finding difficulties.
[**2178-3-21**] CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: I see no radiopaque central venous line.
A region of heterogenous opacification just to the right of the upper mediastinum could be due to a mass or region of consolidation.
Followup and/or cross sectional imaging advised.
There is no pleural effusion.
[**2178-3-22**] Portable abdomen.
IMPRESSION: AP view of the abdomen shows gaseous distension of the large bowel, but no appreciable small bowel distension.
This may represent distal colonic obstruction.
There is no free intraperitoneal gas.
[**2178-3-22**] Renal Ultrasound.
IMPRESSION: Mild hydronephrosis within the left kidney.
Patchy bilateral ground glass opacities.
The appearance is more suggestive of atypical infection, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia or a drug- related pneumonitis, as opposed to metastatic disease 2.
There is also a recent or acute non-displaced right posterolateral eighth rib fracture, and findings suggestive of acute on chronic injury of the left lateral sixth rib, again without displacement.
Persistent contrast opacification of the renal cortices bilaterally with mild bilateral hydronephrosis.
Diffuse involvement of the liver with metastatic disease.
Dilatation of the transverse colon, probably reflecting partial obstruction by a rectal mass, which is demonstrated as diffuse thickening of the rectum on images performed with rectal contrast opacification of the lumen.
The appearance includes rectal edema, soft tissue and nodularity, probably reflecting small suspicious lymph nodes.
No evidence of hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures.
Diffuse lytic lesions seen throughout the calvarium.
Increased soft tissue density seen at the posterior orbits bilaterally, possibly representing metastatic disease.
The patient arrived at the [**Hospital1 18**] in renal failure and oliguric.
This was felt likely due to the bilateral hydronephrosis seen on CT scan.
He was noted to be febrile to 101.8 and tachycardic to the 130s.
The patient had severe constipation which was felt to be due to radiation associated colitis, metastatic obstruction, or narcotic side effect.
CT Torso and CT head both showed diffuse osteometastatic disease.
In the end the patient's pain was managed with concentrated morphine and an IV morphine drip.
Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Diffusely metastatic laryngeal cancer.
