Admission Date: [**2177-7-4**]        Discharge Date: [**2177-7-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2120-11-27**]        Sex:  F  Service:  VSU   CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Extensive pelvic tumor and clot involving the IVC and right atrium.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56 year-old over the last two to four weeks has noted progressive fatigue and "hay fever" allergies.
Twelve days ago she felt pressure at mid chest that lasted three to four hours and she felt it was more difficult to breath.
She saw her physician who felt maybe it was secondary to anxiety.
She went to her primary care physician regarding the abnormal liver function tests findings and he felt maybe it was secondary to gallstones.
The patient had a CT of the abdomen, which revealed a pelvic mass with clot versus tumor, which extended into the right atrium.
She also noted additional symptoms of "queasiness" in the bowel times one week.
This was felt from mild regurgitation, but no actual [**Month/Year (2) **] emesis or diarrhea.
Pneumonia in childhood.
Multiple seasonal allergies.
Nasal septal surgery.
Status post dilatation and curettage.
Lorabid reaction unknown.
Intravenous heparin.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for breast cancer mother at 51 and grandfather cerebrovascular accident.
REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  Significant for fatigue and otherwise is unremarkable.
General appearance the patient is a white female in no acute distress.
Heart is a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
There is no tenderness.
CTA of the pelvic vessels was negative for embolization.
CT of the abdomen was a pelvic mass with IVC clot versus tumor, which extended to the right atrium.
There was a focal wall motion abnormalities that could not be fully excluded.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The right atrial mass could not adequately be assessed by transesophageal echocardiogram.
There was a cystic mass in the IVC on the right atrial junction consistent with probable neoplastic process.
Although thrombus could not be excluded, but because of the complex nature of the mass it is suggestive of tumor.
The patient underwent transesophageal echocardiogram, which confirmed IVC mass and extension into the right atrium.
Cardiothoracic felt that they could not make recommendations regarding the patient secondary awaiting further imaging.
The MRV, which was done on [**7-8**] demonstrated right gonadal vein was markedly extended secondary to thrombus.
Correlation with recent CT confirms that the thrombus does extend into the right atrium and gadolinium enhanced images demonstrate marked contrast enhancement of the thrombus in the atrial phase prior to arrival of venous return to the inferior vena cava.
The arterial phase images demonstrated a normal appearance in the abdominal aorta, iliac arteries and major aortic branches.
Of note, there are markedly hypertrophied arteries feeding the massive tumor in the pelvis, which appeared to represent hypertrophied uterine arteries right greater then left.
Initial CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrate pelvic mass with tumor thrombus extending into the right gonadal vein with extension to the IVC at the level of the right atrial junction with extension into the proximal left renal vein.
There is mass centered in the region of the uterus and likely represents a malignant neoplasm.
There is prominent retroperitoneal lymph nodes and a simple hepatic cyst.
After consultation with the involved services, thoracic, vascular and gyn/oncology it was determined that the patient undergo an abdominal exploration and excision of mass.
The patient underwent on [**2177-7-11**] total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo oophorectomy, resection of  the tumor from ovarian vein and IVC,k resection of mesenteric lymph node.
Intraoperative findings showed an enlarged uterus about 20 week size (uterus) with bilateral invasion of tumor into the ovaries and parenchyma.
Dressings were with staining serous drainage.
There were no bowel sounds.
The patient required intravenous bolus for low urinary output.
Venodynes for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
