Admission Date:  [**2109-6-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2109-7-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2047-12-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5547**] Chief Complaint: Dysphagia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Exploratory laparotomy, radical resection of liposarcoma en bloc including total gastrectomy and roux-en-y esophagojejunostomy, reimplantation of right common hepatic artery onto the celiac origin of the abdominal aorta, and partial resection of L hemidiaphragm with primary repair, L chest tube thoracostomy [**2109-6-27**] Bronchoalveolar lavage, [**2109-6-30**] PICC line placement, [**2109-7-7**] L chest pigtail placement, [**2109-7-11**] Exploratory laparotomy, attempted repair of aortoenteric fistula with attempt at primary repair and attempt at endovascular stent placement [**2109-7-12**]  History of Present Illness: 61-year-old female had previously undergone resection of a left retroperitoneal liposarcoma with an en bloc distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, left adrenalectomy, and left nephrectomy in [**2104-8-20**].
The final pathology was a well-differentiated retroperitoneal liposarcoma with sclerosis with tumor focally present at the margins.
She was followed expectantly without recurrence of disease until [**Month (only) 216**] of last year when she developed dysphagia.
A CT colonography, performed in [**Month (only) 404**] of this year as a routine colorectal screening test, identified a 5 x 7 cm soft tissue mass in the region of the GE junction.
Further imaging confirmed this mass to be inseparable from the aorta and celiac axis and intimately associated with the distal esophagus and proximal stomach.
A CT scan of the chest ruled out metastatic disease to the lungs.
Patient received preoperative radiation therapy, which she tolerated well with improvement in her symptoms of dysphagia, although the mass appeared to increase slightly in size on cross-sectional imaging.
Given the lack of other effective treatments for a well-differentiated liposarcoma and the low likelihood of developing distant metastatic disease in the near term, she was offered an attempt at en bloc resection for local control, which she agreed to do.
There is no other family history of malignancy.
Neck and supraclavicular fossae are supple without adenopathy.
Abdomen shows a well-healed left paramedian incision without hernia.
There is some mild tenderness in the epigastrium.
There is a poorly defined mass in the upper abdomen.
There is no hepatomegaly.
There is no ascites.
On POD 3, the chest tube was placed to water seal but a LLL collapse was noted on CXR, prompting a bronchoalveolar lavage for successful clearance of a mucus plug, which improved her respiratory status.
The NJ tube was removed and, on POD 6, an UGI demonstrated no anastamotic leak, permitting intiation of an oral diet with sips progressing to clears.
The output from the JP drain was newly noted to be feculent with an amylase nearly 4000, although she displayed no signs of abdominal sepsis.
A CT abdomen/pelvis was performed on POD 8, demonstrating oral contrast extravasation into the LUQ in the region of the JP drain, with associated L pleural effusion and atelectasis.
An operative exploration for repair of the enterotomy was offered to the patient, who declined, and local control of the leak was managed with the existing JP drain.
Antibiotic coverage consisted of Vanco, Cipro, Flagyl, coincident with a coag-negative staph UTI.
Repeat abdominal CT scan on POD 12 demonstrated minimal interval change.
Thoracic surgery was consulted for the persistent pleural effusion, with concerns of possible feculent spillage, so a pigtail catheter was placed by interventional pulmonology on POD 14, finding clear serous fluid.
A few hours later, around noontime, another episode of hematochezia occurred, this time more significant, and she was intubated for profound hypotension.
She required more transfusions and crystalloid to maintain a sufficient blood pressure; a femoral arterial line and internal jugular central venous line were placed.
Because of her hemodynamic instability, it was decided to bring her to the operating room, in conjunction with discussion and consent from the family, with involvement of vascular surgery for question of arterioenteric fistula.
Please see operative notes for details, but in brief it was discovered that she had a large-size aortoesophageal fistula with poor tissue quality of the thoracic aorta, presumably infected, preventing successful repair.
