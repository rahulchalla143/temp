Microbiology: [**2148-5-24**] 3:30 pm URINE URINE CULTURE (Final [**2148-5-25**]):    NO GROWTH.
MRI head [**5-27**]: Findings of small vessel ischemic changes, unchanged from the prior examination.

Head CT [**6-15**]: No acute intracranial pathology to explain the patient's nausea identified.
No abnormal enhancement or mass effect identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 year old M with CLL d+8 of CEPP, s/p [**Hospital1 **] regimen and s/p recent admission for abdominal pain secondary to ileus, who is admitted for febrile neutropenia to 101F and increased dry cough.
Moreover, patient had cough, perhaps indicative of pulmonary process.
Differential diagnosis included bacterial, fungal, viral infection given neutropenia.
CXR did not show any signs of an acute process.
He complained of a funny feeling in his throat on [**5-25**], and was cultured.
CXR on [**5-28**] showed vol overload, but no overt infiltrate.
CT [**5-29**] showed: progression of multiple patchy nodular opacities associated with peribronchial thickening and ground-glass opacity predominantly in centrilobular distribution, most prominent in right middle lobe, involving both upper and lower lobes, worsened compared to the prior study, most likely worsening infectious process with persistent bilateral axillary, mediastinal, abdominal, and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
ID concerned for fungal process.
started on bactrim 360mg IV q8, with premedication with compazine, anzemet and olanzapine prior to dose for h/o projectile vomitting with bactrim.
Patient with 4-5L O2 demand [**6-4**], also with shaking to 1 unit prbc's, blood stopped, sent to lab for transfusion reaction analysis but no evidence of reaction.
He was improving with decreasing O2 demand and tried oral bactrim [**6-6**] to see if he could complete his course at home however he had uncontrolable nausea and vomitted with aspiration and desaturation to 50% and was placed on 100% NRB and went to 98%.
He was treated with levofloxacin and flagyl for 1 week out of concern for aspiration pneumonia but he improved so rapidly that it was likely a sterile aspiration.
Once his prednisone was completed, he began a taper to prevent adrenal insufficiency.
He was treated with G-CSF for 6 days as ANC responded well and he was no longer neutropenic.
Over [**Date range (1) 6291**] he was noted to have rapidly increasing bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy.
He had a portacath placed [**6-19**] for further therapy.
3 Somnolence: On [**5-27**], he had an episode of worsening mental status with lethargy, as well as fevers to 102.
Narcan was administered with slight effect.
He was restarted on effexor out of concern for depressed mood but tapered off again as he may need procarbazine in the future.
He was evaluated by GI who felt that mechanical obstruction was not likely to be contributing and that there was no indication for endoscopy at this time.
He also had a speech therapy evaluation of swallowing to see if that might be contributing, which was notable for coordinated mastication and swallowing.
# Anemia:  A possible chemo effect vs suppression from infection was considered.
# Sleep Disordered Breathing: He has a history of sleep disordered breathing and has been on Bipap in the past but had not used his machine for 9 months prior to admission but his machine was tried [**6-5**] to improve sats while sleeping with minimal improvement prior to aspiration event, but it was not continued after this event.
