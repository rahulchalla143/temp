There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Very limited study as the patient was unable to cooperate.
Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with hyperdynamic systolic function.
Could not fully assess for valvular disease or LVOT obstruction.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2110-2-19**] 4:30 AM IMPRESSION: Right hydropneumothorax with decreased air and increased fluid components.
Stable right lower lung opacification likely a combination of atelectasis and effusion, though cannot exclude pneumonia.
Chest tube is in place on the right with fluid collecting in the region of previous pneumothorax.
Opacification at the right base is consistent with a fusion plus compressive atelectasis.
No change in the appearance of the right hemithorax including loculated pleural effusion and most likely presence of loculated pneumothorax is seen.
Left lung is essentially clear except for interval development of left pleural effusion and most likely secondary atelectasis.
There is a minimal increase in fluid that fills the lateral pleural partially air-filled space.
In unchanged manner, parenchymal opacities are seen in the paramediastinal right lung areas.
Unremarkable left lung with trace retrocardiac and left basal atelectasis.
Unchanged right Port-A-Cath  PATHOLOGY: Pleural fluid [**2110-2-7**]: POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA.
MICROBIOLOGY: BCx [**2110-2-19**]: negative C diff toxin [**2110-2-26**]: ______________  Brief Hospital Course: 59 yo F w/ adenocarcinoma w/ presumed involvement of her bones, uterus and lung but currently of unknown primary s/p planned admission for right pleurodesis and pleurex catheter placement complicated by pneumothorax and new onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
# R Pleural effusion with pneumothorax: likely due to injury to pleural viscera and adhesions.
# Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: Morning of [**2-19**] patient developed afib with RVR with heart rates to the 160s-190s.
Due to hypotension after receiving IV Metoprolol and poor rate control with IV Diltiazem patient was transferred to the MICU.
Discussion with patient was had regarding anticoagulation given new onset atrial fibrillation.
Patient was made aware of the slightly increased risk of stroke with this heart rhythm and warning signs of stroke.
# Side effects from chemotherapy/Deconditioning from prolonged hospitalization: patient experienced significant nausea/vomiting with her chemotherapy which was managed with standing dexamethasone, zofran and ativan.
# Adenocarcinoma of unknown origin: Pt has presumed involvement of bone, lung and uterus from prior scans.
Outpatient workup for identification of primary tumor has been unsuccessful so far.
Her outpatient oncologist believes that it is most likely upper GI primary malignancy.
# Lower extremity pain/edema: Patient was negative for DVT per LENIs.
She has been experiencing increased sensitivity in LE since initiation of chemotherapy.
# HTN: patient's home lisinopril was held due to hyptension from atrial fibrillation, especially as she was normotensive on her new metoprolol and diltiazem.
