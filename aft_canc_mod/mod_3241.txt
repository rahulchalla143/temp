He was found to have metastatic urothelial cancer, and underwent several cycles of systemic chemotherapy.
Due to an impressive response to his chemotherapy and a lack of utility with further chemotherapy per his oncologist, the patient presented for a left nephroureterectomy.
Past Medical History: HTN, bladder & L renal pelvic TCC s/p O.R./BCG/chemo, COPD/emphysema, hypothyroid, GERD, acute pancreatitis '[**55**], CRI (Cr 1.6), anemia, B12 deficiency, BPH  Social History: cigars x 55y (quit '[**55**]); denies IVDA/EtOH  Physical Exam: Sitting in bed, comfortable RRR Lungs with mild wheezes bilaterally, very mildly decreased breath sounds at bases Abd S, NT, ND, left flank incision c/d/i, no signs of erythema.
Immediately post-operatively, he was hypertensive in the PACU requiring doses of labetalol (patient has significant hypertension at baseline).
He progressed slowly with his post-operative course - his pain was initially controlled on a combination of a dilaudid PCA and a Bupivicaine PCEA.
Of note, on POD 1, he had an acute hypotensive episode resulting in a call for code blue.
He was found unresponsive sitting in the chair and was moved quickly to the bed, after which his systolic blood pressure was noted to be <70 mmHg.
He was also noted to have dysarthria and decreased movement in his right arm.
This defect was transient, and resolved after laying the patient down in bed and administering fluid, which slightly improved his systolic blood pressure.
A head CT was performed, which was negative for acute intracranial hemorrhage.
He did have some episodes of transient delirium while in the ICU, which resolved after being transferred to the floor on POD 3.
While in the ICU, a chest Xray was performed which showed opacification of the R lower and middle lobes suspicious for pneumonia.
During his hospitalization, he was also evaluated by the renal service for severe hypertension with SBP > 180.
On POD 3, some erythema was noted around his L flank incision and IV vancomycin was started.
His nasal cannula oxygen was weaned to off before discharge with ambulation and chest physiotherapy.
He was discharged ambulating, with his pain adequately controlled on PO pain meds, tolerating a regular diet, and with his foley catheter draining well.
