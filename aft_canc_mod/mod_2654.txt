Sagittal imaging was performed with long TR, long TE fast spin echo and short TR, short TE spin echo technique.
No prior cervical spine imaging studies are available for comparison.
There is a focus of hyperintensity on the short TR images in the C6 vertebral body, perhaps reflecting focal fat deposition or a small hemangioma.
Vertebral body signal intensity is otherwise normal.
There are degenerative changes of the intervertebral discs with loss of signal and loss of height, most prominent from C4 through C7.
There are small intervertebral osteophytes at C5-6 and C6-7.
There is no abnormal enhancement after contrast administration.
There is degenerative disc disease with mild encroachment on the spinal canal.
There is no abnormal enhancement after contrast administration.

Sagittal and axial imaging was performed with long TR, long TE fast spin echo and short TR, short TE spin echo technique.
No prior thoracic spine imaging studies are available for comparison.
This maintains high signal intensity on the short TR images suggesting that it is not acute.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please eval for pancreatic mass CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
CLINICAL HISTORY: Patient with pancreatic mass that was biopsied and suspected to be carcinoma.
Surgical evaluation for extent of disease and resectability.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST: There is atelectasis of the lung bases dependently, as before.
The two hypodense lesions within segment IV of the liver are unchanged in size and appearance.
The larger lesion shows mild enhancement and may represnet focal hepatic edema from cholangitis or a metastatic focus.
No new liver lesions.
Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is unchanged as is pneumobilia.
No definite pancreatic mass is seen, though one is suspected with the common bile duct and pancreatic duct dilation.
This appears mildly increased since the prior study.
Within the pancreatic tail, there is a 5 mm round fluid attenuation lesion that could represent side branch IPMT or another pancreatic cystic lesion.
The spleen, bilateral adrenal glands and bowel within the abdomen are normal in appearance.
There are focal low attenuation lesions within the kidneys bilaterally that likely represent cysts.
No lymphadenopathy within the abdomen by CT size criteria, though there are sub-cm lymph nodes within the portacaval space and retroperitoneum.
There is descending colon and sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
BONE WINDOWS: There is an old compression fracture at T11 with focal kyphosis.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic bone lesions.
IMPRESSION: 1) No pancreatic mass seen, though one is suspected with the biliary and pancreatic duct dilation.
The pancreatic duct dilation is slightly increased from the prior study with unchanged biliary duct dilation with stent in place.
2) Two hypodense liver lesions within segment 4, with the larger 2 cm lesion showing mild enhancement.
This raises the question that this is a metastasis, though edema from cholangitis is a consideration.
Even though the biopsy was negative, a short term follow up of this lesion is recommended in [**4-10**] weeks to assess for interval change in case there was biopsy sampling error.

Since that time, she has had progressive weakness of her legs greater than her arms.
She has not noted any diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, or dyspnea.
She reports pain in both legs, which has improved since her hospital admission.
Directed neurological examination shows moderate wasting of distal muscles in the lower extremities.
There is mild-to-moderate proximal and distal weakness in bilateral upper extremities, worse in the left arm than the right arm.
There is moderate-to-severe weakness in bilateral lower extremities, both proximally and distally.
Reflexes are decreased in bilateral upper extremities and absent at the knees and ankles.
This study was requested to evaluate for polyneuropathy and motor neuron disease.
FINDINGS:  Motor NCSs of the left median nerve showed borderline normal response amplitude, mildly reduced conduction velocity, and normal F responses.
Motor NCSs of the left ulnar nerve showed mildly reduced response amplitude and mildly reduced conduction velocities.
Motor NCSs of the left deep peroneal nerve showed normal distal latency, moderately reduced response amplitudes, normal conduction velocity in the leg, and markedly reduced conduction velocity across the fibular neck.
Motor NCSs of the right deep peroneal nerve showed moderately reduced response amplitudes and markedly reduced conduction velocities.
Motor nerve conduction studies (NCSs) of the left tibial nerve showed normal distal latency, markedly reduced response amplitudes, and mildly reduced conduction velocity.
Motor NCSs of the right tibial nerve showed moderately prolonged distal latency, moderately reduced response amplitudes, and moderately reduced conduction velocity.
Motor NCSs of the left common peroneal nerve recording tibialis anterior showed moderately reduced response amplitudes and normal conduction velocity.
Ten seconds of exercise failed to produce an incremental response upon stimulation of the left deep peroneal nerve.
Sensory NCS of the left ulnar nerve showed normal response amplitude and mildly reduced conduction velocity.
Concentric needle electromyography (EMG) of selected muscles representing the left L2-S1 myotomes was performed.
There was marked, ongoing denervation in tibialis anterior with moderate polyphasia and poor activation.
EMG of left gastrocnemius and long head of biceps femoris was normal with the exception of fair activation.

EMG of right tibialis anterior showed marked, ongoing denervation with fair activation and markedly reduced recruitment.
EMG of left first dorsal interosseous showed moderate, ongoing denervation with fair activation.
EMG of left triceps showed mild polyphasia and slightly reduced recruitment.
IMPRESSION:  Complex, abnormal study.
The electrophysiologic findings are most consistent with a moderately severe, subacute (between 3 weeks and 3 months duration) neurogenic disorder, which is motor > sensory and non-length dependent in distribution.
Compared with this prior study, there has been progression of the neurogenic process.
Her weakness started around the time that her adenoma was diagnosed, and slowly progressed.
She already has shortening of the achilles tendons due to her weakness.
Neuro: MRI head, C/T spine showed no evidence of disease aside from some small vessel changes and some degenrative bony changes.
EMG most consistent with a moderately severe, subacute (between 3 weeks and 3 months duration) neurogenic disorder, which is motor > sensory and non-length dependent in distribution.
Sural nerve biopsy showed no pathological feature.
The patient's weakness has thus, not been diagnosed, yet.
There are features of her weakness consistent with both peripheral and central involvement and while a paraneoplastic process is still suspected, there is no objective evidence for this diagnosis.
Oncologic workup hs yielded only suggestive evidence of malignancy (pancreatic duct dilatation).
SHe required BiPAP for a few days but her NIFs steadily improved and then normalized without acute intervention.
GI/Oncologic: Pt with mildly elevated amylase and lipase after her biliary stent placement.
