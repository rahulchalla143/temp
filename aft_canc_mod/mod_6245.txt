Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation at outside hospital RIJ placement at OSH and replacement at [**Hospital1 18**] Lumbar Puncture NGT placement GJ tube placement  History of Present Illness: A 68 year-old female with history of cerebrovascular accident x 3, left tonsillar carcinoma, no known history of seizures presenting to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital [**2113-11-30**] with new onset convulsive seizures.
She was unable to protect her airway and was intubated in the ED, complicated due to her radiation for tonsillar cancer.
She had no history of head trauma and CT head x 2 showed multiple old ischemic changes but no new process.
EEG x 3 showed persistent epileptiform activity in the left cerebral hemishere, however, unclear when the EEGs were performed relative to the convulsive seizures.
She has been treated with phenobarbital, fosphenytoin, intermittent ativan, and a midazolam drip for her seizures.
Chest x-ray after intubation showed a developing infiltrate at the right lung base, which improved on subsequent imaging.
She was on diflucan as an outpatient for a fungal urinary tract infection and this was continued during her admission.
Past Medical History: - Cerebrovascular accident x 3, last [**5-/2113**] - Left-sided squamous cell tonsillar cancer status post radiation and "a few cycles" of Erbitux - History of encephalopathy suspected secondary to Erbitux use, status post Acyctlovir for potential herpetic encephalitis [**9-/2113**] - negative EEG at that time - History of Erbitux related lung toxicity versus aspiration pneumonitis [**9-/2113**] - Hyperthyroidism on propylthiouracil - Chronic atrial fibrillation/flutter, rate-controlled with digoxin and diltiazem, on coumadin in the past but not currently  - History of [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans urinary tract infection   Social History: Patient was originally from [**State 622**] and moved ~3 years ago to [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 **], when se re-married.
She has history of severe alcohol abuse and intoxication with withdrawal and seizures.
Family History: Sister with ovarian cancer.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions and increased retrocardiac opacity likely representing atelectasis.
CXR: [**2113-12-17**] A single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates a nasogastric tube coiled in the stomach.
The left basilar atelectasis seen on the previous study has resolved.
MRI [**2113-12-8**]: TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images were obtained before gadolinium.
T2 and FLAIR coronal images of the temporal lobes acquired.
There are no prior examinations for comparison.
FINDINGS: Images through the brain demonstrate mild-to-moderate brain atrophy and moderate changes of small vessel disease with a chronic cortical infarct in the left parietal lobe and chronic infarct in the right basal ganglia putaminal region.
There is no mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus.
No acute infarct.
Diffusion images demonstrate a tiny area of increased signal in the left frontal cortical region which is too small to characterize on ADC map.
Coronal images through the temporal lobes demonstrate hippocampal atrophy but no intrinsic signal abnormalities are seen.
IMPRESSION: Chronic left parietal and right basal ganglia infarcts.
Small vessel disease and brain atrophy.
Tiny area of increased signal on diffusion in the left frontal cortical region is too small to characterize on the ADC map and could be due to either a tiny acute infarct or T2 shine through.
Limited gadolinium images demonstrate no large area of enhancement.
Chronic micro hemorrhages are seen in the right basal ganglia, left temporal region which could be due to previous ischemia.
Video Swallow: Moderate oral and pharyngeal dysphagia resulting in penetration during the swallow and subsequent aspiration after the swallow on all consistencies.
Less than 40% stenosis in the right and left internal carotid arteries.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 year-old female with history of cerebrovascular accident x 3, tonsillar carcinoma, no known history of seizures transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital with seizures and fevers.
OSH EEG x 3 have shown persistent epileptiform activity from a focus in the left cerebral hemisphere, without ability for continuous EEG monitoring ??????
There were electrolyte abnormalities on admission, however, the patient persisted with seizures after correction.
She had no history of head trauma and CT head x 2 showed multiple old ischemic changes but no new process.
Patient has history of cancer and may have metastasis ??????
EEG without seizure and phenobarbital was discontinued [**12-9**].
MRI no evidence of encephalitis, so acyclovir discontinued.
MRI does show what could be new embolic stroke in left frontal cortical region where OSH saw seizure activity.
There were not any seizures at this hospital and the etiology was unknown, but thought to be multifactorial in the setting of possible infection and new embolic stroke.
# Fevers, leukocytosis: Unclear etiology - seizures versus infection vs drug related.
RIJ in place since [**12-2**] without erythema or discharge.
However, since AMS and fever made high the suspicion for infection patient was treated empirically with Vancomycin, ceftriazone, ampicillin.
There was question of hospital acquired PNA and patient only grew MRSA from sputum.
Antibiotics were stopped on [**2113-12-14**] and has been afebrile since then.
Was treated for aspiration pneumonia with ceftriaxone and clindamycin for an unknown course.
Patient was extubated on [**12-13**] without complications.
She uses facemask only to humidify air since there is concern for thick mucus and plugging, with difficulty clearing secretions.
# Atrial flutter: Rate-controlled with digoxin and diltiazem.
Since patient has documented chronic AFib, we do not think she will benefit from ablation at this point, and she will still require anticoagulation for secondary stroke prevention.
# Anemia: Normocytic with stable HCT in the low 30s during this hospitalizaion.
Patient was guaiac negative and with ferritin of 1159 suggesting anemia of chronic disease.
# Squamous cell tonsillar cancer: Status post chemoradiation.
No acute issues.
Patient was seen by ENT who did not see any mass or lession in throat.
They could not rule out cystic lesion.
# Access: Peripherals.
# Code: DNR, but ok to intubate if respiratory failure.
# Disposition: To Rehab.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospital of [**Location (un) **] and Islands  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: new onset seizures Possible new stroke .
Secondary Diagnosis: History of Cerebrovascular accident x 3 History of squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil s/p radiation and chemotherapy with Erbitux (3 cycles) History of encephalopathy of [**Last Name (un) 6722**] etiology: Erbitux vs HSV Paroxismal Atrial Fibrillation / Atrial Flutter   Discharge Condition: Stable, alert, obeys commands and answers Y/N questions, tolerating tube feeds.
Patient needs mitts occasionaly to protect IVs and PEG since she gets very agitated occasionally.
You had a lumbar puncture to rule out infection in the brain.
You had a few episodes of abnormal heart rhythm that were controlled with medications and coumadin.
You were also seen by ENT to assess for your tonsilar cancer.
