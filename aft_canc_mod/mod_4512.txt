Admission Date:  [**2130-7-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-7-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2077-1-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2130-7-3**] Thoracentesis  History of Present Illness: 53 year old man with a history of recurrent/metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma (originally clinical stage IIIB uT3 uN1 cM0) s/p proctosigmoidectomy with end colostomy and chemotherapy and radiation who presents with one week of worsening shortness of breath.
It was discussed that his last CT chest shows an increased right pleural effusion and that this could be the likely etiology of the increased work of breathing and oxygen requirement.
Pt was previously supplied a prednisone taper for shortness of breath/wheezing for about 1 week, which finished on [**2130-6-27**].
He completed palliative radiation to L3-L4 vertebral metastasis on [**2130-6-27**].
A discussion was also held about his overall prognosis given ongoing disease progression in his lungs, despite palliative irinotecan and cetuximab.
At that time, he was experiencing SOB with any exertion, using O2 2L NC when up and around.
A chest x-ray was done, which showed moderated R sided pleural effusion and bilateral interstitial abnormalities.
CTA on [**6-7**] for DOE was negative for PE and CT torso on [**6-26**] showed infiltrative multifocal adenocarcinoma metastatic to the lung appears slightly worse with now increased septal thickening and pleural scalloping concerning for pleural involvement as well as increased right pleural effusion since the CTA.
Bronchial brushings from RUL on [**4-24**] were postiive for malignant cells, consisetn with metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma.
Past Oncologic History: - [**3-/2128**]: Noted progressive rectal discomfort.
- [**2128-4-28**]: Underwent CT scan due to worsening rectal pain.
This  revealed focal wall thickening at the rectosigmoid junction, which was thought to be consistent with a perirectal abscess.
- [**2128-5-7**]: Underwent diagnostic colonoscopy with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; a digital rectal exam prior to the procedure revealed a  "hard rectal mass" and, on colonoscopy, he was found to have "a  frond-like villous nonobstructing large mass" within the distal  rectum that was partially circumferential.
A biopsy was taken, pathology of which demonstrated high-grade invasive adenocarcinoma with signet ring cell features.
It localized the mass to the left posterolateral rectal wall and described "son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence suggesting breakthrough of the muscularis propria with invasion  into the perirectal fat ... there appeared to be an extension of the mass into other adjacent structures, including the internal anal sphincter".
- [**2128-6-7**]: Began neoadjuvant chemoradiation with infusional 5FU (225 mg/m2/day); 50.4 Gy radiation given by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]; completed [**2128-7-15**] - [**2128-10-4**]: Underwent abdominoperineal resection with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**];  pathology revealed a high-grade signet ring rectal adenocarcinoma which invaded through the muscularis propria into the perirectal soft tissues (ypT3); 35 of 36 lymph nodes were involved with carcinoma (ypN2b); intra-operatively, the left pelvic sidewall was noted to have suspicious thickened tissue and radial surgical margins were positive in this area; gold fiducials were placed intra-operatively to the left pelvic sidewall; tumor was microsatellite stable (MSS); KRAS wild-type  - [**11-12**] - [**2128-11-18**]: Underwent CyberKnife (25 Gy in five fractions) to the left pelvic sidewall at the site of his positive margin.
- 10/26/1: Began cycle 1 of adjuvant chemotherapy with modified  FOLFOX6; completed sixth/final cycle [**2129-5-3**] - [**2129-9-27**]: CT Torso done to evaluate elevated CEA revealed new retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, two ground-glass opacities in the right upper and lower lobes of the lungs, and a new 8 mm lesion at the dome of the liver, all consistent with recurrent/metastatic disease.
- [**2129-10-31**]: Began cycle 1 of palliative FOLFIRI and bevacizumab;  completed 6 cycles prior to disease progression (confirmed by transbronchial biopsy of a worsening infiltrative lesion in the  right upper lobe of the lung on [**2130-4-24**]) - [**2130-5-8**]: Began cycle 1 day 1 of palliative weekly irinotecan (120 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 of 28-day cycle) and cetuximab (250 mg/m2 weekly after 400 mg/m2 loading dose on cycle 1 day 1)  - [**2130-6-21**]: Began palliative radiation to L4 vertebral metastasis  (20 Gy given over five 4 Gy treatments); chemo held during treatment  Social History: (per OMR) He lives in [**Location 47**] with his wife,[**Name (NI) **]; they have 3 grown children.
Family History: (per OMR) Several cousins on the paternal side with breast, ovarian cancer at young ages, and there is no history of colorectal cancer or other cancers.

These are consistent with known metastatic deposits.
There is a right-sided pleural effusion which is moderate.
There is a left-sided Port-A-Cath with the distal lead tip in the distal SVC.
[**2130-7-3**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): There are again seen airspace opacities throughout both lung fields more confluent within the right middle lobe at the site of known metastatic disease.
There is a right-sided pleural effusion with some loculation along the lateral chest wall which does appear stable.
There is mild improvement of the pulmonary interstitial edema since the previous study.
There is a left-sided Port-A-Cath with the distal lead tip in the mid SVC, stable.
[**2130-7-3**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY: No pulmonary embolus.
Marked six-day interval increase in growth of multiple mass-like opacities within the lungs, now with diffuse peribronchovascular ground glass opacity.
The bilateral pleural effusions with scalloped margins have also increased in the interim.
Upon a background of metastatic adenocarcinoma, the marked interval change over six days suggests superimposed infection, recommend clinical correlation for this.
Two enhancing liver lesions as described above.
[**2130-7-3**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): There are again seen diffuse airspace opacities more confluent in the right upper lobe consistent with known metastatic disease.
There has been reduction in the size of the right basilar pleural effusion and there is a right basilar chest tube.
No significant pneumothorax is seen on either side.
There is a left sided Port-A-Cath with the distal lead tip in the mid SVC.
[**2130-7-4**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**4-24**] through [**7-3**]:  Moderately-severe pulmonary edema which was present on [**7-3**], at 1:18 a.m. has improved, but there are now greater areas of consolidation in both lungs, partially in the upper lobe on the right and in several regions of the left lung, all an indication of progressive multifocal pneumonia.
Small right pleural effusion persists following insertion of a pleural drainage catheter.
Tiny right apical pneumothorax is new or newly apparent.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 53 year old man with a history of recurrent/metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma who presents with one week of worsening shortness of breath  # hypoxic respiratory failure - Likely multifactorial and contribued to by fluid overload, increasing right-sided pleural effusion, progression of GGOs and lymphangitic spread of adenocarcinoma, as well as possibility of infection.
The driving factor, however, does seem to be disease progression of his metastatic adenocarcinoma.
He was diuresed initially with some improvement in respiratory status and also had his R-sided pleural effusion drained for 1L w/ pigtail placement also with very mild improvement.
Additionally, repeat chest CT scan r/o PE but showed significant progression of GGOs and mets.
His outpatient oncologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] who felt that decline was likley reflective of disease progression.
Initial sputum culture showed gram positive rods on gram stain, but no significant organisms other than commensal respiratory flora grew out.
Furthermore, pleural fluid showed no organisms.
On [**2130-7-9**], dyspnea worsened and he became increasingly hypoxic and no longer responsive.
Pt's family was called to the bedside and it was determined that we continue to treat his dyspnea with morphine.
# Metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma - Diagnosed [**5-/2128**] and is s/p proctosigmoidectomy with end colostomy with known metastases to the lung and spine.
He has completed 6 cycles of palliative FOLFIRI and bevacizumab, as well as 2 cycles of Ironotecan and Cetuximab and recently finished 5 sessions of palliative radiation to L3-L4 metastases.
# Transaminitis - Previous records report that it is presumably due to hepatotoxicity from his external beam radiation, but could also be due to his chemotherapy.
Hepatitis serologies were recently checked, which showed immunization to hep B and neg for hep C.  # Altered Mental status: The patient developed marked confusion in the setting of recieving ativan, in addition to the initiation of steroids.
However, as mentioned above, he ultimately became unresponsive as his clinical status declined.
