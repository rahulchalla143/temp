Overnight she developed recurrent left chest/shoulder pain while ambulating to the bathroom and an increase in her oxygen requirement.
On the am of transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she developed acute tachycardia to 170s while ambulating to the bathroom and progressive hypoxia with sat in mid 90s on 5L facemask.
Repeat CXR obtained at that time demonstrated increasing left pleural effusion.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer monitoring and consideration of non-invasive ventilation.
She noted her SOB was improved but continued with left shoulder/chest pain.
Past Medical History: HTN malignant melanoma (see below) .
Oncologic history (per OMR): Ms. [**Known lastname 32058**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] shave biopsy of a left eyebrow skin lesion revealing a 1.3 mm thick, [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level IV, non-ulcerated melanoma with 15 mitoses per high-powered field in 12/[**2112**].
In [**12/2113**], she [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] wide local excision and left parotid sentinel lymph node biopsy.
There was no sentinel lymph node biopsy involvement with melanoma.
Wide local excision revealed residual melanoma extending to 4.5 mm thick, [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level IV with evidence of microsatellitosis.
She [**Doctor Last Name 1834**] punch biopsy of a right forearm lesion in [**2115-5-24**] revealing microinvasive melanoma, [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level II, 0.22 mm, extending to the peripheral specimen margins.
She [**Doctor Last Name 1834**] wide local excision in [**2115-6-23**] revealing focal residual melanoma in situ, completely excised.
On her three-year followup scans in [**3-1**], her torso CT revealed multiple lung nodules with a large left hemidiaphragm lesion measuring 7.9 x 6.3 x 3.7 cm.
Biopsy was positive for melanoma.

No pulmonary embolism.
Marked interval increase in size of metastatic lesions at the left lung base, now associated with a large, and likely malignant, left pleural effusion.
The right paraesophageal mass has also increased in size with other small bilateral pulmonary nodules again noted.
[**4-7**] CXR : Large left and small right pleural effusion, unchanged.
Dense LLL opacity likely a combination of known mass atelectasis and effusion.
Widened right lower paramediastinal region part of it is likely due to known paraesophageal mass.
Brief Hospital Course: 73 yo F with metastatic melanoma with acute presentation of malignant pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis with short-interval reacummulation concerning for hemothorax from melanoma.
Respiratory Distress, hypercapnic/mild hypoxia - [**1-25**] effusion, space occupying lesion, underlying COPD, respiratory depression from narcotics.
Possible PE but unable to anticoagulate [**1-25**] hemorrhagic effusion.
In setting of hemothorax from melanoma there are few options for treatment.
Metastatic Melanoma - Mets to pleural space, likely hemorrhagic, prognosis poor.
