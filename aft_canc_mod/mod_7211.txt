Admission Date: [**2118-6-3**]        Discharge Date: [**2118-7-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2061-2-6**]        Sex:  M  Service:  OME   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 57-year-old male with Burkitt's type lymphoma originally diagnosed in [**12/2117**] following a six week history of fatigue, night sweats, and adenopathy, and testicular enlargement.
Pathology revealed diffuse replacement of the nodal architecture with extranodal invasion of the surrounding fat consistent with a high-grade lymphoid neoplasia.
A lumbar puncture was performed which showed cerebrospinal fluid involvement and an Ommaya shunt was placed on [**2117-12-19**].
Status post admission for high-dose methotrexate from [**2118-2-3**] to [**2118-2-9**]; status post admission for IVAC cycle number four but discontinued prematurely for pneumonia in [**2-/2118**]; status post IVAC without Ifosfamide in 01/[**2118**].
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As per History of Present Illness, pyloric stenosis, ventricular hypertrophy, history of ventricular ectopy and hypercholesterolemia.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, in no acute distress.
Anicteric sclerae.
Neck:  Supple, no lymphadenopathy.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Infectious Disease:  Following transplant patient developed fever and neutropenia and was treated with empiric antibiotics although remained febrile.
His potential sources included severe mucositis as well as CT evidence of sinusitis.
He subsequently had multiple blood cultures and a catheter tip from a right IJ line grew positive for Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.
This acute change in transfer prompted a transfer to the MICU for an overnight stay, upon which he dramatically improved following the removal of the right IJ line.
Acute renal failure:  Patient developed rising creatinine to a peak of 2.2 from a baseline of 0.6.
The initial insult was felt to be multifactorial due to cyclosporin toxicity and sepsis from the VRE.
CMV:  Patient had ongoing diarrhea, abdominal distention and abdominal pain with decreased appetite.
He underwent an endoscopy and colonoscopy which the endoscopy revealed esophagus with denuded mucosa, a heaped up mass at the gastroesophageal junction, and an 8 mm ulcer in the antrum with the clots just above recent bleed.
Biopsies in the stomach revealed evidence of CMV.
Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea:  There was a question of graft-versus-host disease as the cause for this.
Eventually he underwent the endoscopy and colonoscopy described above which showed no evidence of graft- versus-host disease.
Paralyzed right vocal cord:  Patient developed hoarseness, therefore, underwent ENT evaluation which showed paralysis of the right vocal cord.
He underwent MRI to look for any compressive lesion of the recurrent laryngeal nerve.
The ENT team therefore felt that the cause was idiopathic or viral, and the possibility of a spontaneous recovery.
Right groin fluid collection:  Patient with a recurrent fluid collection in right inguinal area.
After the last drain there was no recurrence.
FINAL DIAGNOSES:  Burkitt's type lymphoma.
Vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia.
Acute renal failure.
Right vocal cord paralysis.
