Admission Date:  [**2170-1-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2170-2-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2129-6-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Hydralazine / Pyridium / Bactrim / Nitrofurantoin / Dapsone / Quinine / Quinidine / Methylene Blue  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 19193**] Chief Complaint: fatigue, poor PO intake, abdominal discomfort  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 1557**] is a 40-year-old man with medical history of [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 93502**] disease (glycogen storage disease) who presented with fatigue, poor PO intake, and abdominal pain.
Per his father, [**Name (NI) **] has not been doing well since he completed alpha interferon at the end of [**10/2169**] for treatment of his liver adenomas.
He denies any fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or diarrhea.
The patient does admit to increasing bilateral lower extremity edema over the past 2 weeks.
His BS's have been difficult to control at home since he is not always compliant with his cornstarch due to fatigue.
Given his constellation of symptoms he was recommended to go to the ED by his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
Patient was initially started on D10W with close monitoring of his blood sugars which was then changed to 1/2 NS given his lactic acidosis.
Mr. [**Known lastname 1557**] also underwent a CT scan abd/pelvis in ED which showed a possible ruptured adenoma.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted in mid-[**Month (only) 404**] for anemia and was admitted for blood transfusions.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: T 97.0 BP 129/67 HR 116 RR 25 O2 sat 100% RA Gen: Patient appears acutely ill, severely cachectic, older than stated age HEENT: MMM Heart: Sinus tachycardia, no audible m,r,g Lungs: CTAB, no crackles Abdomen: Markedly distended, hard to palpation, visible veins.
IMAGING STUDIES: 1)Cxray ([**1-18**]): No evidence of pneumonia.
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
Massively enlarged liver with innumerable heterogenous masses most consistent with adenomas.
Extraluminal pooling of contrast are concerning for active intra- tumoral hemorrhage in the most inferiorly located tumor mass in the right hepatic lobe.
A targeted ultrasound of this area is recommended for further evaluation of possible intra- tumoral hemorrhage vs. venous lakes.
Marked tumor neovascularity within the liver, especially the left lobe which is near completely replaced with tumor.
Hepatocellular carcinoma within these areas cannot be excluded.
3)RUQ U/S ([**1-18**]):  Well-defined, focal hypoechoic areas which show slow internal flow within the most inferior right-sided hepatic mass most likely represent internal venous lakes   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1557**] is a 40-year-old man with history of glycogen storage disease who presented with worsening fatigue, poor PO intake, and abdominal discomfort.
* Glycogen storage disease: AG metabolic acidosis on presentation, secondary to hypoglycemia.
Due to loose stools, the patient could not tolerate cornstarch for several days, but by discharge diarrhea had resolved, and the patient had been taking cornstarch for 2 days, with stable fingersticks.
No apparent source of infection was identified.
Abdominal CT revealed no abscess.
He was empirically started on Zosyn on admission which was stopped after 48 hours because of no evidence for an active infection.
When he developed loose stools later in the hospital course, metronidazole was started for presumed C. diff and completed by discharge.
The WBC trended down but remained elevated at 15 by discharge.
Patient was afebrile during hospitalization.
* Recent diarrhea: with persistent leukocytosis.
Concern for anemia of chronic disease, in setting of hepatic adenomas.
* Elevated LFTs/coagulopathy: presented with elevated ALT/AST/alk phos, likely in setting of extensive hepatic adenomas.
INR remained elevated around 1.6-1.7, suggesting underlying synthetic dysfunction.
* LE and scrotal edema: likely from low albumin, and with infusion of IVF during hospital stay.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: lactic acidosis  Secondary diagnosis: glycogen storage disease   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and poor appetite.
You were found to have hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and lactic acidosis, consistent with your glycogen storage disease.
You refused infusion of D10 1/2NS for glucose control.
Cornstarch was started then stopped due to diarrhea.
Work-up for the diarrhea revealed no apparent cause.
If you develop any fevers, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, recurrent diarrhea, or any other symptoms that concern you, please call your doctor or go to the nearest Emergency Room.
