She has been having persistent symptoms since summer [**2177**] when she was diagnosed with a pneumonia and completed a course of cefpodoxime/azithromycin.
During the week PTA, the patient had progressively worsening cough, shortness of breath and fever.
Her fever curve hit maximum at 101.9.
She wasn't able to perform her usual daily functions at home due to profound fatigue and decided to go to [**Location (un) 620**] for further evaluation.
On [**8-14**], the patient had a chest x-ray which showed a left lower lobe pneumonia with progression and worsening.
She had a CXR concerning for pna and was given cefepime.
Currently, she is resting in bed but having ongoing cough and shortness of breath.

CXR [**2178-8-26**] IMPRESSION: Unchanged left apical tiny pneumothorax.
Bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis are stable since the previous exam.
After receiving a CT scan for the PNA, she was found to have a pericardial effusion that was evaluated by ultrasound.
She received a pericardial window for cardiac tamponade presumably from a malignant effusion, as well as a bronchoscopy which took several transbronchial biopsies.
She was transferred to the MICU, and was eventually called out to the cardiology floor, for management of new paroxysmal afib with RVR while the etiology of her left lung mass was being worked up.
She was transferred to the oncology floor after her initial pathology results showed malignant cells c/w adenocarcinoma.
ACTIVE PROBLEMS BY ISSUES: .
# Malignancy adenocarcinoma: CT showed that since [**2178-7-6**], her left lower lobe consolidation has significantly progressed with unchanged bulk of the bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes; interlobular interstitial septal thickening in left lower lobe persists.
After pathology from her bronchoscopy (lymph node and LLL mass Bx's) were positive for malignant cells consistent with adenocarcinoma, heme-onc was consulted and she was transferred to the oncology floor.
# Pericardial effusion: CT thorax showed evidence of pericardial effusion.
Pt c/o SOB, and TTE showed evidence of tamponade physiology.
Repeat TTE showed evidence of returned pericardial effusion with evidence of loculation and tamponade physiology.
CT surgery was consulted and agreed that patient needed urgent pericardial window operation.
Likely etiology of the effusion was malignancy in the context of LLL consolidation and pleural effusion with likely post-obstructive PNA.
The pt c/o constant dyspnea and was maintained on several L of O2 with sats in the mid-90's; she was started on low doses of morphine to treat dyspnea and air hunger on [**8-24**], which gave her significant symptomatic improvement.
# Pneumonia:  She likely had a post-obstructive pneumonia due to the lung mass seen on CT chest one month ago.
A repeat CT chest was performed and showed the mass was amenable to bronchoscopic biopsy.
She was treated with cefepime and metronidazole for 10 days each for concern for anaerobes and resistant gram negatives.
Her cough and lung exam initially improved, but on [**8-24**] her dyspnea increased, she had persisting opacities on CXR and slowly increasing WBC, and so zosyn, and levofloxacin were started.
She tolerated this regimen and her symptoms improved.
She still has intermittent dyspnea and coughing that is well controlled with morhpine.
# Paroxysmal afib: New onset this admission in MICU on morning of [**8-20**].
Since undergoing surgery for placement of pericardial window, pt has been intermittently in atrial fibrillation with RVR to 130s.
Patient was symptomatic during RVR episodes with dyspnea, with systolic blood pressures 90-100s (baseline SBP appears to be 100s-120s).
Deferred starting anticoagulation with aspirin given CHADS2-vasc score of one in setting of recent procedures.
The cardiologists decided that the isolated episodes of AFIB were likely d/t the pericardial drain.
# Normocytic Anemia: Hct was in low 30's during admission (recent baseline 30-35), MCV 85, RDW 13.
Likely anemia of chronic inflammation; retic count, ferritin, B12/folate are all WNL.
Also could be concerned for hemolysis as she has known autoimmune disease (CREST), but tbili normal and high LDH.
Deferred iron replacement for now given acute illness.
# Lymphadenopathy: She had tender cervical lymphadenopathy and also posterior pharynx adenopathy.
This is likely related to the mass in her lung and biopsies are pending.
# Lacunar stroke: The patient was incidentally found to have a small lacular infarct on MRI.
She exhibited no symptoms.
CHRONIC PROBLEMS BY ISSUE: .
# Limited scleroderma with CREST syndrome: Her symptoms are moderately controlled with Calcium channel blockers at home.
She had some symptoms of worsening esophageal dysmotility due to this.
She was continued on nifedipine and her proton pump inhibitor for esophageal involvement.
# Osteonecrosis of the jaw: History of osteonecrosis secondary to zolandronate.
She was continued on her calcium and vitamin D for prevention as well as ibuprofen for pain control, taken especially with meals.

Disp:*90 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] Nursing & Therapy Center - [**Location 1268**] ([**Location (un) 86**] Center for Rehabilitation and Sub-Acute Care)  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSES: Post-obstructive pneumonia Adenocarcinoma  SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: limited scleroderma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted to the hospital because you were having fevers, fatigue, and persistent cough after your last treatment for pneumonia.
We think the reason that your pneumonia continued is because you had a mass in your lung which was making it difficult for your lungs to clear out the infected mucus.
