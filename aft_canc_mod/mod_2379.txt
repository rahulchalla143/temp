He is readmitted today in the setting of fever and increased cough.
Please see discharge summary from [**2162-6-3**] and [**2162-5-19**] for details of his previous hospitalizations.
In brief, the patient has pseudomonal infection of his lungs, he has been treated with 21 day course of Colistin and Meropenem to treat this, and was on Colistin IH for suppression.
Additionally, he has an upper extremity DVT that, since that admission, is being treated with Fondaparinux 2.5 mg SubQ, lower dose secondary to history of serious GI bleeding.
He had some low bloood pressures, 90/53 and 107/73.
reports increased cough and fevers while at rehab.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: - [**4-/2154**] p/w fevers, night sweats, and weight loss in the setting of a left inguinal lymph node.
- Treated with six cycles of CHOP/Rituxan with good response, but showed evidence for relapse in [**12/2154**] and was treated with MINE chemotherapy for two cycles.
- Multiple GI bleeds requiring ICU admissions and multiple transfusions and embolization of his bleeding.
- Noted to have CNS lesions felt consistent with PTLD and this was treated with a course of Rituxan.
No evidence for recurrence of the PTLD.
- Acute liver GVHD, on CellCept, prednisone, and photophoresis.
- [**2157-12-28**] Photophoresis was d/c'd due to episodes of bacteremia and eventual removal of his apheresis catheter.
- [**2158-6-13**] restarted photopheresis on a weekly basis on , but then discontinued this again on [**2158-9-7**] as this was felt not to be making any impact on his liver function tests.
- undergone phlebotomy due to iron overload with corresponding drop in his ferritin.
He has continued with transient rises in his transaminases and bilirubin and has remained on varying doses of CellCept and prednisone which has been slowly tapered over the time.
- [**2159-1-19**] admission due to increasing right hip pain.
MRI revealed edema and infiltrating process in the psoas muscle bilaterally.
After extensive workup, this was felt related to an infection and required several admissions with completion of antibiotics in 03/[**2158**].
- [**7-/2160**]: Last scans showed no evidence for lymphom and he has remained in remission.
-In [**5-/2161**], noted to have tiny echogenic nodule on abdominal [**Year (4 digits) 950**].
MRI of the liver also showed this nodule but was not as concerning on review and he is due to have a repeat MRI imaging in early [**Month (only) **].
-On [**2161-8-3**], worsening cough and was noted to have a small new pneumothorax in the left apical area.
This has essentially resolved over time - Issues with weight loss (followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]); multiple tests done with no etiology found; question malabsorption related to GVHD - Has on and off respiratory infections and has been treated with antibiotics (now colistin inhaled and IV) for resistant pseudomonas.
Question underlying exacerbations of pulmonary GVHD in setting of his URIs.
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p allo SCT 2.
Grade 4 Acute GVHD of GI/liver following DLI with GI bleed, chronic transaminitis, portal HTN with esophageal varices (not able to band) 3.
History of intracranial lesions felt consistent with PTLD.
Hypothyroidism 8. hx of Psoas muscle infection   Social History: Smoke: never EtOH: none currently; occassional use prior to NHL dx Drugs: never Born in [**Country **] and moved to the U.S. for college ([**Hospital1 **]).
Family History: No lymphoma or other cancers in the family.
Father had CAD s/p PCI.
There has been interval worsening of multifocal bilateral nodular airspace opacities which are most prominent in the right upper lobe, some of which have air bronchograms.
Also noted are numerous tiny centrilobular nodules at the lung bases, right greater than left.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent compressive atelectasis is again identified.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The visualized upper abdominal organs are unchanged in appearance with no gross abnormalities identified.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified within the osseous structures.
Interval worsening of multifocal nodular opacities, most prominent in the right upper lobe compared to prior CT of [**2162-4-27**], which may represent recurrent or residual worsening infection.
Stable moderate bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent airspace disease, which is at least in part secondary to atelectasis.
Redemonstration of secretions within the superior trachea, slightly increased when compared to the prior study.
Additionally, coils projecting over the epigastrium are consistent with embolization coil.
This likely represents components of atelectasis and consolidation.
Bilateral effusions persist.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Multifocal opacities, worse in the retrocardiac and right cardiophrenic regions; unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2162-6-17**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.

He presented with fevers and hypotension.
He complained of increased yellow/white sputum, so it was thought that the source of his fevers was recurrent lung infection.
A CT chest revealed multifocal nodular opacities, most prominent in the right upper lobe consistent with recurrent pneumonia.
ID was closely involved and felt that slow infusion meropenem was appropriate treatment in addition to IV Colistin.
He did well with only occasional low grade fevers and decreased sputum.
Leukocytosis: Mr. [**Known lastname 38598**] presented with an elevated white count of 28 with left shift.
Ventilator dependence: Pt has history of Bronchiolitis Obliterans from allo-SCT with tracheostomy.
He has history of pseudonomas infections and hospitizations for pneumonias.
He had been unable to wean off the vent at rehab and during his previous hospitalization due to increased secretions.
Given his history of massive GI bleed (secondary to GVH of GI)it was decided not to anticoagulate him with theraputiuc doses of heparin.
On [**6-6**] there was questionable right upper extremity swelling in the arm with his PICC.
Day before discharge he had repeat U/S of Left Upper Extremity and showed no progression of clot in brachial v. Decision was made to stop fundaparinox.
NHL: Mr. [**Known lastname 38598**] is status post allo [**Known lastname 3242**] complicated with GVHD of GI and Bronchiolitis obliterans.
