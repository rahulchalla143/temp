Admission Date:  [**2130-2-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-3-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2061-3-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: Cardiac arrest   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catherization PEG tube placement Tracheostomy placement Bronchoscopy ICD placement  History of Present Illness: 68 yo male w/ a h/o NIDDM, htn, metastatic prostate cancer to bone, AF, hyperlipidemia, who is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED s/p cardiac arrest.
Recently had complained of intermittent SOB w/o physical limitation, orthopnea, PND or LE swelling.
Also complained of increased fatigue following most recent chemotherapy treatment for prostate ca 2 weeks ago.
Events and symptoms leading up to collapse unknown except that patient was carrying multiple heavy bags prior to event which is not typical of him to do.
Post arrest ECG showed ST depressions in V3-V6.
His labs were significant for hypokalemia, slightly elevated cardiac biomarkers and LFTs and metabolic acidosis.
His ECG shows sinus rhythm with diffuse T wave flattening and slight inferolateral ST segment depressions.
CXR w/ no acute CP abnormalities and CT of head and neck which suggested a possible basilar artery occlusion, but without associated parenchymal changes or abnormalities.
Neck CT showed no injuries.
While in the ED, patient became hypotensive and more bradycardic and he received an additional 2 mg of atropine along with a dopamine gtt.
Induced hypothermia cooling protocol also initiated.
Pupillary nonreactivity was felt to be most likely secondary to medications, given the rapid resolution and absence of other brainstem signs.
Past Medical History: Cardiac Risk Factors: NIDDM, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension .
Other PMHx: # Metastatic Prostate cancer to bone - on chemo x 15 years # atrial fibrillation # gout # s/p cataracts surgery # s/p knee replacement   Social History: Patient is retired but continues to work in the [**Company **] sporting goods vending industry with his family.

soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

Withdraws to pain in RLE.
ST depressions in I,L, V3-6 and II.
ST elevation in AVR.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
No significant valvular disease seen.
[**2130-2-6**] Head CT, non-contrast: No evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect.
No evidence of displaced fracture or malalignment.
Extensive degenerative changes of the cervical spine with continuous ossification along the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments as well as along the ligamentum flavum.
This raises the question of an underlying ankylosing spondylitis variant, or, when taken in conjunction with the dilated esophagus, possibly a connective tissue disorder.
[**2130-2-8**] Left ankle X-ray: Subacute nondisplaced fracture of the distal left fibula.
Incidental probable myositis ossificans proximal leg.
[**2130-2-14**] Right upper extremity US: Occulusive thrombus within the right cephalic vein consistent with superficial thrombophlebitis.
[**2130-2-14**] Right shoulder x-ray: There is no evidence of an acute bony injury.
[**2130-2-14**] Right hand x-ray: There are degenerative changes but no fracture is seen on the single views.
Coronary angigraphy of this right dominant system revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD was severely diffusely diseased with serial 70-80% focal stenoses in the mid and distal vessel.
The RCA was heavily calcified with a diffusely diseased PDA and 80% PL branch.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided filling pressures with LVEDP of 25 mm Hg.
Left ventriculography revealed no mitral regurgitation with anterolateral hypokinesis and LVEF of 40%.
[**2130-2-12**] MRI BRAIN FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, infarction, edema, or mass effect.
No diffusion abnormalities are detected.
There is no abnormal enhancement after contrast administration.
[**2130-2-12**] MRI THORACIC SPINE IMPRESSION: Small disc protrusion at T7-8 with cord encroachment, but normal signal in the cord.
Intervertebral osteophyte at T8-9 with some cord encroachment.
Fracture of the superior endplate of T10 with gross disruption of the ALL and slight thoracic lordosis without evidence of cord compression at T9-10.
CXR (AP, [**3-1**]): In comparison with study of [**2-28**], diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications persist.
Again this would be consistent with a widespread aspiration pneumonia on a substrate of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
CXR ([**2130-3-6**])(one day after starting steroids): In comparison with study of [**2-4**], there has been a substantial decrease in the opacification in the left perihilar region as well as the upper and lower zones on the right.
TTE ([**2130-3-7**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the anterior, anterolateral, mid to distal anteroseptum walls and akinesis of the apex.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
An eccentric, posterioly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-2-6**], the left ventricular function has significantly decreased with regional wall motion abnormality.
Moderate mitral regurgitation is present.
Rest Thallium ([**2130-3-10**]): Fixed moderate perfusion defect in the distal anterior, apical and lateral segments.
In comparison the diffuse bilateral opacities within the lungs have improved.
There are no pleural effusions and no pneumothorax.
Preliminary workup did not reveal acute ischemic coronary process and no ECG changes were noted.
EP was consulted and the cardiac arrest was thought secondary to ventricular arrhythmia since peri-code strips showed VT althought the source was unclear given no known structural heart disease, no prior history of MI, no CHF symptoms, QTc not significantly prolonged.
Initially family opted not to have ICD placed and wanted it managed medically (given poor neurologic status).
ICD was placed on [**2130-3-13**], a dual chamber [**Company 1543**] Virtuoso via cephalic without complications.
Pt also has a hx of parox atrial fibrillation but remained in NSR throughout the hospital stay after he stabilized from his arrest although he had occasional ectopy.
For his afib he continued to be well rate controlled on metoprolol (when sleeps falls to low 40s but asymptomatic) .
ISCHEMIA Cardiac catheterization was performed and revealed severe three vessel disease.
CT surgery was consulted and after evaluation determined he was not a candidate for CABG due to the severity of CAD and lack of targets for anastomosis; therefore his medical management was optimized wtih ACEI, BB, ASA, statin.
Possible intervention was revisited after his significant neurologic progress at which time a rest MIBI was perform to explore possible salvagable regions but the study demonstrated a fixed moderate perfusion defect in the distal anterior, apical and lateral segments; therefore medical management was recommended.
PULMONARY EDEMA Pt had some pulmoary edema seen on CXR as pulm congestion, echo initally demonstrated EF>55%, then a repeat echo demonstarted EF 35-40% with anterior hypokinesis of the anterior, anterolateral, mid to distal anteroseptum walls and akinesis of the apex.
He continued to have impaired cognition with dysarthria, however, and was unable to protect his airway with oral intake.
There was concern for ongoing aspiration, as well as possible occlusion of his airway by his tongue given poor muscle tone with brain stem injury.
He also required Q30-60 minute deep suctioning for copious secretions, and the decision was made to perform a tracheostomy for long-term care.
Tracheostomy was performed on [**2130-2-23**] without complication.
However, patient had an episode of agitation overnight requiring antipsychotics and benzos and then had worsening respiratory status requiring placement back on the vent.
ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA: The patient was initially treated with flagyl and unasyn for aspiration pneumonia throught to have started during his cardiac arrest.
On [**2130-2-22**], he was noted to have low-grade fever, increasing secretions, and new CXR opacities concerning for recurrent aspiration events.
However, pt developed bilateral opacifications and fever prompting us to restart vanc/zosyn and for IR to place PICC given single peripheral access and anticipating 8 day course of IV abx needed which were finished on [**2130-3-9**] with pt remaining afebrile and with some resolution of infiltrates (which in retrospect may have been caused mostly by amiodarone induced BOOP).
Pt also had moderate sized pleural effusions that were thought to be decreasing in size by the time of discharge.
Since pt never spiked another fever after restarting abx these effusions were NOT thought to be infected and therefore did not need a tap.
CXR showed worsening alveolar infiltrates and bloody secretions were noted from his tracheostomy tube.
Interventional Pulmonology evaluated patient with a bronchoscopy and serial BALs showed progressive hemorrhage consistent with alveolar hemorrhage, thought likely due to combination of a pneumonia and anticoagulation.
Pulmonary were consulted who thought thi was more consistent with amiodarone induced BOOP and steroid were started on [**2130-3-6**] which dramatic improvement overnight in symptoms and in findings on CXR with decrease in bilateral opacification.
Please follow-up with the PFT lab at [**Hospital1 **] for the time and place for this (requested 4 weeks from today) as well as a chest x-ray to check for resolution of the amio-induced BOOP.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Patient had a history of atrial fibrillation and had intermittent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation over the course of his admission.
He was intially managed with beta blockade which was down titrated with addition of amiodarone.
Anticoagulation was held in the setting of alveolar hemorrhage and hematocrit drop and restarted coumadin and lovenox once the BOOP had completely resolved.
T10 VERTEBRAL FRACTURE: The patient was noted to have fallen during his cardiac arrest, and abdominal CT revealed an abnormality of the T10 vertebrae.
MRI of the spine showed fracture of the superior endplate of T10 with gross disruption of the ALL without evidence of cord compression at T9-10.
LEFT DISTAL FIBULA FRACTURE: Ankle x-ray on [**2130-2-8**] revealed a subacute nondisplaced fracture of the distal left fibula, thought to have been sustained during the initial cardiac arrest and fall.
He developed severe bullous dermatitis over his left foot and ankles after wearing the brace for two days, so it was removed.
He will need to have new fitted orthotic device on at all times when weight bearing.
MENTAL STATUS Intially thought to have some level of anoxic brain injury given 30 minutes w/o spontaneous perfusion and GCS of 4 upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] but made tremendous advances and was alert and oriented x3, moving all extremities but with need for significant PT/rehab in recovery.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Cardiac Arrest / Ventricular Fibrillation Respiratory failure Aspiration Pneumonia Amiodarone Induced BOOP Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation .
Secondary diagnosis: NIDDM Dyslipidemia Hypertension Metastatic Prostate cancer to bone - on chemo x 15 years gout s/p cataracts surgery s/p knee replacement   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after you were found unconscious after your heart stopped.
You required intensive support and underwent a special protocol where your body is cooled in order to help your body deal with this severe event.
You have not been able to protect your airway when you eat or swallow, and a special feeding tube had to be inserted in order to help you eat.
You had an ICD placed in order to prevent another cardiac arrest.
You were treated for aspiration pneumonia and had bleeding into your lung from amiodarone induced toxicity.
We also found evidence of a fracture in your left leg and one of your vertebrae; you will need to wear the special brace we provided for you for 6 weeks.
