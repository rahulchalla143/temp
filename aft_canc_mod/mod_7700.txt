********* PATHOLOGY ************ [**2132-10-8**] BONE MARROW BIOPSY : HYPOCELLULAR ERYTHROID-DOMINANT MARROW WITH  ERYTHROID AND MEGAKARYOCYTIC DYSPOIESIS.
NO DIAGNOSTIC MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES OF INVOLVEMENT BY LEUKEMIA SEEN.
Brief Hospital Course: 52 year old male with hx of Ph + ALL D +96 (on admission [**10-6**]) double cord transplant, with history of HHV6 encephalitis, diabetes, adrenal insufficiency & orthostatic hypotension (on fludocortisone), who presented as a transfer for fever to 100.6.
On this admission, he presented fever and was empirically started on vancomycin and cefepime.
He developed a headache on HD2, which was initially thought to be related to IVIG.
CSF studies revealed elevated protein, concerning for viral / aseptic meningitis.
His mental status improved and the etiology of headache and altered mental status remains unclear to date.
He developed acute hypoxemia and was discovered to have an acute pulmonary embolus, provoked by prolonged immobilization and inability to anticoagulate because of thrombocytopenia.
# Submassive pulmonary embolus - The patient developed acute hypoxemia on [**10-14**], was found to have a large pulmonary embolus involving the right main with extension into the upper, middle, and lower segmental arteries, and was started on a heparin drip.
LENI showed bilateral deep venous thrombi, so he was brought emergently to the cath lab for IVC filter placement.
He developed bleeding complications and was found to be supratherapeutic with the 1mg/kg [**Hospital1 **] dosing of enoxaparin, so he was placed on 1mg/kg DAILY enoxaparin, and factor Xa levels were appropriate.
- Anticoagulation should be continued for 6 months for provoked pulmonary embolus, and IVC filter should be removed at the same time (around [**2133-5-15**])  # Fever - Had one isolated fever 101.3 on [**10-12**].
Possible localizing sources:  CNS, line infection, cellulitis (however left lower extremity appeared to be healing well and did not appear to be infected or cellulitic), GI (had watery diarrhea on the day he spiked a fever).
Also possible is foscarnet reaction (has previously had fever & diarrhea with foscarnet).
Because he remained afebrile and his WBC counts recovered, antibiotics were stopped on [**10-14**], and he remained afebrile.
# Ph + ALLO s/p double cord transplant: On Protocol #11-085, reduced intensity conditioning with fludarabine, melphalan, and low dose TBI followed by double umblical cord blood SCT (D 0 [**2132-7-2**]).
Maximun Grade II GVHD of the GI tract while hospitalized, biopsy-proven from EGD [**2132-7-30**], now resolved.
No other evidence for GVHD.
- Prophylaxis was continued with atovaquone, fluconazole.
- Scheduled bone marrow biopsy from [**10-8**] revealed no evidence of leukemia but hypocellular marrow with erythroid & megakaryocytic dyspoiesis  # Pancytopenia:  Chronic pancytopenia likely due to hypoproliferation and recurrent infections.
# Altered mental status / headache / concern for viral encephalitis - Originally presented with headache which improved with IVF, thought most likely related to IVIG received [**10-3**].
CT head was negative for hemorrhage.
The patient had altered mental status [**10-9**].
There was concern for HHV6 encephalitis because the patient has a personal history of HHV6 encephalitis and a persistently elevated HHV6 viral load.
CSF studies were positive for elevated protein, consistent with possible aseptic meningitis, so he was started on foscarnet, but was discontinued when CSF HHV6 was confirmed negative.
Headache and altered mental status improved.
# CMV viremia - He is on valgancyclovir prophylaxis at home.
Valgancyclovir was held in the setting of pancytopenia to allow counts to recover.
He developed a positive CMV viral load.
He was seen by infectious diseases and was discharged on a suppressive dose of valgancyclovir with infectious disease follow-up.
# Orthostatic hypotension:  The patient has a h/o orthostatic hypotension on fludrocortisone at home.
Orthostatic hypotension was unresponsive to IV fluids which suggests he has a degree of adrenal insufficiency.
# Diabetes: Patient developed hypoglycemia while tapering methylprednisone, so home glargine was decreased from 30U to 4U, and he was maintained on a sliding scale with humalog.
Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q24H RX *pantoprazole 40 mg 1 tablet(s) by mouth DAILY Disp #*30 Tablet Refills:*0   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 2203**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary:  Acute lymphocytic leukemia Secondary:  Pulmonary embolus, altered mental status, headaches, adrenal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You came in with a fever and were neutropenic so we started you on antibiotics.
We did not identify a clear source of your fevers but they resolved without antibiotics upon discharge.
Early in your hospitalization, you complained of headaches and we were concerned that you seemed a bit confused, so you got a lumbar puncture because you have a history of HHV6 encephalitis.
You developed blood clots in your legs, which can travel to your lungs.
The treatment for pulmonary embolus is anticoagulation with heparin.
You were seen by dermatology for a skin rash on your right shin.
TRANSITION OF CARE - Please keep platelets > 60,000 while on lovenox - Continue lovenox for 6 months after provoked pulmonary embolus (until ~[**2133-5-15**]) - IVC filter should be removed in 6 months by interventional cardiology (~ [**2133-5-15**]) - CMV levels should be drawn on Friday, [**10-31**], and the dose of valgancyclovir may be changed accordingly  MEDICATION CHANGES - DECREASE dose of tacrolimus to 0.5 mg twice daily - DECREASE dose of methylprednisone to 2mg daily - DECREASE dose of glargine insulin to 4U each night - START enoxaparin injections 90mg DAILY for 6 months - START pantoprazole 40mg daily to protect your stomach from bleeding while you are on lovenox  Followup Instructions: Department: BMT CHAIRS & ROOMS When: FRIDAY [**2132-10-31**] at 9:30 AM  Department: HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY When: FRIDAY [**2132-10-31**] at 9:30 AM With: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8081**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 396**], BSN [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3241**] Building: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) **] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage  Department: HEMATOLOGY/BMT When: FRIDAY [**2132-10-31**] at 10:00 AM With: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 23455**], NP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3237**] Building: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) **] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage  Please make a follow-up appointment in the dermatology clinic 1-2 weeks after discharge or earlier if the rash on your right shin does not resolve.
