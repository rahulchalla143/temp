?s office after presenting with a panic attack and was found on exam to have a new systolic murmur.
A TTE on [**2117-9-30**] showed severe supravalvular pulmonic stenosis with RV hypertrophy and dilation, EF 55%.
She does have a chronic morning cough from post-nasal drip.

Large (~1cm) pigmented lesion on Right upper back with central lack of pigmentation, which pt says has been biopsied by a dermatologist as ??????normal.??????
III/VI systolic murmur loudest at RUSB and LUSB.
No rubs, no S3 or S4      Lungs: CTA      Abd: Soft, non-tender, no masses, no organomegaly.
No calf tenderness.
Pertinent Results: -Chem-7 WNL -CBC WNL -CXR [**2117-9-30**]: unremarkable -Echocardiogram [**2117-9-30**]: possible extrinsic compression of the main pulmonary artery; severe supravalvular pulmonic stenosis; MR imaging or CT scanning recommended to delineate the cause of pulmonic stenosis -CTA [**2117-10-1**]: Low-density lesion in main pulmonary artery, measuring 2 x 3 cm in diameter, with extensive coarse calcification.
The etiology is uncertain, however, this can represent myxoma with calcification, and osteogenic sarcoma.
Diffdx includes neoplasm including metastasis from renal cell carcinoma, or angiosarcoma or other mesenchymal tumor.
Alternatively, this can represent thrombus with calcification or migrated iatrogenic material if the patient has appropriate history.
Scattered calcifications in the main pulmonary artery at the level of the pulmonic valve.
-Repeat creat after CTA Chest and hydration with bicarb: 1.2->1.3 -Panorex films [**2117-10-5**]: WNL  Brief Hospital Course: 66F with h/o anxiety, renal cell CA [**26**] yrs ago sent to ED fr PCP's office after outpt echo showed severe pulm art HTN.
Admitted to medicine for evaluation of her pulmonary HTN and workup of the pulmonic stenosis.
# Pulmonary Valve Stenosis and Pulm Artery Mass: A TTE prior to admission showed severe supravalvular pulmonic stenosis suggestive of a compressed pulmonary artery.
Pt refused all closed MRI studies, even with premedication, due to fears of claustrophobia but pt agreed to a CT chest with contrast.
CT showed a 3.2 cm calcified mass in her main pulmonary artery.
The Diffdx included a calcified thrombus, metastatic renal cell carcinoma (likely from a new primary in her remaining kidney), myxoma, or sarcoma (though very rare).
Renal U/S showed no definite evidence of disease recurrence within the right nephrectomy bed, although this study was limited by pt's body habitus.
Cath revealed elevated right sided pressures (RV 113/13 mmHg) and normal pulmonary pressures (PA 26/19 mmHg) with a calculated pulmonary valve area of 0.29 cm and a gradient of 35.68 mmHg between the RV and the PA. Intravascular ultrasound showed a significant and large calcific plaque distal the pulmonary valve.
Based on this information, Thoracic Surgery was consulted and the patient was brought to the OR for surgery on [**10-8**] for both pulmonic valve replacement and pulm artery mass evaluation/excision.
Renal U/S ([**10-3**]): No evidence of mass in left kidney or R nephrectomy bed.
Medications on Admission: None  Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: pulmonary artery hypertension; mass in pulmonary artery   Discharge Condition: stable   Completed by:[**2118-1-7**
