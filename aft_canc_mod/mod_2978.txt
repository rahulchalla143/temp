She tolerated this well except for fairly severe hyperglycemia (to 400),which required one visit to the EW but no hospital admission.
She then began having watery diarrhea on [**9-28**].
She had a temp to 100.6 at home and had dry heaves, otherwise no other constitutional sx.
Pt transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to severe hypotension.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she continued to be hypotensive with SBP's of  90's and given 2L NS in 4 bnoluses with mild improvement and antihypertensives were held.
Since she was neutropenic with ANC of 450 with no obvious source of infection she was started on broad antibiotic coverage of ceftazidime, flagyl and gentamycin.
She remained afebrile, SBP improved to 90's to 120's overnight, and creatinine continued to trend down.
Past Medical History: 1.Metastatic colon cancer, dx [**2-7**], s/p LAR [**2-7**]  and rt.ureterolyisis and now enrolled in chemo protocol.

2 very supportive daughters.

Recent history of daughters with diarrhea was concerning for infectious etiology, although lack of abdominal cramping make toxin producing secretory diarrhea unlikely.
She remained afebrile with no elveated WBC now off antibiotics for 4 days.
Most likely cause was thought to be recent chemotherapy regimen of decadron, irinotecan, 5FU, leukovorin and avastin with most offensive [**Doctor Last Name 360**] in causing diarrhea being irinotecan and leukovorin.
We continued to treat diarrhea with octreotide, loperamide, kaolin/pectin and cholestyramine along with modified [**Last Name (un) **] diet.
Hypotension-Vigorous response of SBP to fluid resuscitation never requiring pressors made hypovolemia most likely cause in combination with her AS.
Pt was orthostatic with PT on [**10-10**], but this resolved with IV hydration with 1L NaBicarb and SBP remained >103.
ARF-Due to prerenal state with loss of intravascular volume through diarrhea now back to baseline.
Low GFR during hypovolemic state also may have caused hyperkalemia.
DM-Pt initially taken off her outpatient glyburide due to poor PO intake while in ICU.
Metastatic colon CA-Held off on irinotecan, 5FU, leukovorin and avastin due to diarrhea and informed pt that longterm chemotherapy plan would be discussed once her diarrhea resolved and she was discharged home.
FEN-Previous electroylte abnornalities were all consistent with diarrhea and hypovolemia including hypovolemic hyponatremia and loss of bicarb in diarrhea.
Hypercalcemia was due to continue Lasix use in prerenal state.
Glipizide 5mg daily, increased to 10mg daily after [**9-19**] when became hyperglycemic s/p decadron 6.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for back pain.
Loperamide HCl 2 mg Capsule Sig: Two (2) Capsule PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for diarrhea.
Disp:*4 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Diarrhea and dehydration   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable but diarrhea continued  Discharge Instructions: If you experience increasing diarrhea, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, inability to eat or keep up with fluid loss in diarrhea by drinking, you should call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] but if he is not available you should go back to the emergency room.
You should also continue taking the loperamide and kaopectate when you leave the hospital but only use it if diarrhea comes back.
You were also started on the antibiotic Levofloxacin for a urinary tract infection which you should take for the next four days as prescribed.
