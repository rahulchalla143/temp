HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 32611**] for laparoscopic excision of a known adrenal adenoma contributing to the patient's labile hypertensive state.
Surgery was referred as an MRI on [**2124-7-17**] demonstrated a right adrenal mass with fatty elements with recommendation from Radiology for biopsy.
Following the surgery, the patient's extubation was complicated by respiratory distress requiring re-intubation and admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the [**Hospital Ward Name **].
He was extubated without complications.
At the time of discharge, he had been afebrile times 24 hours.
The patient did, however, demonstrate some areas of blanching erythema on his port sites, on postoperative day three.
This was felt to be consistent with cellulitis.
The patient tolerated both, initially, a liquid diet and, ultimately tolerated a general house diet without nausea, vomiting or abdominal distention.
Patient was advised to not take any of his previous hypertension medications besides the newly described Lopressor due to the risk of severe hypotension.
