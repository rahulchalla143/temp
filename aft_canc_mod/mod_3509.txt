No head trauma.
No witnessed seizure activity.
He was noted to have a melena/BRBPR in ED, and pt reported that he had noted several episodes of melena for the last 5 days (unable to quantify exact amount and frequency).
Pt had EGD in ED which showed no evidence of active bleeding; portal gastropathy, esophageal varices, and small AVM in stomach were noted.
They report that he has had frequent loose BM (~10/day) for the last 10 days and reported mild nausea (although no significant vomiting) and bloating/abdominal distension.
In MICU, pt received the last 3 units of his total 9 units PRBCs, was a total of 12L positive so far over length of stay, had colonscopy that did not reveal a bleeding source though was notable for a diverticulum, polyps in the distal descending colon, angioectasias in the ascending colon, transverse colon and mid-descending colon (thermal therapy), grade 2 internal hemorrhoids.
Patient's hct remained stable after his initial presentation, though he continues to have melanotic stools.
Also of note, patient's mental status has waxed and waned over admission, worsened over the last night in the setting of receiving Ativan and Ambien.
Has had mild pain controlled with Tylenol, low dose given hepatic dysfunction.

2) Minimal degree of left lower lobe infiltration, unchanged.
No evidence of new infiltration or pulmonary congestion.
[**2199-3-17**]  CHEST, SINGLE AP FILM: History of GI bleed with wheezing.
There are low lung volumes.
Right subclavian CV line has tip located in region of cavoatrial junction.
Allowing for technique, heart size is within normal limits and there is no evidence for CHF.
ST-T wave abnormalities have normalized in leads V4-V6.
T wave inversions remain in leads V2-V3.
Interval development of a fair amount of fluid within the abdomen and pelvis, which measures Hounsfield units consistent with simple fluid or ascites.
Low attenuation hemoperitoneum is rarely seen on CT, but there is no sentinel clot sign as described above to indicate bleeding from solid organs.
Note that it is somewhat atypical for simple ascitic fluid to collect in the right anterior pararenal space and about the cecum and proximal ascending colon.
There is interval development of small bilateral pleural effusions.
[**2199-3-14**]  GI Bleeding study IMPRESSION: 1) No active bleeding within the bowel.
2) Findings to suggest the possibility of a hematoma within the right upper quadrant.
This is possibly a nonspecific finding in light of patient's recent chemo embolization.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 yoM with h/o esophgeal CA, variceal bleed, HCC s/p recent chemoembolization presents s/p syncopal episode w/BRBPR and melena.
Colonoscopy, bleeding scan, CT scan of abdomen and EGD did not reveal bleeding lesion though EGD showed varices that appeared to have bleed sometime recently.
He was continued on IV protonix [**Hospital1 **] and octreotide gtt initially, and an attempt was made at banding his varices though this was not successful secondary to an esoph stricture that limited passage of the banding device.
Wheezing: developed while in the MICU after fluid resuscitation, likely from lung compression by ascites + some element of cardiac asthma.
He responded well to lasix while in the unit, and was continued on Lasix 40mg po qd while on the floor with a goal -1L/day until he became volume contracted.
Hypotension: on admit, resolved with IVF, likely secondary to volume depletion in setting of GI bleed.
Coagulopathy: may be secondary to Vit K deficiency (given poor PO intake), decreased synthetic function given HCC and recent chemoembolization, massive transfusion of PRBC.
AG acidosis: on admit, likely secondary to increased lactate and prerenal ARF from hypoperfusion, resolved with IVF.
Altered mental status: developed while in the unit in the setting of Ativan, Ambien, Zyprexa given on one night.
It was felt unlikely to be from infection as his WBC count was normal, he had no fever, his UA was negative, his CXR clear, blood cx without growth.
Monitored closely for evidence of withdrawal with Ativan prn CIWA scale but no evid of withdrawal while in house.
Oncology: h/o esophageal cancer, hepatoma;  possible multiple pulmonary mets, spinal mets, ileum mets on recent CT (although atypical spread for both esophageal cancer and hepatoma).
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
)(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Blood loss anemia Hypovolemic shock GI bleed, likely esophageal variceal bleed Altered mental status Respiratory distress Acute renal failure Coagulopathy Acidosis, anion gap h/o etoh abuse Liver failure Portal hypertension   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, hct stable at ~30 after 10 units resuscitation, no further melena or BRBPR  Discharge Instructions: Please continue to take all medications as prescribed and to follow up with your doctors.
If you develop bleeding from your mouth or rectum, dark stools, lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms, go to the nearest Emergency Room for evaluation.
