History of Present Illness: Patient is a 70 Y M with Stage IV colon cancer and extensive portal vein thrombosis who presents from the ER with severe nausea and vomiting.
He began modified FOLFIRI on [**12-8**], and after he experienced severe nausea and vomiting.
Since that time, he has had continued nausea and non-bilious vomiting where he is barely able to keep down water.
He has also had full body shakes without fever or chills.
He notes inceased abdominal girth and a 6lb weight gain over the past week.
He notes difficulty urinating but no urinary incontinance or hematuria.
He has [**10-28**] pain in his abdomen that is worse with inspiration but decreases to [**1-28**] with PO morphine.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations, lower extremity edema.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezes.
Denies dysuria, stool or urine incontinence.
Denies rashes or skin breakdown.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  He presented in [**4-/2122**] with abdominal pain.
He had a cecal cancer with no evidence of metastatic disease by CT.  At the time of open colectomy, there was evidence of miliary studding and he underwent resection of at least one metastatic macroscopically visible omental nodule.
FOLFOX chemotherapy was begun in [**7-/2122**] because of symptomatic left lower quadrant pain related to disease progression.
A repeat CT after four courses showed slight progression.
He had restless legs that was felt to represent oxaliplatin toxicity and he was subsequently switched to short-term infusional 5-FU and leucovorin according to the De Gramont schedule in 07/[**2122**].
His last CT scan two weeks ago showed increasing ascites and the decision was made to discontinue 5-FU and leucovorin and proceed with FOLFIRI.
He received C1 D1 of modified folfiri on [**2123-12-8**].
Other Past Medical History: 1) Hypertension 2) Hyperlipidemia 3) Osteoarthritis 4) Extensive portal vein thrombosis extending up the right hepatic vein on Lovenox since [**2123-9-9**] 5) BPH 6) s/p tonsillectomy 7) s/p traumatic finger amputation of left hand at age 4 8) Nephrolithiasis  Social History: Lives with his wife.
No other family history of malignancy.

[**2123-12-13**] CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, there is no relevant change in extent of the known bilateral pleural effusions.
Minimal subsequent areas of atelectasis but no evidence of pneumonia.
Interval increase in the abdominal ascites since [**2123-11-29**].
Bilateral small pleural effusions, now larger.
Mild right hydronephrosis, but no obstructing stone seen.
[**2123-12-16**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Essentially unchanged left greater than right small pleural effusions.
[**2123-12-17**] LE DOPPLER U/S: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
No free air.
Small volume ascites.
Right pleural effusion.
[**2123-12-17**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Extensive new consolidation in the right lower lung on the current study subsequently improves.
This could represent the changes of acute aspiration rather than pneumonia resolving from it.
Left lower lobe atelectasis has improved.
No pneumothorax.
[**2123-12-18**] UE DOPPLER U/S: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
Probable subsegmental right middle lobe pulmonary embolus without evidence of heart strain.
No additional pulmonary emboli are identified, although this study is limited by respiratory motion artifact.
Small ground-glass opacities within the right upper lobe are likely infectious or inflammatory in etiology.
Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions slightly increased from [**2123-12-13**] CT. 4.
Large volume ascites as before.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
[**2123-12-19**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Mild to moderately severe consolidation in the right lower lobe has worsened compared to [**12-18**], not as severe as on [**12-17**].
The variability suggests atelectasis is largely responsible, and there is accompanying small right pleural effusion.
There is no evidence of free air either in the abdomen or pleural space.
Brief Hospital Course: 70yo man with Stage IV colon cancer and portal vein thrombosis on enoxaparin admitted for severe nausea, vomiting, and increased ascites.
He was transferred to the ICU [**2123-12-17**] for hypoxia and aspiration pneumonia.
# Nausea/vomiting: Due to chemotherapy.
KUB showed no obstruction.
- AVOID FOSAPREPITANT AND APREPITANT DUE TO HICCUPS.
# Febrile neutropenia: Due to 1st cycle FOLFIRI.
Started on vancomycin/cefepime and metronidazole in setting of low BPs and hypoxia worrisome for sepsis.
CXR and CT scan revealed RLL pneumonia suggesting aspiration.
# Aspiration RLL pneumonia and hypoxemic respiratory distress: Vancomycin stopped.
Positive beta glucan 93, unlikely significant given his clear clinical course with aspiration pneumonia and resolution with antibiotics.
- F/U cultures.
# Metastatic colon cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis: s/p modified FOLFIRI x1 cycle [**2123-12-8**].
Acites SAAG consistent with malignant ascites.
Cytology: Atypical cells highly suspicious for malignancy.
# Hiccups: Likely due to diaphragmatic irritation from peritoneal mets.
Avoided metoclopramide due to recent diarrhea.
Could also consider haloperidol or scheduling prochlorperazine.
- AVOID BENZODIAZEPINES.
# Sinus tachycardia: Due to infection, volume depletion, and small PE.
Hypotension and tachycardia with aspiration pneumonia.
# Diarrhea: Likely due to antibiotics.
# Port clot: Angio study and stripping of fibrin sheath done [**2123-12-16**].
# Urethral obstruction: Secondary to BPH and probably tumor/ascites.
# Portal vein thrombosis: SAAG not c/w portal HTN and CT did not show progression of clot burden.
# Pleural effusions and acute pulmonary edema: Given furosemide 20mg IV x1 in ICU.
# HTN: [**Last Name (un) **] (formulary substitution) stopped because of hypotension.
# Hypercholesterolemia: Stopped etezimibe and pravastatin based on family meeting agreement [**2123-12-22**].
# Pain (abdomen): Continued PRN morphine.
# Hypernatremia: Volume depleted due to diarrhea, recent N/V, and poor PO intake.
Stopped IV fluids with new dyspnea and pulmonary congestion.
Repleted hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia (worsened from diarrhea).
Metabolic acidosis also due to diarrhea, now resolved.
# DVT PPx: Enoxaparin for portal vein thrombosis and PE.
# Precautions: None.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7665**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Nausea with vomiting.
Metastatic colon cancer.
Aspiration pneumonia.
Pulmonary embolus (blood clot in lung).
Hypertension (high blood pressure).
Hypotension (low blood pressure).
Hypokalemia (low potassium level).
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for severe nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
The nausea/vomiting was a likely complication of your recent chemotherapy for metastatic lung cancer.
CT scan of the abdomen showed increased fluid in your abdomen (ascites) and you underwent a paracentesis (drainage of fluid from the abdomen).
Since you still had pain and fluid in the abdomen, you underwent a second paracentesis.
Nausea and vomiting worsened despite nausea medication and you then aspirated some vomit (going down the wind-pipe into the lungs) causing a severe pneumonia.
You had an episode of low blood pressure and were satrted on IV antibiotics.
Because your oxygen was dangerously low, you were transferred to the Intensive Care Unit and needed oxygen support for several days.
A CT scan of the chest showed a pulmonary embolus (blood clot in the lung) in addition to the pneumonia.
You also became temporarily delirious (confused) because of a dose of lorazepam (Ativan) given for nausea.
Lastly, you developed severe diarrhea, possibly from the antibiotics.
Tests for infection were negative.
After IV fluids, electrolyte replacement for low potassium and low phosphorous, and loperamide (Immodium), the diarrhea improved.
Viscous lidocaine/Maalox/diphenhydramine for mouth/throat pain as needed.
Baclofen 10 mg 3x a day as needed for hiccups.
Neutra-phos 3x a day for low phosphorous levels.
