He reports that he has had intermittent DOE for year but notice a sharp increase in his weight over a period of 10 days.
He also had a holter revealing afib (rate 40-100), nuclear stress ([**2163-11-1**])without ischemia and normal ECHO on [**2163-11-3**] (mild AS, mild MR).
Upon arrival to the ED he was found to be hypotensive with hyperkalemia and ARF (Cr ~4 from basline of 1.2)  He was sent to the floor, diuresed and then sent to the ICU after he was hypotensive requiring dopamine and vasopressin.
Swan numbers: RA: 25 RV: 55/20/10 PA: 55/25 PCW: 26 His L flank pain was evaluated with a CT Abdomen and he was found to have L nephrolithiasis and an exophytic cyst on the lower pole of the L kidney.
His pain has been controlled with narcotics.
He had also been recieving  Zyvox for presumed pneumonia and solumedrol 60 mg q6h for presumed COPD.
He does have decreased appetite, but has been active with outside hobbies including golf and curling.
The thoracics service was contact[**Name (NI) **] for this evaluation and it was suggested that the patient be admitted to the MICU given his underlying medical problems.

[**11-23**] Bronchial Washings:  Bronchial washing, left upper lobe:    NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Reactive bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar   macrophages.
ADDENDUM: Hematology slide 0559R of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was   reviewed and shows alveolar macrophages.
No evidence of   malignancy.
[**11-23**] CXR: FINDINGS: No pneumothorax.
There is complete opacification of the left lung, which is indicating collapse in the left upper lung, likely due to mucus plug.
There is a small right pleural effusion, unchanged.
There is no consolidation in the right lung.
There is no evidence of left-sided pneumothorax.
In the right lung, in the middle lobe, some subtle areas of atelectasis are seen.
No evidence of larger pleural effusions.
[**2163-11-24**] CXR: PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Compared to recent studies of [**2163-11-23**], there is improved aeration of the left upper lung, without evidence of new pneumothorax.
There persists opacification of the left perihilar and left lower lung, likely representing combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, although underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.
There is also improved aeration of the right lung although small right pleural effusion persists.
Since yesterday, diffuse opacification of the left lung is overall unchanged, mostly in the perihilar and left lower lung region, likely a combination of left pleural effusion and atelectasis, possibly consolidation.
Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
There is no other change.
Subcutaneous gas consistent with recent mediastinoscopy.
A small left lower paratracheal collection containing fluid and gas could represent post- procedural changes.
Correlation with recent procedure and clinical symptoms recommended.
Larger soft tissue density in the subcarinal region could represent lymphadenopathy or in the right clinical context could also represent a hematoma.
Status post left lower lobectomy with fibrotic changes and atelectasis noted in the left lung.
Fluid collection with thick enhancing rind in the left posterior sulcus is chronic and organized.
Recurrent tumor cannot be excluded.
Moderate right dependent pleural effusion with associated dependent atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
Left adrenal mass.
There is also suggestion of lymphadenopathy in the retroperitoneum that is incompletely imaged.
Small ascites noted along the dome of the liver.
Poor R wave progression, possibly related to lead placement.
No other abnormality.
No previous tracing available for comparison.

Immunoflourescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) (Final       [**2163-11-24**]):    NEGATIVE for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii)..   Brief Hospital Course: 76M initially admitted  to [**Hospital 1562**] hospital for CHF exacerbation, and then transferred ICU-to-ICU for workup of chronic mediastinal LAD.
Echo was performed which revealed severe diastolic dysfunction with ejection fraction of >70%.
While on the medical service, the patient was brought to the OR on [**2163-11-23**] for Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage  of the left upper lobe, cervical mediastinoscopy and bronchoscopy.
He was treated with Chest PT, IS and suctioning for the thought of possible mucus plugging.
As per documentation, the patient was doing well until the morning when he had increasing oxygen requirements and more labored breathing.
Serial chest x-rays showed eventual clearing of his left lung.
He underwent a chest CT which showed a large right pleural effusion and left airspace disease possibly consistent with pneumonia.
Though he did not spike a fever or develop a leukocytosis, he was started on empiric coverage for hospital acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn.
He was transferred from the ICU to the medicine floor on [**11-25**], where the below issues were addressed:  Hypoxia: Thought to be due to mucus plugging in setting of procedure.
Given the acuity of both the change and the reversal it is likely that he experienced lung collapse and then reaeration of expectorating mucus.
Received 4 days of vanc/zosyn for presumed HAP coverage in setting of hypoxia and increased sputum production, this was d/c'd [**11-28**] with no additional fevers and decreasing sputum.
During his stay, his oxygen requirement was weaned, now requiring 2L NC only intermittently.
Hypernatremia: Na as high as 150, did decrease with IVF but still mildly elevated on transfer to floor.
His mediastinal lymph node biopsy results were consistent with carcinoid.
The hematology/oncology service was consulted, and they recommended getting an octreotide scan, the preliminary read showed metastatic carcinoid.
diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: ECHO with EF of 75%, has severe dCHF.
Digoxin was discontinued in setting of diastolic CHF.
Added Metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**11-26**], though this was d/c'd [**11-27**] for episodes of bradycardia to 30s.
Also added Candesartan at low-dose (4mg, home dose 16 mg) given h/o diastolic CHF and goal of reducing afterload.
He did have some increased edema during his stay on the medical floor, and was given TEDs stockings and encouraged to ambulate.
The long-term goal remains to minimize diuretics, but use extreme caution with fluids as pt is exquisitely volume sensitive due to severity of dCHF.
Discharged with instructions to continue home lasix (40 mg) for 3 days with monitoring of daily weights and chemistries, this may need to be reassessed and monitored.
RHYTHM: He has chronic afib.
Diuresis minimized on the floor, received 40 mg IV lasix and 40mg PO lasix on two occasions with good diuresis, pt maintained blood pressures.
The goal continues to be to minimize diuresis to prevent excessive preload reduction.
CAD: He was continued on his statin, held ASA due to h/o GI bleed      Medications on Admission: PPI Lipitor 10 Atacand 16 (confirmed with spouse) Digoxin 0.125 mg qd Aldactone 25 qd Lasix 40 qd Allopurinol 100 mg qd Verapamil 180 qd Coumadin 2.5 (MWF); 1.25 (TTSS) Flomax 0.5   Discharge Medications: 1.
