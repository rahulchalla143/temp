[**Last Name (STitle) **] for neck swelling - [**2199-5-21**] thyroid/neck US: normal thyroid gland, multiple bilateral enlarged lymph nodes measuring 2.2 x 1.6 x 2.2cm at the largest.
- [**2199-6-3**] lymph node FNA: negative for malignancy and just showed necrotic debris and macrophages.
- [**2199-7-4**] left cervical lymph node excision that revealed a poorly differentiated carcinoma with osteoclast-like giant cells that was strongly immunoreactive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3/CAM 5.2, cytokeratin 7 and TTF-1.
Consistent with NSCLC.
- [**2199-7-23**] CT Torso: showed substantial lymphadenopathy present in the chest, specifically a 2.5 x 1.5 cm right upper paratracheal node, a right mediastinal 9 x 14 mm node, a prevascular node measuring 2.1 x 1.2 as well as bilateral hilar and subcarinal adenopathy.
He had a 1.6 x 1.2 cm right supraclavicular node as well as a left 1.5 cm x 9 mm supraclavicular node.
Within the lungs, there was irregular mass in the right upper lobe measuring 2.1 x 1.3 mm.
Bilateral severe emphysema, and bibasilar ground-glass opacities in the lower lobe described as fibrosis in the peripheral distribution.
Within the abdomen, the adrenals were unremarkable and in the pelvis there was no intraabdominal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
There is a T12 benign hemangioma, but no other bony disease.
- [**2199-8-5**] bone scan: no evidence of osseous metastatic disease.
- [**2199-8-5**] MRI brain: No intracranial metastases - [**2199-8-9**] CT torso for trial baseline: Unchanged from [**2199-7-23**].

The parietal lobe lesions raised concern for leptomeningeal disease.

Please note, edema in the setting of emphysema may also present in this manner.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 24529**] was a 62 year-old man with NSCLC stage IV with brain mets, completed WBRT [**2200-9-2**], who presented with severe headache and fever on [**10-21**] and transferred to the MICU on [**10-22**] due to worsening hypoxia and new b/l infiltrates.
The patient was ruled-out for tuberculosis.
Given hypoxia, fndings on imaging and an elevated BDG the working diagnosis was PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].
Given the severity of the patient's infectious process and the poor prognosis of his malignancy; goals of care were adressed and the patient was made DNR/DNI.
