HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of severe obstructive sleep apnea and coronary artery disease who was admitted on [**2131-5-23**], after a motor vehicle accident with a head laceration.
The patient endured seventh and eighth rib fractures on the left and a seventh rib fracture on the right and a loss of consciousness.
The patient was initially found to have a left pleural effusion in addition to some fluid surrounding his liver and was admitted to the surgical floor for observation.
During his admission an initial electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation that autoconverted to sinus rhythm.
This was his first episode of atrial fibrillation, according to history of the patient.
Electrophysiology was consulted and performed an echocardiogram which showed normal ejection fraction with evidence of diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary hypertension with severe left ventricular hypertrophy and 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.
The patient did have an increase in troponin levels but Cardiology felt this was secondary to cardiac contusion as opposed to acute coronary syndrome.
Chest x-ray at this time showed increased bilateral effusions.
A left thoracentesis was therefore performed with a white blood cell count of 278, red blood cell count of 8,667, protein of 2.7, LDH 160, consistent with a transudative process.
The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management of his respiratory distress as they were unable to wean him from the noninvasive ventilation in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.
Myeloproliferative disorder with white blood cell count of 12,000, hematocrit 36, platelet counts of 800, followed at [**Hospital3 328**] Cancer Institute.
Severe obstructive sleep apnea with sleep study performed at [**Hospital 4415**] advising nocturnal CPAP.
Coronary artery disease.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops were noted.
Extremities showed no signs of clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Urinalysis: Specific gravity 1.017, large amount of blood, negative nitrite, 100 protein, pH 5.0, negative leukocyte esterase, greater than 50 red blood cells, [**1-31**] white blood cells, no bacteria.
RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray from [**5-30**] showed decreased effusions, continued congestive heart failure with perihilar opacification and CT of the chest from [**5-23**] showed a large left pleural effusion with a small right pleural effusion, cardiac enlargement, left lower lobe atelectasis, increased opacity in the left upper lobe suspicious for contusion.
Patchy areas of ground glass opacity in the right upper lobe anteriorly.
Small irregularly shaped nodules 6 mm in right apex.
CT of the abdomen showed an enlarged spleen with a small perisplenic fluid collection and large gallstones in the gallbladder.
Respiratory failure:  The patient exhibited hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure of unclear etiology.
Hypoxic respiratory failure improved with diuresis.
The patient was diuresed with Lasix and Natrecor to a total of negative five liters which seemed to improve his congestive heart failure by chest x-ray and by physical examination and seemed to improve his hypoxic respiratory failure.
Many factors were considered to be at play in his hypercapnic respiratory failure including congestive heart failure from diastolic dysfunction causing large bilateral pleural effusions with some pulmonary edema, muscle weakness and likely obstructive sleep apnea with some central hypoventilation syndrome.
It is most likely that the patient's hypercapnia is due to his obstructive sleep apnea and, thus, treating the obstructive sleep apnea is the best way to address this problem.
The patient was at many times noted to be extremely somnolent and unresponsive, however, his somnolence did not correlate with his pCO2 levels, therefore, it was thought not to be due to hypercapnic toxicity but due to his obstructive sleep apnea and extremely large sleep deficit.
In addition, the patient was noted to have a metabolic alkalosis thought to be secondary to contraction alkalosis and he was given supplemental potassium chloride and three doses of acetazolamide in order to improve his metabolic alkalosis and, thereby, increase his drive to breathe.
In addition, the patient underwent bilateral thoracentesis which yielded 1400 cc of serosanguinous fluid from either side.
In addition, the patient was rate controlled on beta blockers in order to treat his diastolic dysfunction with the hopes of improving his respiratory status.
Cardiac:  The patient was initially found to be in atrial fibrillation on admission but self-converted to normal sinus rhythm.
Throughout his stay the patient did continue to have paroxysmal bursts of atrial fibrillation, some of which were thought by Cardiology consult to actually be supraventricular tachycardias.
The patient was continued on his Lopressor and the doses titrated up in order to maintain normal sinus rhythm and the patient did have decreased episodes of supraventricular tachycardia with no episodes of atrial fibrillation during the last few days of his Intensive Care Unit stay.
Cardiology consult was obtained and did not recommend anticoagulation for the patient's paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Ectopy:  The patient did have two episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia which resolved with increased beta blocker doses and did not recur during his hospital stay.
Diastolic dysfunction.
The patient had an ejection fraction of 60% with severe diastolic dysfunction which was treated with Lasix as needed and now that the patient is uvolemic is being treated with metoprolol for rate control.
Coronary artery disease:  The patient has three vessel coronary artery disease and an appointment for cardiac catheterization after discharge.
Infectious Disease:  The patient initially had a low grade temperature of 100 on [**6-2**].
The patient was treated with levofloxacin empirically for possible pneumonia which was discontinued on [**6-8**] as a repeat chest x-ray showed no signs of infectious infiltrate.
Hematology:  The patient had mild proliferative disorder and his complete blood count was followed throughout this hospital stay.
