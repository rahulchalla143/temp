Pertinent Results: [**4-25**] Noncontrast Head CT: CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.
When compared to the previous exam, there is an area of hypoattenuation involving the right basal ganglia, which is new concerning for subacute infarction.
There is a moderate amount of periventricular white matter hypoattenuation, predominantly seen in the frontal lobes, which appears stable when compared to the previous exam.
No new areas of hypoattenuation are seen.
Extensive atherosclerotic calcifications are seen within the cavernous portion of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
There is opacification of the left sphenoid sinus, which is unchanged when compared to the previous exam.
IMPRESSION: New area of hypoattenuation involving the right basal ganglia compared to the previous examination, concerning for acute infarct infarction.
[**4-25**] Brain MRI/A: FINDINGS: BRAIN MRI: The diffusion images demonstrate an area of slow diffusion in the right subinsular region and in the right frontal lobe extending to the corona radiata indicative of an acute right partial middle cerebral artery territorial infarct.
Moderate diffuse periventricular hyperintensities are seen indicative of small vessel disease.
There is no midline shift or hydrocephalus seen.
IMPRESSION: Acute partial right MCA infarct involving the right frontal lobe and subcortical region.
Chronic blood products in both cerebral hemispheres could be due to previous trauma, ischemia or amyloid angiopathy.
Distal right vertebral artery is not visualized which could be secondary to congenitally small vertebral artery.
Both middle cerebral arteries demonstrate normal flow signal in the M1 segment with diminished flow signal in the sylvian branches which could be technical in nature.
No definite occlusion of the MCA trunk is visualized.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of occlusion of the main MCA trunk is identified.
Diminished flow signal is seen in sylvian branches of both middle cerebral artery which could be technical in nature.
Tortuous intracranial arteries could indicate atherosclerotic disease.
[**4-26**] CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are new, small areas of hyperattenuation in the region of the right basal ganglia compatible with hemorrhage.
Surrounding low-attenuation region involving the right basal ganglia, subinsular region and right frontal lobe appears larger and more well- defined when compared to the previous exam.
This is consistent with evolution of the partial right middle cerebral artery infarct, demonstrated on the DWI study.
No extension of infarction is identified.
There is no significant mass effect, hydrocephalus, or shift of normally midline structures.
Moderate amount of periventricular white matter hypoattenuation is stable.
Also noted is apparent ectasia of the left vertebral and basilar arteries, and extensive intracranial vascular calcification.
New areas of hyperattenuation within the region of the right basal ganglia concerning for small ("petechial") hemorrhagic conversion in the region of infarction.
There is no significant mass effect or midline shift.

10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.. .
Pre-procedure timeout was performed to confirm patient identity and indication for examination.
Samples were sent for histological analysis.
Further samples were also sent for analysis as part of the renal SPORE project, to which the patient had given independent prior consent.
A cluster electrode was then inserted under CT fluoroscopic guidance and four applications of radiofrequency energy were applied to various parts of the renal tumor under CT fluoroscopic guidance.
After two applications of radiofrequency energy, an interval contrast-enhanced study was performed which showed 95% tumor necrosis with a clear apparent enhancing rim along the superolateral border of the neoplasm.
A final unenhanced examination showed no overt evidence of residual tumor, but did reveal some post- ablative gas formation and post-hydrodissection perirenal fluid.
No complications were apparent.
[**4-27**] Bedside Speech & Swallow Evaluation: HISTORY: 82 year old Bulgarian speaking woman admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2122-4-23**] with Dilated Cardiomyopathy.
She had a biopsy of a L Kidney mass c/b retroperitoneal bleeding.
She had a transfusion after dropping her HCT followed by a R CVA w/L weakness on [**2122-4-25**].
We were consulted to evaluate her oral and pharyngeal swallowing ability to r/o aspiration.
According to the interpreter, she does not slur her speech, but she sometimes underarticulates and/or runs out of voice/sound when trying to talk.

WBC RBC  Hgb  Hct  MCV  MCH  MCHC RDW Plt Ct [**2122-6-26**] 05:50AM    2.4* 3.64* 11.3* 32.9* 91 31.0 34.3 14.9 220 [**2122-6-26**] INR 2.3   Brief Hospital Course: Ms.  [**Known lastname 30132**] is an 83yo Bulgarian speaking female with a h/o PAF and RCC who was admitted for radioablation and ended up with a retroperitoneal bleed and a subsequent stroke.
1) Retroperitoneal bleed: The morning following admission, the patient was noted to have a drop in her hematocrit from 40 to 31.5; a repeat 6 hours later was 30.5.
CT abdomen [**4-23**] showed moderate amount of left perirenal, retroperitoneal, and pelvic hemorrhage.
Surgery evaluated pt, no operative intervention was required.
Her antihypertensives were also held in setting of tenuous volume status 2/2 blood loss, but were restarted without complication on [**4-27**].
2) Stroke: Patient has a history of a CVA in [**2102**] with residual R-sided weakness.
However, on HD #3, she was noted to have a new L sided facial droop.
A head CT showed a new area of hypoattenuation involving the right basal ganglia, concerning for acute infarct.
A MRI/MRA showed acute partial right MCA infarct involving the right frontal lobe and subcortical region with pooled blood, with no evidence of occlusion of MCA trunk.
Carotid U/S demonstrated no stenosis, and a repeat head CT on [**4-26**] demonstrated new areas of hyperattenuation within the region of the right basal ganglia concerning for small petechial hemorrhagic conversion in the region of infarction, but no significant mass effect or midline shift.
A follow up S&S study demonstrated improvement, and she was started on ground solids and thickened liquids with aspiration precautions.
3) Renal mass: Pathology consistent with renal cell carcinoma, probably chromophobe type.
There was thought to be no role for adjuvant therapy.
4) Respiratory difficulties: After her stroke, Ms. [**Known lastname 30132**] had a transient O2 requirement, and experienced several episodes of desaturations to the 70s while sitting in a chair.
She remained asymptomatic during these episodes, and they resolved spontaneously after lying back in bed.
They were thought to represent a shunt physiology from atelectasis secondary to kyphosis and residual weakness post-stroke.
A TTE with bubble study on [**5-28**] did not show any evidence of an anatomical shunt.
She was encouraged to use an incentive spirometer, though this was difficult because of language barriers and poor motivation from significant depression.
6) Hematuria: Pt also noted to have hematuria, rec'd bladder irrigation.
7) UTI: Found to have Proteus UTI on UA.
After full 7-day course, repeat UA consistent with UTI, urine culture grew MRSA and ESBL Klebsiella.
She occasionally experienced bradycardia during which her carvedilol was held temporarily.
10) Aortic aneurysm: Patient has known ascending aortic aneurysmal dilatation.
12) Depression: Ms. [**Known lastname 30132**] appeared to be depressed during her stay, and had little motivation to participate with PT or incentive spirometry.
This was tapered off and changed to Celexa for concern of causing leukopenia (WBC ~3).
She still requires help for all transfering.
