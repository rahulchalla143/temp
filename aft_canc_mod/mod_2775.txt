Admission Date:  [**2104-1-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2104-1-8**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5644**] Chief Complaint: fall  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: n/a   History of Present Illness: NF admit seen and appreciated.
Briefly this is a [**Age over 90 **] yo f w/ h/o lung ca w/ metastasis to brain on XRT, s/p fall at NH on Sun eve.
[**1-9**] lethargy, n/v,L arm weakness, sent to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] where she was noted to havv 3x3cm R posterior parietal bleed.
Past Medical History: Lung ca w/ mets to brain high cholesterol HTN CAD Lopresser 25mg tid  Social History: lives at [**Location **], at baseline walks w/ walker.
R pupil 4mm, no reactive, L pupil reactive.
no m/r/g LCA anteriorly.
Pertinent Results: cbc: 8.9  8.6  229     27.1  electrolytes: [**2104-1-2**] 04:51PM   SODIUM-137 [**2104-1-2**] 04:51PM   ALBUMIN-3.2* [**2104-1-2**] 09:45AM   SODIUM-131* POTASSIUM-4.1 CHLORIDE-95* TOTAL CO2-30* ANION GAP-10 [**2104-1-2**] 03:57AM   CALCIUM-8.6 PHOSPHATE-3.9 MAGNESIUM-1.8 [**2104-1-2**] 03:57AM   PHENYTOIN-10.2  MRI:On diffusion-weighted images there is a small area of restricted diffusion along the falx within the left occipitotemporal lobe.
It is also bright on FLAIR-weighted images and may represent a subacute infarct.
On gradient echo images there is a large area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right parietal lobe and left thalamus which following administration of gadolinium reveals ring-enhancing lesions.
These are suspicious for hemorrhagic metastases given the patient's history.
Additional ring-enhancing lesions throughout the supra- and infratentorial compartments are visualized.
There is a moderate amount of peritumoral edema involving the right parietal lobe lesion in addition to a second right parietal lesion along the falx high in the vertex.
The other areas of metastases reveal a minimal amount of peritumoral edema.
cxr: Cardiomegaly and mild CHF.
Please confirm resolution by repeated chest x-ray after treatment, and if the lesion persists, please evaluate by CT scan.
ct: Stable appearance of right parietal lobe and left thalamic hemorrhages, which are concerning for hemorrhagic metastasis in this patient with known metastatic lung carcinoma to the brain.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] yo f s/p INH in R parietal region, evidence of [**Hospital 58799**] transferred to medicine, w/ pupillary assymmetry but no evidence of neglect, responding to commands.
1) altered MS- likely bleed into metastatic lesion, although unclear based on location of known lesions, vs component of fall.
seems unlikely that pt will have dramatic cliical improvement given significant edema, mass lesions, and no NS intervention.
2) GIB- drop in hct during admission and + NGL.
Enteral nutrition and PPI (usually oral) have been shown to reduce the risk of ongoing bleeding.
-start TF's 10cc/h until nutrition recs -IV protonix (given recent h/o GIB) .
euvolemic on exam despite significant anasarca of hands/feet- minimal swelling of tibial surfaces so partially related to restraints.
5) ppx- ppi, pneumoboots .
