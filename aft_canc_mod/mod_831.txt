Admission Date:  [**2142-2-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-2-17**]   Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Augmentin / Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3376**] Chief Complaint: rectal cancer  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p lap Abdominal perineal resection with colostomy on [**2142-2-9**]   History of Present Illness: The patient is an 83-year-old man with a distal rectal cancer arising within 2 cm of the dentate line.
He also had large bilateral inguinal hernias which were repaired laparoscopically with the hope that he would proceed more quickly to radiation therapy.
His postoperative course was complicated by possible urine leak and urinary retention requiring self catheterization.
The patient did not recover well from the laparoscopic inguinal hernia repairs and the decision was made that full course radiation therapy would simply be too strenuous for the patient to tolerate.
A short course therapy would not allow for sufficient down-staging of the tumor to allow for distal anastomosis which would need to be a coloanal in an 83-year- old man anyway, so an abdominoperineal resection was recommended as definitive therapy with the best functional outcome.

Extrem: no c/c/e  Brief Hospital Course: 83yo gentleman with T3 rectal carcinoma transferred to the ICU after significant operative blood loss during lap [**3-28**].
He was admitted to the ICU following intraoperative blood loss with need for transfusion of 6 units of packed RBCs.
Patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of his volume resuscitation, and remained on mechanical ventilation post-op.
&#9658; ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING) -	Hct has been drifting down from 34 overnight, so unclear if bleed has truly stopped -	Follow Q4H Hct during day and transfuse for threshold of < 30 given extensive h/o CAD -	If bleed clearly stabilizes and pt has no evidence of cardiac ischemia, would consider decreasing transfusion threshold tomorrow -	No evidence of coagulopathy -	Maintain active T+S  # Respiratory failure: Pt not extubated after surgery out of concern for volume overload in setting of aggressive PRBC transfusions.
-	CXR with evidence of volume overload, RSBI marginal -	Will diurese today and follow respiratory status with serial ABGs -	RSBI in AM  # Hypotension: -	most likely due to propofol -	switch sedation to versed with boluses of fentanyl for pain control -	wean neosynephrine as tolerated  # Volume status: Patient very positive in setting of fluid and RBC resuscitation after surgery yesterday.
Evidence of fluid overload on CXR.
-	lasix for goal of negative 1-2L today -	possible that despite volume overload on CXR, patient is intravascularly dry.
Monitor hemodynamic status and urine output with lasix and reevaluate volume status in PM  &#9658; CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), COLORECTAL (COLON CANCER): -	s/p surgery [**2-9**] -	continue management with surgery/oncology  &#9658; DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II -	control with insulin gtt for goal blood sugar 80-120  &#9658; CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE) -	given h/o CAD, would check EKG and cardiac enzymes for evidence of myocardial ischemia secondary to significant bleed yesterday -	consider restarting ASA and plavix in afternoon if Hct stable  &#9658; OLIGURIA WITH .H/O PROSTATIC HYPERTROPHY, BENIGN (BPH) -	patient is oliguric, most likely from poor forward flow in setting of volume overload -	diuresis with lasix as above Foley in place; of note, patient chronically straight cath?????
