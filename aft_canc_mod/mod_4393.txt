No evidence of biliary duct obstruction, as questioned.
Gallbladder sludge, with no son[**Name (NI) 493**] features of acute cholecystitis.
Interval development of diffuse and symmetric perihilar ground glass opacities and septal thickening, most suggestive of diffuse pulmonary edema.
Pulmonary hemorrhage and diffuse infection are considered less likely given the symmetric findings.
Increase in size of a right pleural effusion, which is now large in size.
Minimal decrease in size of a left pleural effusion.
Diffuse osseous sclerosis, compatible with changes relating to myelodysplastic syndrome.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-11-9**], the degrees of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation along with pulmonary hypertension have all increased.
Increasing ascites and pelvic free fluid.
No evidence of intraperitoneal abscess, hematoma, colitis, or renal abnormality.
Increasing right pleural effusion, interstitial thickening within the lung parenchyma.
There is associated relaxation atelectasis.
Subtle peribronchovascular scattered ground-glass opacities in the right upper lobe, nonspecific, compatible with either infectious or inflammatory etiologies.
Unchanged small amount of bifrontal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
No new foci of hemorrhage identified, however portions of the brain are incompletely evaluated in the presence of motion artifact despite second attempt.
No evidence of parenchymal hemorrhage or intra- or extra-axial hematoma within limitation of motion degraded study.
Persistent opacification of mastoid air cells without osseous erosion.
Persistent mucosal thickening within paranasal sinuses.
-Head CT w/o contrast [**2167-11-24**]  1. small amount of bifrontal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
5 mm hyperdensity projecting over the right anterolateral temporal lobe likely represents a bone-related artifact 3.
Opacification of the mastoid air cells without osseous erosion, and possible fluid in the paranasal sinuses, new since the prior study.
Heterogeneous uterus with thickening of the endometrial stripe measuring up to 1 cm, concerning in a postmenopausal patient.
Moderate-to-large amount of free fluid is seen within the pelvis, similar to recent prior CT exam.
Bilateral pleural effusions consisting of simple or chylous fluid, with compressive atelectasis.
Trace intraperitoneal free fluid, but no retroperitoneal or flank hematomas.

- Liver or Gallbladder U/S w/ doppler of portal system ([**2167-11-10**]) 1.
Unchanged severe splenomegaly and small right pleural effusion.
- Renal U/S ([**2167-11-10**]) No evidence of vasoocclusive disease at both kidneys.
Echogenic lesion in the spleen, suggestive of a hemangioma.
Although the echogenic appearance would be somewhat atypical, a focal lesion associated with the patient's underlying disease process cannot be excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Noted anemic 5 years ago with polyps on colonoscopy but persisted and eventually deveoped severe pancytopenic and CT [**Last Name (un) 103**] showed splenomegaly - 1 BMBx equivocal second showed MDS.
Developed ARF felt likely ATN in the setting of hypotension and is on dialysis.
Persistent confusion since ICU likely multifactorial in nature which resolved by [**12-9**].
drug effect ?
She had no further fevers and antimicrobials rationalised [**12-4**].
Respiratory decompensation [**12-21**] and CT showed pulmonary edema and responded to aggressive diuresis with considerable improvement in fluid status.
She tolerated Busulfan well, but started to experience nausea and abdominal discomfort with Cytoxan.
She was transferred to the ICU for febrile neutropenia and hypoxic respiratory failure.
Solumedrol was continued, but bactrim (for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]) was held secondary to profound neutropenia.
In he ICU, the patient had a baseline anemia [**3-10**] BM suppression s/p transplant, but developed a falling hct and a small amount of vaginal bleeding in the context of low platelets (plts 7).
No evidence of RP or thigh bleed was found on physical exam.
Platelets remained low in spite of platelet transfusions, presumably secondary to the patient's splenomegaly.
It was decided that she would be transfused plts only before procedures or in setting of active bleeding and transfusion goal was latterly set to aim for a HCt>20 and Plt>10 to reduce the transfusion burden due to high requirement of transfusions and lack of symptoms at this level.
She remained on meropenem, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and micafungin until she was no longer neutropenic.
Thrombocytopenia was noted to be refractory to platelets, which were then only given when pt was showing signs of bleeding.
After transfer to BMT floor from MICU, patient was more responsive to platelets although this was again an issue by [**12/2167**] with little increase in her counts despite transfusions and having difficulty even attaining a platelet count of 20.
Changed cipro to cefepime [**12-8**] due to possible drug effect causing pancytopenia.
#Febrile Neutropenia: Patient was neutropenic during admission, and became febrile.
Initially was started on vancomycin, cefepime and micafungin, but she continued to have fevers and developed a cough that continued to worsen.
CT scan on [**10-31**] and [**11-4**] showed no evidence of infiltrate.
Pt triggered several times for tachycardia and tachypnea related to fever and was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.
The patient's neutropenia persisted throughout her ICU stay, but her ANC rose to 494 before she left the ICU.
#Hypoxemic Respiratory failure requiring ICU transfer: In the ICU the patient developed hypoxemic respiratory failure, initially secondary to volume overload with flash pulmonary edema in the context of a PRBC transfusion.
This was all likely complicated by a probable pneumonia (viral, bacterial or fungal).
The patient was given mucinex prn for cough.
After starting HD, the patient's fluid balance became positive and she continues to respond poorly to lasix.
Her resp status nevertheless continues to be good and she remained clinically stable in this regard on RA until her episode of decompensated pulmonary edema on [**12-21**] (see note on pulmonary edema for details).
Pt developed acutely worsening renal function after intubation and the cause was felt to be ATN secondary to hypoperfusion during an episode of hypotension during intubation.
She developed worsening hypervolemia, hyperkalemia up to 6.3 and a Creatinine level of 4.1 in spite of intravenous fluids and treatment for hyperkalemia.
While on the floor, she was dialysed with HD as needed for fluid removal and for uremia when renal function did not significantly improve.
Patient was noted to have altered mental status likely [**3-10**] uremia as this improved after dialysis sessions.
She had bilateral effusions and R effusion worse on CT [**12-21**].
Fluid status improved but she still had gross pitting edema to knees bilaterally.
After an episode of acute pulmonary edema, she as aggressively diuresed from [**12-21**] onwards with 80-100mg IV furosemide and her fluid status greatly improved.
# Confusion: This was considered likely multifactorial given a high Bili which improved, a high BUN on dialysis and the possibility of infection.
# Subarachnoid hemorrhage: Traumatic SAH following fall out of bed on [**11-24**] in the context of considerable thrombocytopenia and CT-head showed small bifrtontal SAH with no itraparenchymal element.
Stable on rpt Head CT. She was seen by the neurosurgery service who recommended rescanning only if she had a change in neuro exam and recommended transfusing platelets.
She was rescanned on [**11-27**] for concern for worsening altered mental status and bleed was unchanged.
A mild anisocoria was noted with the left pupil very marginally larger than the right.
On [**11-24**] overnight, fell out of bed and head CT showed bifrontal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
# Pancytopenia: ?
cause ?
drug effect ?
Stopped potential incriminating meds.
Investigated DAT -ve , HIT Ab pending, hapto normal, LDH normal Smear -ve for schistocytes.
#GVHD: Rash was present on back resolved.
She initially had diarrhea initially which resolved.
Likely the elevation was secondary to a medication effect vs GVHD.
Abdominal U/S found no biliary/gallbladder pathology.
On her arrival in the ICU, the patient was treated with Voriconazole in the context of neutropenia and a possible pneumonia.
This was stopped because of possible hepatotoxicity and micafungin was used instead.
but gradual over last 3 days - CT showed pulmonary edema and aggressively diuresed total 100mg IV furosemide [**12-21**].
Further 100mg IV furosemide [**12-22**] and [**12-23**] to good effect and symptomatic improvement.
Isosorbide dinitrate 10mg tid started [**12-24**] for decreasing afterload.
If decompensates for further furosemide and trial of CPAP +/- nitro IV infusion.
cause ?
reactive (asthma) ?
secondary to fluid overload ?
Pertussis -ve and CT-chest showed some change in GGOs which have migrated.
Pulm consulteda dn felt wide differential.
F/U CT-Chest [**12-14**] - centrilobular GGO in LUL suspicious for opportunistic infection - pulmonolary unimpressed and no current need for bronch.
ID reviewed [**12-19**] and concerned re increased SOB although not diuresed in past 2 days and found to have florid pulmonary edema by [**12-21**].
GVHD ?
CT- [**Last Name (un) 103**]/pelvis without contrast [**12-17**] showed showed worsening ascites since prev film, no free air, fluid collection or abscess, no thickened bowel to suggest colitis (although no oral contrast) and no renal abnormalities or evidence of hematoma.
Antibiotics chaged to IV cefepime and metronidazoel (possible concern for c difficile given increased stool output) [**12-17**] and negative.
# CMV reactivation: CMV VL 1070.
Given concerns for CMV with no other organ focus, seen by ophthalmology and evidence of retinal hemorrhage in supero-temporal field close to disc no evidence of CMV retinitis.
# Vaginal bleeding: Noted to passing blood with clots through vagina while in ICU stay in the setting of low platelets.
She was evaluated by the Gyn service who recommended vaginal u/s that showed thickened endometrial stripe concerning for endometrial neoplasm or other pathology.

Secondary: Pulmonary edema Pneumonia Respiratory failure require intubation Acute renal failure requiring dialysis Rash, Granft versus host disease CMV infection treated with gancycolvir  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Over the course of your transplant stay, you experienced some fevers and cough for which you received antiobiotics given that your white blood cell count was very low.
You also received blood and platelets given your low red blood cell and low platelet counts.
Your course was complicated pulmonary edema and acute kidney injury for which you required transfer to the ICU.
You required intubated for respiratory failure in the setting of pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs) and possible pneumonia.
You also had  fluid removed with dialysis given your acute kidney injury.
You received supportive care and medications were given to help remove the excess fluid from your body in addition to dialysis.
You symptoms improved, dialysis was able to be stopped and you were able to be transferred out of the ICU and back to the regular bone marrow transplant floor.
You also had a fall out of your bed; CT scan was performed at that time which should a small amount of bleeding in your head.
You were monitored and your symptoms improved.
You also had a rash and abdominal pain concerning for rejection which improved with immunosuppressive medicatin.
You were seen by gynecology and ultra sound showed thickened endometrial stripe that will need further gynecologic follow-up as an outpatient in the future.
