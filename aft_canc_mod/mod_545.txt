Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed no obstructive coronary artery disease.
The RCA had no angiographically apparent stenoses.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic arterial hypertension with a central aortic pressure of 178/74 mm Hg.
[**2155-10-27**] Carotid Ultrasound No plaque or hemodynamically significant stenoses.
1 cm pseudoaneurysm arising from the right common femoral artery.
No AV fistula identified.
[**2155-10-28**] ECHO PREBYPASS No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**1-10**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
No AI is visualized but echo windows are limited.

A carotid duplex ultrasound was performed which showed no significant internal carotid artery stenosis.
As she had a large hematoma from her cardiac catheterization, and ultrasound was performed which showed 1 cm pseudoaneurysm arising from the right common femoral artery, no AV fistula identified and a widely patent right femoral artery and common femoral vein.
