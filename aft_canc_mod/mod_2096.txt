Admission Date:  [**2196-8-15**]     Discharge Date:  [**2196-8-24**]  Date of Birth:   [**2146-12-16**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Oncology Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 49-year-old man with a history of systemic and CNS lymphoma, who was transferred from [**Hospital1 41211**] Hospital after he experienced a prolonged seizure tonic-clonic lasting approximately one hour.
According to his family, patient was doing well at home until yesterday despite a recent Clostridium difficile and Port-A-Cath infection.
One day prior to admission, he had seemed more tired than usual, although he had no specific complaints.
The next hour during the ambulance ride and arrival at the outside hospital, the patient continued to have seizure on and off.
His family denies any recent doses or any change in his doses.
CNS lymphoma status post XRT and intrathecal chemotherapy complicated by meningitis requiring shunt removal.
Seizure disorder status post left frontal craniotomy with residual left frontal lymphoma.
Recent Port-A-Cath infection.
He moved his left arm and leg spontaneously, but no verbal output.
Neck was supple without carotid bruits.
He did not have verbal output at all.
Cranial nerves II through XII:  Discs were not well visualized, with difficulty dolling eyes to the left.
He had pendular nystagmus and a right facial droop.
A head CT showed small areas of hyperintensity in the left frontal lobe, which is likely consistent with residual lymphoma.
No evidence of a new hemorrhage or mass effect.
An EEG was obtained, which showed nearly persistent polymorphic theta frequency slowing seen over the left frontal and temporal lobes.
The entire record was of low amplitude.
There was no epileptiform features and no electrocardiographic seizures are recorded, thought to be consistent with a post-ictal state after prolonged seizure.
It was consistent with encephalopathy.
Multifocal isolated sharp waves seen on the right parasagittal, central, and posterior regions.
There was extensive white matter disease in the left frontal greater than the right frontal, but study showed no evidence of a brain abscess and abnormalities did not change significantly since the prior examination.
Sepsis workup was undertaken with the LP negative for acute infectious process.
The Flagyl, which the patient had been started on for Clostridium difficile was changed to vancomycin given the concern for a decrease seizure threshold with the metronidazole.
The patient had a video swallow study.
He continued to experience difficulty with word finding.
At that time, the patient seemed comfortable with no signs of seizure activity.
On the [**2196-8-21**], the patient was noted to have some global seizure activity in the right upper extremity and left upper extremity.
He remained seizure free throughout the rest of the hospital course, and his mental status continued to improve.
His right sided weakness also resolved.
Patient had a tremor, which was thought to be secondary to high levels of valproic acid.
(2) Metastatic CNS lymphoma:  Due to the MRI and CSF profile provided evidence for disease progression, a staging CT of the torso was done, which showed the patient had a right sided pulmonary embolism.
(3) Pulmonary embolism:  Patient had a pulmonary embolism diagnosed on [**8-19**] on a staging CT.
However, this was thought to be a pulmonary embolism and the patient was recommended to be on life-long anticoagulation.
(4) Hyponatremia:  Patient experienced hyponatremia in the Neuro ICU, question of whether this was related to fluid depletion versus CNS hyponatremia.
The patient has cutaneous manifestations of his lymphoma with red blotchy areas on his back, right pelvis, and arm, which seem to come and go.
The rash was watched closely given the concern for Lamictal toxicity.
The patient showed no signs of this toxicity while in the hospital.
The patient was maintained on H2 blocker and pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.
