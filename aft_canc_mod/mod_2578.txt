Admission Date:  [**2157-4-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2157-7-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2123-3-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: fever, cough  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1. brain biopsy 2.
[**1-27**] level SMA embolization with 2 wires and particles for UGI bleed into distal duodenum/prox jejunum   History of Present Illness: DIAGNOSIS:  33-year-old gentleman with relapsed transformed B cell lymphoma status post autologous stem cell transplant on [**2155-3-31**], with disease recurrence in 07/[**2155**].
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  The patient initially presented in [**Month (only) 404**] of [**2151**] while in [**State **] with an episode of bloody diarrhea, preceded by syncope.
He was taken to a local emergency room and was evaluated with EGD and colonoscopy which did not reveal a clear source of the bleeding and no biopsies were taken.
A slight bulge in the gastric curvature was noted, however, suggesting a possible intra-abdominal mass.
This was performed in [**1-/2154**] at the [**Hospital1 18**] and revealed a healed linear erosion on the distal esophagus suggestive of a healed [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear.
Recommendations at that time were for no further followup and to discontinue his proton pump inhibitor.
In [**4-/2154**], he presented with flu-like symptoms and night sweats.
He also noted decreased appetite and a sensation of bloating and fullness in his abdomen.
He reported a five to six-pound weight loss over 1 month and noted a lump in his left abdomen and dull pain in his lower back.
A CT of the abdomen and pelvis at that time showed a 15 x 14.6 x 10.7 cm mass involving the left upper quadrant contigous with the pancreas and pressing on the duodenum as well as encasing the SMV, although all the vessels were patent.
A biopsy later revealed follicular lymphoma Grade II/III, follicular and diffuse with focal progression to follicular lymphoma Grade III/III.
The nodular architecture was effaced by vaguely nodular proliferation of small cleaved cells with a mass of larger centroblastic cells (10 to 15 per high power field).
Focally, the follicles were composed of sheaths of larger centroblastic cells consistent with transformation to a high- grade lymphoma.
He had a significant residual abdominal mass but a PET scan became negative and was then under observation.
In [**12-27**], he was noted to have a rising LDH and underwent a repeat PET scan which showed uptake in the mediastinum, abdomen, and bright uptake in the right inguinal region.
Given the patient's transformed phenotype, he was treated with cytoreduction and MIME chemotherapy followed by consolidation with high dose chemotherapy and stem cell rescue.
He tolerated this well and demonstrated evidence of response as determined by decrease in the size of mediastinal lesion and decrease in the intensity of PET uptake.
The patient subsequently underwent high-dose cytoxan for stem cell mobilization.
The patient's transplant course was complicated by development of pericarditis and pleural effusions of unclear etiology.
In [**2155-9-24**], he underwent repeat scans which showed some new adenopathy in the groin and increased uptake in the area as well as around the large left upper quadrant lesion which has been stable.
He had repeat CAT scans done in [**2156-3-25**] which showed ongoing growth of his lymphoma particularly in the lesion in the pelvic area.
A CT scan on [**2156-6-9**] which showed that his disease was stable.
Mr. [**Known lastname 38598**] was recently admitted on [**2157-3-25**] with an upper respiratory infection manifested by coryza, cough, and nasal congestion with fevers to 101 and also associated with a diffuse macular body rash.
He was just discharged on [**2157-4-1**] but called us today with a fever up to 101.5 and worsened dry throat, and loss of voice.
He denies diarrhea or abdominal pain and says his pruritis is improved from previous.
Social History: No tob, etoh, IVDA, tattoos+ transfusions  Family History: no cancer  Physical Exam: VITALS:  Temp 101.2  pulse 90's GEN: 34-year-old male, no acute distress.
SKIN: HEART: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no crackles or wheezes ABDOMEN: Soft, non-tender, normoactive bowel sounds, firm liver edge 2 cm below costal margin.
SKIN: diffuse jaundice NEURO: a&ox3, cn II-XII intact, diffuse muscular atrophy secondary to deconditioning related to prolonged hospitalization, symmetric strength, normal sensation, normal coordination, normal language and comprehension, normal affect.
RUQ U/S: The liver is normal in echo texture and architecture, without focal masses.
Chest CT: Assessment of the lungs demonstrates mild diffuse peribronchial wall thickening, best appreciated in the lower lobes bilaterally, greater on the right side.
MRI Abd: 1) No enhancing lesions identified in the liver.
2) No evidence for hepatosplenic candidiasis.
3) No intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Moderate hepatocellular and canalicular cholestasis.
No significant portal or lobular inflammation.
Focal hepatocyte apoptosis and ballooning degeneration.
No viral cytopathic changes immunoreactivity for herpes simplex virus (HSV)-I, HSV-II, or cytomegalovirus (CMV) seen.
No micro-organisms seen on AFB, GMS, or PAS-D stains.
Note:  There is one focally damaged bile ducts with no associated inflammation.
This could represent treated graft versus host disease.
MRI Head Signal abnormalities involving left medial temporal lobe and left basal ganglia region.
Subtle increased signal is seen in the region of left basal ganglia, which could be due to subtle enhancement or prominence of the vascular structures.
The differential diagnosis given the patient's clinical history is suggestive of infection versus neoplasm.
The appearances are more likely to be due to an infectious process.

1) Liver: Given pt's elevated LFTs, a RUQ ultrasound was performed in the ED, which was normal.
An MRI of the abdomen was done and this also was negative for biliary obstruction and hepatic infection.
Liver enzymes trended upwards despite increasing immunosuppression and adding Tacrolimus, so on hospital day #3, the liver team was again consulted.
The decision was made to re-biopsy which revealed a pattern consistent with GVH but also larger neutrophilic infiltrates concerning for infection.
On [**4-21**], patient was changed back to solumedrol (increased dose as well), w/subsequent decrease in bilirubin (hepatic enzymes stable).
Photopheresis was postponed during periods of his GI bleeding (see below).
2) Upper GI bleed: On [**4-26**] pt began to have melanotic stools.
He remained hemodynamically stable and EGD showed diffuse ulceration and [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear but no active source that could be intervented upon during the scope.
However, after a few days he continued to have melanotic stools and repeat EGD had pathology concerning for CMV.
He was resuscitated and again transferred to the unit and was scoped again with similar results but still no active arterial bleed seen.
Biopsy results from the first EGD came back positive for HSV and he was started on high dose foscarnet to treat for both HSV and CMV.
He again had BRBPR on [**5-21**] and again was scoped which did not reveal an arterial source.
He subsequently had a couple of episodes of melena which were thought to be clearance of remaining blood.
His stay on the [**Month/Day (4) 3242**] service was brief, as the day after transfer he had one episode of maroon liquid stool in the morning, and another episode later that night, prompting transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name 12837**] for repeat angiography (the angio on the East was flooded).
Repeat angiography on [**5-26**] demonstrated active bleeding in the region of the ligament of Treitz or proximal jejunum.
It was decided to attempt endoscopic hemostasis, therefore he underwent EGD on [**5-27**] which demonstrated active bleeding at D2-D3.
Ultimately became guaiac negative.
3) Fever/malaise: The theory of a upper respiratory infection in the setting of acute GVH was continued from the previous admission.
Pt ruled out for flu, adeno, parainfluenza and RSV.
ID was consulted and recommended ruling out other viral infections such as hepatitis, acute HIV, adenovirus, CMV.
However, intra-GI tract pathology was c/w HSV and possible CMV infection and the pt was treated with Foscarnet at high doses for over 3 weeks.
On discussion with ID foscarnet was discontinued with the plan to restart if symptoms returned.
Serial viral cultures from oral lesions grew HSV, and acyclovir-sensitivity tests were sent out, and the results are pending.
4) Dry Eyes: Initially, there was concern for adenovirus conjunctivitis with corneal ulcers causing pain so opthalmology was consulted.
On examination of the eyes, no ulcers or evidence of infection was found and they believed the dry eyes to be a consequence of GVH.
They recommended artifical tears and ointment for symptomatic relief.
A viral swab of the eye was negative for viral infection.
5) Oral thrush: On admission, pt was found to have white plaques on his soft palate.
These were swabbed and grew budding yeast and was positive for HSV.
Also, given the positive HSV swab, famvir was increased to the treatment dose of 500mg tid.
Despite this dosing pt continued to have sublingual lesions which were culture positive for HSV.
He improved symptomatically, but on [**5-13**] began to have more lesions c/w thrush and was started on ambisome as well as continuing with the nystatin swish and swallow.
6) Cough: Given pt's worsening cough, a chest CT was done which revealed mild peribronchial wall thickening which may be [**1-26**] bronchiolitis.
ID recommended ruling out mycoplasma with IgM and IgG; these both were negative.
Pulmonary was consulted to evaluate whether this was a viral bronchitis vs a GVH bronchiolitis.
They recommended obtaining PFTs and using Advair for symptomatic relief.
When it was low to 125 it was considered likely [**1-26**] pseudohyponatremia from elevated cholesterol (cholestasis in GVH producing lipoprot).
Stable w/o IVF or fluid restriction and as liver improved hyponatremia also improved to some extent.
8) Line infection: Pt had an episode of hypotension to 80/50 on [**4-17**], responded to 500cc NS bolus x2, and 20mg solumedrol.
Given h/o coag neg staph positive from line that was sensitive to vanco he was started on vancomycin.
Concern for infectious vs adrenal insuff and failure of prednisone to be converted by liver (on solumedrol until [**4-15**]).
Following this incident pt maintained his BP's and his line grew out coag neg staph, sensitive to vanco.
Pt was treated with zosyn empirically for a 14 day course, and symptoms improved.
There was some concern that his previously imaged mesenteric mass had spread to cause his persistent GI bleeding, however a CT scan done on [**6-2**] actually showed a decrease in size of his mesenteric mass.
11) FEN: During the course of his GI bleeds, and with his severe thrush and esophagitis, the patient was not taking in adequate PO, therefore he was started on TPN.
Once it appeared that his GI bleeding was stable, the TPN was cycled, and he was encouraged to begin eating again.
Initially felt headaches were secondary to the med, however got CT sinus to make sure there was no worsening of his sinusitis.
MRI of the head was done which demonstarted a well demarcated enhancing lesion in the left medial temporal lobe and left basal ganglia.
At this time he had no other significant neurological complaints.
There was concern for infectious cause vs lymphoma.
He was empirically started on ambisome for fungal infection and bactrim for toxoplasmosis.
LP was done and found no evidence of toxoplasma in the CSF.
A stereotactic brain biopsy was performed to determine whether the brain lesions represented toxoplasma infection vs. post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD).
The biopsies show a mixed-cell infiltrate both within brain and more prominently around vessels.
The infiltrate contains small lymphocytes, some atypical cells, plasma cells, a few eosinophils, an occasional neutrophil, and in some sections many macrophages.
The atypical cells include those that are flattened or worm-like and those with some nuclear convolutions.
The process's angiocentric proclivity has induced an obliterative small vessel vasculitis, including reactive and denuded endothelial cells.
Within the infiltrate and in brain parenchyma, another subpopulation of atypical nuclei appear enlarged, have glassy chromatin, and have a distinct but eosinophilic nucleolus or nuclear inclusion.
No Toxoplasma gondii parasites are identified, nor does the biopsy have the background usually associated with this infection.
Immunoperoxidase studies show much of the increased intraparenchymal cellularity immunoreacts with the T-lymphocyte antibody CD3.
These results do not support a diagnosis of lymphoma.
These findings together suggest that the patient's lesions result from a chronic encephalitis having a significant vasculopathic component.
The differential diagnoses include: post-transplant immunosuppression-related vasculitis, a viral-induced vasculopathy and encephalitis (e.g.
Varicella-Zoster vasculopathy or some reported cases of HHV-6), and possibly a biopsy near a site of principle pathology.
