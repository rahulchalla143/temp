Admission Date:  [**2193-12-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2193-12-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2124-6-16**]             Sex:   F  Service: OBSTETRICS/GYNECOLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6743**] Chief Complaint: ovarian cancer  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Debulking surgery including colectomy with end ileostomy, cholecystectomy, R oopherectomy, placement of bilateral J-P drains, placement of GJ tube.
History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known lastname 77072**] is a 69 year old woman with advanced ovarian cancer who underwent debulking surgery today.
The uterus and ovaries could not be removed because of tumor encasing the uterus, ovaries, and bladder; there was large omental caking; and thus, significant amounts of tumor had to be left in the abdomen.
There were no major complications of the surgery, but given the extent of the surgery and the possibility of post-operative difficulties, the ob/gyn and general surgery services (both working on the case) agreed that she would be best cared for in an intensive care unit tonight.
Over the last six months, Ms [**Known lastname 77072**] has lost approximately 20 pounds, and has had a number of exacerbations of her anxiety, increased vegetative symptoms, and a significant fear of falling; she was admitted to the [**Hospital3 2568**] psychiatric unit from [**Date range (1) 77073**] for these symptoms.
She was noted to have a distended abdomen; a CT revealed omental cake, adnexal masses, and massive ascites.
Colonoscopy revealed strictures, and a barium enema confirmed them; peritoneal cytology revealed malignant cells consistent with ovarian cancer.
She is complaining of pain in the lower abdomen as well as her chronic lower back pain (for which she uses a fentanyl patch as an outpatient).
She denies any discomfort or pain other than these three problems.
Specifically, she denies any difficulty with breathing or chest pain or dyspnea.
Family History: Patient reports her mother had "liver cancer" in her 80s; no other history of malignancy.

# Intraoperative course:  On [**2193-12-7**] the pt underwent exam under anesthesia, exploratory laparotomy, right salpingo-oophorectomy, and drainage of 4 liters ascites by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2028**].
She developed hypotension intraoperatively and was transfused 2 units of packed RBCs.
Intraoperative findings were significant for studding of all peritoneal surfaces, a solid cake of tumor from the top of the bladder back to the sacral promontory with indistinct tissue plains, tumor infiltration into retroperitoneal spaces, tumor compression of ileocecal portion of the bowel, complete replacement of the infracolic omentum with 15 cm tumor, tumor extension along the infragastric omentum and lesser sac, studding of diaphragmatic surfaces bilaterally.
Cardiovascular: Pt developed fluid responsive hypotension on POD#0, due to post-operative fluid shifts and medication effects of the epidural.
She voided without difficulty during the day, but experienced urinary incontinence thoughout that night.
Hematocrit fluxes were most consistent with fluid shifts; she did not appear to have major post-operative blood loss.
Neuro: Post-operative pain was initially managed with an epidural, but the epidural fell out and a fentanyl PCA was started for control of pain.
She was transitioned to dilaudid pca, then dilaudid po with adequate pain control.
# Infectious disease.
Surgery recommended 4 days ceftazidime and flagyl for ppx against intrabdominal infection.
Pt had 2 isolated low grade fevers.
Work ups were negative for infection.
These temperatures were attributed to atelectasis and insentive spirometry and ambulation were encouraged.
During MICU course the patient had some delirium and confusion.
Per their recs, we obtained MRI head, which was read as no metastatic disease; TSH, folate, B12; and discontinued her ativan, imipramine and prochlorperazine, while adding olanzapine for nausea and anxiety.
# HEENT.
Ovarian Ca, s/p debulking.
Pt will follow up as outpt with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2244**] for discussion of chemotherapeutic options.
