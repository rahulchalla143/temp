Lungs are clear, no pleural effusions, or PTX.
No acute cardiopulmonary process.

Active Diagnoses: # Respiratory Distress: On admission, the patient endorses a subjective sense of SOB, but O2 sat is 100% RA and respiratory rate is normal.
This revealed minimal supraglottic edema and erythema that could likely represent early post-radiation changes versus reflux.
There was also minimal paradoxical motion of his vocal cords that may contribute to dyspnea.
# Dysphagia/Odynophagia: Likely esophagitis/mucositis related to radiation therapy effect, as the timing coincides and this is a known side effect.
Patient endorses pain upon swallowing and frequently becomes dehydrated secondary to poor PO intake from odynophagia.
On admission, he BUN was slightly elevated which may be sign of hypovolemia.
He was given several liquid pain relief agents.
# Esophagitis:  Patient has no recollection of being on Protonix, but recent EGD for placement of PEG noted moderate to severe esophagitis and recommended [**Hospital1 **] PPI.
He received 1 unit pRBCs on [**7-24**] for sxs of fatigue with bump from 26.8 to 33.0.
His hct trended down to 28 by discharge, but this was not felt to be significant enough of a decrease to treat.
# Leukopenia.
He likely has chemo-induced leukopenia.
He was monitored for fever and signs of infection.
Status post DES to RCA after unstable angina [**2158-1-16**] (3 Xience DES placed to RCA).
Recath with diffuse and severe CAD and left main and LAD/LCX disease leading to CABG [**2158-1-12**] in [**State 38104**] (LIMA to LAD, RIMA to ramus, RSVG to D1, RSVG sequentially to OM3 and PDA).
He reported no chest pain.
# HTN.
The patient was hypertensive on admission (152/60).
# Invasive Squamous Cell Carcinoma.

You were admitted because you had shortness of breath.
ENT doctors examined [**Name5 (PTitle) **] as well and determined that your symptoms are likely due to some mild swelling from the radiation therapy.
Your pain was well controlled with Maalox cocktail and liquid Oxycodone.
