HISTORY: 44-year-old woman with chest pain.
FINDINGS: The lung volumes are low due to poor inspiratory effort.
There is no focal consolidation, pulmonary edema, or large pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes without signs for acute cardiopulmonary process.
DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]  Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2102-2-17**] PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION: Indication: History of IVC leiomyoma.
Assess [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] vs thrombus Height: (in) 60 Weight (lb): 200 BSA (m2): 1.87 m2 BP (mm Hg): 112/64 HR (bpm): 74 Status: Inpatient Date/Time: [**2102-2-17**] at 10:57 Test: Portable TEE (Complete) Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler Contrast: None Tape Number: 2007W000-0:00 Test Location: West Other Technical Quality: Adequate REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) 412**] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 413**] MEASUREMENTS: Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: >= 60% (nl >=55%) INTERPRETATION: Findings: LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the LA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Tumor or myxoma in the RA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta with no atherosclerotic plaque.
PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.
Conclusions: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
A large  homogenous mass (suspicious for tumor; thrombus less likely given the size and  appearance) is seen in the right atrium extending from the IVC and filling the  IVC (3cm in diameter) with severely narrowed residual flow.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a  small pericardial effusion.

INDICATION: History of pulmonary embolus and IVC thrombus/tumor.
Please evaluate for pulmonary embolus.
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT images were first obtained through the chest without contrast with a low-dose technique, followed by contrast-enhanced CT angiogram of the chest.
CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Again seen is a massively dilated inferior vena cava containing a large non-enhancing filling defect, which extends into the right atrium.
However, comparison is difficult secondary to different technique.
There is no evidence of mass or thrombus in the right ventricle or pulmonary arteries.
There is no pulmonary embolus.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There are no nodules or areas of airspace consolidation.
There is no pleural effusion.
There is no pathologically enlarged axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Although this examination is not tailored evaluation of the abdominal organs, limited images through the upper abdomen show unremarkable portions of the spleen and kidneys.
The liver shows a small amount of biliary air and metallic clips within the gallbladder fossa.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
Large, nonenhancing filling defect within the IVC extending into the right atrium measuring up to 4 x 7 cm, which has not significantly changed in size since the prior noncontrast examination of [**2101-12-19**].
No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
