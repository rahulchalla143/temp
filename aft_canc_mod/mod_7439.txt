Admission Date:  [**2199-10-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-11-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2145-3-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2199-10-31**] Placement of Right EVD [**2199-11-4**] Placement Right EVD and Posterior Fossa Craniotomy for resection of Right cerebellar lesion.
History of Present Illness: This is a 54 year old woman with one year of intermittent posterior headaches and dizziness whoe was found to have a right Cerebellar mass found on MR during work up.
She also reports nausea and vomiting associated with these headaches.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
A well-defined homogeneously enhancing lesion in the posterior fossa on the right side with morphology, dimensions and extent as described in the text.
Resultant moderate dilatation of bilateral lateral ventricles and third ventricle with transependymal CSF flow.
Inferior tonsillar herniation.
Interval mild decrease of the lateral ventricular dilatation with persistent mild temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] prominence.
Significant mass effect from the large right cerebellar mass remains with significant cerebellar edema, effacement of the fourth ventricle, ambient and quadrigeminal cisterns and mass effect on the mesencephalon and pons and cerebellum.
Ascending transtentorial herniation and the descending herniation of the cerebellar tonsils filling the foramen magnum remains  [**2199-11-1**] CXR No acute cardiothoracic process.
No progression of hydrocephalus.
Stable mass effect from large right cerebellar mass on the brainstem and occipital lobe.
Unchanged mild cerebellar tonsillar herniation downward.
No new hemorrhage, midline shift, or acute large territorial infarction.
Redemonstration of the large homogeneously enhancing mass lesion in the right side of the posterior fossa, unclear if this is intra- or extra-axial, with persistent mass effect on the brainstem and the cerebellar hemisphere with inferior displacement of the tonsils.
2 Ventricular catheter is noted through the right frontal approach with the tip along the medial margin of the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**]- exact location is not well assessed on the present limited sequence study.
[**11-5**] MRI Brain Status post resection of right posterior fossa mass with expected postoperative changes.
No large area of abnormal enhancement, allowing for post-surgical change.
No evidence of hydrocephalus prior to clamping of the EVD.
Appropriately improving post-surgical changes at the right cerebellar surgical bed.
Persistent mild descending cerebellar tonsillar herniation and improving right-sided ascending transtentorial herniation due to mass effect from the right posterior fossa.
No evidence of hydrocephalus, unchanged ventricular size from [**11-8**].
Persistent but improved mass effect from posterior fossa.
She had an MRI of the brain that showed a large 4.7 cm rounded lesion in the right posterior fossa, with significant mass effect on the right cerebellum, and causing leftward midline shift.
She went to the OR with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 104954**] for a righrt EVD placement.
Her drain was functioning well on [**11-1**] and [**11-2**] and she was without neurologic decline.
It was removed and the patient has no sign of hydrocephalus on [**11-3**].
Her EVD was at 10cm H2O and it was well functioning overnight into [**11-5**] and she had no neurologic issues.
She underwent MRI of the brain on [**11-5**] which showed no residual mass and persistent effacement of the 4th ventricle.
On [**11-8**] she had a stable head CT and her EVD was clamped but failed her clamping trial and the EVD was opened for increased ICP's however she had no change in her clinical exam and only minor headaches.
She was given prescriptions and instructions for follow-up.
3. acetaminophen 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for headache.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound was closed with staples or non-dissolvable sutures then you must wait until after they are removed to wash your hair.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**6-16**] days for removal of your sutures and a wound check.
