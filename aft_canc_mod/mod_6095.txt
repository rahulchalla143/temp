The liver was from a 67-year-old woman with normal liver function but who had a liver with 30% macrosteatosis and microsteatosis.
Per the operative report during the transplant after the portal vein was clamped and tied, a few minutes later, the bowels began to swell and the patient began to bleed significantly , due to the increased portal hypertension with clamping the portal vein.
despite clamping as much bleeding as possible, there was significant oozing everywhere.
The donor bile duct was approximately 2 cm, and per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 15283**] note did not feel a duct to duct anastomosis would be done safely, so a Roux-en-Y was performed.
On [**2154-2-1**] the patient was noted to have falling Hcts despite multiple transfusions and he was taken back to the OR with DR [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**] for intra-abdominal hemorrhage s/p liver transplant.
At the time of surgery, when the old incision was opened there was a significant amount of blood in the abdomen.
This was washed out, and although there were no areas of overt bleeding, there was a constant retroperitoneal ooze.
In thre ensuing 24 hours, he continued to have transfusion requirement and was also receiving [**Last Name (LF) 9087**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was taken back once again with DR [**Last Name (STitle) 816**].
After opening the old incsision, a significant amount of clotting was encountered> Again the abdomen was washed out all anastomoses inspected and it was again determined the bleeding was  from the retroperitoneum and diaphragm.
He received 5 days of Unasyn due to multiple intrabdominal excursions.
In the post operative period, the patient reported visual changes.
He was seen by the neurology/stroke consult team who recount the patient report that although he was initially "out of it" while intubated and sedated following the procedures, he recalled visual difficulty on around [**2-5**] or [**2-6**].
A head CT was done showing: Confluent low attenuation in bilateral occipital lobes as well as left caudate head.
MRI of the head showed multiple areas of signal abnormality predominantly in the bilateral posterior cerebral artery distribution involving the occipital lobes bilaterally, with an additional area of involvement in the left caudate head and a couple of punctate foci in the left basal ganglia and internal capsule.
An echo was performed showing mid interatrial septum c/w a small secundum ASD.
Head and neck CTa demonstrated that the carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches appear patent, with no evidence of stenoses, aneurysm, dissection, or thrombus.
Drains were removed once the majority of old blood and clot dissipated.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for incision pain.
