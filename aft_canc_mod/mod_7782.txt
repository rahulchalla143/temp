He underwent an EGD, which showed an esophageal varix and did not undergo any other procedure.
Since then, he has been dealing with severe neck pain and headache that has progressed.
Patient was refered to our Spine center and underwent MRI, which showed disc bulge at pretty much all levels as well as This is suspicious for diffuse infiltrative process or marrow abnormalities.
Clinical correlation is recommended to exclude metastatic disease or myelodysplastic syndrome.
His symptioms are mostly due to weakenss and pain.
He has had poor apetite and poor PO intake and has lost 15 pounds within this time.
He has had 3 falls due to weakness in the last 3 weeks without any head trauma or LOC.
His PCP sent him to our hospital to get an outpatient MRI given that his pain has worsened significantly in his cervical spine, but given that he was feeling very weak and deteriorating fast he was taken to our ED.
He looked cachectic, had clear lungs, was very sleepy, but arousable, underwent NG lavage which showed coffee ground and minimal bright red blood.
GI was consulted, but felt that his neck issues and hyponatremia were more improtant than GIB and therefore scope was partially contraindicated in this scenario and recommended correction of hyponatremia and further evaluation of his spine.
History of bleeding esophageal ulcer 6 weeks ago and had EGD; required 6 RBC units.
History of septic right knee?
History of endocarditis ~2 years ago, that required AVR 4.
Basal cell carcinoma, status post excision.
History of myocardial infarction.
Basal cell carcinoma excision from back.
Right knee surgery.
He is not currently on workmen's compensation or disability.
Family History: Father had cancer of unknown etiology, which was metastatic to spine and died within 2 weeks of diangnosis.

Diffuse abnormal osseous marrow signal concerning for an infiltrative process such as myeloma, lymphoma, leukemia or metastases.
Likely pathologic fracture of the T12 vertebral body with severe spinal canal narrowing as described.
More focal abnormal enhancement within the posterior elements of T12 and L1 suggests more severe osseous involvement at these levels.
Circumferential epidural and dural enhancement at the L3 and L4 levels is also suspicious for an infiltrative process such as myeloma, lymphoma, leukemia or metastases.
Left lower lobe pneumonia.
Left upper lobe densities likely reflecting early pneumonia.
No evidence of malignancy on this study.
However, given the presence of a bony lesion within a recent cervical spine study, a followup chest examination should be obtained following resolution of the pneumonia to rule out an underlying mass.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Multiple hepatic cysts.
Hypodense renal lesions, statistically most likely to be cysts.
Multiple lytic lesions in the imaged bones, suspicious for either metastatic disease, multiple myeloma, or lymphoma/leukemia.
Abnormal prevertebral soft tissue thickening in the upper cervical spine, better evaluated on the preceding contrast-enhanced MRI.
Abnormal opacities in the imaged apical left lung.
Abundant acute inflammation.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
Technically suboptimal to exclude focal wall motion abnormality.
Portable TEE (Complete) Done [**2174-5-12**] at 2:40:00 PM      FINAL No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic valve abscess is seen.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of prosthetic or native valve endocarditis.
Mucosa: Linear esophagitis with erosions, no ulcer and no bleeding, was seen in the lower third of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction, starting at 31 cm from the incisors.
Other Specifically, no ulcer, varix, or mass was seen in the esophagus.
Impression: NG tube in place Linear esophagitis with erosions in the lower esophagus and GE junction No ulcer, varix, or mass in the esophagus Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: The findings account for the symptoms Continue high-dose PPI 40mg [**Hospital1 **] .
BONE SCAN Study Date of [**2174-5-13**] Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and posterior projections showing multifocal patchy increased tracer uptake in both proximal and distal medial femoral metadiaphysis, in both humeri, the calvarium, the spine, and diffusely in multiple bilateral ribs, the left scapula and claviculae, concerning for diffuse metastatic disease.
These findings correspond to subtle, mixed lytic/sclerotic lesions on CT.
Increased uptake in a T12 compression fx, degenerative changes at the left hip, bilateral glenohumeral and femoroacetabular joints.
The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer excretion.
IMPRESSION: The above described findings are consistent with diffuse metastatic bony disease.
The proximal femoral shafts which show relatively prominent increased activity may offer a biopsy site, but there are many alternatives.
BONE MARROW Biopsy final results pending  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a very nice 54 YO gentleman with CAD s/p MI and h/o endocarditis s/p bioprosthetic AVR with recent history of GIB requiring 6 RBC units comes to the emergency room with fatigue and progressive failure to thrive at home [**1-26**] diffuse bone lesions (malignancy of unknown primary), pneumonia, GI bleed, hyponatremia.
Bone lesions:  Likely source of diffuse pain and failure to thrive at home.
MRI was done of spine which showed diffuse lesions appearing to be malignant, along with pathologic fracture at T12.
Oncology service was contact[**Name (NI) **] given lytic lesions appeared suspicious for malignancy, bone marrow biopsy was done.
Final read pending, but suggestive of carcinoma.
Bone scan was done for further evaluation, and showed diffuse bone lesions through out the body.
CEA mildly elevated, PSA within normal limits.
No lesions on CT torso to suggest a primary malignancy.
Also on the differential for bone pain andlesions, along with weight loss, was endocarditis which was ruled out by TEE.
Because of extent of disease and patient discomfort, decision was made by family to extubate patient (intubated for PNA, discussed below) and focus on comfort measures.
Palliative care consulted and made recommendations for pain control.
Pneumonia:  Pt initially admitted with respiratory distress and was intubated for desat to low 80s on 15 L facemask.
CXR with infitlrate in LLL and LUL suggesting multifocal PNA.
Bronchoscopy was done x 3 for diagnosis and the final time for potential symptomatic relief prior to extubation for comfort, above.
GI team was consulted and EGD was done which showed erosions in linear esophagus and GE junction, otherwise normal EGD to third part of duodenum.
Hyponatremia - Initially was in setting of hypovolemia given upper GI bleed, poor PO intake.
As volume status improved, urine lytes reassessed and suggested increased secretion of ADH, possibly SIADH in setting of malignancy vs pain.
liver disease: pt with elevated transaminases and cholestatic picture given elevated alk phos and conjugated bilirubinemia.
Medications on Admission: Carvedilol 6.25 mg PO Daily Pravastatin 40 mg PO daily Aspirin 81 mg PO Daily Lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide 20 mg-12.5 mg Tab PO Daily Colace 100 mg Cap PO BID Oxycodone 5 mg PO Q6 Hrs PRN pain Gabapentin 300 mg PO QHS Multivitamin PO daily [**Doctor Last Name **] Milk of Magnesia -- Unknown Strength   Discharge Medications: 1. scopolamine base 1.5 mg Patch 72 hr Sig: One (1) Patch 72 hr Transdermal ONCE (Once).
Disp:*100 mL* Refills:*2* 5. acetaminophen 650 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every six (6) hours as needed for fever or pain.
Home oxygen Please supply with home oxygen by nasal cannula for comfort   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital3 **]Hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: Pneumonia Upper gastrointestinal bleed Anemia Hyponatremia Bone lesions   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You were also intubated and your breathing was helped by a breathing machine, but this tube was removed and you were able to breathe on your own.
In addition you were found to have low blood counts for which you received blood transfusions that was likely due to a bleed in your gastrointestinal tract.
You were also found to have pain in many locations.
This is likely due to a disease in your bones which appears to be a type of cancer (carcinoma) but an exact diagnosis was not reached after getting a bone biopsy.
Changes to your medications: - START taking morphine 30-60 mg by mouth every two hours as needed for pain - START taking hyoscyamine 0.125 mg under your tongue four times a day - START using fentanyl patch 150 mcg/hr, change every 72 hours - START using scopolamine patch - START taking tylenol 650 mg as needed for pain - START using oxygen by nasal canula for comfort  - STOP taking carvedilol, pravastatin, aspirin, lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide, gabapentin, oxycodone   Followup Instructions: please discuss any concerns that arise with your hospice nurse.
