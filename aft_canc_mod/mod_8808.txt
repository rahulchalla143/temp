History of Present Illness: This 55-year-old female presented with carcinoma of the right breast diagnosed [**2102-9-12**].
At that time, imaging suggested that the cancer was increasing in size and was multicentric in nature.
Of note, her clinical course was complicated by venous outflow obstruction of a right upper extremity AV fistula leading to varices that involved the right side of the torso, extending up into the neck, into the axilla, and around to the back.
On [**2104-9-9**], she underwent a venogram and dilatation of a tight stenosis centrally of the outflow from the fistula.
She had some response of the dilated veins.
It was felt that she was not a candidate for chemotherapy due to multiple other medical problems, including her end-stage renal disease and HIV infection since [**2086**], as well as severe hypertension.
Due to the multifocal nature of her disease, she was not a candidate for breast-conserving surgery.
In the context of the disease progression, mastectomy was felt to be the only appropriate way to proceed for local control.
No opportunistic infections.
