Admission Date:  [**2128-7-15**]     Discharge Date:  [**2128-8-4**]  Date of Birth:   [**2077-9-13**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Transplant Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 50-year-old gentleman with end-stage liver disease secondary to hepatitis C who presented to [**Hospital1 69**] for a liver transplant.
Prior to his transplant, the patient had encephalopathy as well as a significant history of gastrointestinal bleeds.
An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 65%, and there was no cardiac history.
End-stage liver disease (secondary to hepatitis C).
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
The abdomen was mildly distended.
The abdomen was soft and nontender.
Extremity examination revealed no tenderness.
The operation went without any complications, and the patient was brought to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit intubated and sedated for monitoring of cardiovascular and pulmonary status overnight.
On postoperative day one, the patient underwent a Duplex ultrasound of the liver which revealed normal blood flow and no biliary obstruction.
The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition for nutritional support.
On postoperative day two, the patient developed some chest pressure which seemed to be associated with being given intravenous CellCept.
The patient was mildly bradycardic, but was still maintaining good hemodynamics.
An echocardiogram of the heart indicated inferior wall motion abnormalities with 2 to 3+ mitral regurgitation.
It was decided not to take the patient to the Catheterization Laboratory secondary to increased risk of bleeding.
However, by postoperative day ten, the patient started to develop some nausea and bouts of emesis.
A KUB revealed some air/fluid levels, but gas was present in the colon to the rectum.
They were coffee-brown in color, so an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed which revealed some mild gastritis.
The patient had a computed tomography scan of the abdomen which revealed normal hepatic flow; however, there was dilated loops of small bowel with a question of an ischemic process.
The patient then underwent an upper gastrointestinal swallow which indicated a mechanical partial small-bowel obstruction with dilation of both limbs of Roux-en-Y proximal to jejunostomy with decompressed small bowel afterwards; likely due to an adhesion.
Before discharge, the patient had a repeat echocardiogram which still revealed an unchanged inferior wall motion abnormality; however, there was significant improvement with only mild mitral regurgitation.
The patient had a slight bump in his creatinine secondary to an increased level of cyclosporin which was subsequently decreased.
