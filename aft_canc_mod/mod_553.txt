Discharge exam -patient passed away, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] pronounced patient  Pertinent Results: [**2154-10-7**] 11:00AM   WBC-7.1 RBC-2.33*# HGB-6.2*# HCT-22.0*# MCV-95# MCH-26.6* MCHC-28.1* RDW-22.6* [**2154-10-7**] 11:00AM   PLT SMR-NORMAL PLT COUNT-391# [**2154-10-7**] 12:57PM   PT-12.2 PTT-29.1 INR(PT)-1.1  [**2154-10-7**] 11:00AM   cTropnT-<0.01 [**2154-10-7**] 11:00AM   GLUCOSE-109* UREA N-32* CREAT-1.5* SODIUM-141 POTASSIUM-4.7 CHLORIDE-103 TOTAL CO2-27 ANION GAP-16 [**2154-10-7**] 11:00AM   CALCIUM-8.9 PHOSPHATE-3.9 MAGNESIUM-2.5  [**2154-10-7**] CXR (PA/lat) IMPRESSION: Increased opacity at the right lung base, likely a combination of effusion and atelectasis, though underlying pneumonia difficult to exclude.
[**2154-10-8**] CXR (portable) IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**10-7**]: There is greater consolidation at the right lung base today, which could be atelectasis worsening in the setting of persistent moderate right pleural effusion or worsening pneumonia.
Improvement in perihilar opacification in the left mid lung may be a function of difference in radiographic technique.
The area is not clear, whether it is edema or a second focus of pneumonia, is radiographically indeterminate.
Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is longstanding.
Large-volume hemoperitoneum concerning for bleeding from diffuse peritoneal metastases, though there is no active extravasation.
Increased right pleural effusion with possibly hemorrhagic contents, raising the question of thoracoabdominal communication through a diaphragmatic rent.
Volume overload.
Mild interval increase in the complex abdominal fluid, likely hemoperitoneum, compared to [**2154-10-10**].
Mild interval increase in the hemorrhagic moderate-to-large right pleural effusion.
Foci of hyperdensity within the anterior aspect of the left side of the hemoperitoneum may represent residual contrast within bowel.
Overall, no significant change in attenuation of the hemoperitoneum to suggest accumulating acute blood product.
Stable moderate right basilar high density pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis.
Completely decompressed urinary bladder with Foley catheter in place and no residual urine noted within the bladder.
Large amount of pelvic hemoperitoneum overlies the urinary bladder superiorly.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
On review of the prior CT, no distended bladder is identified - it is possible that the post void residual seen was due to above loculated hemoperitoneum given the extent of fluid as described.
Complete drainage of right pleural fluid collection after placement of right basal pleural catheter.
Intervally enlarged epicardial lymph node with possibly enlarging right hilar lymph nodes are not fully assessed on this non-contrast study.
Complex ascites and other findings of known intra-abdominal malignancy are incompletely assessed on this study.
Mild interval increase in high density ascites along the left paracolic gutter, representing mild progression of hemoperitoneum compared to [**2154-10-15**].
Interval drainage of right pleural effusion with pleural catheter in place and hydropneumothorax.
No evidence of renal vein compression in particular (as queried) given the limitations of this non-contrast study.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo w/GIST, diastolic CHF, Afib presents with dyspnea on exertion and chest pain, found to have dropping Hgb likely source was hemoperitoneum and hemothorax .
# Symptomatic Acute Blood Loss Anemia: [**2-14**] GIST tumor bleeding pt received a total of 3 units pRBC with improvement in her symptoms.
CT abd/pelvis to look for recurrent RP bleed, was delayed due to [**Last Name (un) **] as the study required contrast.
Repeat non-contrast CT's showed relatively stable hemoperitoneum, but did suggest expanding pleural effusion, suggesting potential blood loss into the thorax.
She was also seen by Surgery Consult for possible surgical intervention, however, given the metastatic disease, she is a poor surgical candidate.
Her case was discussed with IR and they could not see a localized source of bleeding on the CT scans and suggested a tagged RBC scan to further eval for bleeding.
However, b/c of [**Last Name (un) **], even if a tagged RBC scan could localize bleeding, angiography and intervention would come at high risk for worsening [**Last Name (un) **] given contrast load and risk of contrast-induced nephropathy.
Of note, pt was found to have her brought to the hospital her own pill bottles from home of sorafenib, and had to be instructed multiple times not to take her own pills.
Her care was further d/w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and there are no chemo options at this time that will provided acute resolution of her bleed.
Pt then developed volume overload with hydration.
# Worsening Pleural Effusion Initially felt to be possibly due to [**Last Name (LF) 9215**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was diuresed, with improvement in her respiratory status.
CT scan however, showed significantly larger right-sided pleural effusion.
IP was consulted for a thoracentesis and a chest tube was placed, which drained significantly bloody effusion.
The effusion was consistent with exudative effusion and hemothorax, as it had a Hct of 39.
The pt continued to have bloody drainage, suggesting possible connection between the abdominal cavity and hemoperitoneum with the thoracic cavity and pleural space.
# Acute Kidney Injury / Acute Renal Failure Presented with [**Last Name (un) **] with elevated Creatinine to 1.6 (baseline 1) in the setting of anemia.
Improved after transfusion of PRBC's as well as IV diuresis for presumed volume overload with acute on chronic [**Last Name (un) 9215**].
[**Last Name (un) **] then recurred, in the setting of intravascular volume depletion with acute blood loss anemia and aggressive IV diuresis.
Urine lytes c/w pre-renal etiology, Foley catheter placement and abdominal imaging ruled out post-renal obstruction.
Was seen by Renal Consult service due to oliguria, sediment showed non-specific granular casts, but no overt evidence of ATN.
Per daughter/HCP, do not want to proceed with surgery and paracentesis not an option given increased risk of bleeding.
CT abdomen was obtained which showed mild interval increase of bleeding in the peritoneum cavity and diffuse omental and peritoneal metastases.
There was no evidence of renal vein compression, but image was limited as it was non-contrast.
Patient had a period of resp distress with spo2 in low 80s and appeared cyanotic, but improved with sitting up on chair and morphine.
A family meeting with [**Name (NI) 13762**] (HCP/daughter), ICU team, palliative care, and social work occurred on [**10-21**] with decision to move to comfort care.
She was started on dilaudid IV 0.3-0.6mg q1h:PRN for shortness of breath and pain.
