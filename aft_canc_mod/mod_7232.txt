Radical resection of right thigh mass 2.
Prophylactic internal fixation right femur with an 11 hole DC plate 3.
Exposure of superficial femoral and profunda arteries with a separate medial thigh incision by Vascular surgery   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 50-year-old gentleman who presented with a large mass in his right anterior thigh 2-3 months ago.
He was evaluated and found to have a large mass deep in his quadriceps adjacent to the bone.
Biopsy of this showed elements of sarcoma and carcinoma intermixed and he also was found to have pulmonary metastases.
It was recommended that he consider chemotherapy for his pulmonary mets but he strongly desired to have this thigh mass removed first and therefore he was brought to the operating room today for that procedure.
Past Medical History: Patient developed small R thigh pain/mass in [**7-5**] which was felt to be was bursitis but as the mass enlarged the area was more painful which prompted another ER evaluation and MRI confirming presence of this mass in the R thigh.
CT guided biopsy on [**2183-10-24**] was consistent with carcinoma with spindle and epithelial morphology focally CK positive and TTF-1 positive.
The patient also underwent U/S guided biopsy of a thyroid nodule which showed atypical cells but not clearly malignant.
Further imaging with PET and CT demonstrates a R thyroid lobe mass, scattered small pulm nodules, mildly FDG avid region in the L adrenal gland and L psoas muscle and a 20cm R thigh mass in the region of the femur without bony involvement or FDG uptake within the skeleton.
While in the PACU the patient became tachycardic and hypotensive with low UOP, his thigh incision was draining bloody fluid (300cc in 2 hours).
The tachycardia and hypotension were secondary to hypovolemia, he was transfused a total of 4 units pRBC's (Hgb 7.7) o/n.
Of note he was started on Hydrocortisone in the ICU secondary to a low random cortisol (0.6).
He was started in SSI secondary to elevated blood sugar secondary to the steroid.
At discharge he was voiding spontaneously, tolerating PO diet, and pain was controlled.
He was afebrile and hemodynamically stable at discharge.
