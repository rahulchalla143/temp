Admission Date:  [**2179-9-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-9-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2109-9-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Quinolones  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: Chief Complaint/Reason for Transfer: transfer from SICU for ongoing management of respiratory failure, renal failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**9-24**]: PICC placed, tunnelled HD line placed, trach and PEG  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 40860**] is a 69 year old man with a history of obesity and DM2 who was initially transferred to the SICU service from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on [**2179-9-10**] for Group A Strep septic shock and copmartment syndrome.
Per the patient's chart, he fell at home on [**2179-9-1**] (presumably with an injury to his left leg) with persistent left leg pain.
On [**2179-9-4**], he began having fevers to 103.
On [**2179-9-7**], he was reportedly delirious in the setting of ongoing fevers and was lying on the floor for several hours unable to call EMS.
There, he had a leukocytosis to 18.4 with 58% neutrophils and 39% bands, creatinine 1.5, lactate of 3.9, and an anion gap of 15; he was also hypoxemic with a 3 L.min oxygen requirement.
Plain films of his left leg showed no evidence of gas in his soft tissues.
On [**2179-9-8**], he was fiberoptically intubated for mental status changes and also had transient atrial fibrillation controlled with digoxin and beta blockade; antibiotics were changes to penicillin and clindamycin.
On [**2179-9-9**], he was taken to the OR for exploration of his left calf and underwent fasciotomy; per the operative note, there was no evidence of myonecrosis.
He experienced post-operative hypotension requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressors.
He was noted to be in oliguric acute renal failure and nephrology was consulted; they believed his renal failure to be due to ischemic ATN in the setting of septic shock and was started on CVVH.
He was seen by orthopedics who determined that there was no evidence of compartment syndrome.
He has had persistent renal failure, however, requiring CVVH and has been difficult to wean from the ventillator.
Review of Systems: Unable to obtain directly from patient due to intubated/sedated state.
Past Medical History: - type 2 diabetes on non-insulin home agents - hypertension - hyperlipidemia - gout - obesity  Social History: Retired antique dealer who lives with his wife.

There is increased density in the retrocardiac area consistent with atelectasis or consolidation.
There is no definite interval change.
TTE ([**2179-9-11**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.

## Respiratory failure: From [**9-9**] until [**9-20**], the patient developed a progressive leukocytosis and persistent fever with thick secretions despite treatment for VAP with clinda/vanc/zosyn.
Because of this, he was felt to have an ESBL GNR VAP.
He did not tolerate a PMV on [**9-27**] due to secretions.
## Group A Strep Septic Shock: When patient presented to OSH, he was in severe septic shock with hypotension.
Also noted above, his leukocytosis and fever resolved.
## Acute renal failure due to ischemic ATN +/- mild rhabdomyolysis (peak CK ~3800) in the setting of septic shock.
## Hypertension: Patient's home medications were held as he was initially hypotensive and many of his home meds are renally metabolized.
His HTN was mildly responsive to fluid removal with HD but was thought mainly to be related to pain as his BP increased dramatically with any movement.
His pain was controlled with standing tylenol and a fentanyl patch along with tapering prn fentanyl boluses.
## Compartment syndrome s/p fasciotomy: A wound care consult was placed and plastic surgery evaluated the fasciotomy sites for further management options.
?d in setting of acute illness with elevated CK.
## Right Renal Mass on CT c/w Renal Cell Carcinoma: This was discussed with the patient's wife and son.
## Atrial fibrillation: Reportedly, the patient had brief post-op atrial fibrillation at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.
