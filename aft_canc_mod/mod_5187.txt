This likely explains fever, scapular pain, and hypotension/early sepsis.
Most likely severe bacterial pneumonia, rather than TB (no risk factors) or other etiology of cavitation.
WBC not elevated, but there is a left shift without bands.
Pt treated broadly for pneumonia with vanco, cipro, and flagyl to cover community acquired pneumonia, possible post-obstructive vs. aspiration, as well as S. aureus given large cavitation.
She was switched to vanc/zosyn for obstructive PNA based on CT scan showing attenuation of L bronchus from increasing hilar mass.
has been afebrile since the day of admit.
On transfer to the floor, she was switched from vanc/zosyn to levofloxacin (day 1 abx was [**11-21**]) for community-acquired PNA, as has been stable.
She was stable, afebrile on oral abx.
As the tumor was compressing the L bronchus, IP placement of stent was considered.
# Hypocalcemia: Formerly treated for hypercalcemia related to her squamous cell lung CA.
Was somewhat hypocalcemic and hypophosphatemic, despite repletion, likely  [**2-7**] previous zomeda tx.
# Anemia: Likely ACD due to malignancy, as Fe low, ferritin high, TIBC, transferrin low.

She had no guaiac positive stools and her hct rebounded on its own to 27 at time of discharge.
However, if reversible respiratory decompensation occurs due to pneumonia, may need to readdress DNI status with patient.
