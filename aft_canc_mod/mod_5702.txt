Patient's parents noted lower extremity swelling, left greater than right for last several months.
Presented to her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 1 week PTP who felt she may have heart failure and started empiric diuresis (patient is adverse to testing and becomes very anxious) Started on 40 mg PO lasix daily at that time with moderate improvement in her LE swelling.
Additionally having sore throat, copious rhinorrhea, dry cough, which per report appeared to improve.
per patient's family, she has had no changes in baseline mental status, and has not had any vomiting, chest pain, abd pain, diarrhea, or dysuria although patient is a poor historian.
OSH xray showed diffuse underlying interstitial lung disease, a new large L pleural effusion, small R pleural effusion, mild congestive failure, LLL consolidation, ?RLL consolidation as well.
CT chest at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] showed interstitial edema, LLL collapse, b/l pleural effusions, and small pericardial effusion.
In the ED, patient was afebrile satting 97% on 5L.
She was given Vancomycin 1gm IV for possible pneumonia and was admitted to the MICU for possible thoracentesis and further management.
Thoracentesis was considered but deferred given patients stability and anticipated difficulty for performing thoracentesis in this patient with mental retardation.
An ECHO was performed which failed to show evidence of heart failure (EF 55%), but did confirm trivial pericardial effussion as well as possible small PFO.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.

There was no gross aspiration or penetration.
[**8-23**] CT NECK, THORAX, ABDOMEN, PELVIS: CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There are multiple bilateral supraclavicular nodes, the largest on the left, measuring 16 x 16 mm (3:10).
There is a 17 x 15 mm upper paratracheal node (3:18).
There is a lower right paratracheal node measuring 15 x 12 mm (3:27) and a subcarinal lymph node measuring 39 x 19 mm (3:35).
There is bilateral hilar adenopathy with a left-sided hilar node measuring 16 x 14 mm (3:31) and a right-sided hilar lymph node measuring 19 x 14 mm (3:32).
There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
There is interlobular septal thickening bilaterally and diffuse alveolar ground glass opacity consistent with diffuse pulmonary edema.
The trachea, right main bronchus and segmental and subsegmental branches of the right main bronchus are patent.
There is dense consolidation of the left lower lobe with hypoattenuating areas within the lung parenchyma which may be due to ischemia or hypoperfusion.
There is right lower lobe consolidation.
There are diffuse peribronchovascular nodular areas within the lungs bilaterally, predominantly within the mid and lower zones.
No dominant pulmonary mass is identified to suggest a lung primary.
No endobronchial lesion is identified.
There are large bilateral pleural effusions.
No pericardial effusion.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic ductal dilatation.
Both kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without evidence of hydronephrosis.

The findings are consistent with pulmonary edema and additional neoplastic and/or infectious airspace disease.
In the setting of positive pleural cytology, mediastinal adenopathy and obstructive disease in left lower lobe, findings are concerning for diffuse malignancy.
Pulmonary edema may be noncardiogenic or due to lymphatic obstruction.
While no definite dominant mass is identified to suggest a lung primary, abrupt narrowing of the left lower lobe bronchus with dense left lower lobe consolidation is noted suggesting a focal or endobronchial mass at that location.
Hypoattenuating areas within the left lower lobe consolidation suggest infarction/hypoperfusion.
Large bilateral pleural effusions.
Cecal wall thickening which is of doubtful significance.
A definite primary neoplastic lesion is not identified in the abdomen or pelvis.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 44 year old female with congenital developmental delay who presented initially to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with fever, shortness of breath, weight gain, and lower extremity swelling then transferred to the MICU for with suspicion of bilateral pneumonia and left sided pleural effusion.
She was later found have adenocarcinoma of unknown primary (likely lung versus breast) with likely lymphangitic spread to lung.
# Adenocarcinoma: Found in pleural fluid, unknown primary.
CT torso showed likely lymphangitic spread rather than pneumonia.
Possible primary in lung with many enlarged lymph nodes in neck, no evidence for primary cancer in abdomen.
No mets to liver.
# Possible Healthcare Associated Pneumonia:  Upon admission, patient had a CT scan from the outside hospital which was concerning for multifocal, bilateral pneumonia.
However, after repeat CT and the discovery of adenocarcinoma in the pleural fluid, the thought was that this may actually be lymphangitic spread of adenocarcinoma.
She did have a leukocytosis and spiked a low grade fever x1.
A video swallow was performed to rule out aspiration as a cause of pneumonia.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management of ongoing hypoxia with oncology and interventional pulmonology following.
# Pulmonary effusions: Pleural fluid results positive for adenocarcinoma of unknown primary.
The drain put out an initial 2L, but then was non-productive for 36 hours and at the request of the family was removed for comfort of the patient.
# Borderline hypotension and tachycardia: During admission, she was persistently with systolic blood pressures 90s-100s.
There was not concern that this represented sepsis as she did not have other signs pointing toward an infection.
# Elevated international normalized ratio (INR):  Upon admission, she had an elevated INR, possibly from poor PO intake.
# Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): Present on admission, Creatinine remained stable.
No masses seen on CT neck to explain source of adenocarcinoma.

You were admitted to the hospital because you were having difficulty breathing.
You were found to have pneumonia and also an accumulation of fluid around your lungs--called a pleural effusion.
