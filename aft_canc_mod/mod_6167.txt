A cholecystectomy was performed as well as an open liver biopsy given the nodular appearance of his liver, felt to be consistent with cirrhosis.
He was transferred to the medicine service at [**Hospital1 **] where discussion was held concerning transplant given the extent of his liver disease, based on the liver biopsy which showed cirrhosis with moderate activity.
Hepatitis serologies showed immunization against hepatitis A and B with no hepatitis C and the etiology was felt to be alcoholic cirrhosis.
His hospital course was later significant for discovery of a portal vein occlusion on US on [**11-5**] and encephalopathy despite Lactulose/Rifaximin, guaiac negative stools and negative infectious work-up.
Additionally, his creatinine began to worsen and the renal team was consulted at the onset of the elevation and suspected hepatorenal syndrome in light of the patient's liver disease, an undetectable urine sodium and normal renal ultrasound.
He was started on Midodrine and Octreotide on [**11-3**] with delay in the progression of his renal failure, though it eventually increased to 5.2 (from baseline 0.8) at the time of transfer.
Patient was also noted to have mental status changes felt to be secondary to uremia and for this reason, an HD line was placed for impending HD.
Since liver transplantation was being considered, the decision was made to transfer the patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and thus patient was    Past Medical History: Alcoholic Cirrhosis s/p repair of liver laceration Hepatorenal syndrome  Social History: Patient reports heavy alcoholism, but stopped approximately 4 months ago.
He denies illicit drug use, has no tattoos or piercing and denies a history of blood transfusions.

There are bilateral small pleural effusions, left greater than right.
The liver is shrunken and nodular consistent with cirrhosis.
No arterially enhancing lesions are identified.
There are two tiny sub-7 mm hypodense lesion in the left and right lobes of the liver which is too small to characterize, but likely simple cysts.
There is no pathologic adenopathy.
There is a small hiatal hernia.
Impression: Normal mucosa in the colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations: CT colonography for evaluation of the right colon and cecum  EGD ([**11-25**]): Tortuous esophagus Blood in the stomach body Normal mucosa in the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  CT colongraphy ([**11-25**]): Possible flat lesion (vs adherent stool) within the mid to distal one third of the transverse colon.
Otherwise, no significant polyp or mass identified greater than 1 cm.
TEE ([**11-28**]): No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta seen up to 45cm from the incisor.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Impression: possible pulmonary arteriovenous shunt.
No significant valvular disease.
Head CT ([**12-1**]): There is a 10 mm focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the  right parietal lobe.
There are also hypodense lesions in the left frontal lobe, which most likely represent small vessel ischemic change.
No shift of midline structures is noted.
The visualized part of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
Repeat Head CT ([**12-1**]): There has been no interval change since two hours ago.
10 mm right parietal hemorrhage is unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: At [**Hospital6 **] he underwent an exploratory laparotomy and was found to be bleeding from multiple segments of his liver.
The liver biopsy showed cirrhosis with moderative activity.
His hospital course was complicated by a portal vein occulsion on US on [**11-5**] and encephalopathy initially unresponsive to lacutlose and rifaximin.
He also experience ARF and was thought to have hepatorenal syndrome therefore he was started on midodrine and octreotide on [**11-3**].
He underwent an extensive workup including 2 colonoscopies with a biopsy of a polyp found to be an adenoma in the transverse colon.
On [**11-30**], he was found to have acute change in mental status.
A diagnostic paracentesis showed no evidence of SBP.
Head CT showed a 1 cm acute Rt-parietal hemorrhage.
The patient was then found to have eye deviation to the left and intermittent upper extrem jerking.
Neurology thought he was having a non-convulsive status and ativan was given x 1.
Repeat head CT showed no change.
Chronic ischemic changes were seen on MRI from [**2144**].
In the MICU he was started on keppra and he underwent an EEG which showed no seizure activity.
Mental status change was partially attributed to hepatic encephalopathy and increased doses of lactulose and rifaximin were given.
This demonstrated four lesions in the brain parenchyma, as seen on the FLAIR sequence, one of which had blood products within and corresponded to the previously noted small intraparenchymal hematoma in the right parietal lobe.
No surrounding edema or mass effect was noted.
A small 5 mm homogeneous hyperintense lesion in the right inferior frontal lobe.
The exact nature of these lesions was not clear from the present study.
He did not appear to have residual deficits on his neuro exam.
He experienced lower GI bleeding on [**12-2**] with Hct drop so 4 units PRBC, 4 units FFP, and 1 unit of plt were given.
Hct stablized and he had no further bleeding, so it was thought it was secondary to the polyp.
Zosyn had been started empirically for SBP initally, however the diagnostic para showed no sign of infection and the patient developed a maculopapular rash on his legs so this was stopped.
The abdominal erythema around his healing incision had increased, so vancomycin was started for possible cellulitis.
Derm felt the drug rash was benign and recommended vancomycin for the abdominal cellulitis.
He underwent transplant of both organs and required hepaticojejunostomy for a bile leak.
Please refer to operative reports for complete details.
This was a difficult evaluation of the hepatic artery, with normal waveforms (good systolic upstroke), but decreased velocities, particularly in the left and right hepatic arteries.
No definite evidence of arterial stenosis.
JP drain output was high initially, but diminished.
He experienced diarrhea when feedings were cycled so, continuous feedings were resumed.
He required a 1:1 sitter briefly to prevent further inadvertant removal of the feeding tube.
Diet was advanced and tolerated, but intake was poor due to poor appetite and mental status (flat affect/decreased energy).
On [**1-9**], he experienced hypotension while ambulating.
The Roux tube was capped after cholangiogram on [**1-5**] that showed Roux tube located in the jejunum, no opacification of biliary tree was likely due to partial withdrawal of the tube into jejunum.
Abdomen was soft and non-distended.
He may have had increased levels due to some diarrhea that he experienced on [**1-13**] and [**1-14**] that resolved with resuming continuous tube feeds vs. cycled tube feeds.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for assist with management of hyperglycemia (due to the steroids) that started immediately postop in the SICU when he required an insulin drip.
