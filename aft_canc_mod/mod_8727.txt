No EKG changes in setting of acute SOB 2.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: s/p VT and pacer placement on amiodarone coumadin and metoprolol.
Wound site without evidence of infection.
Pt with multiple episodes of supratherapeutic INR.
- continue amiodarone, metoprolol, will hold coumadin for now given bleeding risk but continue ASA .
