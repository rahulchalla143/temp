Admission Date:  [**2194-4-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2194-5-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2150-11-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3227**] Chief Complaint: left frontoparietal tumor  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**4-25**] Left Craniotomy   History of Present Illness: 43-year-old gentleman who initially presented with a dominant generalized tonic-clonic seizure.
Workup revealed a left frontal mass.
The patient underwent biopsy of this mass for tissue diagnosis.
Pathology analysis revealed gemiscytic astrocytoma (WHO II) without oligo component.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Discharge exam: PERRLA, EOMs full, VF full Expressive aphasia with word finding difficulty.
Right-Sided Facial droop Rightward tounge deviation Motor: D   B   T   Gr   IP   Q   H   AT   [**Last Name (un) 938**]   G Right  1  3   5   5-   5    5   5   5-    3     5   Pertinent Results: fMRI The expected activation areas during the functional paradigms were demonstrated, during the movement of the right hand, there is no evidence of areas close to the left frontal neoplasm.
During the movement of the tongue and language paradigms, areas of activation were demonstrated anterior to the mass lesion in the frontal lobe  [**4-26**] MRI Brain: CONCLUSION: Preoperative localization for tumor surgery.
The focus of enhancement suggests the lesion may be higher than grade II.
Status post left temporal tumor resection with pneumocephalus and tiny blood products post-surgical at the surgical bed.
Persistent vasogenic edema in the left frontotemporal region.
Mild interval worsening of hypodensity at the left frontal white matter near surgical bed, could be mild interval worsening edema; however, cannot exclude focal ischemia.
No large acute hemorrhage.
[**4-25**] MRI Brain (post op):IMPRESSION: Status post resection of left temporal and posterior frontal mass.
Small residual area of enhancement at the superior aspect of the surgical cavity is identified.
No significant increase in edema is seen, but slow diffusion is seen at the margin of the surgical cavity with a small focus more deeper to the margin of the surgical cavity which could be related to ischemia or could also be due to postoperative change.
No territorial infarcts are seen, however.
[**4-26**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: No evidence of new hemorrhage.
Increased parafalcine air likely represents redistribution of moderate pneumocephalus.
Vasogenic edema and blood products at the resection site appear stable.
There is persistent extension of hypodensity into the left frontal lobe, which may represent vasogenic edema.
Very extensive, acute pulmonary embolism with associated pulmonary arterial and right ventricular hypertension.
[**4-30**] Lower Extremity Venous Ultrasound: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in bilateral lower extremity.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**5-1**] Ct Head: Stable appearance of the left parietal lobe resection bed, with minimal post-surgical blood products and surrounding frontoparietal edema.
Stable minimal rightward shift of midline structures and effacement of the left cerebral hemispheric sulci.
No new intracranial hemorrhage.
Surgery was without complication but upon awakening the patient was right hemiplegia.
A CT was performed immediately which showed no hemorrhage or obvious infarct.
An MRI was performed that night which demonstrated no evidence of CVA.
While ambulating with physical therapy in the afternoon the patient became hypotensive with decreased oxygen saturations and complained of anxiety.
LENI's and a CTA were ordered to evaluate for DVT and PE.
He c/o intermittent chest pain with deep inspiration, at times [**8-24**] and described as a cramping pain.
The patient's right-sided strength improved during his hospital stay and he worked with PT, OT and Speech Therapy.
At the time of discharge he was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating with a walker, afebrile with stable vital signs.
Medications on Admission: Keppra  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Left frontoparietal Tumor Global Aphasia - expressive aphasia Dysarthria Bilateral Pulmonary Emboli Rash   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Please taper Dilantin to off over 4 days and Continue on Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] for Seizure prophylaxis.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You are tapering off of Dilantin and being transitioned to Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prevention.
Make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
Followup as below in Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic for a wound check.
