He underwent a colonoscopy that showed extensive blood throughout the entire colon, and intubation of the terminal ileum showed blood coming from above.
He was deemed to have a bleeding site within the small bowel.
The bleeding was fairly brisk and required multiple units of packed red blood cell transfusions.
He underwent a GI bleeding study on the night of his admission that showed immediate tracer activity within the left upper quadrant and over the next 90 minutes, the activity proceeded toward the right lower quadrant suggestive of a bleeding source in the proximal small bowel, perhaps near the ligament of Treitz.
However, a blush was seen in the left upper quadrant within the proximal jejunum, suspicious for possible stromal neoplasm at that site.
This showed a 3.5 x 2 x 2.1 cm enhancing soft tissue mass in the left upper quadrant likely arising from the proximal jejunum.
There was no definite evidence of metastatic disease, only 2 simple cysts within the liver.
Past Medical History: CBC was nl except for a borderline low hct and hgb, stable since at least [**2107**], w/ previous workup neg for most causes of anemia (in the setting of a normal colonoscopy in [**2107**]).
Food in the antrum and duodenum No blood was seen in the stomach, duodenal bulb or second portion of duodenum.
There was fresh blood in the terminal ileum.
Mesenteric Angiogram [**8-17**]: WET READ - Diagnostic angiogram performed in the celiac trunk, [**Female First Name (un) 899**] and SMA reveals no evidence of extravasation of contrast to suggest a localizable focus of GI bleed.
CT abd ([**8-17**]): 3.5-cm enhancing soft tissue mass in the left upper quadrant mesentery, appears to bulge into the lumen of the splenic flexure of the colon, possibly into adjacent small bowel loops in the left upper abdomen.
Small bowel adenocarcinoma or lymphoma are considered much less likely.
MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2116-8-19**]):    No MRSA isolated.
On afternoon of HOD1, he had vasovagal episode.
Underwent an urgent colonoscopy due to amount of large bloody BM's.
C-scope performed by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 2987**] revealed bleeding from ostia of terminal ileum indicating a small bowel source.
He then underwent a tagged red blood scan, and found to have bleed on LUQ.
On morning of HOD2, pt underwent a mesenteric angiogram where [**Female First Name (un) 899**], SMA, & celiac access were injected.
Pt continued to have bloody BM's although hemodynamically stable.
CT of ABD performed to look for other bleeding sources.
The segment of jejenum where the GIST was located was resected and an extracorporeal primary stapled anastamosis was performed through a mini-midline incision.
Of note, pt received a total of 13 units of PRBC pre-op, and no transfusion post-op.
