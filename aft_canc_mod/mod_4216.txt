Admission Date:  [**2153-2-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-2-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2101-7-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Ampicillin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: Found down  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 51 year old male with h/o hepatitis C and head and neck CA currently receiving chemo and radiation was found by his sister today to be confused and complaining of chest pain.
He had a fever and was given 1 gram of vancomycin and 100mg of Gent for presumed sepsis.
CT torso revealed a splenic infarct as well as infarct of the mesenteric vessels.
CT torso showed splenomegaly and wedge shaped infarcts in the the spleen and kidneys.
On the floor, patient appears comfrotable breathing on the ventilator.
Past Medical History: # Hepatitis C, # Head and neck cancer, with likely lung involvement - currently receiving chemo and radiation # neuropathy, # Charcot [**Doctor Last Name **] tooth, # History of heroin abuse, # ?
staph sepsis, # pancytopenia, # lumbar back pain   Social History: IV drug user.
Family History: mother breast ca   Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 98.5 BP: 98/61 P: 93 R: 18 O2: 97% AC 530 x 12 PEEP 5 FIO2 50% CVP 12 General: Intubated, appears comfortable HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, pupils reactive 3->2 bilaterally Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly SKIN: bilateral LE petechaiea Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, but 1+ bilateral pedal edema   Pertinent Results: CT HEAD FINDINGS: Again seen is subarachnoid hemorrhage along the right hemisphere.
This may just represent extension of subarachnoid hemorrhage around a perivascular space or extension superiorly from the choroidal fissure.
Additional areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage are noted along the superior left parietal and frontal lobes, stable.
No clear intraparenchymal hemorrhage is noted.
There is no significant mass effect.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of right-sided subarachnoid hemorrhage along the entire right hemisphere.
Smaller areas of left-sided subarachnoid hemorrhage also relatively stable.
No evidence of intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: Evaluation is limited due to the respiratory motion throughout the entire exam.
Evaluation for pulmonary embolism is especially limited given motion and timing of contrast bolus.
However, there are no large main pulmonary artery pulmonary embolisms.
Multiple small pulmonary nodules are noted bilaterally in a far peripheral distribution measuring up to 9 x 5 mm (4:92).
There is no pneumothorax or focal areas of consolidation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is no hilar, mediastinal or axillary  lymphadenopathy.
There is no aortic dissection.
Gynecomastia is present.
Multiple areas of wedge-shaped hypoattenuated defects are present, most consistent with multiple splenic infarcts.
Similarly, the kidneys bilaterally also demonstrate multiple peripheral wedge-shaped areas of hypoattneuation.
There is no free air or free fluid.
There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
A small amount of free fluid is noted within the pelvis.
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
The arterial vasculature appears normal without evidence of vasculopathy.
Although evaluation is limited as this is not an arterially timed phase and there is significant motion artifact, no occlusion is noted within the visualized abdominal and pelvic vasculature.
BONE WINDOWS: Degenerative changes are noted throughout the visualized spine, most prominent at L5-S1.
Mild anterior loss of height of T11 and T12 of unknown chronicity.
Multiple, small, peripheral nodules within the lungs.
Given appearance and distribution of these nodules, diagnostic consideration favors septic emboli.
Multiple areas of wedge-shaped hypoenhancement within the kidneys bilaterally and throughout the markedly enlarged spleen.
These findings are concerning for infarcts in the kidneys bilaterally and spleen.
Given findings in items number 1 and 2, septic emboli causing infarcts is a possibility.
Thickening of the ascending colonic wall, concerning for an infectious or ischemic process.
TTE The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: Moderate aortic valve vegetation and tricuspid valve vegetation.
Stable appearance of the liver with no new intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
Stable perihepatic ascites and massive splenomegaly measuring up to 20.6 cm.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-2-15**], the degree of TR and pulmonary hypertension detected have increased.
There is no evidence of bowel distention.
There is no evidence of focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
The pre-existing areas of atelectasis have mostly cleared.
No evidence of newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
No evidence of larger pleural effusions   Brief Hospital Course: 51 year old male with h/o hepatitis C and head and neck CA was found by his sister to be confused and complaining of chest pain found to have endocarditis (aortic, tricuspid), MSSA Bacteremia, SAH, multiple septic infarcts to brain, liver, spleen, kidneys with hospital course complicated by DIC, acute renal failure requiring CVVH, and C.difficile associated disease, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
# ENDOCARDITIS, SEPSIS, SEPTIC EMBOLI: He was admitted to the MICU for further management.
Imaging demonstrated multiple infarcts in the spleen, kidneys, lungs, liver, and brain consistent with septic emboli.
The patient develpoed renal failure (see below) Repeat TTE one week after the initial ultrasound demonstrated new severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Repeat cultures following treatment for MSSA bacteremia were negative.
Ultimately, the patient developed renal failure and liver failure.
Given the patient's multi-organ decline and poor prognosis a family was held and the patient was made CMO.
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE.
He developed anuric acute renal failure likely from combination of sepsis in low flow state with third-spacing, multiple likely septic renal infarcts, and possibly possible dye load.
Despite this he remained anuric with deterioratig renal function.
Given the patient's multi-organ decline and poor prognosis a family was held and the patient was made CMO.
# LIVER FAILURE.
The patient has known underlying liver disease secondary to HCV and alcoholism.
He was not considered a transplant candidate given his ongoing substance abuse problems and active infection.
There was no evidence of acute bleeding.
Given the patient's multi-organ decline and poor prognosis a family was held and the patient was made CMO.
#C.DIFF ASSOCIATED DISEASE: He complained of abdominal pain and had bowel wall thickening on imaging.
# SAH/?left basal infarct: The patient was noted to have small SAH on imaging.
Repeat imaging on [**2-16**] showing continued interval slight decrease in density of SAH since earlier in the day.
The patient developed troponin leak in the setting of respiratory distress/agitation.
This was felt to be most likely related to demand ischemia.
