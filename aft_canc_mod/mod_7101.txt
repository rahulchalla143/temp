Admission Date:  [**2109-8-5**]       Discharge Date:  [**2109-8-24**]  Date of Birth:   [**2050-4-3**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Transplant Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59-year-old male with end stage renal disease who has been on peritoneal dialysis since [**2106-7-8**].
The patient was initially diagnosed with chronic renal failure in [**2095**] after returning from a trip from abroad and having experienced three days of anuria.
His renal failure was thought to be secondary to an infection.
The patient began hemodialysis on [**11/2099**], but because of difficulties in obtaining an adequate AVF, his dialysis was changed to peritoneal dialysis.
The patient also has a history of bladder outlet obstruction with multiple urethral dilatations previously performed.
Relative hypotension (70s to 90s systolic blood pressure for several years) 2.
Syncope x2 presumably secondary to hypotension 3.
End stage renal disease of unclear etiology, but most likely infectious 4.
Intermittent bladder outlet obstruction, status post multiple urethral dilatations.
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in [**2109-4-8**] 6.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease  MEDICATIONS: 1.
Nephrocaps  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.
ABDOMEN:  Obese abdomen, otherwise soft, nontender with peritoneal dialysis opening.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm, no edema.
The chest x-ray also showed satisfactory position of the endotracheal tube and the right IJ central line.
Cardiomegaly and bilateral atelectasis.
Chest x-ray obtained on [**2109-8-7**] showed continued widened mediastinum, bilateral atelectasis.
Chest x-ray from [**2109-8-9**] showed stable mild congestive heart failure.
Chest x-ray obtained on [**2109-8-14**] showed cardiac enlargement with evidence of mild congestive heart failure.
The exam also showed patchy atelectasis at the right lower lobe, but no evidence of pneumothorax.
Chest x-ray obtained on [**2109-8-15**] showed small right sided pleural effusion, as well as cardiomegaly with mild congestive heart failure.
Ultrasound of the bladder obtained on [**2109-8-17**] showed multiple clots within the bladder.
The renal transplant ultrasound obtained on [**2109-8-20**] showed mild hydronephrosis of the transplanted kidney, echogenic material in the collecting system of transplanted kidney which was thought to be consistent with blood clot, as well as mild elevation of the resistive index.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2109-8-5**], the patient underwent cadaveric renal transplant for chronic renal failure.
In addition, the patient was noted to have poor urine output which was thought to be secondary to ischemic damage plus the hypotension.
The patient had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed which demonstrated hyperdynamic hemodynamics and decreased systemic vascular resistance.
On postoperative day 1, the patient continued to have low urine output but it was slightly improved.
