Admission Date:  [**2174-2-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2174-2-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2095-4-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Enalapril / simvastatin / Niacin / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Nifedipine / omeprazole / amlodipine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2553**] Chief Complaint: SOB, thigh pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known lastname 72288**] is a 78yoF with h/o dCHF [**1-6**] cardiac amyloid, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation s/p DCCV in [**2173-3-5**], recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**], who presents back from rehab with right thigh pain, SOB, and hyponatremia.
During that admission, she had pulmonary edema with BNP very elevated at 16,166.
She was diuresed, but hypotension was an issue.
She was fluid restricted (1.0 L) for persistant hyponatremia to 120's.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.6 72 111/67 18 100% 3L Labs and imaging significant for labs with elevated BNP (20,000), CXR with pulmonary edema, and XR femur without pathologic fx.
She complains of right anterior thigh discomfort, but says it is improved.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - Progressive dyspnea and LE edema throughout late [**2172**] - [**2172-12-5**]: TTE concerning for restrictive physiology, pulmonary hypertension - [**2172-12-5**]: endomyocardial Bx positive for extracellular amyloid deposition and 30-40% plasma cells, skeletal survey positive for  multiple lytic lesions, SPEP with abnormal lambda band - [**2174-1-5**]: C1 bortezomib/dexamethasone started with weekly dosing .
CARDIAC HISTORY: - Acute on chronic diastolic CHF - Atrial fibrillation (d/c DCCV [**2173-3-5**], on coumadin) 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ESOPHAGEAL REFLUX ANEMIA - IRON DEFIC, UNSPEC HYPOTHYROIDISM ARTHRITIS   Social History: Patient is a widow and lives alone in [**Location (un) 1411**] MA.
Sclera anicteric.
No thrills, lifts.
Bilateral crackles in all lung fields, with some wheezes in the base.
No HSM or tenderness.
No femoral bruits.
Mildly tender to deep palpation on right anterior thigh.
Cardiomegaly is again noted with mild pulmonary edema.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions which appear similar to prior study.
No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, mild pulmonary edema.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
No definite sign of disease in the right femur.
Degenerative disease at the right knee is noted, tricompartmental with meniscal calcification suggesting chondrocalcinosis.
No joint effusion.
IMPRESSION: No fracture or definite evidence of multiple myeloma in the right femur.
The right peroneal and posterior tibial veins demonstrate color flow.
Subcutaneous edema is noted.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for DVT.
PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Mild cardiomegaly is increased compared to the prior exam.
Bilateral interstitial edema is improved.
New focal nodularity particularly within the left lung are concerning for disseminated infection.
Prominence and some minimal opacification at the right lung base may represent atelectasis or worsening pulmonary edema, although infection cannot be entirely excluded in the correct clinical setting.
Interstitial edema is improved compared to the prior exam.
Mild cardiomegaly is increased compared to the prior exam.
Focal nodularity predominantly in left lung, new since the prior exam, is concerning for disseminated infection.
The mediastinal, axillary and hilar lymph nodes do not meet size criteria for pathology.
The main pulmonary artery measures 3.1 cm, concerning for pulmonary hypertension.
Coronary artery calcifications are noted.
Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted within the arch of the aorta.
Centrilobular nodular branching opacities are noted in bilateral lungs, left greater than right, consistent with bronchiolitis.
Overall findings may represent airway secretions with widespread aspiration complicated by bronchopneumonia or diffuse airway infection due to viral or mycoplasma infection.
Bilateral pleural effusions are identified, right greater than left, with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Ground-glass opacity and minimal septal thickening is also noted in both lungs which may represent pulmonary edema.
Left superior segment bronchus appears obstructed which may be secondary to secretions.
This study is not optimized for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
Visualized osseous structures show no focal lytic or sclerotic lesions suspicious for malignancy.
Diffuse bronchiolitis and early bronchopneumonia which may be secondary to viral or mycoplasma infection.
Cardiomegaly and mild hydrostatic pulmonary edema.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with adjacent atelectasis.
Main pulmonary artery measures 3.1 cm, raising the possibility for pulmonary hypertension.
In comparison with study of [**2-8**], there is continued enlargement of the heart with evidence of vascular congestion.
However, the diffuse areas of pulmonary opacification bilaterally have substantially reduced.
There is, however, some opacification in the retrocardiac area with possible air bronchograms, raising the possibility of a lower lung pneumonia.
There is a pleural effusion most likely at the left base, though there may be a small effusion on the right as well.
**FINAL REPORT [**2174-2-9**]**    URINE CULTURE (Final [**2174-2-9**]):    NO GROWTH.
**FINAL REPORT [**2174-2-9**]**    Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2174-2-9**]):       NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
A negative result does not rule out infection due to other L.       pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.
Brief Hospital Course: # Cardiomyopathy secondary to amyloidosis:  The patient was initially admitted for tachycardia and fevers.
Immediate cause of death due to congestive heart failure.
8. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: One (1) puff Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Tessalon Perle 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO three  times a day as needed for cough.
