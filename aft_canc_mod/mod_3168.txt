Admission Date:  [**2195-12-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2196-1-8**]   Service:  Thoracic Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83 year old female who was first noted to have a right upper lung mass on chest x-ray in [**2194-12-17**] as she was preoped for a coronary artery bypass graft.
A computerized tomography scan was done then and then repeated in [**Month (only) 205**] showing slight increase in this finding.
She had been complaining of shortness of breath on mild exertion and was unable to climb up a flight of stairs, denied any weight loss or hemoptysis.
Elderly woman in no apparent distress.
Abdomen, soft, nontender, no mass, no edema.
ASSESSMENT:  When first examined in the office she was taken for a short walk but was unable to climb a flight of stairs and developed shortness of breath with no wheezing.
Because of her severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, her comorbidities and age, it seemed that she would not be able to tolerate an extensive procedure.
It was also noted that she had a left lower lobe nodule which seemed benign on the computerized tomography scan and it was planned to remove that as well.
She underwent a right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and wedge resection of her right upper lobe mass and lower lobe nodule.
Although this was teated, she eventually had blood pressure as high as 200 systolic and at the same time because tachycardiac and developed respiratory failure.
She was intubated over night and then able to extubate with no difficulty the next morning.
It was unclear at that point what was the underlying etiology for this acute respiratory failure.
A similar episode occurred the next day requiring short-term intubation and at that point it became clear that the blood pressures were clearly associated with the occurrence of the respiratory failure and at this point chest x-rays also showed more clearly that she had developed congestive heart failure.
It was therefore thought that she was developing pulmonary edema secondary to hypertension and that she required tight blood pressure control.
To briefly summarize her postoperative course:   Neurological - Her pain was initially controlled with narcotics.
These were discontinued during her hospitalization and she developed a slight confusion.
Because of the fact that she developed congestive heart failure she was diuresed here aggressively, initially with a Lasix drip and Lasix intravenously and Lasix p.o.
Since she was not at home on diuretics and it seemed that prior to discharge that her volume status is at baseline, Lasix was discontinued on transfer to rehabilitation but this should be again re-evaluated clinically by primary care physician and the cardiologist on follow up.
She has not developed any significant arrhythmias other than the tachy-arrhythmia around these acute events of respiratory failure and hypertension.
At some point during her stay here her creatinine had slightly bumped up to 2 secondary to aggressive diuresis.
Infectious disease - After her first episode which was of unclear etiology and occurred while the patient was sitting up and eating, and because of the thought that maybe aspiration was associated with an acute event of respiratory failure, we started her on Levofloxacin.
There was no further evidence that this was the case, we completed a course of one week's treatment around her acute events of respiratory failure, intubation, reintubation and extubation.
