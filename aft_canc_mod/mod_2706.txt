Admission Date:  [**2106-10-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2106-11-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2054-5-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 473**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Biliary Bypass Mesenteric Mass Biopsy Segmental Left Colectomy with Primary Anastomosis   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 60401**] is a 52-year-old gentleman who is status post Whipple procedure in [**2105**] for pancreatic cancer.
He is from [**Country 3399**] and over the month prior to admission, developed an increasing amount of abdominal pain and jaundice.
Prior to flying to the United States from [**Country 3399**], he developed fevers and had some amount of emesis.
He had decreased bowel movements.
A colonoscopy in [**Country 3399**] revealed an adenocarcinoma of his descending colon.
A CT scan was performed which revealed a mass just anterior to the aorta as well as a dilated afferent limb consistent with obstruction of that limb.
The working diagnosis prior to operation was recurrent tumor obstructing his afferent limb.
In addition, he has a colon mass which is intermittently bleeding.
There is no billiary, pancreatic or liver disease.
No known CAs.
CV: RRR, S1, S2, no murmurs GI: aoft, nondistended, +epigastric and RUq pain, no peritoneal signs, no [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign Ext: FROM all ext., no LE edema Skin: warm, no rashes  Pertinent Results: [**Numeric Identifier 49357**] CHANGE PERC TUBE OR CATH W/CONTRAST  [**2106-11-2**] 7:34 AM  Reason: biliary obstruction Contrast: OPTIRAY  CLINICAL HISTORY: Biliary obstruction.
The skin surrounding the skin exit site and tract were infiltrated with approximately 8 cc of buffered 1% Xylocaine for local anesthetic.
There is no extravasation of contrast.
No complications were encountered immediately.
Estimated blood loss was minimal.
INDICATION: 52-year-old with history of prior pancreatic cancer post-Whipple in [**2105**], history of colon cancer post-colonic resection several days earlier.
Now with obstructive symptoms and fevers, assess for afferent loop obstruction.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST: Consolidation at the left lung base has improved with atelectatic changes still present.
There is persistent consolidation of the right lung base, though somewhat improved from the prior examination.
Bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
Two small nodules measuring roughly 2-3 mm are seen along the right minor fissure.
The patient is post-Whipple procedure.
Mild left intrahepatic and central intrahepatic ductal dilation is present along with pneumobilia.
There is an old afferent loop of jejunum seen which does not contain oral contrast.
There has been creation of a new jejunal bypass loop from the region of small bowel where the biliary drainage catheters terminate, coursing superiorly and anteriorly in the transverse mesocolon just posterior to the transverse colon, and apparently anastomosing in the region of the gastrojejunostomy.
Oral contrast material is seen in the stomach and coursing freely into more distal loops of small bowel.
Numerous enlarged lymph nodes seen in the peritoneum and retroperitoneum are unchanged.
The soft tissue mass anterior to the aorta is again visualized and not significantly changed.
There is no new intraabdominal fluid collection.
A small amount of free air is seen consistent with recent post- surgical status.
The left kidney demonstrates a delayed nephrogram and mild pelvic fullness.
It is visualized coursing inferior to the level of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and in the region of the soft tissue mass anterior to the aorta.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST: Patient has undergone interval descending colonic resection, with the anastomotic site seen in the left lower quadrant.
A tiny focus of air is seen in the bladder, likely due to recent catheterization.
There is no free fluid or pathologic lymphadenopathy in the pelvis.
Soft tissues demonstrate mild edema and stranding.
No obvious evidence of bowel obstruction.
No contrast is seen in the old afferent limb.
There are no dilated loops of small bowel.
Right lower lobe pneumonia.
Delayed nephrogram and mild hydronephrosis of the left kidney, likely due to functional ureteral obstruction due to lymphadenopathy in the retroperitoneum.
No significant change in the appearance of the soft tissue mass anterior to the aorta and inferior to the superior mesenteric artery.
No change in mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
I. Mesenteric mass (A-B):  Metastatic adenocarcinoma.
Margins     Proximal margin:         Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma:  Distance of tumor from closest margin:  20 mm.
Distal margin:         Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma:  Distance of tumor from closest margin:  25 mm.
Circumferential (radial) margin:         Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma:  Distance of tumor from closest margin:  41 mm.
Lymphatic Small Vessel Invasion:  Present.
Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the biliary tract, involving the colon (transmural), mesenteric mass and pericolic lymph nodes.
Immunostains of the colonic tumor (slide E) are strongly positive for both cytokeratins CK-7 and CK-20, with satisfactory controls.
This immunoprofile supports that the carcinoma is a metastatic biliary tumor rather than a primary colonic lesion.
Note: The synoptic report for colon tumor (see above) is rescinded.
Considering both the gross and histologic features, it is not possible to completely distinguish whether the colonic tumor is primary or metastatic.
[**Doctor Last Name **]/hg Date: [**2106-11-5**]    C1894 INT.SHTH NOT/GUID,EP,NONLASER  [**2106-10-25**] 9:28 AM  Reason: place internal/external PTCs to decompress biliary tree.
th Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 52M with likely recurrent pancreatic cancer causing obstructive jaundice & cholangitis   PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: After injection of 5 cc of 1% lidocaine, and using a 21-gauge needle that was introduced into the tenth intercostal space in the mid axillary line in the right abdomen, access was gained into the biliary duct from the right side, after injection of contrast material.
Cholangiogram was performed, demonstrated dilation of intrahepatic biliary system, patent hepaticojejunostomy anastomosis, but markedly dilated bowel loop.
The catheter was secured to the skin, connected to the bag and opened for external drainage.
There were no immediate post-procedural complications.
Intrahepatic dilation of the biliary system.
Patent hepaticojejunostomy, but markedly dilated bowel loops.
The liver is diffusely coarsened without focal lesions with the exception of a small simple cyst in the lateral left lobe.
There is intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and marked dilatation of the extrahepatic common duct measuring up to 1.4 cm, extending into a large cystic lesion which appears to be obstructing the extrahepatic common duct.
Per report from outside hospital CT, this represents large necrotic nodal mass in the peripancreatic region, though it is difficult to distinguish from obstructed, nonperistalting small bowel at the anastomotic site on this ultraound.
Right kidney demonstrates no evidence of hydronephrosis.
IMPRESSION: 1) Large cystic mass vs. less likely dilated, nonperistalting bowel at the biliary enteric anastomosis causing biliary obstruction.
Per correlation with the report from the outside hospital CT from [**Country 3399**], there are large necrotic lymph nodes in this region, which may be secondary to recurrence of the patient's primary pancreatic cancer or metastatic disease from the patient's suspected colon cancer.
3) 1-cm echogenic lesion within the right kidney, likely an AML, but again see recent outside hospital CT for confirmation.
He presented with recurrent pancreatic cancer causing obstructive jaundice & cholangitis.
On [**2106-10-25**] He went for a Intrahepatic dilation of the biliary system and had a patent hepaticojejunostomy, but markedly dilated bowel loops.
A CT on [**10-26**] showed Abnormal soft tissue density mass in the pancreatic head surgical resection site, concerning for tumor recurrence.
It was decided to then proceed to the OR for resection of this mass and a right colectomy.
His pain was well controlled with an epidural.
An obstructed afferent limb, s/p Whipple procedure.
Pertinent Cultures: Blood cultures from [**10-25**] showed AEROMONAS SPECIES pan-sensitive.
Bile cultures from [**10-25**] showed ENTEROCOCCUS and from [**10-27**] showed ESCHERICHIA COLI and ENTEROCOCCUS.
Urine Cx from [**2106-11-2**] showed CORYNEBACTERIUM SPECIES (DIPHTHEROIDS).
