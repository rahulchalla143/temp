Her venous stasis has been constant for the past few years and has had no changes.
The new pain began three weeks ago as she was bending over to water her plants.
The pain began in the right side of her buttock and increased in severity over the past week.
She has noted the pain occurs when she applies pressure to her heels whenever she walks or stands.
Her pain goes from her heels to her knees to her hips and she describes it as sharp, shooting pain along the backs of her legs.
She has had no recent trauma.
She has no shortness of breath or recent travel.
Upon entry to the Emergency Room the patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation.
She has not had any recent change in her medications, no recent infections.
She does not have any symptoms such as chest pain or palpitations and she claims that her dose of Synthroid has been constant for years.
General appearance, the patient is a well appearing, well nourished female in no apparent distress.
There was no evidence of thrush.
The cardiac examination is significant for an irregularly irregular heart rhythm with normal rate, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Her abdominal examination had positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender and slightly distended.
Extremities showed no cyanosis or clubbing but there was bilateral lower extremity edema with brawny reddish discoloration and verrucous nodule.
She had a chest spiral computerized tomography scan with contrast which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus, mild emphysema, stable right upper lobe nodule, no lymphadenopathy, a high burden of aortic plaque with ulceration evident in the inferior portion of the thoracic aorta.
Her right hip film is positive for osteopenia, sclerotic changes of the lower lumbar spine, osteophytes of both hip joints, left greater than right, normal joint spaces and no evidence of fracture dislocation.
Her right lower extremity son[**Name (NI) **] showed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right common femoral, superficial femoral or popliteal veins.
Her chest x-ray showed marked kyphosis and compression fractures of the thoracic vertebra and no evidence of heart failure, focal pulmonary opacities or pleural effusions.
In short there was no acute cardiopulmonary disease.
Her electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 91 beats/minute, normal axis and intervals and T wave inversions in V4 through V6, 1 and AVR.
The patient was also ruled out for myocardial infarction times three.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was significant for several other films to look for fracture or arthritis.
Her computerized tomography scan of the hips showed an alar fracture from the anterior to the inferior portion and her computerized tomography scan of the lumbar spine showed diffuse osteophyte formation, especially prominent in the L4, L5 area.
Orthopedic Surgery was consulted and suggested that the patient's pain was most likely due to sciatica.
For her pain control, the patient was given Vioxx at the beginning of her hospital stay.
For her atrial fibrillation the patient had an echocardiogram which revealed normal left ventricular function, size and ejection fraction greater than 55%.
She showed no signs of failure but trace regurgitation in the tricuspid, mitral and pulmonary valves.
The patient also had a TSH done which came back as normal and a free T4 which was also normal.
For her history of non-Hodgkin's disease the patient had a staging computerized tomography scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis.
She also had studies sent to evaluate her anemia and thrombocytopenia.
Her anemia is significant for hypochromia 1+ and histiocytosis 1+, poikilocytosis 1+ and macrocytosis 3+.
Her reticulocyte count was slightly above normal at 3.3% and her iron was low with a low TIBC and transferrin.
During her hospital stay the patient became extremely sedated after Percocet and Droperidol for nausea and had an arterial blood gases done which showed a pCO2 of approximately 80.
During this entire process the patient did not complain of shortness of breath.
Pelvic fracture 3.
Atrial fibrillation 4.
