Admission Date:  [**2151-9-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-9-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-4-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IVC filter removal  History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 86028**] is an 84-year-old woman recently diagnosed with stage 4 renal papillary carcinoma (not yet started treatment) and at that time found to have bilateral PEs.
Further work up demonstrated extensive bilateral lower extermity DVTs.
On [**9-14**] the patient reported urinary vs vaginal bleeding on anticoagulation.
At this point anticoagulation was stopped and her bleeding resolved.
The procedure was felt to be a success but the patient was experiencing increasing exertional SOB since the procedure ans so she presented to the ED today.
Patient was placed on a heparin ggt and sent to the cardiac cath lab for percutanous removal of the IVC filter.
Past Oncologic History: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 86028**] is an 84-year-old healthy woman who presented approximately 2 years ago for a 2-cm right complex renal cysts.
She was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**7-25**] and underwent CT imaging which reportedly revealed 2.2 cm right kidney cyst with no central enhancement, multiple pulmonary nodules and a L5 lucent lesion.
Repeat CT scan in [**7-27**] was then performed and showed infiltrating mass involving most of right kidney with extensive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
Radiology report stated that findings were C/W possible lymphoma, small lesions in liver.
[**2151-7-23**] Abd/Pelvis CT: Previously in the right kidney, there was a focal exophytic slightly complex lesion, but there is now a diffuse infiltrative mass of much of the right kidney.
The diffuse infiltrative component, which extends through the cortex of the renal hilum and involves the hilar fat as well as circumferential the vessels of the renal hilum, is new.
Also new is extensive retroperitoneal and retrocrural lymphadenopathy.
A left adrenal lesion is stable.
The findings are unusual for renal cell carcinoma, the presumptive pretest pathology.
The appearances would be much more suggestive of lymphoma, possibly a transitional cell carcinoma, with atypical infection considered extremely unlikely.
[**2151-8-12**] Bx of right kidney mass showed papillary carcinoma diffusing infiltrating into the renal cortex and medulla.
Past Medical History: Osteoporosis Arthritis - s/p TKR bilaterally Pacemaker Right sided breast cancer [**2131**] - Underwent lumpectomy, treated with XRT and TAM x 5 years on ajuvant trial - Surveillance mammography is normal .

PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+  Pertinent Results: [**2151-9-23**] 12:05PM BLOOD WBC-15.4* RBC-3.60* Hgb-10.2* Hct-32.1* MCV-89 MCH-28.3 MCHC-31.8 RDW-15.0 Plt Ct-171 [**2151-9-23**] 12:05PM BLOOD Glucose-134* UreaN-53* Creat-2.4* Na-139 K-5.3* Cl-102 HCO3-19* AnGap-23* [**2151-9-23**] 12:05PM BLOOD proBNP-[**Numeric Identifier **]* [**2151-9-23**] 12:11PM BLOOD Lactate-2.0  Echo: There is a number of metal densities in the right ventricle, some likely representing the migrated IVC filter, however no further comments can be made regarding its precise position or interaction with the RV pacemaker lead.
There is no unusual metallic objects seen in the visualized portions of the IVC, RA (besides the pacer leads), or the proximal pulmonary artery.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion  CXR: IMPRESSION: 1.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 84F w/ renal papillary CA and known bilateral PEs not on anticoagulation [**3-18**] to hematuria s/p IVC filter placement on [**9-20**] presented with SOB and was found to have migration of IVC filter to RV.
# Pulmonary embolism/IVC filter migration - Patient has known bilateral PEs and had anticoagulation stopped due to hematuria with IVC filter placed on [**9-20**].
She had resolution of her symptoms following the procedure.
She had a cardiac echo that did not show any valvular damage and her pacemaker was interogated and found to be adequetly working.
While in the hospital she had no active bleeding.
# Chronic Kidney Disease - The patients creatinine was elevated to 2.4 on admission.
# Renal Cell Carcinoma - Not active during this hospitalization.
# HTN - The patient has a history of this.
She was continued on her home medications with the exception of her home lisinopril while in the hospital with no episodes of hypertension.
You came to the hospital because you were feeling short of breath.
You were placed on heparin for anticoagulation and monitored for several days.
Your blood count initally fell but then stablized without signs of bleeding.
You were discharged home without any of the shortness of breath.
Please Start: Lovenox 70mg daily  Followup Instructions: Please follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as scheduled for oncology.
