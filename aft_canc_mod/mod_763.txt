The CT showed a large right renal mass and he underwent nephrectomy on [**2147-6-6**].
His preoperative workup had revealed pulmonary emboli requiring anticoagulation.
CT scans following nephrectomy showed recurrence in the nephrectomy bed site as well as increased mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
He received HD IL-2 treatment in [**2147-9-1**]  without response.
Status post partial colectomy after perforated bowel secondary to a motorcycle accident.
History of pulmonary emboli on anticoagulation.

Segmental right middle lobe pulmonary artery pulmonary emboli.
Fluid-filled distal right lower lobe bronchus with associated atelectasis.
Focal ground-glass opacity within the right lower lobe which could represent either aspiration or early pneumonia.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2148-9-24**] 4:16 AM CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: RML AND rll atelectasis s/p significant time on Bipap; any i The right internal jugular line tip is in low SVC.
There is no interim change in the appearance of right middle and right lower lobe atelectasis.
There is unchanged basal atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
Small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
Mild-to-moderate interval increase in amount of intra-abdominal free fluid.
A few small pockets of hyperdense fluid along the anterior abdominal wall adjacent to incisional site are likely small postoperative hematomas.
Interval increase in size to a known invasive pancreatic head mass.
No significant interval change to retroperitoneal/right nephrectomy mass.
Interval placement of suprarenal IVC filter.
Probable bilateral, right greater than left, basilar atelectasis with areas of adjacent patchy ground-glass opacities.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2148-9-28**] 4:26 AM IMPRESSION: Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
Slight interval worsening in bilateral airspace opacities.
Diagnostic considerations again include pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: Pain: Chronic opioid user for pain, post-operatively the pt had severe abdominal pain, out of proportion to his abdominal exam, which remained relatively soft, although distended, throughout his hospitalization.
PE: On POD3, the pt developed acute dyspnea with tachypnea, requiring non-rebreather and CPAP to maintain adequate oxygenation.
He was transferred to the SICU, where his respiratory failure could be appropriately managed.
Once stabilized, a PE protocol CTA was done and demonstrated a segmental right middle lobe pulmonary artery pulmonary embolus.
The heparin drip was discontinued on POD15, and he was discharged without any anticoagulation due to the risk of bleeding from the pancreatic tumor.
Elevated glucose: Throughout his hospitalization, the pt had elevated blood glucose measurements between 100-200mg/dl.
ID: Intraoperatively, there was some stool spillage into the abdomen so the pt was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics.
After spiking a fever on POD___, antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and zosyn.
Throughout the remainder of the hospitalization, the pt remained afebrile on vanc/zosyn and this regimen was continued for the duration.
GI: [**Name (NI) **], pt had a prolonged ileus.
He was transitioned to full liquids on POD14 after having a successful bowel movement, and on POD15 he did well with a regular diet and his TPn was weaned off.
