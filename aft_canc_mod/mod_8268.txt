Admission Date:  [**2153-7-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-8-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2076-5-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Cipro / Codeine / Shellfish  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: abdominal pain   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation; blood product transfusions  History of Present Illness: 77F with history of Crohn's disease, multiple myeloma, anemia requiring multiple prior tranfusions, who initially presented to OSH with fevers and suddent onset of bilateral lower abdominal pain x1 day.
Has had nausea/heaving but no actual emesis, no diarrhea.
At the OSH, non-contrast CT was concerning for a possible mass in the pancreas/duodenum, as well as possible perforation (extraluminal gas noted).
Labs notable for neutropenia with WBC 0.3 (16%N, 1 band, ANC 51), Hct 38.3, plt 61, Na 146, K 2.6, CO2 11, Cr 1.1 (baseline unknown), Ca 6.2, mag 1.1, trop 0.03.
Repeat CT abd/pelvis here (on prelim read) showed [**Last Name (un) **] non-hemorrhagic free fluid in abdomen and pelvis w/ periportal edema, abnormal appearance of the ileocecal junction and proximal colon, significant wall thickening and inflammation suggestive of colitis, distal terminal ileum with minimal wall thickening, and a fluid-filled dilated appendix (14 mm) with surrounding inflammation (most likely reactive inflammation from primary process involving proximal colon).
There was no extraluminal air or oral contrast to suggest perforation on prelim read.
Patient was seen by Surgery, who reviewed imaging and felt it was c/w severe colitis, but that there was no evidence of free air/perforation or acute surgical pathology.
While in ED, she was tachy to the 150s-170s, unclear if sinus tachy vs. SVT.
Was question of tube being curled on CXR, but as it was still draining, was left in place.
Received fentantyl, dilaudid, and acetaminophen for pain control.
Patient was in considerable discomfort complaining of [**9-12**] abdominal pain.
Per her daughter's report (patient unable to provide due to pain) she has been having worsening of her chron's symptoms, specifically diarrhea and abdominal pain over the last month.
She was admitted to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] hospital in the end of [**Month (only) **] for abomdinal pain and was discharged on Lialda (a new medication) and a 14 day course of cipro/flagyl.
She developed nausea and vomitting while on these medications and self d/c'd the cipro.
She was readmitted to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**7-12**] with worsening abdominal pain and after out patient blood work demonstrated a K of 2.2.
She went back to the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**7-30**] after her daughter found her at assited living having not eaten, having nausea with vomitting and complaining of abdominal pain.
She is not sure when she began to have coffee ground emesis nor is she aware of any bloody bowel movements  Review of systems: (+) Per HPI, patient unable to relate other than nausea and abdominal pain.

**FINAL REPORT [**2153-8-25**]**     WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2153-8-25**]):    No significant growth.
Wall thickening and inflammation involving the distal ileum and proximal colon, as well as the appendix, most likely secondary to acute colitis related to known Crohn's disease and less likely due to typhlitis.
No evidence of perforation.
Fecalized duodenal diverticulum.
Stigmata of chronic Crohn's disease in the RLQ with fibrofatty proliferation.
Moderate to large amount of non-hemorrhagic ascites with mesenteric and periportal edema, findings consistent with shock physiology and recent aggressive volume resuscitation.
Delayed excretion of contrast from both kidneys, findings suggestive of acute renal failure, correlate clinically.
CXR [**2153-7-31**]: IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process  TTE [**2153-8-7**]: The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**12-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Borderline left ventricular systolic function.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Biventricular systolic function has substantially improved.
No more than mild functional TR is now seen, likely as a consequence of the smaller RV cavity.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The mitral E wave velocity spectrum actually represents E and A wave superimposition secondary to tacycardia.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Tachycardia is present.
No definite vegetations seen  CXR [**2153-8-26**]: Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to [**2153-8-24**].
There is interval development of widespread parenchymal opacities in the right lung and the left upper lobe, concerning for widespread infection.
Asymmetric pulmonary edema would be another possibility.
Brief Hospital Course: 77F with multiple myeloma, Crohn's disease, chronic pancytopenia, presented [**7-31**] with neutropenic fever, septic shock in the setting of a presumed Crohn's flare complicated by respiratory failure and prolonged intubation.
#Respiratory failure: Pt intubated on the day of admission [**7-31**] for respiratory distress.
On the morning of [**8-26**], her O2 requirement increased, urine output decreased and she developed bilateral infiltrates on CXR concerning for infection or ARDS.
#Sepsis: The patient presented with neutropenic fever and shock requiring 3 pressors presumed secondary to sepsis from GI source given signs of colitis on CT imaging.
She was also briefly on PO/PR vancomycin which was discontinued after multiple C diff assays were negative.
As above, she again developed signs of sepsis on [**8-26**] from presumed pulmonary source given poor oxygenation and diffuse bilateral infiltrates on CXR and broad antibiotic coverage was restarted.
The possibility of tracheostomy and PEG placement were discussed with planned possible discharge to LTACH, but the patient developed fungemia before this was pursued.
In the setting of her acute clinical deterioration on [**8-26**], a family meeting was held during which it was decided to transition her to comfort care and she expired that afternoon.
They also requested a DNA sample and pathology agreed to hold tissue blocks from the autopsy as well as a blood sample card.
She had hemoccult positive, occasionally maroon colored stools thought to be secondary to ischemic colitis vs Crohn's flare.
#Colitis: Pt was followed by GI and started on high dose IV steroids for presumed Crohn's flare with slow taper (5mg/wk).
#Edema: Pt became anasarcic with fluid resuscitation for sepsis.
Diuresed briefly with lasix drip after which she showed brisk auto-diuresis with improvement in appearance of edema and return to near baseline weight.
#Thrombocytopenia: Likely multifactorial, related to underlying marrow suppression, antibiotics.
Unlikely DIC given normal fibrinogen, unlikely HIT given slow downward trend.
#Ileus: Pt had profuse, bilious output from NG/OG and was started on Erythromycin for gut motility with some improvement.
#HTN: Pt intermittently hypertensive to SBP 150s-170s and tachycardic to 110s.
It was likely due to pain or agitation as it often related suctioning or repositioning especially when off sedation.
Pain was managed with fentanyl boluses, agitation managed with olazepine and midazolam.
#ELEVATED INR: INR noted to be elevated to peak 1.9, likely due to combination of poor nutrition and antibiotic therapy.
#Neutropenia:  Chronically low secondary to multiple myeloma.
As above, multiple goals of care discussions were held with family given poor prognosis with eventual decision to transition to comfort care.
Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Sepsis, hypoxemic respiratory failure.
