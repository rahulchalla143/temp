Family History: Hypertension, no malignancies  Physical Exam: Tc 96.1, BP 105/57, HR 90, RR 19, SaO2 96%/NRB (15 L O2), pulsus approximately [**3-28**] General: older female in mild respiratory distress, able to complete full sentences, +NRB in place HEENT: NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI.
+NRB mask Neck: supple, flat JVP Chest: shallow, decreased BS throughout with scattered rhonchi.
CV: RRR no m/g/r, good heart sounds Abd: soft, NT/ND, NABS Ext: 1+ pitting edema b/l   Pertinent Results: CT chest [**12-25**]: 1.
Large left pneumothorax and small right apical pneumothorax are new since [**2151-10-3**].
Moderate bilateral lung colapse, moderately worse since 9/[**2151**].
Small bilateral pleural effusions, slightly increased since 9/[**2151**].
Widespread skeletal involvment of multiple myeloma, unchanged since 9/[**2151**].
No other acute changes.
[**12-25**] CXR #1 - FINDINGS:  There is a new left-sided pneumothorax seen in the left upper lobe compared to the previous examinations.
A large right hilar opacity is consistent with the previously seen hilar mass as reported on the previous CT.
Bilateral pleural effusions are slightly increased in size compared to the most recent chest x-ray.
There is bibasilar atelectasis.
[**12-25**] CXR # 2 - There is essentially no change in the left-sided pneumothorax.
Since the previous chest x-ray, there is a new linear opacity in the right hemithorax of unclear etiology.
It appears to represent a pneumothorax on the right.
No discernible lung markings are identified outside this linear opacity.
No pneumothorax was present on the chest CT.
There are large bilateral pleural effusions.
There is bibasilar atelectasis.
[**12-30**]: CXR  Interval decrease in right pneumothorax is demonstrated, which is almost invisible on the current study.
There is no change in the position of the two central lines on the right, with the double lumen catheter tip terminating in the right atrium about 5.5 cm below the cavoatrial junction.
The known hiatal hernia is again demonstrated projecting over the heart silhouette.
There is overall no change in the appearance of the cardiac silhouette and the rest of the lungs including the patchy opacities in the left base.
Extensive involvement of the skeletal structures by multiple myeloma is again noted.
Small bilateral pleural effusion is demonstrated slightly improved compared to the previous study.
[**1-4**]: CXR   In comparison with the study of [**1-1**], there is no significant change.
Again, there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral pleural effusions, more marked on the right.
What appears to be a huge hiatal hernia is seen.
[**1-7**]: CXR  Interval development of a moderate-sized right hydropneumothorax.
Ill-defined linear opacity in the right mid lung field likely reflects atelectasis secondary to the hydropneumothorax.
Left small pleural effusion is unchanged.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette and retrocardiac air-fluid structure likely representing hiatal hernia are both unchanged.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Increased atelectasis involving bilateral lower lobes, and worsening hyperinflation of the right upper lobe.
No endobronchial lesion is identified.
Small right anteroapical pneumothorax.
Bilateral pleural effusion.
Diffuse permeative lesion within the osseous structures with areas of cortical destruction consistent with multiple myeloma.
Interval decrease in left-sided pneumothorax, which is now tiny.
Stable collapse with subsequent hyperinflation of a portion of the right lower lobe.
No evidence of right-sided pneumothorax.
Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions.
Large hiatal hernia containing stomach, bowel, and omentum, which may contribute to the significant bibasilar atelectasis.
Superimposed infection cannot be excluded at the lung bases.
Diffuse permeative osseous lesions consistent with multiple myeloma.
Findings suggestive of the possibility of chronic colitis.
Findings suggestive of chronic cystitis.
Bibasilar atelectasis and pleural effusions.
A large hiatal hernia containing the entirety of the stomach as noted above.
colonoscopy [**1-28**] Findings:  Mucosa: The colonic mucosa was hyperemic with increased vascularity throughout but with a predominance on the left.
Impression: Abnormal vascularity in the colon (biopsy) Internal hemorrhoids Otherwise normal colonoscopy to terminal ileum Recommendations: Return to hospital [**Hospital1 **].
Additional notes: Although the colon was hypervascular as noted above, there was no evidence of colitis or obvious source of bleeding identified.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 63 y/o female with progressive MM, systemic amyloidosis, CKD on HD, p/w spontaneous b/l pneumothoraces and respiratory distress.
# Respiratory distress - both hypoxic and hypercarbic, [**2-26**] secondary spontaneous PTX.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was intubated upon arrival to the MICU and had a BAL performed which showed no evidence of PCP or bacterial infection.
She subsequently received a four day course of chemotherapy and on [**1-7**] developed worsening shortness of breath and desats to mid 80s with ambulation.
Pleural cultures was negative for bacterial or fungal infection.
However over the course of the evening had an increasing O2 requirement and hypotension with systolics to the 70s and she was transferred to the ICU.
No evidence of PE on CTA.
Upon return to the floor, she continued to have an O2 requirement of 4-5L to maintain O2 sats as well as dyspnea on exertion.
On [**1-16**] she again developed acute shortness of breath and hypotension and was sent back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where she was found to have another pneumothorax.
Pulmonary consult team was following her and signed off on [**1-11**], a possible cause of her blebs and emphysematous changes that lead to her pneumothoraces is oligemic changes secondary to multiple pulmonary emboli.
She was discharged on coumadin for anticoagulation for her history of multiple DVTs and anticipation of thalidomide treatment.
# ID/hypotension/?sepsis: The initial fever had an unclear cause .
She was treated for presumed sepsis in the setting of hypotension with the antibiotics noted above which were discontinued without obvious source of infection.
Patient was initially treated with levophed for low BPs.
It was also reported by her nephrologist that she typically has SBPs in the 80s or lower while on dialysis but always mentates without evidence of hypoperfusion.
She had an ECHO performed which showed preserved systolic function and evidence of diastolic dysfunction and elevated filling pressures as previously documented and likely secondary to her cardiac amyloid or her history of poorly controlled hypertension.
After admission she had no further recurrence of her fever.
# CKD on HD - on HD T/Th/Sa, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**].
She received 10 mg of po midodrine prior to HD for relative hypotension and tolerated ultrafiltration well.
Phoslo was subsequently discontinued as she had low phos levels.
# Anemia: Patient was found to have significant Hct drop on [**2151-12-28**] which was verified on repeat.
She had no evidence of bleeding.
It was thought that this drop was potentially secondary to decreased production from marrow suppression and dilution in the setting of volume expansion.
She reported crampy abdominal pain the day before but denied nausea, vomiting or epigastric pain.
It was felt that her lower GI bleed was due to ischemic colitis as she had some episodes of hypotension.
However, in light of necessity of anticoagulation colonoscopy was performed and showed hypervascularity in parts of the colon but no obvious source of bleeding.
# Multiple Myeloma w/amyloidosis - s/p cycle 4 of velcade/cytoxan/decadron the day prior to admission.
# h/o multiple DVTs - has been on and off coumadin intermittently due to fluctuating platelet counts while on Velcade.
She remained on IV heparin until her lower GI bleed.
# HTN - Her anti-hypertensives were held due to relative hypotension .
Upon extubation she had some swallowing difficulties which gradually resolved.
# Access - PICC line, HD catheter, 20-g PIV   Medications on Admission: 1.
Chronic renal failure 4.)
Multiple myeloma 5.)
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because of shortness of breath and you were found to have pneumothoraces of both lungs (air between the lung and chest wall).
Because of diarrhea you had samples tested for infection - which were negative.
While you were on the heme/onc service you developed a lower GI tract bleed.
This is felt to be due to ischemic colitis.
Because you had chest tubes recently removed it is very important that you do not take a bath or immerse in water for at least 2 more weeks.
If you have any concerns that there is increased redness, swelling, or drainage from these sites, please seek medical attention.
