She was recently admitted to Caritas [**Hospital3 **] with shortness of breath, increasing abdominal distention, and diarrhea.
This revealed a large left pleural effusion.
There was a shrunken liver.
There was diffuse thickening of the transverse mesocolon suggestive of omental caking.
There was no retroperitoneal abnormality.
There was a right adnexal mass.
The cytology from the paracentesis subsequently revealed malignant cells consistent with ovarian origin.
A CA-125 was elevated at 505.
The patient has had recent unintentional weight loss of up to 50 pounds despite the increasing abdominal girth.
She has had some dizziness but denies any syncopal episodes.
She has had no headaches.
Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes, sleep apnea, bipolar disease, borderline personality disorder, arthritis, short-term memory loss, history of ethanol abuse with question liver disease, history of acute diverticulitis [**11/2133**], which was treated with antibiotics alone.
Last mammogram was [**8-/2134**] and revealed fibrocystic disease.
The patient also had a colonoscopy recently, which revealed evidence of diverticulosis, but no malignancy.
Family History: Significant for a brother with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer and four paternal cousins who have had breast cancer at young ages (one of these cousins tested positive for a [**Name (NI) **] mutation), mother with melanoma, a paternal uncle with melanoma, and a maternal aunt with breast cancer.
Physical Exam: GENERAL:  Well-developed, but clearly short of breath even at rest.
Heart was somewhat distant but without gallops or murmurs.
ABDOMEN:  Severely distended with obvious ascites.
There were no palpable masses.
The speculum examination was quite limited due to the patient's body habitus and abdominal distention.
There were no palpable pelvic masses.

However evaluation of the subsegmental braches is limited due to atelectasis.
No pericardial effusion is noted.
No pathologically enlarged central lymphadenopathy including mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymph nodes are visualized.
Moderate to severe left malignant pleural effusion is noted.
Thyroid contains a nodule in the right lobe.
The lung windows demonstrate complete collapse of the left lower lobe and the inferior part of the lingula.
The right lung is clear with no focal consolidation, pulmonary nodule or parenchymal opacification.
Incidental note is also made of omental caking within the anterior abdomen.
BONE WINDOWS:  The bone windows do not demonstrate any concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine is visualized.
No pulmonary embolism.
Evaluation of the subsegmental branches of the left lower lung is limited due to lung collapse.
Large malignant left pleural effusion and complete collapse of the left lower lobe and the inferior portion of the lingula.
Moderate ascites and omental caking.
Low precordial voltage.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
[**12-31**] Cell block from pleural effusion.
POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent with adenocarcinoma.
[**12-31**] CXR  There has been evacuation of the left-sided pleural effusion with residual atelectasis at the left base.
No pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax following left thoracentesis.
Brief Hospital Course: 49 yo G14P4-0-10-4 was admitted [**2134-12-30**] with shortness of breath with ascites and pleural effusions secondary to ovarian cancer.
She received thoracentesis and paracentesis status post admission with symptomatic improvement.
She was taken to the operating room on [**2135-1-4**] where she underwent exploratory laparotomy, drainage of ascites, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, subtotal abdominal hysterectomy, infragastric omentectomy and suboptimal tumor debulking.
Intraoperative findings were significant for [**1-30**] liters of straw-colored ascites, intraperitoneal carcinomatosis, studding with innumerable tumors measuring up to a centimeter, most prominently involving the right hemidiaphragm, the paracolic gutters, the small bowel and its mesentery, and the cul-de-sac, normal liver, no palpable retroperitoneal adenopathy, bulky disease involving the entire omentum extensively involving the transverse [**Month/Day (3) 499**] and mesocolon, bulky disease involving both ovaries with right ovary measuring about 8 cm and the left ovary about 4 cm, surface disease of uterus, bladder and peritoneum, uninvolved rectum.
At the conclusion of the debulking, the largest residual tumor was 1.5 cm, and there was diffuse intraperitoneal carcinomatosis.
- Neurologic.
The pt's pain was well controlled on a dilaudid pca.
- Cardiovascular.
The pt received aggressive intraoperative fluid hydration given drainage of ascites and predicted fluid shifts.
No evidence of hemorrhage was present.
The decreased Hct was determined to be from fluid shifts.
- Respiratory.
On postoperative day #2 a chest xray showed a large left peural effusion, mild to moderate R pleural effusion.
- Gastrointestinal.
The pt developed nausea and vomitting on postoperative day #3.
- Endocrinology.
- Genitourinary.
FeNa was consistent with intravascular depletion.
Fluid resuscitation was continued and urine output became adequate on postoperative day #1.
Creatinine became mildly elevated to 1.3 on postoperative day #1, but rapidly returned to [**Location 213**].
- Infectious disease.
There was concern for possible SBP preoperatively given leukocytosis on admission.
She otherwise remained afebrile and asymptomatic postoperatively.
- Psychiatry.
- Prophylaxis.
