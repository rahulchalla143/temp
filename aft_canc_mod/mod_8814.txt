The pt did not complain of any fever, chills, increased cough, chest pain, abd pain, melena, or hematochezia.
She was in acute resp distress and was intubated immediately and placed on CMV ventilation.
Propofol gtt was started for sedation, resulting in decreased BP to 70/42.

H/o GIB in the setting of coagulopathy and NSAIDs 10.
Eosinophilic pneumonia diagnosed [**4-22**], on chronic prednisone therapy.
Anemia [**2-20**] CRF 12.
Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia diagnosed in [**2113-4-18**].
COPD with PFTs with FVC 0.69 (27%), FEV1 0.46 (24%), FEV1/FVC 92%.
Vulvar squamous cell carcinoma in situ.
HEENT: anicteric, EOMI, PERRL, OP clear w/ MMM, no JVD CV: reg s1/s2, no s3/s4/m/r Pulm: coarse BS throughout, no wheezes or crackles Abd: obese, +BS, soft, NT, ND Ext: warm, 2+ DP B, no edema Neuro: pt too lethargic to cooperate; moving all extremities spontaneously and follows basic commands  Pertinent Results: Initial chest x-ray.
Findings consistent with severe pulmonary edema with possibly etiologies including congestive failure or, less likely, ARDS.
[**2115-12-4**] chest x-ray.
Resolution pulmonary edema  Initial chest CT.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There are no filling defects in the pulmonary arterial vasculature.
No pulmonary embolism is identified.
Some calcifications are seen in the coronary arteries, the aortic arch and descending aorta.
There is mild bilateral pleural effusion.
There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.
There is a precarinal 16 x 17-mm lymph node.
Interval increase in size in the spiculated mass located in the right upper lobe measuring now 34 x 24 mm concerning for lung cancer.
New extensive patchy areas of ground-glass opacities are seen throughout the lungs, mostly compromising the upper lobes .
BONE WINDOWS: There are no concerning bone lesions.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Diffuse ground-glass opacities through the lung parenchyma, concerning for PCP or pulmonary interstitial lymphoma with underlying probable lung cancer in the right upper lobe.
Bilateral pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 69 year old woman with HIV on HAART (last CD4 940), CHF (EF 50%) COPD, eosinophilic pneumonia, prior DVT and PE on coumadin, and ESRD on HD who presented to this hospital on [**11-28**] for 2 dyspnea and was found on arrival to be in acute respiratory distress.
Of note the patient also became hypotensive soon after a propofol drip was started for sedation.
The initial chest x-ray was concerning for PNA as diffuse interstitial infiltrates were visualized.
The pt was admittted to the MICU and was treated empirically with broad spectrum antibiotics along with hydrocortisone for possible COPD exacerbation.
It was believed that her respiratory distresss had a large component secondary to fluid overload which was treated by hemodialysis.
She underwent several rounds of ultrafiltration in addition to her regular hemodialysis which resulted in improvement of her volume status as evidenced by her improvement in respiratory status, her physical exam, and by resolution of pulmonary edema on chest x-ray.
Her course on the medical [**Hospital1 **] was complicated only by one episode of chest pain that was not associated with EKG changes and for which she ruled out for MI by cardiac enzymes.
As her admission INR was subtherapeutic, she was maintained on a heparin drip along with coumadin for her history of DVT and PE until therapeutic INR was reachieved.
In summary, this is a 69 year old HIV positive woman on HAART with CHF, COPD, ESRD on HD, and history of DVT and PE on coumadin who was admitted in respiratory failure, intubated briefly and treated empirically for pneumonia with broad spectrum antibiotics, for COPD exacerbation with steroids, and with hemodialysis for evidence of CHF exacerbation.
Her respiratory status satisfactorily improved with these treatments and it was felt that her presentation was largely secondary to volume overload from CHF exacerbation.
Pneumonia/Resp failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure now seems to have been from pulmonary edema from CHF exacerbation.
Contriubtion from pneumonia/reactive airway disease and eosinophilic PNA also possible.
- question PNA; although no source was identified, pan cultures were unrevealing, Pt received empiric 10 day course of levofloxacin, flagyl, and vancomycin (start [**11-28**]) - AFB smear negative, PCP negative [**Name Initial (PRE) **] serum CMV IgG positive, IgM negative suggesting no recent exposure.
Hypotension: Had brief pressor requirement, prior hypotensive episode likely secondary to propofal along with sepsis.
Now blood pressure nl without pressor requirement.
Pt with known CAD s/p p NSTEMI [**5-19**], s/p PTCA/stent LCX [**2113**].
CP now resolved, no EKG changes or new elevation in CE, pt was ruled out for MI.
ESRD on HD (M,W,F), her CHF exacerbation and fluid status were largely managed by hemodialysis and additional ultrafiltration sessions.
Eosinophilic PNA: CT findings suggestive of infection but different from previous studies.
No PE on CTA.
Prophylaxis included heparin/coumadin, protonix .
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual Q5MIN X 3 () as needed for prn pain: Take 1 pill for chest pain, if no relief after 5 min take another, if still no relief after 5 min take one more; seek medical attention.
Loperamide 2 mg Capsule [**Month/Day (2) **]: One (1) Capsule PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for diarrhea.
Congestive heart failure exacerbation.
Possible pneumonia Non cardiac chest pain.
Fluid overload R middle lobe mass in lung of unknown etiology  Discharge Condition: Good, breathing normally on room air.
Chest pain free.
Discharge Instructions: Please return to hospital if you start to experience chest pain or if you feel you it is gettting difficult to breathe.
Please continue to attend all of your hemodialysis regimen.
