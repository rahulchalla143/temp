was afebrile with adequate urine output.
A CXR [**6-20**] showed no free air effectively ruling out the possibility of a perforation during the ERCP.
Also [**6-20**] the pt underwent an MRCP that showed dilitation of intrahepatic ducts, nodular wall enhancement in the distal pancreas, a mass in the neck of the pancreas, and a large cystic lesion on the right kidney.
Furthermore, there appeared to be ductal dilation in the uncinate region as well as gross side branching in the distal part of the pancreatic duct.
This was all consistent with intraductal papillary mucinous tumor.
We knew from a pre-hospital brushing from [**State 531**] that he had adenocarcinoma harbored in this.
had a small bowel obstruction w/a clear transition point.
had become tachycardic and hypotensive.
developed a hematoma at the site of the central line.
An ultrasound was performed that showed no evidence of a pseudoaneurysm or AV malformation.
On pod 3 he developed hiccoughs that gradually resolved on their own.
He remained afebrile with stable vital signs.
