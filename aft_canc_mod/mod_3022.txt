He reports a mild cough with sore throat and hoarseness for the past couple of days, but otherwise review of systems is negative.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Metastatic [**Year (4 digits) 499**] cancer to the liver- possible candidate for trisegmentectomy with wedge resection (referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] secondary to rapidly progressing liver metastasis despite recent chemotherapy.
Status post sigmoid colectomy with low anterior resection on [**2178-9-23**] with one moderately differentiated and one poorly differentiated lesion with 11 out of 12 lymph nodes positive, status post adjuvant chemotherapy from [**11-9**] to [**6-10**] consisting of 5-FU plus leucovorin.
CEA on [**2179-9-27**] elevated to 29, at which time a CT revealed new large liver metastasis.
Mother deceased at 92 secondary to natural causes.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco or alcohol.
He denies IV drug use, blood transfusions, or hepatitis.
General:  The patient is clearly in distress secondary to pain, unable to move in the bed without complaints of pain.
Neck:  No lymphadenopathy.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen:  Normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended; no masses or hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
No complaints of weakness.
Increasing creatinine to 1.3 following episode of hypotension.
LFTs increased into the 1000s following episode of hypotension.
Troponin 0.16 following episode of hypotension.
Hepatitis B surface antigen positive, hepatitis B core antibody positive, hepatitis A virus antibody positive, hepatitis C virus antibody negative.
MRI of the spine: Metastatic involvement of T12 without pathologic compression or deformity.
Moderate cervical spondylosis most notably at C5-C6 level; also minor spondylosis at C4-C5 and C3-C4.
Loss of signal within the body of L1 with mild loss of height anteriorly and perhaps slightly posteriorly.
An epidural mass extending posterior to L1 without compression of the cauda equina.
Mild disc narrowing at L3-L4 and L4-L5 without evidence of canal stenosis or focal disc protrusion.
CT of the head from [**2179-10-30**]:  No acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or enhancing lesion.
Small lacunar infarct within right basal ganglia, likely remote.
Stool culture from [**2179-10-30**] and [**2179-11-5**] negative for Clostridium difficile and other cultures.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 60-year-old male with history of metastatic [**Month/Day/Year 499**] cancer to the liver presenting with acute worsening of chronic low back pain with evidence of metastatic spinal disease on admission MRI involving T12 and L1.
Metastatic [**Month/Day/Year 499**] cancer:  The patient is status post 5-FU and leucovorin completed in [**6-10**], however, with rapid development of liver metastases on CT diagnosed prior to admission.
He was prior in consideration for hepatic resection due to his single site of metastasis.
However, he now presents with new bony metastasis.
During the course of his admission, Surgery was consulted and the patient was staffed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], whom he was referred to in the past for liver lesion resection.
The decision was made that resection is not appropriate at this time given the two sites of metastatic disease.
Thus, Radiation Oncology was consulted with a plan to initiate palliative radiation for pain control.
Neurosurgery was consulted regarding the benefit of a potential brace.
It was their opinion that a brace will offer the patient little to no benefit.
Due to ongoing pain despite p.o.
However, this seemed to acutely worsen his back pain and his MS Contin was gradually titrated up.
However, this was complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure due to likely narcotic overdose plus or minus history of aspiration due to decreased mental status and supine positioning necessary due to the patient's ongoing back pain.
Epidural mass at L1:  On admission MRI, patient was noted to have an epidural mass at the level of L1 vertebral body without compression in the cauda equina.
He received IV steroids; however, these were discontinued the following day due to the confirmation of no cord compression, and the approval of Radiation Oncology for the absence of need for steroids with the initiation of palliative radiotherapy.
Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  The patient was noted to be unresponsive and hypoxic with saturations in the 80s on [**2180-10-30**].
Initial thought for narcotic overdose as the underlying etiology, thus the patient received one dose of Narcan with some improvement in his oxygenation and respiration.
However, he continued to be poorly responsive and agitated with a drop in his blood pressure following intubation, thus suspicious for sepsis secondary to possible aspiration pneumonia in the setting of narcotic analgesia and the patient's supine position, all necessary for control of his back pain.
Sepsis:  Following hypercarbic respiratory failure and unresponsiveness, the patient was intubated, at which time his systolic pressures dropped into the 70s.
However, the patient suffered shock liver with elevation of his LFTs into the 1000s; acute renal failure with bump of the creatinine to 1.3, which has subsequently improved; in addition to cardiac-demand ischemia and mild DIC.
Thus likely, the patient's sepsis is secondary to aspiration pneumonia.
Pathologic compression fracture.
Aspiration pneumonia.
Disseminated intravascular coagulation.
Acute renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis/hypotension.
Pain controlled.
