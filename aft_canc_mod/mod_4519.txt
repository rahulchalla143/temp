An abnormal population of events cluster within the blast gate.
INTERPRETATION Increased blasts with predominantly myeloid markers, consistent with acute myeloid leukemia.
Morphological review shows blasts (~58%) with high N:C ratio, rare Auer rods, scant paucigranular cytoplasm, irregular nuclear contours, and open chromatin.
Erythrocytes are decreased in number and are normochromic and normocytic with mild anisopoikilocytosis.
There is a predominance of large, immature forms with high nuclear cytoplasm ratio, scant agranular cytoplasm, prominent nucleoli and fine chromatin consistent with blast forms.
Erythroid precursors show normoblastic maturation with occasional megaloblastoid forms, irregular nuclear contours, and rare nuclear buds.
Megakaryocytes are present in decreased numbers; abnormal forms are seen and include small hypolobated forms.
Blasts comprise 62% of the aspirate and are large with fine chromatin, prominent nucleoli and scant cytoplasm.
Prominent aspiration artifact is present.
- [**7-14**] Cytogenetics: KARYOTYPE: 46,XY[20] INTERPRETATION: No cytogenetic aberrations were identified in 20 metaphases analyzed from this unstimulated specimen.
This normal result does not exclude a neoplastic proliferation.
Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the standard methods employed.
The white blood cell count appears markedly decreased and includes large immature myeloid forms consistent with blasts.
Lymphocytes include small mature and large reactive forms.
Aspirate Smear: The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation and is predominantly comprised of large atypical myeloid forms with one to several prominent nucleoli consistent with blasts.
The overall cellularity is approximately 40% and is comprised almost entirely of large blast forms present in large clusters.
The remainder of the cellular components are made up of lymphocytes, plasma cells and rare maturing myeloid and erythroid precursors.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
- [**7-14**] CXR:  No previous images.
There is some apparent hyperexpansion of the lungs suggesting some chronic pulmonary disease.
However, no evidence of acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
No evidenceof pneumothorax.
- [**7-20**] CXR: Aside from atelectasis in the left base the lungs are clear.
There are low lung volumes.
- [**2158-7-28**] CT chest/abd/pelvis: No abnormal interstitial lung process or site of infection identified.
Interval increase in number of mediastinal nodes extensively, but no single pathologically enlarged lymph node.
Limited CT examination due to respiratory artifact.
No proximal or segmental pulmonary emboli identified.
More distal branches obscured due to poor filling and breathing artifact.
Slightly increased linear atelectasis.
Unchanged small mediastinal lymph nodes of uncertain etiology.
Atherosclerotic calcification within the coronary vessels.
Small-to-moderate hiatal hernia.
Stable right-sided pulmonary nodules as detailed above; can be followed in six months as suggested on initial [**2158-7-24**] CT chest.
- [**2158-8-15**] CT abdomen/pelvis: Mild delayed right nephrogram with high-density filling defect within the posterior calices of the right upper pole, most consistent with underlying clot.
There is mild right hydronephrosis and proximal-mid hydroureter with abrupt cutoff of contras column in the mid-distal ureter.
This may reflect more distal intraureteral clot, although a focal obstructing lesion cannot be completely excluded.
Can consider correlation with follow up CT or further evaluation with dedicated MR urogram or ureteroscopy as needed.
-[**2158-8-16**] Bone marrow biopsy: MARKEDLY HYPOCELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH FEATURES CONSISTENT WITH CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCE MARROW ABLATION.
THERE IS NO MORPHOLOGIC EVIDENCE OF INVOLVEMENT BY ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA.
-[**2158-8-23**] Renal u/s: Mild to moderate right and mild left hydronephrosis.
-[**2158-8-24**] MRI C and T spine, brachial plexus: No abnormal cervical or thoracic spine enhancement.
-[**2158-8-26**] CT chest w/o contrast: Redemonstration of tiny pulmonary nodules as detailed above, the largest of which is approximately 5 mm.
-[**2158-8-27**] Bone marrow biopsy: Hypocellular marrow with erythroid dominant elements.
Diagnostic features of involvement by acute myeloid leukemia are not seen,  By immunohistochemical stains, CD34 reactive blasts comprised <5% of overall marrow cellularity.
E-cadherin expression is present in scattered clusters of early erythroid precursors, while Glycophorin A highlights numerous maturing erythroid forms.
-[**2158-8-28**] Urine cytology: Rare cluster of atypical but degenerated urothelial cells.
Brief Hospital Course: 66yo M w/ unrelated PMH presented to OSH, found to have pancytopenia w/ blasts in smear, transferred and found to have AML on flow cytometry and bone marrow biopsy.
# AML: Patient was admitted and found to be pancytopenic but asymptomatic except a chronic non-productive cough that was attributed to seasonal allergies.
He was thrombocytopenic and developed gingival bleeding with PLT in the 30s and was transfused as needed.
His counts gradually increased and antibiotics were discontinued, he had been on broad coverage with vancomycin, cefepime, and ambisome (spent a lot of time in [**State 15946**]) and remained on these antibiotics until he was no longer neutropenic or febrile.
Counts continued to increase and at the time of discharge pt was no longer neutropenic and WBC was 4.1.
Bone marrow biopsy on [**2158-8-28**] showed no clonal cytogenetic aberrations and <5% blasts.
However, skin biopsy for a purple-pink papular rash on both forearms with biopsy was consistent with leukemia cutis.
# Febrile Neutropenia: As counts decreased, the patient was febrile without obvious source in urine or lungs and was started on cefepime and vancomycin and levofloxacin which had been prescribed for cough was discontinued.
Given the concern for hemorrhoids and possible minor anal mucosal tear, see below, Flagyl was added.
He was placed on vancomycin, meropenem, and ambisome (for aspergillus and coccidiomycosis coverage).
He improved clinically and antibiotic coverage was stopped on [**8-26**] when patient had been afebrile for several days and ANC >1000.
These results are to be followed up as an outpatient and no antifungal coverage or liver/spleen imaging were advised unlses the he spiked a fever, which he did not do.
# Guaiac positive stool: Patient reported hard and painful BM during induction therapy.
Bloody streaks were seen on stool, minimal blood in toilet.
#hematuria: noted to have hematuria [**8-15**] in the setting of thrombocytopenia.
CT abd/pelvis showed mild R hydronephrosis and proximal-mid hydroureter on [**8-15**].
F/u ultrasound showed bilateral hydronephrosis in the setting of increasing creatinine, urology was consulted concerning the hydronephrosis and advised that he follow up as an outpatient for a hematuria workup.
#Thrombocytopenia: pt had low platelets as expected and was transfused PRN for platelets <10.
On [**8-20**], had urticarial reaction to crossmatched platelets that improved with tylenol, PRA assay positive.
Thrombocytopenia improved without intervention as the rest of counts went up as well.
#Acute kidney injury: Patient's creatinine was elevated starting [**8-24**] from baseilne of 0.9 to 1.8 on [**8-29**] despite removal of nephrotoxic vancomycin and ambisome on [**8-26**].
He did have a drug rash earlier in his hospital course, thought to be related to micafungin or meropenem, but it is unclear what caused the AIN.
No lesions on MRI and no evidence of CNS disease.
ICU Course ([**Date range (1) 29638**]) Hypoxia: Pt with increased O2 demand and some respiratory distress which lead to his brief transfer from the onc service to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Broad spectrum antibiotics were continued but elevated LFTs raised concern over the administration of fluconazole.
Because of the pts significant travel history to some fungal endemic regions it was determined to treat emperically with Ambisome so this was started and Fluconazole D/Ced.
Near the end of the first Ambisome infusion pt spiked a fever above 104 and had chills/rigors.
This calmed down with demerol and tylenol and was thought likely due to the infusion vs an infectious cause.
Pt had mild temp at time of beginning of the 2nd transfusion but it was administered in spite of this.

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Acute Myelogenous Leukemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 86903**], you were admitted to the [**Hospital1 827**] because you had low blood count.
We obtained a bone marrow biopsy which showed that you had acute myelogenous leukemia.
We treated you with many antibiotics.
While you white blood cell counts were at their nadir, you have difficulty breathing and spiked high fevers with rigors for many days.
We continued with medications to treat bacterial or fungal infections.
You eventually got better and did not have any more fevers and your white blood cell counts increased (including neutrophil count) and we stopped your antibiotics.
Your creatinine was increasing (number that shows kidney function), which we think is likely due to acute interstitial nephritis (allergic reaction in your kidneys likely from medications).
