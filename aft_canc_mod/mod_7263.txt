Since that time, she reports her symptoms have progressed.
She reports persistent nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, increased incontinence of bowel and bladder.
Of note, the patient has not allowed re-imaging of her disease since [**8-1**].
2 large bore IVs were place.
After signout was given, it was noted that the patient has a history of right main pulmonary artery invasion from the tumor, thus a CXR and CT torso was done to rule out bleeding into chest.

She had recurrence in [**2129-5-8**] with a left lung nodule.
Because of progression of disease by CT scan and rising CEA, she agreed to a trial of Tarceva which she began on [**3-/2134**], however, developed severe skin and mucosal reactions.
In [**1-31**], she was found to have right upper lobe collapse.

No HSM EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
Gait assessment deferred PSYCH: Listens and responds to questions appropriately, pleasant   Pertinent Results: EKG: sinus rhythm at 95bpm with AV conduction delay, no ST changes.
No evidence of hemorrhage within the torso, or other explanation for hematocrit drop.
Grossly stable appearance of multiple pulmonary masses, and post-surgical changes in the lungs, although limited in the absence of IV contrast.
No acute abnormalities in the torso.
EGD [**2137-12-30**]: Small hiatal hernia We did not see sign of post-gastrostomy.
Polyps in the stomach body Erythema in the antrum compatible with gastritis There was dark blood clot in her stomach body, which was easily dislodged by water flash.
There was no ulcer or visible vessel under the blood clot.
(thermal therapy) Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  Admission labs [**12-29**]:  WBC-7.3# RBC-1.66*# Hgb-5.4*# Hct-16.1*# MCV-97 MCH-32.3* MCHC-33.3 RDW-16.1* Plt Ct-325 Neuts-87.7* Lymphs-10.5* Monos-0.3* Eos-1.2 Baso-0.2 PT-20.1* PTT-26.9 INR(PT)-1.9* Glucose-121* UreaN-17 Creat-0.8 Na-137 K-3.5 Cl-102 HCO3-27 AnGap-12 ALT-14 AST-33 LD(LDH)-441* AlkPhos-52 TotBili-0.4 Calcium-8.4 Phos-3.4 Mg-1.9  Discharge labs [**1-1**]:  WBC-3.3* RBC-3.89* Hgb-11.7* Hct-35.1* MCV-90 MCH-30.2 MCHC-33.5 RDW-16.6* Plt Ct-191 Glucose-94 UreaN-10 Creat-0.8 Na-136 K-3.5 Cl-99 HCO3-28 AnGap-13 Calcium-8.6 Phos-4.0 Mg-1.8  Microbiology: H. pylori negative MRSA screen negative Blood cultures pending (negative to date)  Brief Hospital Course: 82 yo female with stage IV bronchoalveolar carcinoma, history of GIST, PEs on coumadin admitted for severe anemia likely secondary to GI bleed.
GI Bleed: Patient admitted with large Hct drop and history of melena.
She underwent EGD that showed a gastic lesion consistent with a likely dieulafoy lesion.
Additionally, the stomach mucosa was irregular, but no biopsy was performed at the time of endoscopy because of recent bleeding.
She had a couple guaiac positive stools but had a stable hematocrit.
The patient underwent CT torso in the ED given her history of known right main pulmonary artery invasion from the tumor.
However, no gross hemorrhage was seen in the chest cavity.
Per primary oncology team, the patient's history of PE was related to tumor compression of the pulmonary vasculature, and therefore there is no clear indication for anticoagulation in the future.
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor:  S/p resection in [**2121**] without known recurrence, but suspicious lesion was seen on EGD.
The patient was advised to undergo repeat EGD in 6 weeks for biopsy of gastric lesion.
Hypokalemia: Likely secondary to severe diarrhea.
Intially held home lasix due to risk of hemodynamic compromise, but restarted after fluid resuscitation.
Leukopenia and Thrombocytopenia: Decreased platelets could be consumptive process in setting of recent bleed but more likely related to recent chemotherapy administration.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Upper gastrointestinal bleed  Secondary: Non small cell lung cancer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive  Activity Status:Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you were having gastrointestinal bleeding.
You were seen by gastroenterology who performed who determined by a procedure called endoscopy that the bleeding originated in your stomach.
