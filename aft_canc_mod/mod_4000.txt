Her pain upon admission was [**8-7**], sharp.
Pt's pain was persistent despite PO decadron and XRT which was started in [**Month (only) 359**] at outside rad-onc.
Pt also reported progressive LLE weakness and urinary retention 2 days prior to admission.
MRI of spine at OSH showed compression at L5 and T7.
Of note, the patient did not have a BM since [**12-10**].
Sister reports that the patient has been having confusion since starting steroids on [**12-14**].
Past Medical History: Onc Hx:  Diagnosed in [**2155-6-29**] when she presented with a left renal mass on CT scan, undergoing nephrectomy with resection of metastatic lesions in the pancreatic tail and retroperitoneum.
In [**2156-6-29**] she developed hilar lymphadenopathy and was initiated on the Avastin/Tarceva trial in [**Month (only) **] with evidence of disease progression after 24 weeks.
She began SU11248 in [**2157-4-29**] with disease progression on CT scans in [**2157-8-29**] with new liver lesions  and progression and lumbar vertebral mets.
She received high dose IL-2; however, this was complicated by myositis and so dose was reduced.
Eventually developing symptoms of cord compression from vertebral mets and undergoing XRT to spine and decadron.

Increased size in left adrenal nodule concerning for metastasis.
New right adrenal lesion concerning for metastasis.
Pathological fracture of T7 due to metastasis with moderate spinal cord stenosis and mild to moderate spinal cord compression.
While most of the spinal stenosis appears to be due to bony metastatic disease, gadolinium enhanced study would help for further characterization, if clinically indicated.
Heterogeneous signal intensity within the T5 through T12 vertebral bodies concerning for metastatic disease in this patient with known renal cell carcinoma.
Focal isolated disc protrusions at C5/6, and C6/7 without spinal canal compromise.

Also symptomatic with urinary retention and worsening LLE weakness/pain.
Received decadron and XRT fpr spine compression at OSH w/o significant improvement.
# cord compression - bony mets with acute worsening of spinal compression as seen on MRI: T7 mild compression with retropulsion of vertebral fragments into spinal canal, moderate (50-75%) spinal canal stenosis, and soft tissue (tumor) and compression of left L5 root.
She was evaluated by ortho who felt that her symptoms were stable and improving on IV steroids.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Interventional Rads embolized L5 and T7 tumor on [**12-14**] to address increased vascularity, and then pt chose to have semi-elective laminectomy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] from orthopedics.
This was discussed w/ the rad onc staff here to ensure that she would not have problems w/ wound healing as she had recent XRT to these areas.
Following her spine surgery, she had an uneventful recovery w/o new fevers, n/v, dysphagia, headache, cp/sob/palpitations or abdominal pain.
She had a few days during which she could urinate, but then foley had to be re-inserted prior to discharge for urinary retention.
She also did not have a bowel movement for several days.
She worked w/ PT almost daily, and they felt that her progress waxes and wanes.
Her pain was well-controlled w/ her pre-admission dose of fentanyl patch and hydromorphone 2mg po q8prn.
She continues to have daily dressing changes at her surgical site - healing well.
# MS changes: the patient began to have visual hallucinations on the decadron.
She does not have an underlying psych d/o.
After discontinuing steroids, she noted having confusion after receiving ativan.
This was temporally related to ativan dosing; she reports a history of having MS changes after ativan.
Considered CT of head to r/o metastatic disease, but she was neurologically intact and remained mentally clear.
Also, thyroid function studies suggested that she has mild hypothyroidism; did not treat at this time as she continued to have tachycardia on small dose BB.
# Increased Temperature - Temp to 100.3 once after her surgery; afebrile since then.
Likely due to atelectasis as CTA did not support PE or pna.
Urine cx negative, and blood cx w/ no growth to date; catheter tip growing coag neg staph which is likely staph epidermidis.
Sweats likely related to her cancer, but not concerning at this time for new progression or mets.
# Tachycardia - Patient with ventricular bigemeny on EKG - has a history of this.
No chest pain or signs of cardiac failure.
# RCC - Has received maximum chemo and XRT.
She had some hematuria following surgery, but this was attributed to foley trauma.
Pt denies any discomfort.
# hypoxia/crackles on exam - this was first noted after the chemoembolization in the PACU.
CXR was only notable for bilateral atelectasis.
# low platelets/elevated INR - no schistocytes on smear, no renal failure or CNS symptoms or labs to suggest TTP, no DIC.
No signs of hemolysis.
# Anemia - Patient with significant blood loss during surgery.
# anxiety - has history of anxiety disorder.
Had been on effexor 75 qd and ativan 1mg q6 prn but she noted that she becomes confused on ativan.
Switched to xanax w/ resolution of her MS changes.
# Pain - controlled on fentanyl patch 100mcg q72hrs and dilaudid 2mg po q8 prn.
# Follow-up: Pt will call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for an appointment in the next few weeks.
