Since his last hospitalization ([**2115-5-17**] - [**2115-5-23**]) when he was admitted with pseudomonas and MSSA pneumonia and treated with 10 days of zosyn, he had initially felt relatively well until several days ago.
He notes that about one week ago, he noted a worsening cough productive of green sputum.
He also notes that he has been having worsening nasal congestion.
He notes chills, generalized weakness and fatigue.
Since his admission he was started on zosyn and vancomycin with improvement in his symptoms until the morning of [**7-5**] when he began having significantly increased frequency in his cough as well as increased sputum production.
He also began having hemoptysis (states it was the color of cranberry juice) which he had not had previously.
His O2 requirement increased from nasal cannula to a non rebreather and he was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for increasing O2 requirement.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he was noted to have a worsening pneumonia on cx-ray and was treated with aztreonam and zosyn for pseudomonas pneumonia.
His counts have also come up and he is now no longer neutropenic.
No N/V/D/C, abdominal pain.
No GU symptoms.
He was diagnosed with grade II follicular lymphoma in [**2112**] after presenting with lymphadenopathy of the neck.
His lymphoma was resistant to multiple courses of chemotherapy, and he then underwent transplant in [**2114**].
While on antibiotics after extractment, he developed rashes, which were felt to be secondary to GVHD or drug-related.
He also had several bouts of CMV viremia with colonic involvement causing diarrhea, which improved with Valcyte, however he had difficulty tolerating this medication secondary to reduced cell counts.
He was most recently admitted last month for fevers and worsening cough, work-up for which was unrevealing.
Follicular lymphoma as noted above.
Left inguinal hernia 5.
Hypertension 7.
Hyperglycemia while on steroids  Social History: Patient is married and has three children.
Family History: There is no family history of lymphoma or other hematologic diseases.
Since [**2114-12-24**], worsened paranasal sinus changes with air-fluid levels within the left maxillary sinus and sphenoid sinus which in the right clinical setting may represent acute sinusitis.
Worsened fluid/mucosal thickening involving the mastoid air cells bilaterally and the left middle ear cavity.
There is lucency surrounding the cochlea bilaterally consistent with otospongiosis.
CT chest ([**2115-7-3**]): Mixed interval changes, with essential resolution of lingular abnormality and slight improvement of right basilar abnormality, but development of new foci of ground glass attenuation within the left lower lobe, superior segment right lower lobe and both upper lobes.
Although these findings may be due to infection, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia and graft- versus- host disease are additional considerations in the post-transplant setting.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 53 year old male with past medical history of refractory follicular lymphoma, status post allogenic stem cell transplant in [**10-29**] complicated by GVHD and CMV colitis, admitted with neutropenic fever, found to have an acute MSSA and pseudomonas sinusitis and pseudomonas pneumonia.
# Pneumonia: s/p bronch on last admission with pseudomonas and MSSA pna sensitive to zosyn.
On this admisison, again with pseudomonas pna sensitive to zosyn.
Also with pseudomonas and MSSA sinusitis.
# Sinusitis: With MSSA and pseudomonas sinusitis.
# Hyperbilirubinemia: With elevated bilirubin, with both direct and indirect components.
No lab evidence of hemolysis.
Trended down without intervention.
# Neutropenia: Unclear etiology, possibilities include infection and resultant marrow supression versus medication effect.
# Hypotension: Hypotensive on [**7-5**] to SBP 70s, requiring 4 L volume resucitation.
# Lymphoma: On maintenance Rituxan therapy as outpatient.
