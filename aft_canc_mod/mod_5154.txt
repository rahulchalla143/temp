Her exam was notable for a cool right lower extremity with dopplerable pulses, normal strength and sensation.
Vascular surgery was consulted and recommended continuing the heparin gtt and monitoring her neurovasc status overnight but did not think intervention was necessary at this time given no symptoms and dopplerable pulses on the right foot.
She reports that she did notice some pain in her right leg starting at the hip and radiating to her anterior thigh over the last week.
She does have DOE but has not noticed any change from her baseline.

SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
Sizeable filling defect in the left atrium, consistent with tumor thrombosis.
Evidence of arterial thrombosis at the right common iliac artery.
Stable, extensive and diffuse bilateral airspace consolidation consistent with the bronchoalveolar cell cancer.
No abdominal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
Interval resolution of the large right adnexal cyst.
Stable-appearing small right adnexal cyst.
There were no evidence of endobronchial lesions or evidence of recent or old bleeding.
There were no blood clots noted.
Therapeutic aspiration of clear thin secretions was performed mainly in the right lower lobe but also in the left upper lobe as well.
There were no purulent secretions noted.
A nonmobile globular mass (1.6 by 0.8 cm) is seen (in subcostal window only) projecting into the body of the left atrium.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

# Arterial thrombus: Patient has left atrial clot and right common iliac clot.
She had a cool distal extremity on the right with dopplerable pulses.
# Lung cancer: The patient had known metastatic NSCLC.
The patient was hypoxic but at her baseline home O2 requirement.
She was continued on cough suppressants and albuterol as needed as well as vicodin for pain control.
A bronchoscopy was performed which was without evidence of endotracheal bleed.
Her hematocrit was stable and her symptoms improved.
No further interventions were made.
# Tachycardia: The patient was noted to be tachycardic on admission and this was felt to be due to her previously documented atrial thrombus and hypoxia.
EKG was normal and there was no JVD or muffled heart sounds to suggest tamponade.
Echo demonstrated the left atrial mass which appeared to originate from the pulmonary vessels.
