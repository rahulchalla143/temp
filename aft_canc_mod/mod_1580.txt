Detailed Oncologic History: - shave biopsy of a left midback lesion on [**2163-9-29**], revealing an at least 2.4 mm thick [**Doctor Last Name **] level IV melanoma without ulceration, margins were positive - reexcision on [**2163-10-3**], revealing residual invasive 1.8 mm thick melanoma with questionable regression - left shin lesion revealing a nodular basal cell carcinoma with  positive margins; subsequent reexcision showed a dermal scar and no residual basal cell carcinoma - wide local excision of a left back melanoma and axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy on [**2163-10-27**]; primary site revealed only a dermal scar without residual melanoma; no melanoma in 3 examined sentinel lymph nodes - [**10-7**] - noted a firm mass in the right axilla; FNA on [**11-25**] revealed melanoma - CT chest showed right axillary nodule and multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules - [**2166-2-11**] - initiated DTIC therapy with disease progression documented after 2 cycles - [**2166-4-3**] - MRI head with small right posterior parietal and left cerebellar lesions c/w metastatic disease - [**2166-4-8**] - began compassionate use ipilimumab protocol (currently C1W10 of this therapy)   Social History: He lives alone.

Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: Vitals: T: 98.1 BP: 114/72 P: 81 R: 13 O2: 93% on RA General: Alert, oriented x 3 with some slight confusion, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, dry MM, OP clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, spme TTP in the upper abdomen, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly noted GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: PERRL, CN II-XII grossly intact (aside from some slight anisocoria R>L), 5/5 strength throughout, sensation to LT intact throught, 2+ patellar, biceps, and brachioradialis reflexes, wide unsteady gait, mild dysmetria on the L on finger-to-nose   Pertinent Results: CTA [**2166-6-15**]: 1) Progression of multiple bilateral pulmonary metastases.
2) No acute PE or hemothorax.
3) Increased splenic, right adrenal, right posterior infradiaphrammatic lesions consistent with progression of metastatic disease.
Evidence of osseous metastatic disease again seen.
CT head: Multiple hyperdense intracranial lesions with surronding edema, significantly increased size and number from prior MRI, consistent with progression of metastatic melanoma, some of which may contain internal hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 y/o M with known metastatic melanoma, presents with 3 episodes of hemoptysis and worsening confusion and gait disturbance, now with imaging showing worsening metastatic disease.
Hemoptysis: Given imaging findings, likely related to worsened pulmonary metastases with endobronchial involvement.
Pt only reports a small amount of hemoptysis (with the largest amount being approx 5cm x 5cm).
received an MRI during his hospital stay that showed metastatic disease in the brain.
Metastatic Melanoma: Pt with worsening pulmonary, intracranial, splenic, adrenal, osseous, and other metastatic disease.
Onc is aware of admission and recommended ICU admission for overnight observation.
Transaminitis: Most likely related to metastatic disease vs. toxicity from chemo drugs.
Relayed poor prognosis and unlikely helpful interventions.
