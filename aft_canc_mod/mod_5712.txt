He had a cough with white sputum and remained afebrile.

He continued to be difficult to diurese due to hypotension.
On [**7-30**] he became febrile and hypotensive (BP 70-80s), and Ciprofloxacin was added for a UTI.
On [**7-31**] he continued to be hypotensive and was transferred to the CCU for tailored diuresis.
He was transfered from the CCU on [**8-3**], but later that day became febrile and hypotensive and was sent to the MICU for presumed sepsis.
On discharge he is felt to be slightly volume overloaded, but requires very gentle diuresis to avoid hemodynamic decompensation and intravascular volume depletion.
He was seen by the electrophysiology service, who recommend VT ablation, followed by placement of a biventricular pacer, at some point in the near future after his acute issues have resolved (especially his current infections).
Ischemia - the patient has long-standing chest pain that has been unchanged during his course.
Multiple EKGs have shown no changes concerning for acute ischemia.
Troponins were briefly elevated to 0.14 immediately after his MICU course, but this was felt to be due to severe CHF and his concurrent renal insufficiency at that time.
On [**8-3**] he developed fever, hypotension, and respiratory distress (RR 40), and on transfer to the MICU was felt to have a pneumonia on CXR (presumed due to aspiration).
On [**8-13**] he again developed confusion and respiratory distress with no new infiltrate on CXR, and vancomycin IV was added for a 7 day course.
He was transferred to floor on [**8-3**], but again became febrile to 102.4; he was transferred to the MICU for sepsis and treated with zosyn iv for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
He was also found to have bilateral mastoiditis (R>L) by head CT, and was started on tobramycin drops (14 day course) to the right ear.
On [**8-13**] he again developed confusion and respiratory distress with no new infiltrate on CXR, and vancomycin IV was added for a 7 day course.
5) Renal - His Cr has been generally stable throughout his course, with a brief elevation to 2.0 during his MICU stay, felt to be due to intravascular volume depletion in the setting of sepsis.
He had a head CT during a period of acute confusion that showed no acute changes, mass effect, or bleed.
It was not felt that he required further neurologic workup at this time and will hopefully improve with resolution of his CHF and infections.
evaluated by speech and swallow, was felt NOT to be an aspirator, but recommendation was to continue soft solids, no straws, and re-eval when mental status improved.
