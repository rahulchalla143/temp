Admission Date:  [**2102-3-17**]              [**Year/Month/Day **] Date:   [**2102-3-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2019-7-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Olanzapine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9160**] Chief Complaint: tachycardia, hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation, arterial line, right internal jugular central line  History of Present Illness: 82M hx severe dementia, DM, left AKA, CHF, PVD (stent x2, most recent [**5-/2101**]), reported recent NSTEMI on [**2-10**], recent admission from [**Date range (1) 4177**] for a fib with RVR as well as [**Date range (1) 9476**] for CHF exacerbation presenting with tachycardia and hypotension.
Following his recent admission ([**Date range (1) 9476**]), during which he required lasix gtt for diuresis and was discharged on torsemide, he was discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab where he was noted to be tachycardic and hypotensive with SBP 70s-80s on day of admission.
He had episodes of SVT with HR 160s that self-resolved with EKG showing rate related ST depressions in V2-V4.
CXR showed possible aspiration PNA.
CT head was also performed for altered mental status that was unremarkable.
He became hypotensive requiring IV fluids but also showing signs of respiratory distress with tachypnea and oxygen desaturations.

Mild pulmonary edema has improved since [**3-23**].

No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 82M hx severe dementia, DM, CHF, PVD (stent x2, most recent [**5-/2101**]), reported recent NSTEMI on [**2-10**], recent admission from [**Date range (1) 4177**] for a fib with RVR as well as [**Date range (3) 42387**] for CHF exacerbation presenting with tachycardia and hypotension.
# Hypotension: Pt presented with tachycardia, hypotension, minimal urine output.
Given Na elevated to 156, Cr elevated to 4.3 (baseline 2.0-2.3), weight loss and recent aggressive diuresis with torsemide, initial presentation felt to be related in part to severe volume depletion.
However, patient also with notable elevated WBC count, grossly positive UA, and CXR suggestive of possible PNA so patient was covered broadly with vancomycin and cefepime.
Patient was initially started on flagyl as well given patient's questionable endorsement of abdominal discomfort on presentation but as CT Abdomen was negative, flagyl was discontinued on HD #3.
Culture data eventually showed Proteus and E.coli in the urine sensitive to cefepime as well as MRSA in the sputum sensitive to vancomycin.
Despite initial volume resuscitation, patient remained pressor dependent for a majority of his hospital course with MAPs >55 on phenylephrine and vasopressin.
Though his lactate trended down, his central venous O2 sats were greater than 70 indicating persistent septic physiology despite appropriate antibiotic treatment.
# Respiratory distress: Pt with tachypnea and possible oxygen desaturations in ED and was intubated to protect airway.
Initial CXR showed bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis vs aspiration and cultures confirmed MRSA pneumonia.
Extubation was attempted on HD#1 but he had to be re-intubated due to tenacious secretions.
Persistent volume overload also contributed to difficulty with extubation.
# Acute renal failure:  Cr elevated to 4.3 on admission from recent baseline of 2.0-2.3.
Pt was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 9476**] for CHF exacerbation, had been getting aggressive diuresis until recently.
Despite agressive fluid resuscitation and pressor support, patient's urine output remained minimal and his creatinine failed to improve.
His electrolytes remained within normal limits but he became progressively volume overloaded, failing to respond appropriately to diuresis with a lasix gtt partly due to persistently low blood pressures.
Family felt dialysis was not consistent with patient's long-term goals of care so lasix diuresis was discontinued when patient was transitioned to CMO.
Pt then had episodes of SVT in the ED with HR 160s that spontaneously converted.
Throughout his hospital stay, patient would intermittently go into afib with RVR v SVT with an accompanying drop in blood pressures that would spontaneously convert to NSR or require lopressor 2.5mg IV prn.
# Hypernatremia: Na elevated to 156 on admission, likely from volume depletion given elevated Cr, history of minimal urine output, and recent aggressive diuresis.
# Abdominal pain: Per ED report, pt with diffuse abdominal tenderness.
CT abdomen does not show any acute abdominal process.
No further indication of abdominal tenderness during his hospital stay.
# CAD: Pt with reported NSTEMI at OSH [**2-10**], also has remote hx of MI.
Initially EKG shows afib, ST depressions in V1-4, worse when tachycardic, likely due to demand.
Trop elevated to 0.16 but in setting of acute renal failure.
# IDDM: Blood glucose elevated 200s-400s since arrival to ED.
Sugars improved on HISS and low-dose lantus.
# Anemia: Baseline Hct ranges from low to high 20s.
Pt with history of significant GI bleeding.
Patient had one episode of a large, bloody bowel movement so he received 2u pRBCs and underwent EGD which showed no signs of active bleeding.
Presumed to be lower GI source.
# Dementia: Pt with advanced dementia.
# Exophytic lesion: Pt with brown exophytic lesion near genitals.
