On the floor, he denies any complaints - though initially reported some abdominal pain to the RN.

Right bundle-branch block.

Q-T interval prolongation.
Stable post-surgical changes in the right lung from prior right lower lobectomy and upper [**Month/Year (2) 3630**] wedge resection due to known non-small cell lung cancer.
Hazy opacity in the left lower [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] reflect atelectasis.
Bibasilar lung consolidations, worse when compared to prior exam.
Differential diagnosis includes infectious etiologies as well as a slow growing lesion such as bronchoalveolar carcinoma.
No evidence of small bowel obstruction.
Colon appears relatively featureless with air-fluid levels and possibly pericolonic fat stranding versus third spacing.
Extensive vascular calcifications.
S1 vertebral body fracture with buckling of the superior cortex, worse when compared to prior exam.
[**7-30**] Left LENI: IMPRESSION: No left lower extremity DVT.
There is a paucity of air in the left lower quadrant which might be due to liquid stool within the descending colon.
No free air is seen on the right lateral decubitus film.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 78131**] is a 78M with stage IV NSLC who presents with fevers from his rehab facility.
* Hypotension: Patient presented with hypotension concerning for sepsis.
His hypotension was probably due to hypovolemia from diuresis but severe hypotension in setting of developing sepsis was also considered.
* Fever: Patient's fever likely caused by C diff as patient is toxin positive, although aspiration pneumonia was also considered a possibility given evidence of dysphagia on prior video swallow.
His underlying pulmonary malignancy predisposes him to a post-obstructive pneumonia.
However the absence of cough or hypoxia made a pulmonary etiology less compelling.
His C difficile colitis was originally treated with PO vancomycin and IV flagyl.
Prior to discharge, as diarrhea began to resolve, he was switched to PO flagyl alone, to be continued for a two week course (until [**2118-8-12**]).
* L leg swelling and pain: Patient had lower extremity pain edema greater on left than right after receiving fluid resuscitation in the ICU.
LENI showed no evidence of DVT.
* Hyponatremia: Patient's hyponatremia resolved after intravenous fluids, which supports hypovolemia as cause on admission.
At last discharge, thought to have a component of SIADH.
* Acute renal failure: Patient had creatinine elevated to 1.4 and FeNa was 0.1 on admission.
His acute renal failure has resolved and was likely pre-renal as it improved with IVF.
His anemia is consistent with baseline.
* Atrial fibrillation: His sotalol was restarted now that his hypotension resolved.
# Nutrition ??????
Patient has aspiration risks and is unable to swallow pills easily.
He also had an elevated INR despite not being on anticoagulation which possibly could be due to malnutrition.
His methadone should be tapered and pain reassessed daily while in rehab.
Miconazole Nitrate 2 % Powder [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Appl Topical TID (3 times a day) as needed for fungal rash-groin.
Ambien 5 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
Clostridium difficil colitis 2.
Hyponatremia 4.
Hypotension SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile [**2-16**] BM's per day.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital on [**2118-7-28**] with fevers secondary to clostridium dificile colitis (an infection in your colon).
You can continue to take methadone with dilaudid as needed for breakthrough pain.
You also had thrush in your mouth.
Use miconazole for the fungal rash in your groin.
Please return to the emergency room if you have worsening diarrhea >10 BM per day, bloody/black stools, fever>100.4, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other symptoms concerning to you.
