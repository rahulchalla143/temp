NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
[**2114-9-21**] C. diff toxin: NEGATIVE .
[**2114-9-21**] C. diff toxin: NEGATIVE .
Calcified pleural plaques, suggesting previous asbestos exposure.
Degenerative changes in the spine.
Markedly limited pelvic ultrasound and nondiagnostic transvaginal exam due to inability to insert the transvaginal probe.
Possible posterior bladder wall thickening can be better evaluated when MRI is obtained.
[**2114-9-16**] Doppler Ultrasound BLE: No deep venous thrombus in either lower extremity.
[**2114-9-17**] ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
The aortic valve is bicuspid with moderately thickened leaflets.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small circumferential pericardial effusion.
Moderate aortic regurgitation.
Moderate-severe mitral regurgitation.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Note:  There is extensive fragmentation and necrosis and evaluation for invasion is limited   Brief Hospital Course: #Uroseptic shock - Treated empirically with vanc/zosyn.
No organism isolated.
Meropenem discontinued in favor of cefepime when a rash developed.
#Respiratory failure - Intubated [**9-17**] in the setting of unstable tachycardia and flash pulmonary edema.
#Atrial fibrillation - DCCV on [**9-17**] and [**9-20**] for AFib with RVR with conversion to sinus rhythm.
#Acute kidney injury - Secondary to shock, with peak Cr 2.0 ([**9-14**]), improved with fluid resuscitation.
Then Cr up to 1.8 ([**9-21**]) due to acute on chronic systolic CHF which improved with diuresis.
Cardiology offerred valvulplasty if patient were to undergo aggressive management of cervical cancer.
#Hydronephrosis - Secondary to bulky metastatic disease.
Perc nephrostomy placed [**9-15**] and readjustment for malpositioning on [**9-16**].
#Rash - Likely contact dermatitis based on distribution over dorsal surfaces and back.
#Cervical SCC - Biopsy [**9-23**] showed squamous carcinoma, at least in-situ (evaluation for invasion is limited) due to extensive fragmentation and necrosis.
Plan per gyn-onc was to offer palliative treatment following resolution of acute issues given extent of disease.
#Recurrent Respiratory Failure- patient had acute onset dyspnea consistent with flash pulm edema on [**9-27**], with respiratory status temporarily stabilized with non-invasive mechanical ventilation.
She then experienced another episode of a. fib with RVR and flash pulm edema overnight [**Date range (1) 6231**].
Following intubation, patient had persistent hypotension with profound lactic acidosis.
