There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
There is a right small-to-moderate loculated pleural effusion and tiny left pleural effusion.
Additionally, bronchiectasis and consolidation is present in the anterior portion of the right lower lobe.
Coronary vascular calcifications are present.
The left kidney is surgically absent, and there is a wide-mouthed (5cm) incisional hernia over the left posterior flank.
Small nonpathologically enlarged lymph nodes are unchanged.
There is no free fluid, lymphadenopathy, or free air.
There are degenerative changes in the pubic symphysis, and spine.
========================== CXR: Again seen is prominence of the right mediastinal and hilar region with increased interstitial markings in the right upper lobe.
There are right greater than left pleural effusions with volume loss at both bases.
Brief Hospital Course: 75y/o WF w/ TCC s/p L nephrectomy is being called out from the CCU after an admission for SOB.
She was originally admitted to BIDN on [**12-27**] with flank pain and SOB and was found to have hilar masses and liver lesions.
At [**Hospital1 18**], she was initially managed on the floor where ECHO showed no tamponade but CT chest showed partial collapse of the L bronchus by her hilar mass as well as a pericardial effusion.
She was prepped for bronchoscopy with probable stent placement but desaturated during preparation for the bronch and was transfered to the MICU for further management on [**1-2**].
In the ICU, she was treated symptomatically with morphine for her SOB with improvement and possible pericardiocentesis and tissue biopsy were discussed with the family.
She denies any complaints currently outside of some lower back pain and mild dyspnea which is much improved since admission.
