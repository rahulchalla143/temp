Brief Hospital Course: 42 year old man with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 21344**] Lindau disease (with non-functioning pheo s/p right adrenalectomy, pancreatic tail tumor, retinal hemangiomas, multiple spine hemangiomas), metastatic renal cell carcinoma (to lungs, scalp and brain)on sorafenib trial who presented with altered mental status, hyponatremia, and right lobar PNA.
Possible causes considered were: adrenal insufficiency (could be primary as he has h/o pheo, or secondary as he has had surgery on his pituitary gland, but this was not evidenced by his presentation or vital signs) as he has had labile BP recently, especially in the setting of hyperkalemia, or more likely volume depletion secondary to infection as his exam was consistent with volume depletion.
Other possible cause was SIADH as he has intracranial processes as well as pneumonia.
Also, hypothyroidism could be a cause, but his thyroid function tests were all normal.
#Change in Mental Status-unclear if from hyponatremia or infection, more worrisome would be intracranial hemorrhage or stroke as he has history of this, however he improved with antibiotic therapy.
