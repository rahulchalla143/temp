Admission Date:  [**2140-3-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2140-3-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2069-6-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1854**] Chief Complaint: This patient presented with what he described as weakness in his legs and headaches.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: left craniotomy for tumor resection [**2140-3-3**]   History of Present Illness: This patient presented with what he described as weakness in his legs and headaches.
The MRI scan showed a homogeneously enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe para medially which completely occluded the sagittal sinus.
Also wait and see strategy given the size and the inhomogeneity of the contrast enhancement, which was suspicious for atypical features was not advisable.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 54345**] for an at least partial resection to obtain histological diagnosis and provide conditions that make radiosurgery of the tumor parts and the sinus a possibility.
No pronator drift.
Pertinent Results: Post-op MRI [**2140-3-4**]: FINDINGS: Postoperative changes are seen in the area of partially resected meningioma in the high left occipital lobe adjacent to the sagittal sinus.
There are small foci of blood products in the operative bed, and a tiny amount of left subdural blood.
Some residual enhancing mass remains adjacent to the superior sagittal sinus.
Signal change within the sinus itself is not significantly changed from prior exam, allowing for technical factors.
There is high signal on T2W images within the portions of the sagittal sinus inferior to the resection site suggestive of slow flow, but normal enhancement within these areas on post-contrast images, and no increased signal on precontrast T1W images to suggest thrombus.
There is no evidence of acute ischemia.
Mildly restricted diffusion signal at the operative bed is compatible with postsurgical change.
Old infarct in the brainstem is unchanged.
Postoperative change at the site of recently resected meningioma, with some residual enhancing tumor, and unchanged signal abnormality within the adjacent superior sagittal sinus which may represent tumoral invasion or thrombus.
Findings most consistent with slow flow within the sagittal sinus inferior to the resection site.
No additional evidence of sinus thrombosis.
No evidence of acute infarction.
CT Head [**2140-3-3**]: FINDINGS: High left parietal meningioma has been resected via left parietal craniotomy.
Expected postsurgical change is seen in the resection bed.
There is no sign of large intracranial hemorrhage.
Moderate amount of pneumocephalus is present.
There is no sign of mass effect, or vascular territorial infarction.
IMPRESSION: Expected post-surgical change status post resection of left parietal meningioma.
No large intracranial hemorrhage.
Pathology: pending at time of discharge but the frozen section showed meningioma with atypical features  Brief Hospital Course: The patient underwent elective craniotomy for tumor resection on [**2140-3-3**].
He did require intra-operative platelets due to some bleeding.
His CT scan showed no large hemorrhage with expected post-surgical changes in the operative bed.
The MRI showed some residual tumor as well as some blood in the surgical bed and small amount of SDH.
He was ambulating, voiding, and taking in food without difficulty.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**6-24**] days(from your date of surgery) for removal of your sutures and/or a wound check.
