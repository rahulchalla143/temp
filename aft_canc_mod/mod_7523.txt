Admission Date:  [**2151-7-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-7-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2086-7-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Novocain  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**] Chief Complaint: Weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None.
History of Present Illness: Pt is a 64 y.o female with h.o breast cancer and recently dx lung cancer who presented with generalized "weakness" and was found to have cardiac tamponade based on echo.
Pt reports chronic SOB and cough, occasionally at rest, reports orthopnea and a 3L 02 req at home with usual sats in the low 90's.
Pt reports that her breathing has been unchanged recently and upon admission.
Pt reports that she's had palpitations for the last few weeks that have been unchanged, but denies CP or edema.
- Breast cancer status post mastectomy in [**2133**], treated with CMF chemotherapy initially and tamoxifen for 14-1/2 years and then switched to Femara two years ago.
- Hypertension.
She rarely drinks a glass of wine, and works as a manager of an auto parts store.
HEENT: NC/AT, PERRLA,EOMI, anicteric CV: +s1s2 RRR no m/r/g tachycardic Chest: b/l AE decreased airmovement lower R.lung field.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
MEDICAL DECISION MAKING EKG [**2151-7-2**] shows sinus tach.
Prominent T wave in V4-6 still present.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a moderate to large sized circumferential pericardial effusion measuring 1cm inferolateral, lateral and apical to the left ventricle increasing to 2.3 cm anterior to the right ventricle and 1.8cm around the right atrium.
There is brief right atrial and left atrial diastolic collapse c/w increased pericardial pressure/tamponade physiology.
Moderate to large circumferential pericardial effusion with evidence of increased pericardial pressure/tamponade physiology.
Post-procedure ECHO performed on [**2151-7-2**] at 6:08:27 demonstrated: In single view, there is only a small pericardial effusion.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2151-7-2**] demonstrated: systolic arterial HTN, mild pulsus paradoxus, hemodynamics c/w low pressure tamponade, with some equalization of RA and pericardial pressure.
Bedside echo showing minimal pericardial fluid.
Extensive right mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with partial right upper lobe atelectasis, contiguous with adjacent central neoplasm.
Treatment response cannot be evaluated as there are no prior exams available for comparison.
Diffuse smooth thickening of the interstitium raising possibility of lymphangitic carcinomatosis, but differential diagnosis includes hydrostatic edema, drug toxicity, and atypical infection.
Diffuse ground-glass opacity with small focal areas of consolidation in the left lung may represent infection and less likely asymmetric pulmonary edema.
Large pericardial effusion.
Compression fractures of the T7 and T11 vertebral bodies, likely due to underlying metastases.
Worsening bilateral opacities, left greater than the right, with prominent interstitial markings.
Findings may represent worsening pulmonary edema or infection superimposed on a background of lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
Right hilar mass compatible with patient's known lymphadenopathy.
Cardiac size is difficult to estimate given the presence of left lung opacification.
The patient presented with a pericardial effusion seen on Chest CT [**6-24**].
Pt was feeling weak and dyspneic and an echocardiogram on [**2151-7-2**] revealed low pressure tamponade physiology.
Cultures from pericardial fluid were positive for staph and enterococcus and vancomycin and levofloxacin were started.
The patient's dyspnea was thought to be secondary to lymphangitic spread of her lung cancer.
Her ABGs showed respiratory acidosis with high CO2 retention.
Also, the patient's course was complicated by intermittent episodes of atrial fibrilation that required metoprolol and diltiazem for rate control.
The immediate cause of death was respiratory failure and the antecedent cause was metastatic lung cancer.
