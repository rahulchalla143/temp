No hemoptysis; no fever or chills.
Head CT was negative for bleeding.
Past Medical History: GBM s/p craniotomy for tumor resection on [**2163-12-23**] - initially with sx of depression in [**11-23**], then gait unsteadiness lead to dx.
residual mild left-sided weakness.
multifocal right frontal lesions, larger lesion removed.
Hypercholesterolemia Elevated PSA noted [**2163-6-17**]--elected watchful waiting, unclear if had [**Name (NI) **]  All:  NKDA  Social History: He was a financial consultant (took a leave of absence in the end of [**11-18**] trouble driving).
Family History: Brother with DVT and PE (has elevated PSA), no FH of stroke, seizure, CAD, or cancer  Physical Exam: T: 98.3  BP: 111/68  HR:79  R:25 O2Sats: 95% on 5L NC Gen:  Comfortable, pleasant, short of breath with talking but able to speak in complete sentences.
Cardiac:  S1, S2, RRR, no murmur Lungs:  Not using accessory muscles, crackles at bases b/l; takes short, truncated breaths Abd: +BS, soft, NT, ND Ext: no edema on right LE; 2+ LLE pitting edema to knee; no palpable cord in left calf; DP +2 b/l Neuro: Alert and oriented x 3; delayed but appropriate responses with conversation; no dysarthria or inappropriate word choice .

+ clonus in LLE.
No difficulty with rapid alternating movements in hands.
Acute pulmonary embolism involving both distal main pulmonary arteries with extension into segmental branches of all pulmonary lobes.
Prominence of the right ventricle suggests right heart strain for which further evaluation with echocardiography is suggested.
MR BRAIN: MPRESSION: Since [**2163-12-24**], increase in size of the enhancing mass involving the right centrum semiovale and possible minimal increase in size of a 0.4-cm lesion more inferiorly involving the right frontal/insular region.
T2 hyperintensities involving the corpus callosum and the frontal lobe white matter bilaterally which likely represents combination of edema and tumor.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 y/o male with GBM and new large DVT/PE, started on heparin drip and transferred from MICU to floor on supplemental oxygen, discharged on room air on lovenox.
# DVT/PE and hypoxia -- clots likely [**2-18**] cancer.
Brother w/ h/o of PE in setting of marathon and long flight, no other h/o hematologic disorders.
# Glioblastoma multiforme: s/p neurosurgical resection of one tumor and started radiation for other lesion at outpt rad onc, now on hold since hospitalized.
He had some proximal lower extremity weakness on neurologic exam but otherwise no focal findings.
Repeat MRI w/o significant e/o tumor recurrence.
# H/A: ?
[**2-18**] edema versus hypoxia.
H/A also potentially related to increased hypoxia overnight but improved on discharge.
Rital deferred [**2-18**] PE and potential right hear strain.
# Dyslipidemia - continued crestor .
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: pulmonary embolus deep venous thrombosis SECONDARY: Glioblastoma multiforme Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: O2 sat: 96% on RA   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with shortness of breath and left leg pain and were found to have a DVT (deep venous thrombosis) and PE (pulmonary embolus) that likely arouse from the clot in your leg.
