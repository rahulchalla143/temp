Pt also had several bouts of emesis along with her baseline nausea.
Pt denies any particular other symptoms such as diplopia, visual changes, or focal weakness or sensory changes.
NCHCT obtained from ED revealed progressive cerebellar edema.
Neurosurgery called and recommended Decadron 10mg after which patient's headache resolved.
Review of systems:  No recent fever, weight loss, cough, rhinorrhea, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, diarrhea, or rash.
Past Medical History: -Crohn's disease s/p ileocecectomy [**8-24**] w/ path results: Chronic active ileitis with ulceration, transmural inflammation, fissures, 4.5 cm abscess, and a rare granuloma consistent with Crohn's disease.
[**6-26**] screening colonoscopy: No abornmal findings other than ulcer with granulation tissue @ SB anasatomis.
initial examination showed evidence of cranial nerve involvement of 3, 4, and 6 as well as dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia of the right arm and gait difficulty with falling to the right.
MRI showed a right cerebellar mass.
No EtOH, tobacco.

tongue protrudes midline, no atrophy or fasciculations Motor:	nl bulk and tone, no tremor, rigidity or bradykinesia.
Mild R parietal drift.
Coord:	bilat dysmetria R>L with FNF.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
Dramatic enlargement of the hypodense focus in the right cerebellum with more mass effect on the fourth ventricle, and evidence of early hydrocephalus.
There has not been any overt change in ventricular size.
The large area of edema within the right cerebellar hemisphere continues to be present.
There may be slightly less compression of the fourth ventricle at this time, but the degree of mass effect exerted upon the structure is still quite substantial.
Both studies raise the possibility of mild herniation of the right cerebellar tonsil.
There is also mild upward herniation of the right side of the vermis and contiguous portion of the right cerebellar hemisphere.
CONCLUSION: Continued prominent mass effect in the right cerebellar hemisphere, status post placement of ventricular drainage catheter.
MRI brain: Rim-enhancing right cerebellar lesion with surrounding edema.
Although the size of the rim-enhancing lesion has not significantly changed compared to the prior study of [**2133-5-7**], there is slight increase in edema, but the deformity of the fourth ventricle has remained unchanged.
A new right ventricular shunt catheter is identified.
No evidence of slow diffusion in the posterior fossa or in other parts of the brain to indicate acute infarct.
CXR Mild atelectasis at the base of the left lung is new.
No pleural effusion or evidence of central adenopathy.
Brief Hospital Course: 58yo with GBM and now apparent worsening of posterior fossa edema perhaps secondary to post-radiation treatment.
There was no apparent hydrocephalus on CT, however, there was critical compression and effeacement of the 4th ventricle which required CSF diversion procedure.
Post operative CT scan showed persistent significant mass effect in the posterior fossa.
This was thought likely related to necrosis associated with post-radiation changes.
This showed a slight increase in edema, but no significant change in the size of her lesion.
The patient was seen by PT and OT services in preparation for discharge.
Have a family member check your incision daily for signs of infection ??????
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber as pain medicine (narcotics) can cause constipation ??????
New onset of tremors or seizures ??????
Any confusion or change in mental status ??????
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities ??????
Pain or headache that is continually increasing or not relieved by pain medication ??????
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, drainage ??????
