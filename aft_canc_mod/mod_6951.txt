On [**2159-10-22**], patient presented s/p fall and was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation in the setting of acute stress induced cardiomyopathy with an EF of 25-30% and bilateral pleural effusions.
A repeat TTE at the time of discharge did not demonstrate reaccumulation of her effusion, which was thought to be secondary to her dasatinib.
Hospital course complicated by strep pneumo septicemia and patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics.
Of note, following her fall, OSH CT was suggestive of SAH/SDH, and brain MRI demonstrated findings consistent with PRES vs. evolving infarcts, for which she has been followed by neurology as an outpatient.
Since her discharge, patient has been doing fairly well, and denies any signficant chest pain, dyspnea, fevers, chills, palpitations, PND, or orthopnea.
Patient was started on gleevec 6 days prior, and was evaluated by her cardiologist on [**2158-12-19**] as an outpatient follow up visit and surveillance TTE demonstrated a moderate pericardial effusion with early signs of tamponade physiology.
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] for consideration of a pericardial window.
Today, patient was taken to the cath lab and underwent ballon pericardiotomy with removal of 450 cc of serosanguinous fluid.
On the floor, patient reports that she is without acute complaints.

The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.

Pericardiocentesis and balloon pericardiotomy was performed under local anesthesia and moderate sedation via sub-xiphoid approach.
Right femoral artery and vein were also accessed with placement of a 4 Fr and a 5 Fr sheath respectively.
This was performed to maintain arterio-venous access to deal with any complications during the procedure, and also for hemodynamic monitoring during the procedure.
A drainage catheter was then advanced posteriorly in the area of loculation and about 450 ml serosanguinous fluid was drained and sent to lab for analysis.
Then an 8 Fr [**Last Name (un) **] tip sheath was advanced to the sac over an Amplatz superstiff wire for optimum support.
A Tyshak II 5 cm x 22 mm balloon catheter was then advanced astride the parietal pericardium, the sheath withdrawn, position of the balloon verified by contrast injection through the sheath, and the balloon inflated 3 times to perform balloon pericardiotomy.
Patient had a brief vasovagal episode during the procedure that was treated with atropine and IV fluids.
Final echo images showed near complete resolution of the effusion.
The arterial and venous sheaths from the right groin were removed in the cath lab and manual pressure held for hemostasis.
Large recurrent loculated pericardial effusion with late diastolic right atrial collapse.
Pericardial effusion successfully treated with pericardiocentesis and balloon pericardiotomy 3.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.
Effusion echo dense, c/w blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Significant aortic regurgitation is present, but cannot be quantified.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There is new right lower lobe consolidation highly concerning for infectious process.
There is interval decrease in the cardiac silhouette consistent with known pericardial drainage.
Right upper lobe opacity is also noted, and concerning for infectious process as well.
Brief Hospital Course: 62 year old female with a PMH notable for CML in remission for 15 years on hydroxyurea with recent relapse, s/p recent admission from [**Date range (1) 105483**]/11 with complicated medical course necessitating ICU care following fall, pericardial effusion, acute stress induced cardiomyopathy and volume overload, who underwent pericardiocentesis with drainage of 700 cc straw colored effusion on [**2159-10-22**] and represented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2159-12-20**] with recurrent pericardial effusion.
# Pericardial Effusion: Differential for pericardial effusion is broad and includes idiopathic (most commonly), iatrogenic, trauma, malignancy, post MI, uremia, thyroid disease, viral, medication related or collagen vascular disease.
Patient's prior pericardial effusion was thought to be secondary to dasatinib, which has subsequently been discontinued.
Gram stain of pericardial fluid was unrevealing and cultures showed no growth.
Pt had roughly 700 ccs of pericardial fluid removed.
S/P pericardiotomy pt remained hemodynamically stable without elevated pulsus.
Drain was pulled on [**2159-12-22**] without issues after repeat TTE showed no further reaccumulation of pericardial fluid.
# leukocytosis - on [**2159-12-22**] pt had WBC of 15.
It was felt to be secondary to cardiac manipulation and stress response.
However, there did appear to be possible infiltrates in the right upper and lower lobes on cxr (although very subtle).
Accordingly, she was treated for community acquired pneumonia and sent home to complete a 5 day course of levofloxacin.
UA showed pyuria but no bacteria, and culture was without growth.
Blood cultures also showed no growth.
pt was being treated with Gleevac at the time of admission, which was held as it was felt to be a likely etiology for pericardial effusion re-accumulation.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: would suggest rheumatologic workup for investigation of etiology of recurrent pericardial effusions.
Pt found to have evidence of right upper and right lower lobe consolidation, given 5d course of levofloxacin for CAP.
