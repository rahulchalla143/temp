Yesterday, he was out on the back deck in the pouring rain smoking (heavy smoker, 2 ppd) and this morning he fell in his room, onto his knees, no LOC or head hit.
He was noted to have bilateral LE edema, crackly on exam, but mentating well and following commands.
Initally 88% on NRB, Bipap'ed him with improvement in his symptoms and saturation.
The first ABG before Bipap showed acute respiratory acidosis with pH 7.29/56/76/28 on unclear O2.
CXR showed mild pulmonary edema and low lung volumes.
Labs were signficiant for severe hypoNa to 108, K 8.3 but hemolyzed (repeat 5.1), normal renal function, leukocytosis to 12.3 with 2% bands, new thrombocytopenia to 81, lactate 1.3 --> 0.7. .
Of note, pt was last admitted in [**11/2158**] for hypoxia to 83%RA at a group home, had a CTA showing LUL tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] (inflammatory vs infectious), dilated PA.
He was noted to be wheezy and received nebs and short Prednisone burst with rapid improvement.
He had eleavated LFT's on admission that trended down; RUQ u/s showed splenomegaly and trace ascites but patent portal vasculature.
Further review of OMR notes shows an admission [**7-/2157**] for hyponatremia, increased LE swelling that improved with Lasix diuresis.
He was then found to be obtunded, febrile, hypoxic; he was intubated for hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure; sputum cultures grew strep pneumo and bronch showed thick plugs in R airways with purulent drainage.
He was treated with Vanc/Levo/Zosyn --> Cefepime x8 d. He was hyponatremic at that time as well, which was thought to be cirrhotic in etiology; he was fluid restricted and diuresed.
