Admission Date:  [**2128-10-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-11-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2058-9-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Zofran  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**] Chief Complaint: Pelvic Mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Exploratory laparotomy via vertical midline incision, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, rectosigmoid resection with end colostomy,ileocecectomy with primary side-to-side functional end-to-endanastomosis, pelvic washout, placement of bilateral ureteral stents and closure of post-operative wound   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 yo gravida 3 para 3 who initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] ED on [**9-3**] with tachycardia.
As an out-patient she had a CT scan which revealed a pelvic mass likely originating from her uterus and extending above her umbilicus.
The scan also suggested fistula with the bowel, right hydronephrosis, and question of invasion of the IVC.
She notes some shortness of breath with ambulation.
Past Medical History: POBHx: SVD x 3 ([**2086**], [**2088**], [**2094**]) no complications  PGYNHx:  Menopause in her early 50s prior to which she had regular periods.
No hormone therapy.
No history of abnormal Paps, STIs.
She has never had a mammogram or colonoscopy.
Family History: Negative for breast, ovarian, colon, or uterine cancer.
Physical Exam: VS: 98.4 127/74 119 20 100%RA (sitting)           96/67 138    100%RA (standing) Gen: Pale, NAD, no diaphoresis Card: Regular rhythm.
No clear adnexal masses palpated.
The pulmonary vasculature is better accessible and shows considerable perivascular haze most marked in the lung bases.
Complete obliteration of the left diaphragmatic contour is suggestive of atelectasis in the retrocardiac space.
There is no evidence of new discrete pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates in comparison with the next preceding study.
Analysis of the three examinations in sequence suggests further deterioration of CHF between [**10-26**] and 29, but now some improvement during the latest interval [**10-27**] through 30.
Observe that on today's examination, the ultimate left lateral lower chest wall is not included in the image field.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the left ventricle.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
with focal mild hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-10-1**], left and right ventricular systolic dysfunction are new (?Takotsubo or multivessel CAD) and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension are now seen.
Continued opacification at the left base is consistent with pleural effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe.
There has been substantial decrease in the pulmonary vascular congestion described on the previous study.
Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 yo G3P3 s/p cystoscopy with ureteral stenting (by urology), TAH-BSO, sigmoid resection, ileal resection, ileocecal reanastomosis, sigmoid colostomy and IUD removal for uterine malignancy with fistula to sigmoid and possibly to ileum on [**10-5**].
Brief course as follows: 70yo woman without PMH until she was found to have a pelvic mass in [**Month (only) 216**], ultimately diagnosed with originally advanced uterine malignancy with enterouterine and colouterine fistula, and fecal pelvic abscess.
ID was consulted once she was on the floor for fever and altered mental status, and no new source of infection was found.
On [**10-26**] she unexpectedly had PEA arrest (?torsades), from which she was quickly resuscitated then transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
She was hypomagnesemic and hypokalemic, and she had received a dose of Zofran one hour prior to the event.
TTE showed new Takotsubo's syndrome (severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the left ventricle).
She has been hemodynamically stable with mild tachycardia, for which [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] team is titrating lopressor.
She was also started on anticoagulation with enoxaparin given apical hypokinesis, and warfarin was started on [**10-28**].
She has become markedly volume overloaded secondary to aggressive resuscitation, but she has been diuresing well for a few days.
She also had a couple of episodes of NSVT on [**10-28**], asymptomatic with BP stable, thought to be due to PICC placement, so it was repositioned.
There was a question of nosocomial pneumonia since her cardiac arrest, for which she was started on vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl on [**10-27**].
She has stable anemia of chronic disease.
By problem:  *) Torsades/VTach arrest: On [**10-26**] a code was called for several episodes of unresponsiveness.
When the code team arrived the patient went into a wide complex tachycardia.
In retrospect, this may have represented polymorphic VT, but was interpreted as VFIB.
A single shock was given with return of her pulse and sinus rhythm with some ectopy was noted.
A 12 lead EKG showed no acute ischemic changes, but did show a prolonged QTc.
EP was consulted and believe arrest was due to sympathetic combined with vagal tone, possibly exacerbated by long QT.
An Echo was done and was concerning for Takusobos cardiomyopathy.
*) Acute systolic CHF: On [**10-27**] the patient complained of wheezing sensation and had bibasilar crackles on exam, with O2 sats down to 91% on RA.
This was in the setting of new beta blockade and could represent an exacerbation of her mild reactive airway disease.
A CXR concerning for volume overload vs possible PNA.
She was diuresed with lasix and received 1 nebulizer treatment and her symptoms improved significantly.
Ms [**Known lastname **] had a wound vac placed.
*) Advanced uterine cancer: pathology was consistent with grade 3 stage IVB endometriod endometrial CA.
On extubation she was minimally responsive and a head CT was done which showed no acute intracranial process.
On [**10-13**] she had an episode of altered mental status in which she was alert and appropriate but non-verbal.
She had a full workup and no infectious, iatrogenic, or metabolic abnormalities were identified.
*) Presumed intraabdominal infection.
*) Ureteral obstruction: A stent was placed in the right ureter due to hydronephrosis and compression by tumor.
She was tolerating a regular diet as of [**10-18**] but have very poor intake.
*) Anemia, leukopenia related to chemotherapy, malignancy, chronic disease.
If her Hct remains low, or drops further, she could be transfused, with diuresis given recent systolic CHF.
She had no evidence of active blood loss.
Hair Prosthesis Hair prosthesis for chemotherapy-induced alopecia 2.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
Outpatient Lab Work Daily CMP, CBC   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: grade 3 stage IVB endometriod endometrial Cancer Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and prolonged QT syndrome cardiac arrest  Discharge Condition: Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
You were treated with vancomycin, metronidazole, and cefepime for a total of 14 days for intra-abdominal infection.
No new source of infection was found.
Your magnesium and potassium were low, and as you received a dose of Zofran one hour prior to the event, that medication may have caused your cardiac arrest.
Echocardiogram (ultrasound of your heart) showed new congestive heart failure, likely secondary to the cardiac arrest.
Instructions: -You should not drive for 2 weeks and while taking narcotic pain medications -No intercourse, tampons, or douching for 6 weeks -No heavy lifting or vigorous activity for 6 weeks -You can shower and clean your wound, but do not use perfumed soaps or lotions.
