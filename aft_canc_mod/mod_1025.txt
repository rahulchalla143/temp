Admission Date:  [**2164-10-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-11-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-4-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ampicillin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**] Chief Complaint: Neutropenic fever Confusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: 66-year-old male with MDS, normal pressure hydrocephalus, CAD, HTN who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] with neutropenic fever and respiratory symptoms.
He was admitted on [**2164-10-21**] with URI sx with 2 days of sore throat and this progressed to a dry cough and was fatigued.
He was noted by his wife to be tired and llethargic and mildly confused at 7am was found by his wife in the bedroom after having knocked some things over after having taken some cough syrup and complained off "dizziness" and was put back into bed.
His wife put him to bed and by 9am he was not appropriately responsive and had the urge to urinate but was unable to get off the bed and was mildly confused (does not recall any of these events now and this history was from his wife).
on arrival to the [**Location (un) 620**] ED where initial VS were T 98.8, HR 90, BP 156/61, RR 20, O2 sat 90% on RA and he spiked a fever to 103 and was markedly confused and disoriented and was unable to recognize his wife and daughter.
CXR revealed no pneumonia although a pulmonary vs line source was suspected (has a Portacath) and therefore was commenced on IV vanc and cefepime for febrile neutropenia.He received tylenol 650 mg PR, cefepime 2g IV and vancomycin infusion was started but not completed.
Head CT was reviewed by neurosurgery In ICU he was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics adding azithromycin and he was investigated for possible causes with rapid respiratory viral screen and a legionella urinary antigen which were all negative.
repeat CXR on read felt to be deem at the right base which were postulated to be due to recent transfusion or drug reaction.
On to have a TTE which showed a mildly dilated LA and EF 65-70% and was otherwise normal.
On [**10-22**], he developed [**1-8**] CP and had some T wave inversion on telemetry in the setting of coming off O2 and arising to urinate and this resolved with O2.
He had further chest pain at 03:26 on [**10-23**] and there was evidence at this time of ST depressions and flipped T waves however ECG was unchanged.
Repeat CXR on [**10-23**] still showed continued pulmonary congestive changes.
The chest pain was felt likely to be demand ischemia in the context of infection and anemia - he has angina managed witty isosorbide mononitrate at baseline.
In addition he was found to be diabetic on the ICU with high fingerstick blood sugars and an HbA1c of 8.3%.
He had a profound thrombocytopenia and s last transfused on [**10-21**] and was transfused 2 units of RCC on [**10-23**] due to a HCt of 19 in the setting of demand ischemia.
he currently feels well with no further chest pain (states when he "over stresses" and when anaemic).
Still has a mild cough which has been unproductive.
He has had no deferasirox since being in hospital.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI, + nasal congestion + chronic diarrhea related to deferasirox.
(-) Denies headache, sinus tenderness.
Denies shortness of breath or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, or palpitations.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
No sweats or tremors.
No stents or angioplasties.
Angina - once weekly depending on anemia and stress levels normally lasting 10-15 mins and resolves with nitro.
Describes as a squeezing central/left chest pain with no radiation usually but can rarely will rarely feel in these locations.
No nausea/vomiting or sweating.
PVD OSA on CPAP with morbid obesity History of possible TIA [**2162**] ?
CVA - had resolution of eye position abnormalities over a few days MDS with thrombocytopenia and anemia dx [**2159**] Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Asthma, cold-induced s/p ruptured appendix s/p right carotid endarterectomy several years ago .
Hematologic Hx longstanding history of myelodysplastic disorder associated with severe pancytopenia, now red cell and platelet transfusion requiring.
At that time, he anemia, a low platelet count, and a borderline low white blood count.
There is current discussion regarding his candidacy for BMT and it seems that the general feeling is that a patient with his cardiac status would be at too higher risk to go ahead with an allogeneic transplant but there is currrent discussion with his cardiologist Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].
In the past it has been felt that he was not a candidate for any kind of stenting procedure because of his significant thrombocytopenia  Social History: Lives with wife in house with stairs No walking aids but holds onto walls and door-knobs but can walk to the car and can walk 20-50 yards limited by claudication and back pain He previously worked as a computer programmer and retired.

XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2164-10-22**] 12:23 AM IMPRESSION: Interstitial pulmonary edema has improved since [**10-21**], suggesting that the residual interstitial abnormality at the base of the right lung is edema rather than pneumonia.
Findings could have been due to recent transfusion or drug reaction.
There is no pleural effusion or evidence of central adenopathy.
XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2164-10-23**] 5:33 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**10-22**], the outer lower portion of the left hemithorax has been excluded from the image.
There is still some engorgement of pulmonary vessels consistent with increased pulmonary venous pressure.
The possibility of supervening pneumonia at the right base can certainly not be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) PORT	Study Date of [**2164-10-23**] 8:15 AM Examination is limited due to portable technique.
Hepatic echogenicity is diffusely increased.
No focal liver lesion is identified.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilation.
There is no ascites.
There is no hydronephrosis or renal mass identified.
No evidence of gallbladder pathology or biliary obstruction.
Diffusely increased hepatic echotexture without focal lesion.
Findings are likely related to fatty infiltration, but additional liver processes such as cirrhosis and fibrosis cannot be excluded.
There is no pathologic enlargement of the supraclavicular, mediastinal or axillary lymph nodes.
Coronary artery calcifications are minor.
There is no pleural effusion.
Multifocal bronchocentric ground-glass opacity and more confluent left lower lobe consolidation are suggestive of an acute viral pneumonia.
A granuloma in the left posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe is calcified.
This study is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation only to confirm severe hepatic steatosis, an 18 x 16-mm left adrenal lesion of 28 Hounsfield units in density and a normal-appearing right adrenal gland.
Lower thoracic spine osteophytosis is mild.
Multifocal ground-glass opacities in a bronchocentric distribution is most likely a viral infection.
If bronchoalveolar lavage is considered, the superior segment of the left lower lobe is the site likely to give the highest yield.
XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2164-11-1**] 12:28 PM Port-A-Cath is seen approaching from the right subclavian artery into the lower SVC, unchanged in position from prior study without evidence of fracture or kinking of the catheter.
The remainder of the lungs are clear without focal opacity.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Normal appearance of right Port-A-Cath without evidence of obstruction or damage.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 year old male with MDS transfusion dependent.dx [**1-/2160**] with pancytopenia - brief rx azacitidine x4 cycles with no effect having iron chelation with deferasirox, felt at too high risk for cath or transplant currently.
Other PMH significant for normal pressure hydrocephalus, CAD, HTN and newly diagnosed T2DM.
He presented with neutropenic fever and confusion on [**10-21**].
He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics and his confusion rapidly resolved although his cough persisted.
He developed a rash on back was found to have diseminated HSV-1 for which he was treated initially with IV acyclopvir and then after his rash had crusted, with oral valacyclovir.
His rash greatly improved as dis his cough and was discharged on [**2164-11-2**] with hematology follow-up.
An incidental left adrenal lesion was found on CT and  this should be further evaluated as appropriate in the community.
# Neutropenic fever: Mr [**Known lastname **] presented with a 2-day history of cough and latterly confusion and fever to 103F.
He was evaluated in the [**Hospital1 **] ED with a CT-head which showed no change other than stable features in keeping with NPH and a CXR showed infiltrated ?
Due to persistent cough, he had a CT chest on [**10-25**] which showed multifocal bronchocentric ground-glass opacities and more confluent left lower lobe consolidation suggestive of an acute viral pneumonia.
Additionally, on [**10-25**], he developed a vesicular rash on his posterior neck and this was evaluated by dermatology who were concerned for possible VZV/HSV.
He was reviewed by infectious diseases on [**10-26**] at which point there was evidence of dissemination with the rash appearing on his right cheek, left nostril and left ear lobe and they recommended 21 days of antiviral therapy with IV therapy until his rash was entirely crusted over.
He had no further fevers during his stay and he had no further confusion.
Vancomycin was stopped on [**10-29**] and cefepime on [**10-31**] at which point he was changed  to oral levofloxacin to complete an antibiotic course on [**11-5**] for persistent cough.
# MDS - Mr [**Known lastname **] has severe MDS requiring frequent out-patient transfusions.
# Incidental finding of left adrenal lesion: Mr [**Known lastname **] had a CT-Chets to evaluate for his persistent cough this showed an 18 x 16-mm left adrenal lesion of 28 Hounsfield units in density and a normal-appearing right adrenal gland and radiology advised further imaging with MRI if this has not already been done.
# CAD - normally weekly angina on exertion.
He had 2 episodes of chest pain in the ICU which were felt to be demand ischemia with associated T-wave inversion and ST depression transiently on telemetry which improved with oxygen and nitro.
Due to initial concerns of neutropenic sepsis in the ICU, he was started on reduced doses of his home anti-hyprtensives/anti-anginals and these were slowly titrated up to his home levels during his stay.
He had no further chest pain during his admission.
# New dx DMT2: Mr [**Known lastname **] was found to have high blood glucose readings on fingersticks while in the ICU and was found to have an HbA1c of 8.3% and was started on an insulin sliding scale.
# Rash - Disseminated HSV: On [**10-25**], he developed a vesicular rash on his posterior neck and this was evaluated by dermatology who were concerned for possible VZV/HSV.
He was reviewed by infectious diseases on [**10-26**] at which point there was evidence of dissemination with the rash appearing on his right cheek, left nostril and left ear lobe and they recommended 21 days of antiviral therapy with IV therapy until his rash was entirely crusted over.
# Normal pressure hydrocephalus - He is awaiting shunt insertion but this has been delayed due to his disseminated HSV and episode of febrile neutropenia.
# OSA: He continued using his home CPAP machine and other than being at times slow to rouse in the mornings, there were no undue sequelae.
# Hypertension - Due to initial presentation with febrile neutropenia and confusion and concerns for decompensation, he was commenced on reduced doses of his anti-hypertensives and his BP was not overly high with this.
# BPH/urinary problems ([**Name2 (NI) 30636**] given NPH): We continued tamsulosin and oxybutynin.
