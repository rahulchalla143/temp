She presented to her oncologist this a.m. c/o right shoulder pain X 2 days, intermittent dysphagia (solids >liquids) X 1 week, and "difficulty breathing in" X 5 days.
She was noted to have stridor (concerning for tracheal compression) and elevated JVP (concerning for early SVC syndrome) and was admitted for further evaluation/management.
She had a total spine MRI which showed collapse of T1 c/w a pathological fracture with anterior edema as well as evidence of metastases at T10, T12, left L5 lamina, and left sacral ala.
However, there was no evidence of significant cord compression or neural foraminal narrowing.
She also had a chest CT which showed marked progression of disease with a large mass invading the right aspect of the mediastinal with significant narrowing of the distal trachea (and possible invasion), encasement of the lateral aspect of the SVC, esophagus, and right SC vessels, as well as evidence of lymphagitic spread within the lungs.
Ortho-spine following---recommended brace, intervention only if neuro changes, no signs cord compression now.

Metastatic Lung cancer: On presentation, she had ?cord compression and tracheal narrowing.
Steroids were initially administered for ?cord compression (no definite evidence on spinal MRI).
She had balloon dilation of her trachea, but flexible and rigid bronchoscopy with stenting could not be performed.
