Admission Date:  [**2194-12-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2194-12-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2131-12-31**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**] Chief Complaint: admitted for elective pericardiocentesis after recent ECHO showed large pericardial effusion but no tamponade   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: pericardiocentesis and drain placement   History of Present Illness: HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year-old gentleman with a history of metastatic renal cell CA (diagnosed [**2181**], s/p L nephrectomy, recurrence in contralateral kidney, spine, and thoracic cavity detected in [**2192**], placed on radiation therapy and interleukin which was unsuccessful, then on Pfizer study medication x 2 years but recently dc'd due to cardiomyopathy) who presents for elective pericardiocentesis after recent ECHO showed 2cm pericardial effusion.
Study medication was recently dc'd as ECHO on [**2194-10-20**] showed mildly dilated LA and mod dilated LV (6.1 cm), severe LV hypokinesis with an EF of 15-20% -- patient had dilated cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology, without evidence of effusion.
Over the last few weeks, patient had gained ~ 20lbs, developed B/L LE edema, and had developed dyspnea on exertion.
Patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 696**] and started on lasix, with improvement in symptoms after 3 days.
A CT scan on [**11-28**] on Mr. [**Known lastname **] revealed a pericardial effusion, and an ECHO that day revealed moderate circumferential pericardial effusion (up to 2 cm) with poor EF.
Repeat ECHo on [**12-1**] showed no significant change -- pericardial effusion with large fibrin deposits and masses on the surface of the heart c/w extracardiac metastatic disease,a dn there were no clear echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
1080 cc of straw-colored fluid were drained.
Metastatic renal cell CA (s/p L nephrectomy [**2181**], metastatic disease detected [**2192**] including R kidney disease) 2.
Family History: Mr. [**Known lastname 48126**] mother had coronary artery disease and passed away from congestive heart failure.
His father died of complication of alcoholic cirrhosis.
Trachea midline.
No CVA tenderness EXT: DPs full, symmetric.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated no CAD.
Resting hemodynamcis demonstrated mildly elevated left sided filling pressures, mean PCWP=13 mmHg, with mildly depressed systemic systolic and diastolic pressures.
Right atrial pressures were significantly elevated with mean RA=19 mmHg, but without loss of the y-descent.
There was a normal RV pressure waveform with mildly elevated right sided filling pressures with RVEDP=12 mmHg.
Fluid was sent to the lab for cytologic and microbiologic assessment.
Mild systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
Evidence of early pericardial tamponade.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is no definite pericardial effusion seen (a small (focal), loculated pericardial effusion behind the RA cannot be excluded).
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 62 year-old male with metastatic renal cell CA and cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology who p/w pericardial effusion.
Patient was taken to the catheterization laboratory after earlier CT Scan and ECHO showed evidence of moderate/large pericardial effusion.
Fluid was sent to the lab for cytologic and microbiologic assessment.
Fluid chemistries consistent with exudate.
Repeat ECHo on day of discharge confirmed no pericardial fluid collection.
B. Coronary angiography showed no evidence of flow limiting lesions or coronary artery disease.
C. Per ECHO [**10-20**], patient with dilated cardiomyopathy and reduced EF 15-20%.
Etiology of cardiomyopathy was still under investigation.
Iron studies without evidence of hemochromatosis.
Patient maintained good urine output, was alert and oriented x 3 without mental status changes, and extremities remained well-perfused.
Relative hypotension was thought to be secondary to poor ejection fraction/cardiac output, and responded appropriately to gentle fluid boluses.
UTI/Low-grade fever Patient with history of bladder atonia necessitating straight cath at home.
UA positive for UTI on this admission, patient started on Cipro 500 [**Hospital1 **] x 7 days.
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA Patient is followed as outpatient by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Etiology of pericardial effusion is thought to be secondary to metastatic renal cell CA.
Prophylaxis As inpatient, patient received Heparin 5000SC TID for DVT prophylaxis given malignancy and bedrest.
Pericardial effusion s/p pericardiocentesis Secondary 1.
Metastatic renal cell CA   Discharge Condition: ambulating without oxygen requirement, no chest pain, shortness of breath  Discharge Instructions: Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
