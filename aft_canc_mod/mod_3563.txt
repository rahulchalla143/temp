The visible parts of the right lower lung show increase in interstitial markings that could be suggestive of lymphangosis.
There are no pleural effusions.
OSH CT: Informal read here shows RUL cavitary lesion with air fluid levels surrounded by lunch parenchyma.
CLINICAL DATA: H/O NSCLC with new obstructive PNA.
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]  DIAGNOSIS: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Status post obstructive pneumonia.
Status post obstructive pneumonia.
She is a 79-year-old woman with a past history of right hilar nonsmall cell cancer consistent with adenocarcinoma, concurrent radiation and completed treatment in [**2169-5-28**].
She recently developed a call associated with purulent phlegm as well as a febrile state.
Of note, there was circumferential extrinsic compression of the bronchi of the right upper lobe.
Specimens were sent for cytology as well for microbiology including fungal studies.
The patient initially tolerated the procedure well, however during the recovery she developed profound hypercapnia with pCO2 rising to 90 and pH associated with this at 711.
There was a suggestion on her desk that she has a CO2 retainer although this was not known preprocedure.
Likely the further elevation of the CO2 was on the basis of her medications.
The patient tolerated the initial bronchoscopy well but shortly after the patient developed hypoxia and hypercarbia, likely a side effect of the sedation used.
She rapidly improved with resolution of her hypercarbia and significant improvement in her hypoxia within 12 hours.
They felt it would block off more bronchioles than it would open and that the RUL was essentially unsalvagable given the large cavitary lesion seen on CT.
There is also high suspicion of a small bronchopleural fistula, given the return of mesothelial cells on the BAL.
However, the patient did not show any signs pneumothorax on exam or CXR.
In discussion with interventional pulmonary, it was decided not to pursue drainage of the cavity given the concern for cancer recurrence and the creation of a non-healing tract from the puncture site, greatly increasing her pneumothorax risk.
A BAL showed no AFB on concentrated smear, ruling out TB.
She will also return to interventional pulmonary clinic with her CT in hand for follow up of her possible bronchopleural fistula.
Non-small cell lung cancer: The patient was diagnosed with stage IIIb NSCLC in [**4-4**] with chemo/rads treatment completed in [**6-4**].
It is unclear at this time to what extent this RUL process represents a recurrence of her lung cancer as the infectious process is clouding the imaging.
HTN: The patient was initially hypertensive on presentation with SBPs in the 170s with associated anxiety.
Her anxiety was treated with very small doses of Ativan with good effect.
Back/Scapula pain: The patient is s/p surgical correction of a cervical spinal body fracture in [**1-5**] with residual chronic neck/back/scapula pain.
The pain was initially controlled with motrin was noted to be limited by her back pain by physical therapy.
Her pain was then controlled with low dose oxycontin with percocet for break through pain.
of [**Hospital3 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right upper lobe pneumonia Non-small cell lung cancer Hypertension   Discharge Condition: All vital signs stable, afebrile, on room air   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a right upper lobe pneumonia.
The best course of action is to take 6 weeks of antibiotics to treat the pneumonia and then re-evaluate the lung with another CT scan.
Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you experience worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, fevers, chills, severe lightheadedness or any other symptom that concerns you.
