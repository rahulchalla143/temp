Of note the pt was recently admitted to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital on [**2117-1-2**] following a fall at home during which he had a work-up for head trauma and syncope.
ECG at that time revealed RBBB and LAFB.
Hct of 20.7, CT Head without acute intracranial pathology.

No palpitations.
No diaphroses.
The pt has had stable 1 pillow orthopnea and has DOE upon walking up one flight of stairs.
ED exam was notabable for absent BS on right.
CXR with low lung volumes on right.
CT chest revealed effusion on right with mild ascites.
No signs of acute bleed.
Initial pH 7.08, pleural LDH of 468 indicative of an exudative process thus a pigtail catheter was placed.

EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
Pleural fluid Cx [**1-12**] NTD Pleural fluid: wbc 2550 with 89%PMNs, LDH 468, pH 7.08 pleural fluid cytology: neg for malignancy Sputum Cx upper flora .
[**1-12**]: CXR Large right pleural effusion, with consequent lower and middle lobe collapse.
CXR [**1-16**]; Two views of the chest demonstrate a large right-sided pleural effusion with atelectasis/consolidation of the right lower lobe.
There is little interval change with prior studies.
CXR [**1-22**] (post pigtail removal) There is a small right lower lobe pneumothorax.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, are unchanged.
Bibasilar consolidations and right middle lobe opacities are unchanged, as is faint right upper lobe opacity.
Marked decrease in size of now small complex loculated right pleural effusion.
The tip of the catheter remains within the pleural cavity, but the formed pigtail is extrathoracic in location with adjacent subcutaneous emphysema and soft tissue swelling.
Slight increase of small simple left pleural effusion.
Persistent pneumonia with component of coexisting atelectasis of both lower lobes but improved aeration of the right upper and right middle lobes.
Nonspecific ground-glass opacities are noted within the right middle and lower lung which may be related to infection or reexpansion pulmonary edema.
Unchanged hypoattenuating hepatic and splenic lesions as described.
Decreased right pleural effusion, now moderate in size, status post right pleural pigtail catheter placement.
Small left pleural effusion.
Multifocal pneumonia involving nearly the entire right lung, and large portions of the left lower lobe.
Large right pleural effusion with resultant compressive atelectasis or the right lung.
Splenic hypodensity, not fully characterized, possible hamartoma or hemangioma.
Nodularity of the left adrenal gland, but no distinct nodule.
This finding should be correlated clinically and if indicated, with serum biochemical markers.
Collection of fluid and gas at the thoracic inlet in the region of the esophagus, a finding which predisposes the patient to possible aspiration and should be clinically correlated.
No hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.
Unchanged renal cysts and prostatic enlargement.

Brief Hospital Course: 78 year old male (retired english professor) with h/o myelofibrosis/anemia (transfusion dependent, dx [**2114**]), longstanding zenker's diverticulum with chronic aspiration and recurrent aspiration pneumonias admitted on [**1-12**] with the same.
Aspiration Pneumonia: Patient was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with significant RLL PNA with pleural effusion and hypotension.
He underwent thoracentesis with resultant exudative fluid, and a chest tube was placed with resultant drainage of 3L of fluid and removal of the catheter on [**2117-1-22**].
The plan is for endoscopic repair of his Zenker's diverticulum by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 1837**].
Anemia [**1-26**] Myelofibrosis: Patient received intermittent transfusions to maintain a Hct>22 (is also transfusion dependent as an outpatient).
Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count began to trend down during the last week of hospitalization, thought to be [**1-26**] increased splenic congestion in the setting of volume overload while on TPN.
5.Acute renal failure: Patient noted to have ARF on admission, which improved with IVFs to Cr=0.8.
However, he once again developed ARF on [**1-21**] (peak creat 1.7) likely from volume depletion as well, which again improved with hydration.
Sacral decubitus ulcer: Patient has a stage II sacral ulcer and was getting wound care and turning frequently.

You were treated with antibiotics with improvement in your symptoms and completed these on [**2117-1-26**].
The chest tube had some trouble draining but we were able to fix this with TPA and it drained about 3L of fluid and your breathing improved.
The cause of your pneumonia is due to recurrent aspiration, in part due to your large zenker's diverticulum.
This was thought to be due to splenic congestion due to volume overload.
