On that admission, she was also found to have the flu, and was treated empirically for PNA and UTI with azithro/cefpodoxime/flagyl.
She had 2 BM with maroon stools as well as bright red blood per rectum.

A left chest wall dual lead pacemaker is present with leads in the right atrium and right ventricle.
The head shadow obscures the superior aspect of the lung apices.
No parenchymal opacities are present.
Approximately 10 cc of purulent material was returned.
The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.
FINDINGS:  There is a large stone and sludge seen within the gallbladder.
In addition, there is circumferential gallbladder wall edema and apparent thickening of the wall up to 12 mm.
No intrahepatic ductal dilation is seen.
No free fluid is seen in the right upper quadrant.
There is no hydronephrosis in either kidney.
The liver itself appears slightly increased in echogenicity consistent with fatty infiltration.
No obvious liver masses are seen.
IMPRESSION:  Sludge and stone within the gallbladder with apparent gallbladder wall edema up to 12 mm.
The gallbladder is not distended and there is no biliary dilation.
These findings are concerning for cholecystitis.
FINDINGS:  This study was extremely limited due to body habitus.
There is mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
The gall bladder is mildly distended and contends extensive sludge.
There is marked gallbladder wall edema although this seems slightly decreased compared to prior ultrasound on [**2121-12-2**].
Evaluation of the liver is extremely limited.
There is a small right-sided pleural effusion.
A color Doppler images of the gallbladder show no increased flow in the gallbladder wall.
IMPRESSION:  Very limited study due to body habitus; persistent mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
There is gallbladder wall edema with significant amount of sludge in the gallbladder lumen.
... Repeat U/S [**12-8**]: INDICATION: 79-year-old woman with cholangitis with persistent elevated bilirubin.
Assess for ductal dilatation.
No  intrahepatic ductal dilatation is seen.
No biliary dilatation.
... ERCP on [**12-3**]: Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
There were no complications.
Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary and pancreatic ducts was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
The course and caliber of the duct are normal with no evidence of filling defects, masses, chronic pancreatitis or other abnormalities.
Recommendations: If clinically suitable should have stent exchange in 3 months Return to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] under care of Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 6633**] Continue IV antibiotics  .. [**12-6**] cardiac echo: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly-to-moderately depressed (ejection fraction 40 percent) secondary to hypokinesis of the anterior septum, anterior free wall, and apex.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape unavailable for review) of [**2120-10-1**], no major change is evident.
The absence of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis if clinically suggested.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 6634**] is a 79 year old woman with mmp admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU with fevers, hypotension, jaundice, lethargy, GIB, liver mass.
Broad spectrum abx were maintained.
ERCP on [**12-3**] with frank pus,  stent placement(intubated for procedure with quick extubation.)
Patient's crit was relatively stable throughout admission after she was admitted with prior reported maroon stools, guiaic positive--no frank GI bleeding throughout admission.
Given family and patient's prior expressed wishes, and extreme burden of her illness involving multi-organ failure with liver mass in an extremely high risk surgical patient, and the patient's overall extremely poor prognosis decision was made to make patient CMO.
