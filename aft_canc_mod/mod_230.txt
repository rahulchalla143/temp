Brief Hospital Course: 85M MDS/CMML with colon cancer, status post resection complicated by ileotomy requiring ileostomy placement, here for cholecystectomy (for cholecystitis) and ileostomy takedown.
Patient presented with abdominal pain and had radiological findings consistent with cholecystitis.
Patient initially tolerated the procedure well, however post-operative course was complicated by hypotension requiring transfer to the surgical ICU.
Patient was found to have bilateral pulmonary consolidations with sputum notable for methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and klebisiella, therefore, vancomycin and meropenem were administered for treatment based upon susceptibility profiles.
Subsequently, patient went into acute renal failure, felt to be secondary to episode of hypotension - medications were adjusted for renal dosing.
Of note, at one point during post-op course, wound was thought to be draining purulent material, however, this was self-limited, and at the time of discharge, patient's wound had development of excellent granulation tissue and no evidence of infection.
On hospital day 17, patient was noted to have a white count elevation to 60, which prompted an infectious workup, although patient had no clinical signs or symptoms of infection or fever.
CT scan revealed no abdominal pathology, however, patient was noted to have large pleural effusions bilaterally, right greater than left, consistent with patient's subjective complaints of dyspnea.
On hospital day 18, patient underwent thoracentesis of the right pleural space, removing 2 liters of serosanguinous fluid (negative for bacterial growth and few neutrophils).
Right lung expanded appropriately, although patient continued to remain intermittently dyspneic, thought to be due to continued resolving fluid overload, as patient remained afebrile throughout rest of hospital course.
Patient was grossly volume overloaded, but began mobilizing as renal function recovered.
* Increased WBC: Patient has a history of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, treated with minimal doses of prednisone.
Patient was noted to have a sharp elevation of white count on multiple occasions during hospitalization.
In discussion with patient's primary hematologist, as infectious causes were ruled out, it was felt that these elevations (to max 60,000, ~30% monocytes) were due to exaggerated white cell production/mobilization secondary to chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.
* Anemia/Hemolysis:  Patient was found to have elevated LDH 377, with haptoglobin <20, however, no schistocytes on smear and no elevation in coagulation factors were noted.
However, patient did require two units of packed red cells over the course of the week prior to discharge, felt to be required secondary to combination of low grade hemolysis (from infection), CMML, and myelodysplastic syndrome.
At the time of discharge, patient's respiratory status was excellent (requiring minimal oxygen), had no signs or symptoms of infection or abdominal pathology, and was eager to pursue aggressive physical rehabilitation.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 979**] - [**Location (un) 246**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Congestive heart failure Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia Hypotension Acute renal failure MRSA/Klebsiella Pneumonia Cholecystitis, now status post cholecystectomy Colon cancer, now status post resection and ileostomy takedown   Discharge Condition: Fair- still edematous and with 2L nasal cannula O2 requirement  Discharge Instructions: Follow up with primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
Please call your primary care physician if you have fever, chills, severe abdominal pain, or increasing shortness of breath.
Some shortness of breath is expected as your lungs recover from the pneumonia.
However, if your oxygen requirement begins to increase, you may need to see a doctor.
