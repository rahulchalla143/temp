RADIOLOGY  Final Report CT RECONSTRUCTION  [**2120-8-28**] 4:02 AM CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST; CT RECONSTRUCTION Reason: eval for [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 77 year old man with fall and head trauma, ?
INDICATION: Fall and head trauma and C-spine injury on outside CT and MRI, evaluate fracture.
There is a minimally displaced fracture through the spinous process of C4 extending to the posterior arch of C4.
Minimally displaced fractures of the tips of the spinous processes of C5.
Mildly displaced fracture of the spinous process of C7.
There is malalignment of the component vertebrae at C4-5, with grade 1 retrolisthesis of C4 on C5 and with marked widening of the intervertebral disc space anteriorly.
There is additional widening of the intervertebral disc space anteriorly at C6-7.
There is marked narrowing of the spinal canal at C4-5 due to retrolisthesis of C4 on C5 and angulation of the spine at this level.
In addition, there is a suggestion of hyperdensity within the widened intervertebral disc spaces at C4-5 and C6-7 as well as within the prevertebral soft tissues, possibly representing hematoma.
There is an additional questionable linear lucency within the anterior inferior aspect of the C2 vertebra on the sagittal views only without clear correlate on the axial views, finding that could represent artifact Vs. a nondisplaced fracture.
The visualized portions of the lung apices appear unremarkable.
Cervical spine malalignment of C4-5 and C6-7, with retrolisthesis and intervertebral disc space widening at C4-5 and disc space widening at C6-7, and spinal stenosis.
The findings are highly suggestive of ligamentous injury at these locations.
Marked expansion of the prevertebral soft tissues consistent with hematoma and edema.
Questionable artifact Vs. nondisplaced fracture of the anterior inferior corner of C2 vertebra, seen on the sagittal reconstructions only.
