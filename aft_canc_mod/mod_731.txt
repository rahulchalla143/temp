[**7-4**] CXR: Interval development of diffuse multifocal mass-like nodular airspace opacification that is concerning for pneumonia or Wegner's granulomatosis though areas of aspirated hemorrhage also remains in the differential diagnosis.
[**7-7**] CXR IMPRESSION: Mild improvement in diffuse opacification involving the right hemithorax, though with increased atelectatic change.
Worsened left-sided retrocardiac opacification representing atelectasis and/or pneumonia.
There is plate-like atelectasis in the right mid lung zone.
There is left lower lobe consolidation.
There is little change since the prior study.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 y/o male with HTN, HLD, and reactive airways disease who presented with severe CAP requiring intubation, now extubated and improving from a respiratory standpoint, with resolving delerium.
# Severe CAP vs. VAP; hypoxic respiratory failure: admitted for severe community acquired pneumonia.
CXR showed "diffuse multifocal mass-like nodular airspace opacification that is concerning for pneumonia or Wegner's granulomatosis though areas of aspirated hemorrhage also remains in the differential diagnosis."
His was maintained on levaquin/ceftriaxone/vancomycin until [**7-9**] when he had leucocytosis and ?increased secretions.
His MRSA screen was negative and he does not have any clear MRSA risks at baseline.
Patient was continued on prn albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers, but does not have clear COPD/asthma history.
# Confusion: resolved.
Given acute onset and waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] course, suspect ICU delirium.
Of note, severe infection (though resolving) likely played a role.
Patient had one episode at night where he became acutely agitated and pulled out his PICC line.
# Atrial fibrillation - not in RVR; takes atenolol at home.
# HTN - on multiple agents at home.
BP agents initially held in setting of infection, but once patient's infection was resolving, he was placed back on his home amlodipine 10 mg daily and his atenolol.
# Leukocytosis: improving on discharge and likely from resolving pneumonia.
U/A with hematuria, but without evidence of infection on U/A or Ucx.
Etiology of leukocytosis either severe CAP vs. VAP.
# Diarrhea: resolved.
Had increasing BMs, not initially noticed because of flexiseal.
# remote h/o EtOH abuse: has not been drinking recently.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: 1. severe community vs. ventilatory acquired pneumonia 2. delerium .
SECONDARY: 1. atrial fibrillation 2. hypertension 3. dyslipidemia 4. elevated PSA   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath and severe pneumonia requiring a breathing tube in the ICU.
Please seek medical attention for worsening fevers, chills, nightsweats, cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, chest pain, abdominal pain, confusion, or any other concerning symptoms.
