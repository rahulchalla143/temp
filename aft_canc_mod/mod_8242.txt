Bilateral small amount of pleural effusion is unchanged, more on the right.
The prosthesis in the left humerus and severe changes in the right humerus are stable as well.
Increased prominence of the azygos contour and increased right basilar hazy opacity reflect increasing asymmetric pulmonary edema, right greater than left.
Small right pleural effusion has increased in size, and a small left pleural effusion is stable.

EKG [**2127-6-24**] Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities persist.
EKG [**2127-6-26**] Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response RSR' in V1 Generalized low QRS voltages Since previous tracing of [**2127-6-25**], no significant change .

There are persistent bilateral pleural effusions which are unchanged, right greater than left.
Mild interstitial prominence is seen, which is stable.
IMPRESSION:  No interval change.
Persistent cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural effusions and slight interstitial pulmonary prominence.
CTA OF THE CHEST: There is significant interval worsening of bilateral pleural effusions, now moderate in size and right greater than left.
There is bilateral basilar atelectasis.
The pulmonary vasculature is opacified without evidence of intraluminal filling defects to suggest the presence of pulmonary embolism.
No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy is seen.
Several medistinal lymph nodes do not meet size criteria for pathologic enlargement.
There are bilateral nodules within the thyroid lobes.
The partially visualized upper abdominal organs are notable for abdominal ascites around the liver.
Bone windows demonstrate severe degenerative changes in the thoracic spine, but no evidence of suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral basilar atelectasis.
Abdominal ascites.
ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY)  [**2127-7-2**] 10:19 AM  SUPINE ABDOMINAL RADIOGRAPH: There are mildly dilated loops of small bowel as well as air seen in the ascending, descending, and transverse colon.
There is no evidence of obstruction.
The patient is status post prior vertebroplasty of a lower thoracic vertebra.
There is a right-sided bipolar hemiarthroplasty.
No bilateral pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction.
The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2127-7-6**] 11:08 AM  IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**6-29**] and 14:  Small left and moderate right pleural effusion have improved since [**6-29**].
Although this could be asymmetric edema, the simultaneous improvement in effusions suggest that this is pneumonia instead, quite likely aspiration.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 109973**] is a 76 yo lady with multiple medical problems admitted to the GYN service for TAH/BSO and transferred to the medicine service initially for hypotension post op and later for A.fib with RVR and CHF.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course: The pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for management of post-op (s/p TAH/BSO for endometrial ca) hypotension in the setting of post-op sedation.
She was noted to have a HCT drop (43->35) after fluid resuscitation.
The pt had very poor peripheral access so a R IJ was placed for fluid resuscitation.
Her repeat HCT showed a further drop.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test was negative for adrenal insufficiency.
On the day after admission, the pt's EKG was significant for uniformly low voltages in all leads.
A cardiac ECHO showed moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, a moderate sized pericardial effusion (echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements) with no evidence of tamponade; these findings have been noted on previous ECHO dating back to 10/[**2125**].
The pt's CXR was significant for increased mild asymmetric pulmonary edema (R>L), with increasing small R pleural effusion.
It was thought that her hypotension was likely due to iatrogenic narcotic use, and these were tapered off as tolerated.
Patient had tachy episodes to 150s-170s x 2 on [**6-25**] & [**6-26**], EKGs showing afib w/RVR.
Patient remained tachy to 120s on [**6-28**], per cards changed Toprol to Lopressor 50mg PO TID, titrate to 75 mg TID for adequate beta blockade.
CXR on [**6-29**] CXR showing effusion and cardiomegaly unchanged from prior.
Patient known to have restrictive lung dz [**2-20**] to b/l pleural effusions and DOE and is followed in [**Hospital **] clinic, who recommended home O2 w/exertion, however pt declined use of home O2 in the past.
The decision was made to transfer the patient to the medicine service for further management of her shortness of breath as well as difficult to control A.fib with RVR.
# Sob/Hypoxia: Likely Multifactorial given patient with known lung disease, b/l pleural effusions, stable pericardial effusion, CHF and volume overload, A.fib with RVR and platypnea-orthodeoxia (see below).
PE was ruled out with CTA given patient was post op with tachycardia and SOB.
This was negative for infection and was consistent with a transudative process.
# Platypnea-Orthodeoxia: Very unclear etiology.
Other potential work up as an outpatient may include [**Name (NI) 5283**] son[**Name (NI) **] or V/Q scan to assess for cirrhosis (unlikely) or vascular shunts.
Upon transfer to the medicine service the patient was clearly volume overloaded post op and after receiving fluids in the ICU.
RHYTHM: A.fib with RVR, SSS s/p PPM.
Patient with chronic A.fib not on anticoagulation due to fall risk.
Patient did not experience any chest discomfort but did have baseline shortness of breath.
No evidence of ischemia, no CP although patient has dyspnea on exertion likely secondary to her above pulmonary disease.
# Endometrial CA: s/p tab/bso and lymph node dissection, followed by GYN service.
# Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, TEDS, Heparin SC TID, ambulation, po diet .
Lactulose 10 g/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO every [**6-26**] hours as needed for constipation.
Ipratropium Bromide 18 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: [**1-20**] Inhalation every 6-8 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
