Patient transferred from nursing home with little documentation but apparently has been having increasing confusion over the past 1 week with associated fatigue and more agitated today prompting presentation.
When daughter came to see patient today however, patient was seemingly having episodes when his eyes would roll back and be unresponsive and this is the first time his daughter has seen him like this.
This was associated with tachycardia to 130s and following lorazepam HR dropped to 90s-100s.
Per records last seizure was in [**2138-2-12**] when he had twitching on right side of his face and arm and prior semiologies have included EPC admission in [**2136**] with abnormal tongue movements.
Patient was recently admitted under surgery and discharged [**2138-5-23**] after abdominal pain with chronic constipation issues and stenosis of distal sigmoid colon and improved with laxatives with a CT on admission did not show any acute process.
Unable to perform full neuro ROS due to patient's mental status but speech is dysarthric and had noted right arm heaviness and has been having intermittent unresponsiveness intermixed as above with confused at best speech.
Patient had not noted any nausea or vomiting, diarrhea or cough/sputum or SOB.
Past Medical History: - HTN - Dementia - Depression - Partial epilepsy followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 623**] previous right face and arm twitching on keppra - History of epilepsia partialis continua consisting of rhythmic mouth movements diagnosed in [**2136-5-12**] and has since been maintained on Keppra monotherapy.
EEG at the time showed periodic beta frequency rhythmic spike activity in the frontocentral regions that correlated with rhythmic movements of the mouth consistent with myoclonus.
MRI of the head that showed chronic small vessel ischemic changes, but no acute pathological abnormality.
- Leukocytosis: Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 10810**] but after hem c/s was noted to have JAK2 V617F MUTATION positive (other mutations negative) and  he has been suggested to have underlying hematologic process and  recommended evaluation with hem as an outpatient which appears still not to have been done.
- Right hemicolectomy in [**2123**] for colon cancer-s/p chemo with multiple SBO's ([**3-19**], [**4-19**], [**5-19**], [**7-19**]), then LOA [**9-19**], complicated by peritonitis s/p Abx - Chronic L common femoral vein thrombosis and IVC thrombosis s/p  IVC filter placement - Osteoporosis - Cholecystectomy - B/l small inguinal hernias   Social History: He is [**Location 7972**] speaking.
Mobility: Generally wheelchair bound but can use walker for limited distances.
Family History: Daughter is unsure of his parents' health problems but has 3 sisters who [**Name2 (NI) 18466**] well without MI, stroke or cancer.
Per previous documentation: Hx of early strokes (-) Seizures (-) CNS tumors (-) Demyelinating conditions (-) Autoimmune conditions (-) Procoagulant conditions (-) CAD (-)  Per history from daughter, there is no history of seizures, developmental disability, learning disorders, migraine headaches, strokes less than 50, neuromuscular disorders, or movement disorders.

Neurological examination:  - Mental Status: Drowsy and initially unresponsive making mouth-blowing/chewing motions.
Funduscopic exam reveals no evidence of papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages but difficult to assess retina in a more detailed fashion due to patient cooperation.
III, IV, VI: Full range of eye moevments tracking grandson's face with several beats of end-gaze nystagmus bilaterally in abduction.
Dysarthric speech.
IX, X: Unable to assess due to poor cooperation.

Prelim radiology read: no acute intracranial process.
Last CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2137-12-3**] 7:29 PM FINDINGS:  A stable hypodensity is seen in the right cerebellar hemisphere compatible with a chronic lacunar infarction.
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are stable, compatible with chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.
Chronic small vessel infarction.
There were frequent rapid transitions from wakefulness to stage II sleep, and the patient spent most of the recording in sleep.
If the patient is not sleep deprived or under the effect of sedative medications the excessive sleepiness might represent an underlying sleep disorder.
No epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures were present.
Other Radiology:  KUB [**2138-6-9**]: Gaseous distention of the stomach and a loop of small bowel, findings which could represent an early small bowel obstruction.
CXR [**2138-6-9**] My real possible mild congetsive changes.
Slight linesr opacities ?
bilateral atelecctasis and bowel gas from abdomen obscuring left CP angle.
Prelim rads read: IMPRESSION: No free air under the diaphragms.
Low lung volumes with Preliminary Reportbibasilar atelectasis.
Probable small left pleural effusion.
focal dilation of small bowel in the upper mid abdomen to 4.0cm may represent focal ileus.
no acute intra-abdominal process.
Diffuse non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2138-5-22**] there is no diagnostic change.
[**2138-6-9**]: CXR: IMPRESSION:  No free air under the diaphragms.
Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
Probable small left pleural effusion.
[**2138-6-9**] AXR: IMPRESSION:  Gaseous distention of the stomach and a loop of small bowel, findings which could represent an early small bowel obstruction.
Focal dilation of the proximal jejunum without a definite transition point, could represent an early or partial small bowel obstruction.
Chronic IVC occlusion below the level of the IVC filter with collateral formation, similar to the prior study.
Unchanged vertebral body compression deformities.
No acute intracranial process.
Increased mucosal thickening in the left sphenoid sinus since [**2137-12-3**].
[**2138-6-10**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of a mild diffuse encephalopathy.
There were no clear focal or lateralizing features and no clear epileptic activity either of an interictal or ictal nature.
[**2138-6-11**] EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of mild diffuse slowing compatible with either multifocal disease or a mild encephalopathy.
No paroxysmal interictal activity was noted no focal abnormalities clearly identified.
[**2138-6-11**] AXR:  Two supine frontal views and a single left lateral decubitus view of the abdomen demonstrate an IVC filter in place.
Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen are consistent with prior cholecystectomy.
The bowel gas pattern is nonspecific with several gas-filled borderline dilated loops of small bowel with a stacked appearance in the right lower abdomen.
Multiple small air-fluid levels are noted on the corresponding lateral decubitus film.
There is no evidence of free intraperitoneal air.
Extensive degenerative changes are noted throughout the visualized thoracolumbar spine with marginal osteophyte formation and loss of intervertebral disc space.
A radiodense irregularity projecting over the left ilium corresponds to a calcification in the gluteal muscle on prior CT.    Brief Hospital Course: Initial Assessment: 94RHM PMH of resected colon cancer in [**2125**] s/p chemo with multiple SBO's, HTN, dementia, partial epilepsy, chronic L common femoral vein thrombosis and IVC thrombosis s/p IVC filter placement, depression and leukocytosis JAK2 positive presents with increasing confusion, fatigue, hallucinations and agitation now with intermittent unresponsiveness and mouth movements/right sided twitching and slurred speech.
On examination patient intermittently unresponsive and making mouth blowing and chewing motions and latterly saying some comprehensible speech but this was only isolated words and very dysarthric.
On CN exam, PERRL and several beats of end-gaze nystagmus bilaterally.
Right plantar majestic extensor and left less prominently extensor.
Latterly somnolent again following Keppra load and lorazepam but grimacing all 4 limbs and some purposeful movement to noxious bilaterally in setting of returned tachycardia up to 140s requiring IV diltiazem which then settled to 80s and hemodynamically stable.
Labs reveal elevated WCC 24 WBC high in the past but not generally as high as today (range 11-24 [last 24 in [**2136**]]) thrombocythemia is chronic and has had worsening renal function since [**4-/2138**] now Cr 1.5.
CXR shows bilateral atelectasis.
CT head shows no acute ischemic changes but significant atrophy and old left corona radiata lacune.
AXR showed concern for possible SBO but CT abdomen shows possible ileus but no evidence of obstruction on prelim read.
History is suggestive of progressive delirium over 1 week with confusion and hallucinations but today's fluctuating mental status with associated tachycardia and lateralised twitching likely represents complex partial seizures which may have been triggered by intercurrent infection (note borderline UA and treatment for infection with levofloxacin), concurrent levofloxacin started [**6-6**] lowering seizure threshold and possibly getting inadequate AED dosing although depending on which nurse was talked to the patient may have been getting half or regular dose of his levetiracetam at his nursing home.
Surgery were happy for patient to be admitted to neurology with no intervention required from their perspective due to concerns of possible SBO.
Mental status deteriorated again post Keppra load with patient less responsive and although did have some purposeful movement bilaterally, concern is for possible non-convulsive seizures given concurrent tachycardia although excess sedation from having a Keppra load and lorazepam is also possible but wouuld not explain tachycardia.
After further discussion with chief resident and epilepsy attending we will admit to neuro ICU for LTM and medication titration given persistent poor mental status.
He did not have any active seizure activity during this time.
His altered mental status was likely triggered by his infection as well as by his seizure threshold being lowered by use of quinolones and possibly the flagyl given in the ED as well.
He had ECGs that were unremarkable aside from some episodes of supraventricular tachycardia.
Pulmonary: No acute issues since admission.
His chest xray did show some atelectasis and ?
Has been on room air without difficulty.
He had blood and urine cultures upon admission but they did  not haave any growth.
FENGI: Initially in the ED, there was concern for abdominal pathology and small bowel obstruction due to abdominal distention.
He was noted to have a large bowel movement and flatus in the ED with notable improvement in his abodminal distention.
Surgery consult noted that there was no acute surgical issue and that the CT was negative for a small bowel obstruction.
While there is some abnormality to the CT, it is unchanged from his previous admission.
He was initially kept NPO, repeat AXR was performed and showed some improvement.
Throughout the hospital course he did have bowel sounds and had a few bowel movements.
The team felt there was no obstruction and that there was no acute surgical issue.
Avoid quinolones or flagyl if possible as these lower seizure threshold.
This can be restarted if his behavior warrants it.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Seizure Urinary Tract Infection   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 12129**], You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**6-9**], [**2138**] for evaluation of altered mental status and slurred speech.
A workup was done for source of infection and you were treated for a urinary tract infection for which you were started on antibiotics by IV.
There was also initially a concern for a small bowel obstruction so you were on IV fluids and not to eat.
As your infection was treated, your mental status improved and you did not have any more seizure activity while you were monitored on EEG.
Dizziness or lightheadedness Numbness or tingling Change in vision Confusion Headache Weakness in arm, leg, or face Difficulty walking Difficulty talking Loss of balance Incontinence of urine or stool Abdominal pain Abdominal swelling Nausea and vomiting Vomiting blood Difficulty swallowing Diarrhea Constipation Blood in stool Black stool It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospital stay.
