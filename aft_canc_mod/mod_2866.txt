Admission Date:  [**2142-7-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-7-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2114-5-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Iodine / Nsaids / Opioid Analgesics  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5806**] Chief Complaint: Acute mastocytosis flare  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right femoral line and peripheral IVs placed, NGT placement attempted  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 28 yo WF with known history of systemic mastocytosis with intermittent flares in the past who presented to ED with an acute episode of flushing, tachycardia, nausea, and vomiting.
The patient stated that 3 days ago she began to notice increasing flushing with palpitations and generalized pruritus.
Prednisone at home with some improvement in her symptoms the following day.
A day later, however, these aforementioned symptoms returned along with nausea and she decided to go to ED.
No recent clear precipitants.
She denies fevers, sick contacts but has been traveling more recently.
Upon arrival to the medical inpatient floor, the patient's status declined and she developed HR 160-170s, SBP 80s, and worsening nausea and vomiting.
Pt had poor access.
n MICU, attempted multiple times to obtain U/S guided PIV, then placed R femoral TLC as patient unable to reliably lie flat for IJ or SCV line due to wretching, nausea and vomiting.
Patient had multiple episodes of coffee ground emesis.
Clinically, however, the patient was not cyanotic or experiencing labored breaths.
CXR was unremakable for any acute cardiopulmonary pathology.
Given PaO2 and clinical picture of patent airway without wheezes or clear distress the team decided not to intubate patient.
It was felt that the patient was protected her airway appropriately despite aspiration risks given multiple episodes of vomiting.
GI consulted for coffee ground emesis.
Most likely etiology for emesis was persistent wretching on the day of admission.
Given that the pt's HCT stabilized and no further episodes of emesis occurred it was felt that GI f/u could be obtained as an outpatient.
Honorably discharged from air force in [**2139**] due to her recurrent mastocytosis flares and hospitalizations.
Family History: Father alive and in good health, mother has MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] family h/o allergic, rheumatologic, or autoimmune diseases.
Physical Exam: Gen: patient's skin diffusely flushed, visibly distressed with wretching, nausea and vomiting HEENT: conjunctiva well perfused, PERRL, EOMI, dry MM, OP clear, no signs of angioedema NECK: Supple, No LAD, No JVD.

A tryptase level was also ordered to assess severity of flare.
Although patient denies any illness, blood and urine cultures were sent to rule out any underlying triggers for mastocytosis exacerbation.
Hypoxia: During acute phase of mastocytosis exacerbation desaturated to 60s on high flow face tent but PaO2 on ABG much more reassuring with levels >100.
Furthermore, patient was without any signs of acute respiratory distress;no lung crackles/wheezes, no SOB, non-elevated JVD on PE.
Hallucinations and Agitation: After 2 days in hospital on high dose Solumedrol the patient experienced hallucinations and overt agitation most likely [**3-3**] high Solumedrol levels and perhaps complicated further by high Diphenhydramine amounts as well.
GI bleed: Initially had multiple episodes of coffee ground emesis which abated by day 2.
Patient appears well-perfused and hemodynamically stable despite her anemia history and dilutional drop in Hgb/Hct values s/p aggressive IVF resuscitation.
Followed Hcts/CBCs and agreed on transfusion cutoff for Hct < 21 but patient's values improved.
GI was consulted due to episodes of bloody, "coffee ground" emesis on admission and agreed to follow patient with urgent EGD if she showed signs of active bleeding but otherwise felt elective EGD once she is out of the ICU would be a reasonable approach to explore etiology once patient more stable.
Initially the patient was double covered with H2B and PPIs due to aspiration risks as per GI advice but was later switched to [**Hospital1 **] PPIs alongside Phenergen and Zofran antiemetics.
Femoral/Groin pain- patient had a right femoral line placed for emergent access during acute episode as she was writhing and unable to be safely positioned for a central line.
After femoral line was removed on day 2 patient c/o pain at removal site of Right Femoral line and was given PO Tylenol for pain.
No active bleeding noted after pressure held for >20mins.
Hematoma noted at site and dressed and monitored daily for any changes.
Leukocytosis: Rise in WBC likely due to demargination after recent solumedrol loads as well as underlying mastocytosis insult.
Patient remained afebrile throughout her stay and blood and urine cultures were sent.
No current signs of active nausea, vomiting or UGI/LGI bleeding.
PPx: Pneumoboots given for DVT prophylaxis and heparin SC held given GI bleed setting, PPIs given for GI PPx  Access: patient had right femoral line in place with PIV during her stay  Code: Full Code status   Medications on Admission: Cetirizine 10mg PO BID Cromolyn 20mg/mL solution, 10mL PO QID Doxepin 50mg PO QAM and 100mg PO QPM EpiPen prn NuvaRing Hydroxyzine 30mg PO TID Ativan 0.5mg PO PRN anxiety Singulair 10mg PO Qdaily Prednisone 50mg Qdaily X7 days PRN mastocytosis flare Ranitidine 150mg PO BID Ferrous sulfate 325mg PO BID  Discharge Medications: 1.
