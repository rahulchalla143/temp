On [**1-16**] he underwent colonoscopy and on [**2-5**] he underwent EGD; colonoscopy was significant for several small polyps, EGD was unremarkable.
He then underwent a barium swallon on [**2171-3-7**], which showed a large gastric ulcer.
On [**2171-3-25**] he underwent a repeat EGD which also showed the 1 cm deep ulcer in the cardia, with surrounding edema and active oozing of blood.
The ulcer was biopsied and injected with epinephrine with partial hemostasis achieved.

Abdominal/Pelvic CT: No significant abnormality is identified in the visualized portions of the lung bases.
A large 13.5 cm x 8.9 cm x 10.5 cm soft tissue mass with central necrosis is visualized in the mid-upper abdomen.
The lesion is in continuity with the lesser curvature of the stomach and abuts the left hepatic lobe without a clear plane of separation.
The lesion also abuts the anterosuperior aspect of the pancreatic head and body.
The lesion encases the left gastric artery but does not involve the celiac artery or hepatic artery.
A 1.8 cm x 1.5 cm area of low attenuation at the gastroesophageal junction (series 3, image 14) most likely represents a small amount of fluid related to hiatus hernia.
No significant abdominal lymphadenopathy is identified.
No focal parenchymal abnormality is seen in the liver, spleen, or adrenal glands.
A 1.5 cm x 1.6 cm exophytic cortical cyst is identified at the lower pole of the left kidney.
No significant small or large bowel dilatation.
A small linear area of hyperattenuation in the lumen of proximal small bowel (series 400b, image 31) most likely represents a tablet or foreign body material.
No pelvic lymphadenopathy is identified.
A few focal areas of calcification are seen in the central portion of the prostate gland.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified in the bony skeleton.
He  was found to have a bleeding gastric ulcer in the cardia which was not reachable for intervention by the endoscopist.
This study showed a very large mass measuring at least 15 cm in size and seemingly arising from the lesser curve of the stomach.
The diagnosis was that the patient had a large gastrointestinal stromal cell tumor that had eroded through the mucosa forming the ulcer.
The  concern was for rupture given the large size and the extensive necrosis.
Neuro: Morphine PCA was utilized immediately post-operative for pain control, this was transitioned to oral medications once the patient was tolerating a liquid diet.
An arterial line was placed during at the time of operation for hemodynamic monitoring.
It was removed on POD #3, and the patient voided without difficulty.
Heme: Hct was checked post-operatively, there was no evidence of bleeding.
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Bleeding gastric ulcer Gastric Mass, concerning for GIST; s/p partial gastrectomy   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
