Multifocal new calcified emboli, the largest lodged within the left M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery which has resulted in a completed infarct of approximately two-thirds of the MCA territory, with a larger penumbra risk involving virtually the entire left MCA distribution.
Extensive multifocal atherosclerotic disease, with approximately 70% stenosis of the proximal left internal carotid artery, and approximately 60% stenosis of the proximal right internal carotid artery.
In the lung parenchyma, there is increasing density at the left lung base, in the retrocardiac lung areas.
No other parenchymal abnormalities are occurred in the meantime.
