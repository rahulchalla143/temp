She initially presented in [**Month (only) 958**] [**2177**] to the heme onc clinic with complaing of neck pain due to bulky lymphadenompathy and CT scan revealed extensive lymphadenopathy, more severe in the deep pelvis, but also involved her paraspinal regions, retroperitoneum, inguinal regions as well as porta hepatis.
She also presented with an elevated creatinine, and kidneys were normal in appearance and there was no evidence of hydronephrosis.
She also had a large neck mass more prominent on the right side.
The patient presented to clinic today with a report of decreased urine output over the last few months and was noted to have elevated creatinine over 7.
She also had increased bilateral leg edema over the past three weeks, dyspnea on exertion, and increased fatigue.
She denied mental confusion, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain or any bloating.
Denied any fever, chills or night sweats.
She otherwise denied any bleeding or bruising difficulties, any numbness or tingling in her fingers or toes.
She's had some difficulty with ambulation due to the edema amd is currently using a cane.
In the ED, her creatinine was significantly elevated (up to 8.1), CXR showed L-sided effusion with atelectasis/failure.
She stated that she has been feeling more short of breath of late and has woken up at times SOB in the middle of the night.
She was currently thinking about whether or not she wants to have hemodialysis and/or chemotherapy for her lymphoma and is admitted at this time for further management.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for monitoring because of high risk of TLS as she agreed to have chemotherapy initiated.
She received the CVP (cytoxan, vincristine, prednisone) regimen with daily hemodialysis without complication.
She was transferred to the medicine service for monitoring for tumor lysis and for continued hemodialysis until outpatient dialysis is arranged.
At that time, she noted increased confusion lately that is worse in the hospital but has been improving in the past few days.
She was tolerating a small amount of renal prudent solid food and drinking nepro supplements.
She denied fever, chills, dysuria, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or distention.

no petechiae.
CXR [**2179-2-5**]: L sided pleural effusion with discoid atelectasis, failure; right paratracheal mass .
CXR [**2179-2-13**]: No significant change since prior study.
Persistent bilateral atelectases and bibasilar consolidations as described.
No pneumothorax.
Renal US: no hydronephrosis; ?parenchymal renal disease .
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2179-2-10**] 1) Marked progression of diffuse systemic lymphadenopathy, particularly in the retroperitoneum and pelvis.
2) Diffuse soft tissue edema, bilateral pleural effusions, ascites, and right atrial enlargement, all consistent with fluid overload/anasarca.
[**Last Name (un) **] DUP EXTEXT BIL (MAP/DVT)  [**2179-2-15**] Duplex ultrasonography was performed at the level of the veins and arteries of the bilateral upper extremities.
Discharge Labs: BLOOD WBC-3.0* RBC-2.80* Hgb-8.9* Hct-27.3* MCV-97 MCH-31.7 MCHC-32.5 RDW-16.6* Plt Ct-158 PT-16.7* PTT-30.3 INR(PT)-1.8 Fibrino-187 Glucose-90 UreaN-32* Creat-4.1* Na-133 K-3.7 Cl-99 HCO3-28 AnGap-10 Calcium-8.8 Phos-3.3 UricAcd-5.6  Brief Hospital Course: Acute Renal failure: The etiology of the acute renal failure is unclear but likely lymphomatous infiltration, urate nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, or acute tubular necrosis that may be reversible after dialysis and reduction of her tumor burden.
She had a renal biopsy on [**2-9**] that showed glomerular sclerosis consistent with end stage disease, likely from the lymphoma.
Urine lytes were consistent with renal pathology.
Renal ultrasound was without signs of hydronephrosis.
She decided to pursue treatment for her lymphoma, so a tunnelled dialysis catheter was placed in the interventional radiology suite, and she commenced hemodialysis on [**2-11**].
Tumor lysis and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy laboratory testing were stabilized at discharge and will be monitored at hemodialysis.
Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma: It is low grade but she has significant disease, including bulky cervical lymphadenopathy.
Staging CT showed extensive disease.
Tumor lysis and DIC labs were monitored and were stabilized at discharge, although they were briefly moderately positive the week after completing chemotherapy.
Platelets and hematocrit briefly decreased secondary to chemotherapy.
She did not require cryoprecipitate, FFP, or platelet transfusion and had no acute bleeding.
Verapamil and Atenolol were continued for rate control of atrial fibrillation.
Anemia labs were consistent with anemia of chronic disease/inflammation.
A health care proxy was designated (her daughter) in the event that she has complications of her disease at any point in the future.
