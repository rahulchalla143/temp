Admission Date:  [**2196-11-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2196-11-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2126-9-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**] Chief Complaint: BRBPR   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Flexible sigmoidoscopy Colonoscopy Degarelix treatment Red blood cell transfusions   History of Present Illness: 76 y/oM with PMH afib on coumadin, new onset RLE swelling, and imaging suggestive on likely metastatic prostate CA who presented to the ED with BRBPR.
Patient complains of intermittent BRBPR x 1 month which acutely worsened in the past several days to multiple frank bloody stools.
No accompanying abdominal discomfort, fever or nausea/ vomiting.
No history of GI bleed, but patient has a history of hemorrhoids and has never had a colonoscopy.
Notes fatigue but denies any accompanying chest pain, SOB, lightheadedness, or other complaints.
Of note, this occurred in the setting of new onset lower extremity swelling with right > left.
CT scan to further evaluate did not show any evidence of DVT but revealed large prostate mass with bulky lymphadenopathy causing hydronephrosis.
Over the past several days to weeks, he notes increasing back pain similar to prior exacerbation of spinal stenosis.
He denies any associated saddle anesthesia or bowel incontinence but does have worsening urinary retention.
Past Medical History: - epiglottitis - Afib on coumadin - HTN - tonsillectomy - seasonal allergies - spinal stenosis .

Excavated Lesions Multiple diverticula were seen in the whole colon.
Impression: Diverticulosis of the whole colon Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations: Diverticula and hemorrhoids noted.
Given two month hx of rectal bleeding consideration of related to hemorrhoidal bleeding.
Protruding Lesions Non-bleeding grade 1 internal hemorrhoids were noted.
Other Mild scope trauma visualized in the rectum.
No source of hematochezia identified.
Impression: Stool in the rectum and sigmoid colon Mild scope trauma visualized in the rectum.
No source of hematochezia identified.
Limited study given stool but no active bleeding or lesion noted to 40 cm.
Bone Scan: INTERPRETATION: Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and posterior projections as well as spot images of the arms.
There is increased uptake at approximately L3 on the right and L5 on the left; on the CT of [**2196-11-23**] there are degenerative changes in these locations which may account for these findings.
There is increased uptake at approximately the 10th costovertebral junction on the right, likely degenerative.
There are no other bony findings.
There is increased soft tissue uptake which may relate to edema.
The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer excretion.
The ureters are displaced medially and have intense tracer activity.
No previous studies for comparison.
There is associated bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter.
Findings are highly concerning for metastatic lymphadenopathy, and differential considerations include lymphoma and prostate carcinoma, given the enlarged and heterogeneous appearance of the prostate.
Colonic diverticulosis.
Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
No evidence of bowel obstruction, as questioned.
The pattern is concerning for early or partial obstruction.
A high-density oval structure in the right lower quadrant is likely retained contrast in the cecum or barium in a giant cecal diverticulum.
Gallstone ileus is unlikely given the lack of air in the biliary tree and the appearance of this density.
IMPRESSION: Pattern concerning for early or partial obstruction, less likely gallstone ileus.
Obstruction might be caused by retained contrast in the cecum or a large cecal diverticulum.
LENI: FINDINGS:  Grayscale and Doppler images of the right and left common femoral, right superficial femoral, right popliteal were obtained.
Subcutaneous edema is noted along the calf.
IMPRESSION:  No DVT in right lower extremity.
EKG [**11-21**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
Since the previous tracing of [**2196-7-7**] the rate is faster  [**11-26**]: Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2196-11-21**] there is no diagnostic change  Discharge Labs:  [**2196-11-29**] 06:40AM BLOOD WBC-4.8 RBC-3.28* Hgb-9.8* Hct-29.8* MCV-91 MCH-29.9 MCHC-32.9 RDW-14.7 Plt Ct-372 [**2196-11-28**] 04:14PM BLOOD Hct-32.2* [**2196-11-25**] 07:13AM BLOOD PT-15.6* PTT-24.9 INR(PT)-1.4* [**2196-11-28**] 06:55AM BLOOD Glucose-91 UreaN-17 Creat-1.0 Na-141 K-4.3 Cl-106 HCO3-29 AnGap-10 [**2196-11-29**] 06:40AM BLOOD Glucose-97 UreaN-21* Creat-1.0 Na-141 K-4.4 Cl-106 HCO3-29 AnGap-10 [**2196-11-28**] 06:55AM BLOOD ALT-21 AST-36 LD(LDH)-248 AlkPhos-71 TotBili-0.9 [**2196-11-26**] 07:40AM BLOOD Calcium-8.7 Phos-3.3 Mg-1.6  Brief Hospital Course: 76 y/oM with PMH afib on coumadin, new onset RLE swelling, and imaging suggestive on likely metastatic prostate CA who presented to the ED with bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR), no active bleeding on colonoscopy, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular reponse (RVR) that was rate controlled, presumed metastatic colon cancer treated with degarelix, and urinary retention secondary to an enlarged prostate treated with a foley and tamsulosin.
# BRBPR: Required 3 blood transfusions while in the ICU, initial flex sigmoidoscopy was negative for active bleeding.
Colonoscopy to cecum showed no active bleeding, but did reveal hemorrhoids and diverticulosis.
Patient did have 2 episodes of mild BRBPR while on the floor with bowel movements thought to be secondary to hemorrhoids and straining with bowel movements.
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Initially elevated HR to 160s, treated with fluids and esmolol drip in ICU.
Patient was tachycardic with ambulation so metoprolol was increased to 75mg TID.
# Urinary Retention: Initial attempt at foley insertion was unsuccessful and caused bleeding from urethral meatus.
Foley was removed 3 days prior to d/c, however patient was having frequent small voids thought to be overflow.
# Presumed metastatic Prostate cancer: CT scan in [**10/2196**] showing enlarged prostatic mass, bulky lymphadenopathy obscuring neurovasculature (likely cause of RLE edema), and likely liver mets.
Radiation-Oncology was consulted and felt no acute intervention was needed.
A bone scan was done which showed no bony lesions.
# Psoriasis - Did flare while in hospital, but resolved once patient applied home steroid ointment.
You were admitted with bleeding from your rectum.
We do not think that you need to be on coumadin for your atrial fibrillation as you are low risk for a stroke.
