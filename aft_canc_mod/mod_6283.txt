Admission Date:  [**2148-4-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2148-4-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2092-5-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**] Chief Complaint: Transfer for high-dose methotrexate.
A head MRI of the brain showed a tectal mass and three areas of nodular enhancement on the ventricular surfaces, concerning for brain metastases with ventricular seeding.
She underwent a stereotactic biopsy on [**2148-4-22**] which was consistent with high-grade B-cell lymphoma.
CT of the torso on [**2148-4-24**] did not show a distinct primary site, only some subcentimeter left axillary lymph nodes.
She does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
Neck Supple, No LAD, No thyromegaly.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
No HSM EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
Extraocular movements are full; there is no saccadic intrusion or nystagmus.
Funduscopic examination reveals sharp disks margins bilaterally, and there is spontaneous venous pulsations.
Motor Examination: She does not have a drift.
She does not have a Romberg.
Pertinent Results: MRI Brain, Pre Methotrexate: Three areas of abnormal nodular enhancement on ventricular surfaces, including 9.4 mm nodule on the dorsal mid brain, and small foci of abnormal enhancement in the anterior aspect of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of each lateral ventricle.
Most probably, these abnormalities represent metastatic disease with ventricular seeding.
Although the lesion in the tegmentum appears somewhat infiltrative, a glioma would be less likely to seed the ventricle, much less likely would be a process such as lymphoma, or granulomatous disease such as sarcoidosis or tuberculosis.
MRI Brain, Post Methotrexate (Preliminary Read): Marked improvment in dominant midbrain lesion, now diminished to 3-4mm slightly heterogenously enhancing nodule with no hydrocephalus or aqueduct stenosis.
edema surounding midbrain lesion markedly improved with less improvement to regions of edema surrounding bifrontal periventricular nodules.
New right precentral parenchymal edema appears post procedural as due small foci of microhemmorhage along biopsy tract.
No definite evidence for a primary tumor.
Subcentimeter lymph nodes seen within the left axilla.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 77782**] is a 55F with metastatic lymphoma to the brain being transferred to the OMED service for methotrexate.
She underwent her first round of methotrexate treatment without complications.
A follow up MRI showed diminished size of her midbrain lesion and overal edema.
If you develop any concerning symptoms such as headaches, worsening of your vision, intractable vomiting, or sudden weakness, please return to the emergency department to be evaluated.
