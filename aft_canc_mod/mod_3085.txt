HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54-year-old male with known horseshoe kidney who was first seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2187-10-21**] for a second opinion of high-grade stage T1 transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.
He had repeat biopsies that raised the question of possibly muscle invasive disease.
Following his second course, his simple cystoscopy revealed a questionable lesion on the right wall of the bladder at the bladder neck, and magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed progression of disease.
The patient was then biopsied, and the repeat biopsy sent did reveal ongoing high-grade muscle invasive bladder carcinoma.
He was then removed from the bladder-sparing protocol and referred for radical surgery.
Above-noted bladder cancer.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] and taken to the operating room on [**2188-4-22**] where he underwent radical cystoprostatectomy and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection, multiple biopsies of his mesentery, as well as creation of an orthotopic ileal neobladder.
All of these were draining urine well with very minimal output initially from the Foley catheter and the suprapubic tube.
His pain continued to be controlled with a morphine patient-controlled analgesia.
He had very minimal mucous production.
The patient had a known deep venous thrombosis, but at this point the goal was to re-anticoagulate the patient once he was tolerating an oral diet with Coumadin and to leave his Lovenox at prophylactic doses.
On postoperative day two, the patient received some intravenous Toradol for pain control; however, his creatinine abruptly rose to 1.3, and the Toradol was discontinued after two doses.
By postoperative day five, the patient was no longer requiring pain medication.
The patient tolerated this quite well and had no difficulties.
