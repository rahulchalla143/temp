He was initially diagnosed with prostate CA in [**2132**] and has failed hormonal therapy now on cycle 12 of taxotere rec'd on [**2147-10-17**].
The patient states his back pain is lower back and has been worsening for the past 24 hours.
He has also had some subjective lower extremity weakness for the past [**4-12**] months without any change.
No fecal incontinence or urinary retention or incontinence.
No saddle anesthesia.
Over the past 3-4 days he also has noted a decrease in his urine output as well as a darkening of his urine.
He has been slightly confused from time to time only over the past few days and much more somnolent and with generalized weakness.
No other symptoms.
He was noted to have paroxysmal afib w/ RVR and rec'd 2x 15mg IV boluses of dilt and 30mg po dilt without much effect and then started on a dilt drip.
He also was noted to have a retrocardiac opacity so was given 250mg IV levofloxacin (given ARF cr 5.6).
He underwent a renal u/s which was negative for stone or hydronephrosis.

Low lung volumes.
[**2147-10-21**] Renal US: No hydronephrosis.
No evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
No findings to account for acute renal failure.
Left non- obstructing renal calculus/calculi.
Right pelvic wall mass and non-pathlogically enlarged right external iliac node have increased in size compared to 5 months prior.
Diffuse bony metastases redemonstrated, without acute fracture identified.
Small left greater than right pleural effusions are new, with associated atelectasis.
Progression of osseous metastases in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine.
No new compression fractures.
Unchanged small anterior epidural lesion at the level of L5, without evidence of definite nerve root involvement.
No evidence of new epidural lesions.
No cord compression.
Unchanged spondylosis as described above.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
No mass effect.
No non-contrast CT evidence for metastases.
MR is more sensitive in the detection of small masses and acute stroke.
LE U/S [**2147-10-26**] No evidence of DVT in the left lower extremity.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 yoM w/ a h/o metastatic prostate cancer and afib presents with worsening back pain, found to have thrombocytopenia and severe acute renal failure as well as afib with RVR- admitted to the ICU as he was requiring a diltiazem drip for rate control.
# Acute renal failure: Patient's ARF peaked at creatinine of 6.4, just barely made it without requiring dialysis.
[**Name2 (NI) 227**] thrombocytopenia, low haptoglobin, anemia, TTP/HUS and DIC remained on the differential, however smear was without evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia making these diagnoses less likely.
Hypotension leading to ischemic insult secondary to a fib in RVR is another possibility, however patient has had a fib for years making this also less likely.
# Anemia: Hct was slightly lower than baseline, as above labs were consistent with hemolysis but smears failed to show abundant schistocytes.
Baseline was in the low 30s and based on iron studies from [**5-18**] consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
# Afib with RVR: Patient's a fib in RVR was difficult to control with dilt in the ICU.
However, pt developed fatigue, increased depression, and bradycardia with high dose metoprolol concerning for beta blocker toxicity.
# Delerium: Pt developed delerium secondary to most likely a combination of mirtazapine and reglan use.
# Abdominal pain/nausea vomitting: KUB was negative, these symptoms resolved with BMs and were thought to be related to constipation.
# Back pain: Patient's back pain was associated with a few months of lower extremity weakness.
Last imaging of his spine was [**5-18**] with an MRI of his C, T and L spine which demonstrated diffuse metastasis to the spine and no cord compression.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for lower back pain and you were found to have a very high heart rate, kidney failure, and low platelet count.
We treated your kidney failure by aggressive IV hydration.
The cause of your kidney failure was unclear, however, it might have been related to your elevated heart rate leading to low blood flow to the kidneys.
