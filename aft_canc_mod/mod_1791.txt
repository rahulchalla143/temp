Admission Date:  [**2142-7-15**]       Discharge Date:  [**2142-8-9**]   Service:  OMED HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old woman with renal cell carcinoma, metastatic to the lungs, who presented to the Emergency Room with hemoptysis.
The patient denied any antecedent fevers, chills, cough, upper respiratory infection symptoms, sinus symptoms, nausea, history of hemoptysis.
Renal cell carcinoma diagnosed in [**2137**].
Abnormal mammogram in [**2140**].
The patient had focal atypical ductal hyperplasia and atypical lobular hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ, multiple foci.
Atypical chest pain.
In [**2140-5-19**], Persantine MIBI showed no electrocardiogram changes, no ejection fraction, no perfusion defects.
Venostasis ulcers by chart.
She has no children.
No sinus tenderness.
Erythema and slight swelling at the left corner of the mouth.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rhythm with no gallops.
Pulmonary: Poor air movement without localizing features.
No stridor or wheezes.
Extremities:  Bilateral lower extremity wrapped in Kerlix with skin changes consistent with chronic venous insufficiency.
Left facial droop with corner of the mouth turned slightly down, and eye lid did not elevate as much as the right.
CT angiogram on [**2142-7-15**], showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus, marked progression of bilateral infrahilar lung mass and subcarinal and bilateral hilar lobe lymphadenopathy.
There was resulting compression of the mainstem bronchi bilaterally and severe compression of the bronchus intermediate.
Head MRI showed large intracellular soft tissue mass lesion with suprasellar extension, invasion of the cavernous sinuses, superior displacement and compression of the optic chiasm and homogenous enhancement, most likely representing a large pituitary macroadenoma, possibility of meningioma, no mass affect on the brain parenchyma.
CT angiogram showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Marked compression of bilateral infrahilar lung masses and subcarinal bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy were seen with resultant compression of the mainstem bronchi bilaterally and severe compression of the bronchus intermediate.
The patient was transferred to the MICU and intubated for hypoxemia with hemoptysis.
The patient subsequently underwent bronchoscopy with stenting of the bronchus intermediate and left mainstem   bronchus with Argon coagulation of right lower lobe tumor.
Shortly after extubation, the patient became hypotensive with systolic blood pressure in the 90s associated with decreased urine output of an average of 40 cc/hr.
The patient subsequently became hypotensive again with decreasing oxygen saturation and increasing congestion with question of aspiration pneumonia versus postobstructive pneumonia.
The patient was started on intravenous Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Flagyl for suspected postobstructive pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonia.
On hospital day #8, the patient was not able to be weaned off Dopamine, and cortical stimulation test was sent which was positive suggesting adrenal insufficiency as the cause of hypotension.
The patient had an MRI of the brain which showed a large intracellular soft tissue mass lesion with suprasellar extension, invasion of the cavernous sinuses, superior displacement and compression of the optic chiasm, likely representing a large pituitary microadenoma versus meningioma.
On review of the MRI, the patient's panhypopituitarism was likely secondary to meningioma versus renal cell metastasis to the pituitary.
The patient was started on steroids for adrenal insufficiency, and the patient's Synthroid dose was increased for central secondary hypothyroidism.
The patient subsequently developed hypernatremia with sodium of 152.
The patient was started on DDAVP for presumed diagnosis of diabetes insipidus.
Oncology:  Neuro-Oncology was consulted regarding recommended treatment for brain mass noted on MRI.
Brain mass was likely a non-secreting pituitary adenoma versus renal cell carcinoma metastasis.
Recommended surgical removal if prognosis was greater than one year, as radiation induced retinopathy or cranial neuropathy would appear at one year.
As the patient's prognosis was poor and the patient was without visual symptoms at this time, they did recommend surgery.
The patient underwent video oropharyngeal swallow study which showed aspiration of thin liquids with spontaneous coughing.
Hyponatremia:  The patient developed hyponatremia with a sodium of 126.
It was uncertain if hyponatremia was from insufficient glucocorticoids or from her lung tumor.
Metastatic renal cell carcinoma to the lungs.
