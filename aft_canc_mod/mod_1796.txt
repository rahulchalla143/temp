CXR [**2119-8-13**]: No acute intrathoracic process.
CXR [**2119-8-14**]: There is interval development of right lung consolidation, mostly involving the right lower lobe, but also affecting the right upper lobe, extensive and given its rapid development might be consistent with interval aspiration.
CXR [**2119-8-16**]: There is interval improvement in the right basilar opacity which currently right perihilar lower lung abnormality demonstrated that might be consistent with resolution of massive aspiration giving complete absence of the abnormalities on [**8-13**], [**2119**], radiograph and its rapid development on [**2119-8-14**] radiograph.
Healed fractures of the left ribs are unchanged in appearance.
There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
There is no focal infiltrate.

Subcutaneous cystic lesion of the posterior left neck - ?
Non-contrast head CT showed no evidence of bleed.
CT C-spine showed no fracture or malalignment.
The patient's syncopal episode occurred in the setting of dizziness/vertigo.
Given the patient's known vertebrobasilar disease and the left carotid bruit observed on exam, the question of vertebrobasilar insufficiency was raised.
Differential diagnosis included Meniere's disease, vasovagal, orthostasis (in the setting of dehydration), or arrhythmia (in the setting of hyperkalemia).
The patient was monitored on telemetry, which initially showed bradycardia to 30s.
Followed correction of hyperkalemia, telemetry showed normal sinus rhythm with frequent premature ventricular contractions.
Echocardiogram showed preserved ejection fraction, with no evident structural cause of syncope.
Acute on chronic renal failure:  The patient presented with a creatinine of 2.4, up from baseline 1.1.
The etiology of the patient's acute on chronic renal failure was unclear.
Bradycardia:  In the ED, the patient had bradycardia to 30s, which improved with atropine and normalization of hyperkalemia.
Hypertensive emergency:  In the medical intensive care unit, the patient had flash pulmonary edema in the setting of agitation and hypertension to 220s/110s.
Metoprolol was added but then discontinued due to bradycardia.
Chest x-ray showed a right lower lobe infiltrate, although it was not clear if this was a true infiltrate or if it was pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertensive emergency.
The patient was treated empirically cefamine and vancomycin, which was subsequently narrowed to levofloxacin, for a 5-day course.
Further evaluation revealed microcytosis and severe iron deficiency (ferritin 5).
There was no evidence of hemolysis.
UPEP/SPEP did not show a monoclonal gammopathy.
He should follow up with his primary care provider for further evaluation of his iron deficiency anemia.
Diabetes mellitis: On admission, the patient's blood glucose was elevated to greater than 400.
Oral hypoglycemics were discontinued given acute renal failure, and the patient's blood sugar was managed with insulin.
He was was discharged on 9 of Lantus and a Humalog sliding scale (please see attached).
Schizoaffective disorder - The patient had some agitation, leading to hypertensive emergency.
Sebhorreic dermatitis: The patient had erythematous plaques, with greasy scaling, on his forehead, occiput, and beard area, consistent with seborrheic dermatitis.
