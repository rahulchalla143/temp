History of Present Illness: 75 yo lady with hx of severe COPD on home O2, non operable NSCL CA with nodule in LUL dx in [**2184**], s/p XRT, throid nodule, s/p flex bronch today with radioactive seed implantation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
CXR prior to procedure showed spiculated mass in the left upper lung field retracting the left hilum with volume loss in the LUL area and post procedure there was no evidence of pneumothorax.
There was no evidence of any pulmonary vascular congestion or any other pulmonary parenchymal densities.
Patient apparently returned home after procedure which was tolerated well, some hemoptysis post procedure.
Patient then "just didn't look well" as per family, developed increasing SOB and brought to ED by daughter.
Also started on Vancomycin and Unasyn to cover oral flora s/p bronch as well as post obstructive PNA given hx of lung CA.
CTA of chest was negative for PE but showed LLL consolidation suggestive of atelectasis with stable LUL mass but new opacities suggestive of aspiration vs. post obstructive PNA.
NSCL CA: non operable, no hx of chemotherapy as per family, s/p XRT, s/p radioactive seed implantation, initial bronch in [**2181**] was negative for malignancy, diagnosed in [**2184**] after mass identified on CXR, PET positive nodule, also positive thyroid nodule 2.
Severe COPD/Emphysema requiring intermittent home O2, last PFTs showing obstructive defect (FEV1/FVC 34) 3.

No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Interval development of a left lower lobe consolidation.
Patchy opacities are also visualized in the left lower lobe, which could represent aspiration pneumonia.
Stable appearance of left upper lobe mass.
Interval placement of metallic objects within the mass and in the adjacent areas.
CXR [**2187-7-31**]: Findings consistent within inoperable lung cancer in left upper lobe.
No evidence of pneumothorax following bronchoscopy.
Slightly increase interstitial densities at the lung bases, raising the possibility of CHF superimposed on COPD changes.
PET CT [**2187-7-2**]: Interval worsening in the region of a left upper lobe linear scar (post XRT): on [**2185-1-21**] soft tissue mass measured at 1.2 x 3.6cm with peak SUV 10.1, today 4 x 2.5cm & peak SUV 14.6.
There is interval worsening posteriorly with increased FDG-avidity and sclerosis of the posterior ribs.
These are consistent with tumor recurrence.
3) FDG-avidity in paratracheal region near right lower pole of thyroid (peak SUV 15.1)   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 yo lady w/ severe COPD, non operable lung CA s/p bronch with gold seed placement admitted with respiratory failure and septic shock.
Respiratory failure likely secondary to aspiration PNA vs. post obstructive PNA s/p bronch with gold seed placement, new opacities on CTA in LLL.
Also with elevated WBC count with left shift.
Diffusely wheezy on exam, likely [**12-20**] to severe underlying COPD.
Also question of LLL segmental bronchus obstruction from clot post procedure given history of hemoptysis and LLL atelectasis on CTA.
Patient treated with Unasyn for gram negative and anaerobic coverage and Vancomycin since patient has been in/out of hospital, instrumented, lives in retirement home, to complete a 14 day course of each.
The patient was also treated with steroids for COPD exacerbation with hydrocortisone and then Solu-Medrol with inhaled steroids.
Due to her severe COPD she required Albuterol Q2 hrs and Atrovent Q 6 hrs, 8-10 puffs each.
Sputum showed both gram positive cocci and gram positive rods.
CXR does not show any evidence of fluid overload.
but shows the stable LUL mass with severe underlying COPD.
She has been weaned several times to pressure support of [**3-22**] and even 0/5 but then becomes hypertensive, tachycardic, with increased secretions and dropping O2 sats.
Difficulty with extubation likely [**12-20**] severe underlying COPD and lung CA with element of increased anxiety initially.
Patient is off baseline sedation, anxiety well controlled with Seroquel and small doses of Ativan since patient was taking Ativan at home for anxiety (?).
Patient also developed some blood tinged sputum, either secondary to new process vs. underlying malignancy.
CXR showed questionable new LUL infiltrate on top of mass in that area, now resolved on CXR.
Her sputum grew out klebsiella and stenotrophomonas that were both sensitive to Bactrim.
# Septic Shock: Patient initially met criteria with elevated WBC, tachypnea with hypotension despite fluid resuscitation.
Empiric antibiotic coverage for post-obstructive PNA initiated with Unasyn and Vancomycin given recent bronchoscopy and high risk for mixed flora/anaerobes.
CVP was maintain between [**6-29**], MAP >65 and SvO2 >70 with continuous monitoring.
IV fluid boluses were continued with Lactated Ringers due to rising lactic acidosis.
Patient had a cortisol stim test which showed abnormal and paradoxical results but was ultimately started on steroids due to severe COPD.
She later became hypertensive and was diuresed due to the large amount of fluids she initially received for resuscitation.
She remained stable in terms of her likely pulmonary infection with her limitations being her dependence on the ventilator due to COPD and underlying lung CA.
# Metabolic Acidosis - Initially the patient had an anion gap of 17 with of ABG 7.15/52/329, lactate elevated to 6.0 ->2.2 after aggressive IVF.
Likely secondary to the underlying pulmonary infection.
# CE elevation: TnT highest at 0.26 with new TWI on telemetry/EKG.
Likely due to demand ischemia given severe hypotension with septic shock.
Patient was monitor on tele for new events throughout.
Beta blockers avoided given severe COPD.
# Hypertension- Patient with episodes of tachycardia and hypertension thought to be anxiety attacks with response to Ativan/Seroquel.
On [**8-10**] patient developed sustained hypertension after another episode of anxiety with SBP >230.
Patient had been off all antihypertensives until this point due to initial sepsis with hypotension.
Patient had been taking an ACE inhibitor at home, which was restarted, Captopril 6.25 mg titrated as necessary for elevated BP.
On [**8-16**], she has another episode of tachycardia to 110s and hypertension to 220s systolic in the setting of hypoxia secondary to being on a spontaneous breathing trial PS 0/5 for 45 minutes.
# Drop in Hct: Patient with a drop in Hct from 26 to 23 then 22 on [**8-9**], requiring 1 unit of pRBCs with an increase in Hct to 27.
Etiology unclear, possibly secondary in increased blood tinged sputum, also with one episode of hematuria.
# Hyperglycemia.
Patient does not have a known diagnosis of DM but did have glucose of >300 on admission, either secondary to a stress response vs. underlying DM.
Patient was having episodes of anxiety with hypertension, tachycardia, agitation with weaning of sedation/ventilation.
# Prophylaxis: Bowel regimen, Heparin SC + pneuma boots given history of CA, PPI, FS with insulin, ASA .
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Lorazepam 2 mg/mL Syringe Sig: 0.5-1 mg  Injection Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Sepsis from pneumonia Non-small cell lung cancer COPD Hypertension Anxiety   Discharge Condition: Stable.
She is able to tolerate spontaneous breathing trials for short periods.
Continue the weaning process from mechanical ventilation.
