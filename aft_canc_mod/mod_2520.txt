He experienced "heartburn" since 8:30 AM while at rest, described as mild epigastric discomfort, no radiation.
He was also diaphoretic with generalized weakness, unable to walk the bathroom.
He experienced no chest pain and there were no sig.
EKG showed ST elevations in leads I, AVL, V4-V6.
LCX had mild disease.
RCA had occluded PDA stent.
No stents were placed as there was consideration for CABG.
Patient is currently chest pain free.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
He has stable dyspnea on exertion and pedal edema.
Past Medical History: - COPD (on no inhalers) - HTN - dyslipidemia - CAD s/p LAD DES in [**2132**] for NSTEMI and midLAD and RPDA BMS in   [**3-/2138**] for STEMI.
- PVD s/p L fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass [**2131**], R fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass [**2132**] - COPD - HTN - Dyslipidemia - GERD   Social History: Social history is significant for prior tobacco use, h/o 40 pk year history, quit in [**2132**].
Pt drinks 2 beers per day and denies h/o withdrawal sxs.
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Mother had a MI at age 78.
Sclera anicteric.
CV: Pegular rhythm, tachycardic, normal S1, S2 with mechanical sounds.
Soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
Ext: 1+ pitting edema bilaterally.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated two vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD was occluded mid-portion at site of unstented angioplasty site with occluded distal stent.
The LCx had mild disease.
The RCA had a occluded PDA with stent occlusion.
Resting hemodynamic measurment demonstrated elevated filling pressures with a mean PCWP of 37 mmHG and mean RA of 19 mmHG.
Placement of an IABP for hemodynamic support in setting of cardiogenic shock.
Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca of the mid - distal left anterior descending.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the mid to distal anterior wall and anterior septum, dyskinesis of the apex and hypokinesis of all other mid and apical segments.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Severe regional LV systolic dysfunction in the distribution of the LAD.
Moderate hypokinesis of the mid inferior, inferolateral and apical segments.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-3-19**], the anterior septal and anterior wall akinesis and apical dyskinesis are new.

# CAD s/p STEMI: Cardiac catheterization demonstrated restenosis in one of the LAD stents and mechanistically placing another stent would obviate possible CABG.
A post catheterization ECHO showed a LVEF of 25% to 30% with moderate hypokinesis of the mid inferior, inferolateral and apical segments.
# Thrombocytosis: Platelet count on admission was 968 and this was felt to be reactive thrombocytosis to MI.
He was monitored for signs of withdrawal and did not demonstrate any symptoms which required intervention.
