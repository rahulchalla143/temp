Residual intramucosal adenocarcinoma with adjuvant therapy effect, arising in a background of Barrett's esophagus with dysplasia; see synoptic report.
Five lymph nodes with no carcinoma seen (0/5; majority of periesophageal and perigastric soft tissue is submitted for lymph node evaluation).
Level 7 lymph nodes, excisional biopsy (AF-AG):              Twelve lymph nodes with no carcinoma seen (0/12).
Gastric donut (AH):   Gastric corpus segment with prominent cautery effect and no carcinoma seen.
Esophageal donut (AI-AJ):   Squamous esophageal segment with no carcinoma seen.
V. Fundus, segmental resection (AK-[**Doctor Last Name **]):   Gastric corpus segment with mild chronic active gastritis and focal reactive changes, consistent with adjuvant therapy effect.
No carcinoma seen.
No evidence for pulmonary embolus.
Gastric pull-through with no evidence for intrathoracic abscess.
There is, however multiloculated regions of air identified along the oblique and horizontal fissures with a small less than 10% dependent pneumothorax identified on the right side.
Bilateral multifocal infiltrates within both lungs with compressive atelectasis noted at the lower lobes bilaterally.
[**2179-1-4**] CXR :Region of consolidation in the axillary left upper lobe which developed between [**1-2**] and [**1-3**] is still present as are larger regions of heterogeneous opacification in both lower lungs, all strongly suggestive of widespread pneumonia, particularly the findings in the left lung since esophagectomy typically entails considerable right basal atelectasis.
No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax  [**2179-1-5**] Ba swallow: No leak,some expected holdup at the pylorus but without obstruction.
His pain was initially controlled with an epidural catheter and he maintained stable hemodynamics.
His tube feedings were started on post op day #0 with replete and unfortunately he had some cloudy drainage from his JP drain by post op day 3 along with an elevated triglyceride level indicating a thoracic duct leak.
His pain got a bit worse and it was determined that the epidural was not functioning therefore it was replaced.
He did have some infiltrates on xray and therefore underwent vigorous pulmonary toilet including chest PT and incentive spirometry.
He was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn and gradually improved without any other episodes of desaturation or fevers.
His epidural was eventually removed and his pain was controlled with liquid oxycodone and Tylenol.
Following transfer to the Surgical floor he had a barium swallow done which confirmed no anastomotic leak and he subsequently began a liquid diet.
His dressing should be changed daily and prn as he has had a large amount of serous fluid draining from around the drain site.
On [**2179-1-7**] he developed several episodes of diarrhea and a stool for c difficile was sent which was negative.
His IV antibiotics were stopped  and he was treated with Imodium with some effect.
