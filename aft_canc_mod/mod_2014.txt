Patient reports that over the last several weeks, he has been feeling "lousy", reporting fatigue, loss of appetite and weakness.
However, he was extremely weak and could not stop having diarrhea and cancelled the colonoscopy.
Of note, patient had a generator change of his ICD on [**2162-7-14**], and has "not felt right" since.
Patient reports a 31lb weight loss over the past 4 months which was partly intentional, but he believes he "went overboard," losing more than intended.
He denies chest pain or palpitations recently, but does report shortness of breath.
He denies orthopnea or PND.
However, patient denies any melena or hematochezia.
In addition, he has not noted any changes in the caliber of his stool, and denies abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea.
He denies dysuria or hematuria.
He does report recent nocturia, urgency and occasional overflow incontinence.
In the ED, patient had two episodes of witnessed Vtach and was unresponsive and shocked by ICD.
12 lead EKG captured override pacing of monomorphic VT decompensating into ventricular fibrillation during the first episode.

1 PVC developing into ventricular fibrillation.
In light of lack of respiratory symptomology, this likely represents atelectasis, although an early developing focus of pneumonia or possibly aspiration cannot be excluded.
Again seen is a retrocardiac density which could represent atelectasis or pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.
Left pacemaker wires course through the brachiocephalic and terminate in right atrium and right ventricle.
Mild aortic tortuosity.
Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but unchanged without evidence of pulmonary edema.
No definite pleural effusion.
-Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**2162-10-8**]):  The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
LV systolic function appears moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to extensive apical akinesis, hypokinesis of the interventricular septum, and marked mechanical dyssynchrony (pacing vs left bundle branch block).
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility (the apical half of the right ventricular free wall is akinetic and aneurysmally dilated).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Gated images show severe apical perfusion defect extending into the distal anterior, septal, and inferior walls, as well as a moderate inferoseptal defect.
-Non-con Head CT ([**2162-10-15**]): No hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or evidence for acute vascular territorial infarction is present.
There is no shift of normally midline structures and [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation appears well preserved.
There is prominence of the ventricles and the sulci, compatible with age-related parenchymal involution.
No definite nidus of intra-abdominal infection identified.
Mesenteric ischemia cannot be excluded on this study.
Small left pleural effusion, small pericardial effusion, and generalized subcutaneous and mesenteric edema suggesting volume overload.
Coarse calcification of the left ventricular apex may represent prior infarction or calcified apical aneurysm.
No evidence of pneumonia.
Retrocardiac opacity seen in prior CXR likely corresponds to pleural effusion.
Cardiomegaly with extensive vascular calcifications as well as dense calcification of the left ventricle.
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy which may be reactive in this patient with chronic heart disease.
Emphysematous changes with bibasilar bronchial wall thickening, which could indicate chronic bronchitis.
Multiple pulmonary nodules measuring up to 4 mm.
-ECHO TTE ([**2162-10-16**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis/aneysm of the distal third of the ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.

Trace aortic regurgitation and mild mitral regurgitation were present on review of the prior study.
These images show expected biodistribution of radiotracer in the spleen and liver, with no focal areas of radiotracer identified to indicate a nidus for infection.
The above findings are consistent with no source for infection localized.
Lipoma in the distal ascending colon and proximal ascending colon.
-ENDOSCOPY [**2162-10-26**]: Impression: Erythema, congestion, friability and erosion in the antrum compatible with gastritis (biopsy).
Erythema and friability in the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 yo male with cardiomyopathy and h/o arrhythmia with ICD presenting with ventricular tachycardia/ fibrillation s/p 6 ICD firings.
# s/p VT with ICD firing- Patient has a history of ischemic vs mixed cardiomyopathy.
Patient presented with progressively worsening heart failure over the past several weeks.
During a prep for colonoscopy the patient reported feeling increasingly drowsy and weak with multiple episodes of loose stools.
While no exact etiology was found to explain the patient's ICD firing it was felt it may have been due to stress from high output bowel preparation.
# CHF- Patient has history of known systolic dysfunction with a depressed EF.
Echocardiogram performed during this admission showed EF of 30% with regional wall motion abnormalities, right ventricular failure and LV hypertrophy.
Patient was significantly volume overloaded at the time of admission and was diuresed.
Patient was evaluated for ongoing ischemia with a persantine stress test.
This showed  cardiac chamber enlargement and severe anteroapical and moderate inferoseptal perfusion defects.
Patient was unable to complete the study as he became acutely aggitated and the study canceled.
Patient was later noticed to be hypotensive and fluid responsive raising concern for over diuresis.
# Guiac Positive Stools-  Patient reports that he had positive stool guaiac with PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] denies melena or hematochezia.
He does have a history of diverticulitis s/p partial colectomy.
His coumadin was initially held in the setting of guaic positive stools.
He received an EGD and colonoscopy while inpatient which showed gastritis and duodenitis as well as diverticulosis.
Iron studies were sent as well which showed him to be iron deficient with an iron level of 8.
He was repleted with Ferric Gluconate 125 mg IV DAILY for severe iron deficiency.
His counts initially trended down, but early in the hospital course spiked to 23 associated with an acute change in mental status, though the patient was afebrile.
The exact etiology of his neutrophil predominant leukocytosis is unknown, but can classified without exception as non-infectious in etiology.
# Hypotension- The patient experienced several episodes of hypotension which were all fluid responsive.
We believe both of these episodes were related to over-diuresis as well as secondary to his blood pressure medications.
# H/o Atrial fibrillation- The patient is on amiodarone and metoprolol as noted above.
# Diabetes- The patient has a reported recent history of hypoglycemia and is thus not on any diabetes medications.
# Chronic kidney disease- Baseline creatinine appears to be ~1.4-1.5 and is 1.3 upon discharge.
# H/o gout- Continued on allopurinol.
# Transitional issues - pulm nodules 4mm on CT chest - needs f/u in 12 months - BCR-ABL test was pending at the time of transfer - H Pylori antibody and stain were pending at the time of transfer - patient will need lasix and lisinopril restarted as systolic pressures tolerate.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 6560**] Care & Rehab Center  - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Ventricular tachycardia s/p ICD firing Cardiomyopathy with systolic dysfunction Hypertension Atrial fibrillation Chronic kidney disease GI bleeding secondary to gastritis, duodenitis, and diverticulosis Leukocytosis of unclear etiology   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You were also noted to have an elevated white blood cell count.
We treated you with antibiotics for a possible pneumonia and performed numerous other blood tests and imaging, however we did not find any other source of infection.
You were noted to have blood in your stool.
We did an EGD (camera down the throat) and colonoscopy (camera into the large bowel) which revealed an ulcer, some irritation in your stomach and small bowel, and diverticulosis.
