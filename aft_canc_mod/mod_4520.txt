Seen at 7Feldberg outpatient clinic for count check yesterday; he complained of feeling very poorly and requested to come in early, gait was unstable & he used a wheelchair.
He states that since sleeping on his R shoulder on Sunday night, he has had [**8-4**] pain in the shoulder and difficulty moving it secondary to pain.
Today the patient reports that he was feeling extremely fatigued and so called an ambulance.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management and found to have T 103.3, tachycardia to 120s, and SBP 94.
Past Medical History: Oncologic History: His induction chemotherapy was complicated by acute kidney injury and neutropenic fever.
Induction with 3+7 was unsuccessful, so he was re-induced with MEC, which resulted in prolonged cytopenias and a brief ICU stay for respiratory difficulty.

Although differential considerations include the possibility of septic emboli, the appearance is not entirely typical, and atypical etiologies of infection including the possibility of aspergillosis should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.

# MSSA sepsis: Patient was initially admitted to BMT floor service and treated with vanco and cefepime with intermittent hypotensive which improved after 4L IVF and 1 unit PRBC.
Morning after admission, patient developed a new O2 requirement and was felt to be volume overloaded, and so received 30 mg IV lasix.
He then was febrile to 102 and was found to be hypotensive to SBP 70s that was unresponsive to 1L IVF.
Joint space aspiration revealed 2500 leukocytes concerning for a septic joint.
TTE was negative for valvular vegetations.
However, due to recurrent low grade fevers, he was placed on fluconazole.
CT's failed to reveal a distinct collection, though did show multifocal bilateral ground-glass opacities.
He continued to have low grade fevers which were attributed to a possibly septic joint/shoulder infection.
After the second drainage, patient was afebrile for the rest of his hospitalization and continued on nafcillin without event.
He underwent repeat chest CT when an CXR showed possible progression of the earlier opacities/nodules and this showed new predominantly peripheral nodules, a couple with cavitation, as well as increasing mixed consolidative and ground-glass opacity in the lingula concerning for septic emboli.
Patient underwent a repeat TTE to assess for valvular disease which was negative.
To Follow Up- - Patient will need repeat chest CT in [**12-28**] months to assess progression of nodules and ground glass opacities - urine histoplasma and galactomannan pending on discharge .
# Febrile neutropenia: Presented s/p 7+3 therapy and C1D17 from HIDAC.
Fevers were thought to be due to MSSA septicemia in conjunction with septic joint.
# R septic shoulder:  On presentation patient had extreme right shoulder pain.
Orthopedics was consulted and felt that his symptoms were secondary to a rotator cuff tear though septic joint was in the differential.
They tapped the shoulder- joint fluid showed 2500 leukocytes- elevated in the setting of leucopenia concerning for septic arthritis.
As the patient's neutropenia resolved his shoulder swelled up signficantly and pain worsened.
He underwent MRI of the shoulder which showed joint effusion, extensive subacromial/subdeltoid bursitis, extensive myositis of the shoulder girdle and a full thickness rotator cuff tear.
The patient underwent two subsequent taps, one by ortho (appx 2 ccs) [4500 WBC, 83% polys, no orgs on GS or culture] and the final by IR (appx 10cc), which showed 2+ polys and no organisms on gram stain or culture.
The patient became and remained afebrile after the third tap.
Narrow-complex Tachycardia: Patient had sporadic bouts of SVT while in the ICU, reaching rates of about 200 bpms.
BMT concerned of possible intracrdiac/valvular infection which may be affecting conduction system.
No signs of infectious collection seen on imaging.
Right calf nodule- Patient with small erythematous macule on lateral right calf which progressed to a non tender erythematous nodule.
Hypertension: Patient with history of hypertension on amlodipine at home.
This medication was discontinued on admission secondary to his low blood pressures in the setting of sepsis.
# Hyperbilirbuinemia:  Bilirubin slowly trending up from <1.0 to 2.7 on ICU day #4.
RUQ US did not show any cholangitic or hepatic process/obstruction.
6. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 1293**] - [**Location (un) 8957**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute myelogenous leukemia Methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia Right shoulder infection   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were found to have bacteria growing in your blood and required a stay in the intensive care unit.
The source of your infection was believed to be your shoulder- an MRI showed inflammation and tear of the muscles as well as fluid in the joints.
We made the following changes to your medications: - START taking nafcillin for your infection - START taking metoprolol for your heart rate and blood pressure - START taking fluconazole to prevent fungal infection - CHANGE your dose of acyclovir to 400 mg every eight hours - STOP taking amlodipine for your blood pressure  Followup Instructions: Please follow up at the appointments below:  Department: INFECTIOUS DISEASE When: MONDAY [**2158-11-27**] at 9:50 AM With: [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 457**] Building: LM [**Hospital Unit Name **] [**Hospital 1422**] Campus: WEST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name **] Garage  Department: HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY When: MONDAY [**2158-11-27**] at 2:00 PM With: [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 22**] Building: [**Hospital6 29**] [**Location (un) **] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage  Department: HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY When: MONDAY [**2158-11-27**] at 2:00 PM With: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 12633**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 22**] Building: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) 24**] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage                                [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **] MD [**MD Number(2) 3922**]  Completed by:[**2158-11-10**
