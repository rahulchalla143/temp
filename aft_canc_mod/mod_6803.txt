Please refer to the accompanying torso CT (clip #[**Clip Number (Radiology) 78462**]) for additional details.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture or subluxation.
Multilevel degenerative change.
Has CA and may have PE as cause of syncope.
INDICATION: 85-year-old male found down with forehead laceration.
The patient has history of cancer and there is concern for possible pulmonary embolism as cause of syncope.
CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: No filling defects are seen within the pulmonary arterial vasculature to indicate an underlying pulmonary embolus.

The lungs demonstrate moderate changes of centrilobular emphysema with upper lobe predominance.
A large spiculated mass is present in the right lung apex measuring approximately 6.0 x 2.2 cm concerning for underlying carcinoma.
A 1.0 cm pulmonary nodule is present in the right apex.
Nodular soft tissue is also seen adjacent to surgical chain sutures in the left upper lobe which could reflect tumor recurrence at a site of prior wedge resection (series 2A image 43).
There is moderate nodular ground-glass opacity in the lingula and at the left base representing an inflammatory or infectious etiology such as aspiration.
There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There are multiple subcentimeter hypodensities throughout the liver parenchyma, which are too small to characterize.
There is no evidence for gallbladder wall edema or pericholecystic fluid to indicate acute cholecystitis.
A low attenuation 3 cm lesion in the upper pole of the right kidney is compatible with a cyst.
A 1-cm and 1.5 cm cystic lesion in the mid right and lower left kidney respectively do not meet CT criteria for a simple cyst and are incompletely characterized.
There is no free intraperitoneal fluid or air.
Small mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes not not meet criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Atherosclerotic plaque is seen throughout the aorta.
A large amount of stool is present throughout the rectum and sigmoid colon.

There are moderate degenerative changes throughout the thoracic and lower lumbar spine.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus, aortic dissection or traumatic injury within the chest, abdomen and pelvis.

Nodular ground-glass opacity in the lingula and left lower lobe, which could reflect an evolving infectious inflammatory process or aspiration.

Cholelithiasis without evidence for acute cholecystitis.
Destructive lytic lesion in the right femoral greater trochanter and left iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] concerning for osseous metastases.
Bone scan could be performed if indicated to assess for additional foci of osseous metastasis.
No prior sinus imaging studies are available for comparison.
FINDINGS: Again identified is an air-fluid level in the left maxillary sinus with air-fluid levels in the sphenoid sinuses bilaterally.
The ethmoid air cells are partially opacified, and there is minimal mucosal thickening or fluid in the frontal sinus.
No other osseous abnormalities are identified.
There are [**Last Name (un) 36826**] type II fovea ethmoidalis bilaterally.
CONCLUSION: Partial opacification of the paranasal sinuses as described above with an air-fluid level in the left maxillary sinus and in the sphenoid sinuses.
