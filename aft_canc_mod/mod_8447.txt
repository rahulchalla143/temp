Abnormal perfusion of the left kidney with areas of decreased enhancement within the cortex.
These findings are worrisome for an acute pyelonephritis.
Low attenuating lesion within segment II of the liver, indeterminate in etiology, this may represent an atypical hemangioma.
Enlarged uterus with multiple fibroids.
There is also enlargement of the right ovary.
Liver ultrasound; IMPRESSION: Nonspecific subcentimeter hypoechoic lesion within the left hepatic lobe, corresponding to CT abnormality.
Findings not characterizable as hemangioma and MR may be performed to further assess as clinically indicated.
Urine culture; yeast   Brief Hospital Course: 45 year old woman with history of seizure disorder (complex partial seizures and occasional GTC) who was transferred from CHB after a seizure cluster (30 mins) in setting of 38.9C, WBC of 20K.
After extubation, patient appeared encephalopathic, with impaired attention, intrusion saccades and lateral gaze nystagmus without focal features.
It was felt that worsening of her seizure frequency was most likely due to either an infectious process, medication non-adherence or non-epileptic seizures (an event was witnessed while in ICU: report of a gaseous odor, staring for 10 seconds, bilateral arm shaking that was suppressible by examiner (total duration of 30 seconds) and no post-ictal confusion).
She had an episode [**12-21**] in which she vomited and then became unresponsive with tonic posturing, eyes open and midline with occasional frequent blinking, and was unresponsive to noxious stimuli.
The episode lasted approximately five minutes and resolved after 1 mg ativan.
She had no further episodes and neurological examination at time of discharge was nonfocal with fluent speech, EOMI with no nystagmus, and steady gait.
She had a history of chills and malaise 2 days prior to her event.
UA was contaminated and repeat UA showed mild leukocyte count with elevated RBCs, which were treated as a UTI with ceftriaxone started.
A CT abdomen/pelvis was concerning for acute pyleonephritis and she was continued on a 7-day antibiotic course for this.
Her leukocytosis has trended down and has been afebrile for the past 4 days prior to discharge.
CXR did not show evidence of PNA.
GI: Patient was complaining LLQ pain x 1 week, which was attributed to pyleonepritis as above and had resolved with antibiotic treatment.
Also, on CT abd/pelvis, a subcentimeter liver lesion was noted and ultrasound was performed for further evaluation which was also non-diagnostic.
F/E/N: During the hospitalization there was also some concern by the primary team of weight loss since her last admission and anorexia, and it is advised that the patient continued to be evaluated for this by her PCP.
