Physical Exam: VS: T: 98.2    HR: 106 SR    BP: 160/80    Sats: 96% RA General: 46 year-old female in no apparent distress HEENT: normocephalic, mucus membranes moist Neck: supple, no lymphadenopathy Card: RRR good click, normal S1,S2 no murmur/gallop/rub Resp: decreased breath sounds bilateral GI: benign Extr: warm no edema Incision: well healed, pigtail site no discharge Neuro: non-focal   Pertinent Results: [**2129-8-19**] Chest CT: IMPRESSION: 1.
Marked improvement of diffuse airspace consolidation and opacity in the right lung, consistent with resolving hemorrhage.
Unchanged appearance of left-sided pigtail catheter; little decrease in small left pleural collection, probably hemorrhagic.
Improving left lower lobe hematoma.
[**8-11**] CTA chest/ abd/ pelvis: There is no evidence of any active bleeding or extravasation of contrast into the pleural space or into the abdomen.
Minimal free fluid in the abdomen is of a simple fluid attenuation and is not blood.
[**8-8**] Ct: Worsening of diffuse airspace opacities in the right lung from  [**2129-7-31**].
These may represent worsening multifocal pneumonia.
However, superimposed edema or hemorrhage can't be excluded.
Left lower lobe nodular opacities similar in appearance from prior study.
Left loculated pleural effusion is smaller with pigtail catheter centered in the effusion.
Assessment for empyema limited without IV contrast.
CXR [**8-20**] The right lung base shows a  peribronchial area of consolidation that is likely to represent pneumonia.
In the retrocardiac lung areas, sparse air bronchograms and a subtle pleural effusion is seen.
No hilar or mediastinal enlargement.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
CXR [**8-8**]:  B/l diffuse airspace opacities which may reflect worsed multifocal pna; superimposed pulm edema/hmg cant be ruled out/ no effussions.
These may represent worsening multifocal pneumonia.However, superimposed edema or hemorrhage can't be excluded.
Left lower lobe nodular opacities similar in appearance from prior study.
Left loculated pleural effusion is smaller with pigtail catheter centered in the effusion.

Patient was admitted to MICU for increased oxygen requirements and respiratory distress following bronchoscopy.
On bronchosopy, it appeared that pulmonary bleed was diffuse.
Etiology of hemopysis was thought to be secondary to multifocal pneumonia on top of radiation changes to lung in setting of anticoagulation.
WIth treatment of PNA and holding anticoagulation, hemoptysis resolved.
A rheuamtology work up for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage was pursued, but was pending at time of discharge from MICU.
Patient had hemoptysis that resolved during hospital stay in setting of anticoagulation for mechanical valve.
She remained anemic during MICU course requiring 7 units of PRBCs.
She was guiaic negative and CT torso did not show any ongoing bleeding or hematoma.
Her lovenox was held and her bleeding resolved.
Patient had rising LFTs after episode of prolonged hypotension following intubation.
Thought to be due to shock liver, but was evaluated for hepatitis as well.
Infectious Disease:  Sputum cultlures positive for serratia marscesens.
Pleural fluid positive E. coli (sensitive to cefepime) and MRSA.
Hematologic/Oncologic: seen on [**2129-8-15**] for hemoptysis and felt hemoptysis is related to infection and is resolving as infection is treated.
