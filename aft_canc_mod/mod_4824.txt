Pt admitted intially on [**8-27**] for shortness of breath, AMS, confusion, lethargy x 48hrs thought to be hepatic encephalopathy, given elevated ammonia, treated with Lactulose.
On [**8-30**], pt developed respiratory distress and hypoxemia, was intubated and treated for ARDS.
Considered etiologies remained hepatic encephalopathy with ongoing treatment with Lactulose and Rifaximin and good stooling response, as well as slowed clearance of sedating medications used while intubated given obesity.
Pt continued to have daily spontaneous breathing trials which she passed easily but given mental status was maintained on minimal ventilator support and was trached on [**9-17**] with Shiley trach.
Pt repeatedly sedated with propofol and ativan drip given agitation and fighting of vent.
Course also complicated by recurrent fevers to 101-102.
No evidence of ascites on US or abd scans.
Other issues have been persistent thrombocytopenia (60s-120s), coagulopathy (INR 1.5-1.7, no bleeding).

Chest CT [**9-13**]:  Mild cardiomegally, trace bilateral pleural effusions, bilateral dependent lower lobe consolidation or atelectasis, diffuse ground glass appearance c/w interstitial pneumonitis or ARDS.
Extensive perivascular anterior mediastinal nodes stable.
Abd CT: Small ascites, nodular liver, BIIIIG spleen, s/p PCBD, no LAD, stones, masses .
ECHO [**9-13**]: EF 60%, mild LVH, mild MR .
CXR [**9-20**]: Rotated to the right, bibasilar consolidation vs fluid overload.
2) Soft tissue thickening anterior to the anterior surface of the liver which could represent omental metastases in light of history of colon carcinoma as suggested by OMR note, although the PET scan was reported as negative.
3) Mild splenomegaly.
4) No source of sepsis identified.
No acute intracranial process.
Paranasal sinus minor inflammatory disease, and partial fluid- opacification of the mastoid air cells, some of which may relate to intubation.
No evidence of omental mass or thickening in the upper abdomen (note that the pelvis was not imaged) 3.
Bibasilar pulmonary consolidations.
Considerations include atelectasis and/or infection and these must be placed in clinical context.
[**2145-9-22**] Spinal fluid Cerebrospinal fluid (LP):    NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
No evidence of intracranial mass or abnormal enhancement.
Diffuse thickening of the calvarium with decrease dsignal- nonspeciifc finding and can be seen with anemia, myeloproliferative or infiltrative malignancies/disorders- to correlate with labs.
Diffuse mucosal thickening/ fluid within bilateral mastoid air cells.
[**2145-9-24**] EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG study due to slowing and disorganization of the background activity.
These findings suggest a moderate encephalopathy involving cortical and subcortical structures.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing although encephalopathies can obscure focal findings.
No epileptiform features were noted during this recording.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the pulmonic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No obvious vegetation  [**2145-9-29**] RUQ u/s IMPRESSION: Small amount of pericholecystic fluid.
Pt arrived to MICU from OSH with altered mental status likely from a combination of medication overload in the setting of liver dysfunction and hepatic encephalopathy.
Lactulose and rifaximin where continued, sedation was decreased and mental status began to improve with some clearing and purposeful movements but unable to follow commands.
Moderate encephalopathy on EEG.
Cirrhosis with etiology likely combination of chemotherapy induced and fatty liver, also with component of active liver inflammation and rising bilirubin.
Viral studies negative or pending.
Followed by the liver sevice and not a transplant canditated given h/o metastatic colon cancer history w/ < 5 yrs from colectomy and diagnosis.
Thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy stable since arrival and thought likely secondary to underlying cirrhosis.
Has had daily dressing changes and a flexiseal for stool.
Initially with an elevated creatinine and hematuria.
Creatinine improved and hematuria resolved.
Also with hypernatermia likely from volume resucitation and inability to take po, Sodium improved with free water and is now normal.
Quetiapine 25 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: 0.5 Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for agitation.
Respiratory Failure 4.
Thrombocytopenia 5.
Acute Renal Failure 6.
You were evaluated by the liver doctors and it was determined that you are currently not a candidate for a liver transplant because you had cancer within the past five years.
The reason that you have liver failure is not entirely clear at this time, but is thought to be related to the chemotherapy you received for the cancer as well as to fat build up in your liver.
