Patient initially presented to BIDN on [**9-21**] with several days worth of worsening SOB, CXR showed lower lobe consolidation, and she was started on levofloxacin as well as steroids and nebulizers for COPD.
She then started to have continued runs of AFib with RVr into the 120s, with subseuqent jaw pain (her anginal equivalent), and anterior ST depressions.
The jaw pain would resolve with SL Nitro, then return intermittently and she was thus started on a nitro gtt, as well as a dilt gtt for rate control.
Also of note, her Hct had decreased from 28 to 22 with no obvious bleeding source, INR 3.5.
The patient has a history of CAD s/p MI, PTCA and CABG in '[**17**].
Pt's anginal equivalent is jaw pain; pMIBI in [**2139**] showed reversible moderate in severity ischemic defect in the distal anterior wall and apex.
Hypokinesis of the distal anterior wall and apex.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
NECK: Supple, JVP to edge of mandible CARDIAC: irregular rhythm, S1, S2, no murmurs/rubs/gallops appreciated LUNGS: crackles throughout lower [**11-26**] of lung fields bilaterally, some improvement with coughing ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended, +BS rectal: guaic negative, brown stool in the rectal vault EXTREMITIES: warm, well-perfused, 2+ DP pulses, some bruising on UE b/l, no bruising of thighs/back SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

MODERATE GROWTH.
Since [**2142-9-22**], bilateral lower lung opacities have worsened concerning for an aspiration.
Minimal left pleural effusion is unchanged.
Atherosclerotic calcifications seen at the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.
IMPRESSION: Since [**2142-9-22**], new bilateral lower lung opacities are concerning for aspiration and mild left pleural effusion is unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 75F PMHx Afib on coumadin chronic CHF (EF >55%), CAD s/p CABG, severe COPD on 3L home O2, stage 1A squamous cell lung ca who presented with aFib with RVR in the setting of a pnuemonia and COPD exacerbation, now rate controlled and treated, being discharged to rehab.
ACTIVE ISSUES: #Atrial Fibrillation:  Transfered from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with Afib with RVR and jaw pain thought to be from rate related ischemia.
She was rate controlled with IV agents, with resolution of her jaw pain.
#Pneumonia: Patient w bilateral lower lung opacities in setting of increased O2 requirement and leukocytosis.
# COPD Exacerbation:  O2 requirment up to 4L on admission from baseline 3L; she was given IV steroids, ipratropium nebulizers and treatment of PNA as above; later switched to PO prednisone with the plan for slow taper given severe underlying lung disease; at discharge, plan to receive one more day of 40mg po prednisone followed by 5 days of 20 mg po prednisone then stop.
Albuterol was avoided as she has a history of tachycardia following albuterol use.
# Chronic Diastolic CHF / Volume overload:  Pt received 2U PRBC at OSH and was volume overloaded which may have been contributing to her SOB.
# CAD:  Has h/o CABG and multiple PCIs.
Has known reversible ischemia from stress on 4/[**2139**].
Jaw pain most likely from rate related demand ischemia versus ACS.
Jaw pain resolved with rate control.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # PAD: Severe PVD s/p femoral stenting b/l renal artery stenosis s/p right stent placed [**11-28**].
# Barrets esophagus/GERD: Continued omeprazole 20mg daily.
# Lung cancer: s/p LLL wedge resection for stage IA SCC lung [**2-/2141**] with several small pulmonary nodules that continue to warrant follow-up.
Transitional Issues: # Started lisinopril: She will need monitoring of her renal function and potassium for a short time.
11. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for anxiety.
16. polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1) PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - [**Location (un) 550**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Pneumonia COPD exacerbation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Your pneumonia has been treated with antibiotics but you will need to continue this medication (BACTRIM DS) three times a day for 14 days.
