1)BRBPR- He was initially admitted to the ICU due to concern for brisk GI bleed given syncope.
He was evaluated by GI service who felt that bleeding was most likely due to irritation and proctitis in the setting of recent chemotherapy in combination with ASA/PLAVIX/NSAID use making him more susceptible to bleeding.
He did not have colonoscopy or endoscopy during admission given that he had a troponin leak vs old NSTEMI and was felt to be at high risk for the procedure and his HCT was stable with no significant bleeding during his admission.
2)Syncope: most likely related to orthostasis/hypovolemia in the setting of recent chemotherapy and poor oral intake.
GI bleed also possible but less likely to be the cause of his syncope as HCT was relatively stable and >30.
3) Back/leg pain: Most likely due to metastatic disease to the spine.
Evidence of foraminal narrowing which per report could cause L4 irritation.
Pain well controlled on morphine on admission.
4)Chronic systolic heart failure/CAD: He has significant h/o MI and cardiac disease with troponin elevation on admission which could be old NSTEMI vs. demand ischemia in setting of volume depletion and syncope given poor po intake.
His Imdur and his HCTZ/spironolactone were held given that he has been having poor po intake and was somewhat dehydrated.
5) Acute on Chronic kidney disease - He had acute renal failure on admission likely due to poor po intake since recent chemo, which resolved with IVF and was better than baseline CR of ~1.3 by the time of discharge.
6)Metastatic prostate ca: s/p dose of Taxotere about 1 week ago, now with WBC trending down.
Recent ANC -> GRAN 1040.
7)Left 2nd Toe pain - He was evaluated by podiatry for left second toe pain and slight erythema.
He had xray with no evidence of fracture or osteomyelitis.
Pain improved prior to discharge and no evidence of infection.

-Chronic Systolic CHF EF 35% ([**8-/2133**]) -Chronic Renal Insufficiency, Baseline Cr 1.5-1.6 -HTN - x 20 years, pt reports excellent BP control at home -Gout -P-Afib/Aflutter (ablation [**2132-1-10**]) -Glaucoma -blind in Right eye -Depression/anxiety   Discharge Condition: fair   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after you fainted and had blood in your stool.
Your rectal bleeding is most likely due to inflammation of the lower part of your colon and rectum associated with your chemotherapy.
You continued to have evidence of bleeding in your stool but your blood count was stable and you did not require any additional transfusions.
There was no evidence of fracture or infection of the bone.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you experience any concerning symptoms including increased blood in your stool, light headedness, fainting, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, inability to eat and drink, fever or any other concerning symptoms.
