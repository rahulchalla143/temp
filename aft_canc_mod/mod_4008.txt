HPI: 65 yo man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma metastatic to abdomen and retroperitonium with a complicated history of biliary obstruction from tumor compression who is transfered to OMED from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
He was seen in clinic yesterday for a regular follow up visit and was found to be jaundiced with an elevated AP and total bilirubin.
He was evaluated in clinic and noted to have hypotension to 97/55 and fever to 101.4.
He denies fevers, chills, chest pain, SOB, dizziness, increasing LE edema, bloody/black tarry stools, or any other concerning symptoms.
He also describes short, fleeting episodes of abdominal pain that lasts for [**1-20**] the day and then goes away on its own.
Of note, his most recent hospital stay was complicated by anemia with episodic need of blood transfusion.
He has a history of two recent admissions ([**Date range (1) 62721**] and [**Date range (1) 62722**]) to the ED and ICU for cholangitis and biliary obstruction s/p ERCP with plastic and then metal stent placement.
Past Onc Hx: Mr. [**Known lastname 7710**] presented in [**2176-10-19**] with urinary retention, ultrasound revealing a mass in the right kidney, surgery was delayed, but he underwent right nephrectomy on [**2177-3-14**], revealing a 10-cm tumor clear cell pathology, [**Last Name (un) 9951**] grade 3 to 4, with tumor extension into the perinephric issues.
However, at the time of diagnosis, there was no evidence of distant metastatic disease.
The patient was enrolled in the ARISER clinical trial randomized phase III double blind adjuvant study involving cG250 versus placebo, received twelve weeks of therapy, at which point, a CAT scan demonstrating increased retroperitoneal lymph nodes suggestive of metastatic disease.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization with stent placement for symptoms of angina on [**2177-7-30**], to the RCA.
Followup CT in mid [**Month (only) 216**] revealed slight increase in size of retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and since then the patient has intermittent history of abdominal pain, which has become progressive in nature.
He received 11 out of 14 doses and was stopped secondary to neurotoxicity.
His last treatment was delayed in the setting of the elevated creatinine and urinary retention on [**2178-1-5**].
He had been on Sutent [**Date range (1) 62717**] when it was stopped for BRBPR.
He was admitted [**5-27**] and [**7-8**] for cholangitis with CBD obstruction despite stent placement due to large met compressing cbd.
Past Medical History: 1)Metastatic renal cell ca with known large mesenteric metastasis, and liver mets on Sutent as below, complicated course with biliary obstruction from tumor s/p stent placement [**5-25**] in CBD.
2)CAD s/p RCA [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5175**] [**7-/2177**]: Cath [**7-24**]: LCX 75% stenosis, OM1 50% stenosis, RCA 90% stenosis 3)Diabetes 4)GERD 5)HTN 6)Hypothyroid 7)Hyperlipidemia 8)BPH retention - indwelling foley with failed voiding trial- no turp due to hematuria.
Urologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**] 9) s/p appendectomy 10) s/p tonsillectomy 11) Extensive DVT up into the IVC to the level of compression of the abdominal mass > an IVC filter was discussed however was not deemed possible given the location of the compressive mass 12) CKD: baseline 1.4-1.6 13) GI bleed   Social History: Lives with wife in [**Name (NI) 7658**], MA.
HEENT: sclera icteric, dry MM, CV: RRR, no murmurs, rubs, gallps Chest: limited exam due to patient's inability to sit up, though CTAB, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi appreciated Abd: abdomen mildly distended, +BS, no guarding or rebound, mildly tender to deep palpation over left side of abdomen Ext: [**2-21**]+ pitting edema in BLE Neuro: CN 2-12 grossly intact   Pertinent Results: Imaging: ERCP [**2178-7-30**]: Tumor infiltration in the duodenum.
Biliary stricture compatible with malignant biliary stricture from tumor infiltration above previously placed stent - a second covered wall stent was placed.
Gallbladder US [**2178-7-29**]:  The common bile duct was not visualized due to overlying bowel gas, however, no evidence of intrahepatic bilary ductal dilatation was noted.
No evidence of cholecystitis is identified.
CT chest/abd/pelvis [**2178-7-8**]: Increased intrahepatic biliary dilatation without intrabiliary gas suggests occlusion of the common bile duct stent.
Stable disease burden with unchanged large retroperitoneal mass and mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
Unchanged IVC thrombosis with extension into the bilateral iliac veins as well as thrombosis of the proximal SVC.
Unchanged appearance of the L2 lytic lesion with focal compression.
Unchanged 3 mm left lower lobe nodule.
Mild ascites and anasarca.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 7710**] is a 65 yo male with metastatic renal cell cancer who present with biliary obstruction.
During the admission, he developed a rise in his pancreatic enzymes with no clear source, as it was several days after instrumentation.
In addition, he developed worsening guaiac positive diarrhea, with no ability to absorb; antibiotics were started.
