She was in her usual state of health until Saturday evening when she developed acute numbness to her Right leg, as well as significant weakness from the knee down.
This time, it was also accompanied by weakness and paresthesias in her right arm.
The numbness in her leg was accompanied by excruciating pain, and she was unable to bend it as it became very stiff.
This prompted her to go to the ER where a head CT demonstrated a 2.7cm parafalcine meningioma with surrounding vasogenic edema and focal mass effect.
An MRI then showed a large extra-axial mass abutting and inseparable from the falx cerebri with mass effect on adjacent parietal lobe with white matter edema.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
34-mm left parafalcine heterogeneously enhancing meningioma, with mild surrounding edema and minimal overall mass effect.
No evidence of acute hemorrhage.
MRI Brain [**2117-10-8**] (Post-Op): IMPRESSION: Status post resection of left posterior frontal rim-enhancing lesion seen on the previous MRI.
Expected post-surgical changes are seen with a small area of residual enhancement.
Spine MRI (C-, T-, and L-spine) [**2117-10-13**]: No spinal lesions seen.
Multilevel degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine with canal and foraminal narrowing without frank cord compression or abnormal cord signal.
This is associated with severe canal narrowing and moderate intrathecal crowding  Brain MRI [**2117-10-13**]: Post-op changes.
Left frontoparietal edema.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2117-10-6**] for right sided plegia and was urgently taken to the OR for tumor resection.
Post-operative MRI revealed no evidence of new CVA.
On [**10-8**] an EEG was performed to rule out seizures secondary to concerns of "twitching"- no seizure activity was documented on EEG.
There was no suggestion of a newCVA.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Hydromorphone 2 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for moderate pain.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
