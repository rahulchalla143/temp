Not Finalized  [**4-2**] NCHCT  No change compared to study on [**2138-3-31**].
[**3-31**] LENIS No evidence of right or left lower extremity DVT.
NCHCT [**3-31**]  Little change in appearance of suprasellar mass with associated  mild hydrocephalus, details as above.
No significant change in size of the ventricles with residual mild hydrocephalus.
No evidence of new hemorrhage.
[**2138-3-26**]   Radiology MR PITUITARY W&W/O CONT FINDINGS: Again noted is the large, heterogeneously enhancing sellar mass extending to the suprasellar region.
The cystic component in the right superior-most portion of the mass is also unchanged.
The lesion currently measures 3.6 (TRV) x 3.1 (AP) x 5.6 cm (CC) [10:12; 6:9], unchanged in size allowing for differences in imaging modality and plane of scanning.
The inferior portion of the lesion demonstrates small scattered air pockets.
A new relatively non-enhancing region at the base, extending into the center of the lesion measures approximately 3.0 x 1.5 (TRV) x 1.3 (AP) x 3.0 cm (CC), likely represents the expected post-biopsy defect.
There is packing material in the nasal passage, with a small amount of blood.
Moderate mucosal thickening is noted in the maxillary, ethmoid and frontal sinuses.
There is interval decrease of the ventriculomegaly, bilaterally.
Persistent mild periventricular T2/FLAIR hyperintensity represents transependymal CSF migration secondary to the obstructive hydrocephalus.
No evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage.
Packing material in the left sphenoid air cell and the nasal cavity.
Right transfrontal ventriculostomy catheter in place, with slight short-interval improvement in the degree of obstructive hydrocephalus, and persistent periventricular rim of T2-/FLAIR-hyperintensity, representing transependymal migration of CSF.
[**2138-3-25**] CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRA FINDINGS: The 3.4 x 3.2 cm pituitary mass is unchanged in appearance from the prior CT and MRI.
There is no evidence of intraventricular hemorrhage or hydrocephalus.
There is no evidence of new hemorrhage.
There is mucosal thickening in the bilateral maxillary sinuses, some with a polypoid appearance.
The sphenoid sinus septum attaches midline both anteriorly and posteriorly.
Unchanged appearance of large pituitary mass with suprasellar extension which is in close proximity to the bilateral anterior cerebral arteries, bilateral supraclinoid segments of the intracarotid arteries, and basilar artery and P1 segments of the posterior cerebral arteries.
No evidence of new hemorrhage.
[**2138-3-25**] CT SINUS W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: A 3.8 x 3.4 cm sellar and suprasellar mass does not appear significantly changed from the prior MRI and CT examinations.
There is mild mucosal sinus disease.
There appear to be bilateral sphenoethmoidal air cells (Onodi).
On the right the onodi cell contains a small mucosal retention cyst.
There is opacification of scattered left posterior ethmoid air cells.
The sphenoid sinus septum is essentially midline.
The cribriform plate, ethmoid roofs and laminae papyracea appear intact.
A left sided osseous bar of the sphenoid inserts on the left carotid groove.
There is mild circumferential mucosal thickening of the left maxillary sinus as well as two small mucosal retention cysts within the right maxillary sinus.
The ostiomeatal units are patent, though there is mucosal thickening along the infundibulum on the left.
No significant interval change in appearance of known sellar and suprasellar mass.
Mild scattered mucosal thickening.
Bilateral Onodi air cells.
Large sellar/suprasellar mass with areas of abnormal susceptibility which on correlating with the recent CT appear to represent hemorrhagic changes.
Findings likely represent pituitary macroadenoma with hemorrhagic changes.
The mass is indenting the third ventricle causing dilatation of bilateral lateral ventricles.
[**2138-3-24**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 20 yo M with 1 week headache/ nausea, found to have large suprasellar hemorrhagic mass.
Patient was admitted to the Neurosurgical Intensive care unit for observation and placement of an EVD for obstructive hydrocephalus.
He was extubated the following day on [**3-27**] and follow up imaging showed that his ventricles had reduced in size.
No bleeding noted afterwards.
On visual field testing he had an obvious left peripheral field cut.
This was harder to assess on the right side secondary to his right gaze nystagmus and slight right gaze preference.
He was sent to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] for computerized ophthomology evaluation that was consistent with dense bitemporal hemianopsia.
