However, the extent of vasogenic edema associated with the mass has increased.
There is also a slight interval increase in leftward mildline shift from 7 to 9 mm.
Partial compression of the right lateral and third ventricles is again seen.
The temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle may have increased in size since [**2175-9-22**].
The known right thalamic mass is poorly visualized, as it demonstrates only minimal hyperdensity.
Edema in the right deep white matter, thalamus, midbrain and pons is not significantly changed since [**9-22**] allowing for differences in modalities.
A right frontal burr hole is again seen.
Increased vasogenic edema associated with known right frontal mass is increased since [**2175-9-22**].
Slightly increased leftward midline shift.
Persistent partial compression of the third and right lateral  ventricles.
Right thalamic mass is poorly seen.
Associated mass effect is grossly stable.
MR HEAD W/CNTRST [**2175-10-10**] FINDINGS: Right frontal lobe mass is identified with surrounding edema as on the previous MRI of [**2175-9-22**].
Additional enhancing lesion is seen in the right basal ganglia with surrounding edema.
Enhancing masses in the right frontal lobe and right thalamic regions are seen as before.
Mass effect is seen on the right lateral ventricle.
MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST [**2175-10-12**] FINDINGS: There is a large heterogeneously enhancing mass in the right frontal lobe which measures 3.8 x 3 cm.
There is a second right thalamic mass which measures 1.6 x 1.7 cm.
There is associated perilesional edema causing 1-cm leftward subfalcine herniation.
There are no other areas of abnormal enhancement.
There is also hypoattenuation extending into the right pons which does not demonstrate enhancement and could reflect extension of the edema from the thalamic lesion.
IMPRESSION: Heterogeneously enhancing right frontal and thalamic lesion with perilesional edema and leftward subfalcine herniation in the setting of known malignancy suspicious for metastases.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2175-10-13**] FINDINGS: There has been interval resection of the right frontal mass with postoperative pneumocephalus and small amount of cortical hyperattenuation which could reflect minimal postoperative blood products.
There is persistent vasogenic edema spanning the right frontoparietal convexity and extending into the right thalamic, mid brain, and anterior temporal regions, the extent of edema is minimally larger than the prior study and may relate to recent intervention.
There is minimal mass effect causing 6-mm leftward deviation of the septum pellucidum, unchanged since the prior study.
Expected post surgical changes following resection of the right frontal mass with postoperative pneumocephalus and minimal resection bed blood products.
Persistent mass effect with 6-mm leftward deviation of the septum pellucidum.
Right thalamic edema, likely reflects known underlying thalamic lesion.
Blood products are seen in this region with small amount of air from recent surgery.
Following gadolinium, mild residual enhancement is seen at the margin of the surgical cavity in the frontal lobe medial aspect.
There is no acute infarct seen in this region.Surrounding edema has remained unchanged.
There is slight decrease in the mass effect on the right lateral ventricle.
The previously noted right thalamic lesion is again identified and is unchanged with unchanged surrounding edema extending to the midbrain.
There is mild prominence of the ventricles which is also unchanged from previous study.
IMPRESSION: Status post resection of the right frontal lobe enhancing lesion with mild residual enhancement at the surgical margin seen.
Expected post-surgical changes are seen at the surgical bed.
Enhancing right thalamic lesion again identified.
No acute infarct seen.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the hospital on [**10-9**] after complaining of increased headache in the setting of known intracranial lesion.
She was then admitted to the neurosurgical ICU for ongoing managment.
She continued to revieve Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.

Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**8-18**] days (from your date of surgery) for a wound check.
