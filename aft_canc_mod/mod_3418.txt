Admission Date:  [**2166-5-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-5-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-10-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1148**] Chief Complaint: abdominal pain and shortness of breath after elective colonoscopy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: colonoscopy blood transfusions  History of Present Illness: 63 yo F hx COPD (2L O2 at home), CAD who was admitted on [**5-7**] for elective polypectomy.
Experienced COPD exacerbation post-colonoscopy.
Pt developed a small amount of BRBPR after her colonoscopy, then at about 4 PM, she had a large amount of BRBPR about 1L.
She then was noted to become tachycardiac to 110 and BP dropped to 50's.
HCT noted to have dropped 10 points since this AM.
Pt notes increased abdominal pain especially when coughing and increased distention.
Pt denies chest pain.
Mild increase in SOB after agressive IVF.
Hypertension 5.
Hyperlipidemia 6.
general: pleasant, uncomfortable secondary to pain, mildly tachypneic, obese HEENT: EOMI, anicteric, no sinus tenderness, MMM, op without lesions, lungs: diffuse wheezes, poor air movement heart: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated abdomen: distended, decreased bowel sounds, diffuse tenderness, no rebound or guarding, extremities: 1+ edema skin/nails: no rashes neuro: AAOx3.
Pertinent Results: [**2166-5-7**] COLONOSCOPY: Findings: Protruding Lesions Three polyps were found in the cecum, ascending colon and splenic flexure.
SPOT injection was applied for tattooing with success in the splenic flexure.
Impression: Three polyps were found in the cecum, ascending colon and splenic flexure.
SPOT injection was applied for tattooing with success in the splenic flexure.
[**2166-5-7**] CXR: Small right pleural effusion.
[**2166-5-7**] PORTABLE ABDOMEN: No evidence of obstruction or free air.
[**2166-5-7**] ECG: Sinus rhythm and frequent atrial ectopy.
[**2166-5-8**] PORTABLE ABDOMEN: Significantly dilated loops of large bowel for which CT can be performed for further evaluation if clinically warranted.
[**2166-5-8**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia @ 125.
Poor R wave progression.
Atrial premature beats are absent.
[**2166-5-9**] ECHO: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic gradient is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
[**2166-5-11**] CT ABD/PELVIS: Uncomplicated cecal bascule, observed with 180 rotation, but without obstruction.
This appearance raises the possibility that recent symptoms could related to transient torsion of the bascule.
No evidence of free air.
[**2166-5-11**] KUB: Markedly dilated loops of bowel are again demonstrated, with large diagonally oriented loop of bowel extending from the pelvis to the right side of the abdomen measuring about 13 cm in diameter.
Although possibly due to a colonic ileus, the a volvulus or other cause of obstruction should be considered, and further evaluation with CT may be considered as previously recommended on [**2166-5-8**].
The endometrium measures 5 mm in thickness with no focal lesion.
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2166-5-14**]):       FECES NEGATIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Abdominal pain post polypectomy:  Patient initially admitted for pain control post polypectomy.
Pain improved.
Also had dilation of colon moderately that improved prior to discharge.
CT scan abdomen/pelvis showed cecal dilatation, with evidence of underlying cecal malrotation and hypermobility (ie.
abnormal fixation), which may result in cecal "bascule" or volvulus.
This may place patient at higher risk of volvulus or malrotation in the future.
No obstruction seen.
Stabilized without recurrence.
3) COPD exacerbation: Worsened after procedure.
4) Menorrhagia: Patient had episode menorrhagia after not receiving premarin for a few days.
No cardiac events while here.
6) DM Type 2: Patient had lower insulin dosing when made NPO and now back on outpatient regimen.
Found new infiltrate on CXR so started on ceftriaxone and will receive 7 days total antiobiotics (ceftin as outpatient).
Spoke with PCP who says patient has had leukocytosis for a while.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % (0.83 mg/mL) Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Rehab  Discharge Diagnosis: GIB post polypectomy post polypectomy syndrome COPD exacerbation menorrhagia Type 2 diabetes uncontrolled with complications Hospital acquired pneumonia cecal malrotation and hypermobility (ie.
abnormal fixation) Leukocytosis   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after a polypectomy/colonoscopy.
This was complicated by a gastrointestinal bleed and worsening of your COPD.
You also had an episode of vaginal bleeding while here when your premarin was held.
We recommend you consider follow up with a gynecologist to make sure there are no further abnormalities.
We found no clear no source of infection and recommend getting this repeated as an outpatient.
