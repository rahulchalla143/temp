Admission Date:  [**2101-1-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-1-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2037-9-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Codeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**] Chief Complaint: headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: NONE   History of Present Illness: HPI: This is a 63 year old man with ahistory of hariy cell leukemia that reportsseveral weeks of generalized fatigue and myalgia.
One week ago he developed headaches in the occipital region radiating to the rioght frontal area.
His PCP ordered [**Name Initial (PRE) **] CT head which showed a R frontal SDH and he was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift.
There is diffuse sulcal effacement and compression of the right lateral and third ventricles.
The basal cisterns are tight, but there is no evidence of uncal or tonsillar herniation.
Again seen is mild-to-moderate mucosal thickening and partial fluid opacification throughout the paranasal sinuses.
Unchanged right frontal subdural acute on subacute/chronic hematoma.
Unchanged extent of mass effect and leftward shift of midline structures.
Paranasal sinus disease.
Please obtain By 7AM [**2101-1-31**]    [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    63 year old man with R SDH with midline shift please obtian by 7AM [**2101-1-31**] REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    evaluate for interval change.
Right frontal SDH unchanged in extent, with no change in 7mm leftward subfalcine herniation.
No new bleeding or herniation.
Final Report INDICATION: 63-year-old man, followup evaluation of right subdural hematoma.
FINDINGS: The heterogeneous subdural collection overlying the right frontal convexity is unchanged in extent, again demonstrating both low and high attenuation components, indicating acute on chronic bleeding.
There is unchanged mass effect upon the right lateral ventricle.
There is no new intracranial hemorrhage, edema, new shift of midline structures or herniations, or evidence of infarction.
A nodular soft tissue density in the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle is unchanged.
An 8 x 19 mm ovoid, relatively hyperdense lesion abutting the left tentorium at the left cerebellopontine angle is unchanged, likely representing a meningioma.
IMPRESSION:  Overall stable exam compared to prior, with heterogeneous right frontal subdural collection consistent with subacute on chronic bleeding, unchanged.
Stable leftward subfalcine herniation with no new or herniation or bleeding.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: I agree that the right frontal subdural hematoma appears chronic.
However, the high density regions may reflect vascular membranes rather than superimposed acute hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted to the hospital for headaches, several weeks of generalized fatigue and myalgia.
He was admitted to the ICU for close observation and possible evacuation of the subdural collection.
