Admission Date:  [**2173-1-27**]     Discharge Date:  [**2173-1-28**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 83-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy who is admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit secondary to acute respiratory failure requiring intubation and in blasts crisis from acute myelocytic leukemia.
There were no witnesses.
He was found to be in atrial fibrillation by electrocardiogram.
He was given intravenous fluids and diltiazem AV and was started on intravenous heparin because of an elevated troponin of 4.3.
He was then treated with digoxin without effect and then Lopressor intravenously which caused him to become hypotensive.
The patient then began demonstrating a change in mental status.
Head CT at that time was negative for cerebral hemorrhage.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction 20 years ago.
Catheterization in [**2172-4-19**] showed three vessel disease, status post non Q wave myocardial infarction in [**2172-4-19**].
History of congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 21%.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
There was no jugular venous distention.
Extremities were without edema with chronic skin changes.
Immature monocytic cells on blasts suspicious for acute myelocytic leukemia.
In general, this is an 83-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy who presented in rapid atrial fibrillation, complicated by hypotension, requiring intubation, status post failed electrical cardioversion with spontaneous resolution to sinus rhythm and stabilization of heart rate and blood pressure on dopamine.
He also has a newly identified hematologic disorder with myocytes and blasts suspicious for AML.
Cardiovascular:  The patient became bradycardic to the 50s.
He was continued to be ruled out for myocardial infarction by acute coronary syndrome and attempted to wean off of dopamine.
No suspicion for an intrinsic pulmonary process.
Oncologic:  With myocytes and blasts on CBC and evidence of extensive bleeding at venipuncture sites, there was concern for TTP or DIC.
They recommended platelet transfusion if evidence of bleeding.
They felt that the patient did have acute myelocytic leukemia, however, this was not the critical issue at that time.
Later that evening, Medical Team had an extensive conversation with [**Doctor First Name **] Gaffin, the daughter of Mr.  [**Known lastname **], who expressed her fathers wishes to not have any heroic measures including defibrillation and mechanical ventilation.
In the setting of acute myelocytic leukemia and poor cardiac status and upon further family discussions with her on family, including Mr. [**Known lastname **] wife, they agreed that should Mr. [**Known lastname **] have a cardiac arrest, he should not be resuscitated.
He denied chest pain, shortness of breath and had no memory of the prior days events.
However, at 9:45 a.m., the Medical Team was called to see the patient during rounds for rapid atrial fibrillation with heart rate in the 150s-170s and systolic blood pressure of 110s requiring dopamine 10 mcg for support.
Diltiazem was given with no response.
While starting amiodarone drip, the patient became unresponsive with systolic blood pressure in the 90s to 100s.
The rhythm then converted to course of ventricular tachycardia with systolic blood pressures in the 30s.
