Admission Date:  [**2119-10-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-10-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2050-7-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Allopurinol / Vancomycin / Ciprofloxacin / Augmentin / Azithromycin / Linezolid / Cefepime / Iodine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Skin biopsy   History of Present Illness: 69M with AML s/p clofarabine with prolonged remission then recurrence, now on decitabine s/p completion of cycle 9 on [**2119-9-4**], COPD/emphysema, presenting to [**Hospital 3242**] clinic on [**2119-10-5**] with worsening shortness of breath.
His wbc was 1.2 with 29%N for an ANC of around 400, which is consistent with his recent baseline.
He has multiple antibiotic allergies and intolerances, including: Sulfa: Unknown Vancomycin: Rash (morbilliform, not red man) Cipro: Rash Augmentin: Rash Azithromycin: Rash Linezolid: Subjective SOB Several of these, however, were questionable, due to concurrent use of other medications.
He was seen by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2602**] [**Doctor Last Name 2603**] on [**2119-10-5**] in anticipation of this current admission, who noted that the PCN/Augmentin allergy was based on an uncertain history, but recommendation had been made for desensitization to any pencillins or carbapenems.
He therefore received cefepime 2gm in [**Hospital 3242**] clinic prior to admission, with no adverse effects.
He denies any preceding sore throat, nasal/sinus congestion, and admits only a mild non-productive cough.
He denies any new rash, pruritis, or oropharyngeal swelling since starting cefepime.
He does endorse significant nausea/vomiting over the last day, with no abdominal pain or diarrhea.
BMBx was consistent by report with myelodysplastic syndrome with presence of a 15-20% immature cells consistent with blasts; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt the pathology was consistent with MDS with excess blasts in transformation, suggesting acceleration of the disease towards acute leukemia.
Pt underwent induction and reinduction with single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] clofarabine per protocol 07-013, last treated in 09/[**2116**].
Since that time, he showed signs of dysplasia was dropping cell lines and bone marrow biopsy done in [**9-/2118**] showed blasts occurring in small clusters occupying an estimated 20% of the marrow cellularity.
Cytogenetics showed deletion of the long arm of chromosome 20 and he was treated on [**2118-9-19**] with his first cycle of decitabine.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - COPD/emphysema - GERD - ?
Angina (has been prescribed SL nitro for CP/neck pain that occurs on exertion with SOB, but states the tabs do not help, and reportedly has had normal stress MIBI) - Degenerative joint disease/arthritis of the spine .
He has no siblings.
Physical Exam: T: 100.2F, BP: 114/80, HR: 92, RR: 20, SaO2: 96% 3L NC Gen: Lying in bed, shedding skin, in NAD HEENT: Sclerae anicteric, oropharynx dry Neck: Supple CV: RRR, S1/S2, no m/r/g Chest: CTAB Abd: Soft, NT/ND, +BS Skin: Exfoliative scaling on the forehead, cheeks, neck with minimal residual erythema.
No mucose membrane lesions.
1+ edema in both LE, with erythema and RBC extravasation.
Imaging/diagnostics: - CXR: Minor new left lower lobe opacity, minimal pneumonia is possible, unlikely to be bacterial.
No focal airspace consolidation to suggest typical bacterial pneumonia.
Interval resolution of right upper lobe pneumonia.
Mild septal thickening compatible with mild fluid overload.
Mild bibasilar atelectasis, left worse than right.
No pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or lymphadenopathy.
- Video and barium swallow: Mild oropharyngeal dysphagia, without evidence of penetration or gross aspiration or significant residue.
Normal esophageal contour without evidence of stricture.
Intraesophageal reflux visualized with nonspecific impairment of gastric motility as described above.
No gastroesophageal reflux is visualized.
- Right buttock skin biospy: The histologic features are most consistent with a bullous hypersensitivity reaction, such as to a drug.
- Repeat CT chest: Generalized ground-glass attenuation throughout both lungs and septal thickening particularly in the dependent lower lobes, increased since [**2119-10-7**], likely pulmonary edema, either cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic (including drug reaction), less likelyatypical infection.
Severe centrilobular emphysema, stable since [**2116-10-9**].
- V/Q scan: Low likelihood ratio for acute pulmonary embolism.
- Bronchioaveolar lavage: Negative for malignant cells - Lower extremity ultrasound: No evidence of DVT in the right lower extremity.
Brief Hospital Course: 69M with AML, s/p completion of cycle 9 decitabine on [**2119-9-4**], also with COPD, presenting with worsening dyspnea over the last several days with non-productive cough, spiking fever in [**Hospital 3242**] clinic, with CXR showing minor LLL infiltrate.
Patient received a total of 3 doses, but had high fever (>102) and developed rash.
Desensitization was notable for breath episodes of subjective throat tightness that resolved after treatment with hydroxyzine, benadryl, and famotidine.
Patient never devloped respiratory compromise.
Patient remained afebrile for the remainder of the hospitalization.
Allergy was consulted and given need for empiric coverage in the setting of possible pulmonary infection and neutropenia, decision was made to de-sensitize patient to meropenem.
Dermatology was consulted who obtained a biopsy, the result of which is consistent with a drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction.
Patient was treated symptomatically for pain and discomfort.
Two days prior to discharge (off antibiotics), patient was noted to develop another morbiliform rash, which was consistent with drug-rash per dermatology.
# Shortness of breath: Patient has COPD at baseline and is overall deconditioned.
CT chest showed baseline emphysematous changes.
He had two episodes of hypoxia (O2 sat 88% on 3 L NS) during coughing spells.
# Angina: Patient had history of exertional angina treated with PRN sublinguial nitro in the past.
During the hospitalization, patient had one episode of chest pain with ST-depression on EKG.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended no catherization or medical interventions given low platelet count.

Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 22130**], you were admitted to the [**Hospital1 **] Hospital because you had fever and increasing shortness of breath.
You developed a body rash and high fevers, which we thought might have been related to the antibiotcs.
We asked the dermatologist to look at your rash and they did a biopsy, the result was consistent with a drug rash.
You had chest pain one night, with changes in your EKG.
We checked lab tests and you did not have signs of heart damage.
You had a video swallow and barium swallow done.
The results showed that you were not aspirating and did not have gastric reflux.
You started having fevers again, so we placed you back on antibiotics.
