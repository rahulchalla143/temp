He and his wife report that he has been having abdominal pain x weeks, and upon coming back from liberia a month ago, he was seen in [**State **], for increased swelling in his legs and jaundice.
An ultrasound was done which showed echogenic masses concerning for liver cancer.
He was seen in [**Hospital **] clinic on [**2138-4-25**] for abdominal pain.
He has been complaining of significant weight loss and poor appetite.
MRI yesterday showed extensive metastatic liver disease (IVC extension, renal vasculature extension, lung mets, and near replacement of the liver).
He was seen again in clinic today, when he was referred to ER because of these findings and abdominal pain.
CXR showed R effusion with elevation of R hemidiaphragm and nodules.
CT Head was performed - showed no intracranial mets, but did show blastic and lytic lesions in the skull.
He and his wife understand that he has cancer but it is not clear they understand the extent of disease.
+ SOB recent 30 lbs weight loss.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.

R periaortic mass, likely represents metastatic disease.
large RP mass diplaces IVC anteriorly and encases R renal vasculature and possibly upper pole of the right kidney 'largest lesion in R lobe is 16.4 x 12.2 x 16.6 cm', tumor extension into the R portal vein with enhancing tumor thrombus within the portal vein; main portal vein is patent; tumor protrudes into the IVC, No definite tumor thrombus in the R atrium, multiple nodules at both lung bases and along the undersurface of the diaphragm; large periaortic mass measures 10.5 x 7.3 x 13.2 cm.
R renal vasculature is involved.
EKG: NSR, Nl axis and intervals, peaked T's .
Renal U/S: IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Solid mass lesion in the right upper abdomen in close relation to the right kidney and the inferior liver.
This could represent an exophytic hepatic mass or retroperitoneal mass.
Renal arterial stenosis would be unlikely in this setting.
No CT evidence of intracranial metastasis; however, MR is more sensitive for detection of metastatic disease.
Multiple osseous lytic and blastic lesions may potentially represent metastatic disease.
Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm vs possible subpulmonic effusion.
Associated right base atelectasis vs possible consolidation.
Bilateral nodules suspicious for metastatic disease given history.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: Mr.[**Name13 (STitle) 112241**] is a 55yoM with h/o treated HepB, DMII who was transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital with MRI showing extensive metastatic liver cancer and labs showing [**Last Name (un) **] and hyperkalemia w/ peaked T's .
K improved to 5 after dialysis though renal failure remained persistent.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr acutely elevated to 4.2 from 0.75 on [**4-25**] w/ BUN of 87.
Likely ATN given multiple casts on sediment vs. obstructive component from metastatic lesion.
He remained oliguric despite IVF and aggressive resuscitation was stopped as his respiratory status began to worsen.
Renal U/S showed no obvious obstruction though did show an RP mass adjacent to the kidney.
# Presumed metastatic HCC: Large burden of disease on MRI the day prior to admission as an outpatient.
New diagnosis for patient.
# Tumor thrombus: [**Last Name (un) **] on MRI in R portal vein.
Will hold off on heparin gtt tonight given concern for coagulopathy and bleeding into hepatic mets.
Likely poor synthetic function in setting of extensive liver disease.
# Metabolic acidosis/lactic acidosis: Initial anion gap of 26 with lactate of 10.4 and new renal failure.
Likely related to poor clearance of lactate in hepatic/renal failure and extensive tumor burden.
# LFTs: Obstructive and hepatotoxic pattern likely both related to extensive tumor burden.
DVT prophylaxis was with subcutaneous heparin.
