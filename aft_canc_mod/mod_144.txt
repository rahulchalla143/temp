Per the patient, she had been experiencing constipation for 5-6 days prior to admission.
She did have a small BM on the morning of admission.
Her neighbor who was visiting noticed she was weak and dysarthric, and called lifeline who then brought the patient to the ED.
She also had a large loose BM in ED.
UA was nitrite positive with moderate bacteria.
CXR was concerning for left lower lobe pneumonia.
The patient was thought to have sepsis [**1-6**] to PNA vs. UTI, and she was given Vancomycin 1 mg IV x1, Levaquin 750 mg IV x1, and Tylenol PR 1 gm x1 and transferred to the MICU.
In the MICU the patient was started on Levophed for pressure support.
She then complained of being constipated, despite having repeated episodes of loose stool since arrival to the MICU.

OVA + PARASITES (Final [**2136-9-13**]):       NO OVA AND PARASITES SEEN.
Stool Cx ([**9-13**]): FECES NEGATIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
IMAGING: CXR Portable ([**9-11**]): IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for left lower lobe pneumonia.
The upper vascular redistribution as well as interstitial edema is more prominent in the supine view.
Again seen is an area of increased opacity projecting over the left mid lung.
There is no supine evidence of pneumothorax.
No pneumothorax.
Findings concerning for left lower lobe pneumonia.
Pulmonary vascular redistribution and interstitial edema.
Poor R wave progression.
Since prior tracing of [**2135-12-12**] left atrial abnormality is not seen on the current tracing.
CT Head ([**9-12**]): There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no mass, edema or shift of normally midline structures.
Extensive periventricular white matter hypodensities are present again.
There is an area of new and more conspicuous and extensive hypodensity in the left frontal lobe, extending to the cortex and subcortical white matter.
There is mucosal thickening in the maxillary sinuses, bilaterally, as well as ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
New and more conspicuous area of left frontal hypodensity, which may represent acute infarction.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF=60-65%).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver is incidentally seen.
Evaluation of the bowel reveals mural thickening involving the sigmoid colon as well as a portion of the rectum.
In retrospect on the prior exam dated [**2134-9-12**], there is suggestion of distal sigmoid and rectal wall thickening to suggest chronicity _____ recurrence of this disease process.
No lytic or blastic bony lesions are identified.
Sigmoid and rectal thickening as detailed above.
No acute infarct.
FLAIR hyperintense foci consistent with chronic microvascular infarcts in the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres.
Maxillary sinus disease.
Brief Hospital Course: # Abdominal pain/Diarrhea: The patient reported constipation for the 5-6 days prior to admission.
In the MICU, she complained of being constipated, despite having repeated episodes of loose stool since arrival to the MICU.
Once she was on the medicine floor, she reported a 2 day history of servere ([**9-12**]) constant burning lower midline abdominal pain that radiated down to her rectum.
She also complained of severe diarrhea and loose stools since admission.
CT abdomen/pelvis showed sigmoid and rectal thickening which is a nonspecific finding and may represent infectious or inflammatory etiologies as well as ischemia.
Of note, her admission in [**12-11**] noted "that the patient developed burning rectal pain during course of admission" which was felt to be secondary to referred neuropathic pain.
GI was consulted as there was concern for ischemic colitis given the patient's recent hypotension and lactate of 3.4 on admission.
She went for flexible sigmoidoscopy on [**9-14**] which showed erythema and edema in the mid-sigmoid colon and distal sigmoid colon compatible with colitis, and a polyp in the mid-descending colon which was not removed since the patient was on heparin SQ.
These findings were compatible with a resolving colitis including ischemic or infectious etiologies.
# Hypotension: On admission, the patient's blood pressure was 113/44, then decreased to 81/38 in the ED.
She became unable to respond to commands and was given 4 L NS with only slight improvement to 91/45.
A right IJ was placed, and the patient was transferred to the MICU with concern for pneumonia or UTI sepsis.
TTE showed mild symmetric LVH, LVEF 60-65%, and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Her neighbor who was visiting noticed she was weak and dysarthric, and called lifeline who then brought the patient to the ED.
She continued to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, which was likely due to delirium in the setting of acute illness.
Head CT showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage but did show a new and more conspicuous area of left frontal hypodensity, which may represent acute infarction.
Neurology was consulted, and they did not believe that the head CT findings were consistent with her presentation with bilateral upper extremity weakness.
MRI head/MRA brain showed no acute infarct, and FLAIR hyperintense foci were consistent with chronic microvascular infarcts in the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres.
# Pneumonia: On admission to the ED, the patient was afebrile, but SaO2 was 96% on NRB and she had a WBC of 19.6 with 88% neutrophils.
CXR was concerning for left lower lobe pneumonia.
She became hypotensive in the ED, and there was concern she had a pneumonia or UTI sepsis, so she was started on Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone and transferred to the MICU (she also got Levofloxacin in the ED).
# UTI: The patient has a suprapubic catheter, and is likely chronically colonized.
Urine culture showed fecal contamination, and the patient has a history of fecal incontinence.
