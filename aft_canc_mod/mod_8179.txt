TRACING #2   Read by: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] V.    Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 115 128 90 330/426 42 10 24   B. ECHO Conclusions The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No pulmonary hypertension or clinically-significant valvular disease seen  V. Radiology  A.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with persistent memory and cognitive problems status post head trauma and alcoholism and family history of multiple sclerosis.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images were obtained before gadolinium.
FINDINGS: Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of acute infarct.
Subtle hyperintensities on diffusion images in the brainstem appear to be secondary to T2 shine-through from mild T2 hyperintensities in the region from small vessel disease.
There is no evidence of periventricular signal abnormalities.
A few scattered nonspecific hyperintensities are seen in the white matter indicating minimal changes of small vessel disease.
Following gadolinium, no evidence of abnormal parenchymal, vascular or meningeal enhancement seen.
There is mild prominence of sylvian fissures identified but there is no evidence of dilatation of the temporal horns to indicate medial temporal atrophy.
On the coronal MP-RAGE images there is no evidence of atrophy of the hippocampi visualized or atrophy of the medial temporal lobe structure seen.
Following gadolinium, no evidence of abnormal parenchymal, vascular or meningeal enhancement seen.
IMPRESSION: Except for a few non-specific scattered foci of T2 hyperintensity in the white matter, no other significant abnormalities are seen.
The appearances are not typical for demyelinating disease but clinical correlation recommended.
No enhancing brain lesions are seen.
No evidence of medial temporal atrophy.
No pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax.
Minimal atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung areas.
There is no evidence of focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
No evidence of pulmonary edema and no pleural effusions.
FINDINGS: Single image from the operating suite shows extensive metallic fixation device about previous fracture of the proximal humerus.
Cervical spondylosis with posterior disc protrusions at C3-C4 through C6-C7.
The posterior disc protrusion indents the cervical cord at C4-C5 and C5-C6.
The right neural foraminal of C6-C7 is severely narrowed due to the above mentioned disc protrusion.
No definite acute abnormality identified.
Views demonstrate hardware related to a left proximal humeral fracture.
Correlation with real-time findings and when appropriate conventional radiographs are recommended for full assessment.
G. C-spine HISTORY: 43-year-old male with altered mental status and head strike.
There is no fracture of the cervical spine and no prevertebral soft tissue edema or hematoma.
Posterior osteophytes result in mild spinal canal narrowing at C6-7, C5-6 and C4-5 consisitent with degenerative changes of the cervical spine.
No fracture of the cervical spine.
Multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine with mild canal stenosis at C4-5, C5-6 and C6-7, which could predispose to cord injury in the setting of minor trauma.
MRI is recommended if there is concern for ligamentous injury.
Brief Hospital Course: 48-year-old male with alcohol abuse that presents with resolved polysubstance withdrawal, confabulation, resolved delirium, resolved acute kidney injury secondary to pre-renal etiology and elevated CK, baseline tachycardia at 100 that is status post left proximal humerus ORIF/K-Rod ([**2139-10-28**]) and repair ([**2139-11-4**]) secondary to repeat fall vs. non-adherence to sling.
ICU Course: Patient was admitted for ETOH withdrawal in the setting of left humeral fracture, having hallucinations and being minimally responsive.
# Altered mental status/delirium (resolved) secondary to polysubstance abuse/underlying medical issues In first twelve hours, the patient scored frequently on the CIWA scale.
There was concern for thiamine deficiency and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and aggressive thiamine repletion was undertaken.
He also has a history of psychosis although this is questionable upon record review.
Various issue have been ruled out for his delirium.
Given left humerus fracture, polytrauma was ruled out with CT Head not suggestive of bleed, CXR showed no evidence of traumatic injury, MRI of C-spine showed cervical spondylosis with a variety of abnormalities not suggestive of acute abnormality.
There was no evidence of organic brain disease on MRI.
He does have poor insight at times about his alcohol habits.
# Orthostatic hypotension with tachycardia and gait instability The patient had a mechanical fall prompting admission and felt dizzy getting out of bed in the radiology suite with subsequent fall.
During his earlier hospital course, he was triggered for tachycardia to 140 consistent with sinus tachycardia.
He also has had tachycardia on exertion elevated to 140 on exertion that is non-paroxsymal in nature per telemetry.
PT/OT evaluation showed orthostatic hypotension with tachycardia to 160.
In addition, he has had new gait instability since [**Month (only) 216**] per his mother.
[**Name (NI) 227**] confusing picture, neurology was consulted and felt based on additional imaging (MRI brain) that he had the sequela of chronic alcoholism.
# Tachycardia with trigger on [**10-30**] His heart rate was 100s-130s and as high as 160 during first the first 48 hours of hospitalization with SBPs 110s-160s.
Differential included pain, surgery, and alcohol withdrawal.
There was a concern for thiamine deficiency leading to beriberi prompted echocardiogram with reported attached.
The patient was triggered on [**10-30**] for sinus tachycardia to the 130s responsive to fluids.
His tachycardia has likely been multifactorial and the etiology remains unknown definitively except that orthostasis may have played a role.
# Left humerus fracture status post ORIF ([**2139-10-28**]) and status post repair ([**2139-11-4**]) after fall The patient had suffered a left humerus fracture from his fall.
injury from the fall vs. non-adherence with his splint.
# Recurrent pyrexia The patient was febrile in both the ICU and on the floor.
In the post-op period, aspiration pneumonia and UTI were ruled out in addition to wound infection.There has been no identifiable source of infection with cultures, and UE US for DVT has been negative given Left > Right upper extremity swelling.
# Left extremity swelling and erythema Given warm and left greater than right upper extremity swelling, surgery was called to re-evaulate wound on initial surgery.
Upper extremity US to rule out DVT showed superficial basilic clot.
He extremity edema has nearly resolved on discharge.
# Acute kidney injury secondary to elevated CPKs, pre-renal, resolved Cr at admission of 2.21 now down to baseline with CK and volume depletion likely contributers.
# Neck pain, resolved The patient had complained of neck pain and was placed in a c-spine collar.
MRI was performed given point tenderness over spinous processes.
MRI of the spine showed no acute abnormality but some anatomical issues.
It is perhaps possible that he may have had ligamentous strain from fall.
This pain subsequently resolved after a few days.
# Anemia with thrombocytosis The patient had anemia on admission (Hgb 13) likely secondary to nutritional disorder, blood loss, and marrow-supressive effect of alcohol.
He had mild blood loss during both procedures.
The etiology of his anemia is unknown.
A JAK2 mutation was ordered to rule out underlying myleoproliferative disease, and he was placed on aspirin given platelets greater than 1090.
# Transaminitis: The patient has initial LFT elevation on admission (ALT 89 AST 260 LDH 459 CPK 4207 ALP 79 Tot Bili 1) with subsequent downtrend to normal range with remaining isolated LDH elevation.
Suspect acute alcohol ingestion along with component of muscle damage given concomitant CK.
