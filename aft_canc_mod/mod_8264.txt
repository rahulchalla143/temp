Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Excision of angiosarcoma, reconstruction of right atrium with bovine pericardial patch [**2157-11-14**]   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 year old female with a known mediastinal angiosarcoma.
She initially presented in [**2157-2-13**] with dyspnea, fevers and weight loss.
Extensive workup revealed a 10.0 cm mass arising from the pericardium.
The radiation course was complicated by nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, esophagitis and a 10-pound weight loss.
She also reports ongoing fatigue, dry cough and episodes of lightheadedness with standing, and diarrhea.
Family History: Her mother had coronary artery disease and a myocardial infarction.
Her father had coronary artery disease and "metastatic cancer".

No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta with no atherosclerotic plaque.
See Conclusions for post-bypass data Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is normal in size.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is 10cm x 10cm echodense mass seen adjacent to the right atrium.
The mass seems to be encroaching the SVC.
There is no compression of SVC.
There is right atrial compression.
No signs of pericardial tamponade.
The mass does not seem to be entering RA or SVC cavity.
There is no definite space seen between the right atrial wall and the mass suggesting adherent mass.
RV has mild global systolic dysfunction.
No new valvular findings.
No residual mass seen in theperciardium.
Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2157-11-15**] 7:59 AM Final Report:No pneumothorax or appreciable mediastinal widening after removal of midline and right pleural drain and endotracheal tube.
Atelectasis in the right middle and lower lobes has worsened and there is a very small right pleural effusion.
Small left pleural effusion is new.
A left internal jugular introducer ends at the thoracic inlet.
No significant left-sided effusion.
No pneumothorax detected.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):     ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2157-11-19**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
All tubes, lines and wires were discontinued per cardiac surgery protocol without complication.
Pleural chemistry revealed an Exudative  effusion pH 7.55, LDH 444.
Micro with no organism.
By the time of discharge on POD 5 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
