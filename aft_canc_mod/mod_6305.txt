Brief Hospital Course: Patient is an 88 yo female with history of HTN, Hypercholesterolemia, and atrial fibrillation who presents with lightheadedness and found to be in complete heart block.
1) CHB: On presentation pt was found to be in CHB with an escape junctional rhythm in the 40s, with some associated symptoms.
By the time she arrived in the CCU she was in her baseline afib and asymptomatic.
The differential included degeneration of her conduction system from calcific perivalvular disease (with calcifications on x-ray), vs drug effects from digoxin or metoprolol.
(Digoxin level was 0.6) Other less likely etiologies included to be acute ischemia (normal CEs), Lyme disease (no exposures), ischemia (CE's neg), viral myocarditis, infiltration from prior lymphoma (no sign on TTE).
Pt's coumadin was also held for possible permanent pacemaker placement.
Pt continued to have episodes of CHB, with HR in 40s but was never symptomatic.
She would then spontaneously pause, have a PVC and revert to her baseline atrial fibrillation.
On day 4 of admission, INR had lowered to 1.8 and pt continued to have episodes of asymptomatic complete heart block and had a PPM placed without complications.
2) Afib: Pt spent the majority of her admission in atrial fibrillation without rate control.
Her heart rate remained normal, likely secondary to AV node disease and was determined to not require furthur restarting rate control.
