ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  This is a 81 year-old male with a chief complaint of hematochezia.
His past history includes emphysema and asthma.
Previous surgery includes open cholecystectomy and a questionable pancreatic abscess.
The patient had a colonoscopy, which showed a rectal mass at approximately 12 to 17 cm and a rectal polyp approximately 2 cm.

At this point he was noted to have low urine output.
He got fluid boluses.
Postoperative electrocardiogram showed a questionable ST depression in V3 and V4, less then 1 mm.
Cardiac enzymes were sent, which revealed only a slight bump in troponin consistent with ischemia not infarction.
At that point it was determined that the patient was slightly fluid overloaded and slightly anemic.
While in the Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day two his hematocrit was shown to be 24.8 consistent with mild blood loss and hemodilution.
Chest x-ray while in the unit was consistent with left ventricular failure, which eventually resolved.
Heparin subq was used for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
The patient was on Protonix for peptic ulcer disease prophylaxis and pain postoperative was managed effectively with morphine as needed.
