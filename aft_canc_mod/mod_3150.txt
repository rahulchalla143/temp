Now presents with worsened pain in left rib cage and lower back.
Of note, pt was admitted for pain control about a 1 month ago during which time imaging was concerning for impending pathologic fracture in vertebra, with worsening mets and spinal involvement.
Pt was briefly on Dex and her pain meds were adjusted so that her pain was back to baseline of [**2-17**] by time of discharge.

Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: Diagnosed with breast cancer in [**2109-3-7**].
In [**2111-2-8**] she had skull mass removed.
metastatic triple negative breast cancer s/p neoadjuvent chemo, mastectomy, radiation and s/p clinical trial 09-261 which is a Phase 2 study of ABT-888 (PARP-inhibitor) in combination with  Temozolomide.
In [**Month (only) 958**] [**2112**] she was found to have a lytic lesion at T9 and T12 for which she had radiation.
In [**Month (only) 958**] a CT scan showed progressive [**Last Name (un) 2043**] involvement concern particularly in the T5,T6 region for cord compression for which she had radiation.
A T9 lytic lesion with epidural extension was noted with a T12 compression fracture noted on a CT.
The patient has a had a recent ORIF of her right femur and had palliative radiation therapy to the left humerus and right hip and femur completed 3/[**2112**].
Other Past Medical History: 1. h/o lupus with chronic neutropenia.
H/o glomerular nephritis and vasculitis in the past.
Pernicious anemia on montly b12 shots 3.
Metastatic breast cancer  Social History: Her grandaunt had breast cancer.
Pulm: CTAB no crackles or wheezes Abd: soft, NT, +BS.
Extremities: wwp, no edema.
Skin: no rashes or bruising Skeleton: ribs: no deformity, diffuse mild tenderness over left lower rib cage, tenderness over Lumbar vertebrae, Non tender large (5-10cm) palpable occipital mass, No other areas of [**Last Name (un) 2043**] tenderness identified including left femur, left humerus, left proximal fibula Neuro/Psych: CNs II-XII intact.
Pulm: CTAB no crackles or wheezes Abd: soft, NT, +BS.
Extremities: wwp, no edema.
Skin: no rashes or bruising Neuro: motor- feet flexion [**3-11**] right [**4-11**] left, feet dorsiflexion [**2-12**] bil, knees/hips flex/ext [**2-12**],  DTR's are weak bilaterally, babinsky is indifferent bilaterally.
No sensory level.
Soft touch and proprioception reduced bil distal extremities.
[**12-12**] Bone Scan: INTERPRETATION: Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and posterior projections.
In comparison to [**2111-7-21**] exam, there are new areas of tracer uptake involving the mid diaphysis of the left femur, bilateral ribs and left humerus.
There is a new focus of tracer uptake projecting over left proximal fibula or possibly adjacent soft tissues.
The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer excretion.
IMPRESSION: Multiple new areas of tracer uptake involving the left femur, left humerus and bilateral ribs consistent with disease progression.
Unchanged appearance of the cervical spine compared to [**2112-11-1**], with metastatic disease at C6 and with mild spondylosis, but no mass effect on the spinal cord.
Interval enlargement of the large posterior epidural mass centered in the left posterior elements of T7, with severe compression of the spinal cord, increased since [**2112-11-1**].
It is not clear whether there is any cord edema.
Extensive osseous metastatic disease at other thoracic levels appears grossly unchanged.
Osseous and epidural metastatic disease in the lumbar spine appears unchanged compared to [**2112-11-1**], as detailed in the [**2112-12-16**] report.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 46 yo F with metastatic breast cancer who initially presented with worsened bone pain.
She was admitted for pain managment and underwent palliative radiation therapy, she subsequently developed clinical and radiological signs of spinal cord compression and underwent surgery for spinal decompression.
# Bone mets/Pain: Initially presented with worsened back and left chest pain with bone scan findings of new metastatic bone involvment in mid diaphysis of the left femur, bilateral ribs, left humerus and left proximal fibula areas.
Her pain was initially controlled with IV Dilaudid PCA which was subsequently converted to dose equivalent standing MS Contin and MSIR for breakthrough pain.
She was also evaluated by the radiation oncology team and underwent radiotherapy to the thoracic spine and left anterolateral ribs.
# spinal cord compression: On [**2112-12-16**] patient developed urinary retention, sadalle anesthesia and noted decreased strength in her lower extremities.
A foley catheter was placed and an MRI of the lumbar spine was obtained which revealed unchanged appearance of extensive osseous and epidural metastatic disease without encroachment on the distal spinal cord or cauda equina.
Tumor extension into L2-L3 and L4-L5 neural foramen was again noted abutting the exiting nerve roots and multiple pathologic vertebral fractures noted.
Subsequent progression of her lower extremity weakneess to 0-1/5 in all muscle groups was worked up on [**2112-12-18**] with a complete spine MRI which revealed interval enlargement of the large posterior epidural mass centered in the left posterior elements of T7, with severe compression of the spinal cord.
High-dose Decadron was started and on [**12-19**] the patient underwent Thoracic laminectomy T5, T6, T7 with resection of extradural infiltrative tumor compressing the spinal cord.
Foley was removed with no subsequent urinary retention.
# Fever - Patient had history of intermittent fevers attributed to her maligant disease.
Throughout her hospital course she was noted to have transient temperature spikes to a max of 102.7.
These were not accompanied by any focal symptoms or signs and repeated physical examinations, urine and blood cultures and CXR did not reveal a source of infection.
# metastatic Breast Ca: patient was recetlry treated with Gemcitabine Cycle #: 1 Day 1: [**2112-11-17**], Last dose [**2112-12-1**] + Avastin Cycle #: 6 Day 1: [**2112-11-17**], last dose [**2112-12-1**].
# severe protein calorie malnutrition - per cachexia, low BMI and low albumin.
# Anemia: Pnt has long standing anemia which is multifactorial including chronic disease and BM supression by chemotherapy, She receievd 2X PRBC on [**12-20**] following her surgery, Hct subsequently remained stable.
# DVT PPx: recieved SC Heparin throughout her course .
