She presents feeling lethargic w/ poor PO intake for the past few days.
She was initially taken to [**Location (un) 620**] ED and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after being found have a K of 6.3 and dilated small bowel on [**Last Name (un) **].
She remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
She was also given kayexalate 30 mL x1 initially, but had no bowel movements.
CAD status post MI 3.
Squamous cell carcinoma of the bilateral lower extremities - The patient underwent excision of a squamous cell cancer on the right in 4/[**2102**].

ESCHERICHIA COLI.
>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.. .
Radiology Imaging: CT Abd/Pelvis ([**2102-7-15**]): INDICATION: 84 year old with history of carcinomatosis, abdominal pain and renal failure.
PET CT dated [**2102-7-6**] which demonstrated abnormal uptake in the anterior abdomen and pelvis concerning for peritoneal carcinomatosis and the proximity of the uptake in the pelvis to the prior colon resection site was concerning for recurrence of colon carcinoma.
The lung bases demonstrate mild bibasilar atelectasis and trace pleural effusions.
Abdominal ascites has decreased.
The gallbladder is somewhat distended without evidence of pericholecystic fluid or gallstones to suggest acute cholecystitis.
There is no evidence of stone or mass on the right.
The left kidney has also increased in size without evidence of hydronephrosis, stone or mass.
The increase in renal size is thought to be secondary to obstruction caused by the pelvic mass and or pelvic carcinomatosis.
The small bowel is somewhat dilated but does contain contrast proximal to the pelvic resection site.
Small bowel does not fill with contrast distal to the resection site and the small bowel segments seem somewhat tethered at the resection site, which may be secondary to adhesions.
These findings could represent an evolving small bowel obstruciton.
There is an ill-defined mass in the pelvis adjacent to multiple clips, which is markedly obscured by streak artifact from bilateral hip prostheses, and is concerning for tumor recurrence.
Cecum and ascending colon appears mildly thickened, and there appears to be soft tissue thickening in the right lower quadrant adjacent to the region of prior resection, concerning for carcinomatosis and or tumor recurrence.
CT PELVIS: Evaluation is markedly limited by bilateral hip prostheses.
There is increased amorphous soft tissue density in the pelvis adjacent to surgical clips with adjacent small bowel wall thickening and colonic wall thickening suggestive of increased carcinomatosis.
BONE WINDOWS: Degenerative changes throughout the thoracolumbar spine without evidence of acute fracture or malalignment.
Progressive peritoneal carcinomatosis; concerning soft tissue  mass/thickening adjacent to surgical clips in pelvis, partially obscured by streak artifact from hip prostheses.
Dilated upper mediastinum most likely related to volume overload and asymmetric position of the patient.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is an 84 you F w/ a history of remote colon CA and recent dx of metastatic cancer in the abdomen (unknown primary) who presents w/ a partial large bowel obstruction and hyperkalemia 2' to acute post obstructive renal failure.
Given her multiple medical co-morbidities and poor cancer prognosis, the family chose to change the patient's code status from FULL to DNR/DNI/CMO and she expired on [**2102-7-18**] due to cardiopulmonary arrest.
The etiology was likely post-renal given the obstructing pelvic masses and the fact that her U/O was less than 200 ccs on the first few hours of admission.
IR placed bilateral nephrostomy tubes which resulted in less than desired u/o, but allowed resolution of hyperkalemia to ~4.3.
Partial large bowel obstruction.
She was suspected to have a partial LBO 2' to her hx of bowel surgery for Colon CA and her new pelvic masses.
CT on admission was c/f evolving SBO (areas of adhesion near the resection site), and also noted the new pelvic mass and some abdominal thickening in the RLQ adjacent to the resection site c/f new cancer formation/carcinomatosis.
Pt had UTI (final read E. coli) and urosepsis (Klebsiella).
WBC never resolved during hospital admission despite broad spectrum abx (Flagyl, Vancomycin, Levoquin => Cipro after speciation of UTI pathogen).
Metastatic Carcinoma of Unknonw primary: s/p first round of Carboplatin/Paclitaxel on [**7-4**].
No transfusion given as dnr/dni/cmo.
