He was briefly placed back on vent and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].He was  normotensive here and not hypoxic on 100% but with altered mental status.
Narcan did not help and no new focal findings.

No true rhonchi or crackles.
EXT: No pitting edema, pale nail beds, no wounds, no cyanosis.

Left foot with nonpitting edema NEURO: Moderate left sided hemiparesis (at baseline), non-verbal but able to answer with simple questions, nods head.
Evidence for small left effusion unchanged  CXR [**11-5**] REASON FOR EXAM: 80-year-old man with hypoxia and respiratory distress and elevated white blood count, please evaluate for pneumonia.
Bibasilar opacity increased could be atelectasis, pneumonia or aspiration.
Standard PA and lateral views or better inspiration AP could further characterize this.
Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle is unchanged, altough it was partly excluded on this study.
CT HEAD [**10-31**]: IMPRESSION: Unchanged right frontal lobe heterogeneous mass with resolution of post-biopsy hemorrhage and pneumocephalus.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Limited study for assessment of pulmonary embolism secondary to technical factors.
Enlarged pulmonary artery reflective of pulmonary hypertension.
Moderate cardiomegaly.
No evidence of acute cholecystitis.
MICU Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the MICU for a hypoxic episode at rehab.
Flexible bronchoscopy was performed on arrival and showed focal tracheomalacia with airway occlusion.
He was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics including Zosyn, Vancomycin and Flagyl for possible HCAP/VAP and C. Diff.
Antibiotics were weaned quickly as pt was not hypoxic, not febrile, and had a negative chest x-ray.
He was kept in the MICU for thick secretions requiring frequent suctioning but was transferred to the floor as he was off the vent for over 48 hours and secretions thinning.
For his brain tumor, Keppra was continued for seizure prophylaxis and his neuro-oncologist was contact[**Name (NI) **].
Vancomycin was restarted [**11-5**] since pt was having increased sputum production, sputum cultures grew MRSA, he had an elevated WBC of 20, and ?
bibasilar infiltrates on CXR [**2171-11-5**].
He was not continued on Zosyn since MRSA was felt to cause of pneumonia given sputum culture results.
If he develops fever, increase in WBC, or increased sputum production, would consider broadening coverage but it was not felt to be neccessary at the time of discharge.
He continued to have diarrhea with rectal tube in place but had 3 negative C. difficile toxins, most recently [**11-5**].
Insulin was stopped since he was not requiring any in house and does not carry diagnosis of diabetes.
ASA 81mg daily was added given his history of MI and he is now approx.
We continued to hold Coumadin given recent hemorrhagic CVA [**9-2**].
Colace 50 mg/5 mL Liquid [**Last Name (STitle) **]: Five (5) ml PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Acetylcysteine 20 % (200 mg/mL) Solution [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) neb Miscellaneous Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for thick secretions.
