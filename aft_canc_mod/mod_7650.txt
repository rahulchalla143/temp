Right PTBD replacement and brushings, PTC of both drains  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 91793**] is a 77 year old lady admitted to [**Hospital3 29691**] on [**2-29**] for new painless jaundice and pruritis,found to have a possible obstructive mass on CT and underwent ERCP x2.
This showed a hilar stricture and cytology concerning.
Past Medical History: Ulcerative Colitis, Hypothyroidism, Breast Cancer with Left modified radical mastectomy >17 yrs ago, also received chemo  Social History: Widowed, lives alone with her dog.
NECK: Supple, no thyromegaly, no JVD, no carotid bruits.
ABDOMEN: Soft/NT/ND, no masses or HSM, no rebound/guarding.
2 capped PTBD drains in place EXTREMITIES: bilateral LE edema per patient's norm,non pitting.
SKIN: mildly icteric LYMPH: No cervical LAD.
Dressings clean/dry ext 2+edema   Pertinent Results: MICROBIOLOGY: Biopsy Brushings: concerning for malignancy.
Hepatitis serologies at OSH pos only for Hep A  EKG: Reviewed from OSH, no abnormalities  CTABD/PEL [**2168-3-7**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Diffuse intrahepatic biliary obstruction due to an irregular, 6.2-cm mass centered in the region of the gallbladder and extending to the hepatic hilum.
The appearance is suggestive of primary gallbladder carcinoma with involvement of the liver, or cholangiocarcinoma with involvement of the gallbladder.
No evidence of pancreatic ductal dilation or a primary pancreatic mass.
Stranding about the pancreatic tail with apparent nodularity is concerning for omental infiltration by tumor at this location.
Stranding and apparent soft tissue density adjacent to the hepatic flexure of the colon could represent omental/serosal metastatic disease.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
9-mm left adrenal nodule, not fully evaluated on this examination due to its small size and partial volume averaging effect, but could represent an adenoma.
Diffuse intrahepatic biliary dilatation secondary to a large hypodense mass within the inferior right liver.
The invasive nature of this lesion is suggestive of primary gallbladder carcinoma versus cholangiocarcinoma.
Sclerotic lesion within the body of T7 could be a metastatic focus.
Small left adrenal nodule which may represent an adenoma.
Small right pleural effusion, which is larger than prior.
CXR [**2168-3-12**]: FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate some linear atelectasis on the frontal view not visualized on the lateral, blunting of the CP angles that could be due to a small amount of pleural thickening or small effusion.
No focal infiltrate.
Mild degenerative changes of the spine with sclerosis and anterior osteophytes.
Bone scan [**2168-3-18**]: Single focus of tracer uptake in the thoracic spine corresponding to T7 mixed lytic and sclerotic lesion seen on recent CT likely represents osseous metastasis.
No other site of osseous metastatic disease is seen.
Attemped US guided biopsy [**2168-3-21**]: IMPRESSION: Biopsy not performed since no mass could be identified adjacent to the gallbladder or arising from the gallbladder wall and extending into the liver.
Focal T1 hypointense nonenhancing lesion involving the T7 vertebral body with adjacent area of intrinsic T1 hyperintensity likely represents a bone island with adjacent hemangioma.
However, given the history of primary gallbladder cancer/cholangiocarcinoma, possibility of a metastatic lesion cannot be entirely excluded and attention on followup imaging is recommended.
Right pleural effusion.
OSH RADIOLOGY: CT ABD PELVIS: neoplastic lesion in the porta hepatis most likely cholangiocarinoma invading common biliary duct, surrounded GB with significant abnormality in the right lobe of the liver most likely infiltration by neoplasm vs liver necrosis.
OSH US ABD: fatty liver, cholelithiasis with borderline thickness of GB wall, no evidence of acute cholecystitis  [**2168-3-12**] 9:30 pm BLOOD CULTURE      1 OF 2.

CTA report ([**2168-3-7**]) found diffuse intrahepatic biliary obstruction due to an irregular, 6.2-cm mass centered in the region of the gallbladder and extending to the hepatic hilum.
The appearance was suggestive of primary gallbladder carcinoma with involvement of the liver, or cholangiocarcinoma with involvement of the gallbladder.
Stranding about the pancreatic tail with apparent nodularity was concerning for omental infiltration by tumor at this location.
Biopsy was without evidence of lymphoma or metastases.
CXR was negative for pneumonia.
Blood and bile culture from [**3-12**] isolated vanco sensitive Enterococcus faecium.
On [**3-15**], a bone scan was performed to assess for metastases.
A single focus of tracer uptake in the thoracic spine was noted corresponding to T7 mixed lytic and sclerotic lesion seen on CT was concerning for osseous metastasis.
No other site of osseous metastatic disease were seen.
MRI to T spine demonstrated Focal T1 hypo intense non enhancing lesion involving the T7 vertebral body with adjacent area of intrinsic T1 hyperintensity likely representing a bone island with adjacent hemangioma.
On [**3-22**], a cholangiogram was done to obtain brushings as attempt to biopsy under repeat liver US did not demonstrate any liver mass adjacent to the stone-filled gallbladder or elsewhere in the liver.
Biliary brushings from cholangiogram  demonstrated atypical glandular/ductal epithelial cells.
A liver duplex US was done to evaluate CT finding from [**3-21**] of new thrombosis of the right portal vein.
Duplex did reveal occlusion of the posterior right portal vein branch and a Heparin drip was started.
ID was consulted and noted hospital course of fever, RUQ pain, and hyperbilirubinemia consistent with cholangitis and associated VSE bacteremia s/p biliary decompression with antibiotics for biliary pathogen fever.
Of note, she did receive a IV fluid and experienced fluid retention.
