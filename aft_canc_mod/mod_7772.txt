Admission Date: [**2110-10-2**]        Discharge Date: [**2110-11-4**]   Service:  TRA   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  An 84 year old male intoxicated status post fall from 6 feet downstairs with questionable loss of consciousness.
He was noted to have been drinking excessively and to have suffered a head trauma in this incident.
The patient is currently disoriented in the trauma SICU, with CAT scan that showed C5 lamina and spinous process fracture and vertebral foramen fracture around C5.
GENERAL APPEARANCE:  He is noted to be intoxicated and in no apparent distress.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Soft and nontender throughout with no rebound or guarding.
The patient was receiving q 1  neuro checks at this time and was wearing a hard cervical collar.
The patient was noted to be withdrawing his legs to pain still.
He was also noted to have decreased breath sounds at the bases.
The patient was also placed on prophylaxis for alcohol withdrawal and the patient also was extubated at this time without incident.
It was determined that the patient was currently at risk for re- intubation and would need two feeds for nutrition at this time and a OG tube was placed for this purpose.
The patient was also seen by ophthalmology on hospital day 2, consulted to evaluate for globe orbital floor fracture on the left and noted to be only reactive to noxious stimuli.
Also of note there was no evidence of entrapment at this time.
The patient's MRI, MRA showed cord enhancement and then on the left it was noted that the vertebral artery was not visible.
CT angiogram also showed a stenotic vertebral artery.
The patient was noted still to be having significant lower extremity weakness bilaterally.
The patient was also on an insulin drip at this time for elevated blood glucose on finger sticks.
4, [**2110-10-5**], the patient had an official read of CAT scan of his head and facial CT as follow up.
There was noted to be no change.
There was a left inferior orbital fracture with no signs of entrapment.
Haldol was given for agitation and Zyprexa and valproate were discharged at this time.
The patient was still tachycardic and hypertensive at this time with blood pressure up to 180/70 and heart rate into the 120's.
5 the patient was noted to have a temperature of 101.3 and cultures were sent and labetalol was required to control his systolic blood pressure.
He was noted to have coarse breath sounds at this time and on chest x-ray was noted to be largely unchanged with some signs of infiltrate.
5, [**2110-10-6**], in the mid morning at approximately 7:45 a.m. health officers were called to the bedside for decreased blood pressure and decreased mental status.
The patient briefly went into pulseless electrical activity at this time as the team was preparing was intubation and compressions were started.
CT angiogram showed stable occlusion of the vertebral artery at this time.
6, [**2110-10-7**], the patient continued to be tachycardic and hypertensive and was requiring Lopressor, hydralazine and labetalol drip now.
7, [**2110-10-8**], the patient was noted to have grown on culture strep viridans from his blood, likely oropharyngeal flora in his sputum, Enterococcus in his urine that was Pen sensitive.
7, [**2110-10-8**], who suggested there were possibly multiple etiologies of his fever, possibly from the sinus, from his lines, and from positive blood culture.
8, [**2110-10-9**], the patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram that showed no vegetations or any signs of regurgitation or other valve abnormalities with a plan to also have a transesophageal echocardiogram performed.
The patient was recultured for a temperature spike to 101.9.
9, [**2110-10-10**], the patient's hematocrit was noted to drop to 19 and urine output having decreased with persistent tachycardia.
The patient was also seen by Neurology on this date who recommended not using pressors to maintain a target systolic blood pressure and suggested continuing to treat sepsis and hemorrhage and to use fluid boluses if needed They also suggested to consider an MRI with diffusion to assess whether the patient has in fact sustained an acute infarct.
9, Otolaryngology was consulted to perform a tap on a left maxillary sinus that was known to be built up with fluid if the patient is now positive blood cultures with sinus, possibly suspected as a source,  At this time it was determined that this patient's bleed was likely retroperitoneal in nature in the study of recent trauma and anticoagulation and the patient continued to be hemodynamically labile suggesting a possible central nervous system process.
A right femoral ultrasound was also performed at this time to rule venous pseudoaneurysm and anticoagulation was reassessed in the background of this bleed with need for anticoagulation for left vertebral artery thrombosis.
The MRI/ MRA of [**10-11**], of the head and neck showed no obvious infarction.
11, [**2110-10-12**], Vancomycin was stopped and Lopressor was added for blood pressure control and urine catecholamines were also sent at this time to try to explain these possible sudden rises in blood pressure.
The patient now had his left maxillary sinus taps, 2 cc of blood tinged fluid was removed and sent for culture and sensitivity.
Levofloxacin was also started on enterococcus that grew back in the urine and angiography was planned for the morning.
Metoprolol was then given orally 2 twice day and [**2110-10-13**], the patient also received transesophageal echocardiogram that revealed no vegetations and no significant valvular abnormalities or regurgitations.
Maxillary sinus fluid was noted to be positive for Enterococcus at this time and the antibiotics given at this time were vancomycin and Levofloxacin.
CAT scan at this time was noted to show no acute infarcts and the MRI/ MRA of [**10-11**], of the head and neck showed no obvious infarction.
16, the patient was weaned off of all pressors and was having problems with agitation and accompanied hypertension and tachycardia that evening.
The patient was denying pain and was noted to be able to follow commands.
Sputum was found to be Methicillin- Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus positive.
17, [**2110-10-18**], the patient required two more units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 22.9, with a plan to obtain abdominal CAT scan if this hematocrit continued to drop.
The patient was unable to be kept negative in terms of inputs and outputs due to episodes of hypotension.
The patient was noted to have a bout of hypotension at 80/50 and the patient received bolus of Neo- Synephrine to which he responded well.
Pressor support was gradually weaned and sputum gram stain at this time showed no organisms.
On [**2110-10-27**], the patient was noted to have desaturations to 80 percent with tachycardia at 120 and blood pressure to 200/100.
The patient was noted to be unresponsive with rhythmic facial eye movements and decreased breath sounds at the bases.
The patient continued to receive Lasix for gentle diuresis after that was added as the patient still had mild wheezes and on Albuterol.
The patient tolerated this well with good oxygen saturations and no respiratory distress and without excessive secretion interference.
27, [**2110-10-28**], final reads were obtained of the CAT scan of the patient's head following this prior episode of diaphoresis and unresponsiveness, and rhythmic eyelid movement.
EEG studies showed no seizure activity.
The patient had to receive fluid and Neo- Synephrine drip basically for hypotensive episode.
There were no new cultures over the last 5 days and on [**2110-10-30**], the patient had CT angiogram that showed bilateral pulmonary emboli and the patient was then started on anticoagulation with Lovenox.
On hospital day No, 32, [**2110-11-2**], MRI/ MRA was requested by Neurosurgery to look for further possible thrombus in the cerebral circulation.
A chest x-ray was performed the prior day that revealed atelectasis but no signs of congestive heart failure.
Sputum continued to grow gram positive cocci and gram negative rods.
The patient was now actively screened for rehabilitation and noted to have received a bed for [**2110-11-4**], and on [**2110-11-3**], in the evening the patient received his MRI/ MRA that revealed no further thrombus in the cerebral circulation and on [**2110-11-4**], hospital day No.
This was noted to be not decreasing his oxygen saturations or causing any shortness of breath.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  The patient is status post fall likely due to intoxication.
Left orbital medial and inferior wall fracture, thrombosed right vertebral artery, possible right vertebral artery dissection, fractures of cervical vertebrae No.
5 and bilateral lamina fractures, spinous process fracture of cervical vertebrae No.
