Interval hemorrhage in left frontal metastatic lesion, with worsening surrounding edema.
Worsening dural nodularity and enhancement along the left frontal convexity, concerning for progressive dural metastasis.
Interval development of leptomeningeal enhancement in the left frontal and parietal lobes at the vertex, likely leptomeningeal metastatic disease.
Right frontal and parietal lobe enhancing lesions, are stable-to-slightly decreased in size, with mildly decreased surrounding edema.
[**2104-4-20**] pCXR FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, a pre-existing right pleural effusion has minimally increased in extent.
No left pleural effusion.
No evidence of pneumonia.
No pneumothorax.
[**2104-4-19**] LUE ultrasound: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left upper extremity.
Occlusive thrombus within the entire left superficial femoral, popliteal, peroneal, and posterior tibial veins with nonocclusive thrombus in the left common femoral vein.
Nonocclusive thrombus within the right superficial femoral vein in its mid and distal portions which has a subacute or chronic appearance, but is new since [**2103-11-2**].
This could be a technical artifact or reflect small pleural effusions with associated atelectatic change.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
No explanation for patient's drop in hematocrit.
There is no intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal hematoma, and no evidence of active extravasation into the gastrointestinal tract.
Innumerable hypodense liver lesions, progressed in size and number compared to [**2104-2-25**], compatible with metastases from known melanoma.
Asymmetric opacification of the left common femoral and distal external iliac vein relative to the right is concerning for DVT.
Bilateral renal cysts.
Small nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
CONSISTENT WITH CORYNEBACTERIUM OR PROPIONIBACTERIUM SPECIES.

The patient is a 56 yo F with melanoma metastatic to brain s/p parietal tumor resection and whole brain radiation, who presented from rehab with hypotension, lethargy, fever, cough and acute anemia.
She was treated briefly in the intensive care unit for sepsis and transferred to the floor on [**2104-4-18**].
Progressive left upper extremity weakness developed [**2104-4-20**] indicating progression of her melanoma.
# LUE weakness due to progressive metastatic disease: The patient's sister elected not to do further imaging but to focus care on her symptoms.
# Worsening Mental status changes: Likely due to her progressive disease and possible worsening of brain mets.
She does NOT appear competent to make complex decisions but can do review of systems.
# New LUE swelling: ultrasound negative.
Suspect this is from hypoalbumenemia and progressive disease.
# Bilateral LE DVT: CNS mets preclude anticoagulation.
# Diabetes and poorly controlled hyperglycemia on high dose steroids: treated initially with insulin sliding scale.
# Bacteremia- occurred in setting of clinical pneumonia and hypotension.
Given progressive melanoma, we have stopped antibiotics.
# Hypotension - Resolved.
Likely dehydration and possibly sepsis in setting of pneumonia.
# Anemia - Acute drop in the setting of her infection and sepsis.
CT showed no evidence of RP bleed.
Smear reviewed by heme but no schistocytes.
# Thrombocytopenia - Stable at 50k.
Occurred in setting of bacteremia and sepsis.
no evidence of bleeding, had been on heparin (now DC'd).
No evidence of DIC.
Peripheral smear without schistocytes to support TTP or intravascular hemolysis.
# UTI - pansensitive e. coli growing in cx.
# Pneumonia with sepsis & bacteremia: Had improved.
Continue nebulizers for comfort.
Using morphine and ativan for air hunger and anxiety.
# Metastatic melanoma: ECOG PS4 with progression of liver mets and recent hemorrhage in CNS mets (from which she has not regained her former functional status).
# Depression: contined buspar .
# Severe malnutrition: albumin 2.3 with poor po intake and ECOG PS4.
# UTI - pan sensitive e. coli infection was treated with Cefepime.
# Hyperlipidemia - statin was discontinued given the goals of care.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with low blood pressure and a pneumonia requiring intensive care, IV antibiotics and pressor support.
You developed blood clots in both of your legs that were treated with an IVC filter because you cannot have blood thinners with tumor in your brain.
Your Left arm became weaker due to tumor growth.
