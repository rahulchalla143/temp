Per his wife, he was also increasingly lethargic and nodding off while sitting on the toilet.
He denies fevers, chills, or abdominal pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: no recent weight change, fevers, chills, headache, visual changes, shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, constipation, melena, BRBPR, hematuria, dysuria, weakness, numbness, tingling  Past Medical History: Oncologic history: # Head and neck cancer: - Mr. [**Known lastname 35716**] presented with a pain in his right neck.
A lump developed in the area and he was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**] and laryngoscopy demonstrated a post-cricoid hypopharyngeal lesion and was referred to have a CT scan of the neck.
The CT scan of the neck revealed an enhancing mass in the right pyriform sinus with extensive conglomerate adenopathy in the right level 2 and level 3 nodes.
Biopsy of the mass was positive  for squamous cell carcinoma.
On [**2197-4-13**] he underwent direct laryngoscopy and biopsy of right pyriform sinus lesion and rigid esophagoscopy.
Pathology from this procedure revealed squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated.

RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2197-7-8**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
MODERATE GROWTH.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2197-7-9**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
Focal opacity at the left lung base, could be focal consolidation; however, cannot exclude nodule in a patient with cancer history, although less likely.
Nonspecific bowel gas pattern, with a few scattered air-fluid levels in the right upper abdominal quadrant.
[**2197-7-4**]: Chest X ray IMPRESSION: Increase of the left lung opacity consistent with worsening pneumonia.
Newly appeared bilateral parenchymal opacities, notably in the perihilar areas, suggest pulmonary edema rather than pneumonia.
Progressing retrocardiac atelectasis, the presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
There is no pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusions.
Extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities worse in the left lung have minimally improved in the right lower lobe.
These are a combination of pulmonary edema and preexisting left lung pneumonia.
[**2197-7-7**] Chest X ray: IMPRESSION: Worsening multifocal consolidation and increased left lower lobe atelectasis.
[**2197-7-8**] Chest X ray: Diffuse bilateral extensive opacities have minimally improved in the left lower lobe.
There is no evident pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
[**2197-7-8**] Trans thoracic Echocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20%).
There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is probably moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[RVSP 27 mmHg + RA pressure, with the latter almost certainly very elevated in the setting of significant tricuspid regurgitation].
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction in the setting of rapid atrial fibrillation.
Markedly dilated and severerly hypokinetic right ventricle with relative apical sparing, consistent with acute pulmonary hypertension with a chronically untrained RV (due to pulmonary embolism, hemorrhage, ARDS, etc.).
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
At least moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 35716**] was a 61-year-old man with head and neck cancer who presented with diarrhea.
He ultimately developed a pneumonia and passed due to complications of sepsis.
He was initially started on levofloxacin for empiric coverage for a pulmonary infection.
The following morning he became hypoxic after eating/drinking.
On [**7-6**] micafungin was added for fungal coverage due to persistent fevers.
MRSA grew from BAL sputum on [**7-4**] and on subsequent sputums on [**7-6**] and [**7-7**].
Despite aggressive fluid resuscitation, multiple pressors, and appropriate antibiotic coverage, he had signs of end organ damage.
An echo showed an EF of 15%, he had elevated LFT's, elevated lactate to 12.1, increasing coags and decreasing platelets indicating DIC, increasing WBC, and increasing creatinine.
His thrombocytopenia was ultimately thought to be due to his overwhelming infection and possible medication effects.
The day of his death his creatinine increased to 1.3 indicating renal failure from his sepsis.
Also in the differential was amiodarone toxicity as this was recently started prior to the increase in LFTs.
Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: Mr. [**Known lastname 35716**] [**Last Name (Titles) 35718**] went into atrial fibrillation with RVR.
However, his heart rate went back into atrial fibrillation after a few minutes.
However, throughout the next couple of days he again went into atrial fibrillation with RVR.
Diarrhea: His episode of diarrhea was thought related to a chemotherapy side effect.
