Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY - s/p 3 episodes of epiglottitis/supraglottitis requiring intubation in [**2145**], [**2149**], [**3-2**] - Amyloidosis - involvement of lungs, tongue, bladder, heart - CKD - thought secondary to disease progression - Diastolic dysfunction- likely secondary amyloid - h/o multiple DVT's (L IJ, L popliteal, L sup femoral)-IVC filter, due to R sided DVT propagation; on coumadin intermittently (due to fluctuating platelet counts on Velcade) - Osteopenia s/p Zometa infusions - HTN - s/p tonsillectomy - Hx of disseminated herpes in [**2146**] - Urge incontinence - Subdural hemorrhages in [**2-/2151**] in the setting of elevated INR  ONCOLOGIC HISTORY Multiple Myeloma TREATMENT HISTORY: 1.
With relapse of her myeloma, she received thalidomide from [**Month (only) **] to [**2143-10-25**].
Nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant from a sibling donor in 11/[**2143**].
Noted for recurrent disease in the summer of [**2145**] and received a donor lymphocyte infusion in [**8-/2145**] with relatively a stable disease after this.
Noted for slow progression of her disease in the fall of [**2150**] and status post a second donor lymphocyte infusion on [**2151-2-5**] given at a dose of one x10 to the seventh T-cell/kg.
Admitted on [**2151-9-13**] due to worsening renal insufficiency with creatinine of 3.4 and new lung mass causing right lower lobe collapse.
Following discharge, she was started on thalidomide for a short period of time, but was readmitted on [**2151-9-28**] due to left lower edema and new DVTs.
Received Cytoxan [**2151-9-30**] with Decadron 20mg X 4 days with no change in disease.
Received Velcade 1.3mg/m2 D1 and D4, but then admitted due to worsening lower extremity edema and increased creatinine.
C5 started on [**2152-1-31**] with D8 Cytoxan held and D11 Velcade held due to low counts.
Also on dialysis for renal failure.
Family History: Hypertension, no malignancies  Physical Exam: Vitals - T: 98.7  BP: 123/72 HR: 84  RR: 20  02 sat: 93-96% on 2L GENERAL: WD female, NAD, on O2 with some mild difficulty completing sentences SKIN: no rash noted HEENT: right eye with subconjuctival hemorrhage.
OP clear CARDIAC: RRR, no murmurs appreciated LUNG: decreased BS bilaterally posterior lung fields, clear BS anteriorly.
no rhonci or wheezes appreciated ABDOMEN:  soft, NT.
normal BS EXT: 2+ pitting edema BLE to knees.
Recurrence of a moderate left-sided hydropneumothorax.
Small loculated right hydropneumothorax is seen in the anterior portion of the right hemithorax adjacent to the mediastinum.
Persistent right middle lobe and right lower lobe atelectasis.
Decrease in degree of left lower lobe atelectasis.
Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions that have increased in size.
Hiatal hernia again seen containing stomach and omentum.
Diffuse permeative osseous lesions consistent with multiple myeloma.
Diffuse septal thickening, which may be due to hydrostatic edema.
Amyloid is an additional consideration given the history of this condition.
[**2152-3-10**] CXR: Small right apical collection of pleural air has appeared explaining the horizontally oriented right basal fluid level, reflecting small right pleural effusion.
Consolidation at the right lung base due to chronic atelectasis in the middle and lower lobes is more pronounced today than it was on [**2-17**].
Large cardiac silhouette is roughly stable, but previously aerated loops of bowel and a hiatus hernia are no longer evident.
Slight increase in size of fluid in right hydropneumothorax.
No significant change in the degree of atelectasis or right lung air trapping.
Right central venous catheter in right atrium likely against atrial wall and in vicinity of draining cardiac vein.
Diffuse permeative osseous lesions again consistent with multiple myeloma.
Large hiatal hernia containing stomach and omentum.
[**2152-3-12**] CXR: Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged and partially obscured by bibasilar parenchymal abnormalities.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions loculated on the right and with a pig tail on the left base are unchanged.
Patient has known chronic right middle lobe atelectasis.
There is no overt CHF.
The patient has a large hiatal hernia.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusion greater in the left side are unchanged.
Chronic right middle lobe atelectases and bibasilar atelectases are unchanged.
There is no overt CHF.
female with h/o Multiple myeloma and Amyloidosis s/p auto and allo SCT with complicated medical history including multiple DVTs, and sponatenous pneumothoraces s/p chest tube placement now admitted for hypoxia when she was seen in clinic with an O2 saturation of 86% on RA.
# Hypoxia: The patient's CT scan prior to admission was consistent with recurrence of pneumothorax on L side with also a loculated right hydropneumothorax.
She also has bilateral pleural effusions which have increased from prior.
Approximately 2-3 hours later, the patient became acute short of breath, hypoxic to the high 80s, and required non-rebreather mask to keep her O2 sat >93%.
She also became acutely hypertensive and tachycardic.
It was thought that the acute hypoxia was likely secondary to an acute inflammatory reaction to the pleurodesis.
Of note, while in the ICU, the patient was hypotensive with pressures down to 58/42.
She remained asymptomatic with clear mental status.
She was given gentle IV fluids to support her pressures without worsening her pulmonary edema and hypoxia.
# Multiple Myeloma: The patient has a long h/o with chemo/transplants.
# ESRD (CKD V): The patient is on Hemodialysis on T/Th/Fr.
# Amyloidosis: The patient has multi-organ involvement.
Thalidomide 50 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO qhs () as needed for hem-onc.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every four (4) hours as needed for anxiety.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every six (6) hours as needed for fever or pain.
Imodium A-D 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every [**7-2**] hours as needed for diarrhea.

You were found to have a pneumothorax and required a chest tube placed.
If you develop any of the following concerning symptoms, please call your oncologist or go to the ED: shortness of breath, chest pains, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, lightheadedness, dizziness, or headache.
