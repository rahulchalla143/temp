[**2108**] EGD: 1 cords of grade II varix was seen in the middle third of the esophagus.There was scarring from previous banding in the lower esophagus but no significant varices in lower esophagus.
Brief Hospital Course: Hospital course by problem:  # Anemia: Suspect GIB as guaiac positive on exam and has hx of varices.
EGD performed showed no active bleeding but grade 2 varices banded just in case.
CT abd showed no RP bleed.
No clear evidence of hemolysis.
They felt his anemia was due to a combination of splenic sequestration, alcoholic bone marrow suppression and possibly a very small chronic GI bleed.
# CLL: followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2148**], who had been aware of anemia and mentioned possiblity of hemolysis or marrow infiltration.
Previous hemolysis w/u has been negative and remained so now.
# Diastolic Dysfunction/CHF: Appeared volume overloaded on presentation with an increase in his weight and increased LE edema.
His CHF meds were held initially in the setting of a GI bleed but then restarted after the normal EGD with good response.
A repeat echo showed mild LVH, preserved EF.
# Afib on coumadin:  His coumadin was initially held and reversed with FFP prior to the EGD but was then restarted after no bleeding was found.
He will discuss with his primary care physician the utility of being on both ASA and coumadin given his risk for GI bleed.
Likely due to prerenal azotemia, especially after it resolved after fluid resucitation with blood.

It is worsening your liver disease and affecting your ability to produce red blood cells.
