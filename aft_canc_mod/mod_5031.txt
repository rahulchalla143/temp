He had initially presented to OSH with c/o 4-5 weeks of lethargy, fatigue, and generalized weakness associated with shortness of breath and weight gain.
He had been diagnosed with CHF and worsening renal function within the prior months.
He was evaluated in the ED by the Neurology service who felt the SDH may be related to underlying lesion, and not necessarily due to the fall.
He was loaded with Dilantin, and the following day a trigger was called for decreased mental status.
Today at 10:00AM patient had witnessed aspiration event while drinking juice.
At 15:15PM, floor resident called for patient complaining of abdominal pain.
CXR revealed developing RML opacity consistent with aspiration event.

# Hypoxemia: Likely due to aspiration pneumonitis vs evolving aspiration pneumonia.
- Levofloxacin and metronidazole given to cover aspiration pneumonia (day [**5-23**] on d/c) - checked ECG (no change) and ruled out for ACS - supplemental O2 to maintain saturation >91% given - CXR shows improvement of aspiration event .
# Mental status change: patient has had fluctuating mental status since admission, likely delirium.
# SDH: stable per recent head CT. No changes in neuro exam/mental status.
Per neurosurgery, no IV heparin, no coumadin x 1 week from event, SC heparin and baby ASA OK, will need repeat head CT with contrast once renal function allows in [**3-20**] weeks as above - although OK to restart coumadin by [**7-11**], will hold as pt high risk for repeat fall and bleed on coumadin -> defer to PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] not restart in-house (discussed with PCP's office) - restarted baby ASA at D/C .
# CV: Ischemia: No acute ischemic episode - ruled out MI with three sets of enzymes - no ECG changes - on rosuvastatin, metoprolol, baby ASA.
[**Name2 (NI) **] ACE-I given renal function Pump: EF normal; no acute decompensation - kept intake and output even - hydral for afterload reduction  Rhythm/A fib: paced, rate-controlled on BB.
Digoxin on hold given elevated level and CKD -> will hold on digoxin for now given risk for toxicity with poor renal function .
# CKD: Creat clearance 15-20 mL/min, likely due to diabetic-hypertensive nephropathy, but etiology not known.
No gross proteinuria.
Pt had been referred to nephrologist, HD had been discussed, and patient was going to see surgery for eval of AV fistula.
No acute indication for HD seen during admission .
# Type II diabetes mellitus: on glyburide at home - held on admission - insulin sliding scale used in hospital with QID FSG and on D/C  .
