She stated that she has noted confusion vs difficulty with words for several months.
She presented to OSH ([**Location (un) 1110**]) today where a CT i+ was performed and revealed a Left occipital mass.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
slight R pronator drift Sensation: Intact to light touch, propioception Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements, heel to shin, unsteady gait  Post op Exam: Gen: WD/WN, comfortable, NAD.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Multiple hypodensities in the liver too small to be definitively characterized on CT possibly representing simple cysts or hemangiomata.
No definitive evidence for tumor or infection  MRI head [**2103-4-16**] 1.
Large left occipital lobe enhancing mass with areas of central necrosis and extensive surrounding edema is most likely a metastasis, although the differential diagnosis also includes a primary glial neoplasm.
The lack of restricted diffusion within this mass excludes the diagnosis of an abscess.
Approximately 15 mm of rightward shift of normally midline structures, without evidence of central herniation.
Left occipital mass with central necrosis and extensive surrounding vasogenic edema and contralateral midline shift.
The mass is highly vascular and partly supplied by the branches of left PCA.
There is no evidence of an intracranial arterial flow-limiting stenosis, aneurysm or avascular malformation  Ct head [**2103-4-20**] Post op 1.
Expected postoperative changes in the resection bed include pneumocephalus and a small degree of hemorrhage.
Minimal subdural hematoma is seen tracking along the left parafalcine region and superior portion of the left leaflet of the tentorium cerebelli.
MR is more sensitive than CT for detection of residual tumor in the resection bed.
Unchanged left temporo-parieto-occipital region vasogenic edema associated with the previous left occipital lobe mass.
MR head [**2103-4-21**] Status post resection of left occipital mass.
No definite residual enhancement is seen.
No hydrocephalus.
Marginal restricted diffusion appears to be due to postoperative change.
Infectious work up was initiated to rule out abscess.
CT Torso revealed a liver cyst and cholelithiasis but no evidence of tumor or mets.
She went to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] for a formal ophthalmology evaluation.
She was trasferred to ICU for her acute post-operative course.
Post op CT revealed only postoperative changes.
She remained in the ICU on [**4-21**] and a post op MRI showed gross total resection with postoperatvie changes.
She is tolerating an oral diet, her pain is well controlled, she is neurologically stable, she is set for d/c home and will f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] accordingly.
