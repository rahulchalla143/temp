No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and mildly depressed global systolic function (LVEF45-50%).
The right ventricle is mildly dilated with borderline normal systolic function.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending thoracic aorta.
There is no aortic [**Month/Day/Year **] stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe mitral [**Month/Day/Year **] prolapse with systolic reversal of flow in the pulmonary veins.
There is prolapse of both anterior and posterior mitral leaflets.
The p1 and p2 portions of the posterior mitral leaflet are flail with multiple ruptured chordae visible.
The tricuspid [**Month/Day/Year **] leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
A tricuspid ring is seen, consistent with tricuspid repair.
Left ventricular function remains mildly depressed with an estimated EF of 45-50%.
There is no echocardiographic evidence of aortic dissection post decannulation.
Coumadin was resumed for history of AFib and PE.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD 5 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
