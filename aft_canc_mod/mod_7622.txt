Admission Date:  [**2142-8-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-9-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-7-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8104**] Chief Complaint: L hemiplegia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation in the ED for airway protection.
History of Present Illness: Patient is a 79 yo woman with PMH including HTN, hypercholesterolemia and remote hx of cervical cancer who has not seen her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 2 years was found unresponsive in her bed.
EMS found her with facial droop and somnolent but was able to nod for answers and denied HA.
HTN 2.
Hypercholesterolemia 3.
Hx of cervical cancer s/p resection and radiation therapy in [**2111**] 5.
Carpal tunnel syndrome 6. hx of syncope x2 - most recent in [**4-3**] --> normal stress test (MIBI)   Social History: Lives in ALF ([**Hospital1 **] House) - was homeless in the remote past per PCP.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: T 98.1 BP 111/50 HR 111 RR 30 O2Sat 99% with 5L shovel mask HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx: ET tube in place Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
No blinks to visual threats bilaterally.
Motor: Diffuse, mild loss of bulk with decreased tone on L side.
Reflexes: +2 for biceps and brachioradialis but none for patella and 1 for Achilles.
sputum cx: mssa and proteus mirabilis [**Last Name (un) 36**] to ceftriaxone c. diff: negative ([**9-5**])  EKG: Normal sinus rhythm with atrial premature complexes.
Intra-atrial conduction defect.
Left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary repolarization abnormalities.
Axis is plus 60 degrees suggesting a co-existent pulmonary or right ventricular disease.
Since the previous tracing of [**2133-3-16**] diffuse ST-T wave changes and left ventricular hypertrophy are more prominent and axis has shifted rightward.
No atrial septal defect seen by 2D/color Doppler (cannot definitively exclude).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).
Acute right-sided corona radiata and periventricular infarct with acute wallerian degeneration extending to the right side of the midbrain.
Chronic multiple lacunes in the basal ganglia and small vessel disease.
Multiple microhemorrhages in the brain, suspicious for amyloid angiopathy.
Diminished flow signal in the anterior circulation could be secondary to slow flow.
Non-visualization of the distal vertebral and proximal two-third of the basilar artery could be due to occlusion or slow flow from high-grade stenosis.
EEG: Abnormal EEG to slow background with occasional suppressive  bursts.
These findings suggest a widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.
Medications, metabolic  disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
Hypoxia is another possible explanation.
Nevertheless, there were no areas of prominent focal slowing although encephalopathies can obscure focal findings.
There were no clearly epileptiform features.
L ANKLE: Multiple vascular calcifications in the soft tissues.
Duct-like calcifications projecting over the ventral frontal parts of the talus.
There is an obliquely oriented lateral fracture of the malleolus, with only minimal displacement.
A small fragment of bone seen along the medial aspect of the distal fibular represent a comminuted fragment.
There is no other evidence of post-traumatic disease.
There is heterogeneous plaque in the proximal ICA and distal CCA bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.
No definite new abnormalities.
Cortical hypodensity in the frontal lobes is likely related to beam-hardening artifact.
However, subtle cytotoxic edema cannot be excluded.
The acute infarction in the right lentiform nucleus and corona radiata is unchanged, allowing for differences in modalities.
Unchanged chronic infarction in the left lentiform nucleus and internal capsule.
CXR: ([**8-31**]) IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe consolidation with small pleural effusion is very worrisome for aspiration, a component of atelectasis/collapse is suspected.. could be due to a mucous plug.
Lactate: 2.0 (0n admission)   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 78 yo F w/ HTN, HLD found down at [**Hospital3 **] facility w/ L hemiparesis, found to have R basal ganglia infarct, likely 2' to uncontrolled HTN.
EEG was done to rule out non-convulsive status given her encephalopathy but only confirmed moderate/severe diffuse encephalopathy without evidence of focality or epilieptic activity.
Per head imaging, she has evidence of old infarcts on L hemisphere as well possible explaining minimal movements on R side as recrudescence due to multiple medical issues including severe/stage IV sacral decibitus ulcer which required bedside cauterization x2 for bleeding.
She required 3 units of PRBC transfusion while in ED for anemia with hct as low as 10.9 at nadir.
She had repeat head imaging when her somnolence increased to rule out hemorrhage which showed no change since admission and her somnolence decreased with transfusion supporting metabolic etiology behind her encephalopathy.
On admission, she was afebrile without leukocytosis but start HD #3, her WBC trended upward and she spiked with fever up to 101.7.
She was pan-cultured twice while in the ICU without identification of infective organism and because she deferevesced without intervention, she was not started on empiric ABX while in the ICU.
Additionally, patient had elevated troponin (crested at 0.26) without signs of renal failure plus non ST-elevated EKG changes not previously seen likely supporting NSTEMI.
Also, her L ankle seemed asymmetrically more swollen that R plus given hx of patient being found down, trauma series were performed and showed L ankle, non-displaced fibular fracture.
Floor Course: #Pneumonia: Patient with hospital acquired pneumonia vs ventilator associated PNA vs. aspiration PNA in setting of CVA, placement of NG tube, and intubation for three days (CXR from [**9-1**] showed increasing RLL opacity) Sputum GS grew Methicillin sensitive staph aureus and pan-sensitive proteus (received 3 days of Zosyn which was switched to ceftriaxone on [**9-5**].)
In addition, patient had a speech and swallow consult which deemed her unable to swallow and with multiple secretions, and at risk for aspiration.
Eventually had a PEG placed by interventional radiology with no complications.
Her stroke work-up included a TTE w/o ASD, thrombus, or focal wall motion abnormality, a carotid U/S shwoing <40% narrowing of ICAs.
Lipid panel c/w hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia.
L sided weakness may be recrudescence of old stroke.
#Anemia: Pt had coffee ground emesis on first day of admission, which resolved.
No evidence of gross blood in stool.
No B12 deficiency, no evidence of hemolysis.
Sacral decub ulcer was not oozing blood.
GI was consulted who recommended a short course of misoprostol while in house and EGD if patient continued to have evidence of continued GI bleed.
Other etiologies included decubitus ulcer and pneumonia.
Had chronic NG tube, but no evidence of sinusitis on exam.
Unlikely cardiogenic or obstructive (TTE neg for tamponade, EF 55%), or autonomic dysfunction related to stroke.
Her hypotension resolved with fluid boluses and her beta blocker was initially held.
She was treated with antibiotics for HAP (see above) and treated for her urosepsis w/ Ciprofloxacin.
She became afebrile x48 hrs and her hypotension resolved.
#Hyponatremia: Patient was hyponatremic on transfer to floor, likely related to excessive free h20 boluses.
Required cauterization of bleeding vessels, remained stable afterwards with no oozing.
Plastics followed the patient, and they did not see bone exposure and did not believe patient was at risk for osteomyelitis.
Vit A, C, and ZnSO4 for wound healing (should get 5 more days of ZnSO4 at rehabilitation, then med should be discontinued.)
#Guiac positive stools: Pt has intermittently guiac positive stools in setting of heparin sq.
No frank blood or BRBPR.
Hep SQ continued given need for DVT prophylaxis.
#Hyperglycemia: Pt was kept on HISS for tight blood sugar control in setting of improved wound healing.
