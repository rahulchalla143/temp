A right upper quadrant ultrasound was then obtained that confirmed acute cholecystitis with a large gallstone in the fundus and another large gallstone impacted in the neck of the gallbladder.
Given relative hypotension and low urine output likely secondary to the systemic inflammatory response from this septic gallbladder, I advised urgent cholecystectomy  Past Medical History: small bowel lymphoma chronic renal insufficiency (cr 2.0) hypertension  Physical Exam: afebrile, vital signs within normal range NAD, talking small amounts of english neck supple chest clear heart regular, no mrg abdomen soft, non distended, appropriately tender around the RUQ incision, which is opened at the lateral aspect and packed with saline gauze.

Brief Hospital Course: ID: Admitted and taken to the OR on hospital day 1, with diagnosis of cholecystitis from OSH - [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**].
Intraoperatively, a decision was made to perform an open procedure, based on the laparoscopic findings of purulent fluid intraperitoneally.
Postoperatively, the pt was taken to the ICU intubated for monitoring of her fluid status given the diagnosis of necrotic gallbladder and sepsis.
The pt remained afebrile throughout her hospital course, and on POD4, the vanc and flagyl were held.
CV: Troponin leak postoperatively.
Cardiology was consulted and interpreted this as being a troponin leak secondary to demand ischemia.
Pulm: Extubated on POD1 and given lasix for pulmonary edema, she did not have any additional respiratory events throughout her course.
Nephrology was consulted and recommended continued hydration for prerenal azotemia and ATN.
