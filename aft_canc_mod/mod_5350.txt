No evidence of acute infarction.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the oncology service after a fall and opthalmoplegia noted.
Ataxia on finger-to-nose is slight now.
However, given his fall risk due to severe dementia, and dysfunctional platelets due to MDS, and given the borderline positivity, anticoagulation with argatroban/coumadin was deferred, as the risk of bleeding was considered substantial.
Course was also complicated by hypernatremia, thought to be due to decreased hydration.
He should be monitored for signs of urinary retention and constipation.
Neuro exam shows slight up and down gaze, reactive pupils, areflexia and slight ataxia on finger-to-nose, in addition to the expected mental status findings given his dementia.
He will be seen as an outpatient urology - we recommend avoiding anticholinergics if possible, for fear of worsening dementia.
