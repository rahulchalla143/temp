The patient is status post right pneumonectomy for lung cancer and has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diagnosed in [**2110-7-5**] with myelodysplastic syndrome, also with new onset atrial fibrillation.
The patient presented initially with left-sided weakness and dysarthria which was on magnetic of ischemic paraventricular white matter on the right.
There was no thrombosis, no vegetation seen on echocardiogram.
After four days on the Neurology Service with great improvement in terms of his left-sided weakness the patient was noted to have decreased oxygen saturation down to the high 80s with tachypnea, was transferred to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit for possible intervention.
Along with the hypoxia and tachypnea he was also noted to have a lowgrade fever, a cough with yellow sputum, while his chest x-ray revealed a new left lower lobe infiltrate, Levofloxacin was started, giving his aspiration risk and sputum culture grew Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas and antibiotics were changed to Ceftazidime along with Levofloxacin.
Also of note, on the same day he developed atrial fibrillation which was new onset with heart rates of 170s.

and was discontinued due to worsening wheezing secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Electrocardiograms were performed on [**4-5**], [**4-6**], and showed no changes.
Coumadin was recommended for both his atrial fibrillation and cerebrovascular accident.
There has been amazing improvement in his lung examination with decreased wheezing and crackles that were noted originally at the bases.
