Focal right basilar opacity worrisome for pneumonia.
Mildly prominent pulmonary vasculature suggesting pulmonary venous hypertension, but not frank pulmonary edema.
Moderate cardiomegaly.
Calcified pleural plaques.
Brief Hospital Course: 84M with h/o CAD s/p CABG, prostate cancer s/p XRT, multiple UTI's, COPD on 3 LNC with severe pulm htn and severe R sided systolic function admitted for altered mental status with leukocytosis and evidence of UTI and Pneumonia.
# AMS:  Patient with acutely altered mental status.
He was found to have RLL infiltrate on CXR with associated leukocytosis and also found to have a dirty urine.
NC Head CT was unremarkable and revealed no acute pathology.
His mentation returned to baseline and he was afebrile with normalization of his WBC.
There were no other etiologies to account for his confusion - there was no evidence of CO2 retention based on the venous BG.
Sedatives were avoided and no restraints were indicated.
# presumed UTI: Pt w/ h/o recurrent UTIs including pseudomonal, proteus (R to cipro/bactrim/amp), enterococcus (R to tetracycline), and klebsiella.
UA on presentation consistent with urinary tract infection but urine culture returned negative.
He had some evidence of urinary retention - but difficult to assess post void residual given his incontinence.
He was placed on finasteride and may benefit from flomax or other alpha-blocker as outpt assuming he does not get orthostatic.
This should hopefully minimize the risk of future urinary tract infections.
# Pneumonia:  Right lower lobe infiltrate on CXR with leukocytosis no bands.
There initially was concern for aspiration given altered mental status and location of pneumonia.
Speech/swallow eval revealed no overt evidence of aspiration and the suggestion was to continue with present diet.
Sputum cultures contaminated with respiratory flora.
Of note, a single set of blood culture from admission returned positive for coag negative staph and iv vancomycin was initiated.
Incidentally, a MRSA Screen of the nares was performed to assess for the MRSA colonization.
There was however, no evidence of active MRSA infection.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine 2.7 elevated from baseline of 1.4-1.8.
Lactic acid elevated at 2.5.
Likely secondary to volume depletion in setting of infection.
Diuretics was discontinued and we recommend it to be held until there is evidence of congestive heart failure.
# Hyponatremia: Mr. [**Known lastname **] had evidence of hyponatremia - with discharge sodium of 120.
The patient is asymptomatic and was given single bolus of 500cc on day of discharge.
Given Mr. [**First Name (Titles) 11422**] [**Last Name (Titles) 167**] sided heart failure and severe pulm HTN, he is likely preload dependent and would require sufficient amounts of fluid to maintain adequate perfusion of the kidneys.
# Chronic Issues: R sided heart failure- gentle fluid boluses, cont metoprolol OSA- continue [**Hospital 11423**] nursing home does not know the settings  Transitional Issues: -Patient, Wife [**Telephone/Fax (5) 11424**] [**Name8 (MD) 2048**] RN  at nursing home   Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with confusion and was found to have both a pneumonia and urinary tract infection.
