Findings concerning for ischemic small bowel in the right lower quadrant secondary to an internal hernia.
New bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis, right > left.
New segment IV liver lesion, concerning for metastatic disease.
Extensive nodal and osseous metastatic disease, grossly stable.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an 82-year-old woman who presented with a 2 day history of abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting.
She had an elevated white blood cell count to 20,000 and a CT scan that showed a small bowel obstruction with internal hernia.
Risks and benefits of surgery were reviewed with the patient who was minimally responsive at this point but also with her family.
She was taken immediately to the operating room where an exploratory laparotomy was performed revealing a large segment of ischemic small bowel caused by a dense adhesive band in the right lower quadrant likely present from her prior appendectomy.
A small bowel resection was performed with primary anastamosis.
She remained hemodynamically stable postoperatively and was transferred to the ICU for postoperative care.
On POD#3 her respiratory status declined and she was noted to have an increased work of breathing and was noted to have opacification of the right lung on CXR.
On bronchoscopy it was noted there was a large mucus plug and that an ecotrin aspirin (which the patient had never received postoperatively) was in her right mainstem bronchus.
In discussion with the family, it was decided not to bronch the patient again if necessary and to attempt only non-invasive positive pressure ventilation.
She was first tried on CPAP and then later on BiPAP, with ever worsening acidemia and hypercarbia.
The patient's family asked to have a priest administer last rites and then decided to remove the BiPAP mask and make the patient CMO.
