Pt was having chest pain and an electrocardiogram showed ST segment changes in the inferior leads which was consistent with an inferior MI.
He had some vagal symptoms towards the end of the procedure and was treated with zophrin and atropine.

since (chronic proteinuria); now s/p renal transplant in [**5-/2154**]  -Idiopathic pericarditis [**2150**] -GERD -Anxiety, endorses dysthymic symptoms but not depression -Gout -Umbilical hernia repair -Restless leg syndrome .
Allergies: [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]--rash Simvastatin--myalgia Tape--rash HCTZ--unkown reaction  Social History:  Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco use; quit 25 years ago.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Mother had CVA at 46.
Sister with scleroderma and another sister with [**Name (NI) 18109**].
Physical Exam: Vitals: Vital signs stable, patient afebrile GEN: No acute distress HEENT: MMM, PERRL NECK: No JVD HEART: S1+, S2+ No murmurs.
He did develop an eight centimeter pseudoaneurysm and A-V fistula on his left groin site.
He was seen by transplant team for management of his transplant medications.
Renal was consulted for management of his Wegeners Granulomatosa.
Problem [**Name (NI) **]:  # CAD/Ischemia: history of CAD (CABG in [**2154**]), Pt had ST elevations on ECG in inferior leads with ST elevation in V3R, which are 90% sensitive for RV infarct.
Cath complicated by vagal symptoms towards end of procedure treated with Zofran and Atropine.
- Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], Statin - patient monitored on telemetry - As pt had RV infarct (by EKG, no right heart cath performed), avoid nitroglycerin for chest pain as RV infarct patients are preload dependent.
Pt with some orthopnea.
# Rhythm:  Pt having runs of NSVT on telemetry.
History of paroxysmal A-fib, has  cardioversion.
- monitor on telemetry - On Metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] for rate control, titrate up to home dose as BP tolerates - Will stop Amiodarone as NSVT was peri MI and did not recur .
# Hypertension: It was noted in a prior note on OMR that pt's blood pressure should be managed with beta blocker, a small dose of ACEi and Nifedipine.
If necessary Nifedipine should be titrated up as it is safe in the renal transplant setting.
- C/w BB and ACEi as BP tolerates.
Mild aortic valve thickening.
Systolic and diastolic bruit likely due to av fistula.
# Wegeners Granulomatosis: Has been in remission for 10+ yrs.
- Monitor respiratory status - Monitor HCT - Follow ENT recs Re: epistaxis prevention:  Saline nasal flushes three times a day.
# Renal transplant: End-stage renal disease secondary to Wegener's granulomatosis, received a living related renal transplant from his sister on [**2154-5-14**].
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure Secondary diagnosis: Chronic renal Insufficiency Wegenner's vasculitis Epistaxis   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Weigh yourself every morning before breakfast, call doctor if weight > 3 lbs in 1 day or 6 pounds in 3 days.
You had an inferior myocardial infarction with 5 drug eluting stents placed in your right coronary artery.
