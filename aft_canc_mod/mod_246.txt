He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up of his LFT abnormalities and for mental status changes.
In the ED here his LFTs were confirmed and an u/s shared a mildly dilated CBD without any GB wall thickening or edema.
He was stable until 10pm at which point he became hypotensive with systolic BPs in the 70's.
On ROS, he does relate ~50 lb weight loss over the past 7 months, which he relates to his 'water pills.'
Cryptogenic cirrhosis likely NASH; h/o confusion, with multiple admissions for suspected hepatic encephalopathy; on Lasix/Aldactone as an outpatient as well as Lactulose 2.
CAD status post stent x2; cath [**1-/2113**] with 2VD w/ stent of 80% LAD; no other lesion with more than 50% stenosis 4.
AFib status post DDD pacer ('[**12**] for symptomatic bradycardia, intrinsic rhtythm is Afib/flutter); previously on Coumadin, appears d/c'd after GIB 5.
Diabetes Mellitus 6. history of multiple UTIs 7. history of pancytopenia.
Eosinophilic syndrome 9.
Iron deficiency anemia, known trace pos stools.
H/O Upper GI bleed; grade I varices, grade II internal hemmorroids (cscope [**2110**]), no rectal varices 11.
Chronic renal insufficiency 1.2-1.6 at baseline.
Family History: His father with a MI at age 60.

A bulging of the major papilla suggestive of an impacted stone.
There was a filling defect seen in the distal biliary tree suggestive of an stone.
CTA ABD W&W/O C - [**2116-4-9**] - IMPRESSION: 1) Mild Pancreatitis, 2) Cholelithiasis, without evidence of acute cholecystitis, 3) Extensive colonic diverticulosis.
Pericolic fluid is most likely due to underlying liver disease, 4) Lesion in segment VI of liver which has been noted on prior ultrasounds from [**2115-12-28**], and [**2115-12-24**].
This is an arterio-portal fistula with refluxing contrast down the portal vein.
The findings are concerning for a mass in the liver causing this fistula.
Because of this, an MRI is once again recommended to evaluate the vasculature and in particular, to exclude an underlying liver malignancy.
5) All intrahepatic arteries, veins and the portal vein are patent without intraluminal thrombus.
6) Splenic infarcts.
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**2116-4-13**] 3:40 PM - CONCLUSION: Findings are consistent with cirrhosis and an arteriovenous fistula.
No definite vascularized portal venous tumor thrombus is identified, and the peripheral RPV thrombus hence appears on imaging to be bland thrombus.
However, although no focal hepatic mass is identified apart from the AV fistula, the patient's alpha fetoprotein is noted to be markedly elevated and the possibility of tumor thrombus cannot definitively be excluded.
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT  [**2116-4-13**] 3:40 PM - IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of partial, nonocclusive thrombus in the right common femoral vein, which may be chronic or acute.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 yo male c/CAD, CHF, DM, CRF and cryptogenic cirrhosis who is admitted for obstructive pancreatitis and jaundice now s/p ERCP .
PUMP - pt with known CHF, but continued to have stable O2 sats.
He was temporarily placed on IV Heparin, but Coumadin was held b/o history of GIB, and well as fall history.
DVT - it was noted by radiology that he may have a possible RUE dvt on his abdominal CT.
ANEMIA - pt w/ h/o GIB, with only grade 1 varices.
He was mildly guiac positive while on Heparin, and recieved 1U of PRBC's with Hct corrected to baseline.
DM - his prevous NPH regimen was held, and was covered with ISS.
HTN - his ACEi was held, and he was placed back on Diltiazem for rate control.
His BP remained stable without Lisinopril, so this was not restarted.
LIVER - his liver lesion on CT was concerning for HCC, and his previous AFP was 37.5 on [**2115-3-1**].
Will d/w hepatology, and felt this AFP level was likely diagnostic.
A 50lb weight loss makes this even more concerning.
It was unclear how much the lesion was infiltrating tumor vs AVM, and given the location and description he was not a surgical candidate, or a candidiate for chemoembolization or RFA.
