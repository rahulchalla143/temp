GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was admitted with an upper GI bleed.
He was found to have a bleeding vessel proximal to the ileostomy site which was sutured in the Intensive Care Unit.
Following this procedure, the patient had intermittent heme-positive output from his ostomy site.
The patient had a negative EGD at the outside hospital and a negative sigmoidoscopy 20 cm into the ileostomy with the exception of that bleeding vessel.
The presumed source of the intermittent heme-positive stools was either a small AVM in the small bowel or some mucosal erosions secondary to the chronic prednisone use.
In addition, he was found to have possible varices surrounding the ileostomy site and is to be started on Nadolol 20 mg p.o.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE: The patient's course in the hospital was complicated by a resistant pneumococcal pneumonia.
He remained asymptomatic from this infection through the remainder of his hospital stay on the [**Hospital1 **].
However, on the hospital [**Hospital1 **], the patient developed a left elbow cellulitis.
His white blood cell count decreased following the initiation of clindamycin and the patient's left elbow was clinically improved with decreased edema and erythema.
The patient had some residual tenderness in both elbows from his long-standing bed rest.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient developed anasarca during his hospital stay.
The patient had an echocardiogram which demonstrated no significant right-sided heart failure.
Furthermore, since he had no protein in his urine, the etiology of the edema was likely to be hypoalbuminemia from his poor nutritional state, combined with volume overload from his initial resuscitation.
for a continued diuresis of roughly another 7 kilograms or until his scrotal edema and lower extremity edema has resolved.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION: The patient, as mentioned, remained total body overloaded.
He had significant hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia with his diuresis and required aggressive potassium and magnesium supplementation during the diuresis.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient has baseline anemia, most likely multifactorial due to the CLL, chronic renal insufficiency.
Of note, the patient is a difficult cross match.
Gastrointestinal bleed, status post ligation of bleeding vessel near ileostomy site.
Pneumococcal pneumonia.
Renal insufficiency.
Left arm cellulitis.
