EXT: 1+ pedal edema on L to knee, circumferential erythema from knee distally, warmth, edema and induration, tenderness to palpation but not to manipulation of joint.

Discharge Chemistry: Na 140, K 4.1, Cl 102, HCO3 31, BUN 23, Cr 1.3, glucose 89, Mg 2.3  Micro data: [**8-24**]: 4/4 bottles Beta Strep Group G. MRSA screen negative Blood cultures from [**8-25**], [**8-26**], [**8-27**] NGTD Ucx: 10k-100k enterococcus, cipro sensitive guiac stool  Echo [**6-3**] - Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**11-29**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small (0.9 cm) circumferential pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2102-6-10**], the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased slightly.
Repeat ECHO [**2102-8-26**]: No evidence of endocarditis.
Moderate aortic, mitral, and tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Small-to-moderate sized pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade.
CXR port AP [**2102-8-24**]: Findings consistent with interstitial and alveolar edema, with bilateral pleural effusions.
Early pneumonia cannot be excluded and repeat imaging following diuresis could be helpful for further evaluation.
CXR port AP [**2102-8-26**]: Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates no change in the cardiomediastinal contour.
Left internal jugular central venous catheter is again seen with its tip in the SVC.
Assessment is limited by patient positioning but there is likely a small right-sided pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
LLE duplex u/s [**2102-8-24**]: No evidence of left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis  U/A [**8-27**]: [**5-7**] WBC, 0-2 epi, neg leuk es, neg nitrites, 0-2 RBC, few bacteria  EKG: Afib nml axis, nl intervals, TW flattening in all leads except leads v4-6; unchanged from [**2102-8-19**].
Treated initially with vancomycin, switched to penicillin G IV and continued to improve.
continue to keep leg elevated and teds stockings in place.
Also fungal foot infection slightly on dorsum of feet bilaterally and between toes, continue clotrimazole cream until clear and then for an additional 1-2 weeks.
Diastolic CHF- recent admission for CHF in setting of gleevec, gleevec held and patient diuresed and improved.
This admission for sepsis patient was agressively hydrated and then was in moderate CHF and diursed to nearly the point of euvolemia.
Please continue to administer lasix and titrate up if needed to goal of even to negative 500cc as she is still mildly fluid overloaded.
CML- on gleevec, thought to be cause of heart failure exacerbations as reportedly she goes into pulmonary edema whenever her gleevec is initiated.
ARF- baseline creatinine 0.7 to 0.9, ARF in ICU in setting of sepsis thought to be related to ATN, no improvement with diuresis of volume overload, Cr peaked at 1.3 in MICU and discharged with Cr of 1.3, would trend over time.
Stool guiac positive, plan was to start iron empirically and suggest outpatient colonoscopy however patient having difficulty with constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
