Patient states that on [**1-13**] he was in [**Country 6505**] visiting his brother when he developed SSCP associated with diaphoresis.
Went to the hospital and was found to have an NSTEMI.
Cardiac catheterization revealed three vessel CAD with mild LV systolic dysfunction (LAD 70% ostial stenosis, RCA Mid 90% stenosis, OM 70% proximal lesion).
Given that the patient had thrombocytopenia secondary to MDS versus CLL he was not taken for CABG.
After his return the patient saw his cardiologist who performed and nuclear stress test which showed inducible ischemia with minmal activity in LAD/RCA distribution.
Throughout this time the patient notes intermittent chest pain.
He notes that it is very difficult to differentiate between chest pain secondary to GERD versus a cardiac origin.
He typically notes worsened chest pain after eating.
Further should he eat and attempt to walk he will get worsened chest pain and shortness of breath which will reguire him to stop and rest.

Minimal decrease in size of the pre-existing left retrocardiac atelectasis.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
Left atrial abnormality.
Consider prior inferior myocardial infarction and modest inferolateral lead T wave changes.
Since the previous tracing of [**2157-3-5**] sinus bradycardia is absent.
Otherwise, probably no significant change.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mildly depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
