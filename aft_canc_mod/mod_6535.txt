Admission Date:  [**2144-4-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-4-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-2-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**] Chief Complaint: Hypertensive emergency.
History of Present Illness: 42 yo man with history of depression and suicidal ideation, anxiety, history of hyperaldosteronism, poorly-controlled hypertension, type A dissection s/p emergent repair ([**11/2143**]), type B dissection extending to iliac arteries, now transferred from vascular surgery service for further management of malignant hypertension.
In summary, he was scheduled for an elective fenestration of his type B dissection and possible left renal artery stenting on [**4-14**].
When he was seen in the [**Hospital **] clinic he was noted to have an elevated BP in the 220s, symptomatic and was taken to the ED.
In the ED, it appears he alluded to some SI and was thus admitted for SI in addition to management of malignant hypertension.
He reports having HTN (SBP >180s) over the past 10 years and has been on numerous meds.
He has been seen intermittently at [**Hospital1 112**] with lab data showing a history of hypokalemia (2.6) in [**2139**].
He also has undergone imaging which showed a 13mm myolipoma in the right adrenal in [**2140**] and [**2142**], but no adenoma.
During that admission, he was noted again to be hypokalemic and hypertensive requiring a labetalol drip.
His initial post-op showed a 17 mm myolipoma in the right adrenal gland and a type B dissection extending from SCL to internal/external iliacs.
Subsequent scans on [**2143-11-28**], [**2143-12-25**], [**2144-3-25**], [**2144-4-15**] have shown no change in the appearance of the right adrenal mass but have shown new left renal and left renal wedge infarcts.
It also appears that the left renal artery communicates with both true and false lumens with a flap noted.
Past Medical History: Type A aortic dissection s/p emergent repair ([**11/2143**]) Type B aortic dissection (SCL->ext/int iliacs; all major vessels originate from true lumen, left RA originates from both) Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Prior abdominal surgery s/p mesenteric biopsies Adrenal myolipoma Depression History of suicidal ideation  Social History: He currently lives at home with his wife.
Grandfather - HTN, diagnosed in his 30s; chest palpitations passed away 73 Mother - HTN, diagnosed in her late 30s Father - HTN, diagnosed early in life Sister - HTN, diagnosed in her teens Aunt - thyroid [**Name2 (NI) 3730**]  Physical Exam: On admission to MICU: General: Middle Aged, slightly depressed affect, NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, no scleral icterus noted.
Neck: No thyromegaly noted, no buffalo hump Chest: Lungs CTA bilaterally, no wheezes, ronchi or rales.
No gynecomastia Cardiac: RR, S1 S2, 2/6 systolic @ LUSB Abdomen: Non-tender, non-distended, normoactive bowel sounds, no striae.
CN II-XII intact Strength: [**4-14**] upper and lower bilaterally Sensation: decreased sensation to light touch in R lateral thigh and foot, but pinprick intact bilaterally  Pertinent Results: Imaging: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2144-4-13**]): FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect or vascular territorial infarction.
Slight caudal position of the cerebellar tonsils thus most likely represents incidental tonsillar ectopia.
Subtle loss of grey-white matter differentiation with minimal sulcal effacement, particularly at the vertex, raising the possibility of early cerebral edema, in this context.
Low-lying cerebellar tonsils, unlikely to be related to #1, above; this may represent coincidental tonsillar ectopia.
CXR PORTABLE ([**2144-4-13**]): IMPRESSION: Stable cardiomegaly and prominence of the aortic arch, unchanged compared to prior study of [**2143-11-27**].
Although there is no change in the mediastinal contours, complications related to prior aortic dissection and repair cannot be excluded and a CT of the chest should be obtained if there is clinical concern for such complications.
[**4-15**] CT ABD: CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a right adrenal lesion measuring 1.8 cm x 1.7 cm, which is predominantly fatty in attenuation, with internal Hounsfield units of approximately -70 [**Doctor Last Name **].
These findings are most compatible with a myelolipoma, and has not significantly changed from the prior study.
Immediately superior to this myelolipoma, there is a slight fullness of the right adrenal gland which is within the range of normal, without evidence of a discrete nodule.
A nonspecific punctate focus of calcification is seen.
However, there is no evidence to support adrenal hyperplasia or a discrete nodule, and is within normal limits.
Within the visualized lung bases, there is minimal dependent atelectases.
Within the left kidney, there are peripheral, wedge-shaped areas of low attenuation, which may reflect areas of renal infarct.
Previously noted suspicious area for infarct within the right kidney is not imaged on this study.
No free fluid or pathologic adenopathy is identified.
Visualized osseous structures reveal no suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesion.
Otherwise, the remainder of the adrenal glands are within normal limits, without evidence for an additional nodule or hyperplasia.
Aortic dissection, with dissection flap extending into the left renal artery, and probable areas of left renal infarct.
Brief Hospital Course: A 42 yo man with history of malignant hypertension, type A aortic dissection s/p emergent repair in [**11/2143**], type B dissection, and depression admitted for hypertensive emergency requiring ICU stay.
# Depression: Psychiatry was consulted in the emergency room when patient appeared depressed and endorsed suicidal ideation.
His symptoms improved with this treatment.
# Question of primary hyperaldosteronism: His refractory hypertension and hypokalemia prompted endocrine consult and imaging.
On CT, there was a right adrenal lesion measuring 1.8 cm x 1.7 cm compatible with myelolipoma, with slight fullness of the right adrenal gland within the range of normal.
There was no evidence of adenoma.
There may be a secretory adrenal adenoma not picked up on imaging or it is possible, given his family history of premature hypertension, that he has glucocorticoid remedial hyperaldosteronism.
# Left renal infarct: Likely in the setting of aortic dissection.
He denied flank pain during this admission and there was no hematuria.
Vascular surgery did not feel endovascular intervention was necessary and recommended blood pressure control as above.
# Type B aortic dissection: On CT scan, there was evidence of aortic dissection, with dissection flap extending into the left renal artery, and probable areas of left renal infarct.
