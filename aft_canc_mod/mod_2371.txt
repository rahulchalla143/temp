History of Present Illness: The patient is a 66 year old male with PMHx HTN and recently diagnosed follicular lymphoma who presents with dyspnea.
The patient has been undergoing workup of lymphoma since [**Month (only) 404**] when he developed night sweats and weight loss.
Imaging showed ascites, pleural effusion, and diffuse LAD.
Since his discharge though, he has felt increasingly unwell, with fatigue, worsening shortness of breath, and increased abdominal girth since then as well.
He has had persistent leg edema as well, left greater than right - an ultrasound during his last admission was negative for DVT.
He initially presented to [**Location (un) 620**] where CXR showed large pleural effusion.
Labs showed leukocytosis to 13, Cr of 1.3, lactate of 2.6.
He was given 1 additional liter NS, ceftriaxone/azithromycin as pneuomnia could not be excluded, nebs, and was placed on CPAP which gave him marked improvement in his respiratory status.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS.  Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.

Enlarged lymph nodes in the inguinal regions bilaterally.
Stable large left pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion.
Atelectasis at the left base  [**4-24**] Bone Marrow Biopsy SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY: DIAGNOSIS:      Hypercellular bone marrow with extensive involvement by follicular lymphoma MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION  Peripheral Blood Smear:  The smear is adequate for evaluation.
Red blood cells are normochromic and normocytic with anisopoikilocytosis including frequent burr cells, occasional elliptocytes, and macrocytes are seen.
Erythroid precursors are  normal in number and exhibit dyspoietic forms with irregular nuclear contours, asymmetric nuclear budding.
Occasional abnormal nuclear lobation and pseudo Pelger [**Doctor Last Name **]?????
Megakaryocytes are present in normal; abnormal forms are seen including several hypolobated forms, micromegakaryocytes, forms with disjointed nuclei.
Small cleaved lymphocytes are seen; no large lymphoid cells are seen.
It consists of a 0.9 cm core biopsy, trabecular marrow with a cellularity of over 90%.
Approximately 70% of marrow cellularity is comprised of atypical lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm and irregularly shaped nuclei; focal areas (<10%) of larger cells (centroblasts) with more open chromatin and nucleoli are seen.
Myeloid precursors have complete maturation to neutrophilic stage.
ADDITIONAL STUDIES:  Flow cytometry:  See separate report - shows involvement by Follicular lymphoma.
Numerous monomorphic small atypical lymphocytes.
[**4-24**] Peritoneal Fluid flow Cytometry FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING  The following tests (antibodies) were performed:  HLA-DR, FMC-7, Kappa, Lambda, and CD antigens 3, 5, 10, 19, 20, 23, 45.
B cells comprise 66% of lymphoid gated events and have a slight Kappa predominance (Kappa gain).
T cells comprise 28% of lymphoid gated events and express mature lineage antigens (CD3, CD5).
INTERPRETATION Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by follicular lymphoma.
Mesothelial cells and macrophages are also present.
[**2163-4-25**] Cytogenetics KARYOTYPE: nuc ish(MYCx2)[100],(IGH@,BCL2)x4(IGH@ con BCL2x3)[78/100]  Culture of this peritoneal fluid did not yield metaphase cells for analysis, therefore the chromosome analysis could not be performed.
FISH analyses of interphase nuclei with the IGH@/BCL2 and MYC probes were interpreted as ABNORMAL for the IGH@/BLC2 probes, consistent with rearrangement of these loci with an additional fusion signal seen.
IGH@-BCL-2 rearrangement is a typical cytogenetic aberration in a subset B-cell lineage non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of follicular center cell origin.
A normal MYC FISH finding can result from absence of a MYC rearrangement, from an atypical MYC rearrangement, or from an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.
The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.
INTERPRETATION:  Diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by B cell lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
[**2163-5-3**] Paracentesis Uneventful diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis with removal of 4 liters of milky ascitic fluid.
No definite pneumothorax.
Atelectatic changes persist at the bases and there is mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 y/o male with new diagnosis of follicular lymphoma who p/w dyspnea, found to have recurrent large pleural effusion.
# Respiratory distress - The likely cause of his respiratory distress is the large left pleural effusion, which is likely due to lymphoma.
He also had significant ascites causing increased diaphragmatic pressure.
Paracentesis successfully removed 2L of fluid and relieved his breathing, although he remained on oxygen support.
One Light's criteria was met but was borderline (Pleural fluid protein / Serum protein >0.5), likely c/w exudate [**1-20**] lymphoma.
Given the rapid reaccumulation of fluid from malignant etiology (confirmed by flow cytometry of pleural fluid), the patient needed more definitive therapy either via initiation of treatment for lymphoma or eradication of pleural space.
He subsequently received treatment with bendamustine and rituximab as below, but continued to reaccumulate pleural effusions requiring recurrent thoracentesis.
We eventually decided to place a left-sided pleurx catheter to allow frequent drainage of his malignant pleural effusions.
# Lymphoma - Paracentesis from [**Location (un) 620**] showed cells c/w follicular lymphoma, his lymph node biopsy was also c/w follicular lymphoma.
CT torso from [**Location (un) 620**] showed substantial lymphadenopathy throughout the abdomen.
Provided acyclovir to prevent HSV reactivation, particularly given history of post-herpetic neuralgia in legs.
Bone marrow biopsy performed [**4-24**] was consistent with follicular lymhpoma.
On first receiving rituximab, he developed a bas reaction, with tachycardia, hypertension and rigors.
During the desensitization, he had a mild episode of tightness in his chest with no decrease on O2 saturation.
He did however, continue to rapidly reaccumulate both pleural effusions and ascites, with multiple thoracenteses and paracenteses, and eventual placement of a pleurx catheter as above.
# Ascites: Malignant ascites consistent with follicular lymphoma.
# Lower extremity edema (L>R) - ultrasound of the LLE ([**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]) showed no DVT.
CT showed massive abdominal and pelvic lymphadenopathy that likely caused venous compression leading to asymmetric edema.
Repeat RLE USS also showed no evidence of DVT.
His inguinal lymphadenopathy and lower extremity edema had improved somewhat following chemotherapy.
He broke spontaneously and did not require vagal maneuvers or pharmacologic agents.
# Hypertension - Patient was hypotensive on initial presentation to [**Location (un) 620**] which improved with fluids.
Transitional Issues: - He weill require close outpatient followup with Drs [**Last Name (STitle) 3759**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 3274**] for ongoing management of his follicular lymphoma.
He will also need to followup with interventional pulmonology for management of his pleurx catheter and recurrent pleural effusions.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] will also arrange for recurrent therapeutic paracenteses as needed.

You were admitted with shortness of breath and abdominal distension from fluid accumulating in your abdomen and lungs due to follicular lymphoma.
We performed multiple taps to drain the fluid from your lungs and abdomen, and placed a catheter in your left chest to allow frequent drainage of the pleural effusions.
Analysis of the fluid was consistent with follicular lymphoma, and no other malignant or infectious process was identified.
You initially developed a reaction to rituximab, but subsequently underwent uneventful desensitization in the ICU.
During your hospitalization, you had a number of episodes of a fast heart rate.
We made the following changes to your medications:  STOPPED -Valsartan  STARTED -Escitalopram for anxiety -Acyclovir and Bactrim to prevent infections -Metoprolol for blood pressure and heart rate -Senna and Sodium Docusate to help move your bowels -Ondansetron for nausea  Please continue taking your other medications as usual.
