History of Present Illness: 77 yo left-handed woman with a history of left breast cancer, s/p lumpectomy and radiation treatment, melanoma s/p excisional surgery who was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] today after having been found to have brain mass at [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital.
The patient was in her usual state of good health when she developed a "massive" diffuse headache.
The patient did not have any insight into her deficits.
She presented to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital and was found to have a mass by CT head.

No definite uncal or transtentorial herniation identified.
No acute hemorrhage is identified.
IMPRESSION:  Poorly defined, large mass involving the right frontal and temporal lobes with a significant leftward subfalcine herniation.
MRI [**2109-3-9**]:  There is no evidence of acute infarct identified.
There is a large area of brain edema identified in the right frontal lobe extending to the basal ganglia region.
There is diffuse low signal visualized within the right frontal and temporal bone on T1 pre-gadolinium images indicative of infiltrative process.
The findings are most likely due to an extra-axial metastasis with involvement of bone.
There is mass effect on the right lateral ventricle and minimal midline shift.
There is no hydrocephalus seen.
There are no other abnormal areas of enhancement seen.
IMPRESSION:  Findings indicative of an extra-axial mass in the right frontotemporal region with infiltrative process within the adjacent bone and area of cerebral edema.
The extra-axial mass by virtue of its configuration and bony invasion most likely due to metastatic disease.
Malignant meningeal lesion such as malignant meningioma or hemangiopericytoma should also be considered in the differential diagnosis but appear less likely from the appearances.
CT torso [**2109-3-11**]:  Small, predominantly linear areas of thrombus are seen within the right-sided central pulmonary artery as well as subsegmental branches of the right lung and left lower lobe.
No significant hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is identified.
There is an enlarged lymph node seen within the left axilla measuring 12 x 19 mm.
Evaluation of the lungs reveals multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules measuring up to 6 mm on right along the major fissure on image #32 of series 3 and 4 mm on the left along the major fissure on image #14 of series 3.
Given the patient's clinical history, these pulmonary nodules are suspicious for metastatic disease.
A calcified granuloma is seen at the right lung base.
16 x 14 mm left adrenal nodule is seen.
There is a questionable, smaller 7 x 6 mm right adrenal nodule seen on image #61 of series 3.
Diverticulosis noted throughout the colon.
No significant intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy is seen.
Evaluation of the osseous structures reveals diffuse, predominantly sclerotic lesions within the femurs, pelvis, visualized portions of the spine, as well as the ribs bilaterally.
There is mild loss of height superior endplate of T12 vertebral body.
This may be secondary to metastatic disease in this area or possibly related to degenerative disease.
Several hypoattenuating lesions seen within the thyroid gland bilaterally measuring up to 9 mm on the left.
Multiple pulmonary nodules noted bilaterally.
Left adrenal lesion is seen as detailed above.
Diffuse metastatic disease with loss of height of several vertebral bodies, as detailed above.
No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.
Brief Hospital Course: Given the findings of the right-sided brain mass on CT imaging of the head, the patient was admitted to the neurosurgery service for further evaluation and management.
An MRI of the head showed a lesion that most likely represented metastatic disease and less likely a malignant meningioma or hemangiopericytoma.
Intravenous steroids were continued and Therefore, a CT torso was performed to investigate a primary source, and revealed diffuse metastatic bony disease, left axillary lymphadenopathy, multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, multiple small liver lesions, and a small chronic pulmonary embolism.
The decision was made to take the patient for a craniotomy on [**2109-3-14**] for diagnosis of the mass and relief of symptomatic mass effect.
Of note, a likely urinary tract infection was detected on urinalysis and she had a 7 day course of ciprofloxacin.
Post op she was monitored in PACU overnight, she had left sided paresis.
CT perfusion showed R MCA infarct.
CT [**2109-3-17**] showed Interval increase in vasogenic edema + mass effect R frontopari region.
