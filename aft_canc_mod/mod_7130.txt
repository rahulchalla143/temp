Back pain: Her pain sxs are from the sacral fx that is thought to be pathologic [**3-16**] XRT for her lymphoma.
Per Ortho notes on [**2178-9-13**], the fx should be in the process of healing now and her pain should be getting better.
Pt essentially here for better pain control.
Good control while lying down but in a lot of pain when attempting to sit or stand.
The pain service recommended Oxycontin, Oxycodone, Tylenol, Vioxx, and a muscle relaxant.
She was discharged on that same regimen for her pain before without control.
During the procedure, the pt received a large amount of IV fluids and blood products resultsing in CHF exacerbation and prolonged intubation as outlined below.
Pt's postop pain was initially controlled on a hydromorphone PCA and then changed to percocet on [**2178-11-3**].
Respiratory distress: Pt received a large amount of blood products and IV fluids during her spinal surgery resulting in CHF and inability to extubate.
CHF: Pt had a CHF exacerbation following receiving a large amount of volume during surgery.
A TTE was done on [**2178-11-2**] which showed a normal LVEF with diastolic dysfunction.
At that time, there was no evidence of CHF on CXR and she was becoming contracted on labs.
CAD: Pt has a history of CAD with placement of stents.
She had no evidence of ischemia during the hospitalization.
ID: Pt spiked a temperature on [**11-1**].
She was started on cefazolin emperically but found to have a left lower lobe infiltrate on CXR.
It was unclear if this was PNA or atalectasis.
