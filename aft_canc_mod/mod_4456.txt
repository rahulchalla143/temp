He was admitted from [**Hospital3 **] with an acute blast crisis after having low grade temperatures and fatigue at home which was initially diagnosed as acute pharygnitis and then progressed to n/v and abdominal pain as well as oliguria.
Since admission, initially to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he was started on leukophoresis x3 on [**3-11**], hydrea, 3 days of Idarubicin and 7 days of [**Month/Year (2) **]-C, and required CVVH for renal failure with subsequent improvement in creatinine.
Course was complicated by tumor lysis syndrome which improved with CVVH, allpurinol, plasmapheresis.
His CSF showed an atypical cell and thus he received three rounds of IT chemo (2xMTX and 1xAraC).
His counts recovered though this was complicated by neutropenic fever and was started on vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl and micafungin with resolutions of fevers.
His fevers then recurred and he was found to have CT findings concerning for angioinvasive aspergillus, blood cultures positive for VRE and C. [**Month/Year (2) 48411**].
He was also recently diagnosed with an enterobacter UTI and is completing a 7 day course of Cipro for complicated UTI.
His course was also complicated by a PICC-line associated DVT in R brachiocephalic subclavian vein, initially treated with heparin gtt and then lovenox with factor Xa level titration.
He also had a significant lower extremity [**Month/Year (2) **] followed by dermatology with biopsy consistent with drug hypersensitivity to [**Month/Year (2) **]-C, now much improved.
He has had persistent anemia, thrombocytopenia treated with intermittent prbcs and plts prn.
His digoxin had been discontinued due to fluctuated renal funtion and his metoprolol had been uptitrated for HR control as he is chronically in atrial fibrillation.
He additionally has hypocalcemia after treatment of hypercalcemia 2.2 tumor lysis and was followed by endocrinology who recommended discharge with Vit D and calcium carbonate.
He then had the sudden urge to vomit and had a large emesis of coffee grounds at around 2100.
He denies any epigastric pain at any time.
He then settled down and awoke this morning and had one episode of gross OB positive stool then frank melena at 8:30 am.
Given ongoing melena, GI and primary team recommended monitoring in ICU and EGD today.
He has no nausea, GI upset, chest pain, abdominal pain, urge to have a BM, dysuria, lightheaded or dizziness, weakness or other symptoms.

Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY 78 y/o Political Theorist with PMH of Atrial Fibrillation s/p Watchman procedure presents with M5-AML Blast Crisis and Leukostasis.
# AML M5 Type, Leukostasis with Leukemic Infiltration of Lungs, Kidneys, s/p Leukopheresis x 3 # Tumor Lysis, s/p Rasburicase # Acute Renal Failure, "Blast-Casts" in urine, s/p CVVH # Leukopoenia, s/p 3 then 7 ([**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]-C) # One Atypical Cell in CSF, s/p IT Chemotherapy (5/5,[**3-28**] and [**4-9**])  Originally presenting to his PCP with [**Name Initial (PRE) **] sore throat and diagnosed with strep throat (at which time he had a normal CBC), his symptoms progressed to include dyspnea and olgiuria.
He presented with a Creatinine of 7, elevated Ca, Phos, extremely elevated LDH and a CXR c/w with PNA or leukemic infiltration.
On [**3-12**], he was also started on CVVH concommitantly with 3 days of Idarubicin, which restarted his tumor lysis.
On [**3-17**], CVVH was discontinued, the patient was transferred to the floor and completed a full course 7 days of [**Month/Year (2) **]-C. His CSF showed an atypical cell and thus received three rounds of IT chemo (2xMTX and 1xAraC).
His counts would later recover with some complications.
# Neutropenic fever # VRE Sepsis # [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Sepsis # Aspergillus Lung Disease, Angioinvasive # Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome # Enterobacter Aerogenes UTI  Pt developed neutropenic fever and was started on cefepime, vancomycin, flagyl and micafungin during the course of his hospitalization, with initial resolution of his fevers.
His fevers then recurred and he was found to have CT findings concerning for angioinvasive aspergillus, blood cultures positive for VRE and C. [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] that prompted line removal.
He was diagnosed with [**Doctor First Name **] and started on 3 days of 120 mg SoluMedrol with a 3 day taper, to good effect (clinically, less O2 requirement and radiologically, improved CXR).
# DVT   Patient developed a provoked, PICC-line associated DVT in his Right Brachiocephalic-Subclavian vein that was treated out of concern that it was an infected clot, first with heparin gtt then with Xa-factor titrated doses of LMWH.
His upper extrem DVT also has less risk for PE compared to LE DVT.
# Cholestatic hepatitis: Also associated with mild transaminitis.
Thought to be secondary to medication effects (voriconazole, daptomycin) which were held but now restarted.
MR abdomen was performed on [**4-16**] which did not show a focal hepatic lesions and a normal biliary tree.
Iron deposition thought to be secondary to transfusion therapy.
He did have an abnormal US on [**4-7**] with gallbladder sludge and and mild intrahepatic bile duct dilatation.
Patient has no clinical signs or symptoms of cholecystitis at this time.
His statin was held for now but may be restarted as an outpatient if his LFTs normalize.
# Hematuria: initially resolved with foley removal, however then recurred later in the course of the hospitalization in the setting of low platelets.
# [**Name (NI) **]  pt seen by dermatology who biopsied the lesions on his legs.
# Anemia / Thrombocytopenia  Related to blast crisis and bone marrow insufficiency.
# Atrial Fib s/p Watchman Procedure  chronically in AF.
Digoxin level was normal on admission in the setting of ARF and was held while patient was on CVVH.
He required uptitration of metoprolol for rate control.
He does not require anticoagulation, given his watchman procedure.
Some may be dependent edema due to relative immobilization.
# Hyper/hypo-calcemia - hypercalcemia related to tumor lysis and ARF.
Completely resolved with aggressive hydration, however then became hypocalcemic with low vitamin D levels.
# HTN:  Patient had labile blood pressures as high as SBP 190.
# GI bleed:  On evening on [**4-19**] patient had 2 episodes of coffee ground emesis and a systolic blood pressure in the 70s.
On [**4-20**] he had multiple episodes of melana and was transferred to the ICU for urgent upper endoscopy.
EGD revealed an ulcer with a clot on the gastric side of the GE junction; two clips were placed endoscopically.
He was continued on a PPI twice a day and should have a repeat EGD in [**12-25**] weeks to assess for resolution of the ulcer and look for a mass under the clot.
