He is chronically on 2L O2 at home and increased to 3 L with residual shortness of breath.
Denies vomiting, fevers or chills, sore throat, diarrhea, or sick contacts.
His EKG showed a. fib with no other changes.
He had a CXR which showed a RLL consolidation.
Denies orthopnea, PND, blood in his stools, melena, chest pain, or dysuria.
CAD: s/p PCI to LAD in [**8-31**], PCI to distal RCA in [**2168**] at OSH, followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], last pMIBI in [**2-1**] with no new perf.
Hypertension 2.
Hypercholesterolemia 5. h/o A fib.
Laryngeal carcinoma s/p chemo and radiation therapy compleated 05/[**2175**].
(stage T3, N1 or stage III laryngeal cancer.
Followed with serial PET/CT and found on [**1-/2177**] a 7 mm right lower lobe nodule not FDG avid.
Repeated PET/CT [**Month (only) 359**]/[**2177**] [**Hospital1 112**] showed large right lower lobe mass 7x4.5 cm with extension to hilum.
Pulmonary consulted and given rapid change of mass treated with 10 days of Levofloxacin.
Repeated CT [**12-16**] whowed a large right lower lobe consolidation with positive CT angiogram with mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
Bronchial washing [**12-25**]--> showed suspicion for squamous cell carcinoma.
Transbronchial neuroaspirate was positive for squamous cell carcinoma.
F/u PET Scan on [**1-13**] reveal FDG avid right lower lobe focus witn bronchial narrowin and distal consolidation.

There is peribronchial thickening in the left upper lobe.
There are no focal consolidations in the left lung.
The appearances in the right lung most likely represent a combination of the known lung cancer and a pneumonic consolidation.
Marked increase in right lung consolidation, probably radiation pneumonia, less likely infection.
New multifocal alveolitis/interstitial pneumonia, left lung, could be radiation injury if the radiation portal was wider than expected, radiation induced cryptogenic organizing pneumonia or multifocal viral infection.
Newly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes since [**8-3**].
Newly enlarged left hilar lymph nodes could be reactive or neoplastic.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P:  60 yo male with pmh of CAD s/p stents, a fib, laryngeal carcinoma s/p chemo and XRT, and small cell lung ca currently being treated with chemo who presents with increasing SOB, cough, and O2 requirement likely secondary to pneumonia.
The patient presented with a productive cough, leukocytosis, increasing O2 requirement, and worsening SOB and a CXR suggestive of pneumonia.
As the patient was found to be in a. fib, some of his shortness of breath could be due to a fib with RVR.
He also had a known persistent malignant pleural effusion in his right lung.
He was initally treated with levofloxacin and flagyl, however he continued to require increasing amounts of oxygen, so his coverage was broadened to vancomycin and zosyn.
Due to his increased O2 requirement and tachypnea he was transferred to the MICU.
Steroids and diuresis were attempted in case there was any component of inflammation and/or volume overload respectively.
His dyspnea and hypoxemia continued.
Morphine was given for symptomatic relief and focus was made on patient comfort.
