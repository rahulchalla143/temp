His echocardiogram demonstrated mild left ventricular hypertrophy with inferolateral hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 40%.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital6 2018**] after desaturation, recurrent pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema with a persistent air leak.
He has a long history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and radiologic studies demonstrated multiple blebs and bullae in both lungs.
He continued to have a persistent air leak and on [**6-5**], underwent video assisted thoracoscopy with a wedge resection of a bullous thought to be the source of his leak.
