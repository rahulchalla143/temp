There are two hyperdense masses in the left cerebral hemisphere.
The second mass in the left parietal corticomedullary junction measures 1 x 1 cm with a small amount of surrounding edema and mass effect on the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
No osseous abnormality is identified.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Left frontal and left parietal mass lesions most concerning for metastatic disease.
CT Head [**7-20**](Post-op): FINDINGS: The patient is post-resection of a larger left frontal mass, with trace hemorrhage in the surgical bed.
The left parietal 1-cm hyperdense metastasis with small amount of edema is unchanged.
There is no shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
Bone windows demonstrate evidence of left parietal craniotomy.
The paranasal sinuses remain clear, with the exception of opacification of a few right mastoid air cells and a retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus.
Status post resection of the left frontal mass with trace hemorrhagic products in the surgical bed.
No increase in edema and mass effect associated with remaining left parietal metastasis.
Within the surgical resection cavity in the left parietal lobe, there are increased blood products which demonstrate T1-hyperintensity and were also seen on the most recent head CT. No definite residual foci of enhancement are noted post- gadolinium, but somewhat more prominent appearance to the blood products is noted on the post-gadolinium MP-RAGE sequences.
The degree of edema surrounding the resected tumor appears slightly improved from the preoperative examination.
The smaller lesion noted within the posterior left parietal lobe with hemorrhagic component is unchanged and measures approximately 13 x 14 mm, currently.
A suspicious more punctate focus within the right frontal lobe is less conspicuous on today's exam (series 10, image 18).
There is expected new diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement, after surgery.
No new lesion isidentified.
The remaining brain parenchyma is unchanged in appearance with no region of acute infarction.
Status post resection of dominant hemorrhagic left parietal metastatic lesion.
No definite foci suspicious for residual tumor are identified, though evaluation of the superior and posterior aspect of the resection cavity, is somewhat limited by the blood products at this site.
Unchanged appearance to previously-described two other presumed metastatic foci, the larger one, also within the left parietal lobe displays unchanged hemorrhagic component/melanin and internal enhancement.
There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
The gallbladder is normal, with no cholelithiasis seen.
IMPRESSION: Normal gallbladder, with no cholelithiasis as questioned.
Brief Hospital Course: 44M w/PMH for Stg III melanoma admitted to neurosurgery on [**7-19**] for complaint of right arm tingling.
Head CT done and showed two intracranial masses.
Frozen pathology analysis revealed findings consistent with metastatic melanoma.
Post-op MRI revealed gross total resection of the left frontal lesion.
On POD2, he complained of mild abdominal pain.
Labs were sent(including liver and pancreatic enzymes) and revealed a mild pancreatitis with [**Doctor First Name **]/Lip in 400s.
RUQ ultrasound was done, and was negative for obstructive source.
The symptoms resolved subsequently with [**Doctor First Name 674**]/LIP trending toward normal.
The patient's post-operative examination was notable for decreased spatial sensation of his RUE.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Left Frontal Mass Left Parietal Mass Pancreatitis   Discharge Condition: Neurologically Stable   Discharge Instructions: General Instructions/Information  ??????
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**8-12**] days (from your date of surgery) for a wound check.
