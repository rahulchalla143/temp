MRI Cervical, Thoracic, and Lumbar Spine FINDINGS:  There is normal lordotic curvature of the cervical and lumbar as well as kyphotic curvature of the thoracic spine.

No significant degenerative changes are seen involving the thoracic spine.
At L3/L4, there is diffuse disc bulge with superimposed right foraminal protrusion.
The spinal canal is patent, the right neural foramen is mildly narrowed by facet joint osteophytes and disc material.
At L4/L5, there is diffuse disc bulge without spinal canal stenosis.
The bilateral neural foramina are narrowed by facet joint arthropathy, mild on the left and moderate on the right.
At L5/S1, there is loss of disc height with diffuse bulge, but no spinal canal stenosis.
The bilateral neural foramina are narrowed due to facet joint arthropathy and posterior endplate osteophytes, moderate on the right and mild on the left.
There is no abnormal enhancement involving cord, conus, cauda, or meninges.
No evidence of medullary involvement or leptomeningeal spread.
Mild degenerative changes involving the cervical and lumbar spine as detailed above.
Centered within the left thalamus there is a 14 x 9 mm hyperattenuating focal lesion, presumed to be related to the lesion of interest.
In addition a second more linear focus of hyperattenuation is demonstrated within the left temporal subinsular region (2:22) measuring up to 11 mm.
There is associated mass effect with mild rightward shift of normally midline structures by approximately 6 mm.
There is no evidence of acute infarction with preservation of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation.
There is no acute fracture.
IMPRESSION: CT stereotaxis of known hyperattenuating lesion measuring up to 1.4 cm centered within the left thalamus with associated surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect with shift of normally midline structures to the right by 6 mm.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No clinically-significant valvular disease seen.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: FINDINGS:  A small amount of air and hemorrhage along the biopsy tract is stable.
Vasogenic edema surrounding the left thalamic lesion, exerts stable rightward shift of normally midline structures measuring approximately 7 mm.
No new hemorrhage, major vascular territorial infarction, edema, mass or hydrocephalus is noted.
Left frontal pneumocephalus is unchanged.
A left frontal burr hole is again seen.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
IMPRESSION:  Stable post-biopsy changes after biopsy of a left thalamic lesion.
Biopsy tract blood products and associated vasogenic edema are stable.

(1) Likely CNS Lymphoma:  Examination on admission was notable for a mild right facial droop, and mild right arm weakness in an UMN pattern.

Her home verapmil was changed to short acting while inpatient, and she was given dexamethasone and Fioricet PRN with good improvement in her headache.
(3) Nausea:  Patient was given reglan, and zofran for help with nausea emesis.
