Probable enterocutaneous fistula extending from the lower aspect of the anterior abdominal wound through thickened anterior abdominal wall fascia, probably connecting at the site of the ileocolic anastomosis with disrupted appearance of the suture material in this area.
No drainable collection with phlegmonous change in the left lower quadrant anteriorly.
Air and fluid traversing the right lower anterior abdominal wall into the right inguinal canal and scrotum is slightly improved from the previous study, though superinfection would be difficult to exclude.
This is likely just post-surgical change with air from recent Foley catheterization, but correlation with history of instrumentation is recommended.
