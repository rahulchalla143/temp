Admission Date:  [**2194-6-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2194-7-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2128-7-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ceclor  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**] Chief Complaint: Nausea/Vomitting  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Tunnelled catheter placement   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 61512**] is a 65 year-old woman who presented with nausea and vomiting after receiving two cycles of full dose Carboplatinum and Taxol chemotherapy.
She again experienced considerable nausea and vomiting and came to [**Hospital1 18**] EW where she was found to have acute renal failure, hyponatremia and hypochloremia.
Prior to admission she presented with SOB and dyspnea on exertion to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital [**2194-3-25**] where CT showed a 1.5 cm tumor filling the superior pulmonary vein draining the upper and middle lobe on the right.
Extensive workup includig flexible bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy ([**2194-3-28**]) and cervical mediastinoscopy of multiple levels of nodes ([**2194-3-29**]) did not reveal a histologic iagnosis.
She underwent thoracoscopic biopsy of this mass with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] [**2194-4-15**].
As her PFT's showed moderate to severe obstructive ventilatory defect and moderately reduced diffusing capacity as well as the fact that the lung scan showed 40% of her ventiliation and perfusion occur in her right lung, she is considered a non- operable candidate despite the small size of her lesion.
cancer to bone of unknown primary mother: died at age 89 from CAD brothers x 3: healthy  Physical Exam: General: Well appearing woman in no accute distress.
PERRL, EOMI NECK: soft and supple LYMPHADENOPATHY: no cervical, supraclavicular or infraclavicular  lymphadenopathy.
Lungs: decreased breath sounds bilaterally, no wheezes.
Cardiac: RRR S1, S2, no murmurs.
Extrem: No edema Neuro: A+OX3.
no focal neuro deficits.
CT CHEST (7/35): A well-defined pulmonary nodule measuring approximately 10 x 9 mm in the right lower lobe.
Bilateral diffuse emphysema FEMORAL VASCULAR US LEFT ([**6-28**]): Left groin hematoma versus a mostly thrombosed pseudoaneurysm within the left groin, containing a small amount of arterial flow.
No identifiable neck between the common femoral artery and this fluid collection.
CT CONSTRAST W/O CONTRAST ([**6-29**]): Organizing left groin hematoma, without evidence of retroperitoneal extension.
6mm pulmonary nodule at the right lung base; in this patient with known malignancy.
Severe degenerative change and scoliosis of the lumbosacral spine.
No evidence of pseudoaneurysm   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 61512**] is a 65 yo lady with non operable localized NSCLC admitted with nausea/vomiting, ARF and electrolyte abnormalities.
She was transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after development of L groin hematoma and HCT drop after attempts at catheter placement for dialysis.
The hematoma is currently stable, resolving slowly.
Repeat ultrasound showed no pseudoaneysm formation and a stable L groin hematoma.
CT pelvis was performed and showed no sign of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Acute renal failure: Diagnosis of acute tubular necrosis thought to be [**1-1**] to platinum based chemotherapy and pre-renal failure due to dehydration.
She then became oligouric and a test dose of 40 of lasix was given with little urine output.
Non small cell lung cancer: non-operable, currently not receiving any chemo due to complicated hospital course.
Constipation: likely due to prolonged bed rest.
Nausea/Vomitting: Thought to be multifactorial, causes include ARF and prior chemotherapy treatment.
Hyponatremia: Thought to be secondary to salt wasting nephropathy.
She was then converted to 2amp bicarb/1/2NS to address both the hyponatremia and metabolic acidosis, with clinical signs of fluid overload, and little urine output she was discontinued from IVF.
