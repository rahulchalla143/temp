About 4-5 months ago, she began to develop dyspnea on exertion and intermittent bilateral leg swelling.
She also started to have tooth bleeding and swelling, and has had 4-5 visits to her dentist in the last several months for recurrent tooth infections.
She also describes intermittent pain on the lower right side of her chest and RUQ with exertion that improves with rest.
Last episode was earlier today but currently she denies SOB or chest pain.

[**5-11**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[**5-12**] ECHO: Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional left ventricular systolic function.
No CT evidence of acute pulmonary embolism.
Smooth interlobular septal thickening, likely due to interstitial edema.
Mild lower lobe bronchiectasis and mucoid impaction.
Although  nonspecific, this raises the possibility of chronic aspiration.
No substantial pleural or pericardial effusion.
[**5-29**] LE U/S: IMPRESSION:  Normal Doppler ultrasound of both lower extremities, no evidence for DVT.
[**6-8**] CXR: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process within the limitation of the chest radiograph is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 year old female with h/o HTN, HL, and multiple recent tooth infections who presents with pancytopenia, dyspnea, bilateral leg swelling, and BRBPR, found to have promyelocytic leukemia on BM biopsy with course complicated by coagulopathy.
Promyelocytic leukemia:  Constellation of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia with inappropriately low reticulocytosis was consistent with bone marrow pathology.
Biopsy confirmed promyelocytic leukemia.
Her counts had an initial recovery but then a prolonged nadir after treatment.
# Neutropenic fever: Febrile to 100.8 on HD1 in context of receiving transfusion, and was intermittantly febrile throughout her course after chemotherapy treatment.
Urine initially grew out ESBL and Enterococcus, and she was treated with meropenem and defervesced.
Bright Red Blood Per Rectum:  Had reports of BRBPR and seen to have small amount of BRBPR in the ED.
Most likely lower GI bleed in the setting of thrombocytopenia and DIC.
Dyspnea and Chest pain: Felt her dyspnea and overall fatigue was likely related to her profound anemia given that it subacutely developed over the course of several months.
Most consistent with demand ischemia in the setting of anemia.
# Episodes of 'throat tightening': After starting ATRA, the patient had episodes of feeling like her throat had tightened.
She was never hypoxic during these episodes and had no stridor on exam.
She was initially treated with steroids for concern for ATRA syndrome but when she developed no further symptoms it was felt that this was instead likely anxiety.
Lower extremity edema:  Does have report of bilateral lower extremity edema over the last several weeks.
Does have elevated d-dimer and likely at risk for thrombosis.
Did have mildly elevated JVP and some dyspnea that could be related to CHF as well, although no signs of left-sided CHF and feel this is less likely.
# Elevated AST/ALT: Following admission, patient developed mild elevation of AST and ALT likely related to chemotherapy.
# TB prophylaxis: Patient with a history of TB exposure and negative chest xray.
# HTN:  Normotensive.

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis Acute Promyelocytic leukemia.
Secondary Diagnosis Pancytopenia Neutropenic Fever   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with low blood counts, and a bone marrow biopsy showed that you have Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia.
Given your history of tuberculosis exposure, we recommend that you follow up with the infectious diseases clinic, we have made an appointment for you.
