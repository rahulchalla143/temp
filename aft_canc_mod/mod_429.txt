Admission Date:  [**2189-2-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2189-2-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2107-8-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**] Chief Complaint: hematuria  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: continuous bladder irrigation  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 12236**] is an 81 year old gentleman with a history of prostate cancer in remission, COPD, HTN, abestosis, dementia, likely malignant pulmonary nodule who initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2-10**] after 1 day of urinary incontinence and gross hematuria at home.
He was found to have ARF with a Cr of 1.7 (from BL 1.0), and BUN in 50s.
He was found to have frank blood clots in his urine and was started on CBI.
Urology consulted and thought c/w radiation cystitis.
While in the ED he had ~ 400 mL of coffee ground emesis although NG lavage returned on scant amounts of coffee grounds.
He had no melena or maroon stools while in the MICU but continued to have large amounts of blood on CBI.
He has remained hemodynamically stable with normal blood pressure and no tachycardia.
Currently, patient is without complaint.
He does recall feeling nauseous with episode of hematemesis.
Otherwise without complaints.
Past Medical History: # COPD # HTN # Asbestosis # Pulmonary nodule, ?
malignant - spiculated, RUL - followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2168**] - No further work-up currently due to high risks of biopsy and potential treatment # Prostate cancer - [**Doctor Last Name **] [**8-31**], T2a - s/p XRT and neoadjuvant chemotherapy, hormonal therapy - now in remission for ~ 10 years # Larynx tumor - approximately 10 years ago - reportedly benign # Cataract in R eye # dementia, multi-infarct # Macular degeneration # h/o colon polyps # h/o neck cyst removal [**2179**] # hearing loss # h/o lumbar compression fracture   Social History: Patient lives with his son, who is bipolar.
Moving all extremities GU: Three way foley in place draining red urine without clots  Pertinent Results: [**2-11**] renal u/s: 1.
Mild left renal hydronephrosis.
Echogenic material within the urinary bladder presumed to be blood clot.
History of hematuria is provided.
No definite etiology for hematuria is identified and MRI could be helpful for further evaluation.
[**2-10**] CXR: In comparison with study of [**2188-8-11**], there is again hyperexpansion of the lungs with coarseness of interstitial markings consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.
Pleural calcification is again consistent with asbestos-related disorder.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 year old male with a history of prostate cancer in remission, COPD, HTN, abestosis, dementia, and presumed malignant pulmonary nodule here with hematuria, ARF, leukocytosis, and coffee ground emesis.
# Coffee ground emesis: Patient had initial Hct drop although he had no recurrent hematemesis.
He underwent upper endoscopy which revealed an ulcer at the GE junction with clot but no evidence of active bleeding.
His diet was advanced following EGD without issue.
Patient had persitent hematuria with clots despite multiple days of CBI.
A CTU was obtained which showed nonspecific bladder wall thickening but was otherwise unremarkable.
It was recommended that he have outpatient cystoscopy performed.
He was continued on oxybutynin with foley in place to prevent spasm but that was stopped once CBI discontinued to prevent urinary retention.
He was treated with a 7 day course of cipro for possible UTI although it was never clear that he had active infection in his urine.
Initially concern for obstructive pathology given clots and hematuria but renal u/s showed only unlateral hydronephrosis.
Thought to be most likely pre-renal ARF due to acute GI bleed which resolved to IVF and blood transfusions.
He had a CTU performed which showed renal cysts without other abnormality.
No other obvious source of infection outside GU tract.
CXR without obvious infiltrate although known lung nodule could predispose to pneumonia or superinfection.
Could also be stress response in the setting of GU and GI processes.
# COPD: no spirometry in our system but severe emphysema on CT chest 10/[**2188**].
# htn: normotensive in setting of GIB and verapamil and lisinopril held.
Lisinopril was restarted without change in creatinine and improvement in hypertensive episodes .
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
