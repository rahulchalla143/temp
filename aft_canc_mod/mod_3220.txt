Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracentesis - complicated by small left apical pneumothorax.
History of Present Illness: 76 F with HTN, severe AS, Afib, hypothyroidism, right-sided pleural effusion and bilateral adnexal cystic structures found on CT ([**4-/2198**]) who is transfered back to the floor from MICU after thoracentesis.
Patient was initially transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for question of mesenteric ischemia.
She initially presented to [**Hospital1 1474**] on [**9-17**] after sudden onset, severe abdominal pain with loose, yellowish stool that occured the night before presentation.
She was diagnosed with bronchitis and given a course of abx (?
Shortly after starting to take the abx, pt developed severe [**11-6**] epigastric pain @2AM unable to sleep, then presented AM of [**9-16**] to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital.
Per report she also experience episodes of dizziness and at least 1 episode of losing consciousness, falling, and hitting the back of her head.
In regards to her abdominal pain, the patient stated that it was different from abdominal bloating in past.
She reported sense of burning along with two episodes of loose yellow stools preceding her admission along with dry heaves but no vomiting.
[**Doctor Last Name **] waves on her ekg, acidemic with PH of 7.1 and a lactate exceeding measurable limit; Given her abd pain, acidemia, and lactic acidosis, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible mesenteric ischemia.
RUQ U/S demonstrates cholelithiasis, but no cholecystitis.
Surgery saw pt in ED and but did not think she had mesenteric ischemia.
- pt notes abd bloating and abd tightness in band like pattern around waist X 1 year.
- Fatigue is unchanged over the entire day - not worse at the end of the day.- No outdoor exposures or cold exposure.
- difficulty swallowing pills X years - Weight loss of 25 lbs over 6-7 months - Decreased appetite - has globus sensation with solid foods.
No vision changes.
No myxedema, rashes.
- Notes micrographia over the last year.
Past Medical History: -AFib -severe aortic stenosis (ao valve area 1.0) -HTN -GERD -rising CA-125 and persistent bilateral adnexal cystic structures - seen by OB/GYN recently -> CT of the abdomen and pelvis, which was performed at [**Location (un) 5164**] on [**2198-5-16**].
This revealed a new left-sided pleural effusion, which was described as moderate.
There was no abdominal mass or ascites.
Per GYN note, recommended further eval of R sided pleural effusion w/ thoracentesis -> per pt, had fluid aspirated and was fine -Fallopian tube polyp -thyroid nodules -tonsillectomy -D+C -cholesterol embolus to her eye -peripheral neuropathy -degenerative joint disease -bilateral pleural effusions over the past 3-4 months, apparently s/p thoracentesis at OSH, reportedly negative for malignancy.
133/68 67 20 96%2L 1100/855  I: 1100cc/O: UOP 855cc past 8hrs GENERAL: severely slow and lethargic HEENT: Unable to sustain upward gaze more than 10s.
PERRL, EOMI, OMMM, no erythema or exudates.
NECK: No thyroid nodules, JVP 10cm, no bruits.
CARDIOVASCULAR: S1, absent S2, III/VI systolic LSB, some radiation to carotids LUNGS: clear to auscultation ABDOMEN: Hyperactive bowel sounds, slightly obese, neg [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign.
No TTP, no guarding, no rebound.

PELVIS U.S., TRANSVAGINAL  [**2198-9-19**] 1:15 PM  IMPRESSION: 5.1-cm complex cystic mass, concerning for left ovarian neoplasm.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2198-9-16**] 3:27 PM  IMPRESSION: There are bilateral pleural effusions, with associated adjacent bibasilar opacity.
While some of this may represent adjacent atelectasis, the left retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis and/or consolidation, and clinical correlation is recommended.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2198-9-16**] 3:27 PM Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There is severe aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 76F admitted with hypothermia, resolving multisystem failure of unclear etiology in the setting of reported ovarian cyst, severe abdominal pain and one year of slowing, lethargy.
* Abdominal Pain: Abd CT did not reveal any intraabdominal pathology other than pelvic mass.
pt with chronic bloating sensation and vague abd pain.
Serial abd exams.
* Ovarian mass: pt's history of 25lb weight loss over past 6 months suspicious for cancer; also elevated CA 125 (152U/ML:normal range 0-35).
Pelvic US shows complex mass concerning for ovarian neoplasm; GYN-ONC following.
* AS/MR: echo shows AS with valve area 0.6 cm2 and mixed AR, 2+ MR, 2+ TR, hyperdynamic LVEF in setting of MR.   * Renal failure: returned to 0.7.
* Elevated CA 125: has been evaluated by Gyn as outpatient but no explanation of CA 125 found as yet.
* Pleural effusions: Pt unable to tell us what the etiology of her effusion has been despite previous thoracentesis ([**8-2**]).
There was a question of Meig's Syndrome, given pt also with elevated CA 125, ovarian mass, though this effusion is bilateral.
* Towards the end of her stay it was noted that the patient had a gait disturbance.
At first she simply refused to walk and then when she did try it was noted that she had an unstable, slow and shuffling gait.
* Ultimately the patient stablized without any specific interventions.
At this point the patient should have had a biopsy of the pelvic mass.
The patient was discharged with specific instructions to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**] regarding her aortic stenosis and determining her fitness for a procedure to biopsy the mass in her pelvis.
