Admission Date:  [**2135-10-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2135-11-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2078-5-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2195**] Chief Complaint: chills, hypoxic episode, fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 57 yo M with h/o metastatic prostate cancer presents after episode of chills and acute SOB.
Patient was dx with prostate cancer 5 yrs ago on routine screening.
He had recurrence about 1 year ago, now with known liver and bone met's.
Of note, he started an estrogen based chemotherapy (Estramustine) on Wed. of last week with concurrent coumadin for possible hypercoagulable state.
Patient had been at baseline prior to 1 day PTA when he describes first feeling very cold and then developing severe SOB after walking to bathroom.
Denies any cough or hemoptysis.
Also had hemorrhoidal bleeding 1 month ago and was admitted for endoscopy.
flash pulmonary edema as he was on lasix at home.
Initial CXR was unimpressive, CTA was a suboptimal study but no large central PE.
Noted to have guaiac positive red stool in ED and one episode of hemoptysis.
Given obstructive pattern on LFTs, got non-con CT abd with no obvious obstruction, only a multinodular liver.
On interview in the MICU, patient endorses sharp R subcostal pain this AM, but states that it occurs when he misses his neurontin and it has not recurred since.
He currently denies any SOB or CP, is comfortable on room air.
Past Medical History: Hypertension gout right shoulder fracture, history of chlamydia and gonorrhea prostate CA with mets to bone, liver and spine, status post prostatectomy with Lupron injection umbilical hernia status post arthroscopy of the knee.
hemorrhoidectomy, with hx of anal fissures Recent lower GIB with negative [**Last Name (un) **] and EGD Depression/Anxiety  Social History: lives with wife, has children and step-children.
No tobacco or EtOH.
Family History: sister with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] CA  Physical Exam: GEN: obese, NAD HEENT: MMM, JVP not visible due to body habitus CV: tachy, no m/r/g PULM: CTAB AB: positive BS, NT/ND, no HSM EXT: 1+ non-pitting pedal edema to shins NEURO: CN II-XII intact (q/o L facial droop but resolves with smiling), strength 5/5 throughout, sensation intact, reflexes 1+ throughout.
ST-T wave changes are non-specific.
Low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.
Widened mediastinum, which could in part be due to low lung volumes and AP technique.
However, if clinical concern for acute aortic syndrome, recommend chest CTA for further evaluation.
Hilar prominence may be due to vascular engorgement.
Subtle opacities in both lung fields may be due to edema, infection and/or metastases.
Bilateral, right greater than left pleural thickening versus less likely effusions.
Suboptimal evaluation for pulmonary embolus, as above, although no large, central embolus identified.
Extensive osseous metastatic disease due to prostate cancer.
Central interstitial thickening in upper lobes may be due to pulmonary edema, but given fever, also consider infectious source.
Due to history of malignancy, malignant component is also possible.
No evidence of central pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection, but limited study due to timing of contrast and motion.
New peripancreatic fat stranding.
Clinical correlation for acute pancreatitis is recommended.
Pulmonary edema vs atypical pneumonia, slightly improved.
Multiple pulmonary nodular opacities are incompletely evaluated on the background of ground-glass opacity and a followup chest CT after the acute pulmonary process resolves is recommended on an outpatient.
1.6-cm mediastinal lymph node, which may also be reassessed at the time of follow up CT. 5.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No evidence of colitis or acute abdominal process.
vertebral body destruction.
RUQ U/S: Innumerable echogenic masses throughout the liver without biliary ductal dilatation.
This is an unusual pattern for metastatic prostate cancer, and if appropriate, biopsy can be considered.
LENIS No deep venous thrombosis identified in the lower extremities bilaterally.
Of note, the right common femoral vein was not interrogated due to overlying dressing.
No evidence of hemorrhage, edema or mass effect.
No acute fractures are identified.
Soft tissue swelling is noted over the left parieto-occipital region.
vancomycin trough [**11-6**]: 18.5  Brief Hospital Course: 57 yo M with metastatic prostate cancer (bone, liver mets) presents with episode of hypoxia and tachycardia, fever after starting estrogen-based therapy.
HYPOXIA/TACHYCARDIA/FEVER: Patient's initial presentation with acute dyspnea, hypoxia and tachycardia concerning for PE, especially in setting of pro-coagulable state on estrogen-chemotherapy.
Patient underwent CTA which was non-diagnostic due to respiration artifact and poor contrast timing.
There was no e/o RV strain on EKG or TTE.
LENIS were negative for DVT.
Patient was admitted to MICU, where he was treated empirically for PE with heparin gtt.
Infection was also on the differential given high fever to 104 after presentation to the ED and CT chest showed upper lobe infiltrates.
Patient will need repeat chest CT once infection resolves ([**2-21**] weeks) to rule out underlying malignancy.
However, INR became supratherapeutic, likely because of interaction with levaquin, and coumadin was held, vitamin K given.
He will therefore be treated with a HAP course (10 days of vancomycin and cefepime, 5 days of Levaquin) with 4 additional days of vancomycin for bacteremia (14 days total).
Patient remained afebrile after receiving initial abx on HD# 1. .
Had intermittent hemorrhoidal bleeding and epistaxis/hemoptysis [**12-20**] anticoagulation and thrombocytopenia.
No evidence of significant GI bleeding.
No e/o hemolysis.
Likely [**12-20**] baseline anemia due to bone marrow replacement by cancer, with minimal acute bleeding.
HYPOTENSION: Patient was hypotensive in ED, but stabilized with antibiotics and fluids.
PROSTATE CA: Patient has prostate cancer with met's to liver, bone.
Patient had signs of worsening widespread disease, including worsening LFTs elevation, tachycardia, and decreased alertness.
TRANSAMINITIS: LFTs increased likely [**12-20**] met's, although there were no hepatitis serologies in our system so these were repeated.
LOWER EXTREMITY EDEMA: Patient developed LE edema on HD# 2, likely due to high dose steroids and fluid resusitation.
Patient had no evidence of CHF on TTE, and patient appeared otherwise euvolemic.
TACHYCARDIA: Patient remained tachycardic 100-120s despite adequate hydration and no other signs of uncontrolled infection.
Tachycardia was attributed to underlying malignancy, since heart rate seemed to increase with increase in LFT's, indicative of worsening disease.
Telemetry and EKGs showed sinus tachycardia.
He also had one episode atrial tachycardia vs. AVNRT on [**11-6**], which lasted <3 seconds and was asymptomatic and did not recur so was not treated.
Depression/anxiety: Patient became extremely fatigued and remained largely inactive.
Unclear if this was due to worsening underlying illness vs. depression.
