Admission Date:  [**2125-4-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2125-5-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-10-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5037**] Chief Complaint: Seizure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Head CT Brain MRI Abdominal MRI Renal MRI/MRA EEG pMIBI Resection of abdominal mass  History of Present Illness: 57F with PMH significant for h/o T2DM, s/p renal transplant [**2122**] on immunosuppressants (Tacrolimus, prednisone and azathioprine), who presents to the ED with occipital headache x 2 weeks.
Neurology was consulted, and witnessed her eyes beating to the left rhythmically, with eyelids fluttering with the beating nystagmus.
She was noted to be unresponsive to pain or voice during this event, which lasted for approximately 3 minutes.
She was noted to have a left sided pronator drift and an inability to raise left leg to gravity.
Non-contrast head CT done before her seizure demonstrated possible low attenuation within the white matter of the left occipital lobe and within the right occipital lobe to a lesser extent.
There were also foci of low attenuation within the subcortical white matter within the right frontal hemisphere.
A second noncontrast head CT was done after the episode that demonstrated no interval change.
LP demonstrated 1 wbc, prot 47, gluc 97, no oligoclonal bands.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 36061**] and her husband deny any past h/o seizure, stroke or infection of the brain.
She has had decreased PO intake recently and had an admission for diarhea and metabolic acidosis recently.
Several med changes were instituted at that time: Cellcept 500mg [**Hospital1 **] was switched to azathioprine 100mg qD, epogen decreased from 3 x per week to 2 x per week due to painful injections, Crestor restarted at 20mg qD, and Lasix started at 40mg PO qD for elevated BP.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 36061**] was admitted to the Neuro ICU for hypertensive emergency, and was monitored overnight, with no events.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: T: 97.9F  BP: 150/41  HR: 62  RR: 27  SaO2: 96% 4L NC GEN: Lying in bed comfortably, NAD HEENT: NC/AT, anicteric sclera, MMM, PERRL NECK: supple, no meningismus, no LAD CHEST: CTAB, no w/r/r, poor inspiratory effort CV: RRR, nl S1 and S2, no m/r/g ABD: soft, NT/ND, mildly tender over site of orthotopic kidney, which pt states is chronically present, +BS throughout EXTREM: no LE edema, thrill left forearm NEURO: A&Ox3, but answering questions slowly CN intact no pronator drift, strength 5-/5 bilaterally.
Bone Scan [**2125-5-7**]: IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of osseous metastatic disease.
4) Diffuse increase in bilateral leg soft tissue uptake, may reflect poor renal function or vascular disease.
Stress test: Impression: No anginal symptoms or ischemic EKG changes.
Mibi IMPRESSION: No myocardial perfusion defects identified.
Abd US: IMPRESSION: Following extensive evaluation of the left upper quadrant heterogeneous mass, it is felt that it likely represents an exophytic hepatic lesion arising from segment II.
Liver pool blood study: IMPRESSION: Large splenic/perisplenic mass is not consistent with a cavernous hemangioma or splenule.
Tortuous transplant renal artery with multiple 90-degree turns with folds giving apparent mild narrowing to the transplant renal artery.
Distal folding gives narrowing that approaches but is less than 50%.
Small renal transplant upper pole defect likely from prior biopsy.
No concerning lesion within the transplant kidney or perirenal fluid collections.
Right native renal artery stenosis approaching 50%.
Left upper quadrant mass likely splenic in origin, not completely characterized.
While a splenic hemangioma is statistically most likely, this is uncertain.
Comparison with remote prior films would be best, but if not available, a tagged red cell nuclear medicine study or biopsy is recommended.
Multiple small pancreatic cystic lesions raise the question of side branch IPMT.
Suspicion for proximal right renal artery stenosis in the native kidney, incompletely evaluated on this study.
Otherwise no diastolic flow is identified in the upper or mid poles.
Echo: Conclusions: 1.The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
4.The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
7.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brain MRI: IMPRESSION: Findings on MRI of the brain is consistent with the clinical history of hypertensive encephalopathy, with edema visualized within the white matter of primarily the posterior portions of the brain.
There are no diffusion signal abnormalities to indicate infarction.
MR [**First Name (Titles) 36062**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4059**] patency of the major intracranial veins.
CT head: IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage.
Foci of low attenuation within the subcortical white matter as described above, could be small vessel ischemic change.
If further evaluation is warranted, an MRI should be performed  Brief Hospital Course: 1) Hypertensive emergency/Seizure: Mrs. [**Known lastname 36061**] had brain MRI/A/V that was consistent with occipital lobe leukoencephalopathy [**2-22**] hypertension.
Her Prograf was also d/c'ed for potential contribution to this condition.
EEG was read as abnormal for slowed bilateral posterior background rhythms, c/w encephalopathy.
Her mental status and neurological exam quickly returned to baseline, and her BP meds were titrated for optimal BP control.
She had no further seizures or hypertensive episodes.
She also had a renal MRI/A of her native and graft kidney to assess for RAS as a secondary cause of her worsening HTN.
Her native kidney RA had evidence of atherosclerotic 50% lesion.
2) Possible lymphangioleiomyomatosis: After transfer to medical floor, it was observed that Mrs. [**Known lastname 36061**] had a persistent O2 requirement.
CXR demonstrated an interstitial process with some suggestion of cystic disease.
Pulmonary service was consulted, and a chest CT was done, which demonstrated diffuse thin-walled parencymal cysts which, in a female non-smoker, was thought to be most consistent with pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, although there were features that were not consistent.
PFTs were also done, demonstrating a mild obstructive pattern, which was similar to OSH PFTs from [**2123**], and significantly worse than OSH PFTs from [**2117**].
Attempts were made to determine if slides were done of lung parenchyma from her previous thoracotomy.
3) Abdominal mass: On the abdominal cuts from Mrs.[**Known lastname 36063**] chest CT, a large, 8cm heterogeneous mass was seen anterior and superior to the spleen.
A dedicated MRI was done of the lesion, which confirmed thin-walled septa and hypoattenuating nodules within the mass, which was thought to be associated with the spleen.
A tagged rbc scan was done, which confirmed that the mass was not a splenule or hemangioma.
It was thought that this mass was likely HCC given the location as well as the mildly elevated AFP.
A pMIBI was done as part of a cardiac w/u, which demonstrated no evidence of ischemia.
4) Renal failure: As mentioned, tacrolimus was held in the setting of leukoencephalopathy.
There was a suspicion that her hypertensive episode could have damaged her graft kidney, or that she could have RAS which caused the original hypertensive episode.
An renal MRI/A of her graft and native kidney demonstrated 50% RAS of her native RA, but no significant occlusion of her graft RA other than that induced by folding of the RA.
She was intermittently on lasix for lung crackles and increased LE edema.
The assessment by the renal team was that this was likely chronic allograft nephropathy.
7) Prophylaxis - Maintained on subcutaneous hepatin, pantoprazole, bowel regimen .
