last vL >580k ([**2168-6-13**], genotype 1) - Grade 2 esophageal varicies + portal hypertensive gastropathy ([**6-19**]) - Ascites - Hepatic encephalopathy - AFP 140, hepatic lesions concerning for hepatoma # Psoriasis # s/p TAH for uterine CA # Diverticulosis   Social History: Quit smoking 8 years ago (40 pack year history).
Used occasional amphetamines from [**2163**]-[**2165**] while she was in a graduate program for literature at the MFA.

She was transferred to the MICU with concern for early sepsis.
She had a diagnostic paracentesis that was negative for SBP and CXR negative for PNA.
She was also found to have ARF with Cr of 1.5 at admission, up from 1 on [**2-17**] (had been 1.8 on [**2-16**]).
She was given diltiazem, with brief drop in her pressures to the 60s systolic.
She was also found to have acute renal failure and has been treated with albumin.
No evidence of SBP.
She was seen by psychiatry for her depression and was started on citalopram and methlylphenidate per their recommendations.
Pt's diuretics were held on the floor due to progressively worsening hyponatremia with a nadir of 113, she was asymptomatic.
Her hyponatremia was believed to be a mixed picture of pre-renal and cirrhotic physiology.
Her renal failure continued to worsen with a peak creatinine of 2.8, minimally responsive to fluids, treated with albumin, midodrine and octreotide.
She also continued to have low temperatures, with a nadir of 92 on the floor, at which point she was pan cultured, with no growth, treated with bair hugger.
On evening of [**3-7**] she became hypotensive to SBP 70s, she was having guaiac positive brown stool with some visible clots and an acute HCT from from 23 to 17 in the setting of receiving 1 unit PRBCs.
She underwent a cordis placement, immediate transfusion with several units of PRBC, FFP and saline due to hypotension.
EGD showed bleeding varices which was cauterized.
She was more acidotic, on pressors, hypothermic and continued hematemesis and melena.
# Hepatitis C cirrhosis: Has been complicated by encephalopathy, varices, ascites HCC.
continued lactulose & rifaximin, held diuretics d/t hyponatremia wich worsened today and ARF.
As noted above progressive decline with GIB.
worsening decline with GIB as noted above, severe metabolic acidosis in MICU, ?
No hemofiltration initiated.
# psych: pt with depressive presentation.
Increased somnolence with worsening clinical picture, encephalopathic and obtundation with GIB in MICU.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Had episode of atrial fibrillation in MICU and has no previous history of afib, but h/o atrial tachycardia for which she is on BB as outpt.
Could be d/t recent infection, dehydration.
no episodes of AF in MICU.
# Anemia and thrombocytopenia: Has h/o gastropathy seen on EGD in [**6-19**] and occasionally transfused.
Exsanguination as above due to coagulopathy and liver failure.
# Hypothermia: Improved.
Pt currently hemodynamically stable and no longer hypothermic.
No asterixis on exam.
Could have been precipitated by infection and possibly d/t missing a dose of lactulose at rehab.
Treated infection as possible source, worsening liver disease and active GIB.
# Hyponatremia: Pt's hyponatremia improved since last admission but worsened again last night.
At that time diuretics were stopped due to ongoing hyponatremia.
