There was concern for poor liver function; ABD ultrasound on POD1 showed "Patent transplant hepatic vessels.
Low resistive indices in hepatic arteries.
Fluid collection posterior to liver, most likely hematoma, but fluid-debris level could represent bile leak."
LFT's trended down, and coagulation studies were only moderately abnormal.
Labs gradually improved, with LFT's trending down.
He had increased drainage from his incision on POD7 ([**6-14**]); CT scan was unremarkable with no changes.
On [**6-16**], an ostomy appliance was applied around the wound to help control drainage due to ascitic leak.
On [**6-19**], a hepatic arteriogram demonstrated mild narrowing at the hepatic artery anastomosis with interval improvement since the last study, however the portal vein could not be visulaized.
The following day, an ultrasound demonstrated abnormal arterial, hepatic venous and portal flows, essentially unchanged, however the proximal portal vein was not clearly appreciated.
On [**6-21**], a CTA demonstrated a thrombosis of the donor portal vein extending to the iliac vein anastomosis.
He was immediately taken back to the OR for an exploratory laparotomy, portal vein thrombectomy, portal venous revision with Hemashield patch angioplasty, and excision of common bile duct and liver biopsy (subsequently showing subfulminant hepatic necrosis).
He was transferred to the SICU intubated and sedated with an open abdomen and on a heparin drip with a goal PTT greater than 50.
An Angio  was done to assess for residual clot in the PV.
Angio demonstrated a nonocclusive intraluminal filling defect in the main portal vein, likely thrombus in the vicinity of the presumed anastomosis.
The following day, he was taken to IR again and an angiogram demonstrated sluggish right main portal vein flow with multiple filling defects suggestive of thrombosis, which contributed to inability to pass the guidewire into central location.
An ultrasoud showed persistent nonocclusive thrombus in the portal vein.
A portogram demonstrated two areas of nonocclusive thrombus (SMV/iliac anastomosis and at the right/left bifurcation) as well as multiple narrow areas of possible stenosis, most significant at the SMV/iliac graft anastomosis.
A follow-up angiogram showed improving but persistent nonocclusive thrombus in the portal vein.
Drains outputs were 975cc and 1500cc of ascitic fluid.
An ultrasound demonstrated a non-occlusive intraluminal filling defect in the main portal vein with likely thrombus in the vicinity of the anastomosis.
An angiogram demonstrated no significant interval change in the size of the nonocclusive thrombi and TPA was continued.
At that time, he had a Roux-en-Y pedicle jejunostomy, right and left liver biopsy and abdominal wall closure.
Due to significant intraoperative mesenteric and bowel swelling, the biliary anastamosis had not been completed the last time he was in the OR.
On POD 1 he spiked a fever to 101 and was pan-cultured, but these cultures were negative.
The ascitic leak was replaced with albumin.
Lasix was increased to 80 for fluid retention.
On [**7-5**], HARRT medications were stopped due to elevated Prograf levels greater than 30.
On [**7-7**] he complained of increasing abd pain, hot flashes, nausea and vomited undigested food.
Abd discomfort resolved.
KUB showed dilated bowel with air fluid levels.
He required tapering of pm dosage due to am hypoglycemia on several days.
Azithromycin was started for CD4 count less than 50 for MAC prophylaxis.
A hypoechoic area in the right hepatic lobe was unchanged.
Splenomegaly and a small amount of ascites were unchanged.
