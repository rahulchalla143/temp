Unable to obtain full history as patient intubated/sedated, but per OMR and family, the patient had pyloric to duodenal stent placement [**2123-3-18**], had recent neck/upper chest radiation x 3 weeks, and OSH admission for transfusions for melena and GIB.
He was having increased post-prandial vomiting x 1 week at home, escalating to 10-15 episodes/day.
Also with increased SOB requiring 2-3L NC O2 intermittently at home.
On EGD, malignant intrinsic mass was seen in the pylorus extending into duodenum within the prior metal stent.
Two additional pyloric to duodenal stents were successfully placed within prior stents with no procedural complications.
After the procedure, patient had post procedure aspiration CXR showing evidence of aspiration.
Past Medical History: -Recurrent esophageal CA s/p esophagectomy s/p gastric pull and pyloric to duodenal stent placement [**2123-3-18**], s/p prior biliary stents for CBD and intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation -Ulcerative colitis with no recent flares -Coronary artery disease s/p MI [**31**] yrs ago - no ECHO in system, per family no known history of heart failure.
No ETOH, IVDU.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
There is no pneumothorax.
There is significant interval worsening of multiple bilateral patchy parenchymal opacities, consistent with multifocal aspiration pneumonia.
There is an apparent rightward shift of the mid esophagus, likely a combined effect of prior post-surgical changes and new post-procedural esophageal dilatation.
There is a new gastric outlet stent, and a TIPS stent.
IMPRESSION: Significant interval worsening with multiple bilateral patchy opacities consistent with multifocal aspiration pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 72M with recurrent esophageal CA with mets s/p esophagectomy s/p gastric pull through and pyloric to duodenal stent placement [**2123-3-18**] admitted to MICU for closer monitoring with extubation s/p intubation for successful placement of overlapping pyloric-duodenal stents by GI and possible aspiration PNA.
Respiratory failure: The patient not extubated in the PACU given concern for tenuous pre-procedure respiratory status and evidence for aspiration on post-procedure CXR.
Per his family he had increased O2 requirement even prior to procedure.
He likely has aspiration PNA as well as a component of fluid overload given his LE edema.
Gastric outlet syndrome s/p new overlapping stent placement in pylorus to duodenum: Per ERCP fellow and procedure report there were no complications to procedure.
On EGD a malignant intrinsic mass was seen in the pylorus extending into duodenum within the prior metal stent.
# Hyponatremia:  The patient was in hypervolemic hyponatremia likely due to acute renal failure.
# Recurrent esophageal cancer with multiple complications: The patient's goals were clearly palliation and it was confirmed with the family who were at the bedside.
# PPX: DVT ppx with SC heparin and a bowel regimen of senna and colace.
Disp:*21 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital3 **] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Recurrent Esophageal cancer Intractable Nausea s/p multiple stents   Discharge Condition: Satting 93% on 4L nasal canula.
However, it is likely you aspirated some vomitted material into your lungs around the time of the procedure.
Please call your oncologist or the hospice nurse if you have any further questions or concerns.
