The patient has a history of colon cancer s/p colostomy and she has reported seeing maroon stool in the colostomy bag.
Labs drawn at the nursing home [**Last Name (un) **] dplatelet count of 6 so given the constellation of symptoms she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
Labs were notable for neutropenia, a platelet count of 7 , and a hematocrit of 18 fropm baseline 24. head CT was significant for a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
She went into atrial fibrillation with rates to 120's while in the ED as well.
Of note, she was recently discharged on [**3-31**] after being hospitalized for pseudomonas sepsis and GI bleeding.
Past Medical History: Colon cancer [**2099**] s/p diverting colostomy reversed [**2100**], loop colostomy for large bowel obstruction [**10-25**] Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma diagnosed [**10/2103**] Aplastic anemia Hypertension Iron overload (heterozygous for hemochromatosis gene) h/o C. diff colitis h/o large bowel obstruction s/p appendectomy s/p tonsillectomy s/p tubal ligation s/p cholecystectomy  Social History: Widow, has five children Lives alone in [**Name (NI) 16843**], MA - son has been staying with her recently Denies tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use   Family History: Father died of stroke at age 77 Mother had CAD and renal failure No family history of malignancy or hematologic disorder  Physical Exam: Vitals: T:98.6 BP:146/74 P:99 R: 18 O2: 100% 1.5L General: Alert, oriented X3, no acute distress, pale HEENT: Sclera anicteric, mucus membranes dry.
lips with crusted blood Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, colostomy on LLQ draining maroon stool GU: no foley Ext: 1+ edema with scattered purpura.
SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON REQUEST..          OF TWO COLONIAL MORPHOLOGIES.
Anaerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2106-4-6**]):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN CLUSTERS.
CT Head [**4-5**]: FINDINGS: There is a 6 x 6-mm new round hyperdense focus at the right cranial vertex (2:26) concerning for acute hemorrhage.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage elsewhere, infarction, mass effect, or edema.
Age-appropriate prominence of ventricles and sulci is consistent with diffuse parenchymal volume loss, not significantly changed from prior.
Subcortical and periventricular white matter hyperdensity is consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
No osseous abnormality is identified.
IMPRESSION: New 6-mm hyperdense focus in right posterior frontal vertex, concerning for acute hemorrhage.
CT Head [**4-6**]: FINDINGS: A small focal hyperdensity at the right posterior vertex, most likely intraaxial, is unchanged in size and configuration, measuring 6 mm x 6 mm (2:24), without evidence of significant mass effect or edema.
There is no new intracranial hemorrhage.
The ventricles and cerebral sulci remain prominent, consistent with diffuse parenchymal volume loss.
Subcortical and periventricular regions of hypoattenuation are consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease, is unchanged.
No new intracranial hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: Acute Blood Loss Anemia/GI Bleed: The cause of the bleed was due to missed transfusion of platelets.
Her goal Hct is >25 for symptomatic support.
She did not have significant neurological deficitis.
Lymphoblastic Lymphoma/Transfusion dependend pancytopenia: She remained neutropenic and transfusion dependent.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid response:  Asymptomatic.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) **] Nursing & Rehabilitation Center - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute blood loss anemia/GI bleed Pancytopenia, transfusion dependent Lymphoblastic lymphoma Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Neutropenia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Patient was admitted with GI bleeding due to a very low platelet count.
She was also found to have a right frontal brain hemorrhage as well.
With transfusion her bleeding stopped and her brain hemorrhage was stable.
No further episodes of bleeding occurred.
She also had episodes of rapid afib.
She had a contaminated blood culture, but no other evidence of infection.
