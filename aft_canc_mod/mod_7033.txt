There is mild positive ulnar variance.
There is an amorphous density in the region of the triangular fibrocartilage which may indicate chondrocalcinosis.
There is degenerative change of the first CMC and triscaphe joints.
IMPRESSION: Distal radius fracture with mild positive ulnar variance.
No bleeding was noted.
No ulceration or erythema was noted.
The sphincterotomy was observed for about 5 minutes - no bleeding was noted.
Impression: Polyp in the stomach body Erythema and friability in the antrum No fresh or old blood was found in the stomach or duodenum.
No bleeding was noted.
No ulceration or erythema was noted.
The sphincterotomy was observed for about 5 minutes - no bleeding was noted.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: No source for melena was found.
Protruding Lesions A single sessile 10 mm polyp of benign appearance was found in the cecum.
Given patient's co-morbidities and poor bowel prep this was not removed.
Poor bowel preparation Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum  [**2183-8-14**] Transesophageal Echo Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic valve abscess is seen.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is moderate-to-severe (3+) tricuspid regurgitation.
IMPRESSION: No definite vegetations identified; thickened and calcified aortic valve leaflets, with aortic stenosis present (not quantified).
Interval increase in size of extramedullary intradural soft tissue mass at the C7-T1 interspace, resulting in rightward cord deviations/mass effect.
Mild anterior wedge compression deformity involving T5 which appears new from [**2174**] exam but not acute.
Additional multilevel cervical and lumbar spondylosis is not significantly changed.
No pericholecystic fluid or inflammatory changes to suggest cholecystitis.
Focal stranding of the right pannicular fat may represent asymetric edema or panniculitis .
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectatic changes.
The bibasal atelectasis is present but there is no evidence of overt failure.
The left internal jugular line tip is at the junction of the brachiocephalic vein and SVC.
The left basal opacity most likely represents area of atelectasis and is unchanged since the prior study.
Brief Hospital Course: 88 year-old woman with history of morbid obesity, HTN, atrial fibrillation on warfarin, and diastolic heart failure who presented with gallstone pancreatitis and a right wrist fracture.
She underwent ERCP and sphincterotomy which was complicated by hypoxia and hypotesnion.
Her post-procedure course was complicated by multiple episodes of melena with progressive anemia.
Her course was further complicated by: NSTEMI, MRSA and Coag negative staph bacteremia and septicemia and Acute Renal Failure.
# Fevers/bacteremia:  Pt was febrile on [**8-9**] to 100.9 and BCx were positive for MRSA.
Pt had mild temp (100-101) on [**8-10**].
Concern for subacute endocarditis (staph viridans vs staph epidermidis), but TEE negative for endocarditis.
MRI of spine did not reveal epidural abscess/osteo/diskitis.
CT abd only shows panniculitis of the right pannicular fat.
From [**8-17**] to [**8-20**], pt became intermittently hypotensive.
She was bolused 4L NS w/ little response, a CVL was introduced for monitoring and she was started on pressors.
The patient became progressively bradycardic and died of cardiorespiratory failure at 8:25 pm.
Most likely cause of death was felt to be overwhelming sepsis causing severe acidosis.
# Gallstone pancreatitis:  She presented with abdominal pain, low-grade fevers, and an elevated lipase in the setting of choledolithiasis.
As noted above, she had multiple episodes of melena post procedure.
Concern for toxic shock liver versus recurrence of biliary obstruction.
# Acute Renal Failure: On [**8-17**], pt's creatinine increased from 1.0 to 2.1.
# Progressive anemia with melena:  She had three episodes of melena after ERCP with a four point hematocrit drop, but her hematocrit later stabilized at 25-26 g/dl without transfusion.
She was thought to have bleeding from her sphincterotomy but no active bleeding was visualized on EGD, and the only pathological findings were a beefy antrum and a gastric polyp with a non-bleeding ulcer.
Coumadin was stopped despite the high risk of stroke because of the GI bleeding.
# Meningioma:  MRI revealed increase in mass, likely a meningioma, in her her T-spine.
# Atrial fibrillation:  She was on warfarin at home but this was held at the time of admission because of the need for a procedure (ERCP).
# Right wrist fracture:  She fell at home and suffered a non-displaced distal radius fracture.
Ortho repeated XR, which revealed no change from previous image.
OT consult on [**8-19**] for short open splint for wrist, and ROM as tolerated.
# Chronic diastolic heart failure:  She was continued on lasix and had no acute issues.
