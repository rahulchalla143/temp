CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever and neutropenia.
The patient had discontinued Taxol and was only on 714X, which is an experimental Canadian drug.
However, on [**2137-9-26**], he was admitted to [**Hospital1 188**] with fever and neutropenia.
He was treated with ceftazidime, but had no signs of infection.
His ceftazidime was discontinued, and he had no evidence of infection despite a thorough Infectious Disease workup, including an Infectious Disease consult, six blood cultures which were negative, multiple negative urine and stool cultures.
The patient was doing fine at home until Monday, when he had increased weakness, increased urinary frequency, and fever from 100 to 100.5.
He denies cough, nausea, vomiting, sore throat, headache, or abdominal pain.
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed in [**2133-11-23**]; a lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma status post multiple chemotherapeutic treatments 2.
Depression 4.
Question of benign prostatic hypertrophy 7.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, anicteric, two small mm lesions on the lower lip.
Neck:  Supple, no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular:  Regular, tachycardic, with ectopic beats.
Skin:  Two mm to 1 cm black lesions with raised center.
Urinalysis:  Urobilinogen 4, no red cells, no white cells, no bacteria.
Chest x-ray:  No infiltrates, no effusion, no lymphadenopathy, no change from prior chest x-ray.
Given the magnitude of the patient's temperature rise in conjunction with his skin lesions and neutropenic state, we were concerned about possible infectious etiology explaining these findings.
Fluconazole was also started for his hepatic lesions.
Throughout the first day of admission, however, the patient became increasingly more lethargic and difficult to arouse, with decreased blood pressure to 80/50 and again he was treated with fluids and platelet transfusion.
Workup there revealed a staphylococcus aureus bacteremia sensitive to oxacillin.
His course in the Intensive Care Unit was complicated by an acute myocardial infarction in the setting of hypotension and sepsis.
An echocardiogram performed during this time revealed a decreased ejection fraction between 30 and 40%, with an inferior and posterior hypokinesis.
The patient continued to improve from a hemodynamic and sepsis point of view, and was stable for transfer back to the Oncology service on [**2137-10-11**].
Given the patient's methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia without a clear source, in the setting of neutropenia, Infectious Disease was contact[**Name (NI) **] with regards to antibiotic duration recommendations.
With regard to the patient's myocardial infarction in the setting of hypotension, he was started on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor, as these have been shown to be myocardial protective.
It should be noted that he will benefit from an outpatient stress test, but this will be reconsidered by his primary physicians once his acute issues have resolved.
Dermatology was consulted during this hospitalization for biopsy, which revealed a pathology consistent with septic vasculitis and therefore treated with oxacillin as above.
Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia with sepsis 2.
Acute myocardial infarction in the setting of sepsis 3.
Neutropenia  (It should be noted that the patient's neutropenia resolved during the hospitalization, and his GCSF was discontinued at this time.)
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 5.
Oral candidiasis 6.
