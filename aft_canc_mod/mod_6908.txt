ACTIVE ISSUES # Diabetes Mellitus type 2, with Hyperglycemia after 2 days of hypoglycemia at outside hospital from probable Sulfonurea overdose - Patient was treated with insulin initially and her blood sugars stabilized.
# Hyperkalemia - Likely related to elevated glucose levels.
CHRONIC ISSUES # CLL - relapsed with worsening lymphadenopathy and lymphocytosis.
Lisinopril was held at time of discharge (as above)  # Chronic ITP: Platelets at baseline of high 20s, low 30s.
# Chronic diastolic CHF: Patient euvolemic during admission.
# HTN: Continued home amlodipine  # Hypothyroidism: continued home levothyroxine  # H/o gout: continued allopurinol  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES 1) Hypertension - Stopped Lisinopril due to hyperkalemia, and patient was hypertensive during this admission.
