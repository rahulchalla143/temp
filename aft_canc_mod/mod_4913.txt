Admission Date:  [**2193-1-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2193-1-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2131-2-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5134**] Chief Complaint: Weakness and fall  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Pt is a 61 yo F with undifferentiated carcinoma in lung and liver who presents from an OSH after a fall at home.
Of note, patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**12-18**] -[**12-25**] with nausea and vomiting, thought to be due to his underlying malignancy.
His hospital course was complicated by a code STEMI which was due to a moderate size pericardial effusion requiring a brief stay in the CCU.
Pleural effusion was never tapped.
he has not been eating and drinking well due to anorexia and lack of appetitite, and reports eating on average about 1 meal a day, usually only a [**Location (un) 6002**].
He was at home when he felt he 'lost his balance' and fell to his knees the day of admission.
No head strike.
Did not loose his bowels or bladder.
No seizure activity.
Pt also with some nausea and vomiting, but fairly well controlled with his prochlorperazine, and last episode was a few days ago.
He presented to an OSH ([**Hospital3 417**]) where a CXR demonstrated a new pleural effusion.
While there, pt had one episode of AF with RVR to the 180s with associated hypotension with systolics down to 80s.
Bedside TTE done by ED showed moderate sized pericardial effusion with no evidence of tamponade physiology.
CCU fellow was consulted for possible CCU admission, but did not think the current pericardial effusion was large enough to warrant CCU admission for pericardiocentesis or STAT TTE and declined the admission.
Heme-onc fellow was also consulted and declined OMED admission given recent medicine admit and that the patient had not yet established care with his new oncologist, and that chemotherapy would be unlikely at this time.

Pertinent Results: STUDIES: EKG: SR, 98 BPM, normal axis, normal intervals, TWF in III, AVF, AVL, V5, V6  EKG [**1-7**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
Since the previous tracing of [**2193-1-3**] there is atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
ST-T wave abnormalities are new.
EKG [**1-16**]: Sinus tachycardia with atrial premature beats and ventricular premature beat.
Modest low amplitude T wave changes are non-specific.
Imaging: CXR - [**2193-1-1**] - Large R sided pleural effusion, appear slightly worsened compared to [**2192-12-22**] CXR.
Persistent right basilar opacification and increased extent of lobulated pleural opacities suggesting enlarging pleural-based fluid collections and possibly burden of metastatic disease.
Generalized but somewhat heterogeneous mild new opacification of the right lung in conjunction with increasing pleural opacities, which may represent atelectasis, the result of lymphatic obstruction, although pneumonia is not excluded.
Progression of large complex hepatic lesion which now occupies greater than 60% of the hepatic parenchyma.
Findings are concordant with recent biopsy results of poorly differentiated carcinoma.
At this point, there  are no imaging features suggestive of abscess.
Increase in size and of numerous pulmonary nodules seen on limited views of the lung bases.
New appearance of multiple mesenteric implants suggestive of metastatic disease.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion, primarily anterior to the right ventricle.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Small to moderate-sized pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse and brief diastolic invagination of the right ventricular free wall.
IMPRESSION: findings are consistent with early cardiac tamponade  CT ([**2192-1-3**]) FINDINGS: The aorta opacifies normally without evidence of dissection.
The pulmonary arteries opacify normally without intraluminal filling defects to suggest pulmonary embolism.
A new pericardial effusion is moderate in severity, causing straightening of the ventricular septum and distortion and attenuation of the right atrium, concerning for tamponade physiology.
No pericardial nodularity is identified.
Multiple mediastinal lymph nodes are new or enlarged including a 14-mm lower right paratracheal lymph node which is new.
Numerous non-pathologically enlarged upper paratracheal and thoracic inlet lymph nodes are new.
A right hilar lymph node is mildly enlarged measuring 11 mm, previously measuring 9 mm.
Previously identified pleural thickening and nodularity have rapidly progressed within the right hemithorax with numerous new pleural metastases identified and involving both the minor and major fissure.
Several areas of loculated pleural fluid are noted, most prominent along the paramediastinal pleural surface and within the major and minor fissures.
A new left pleural effusion is moderate in severity.
No pleural thickening or nodularity is noted within the left hemithorax.
Right lower lobe airspace consolidation is attributed to atelectasis.
Multiple new pulmonary nodules are identified including a 6-mm left lower lobe nodule (400B:36), a 3-mm right lower lobe nodule (3:52), a ground glass 9-mm nodule in the right upper lobe (3:39), a 4-mm right upper lobe nodule (3:34) and a 4-mm right upper lobe nodule, consistent with pulmonary metastases.
There are no bony lesions suspicious for malignancy.
Multilevel degenerative changes noted throughout the spine.
Although the study was not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, numerous low-density lesions within the liver have increased in size, most consistent with worsening hepatic metastases.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Moderate pericardial fluid causing attenuation and distortion of the right atrium, concerning for tamponade physiology.
Marked interval progression of extensive pleural metastases in the right hemithorax, bilateral pulmonary nodules and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, all of which is consistent with worsening metastatic disease.
Moderate left pleural effusion; no pleural nodules.
Partially imaged numerous low-density lesions in the liver, demonstrating interval increase in size.

Poorly differentiated carcinoma: Noted on liver and pleural biopsies.
Presumed HCC with sarcomatoid growth.
Cancer occupying more than 60% of liver, with metastatic disease to the pleural space.
A discussion with pt and family outlined patient had a terminal disease, and further surgical or medical interventions would yield little benefit.
Cause of death was likely congestive heart failure related to malignant pericardial effusion secondary to advanced likely hepatocellular carcinoma.
Palliative Care: the patient received anti-emetics, anxiolytics and narcotics for relief of symptoms prescribed with the guidance of the palliative care team.
Pleural effusion: Noted new pleural effusion on admission.
Had bedside ultrasound by pulmonary team which illustrated metastatic disease in the pleural space, with no tapable effussion.
No intervention was performed, as aspiration of fluid would not relieve symptomatology.
Pericardial effusion: Most likely malignant effusion in setting of known oncologic disease.
TTE's were concerning for early tamponade physiology.
Considering effusion was most likely from a malignant etiology, tapping the effusion was declined by cardiology, as they felt a pericardial window was the most necessary intervention for relieving the fluid accumulation.
Family meeting held, and pursuit of a pericardial window was deemed very aggressive, and would not change patient's overall prognosis given metastaic disease, and would contribute more morbidity than benefit.
The patient was monitored for worsening fluid accumulation or signs of tamponade.
Atrial fibrillation: Patient had episode of AF w/ RVR associated with hypotension in the ED on presentation.
Inciting etiology was unclear, but presumed to be due to irritation from pericardial effusion or fluid shifts in setting of persistent nausea and vomiting.
Had multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate while on the medical floors.
For breakthrough RVR, responded well to 10 mg IV diltiazem push over 2 minutes.
Hemodynamically stable for approximately 10 days prior to death with no known episodes of atrial fibrillation, although blood pressures consistently low with SBP's in the 80s-90's and DBP's in the 40-60's.
Fall: Likely mechanical in the setting of deconditioning/weakness from his malignancy versus dehydration from nausea/vomiting.
No history of any pre-heralding symptoms concernign for vasovagal, or neurologic etiology of his fall.
