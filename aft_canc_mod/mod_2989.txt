No pneumothorax.
There has been no other significant interval change.
IMPRESSION: Right-sided IJ with its tip in the SVC; no pneumothorax.
No other significant interval change  CT chest/abdomen/pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1) Interval development of small bilateral pleural effusions and free fluid within the abdomen and pelvis without abscess identified.
2) No significant interval change in previously described patchy pulmonary opacities.
3) Unchanged liver lesions and celica axis and mesenteric lymph nodes.
4) No new lesions identified.
4) Interval development of nonspecific colon wall thickening, which is not well distended.
Ischemic colitis is considered less likely given distribution.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 71 yo male, h/o metastatic adenocarcinoma of the GE junction, s/p irinotecan/carboplatin, now on experimental chemotherapeutic regimen, admitted with hypotension (?sepsis), currently stable, being treated for ?pneumonia and poor PO intake.
Hypotension: Initially, sepsis by protocol was instituted in the setting of increased lactate, hypotension, hyperthermia, tachycardia, and an elevated white count.
The patient was hypotensive in the ED which respondeed to fluid boluses.
Other causes: pneumonia, sinusitis, line infection, or autonomic dysfxn [**2-23**] cisplain therapy.
Screening for adrenal insuffiency was negative.
Review of the pt's OMR chart shows that this was his baseline bp [**Known lastname **] to any chemotx.
The levofloxacin was continued until [**2174-1-24**] for empiric pneumonia coverage (and given history of strep pneumo on bronch recently).
CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis was negative for any obvious source of infection, and he remained afebrile with a normal WBC.
He was persistently hypotensive (SBP's 80-100) while in-house, although this appears to be close to his baseline when old OMR notes were referenced.
Pt also had TTE showing mild diastolic dysfunction but o/w no signficant structural heart disease to account for syncope.
Although syncope was not induced, pt was quite symptomatic w/ these changes.
As mentioned below, pt has had difficulties w/ adequate po intake secondary to anorexia - however, he was not felt to be profoundly dehydrated.
It was theorized that there may be component of autononic dysfunction (for unclear reasons) causing orthostasis and tilt test was performed.
Torso CT was obtained to evaluate fo disease progression as his degree of FTT is out of proportion to his chemotherpy and known stage of his disease.
CT did not show any significant interval change in his disease.
Chemotherpy has been held for a few weeks given his degreee of weight loss and lethargy (currently on ?experimental bevacizumab and doxetaxol; His irinotecan/carboplatin was stopped in [**10-25**] secondary to disease progression).
He was seen by oncology consult team while in-house but had no active oncologic issues.
Of note, the oncology team thought his level of anorexia was not likely solely due to his disease or chemotherapeutic regimen.
He has been asked to call dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] following d/c for f/u to discuss further managment of esophageal cancer.
Anorexia: As per patient and his wife, he has had a [**Last Name 19390**] problem with poor PO intake.
He was recently started on megace without much success.
Psychiatry was consulted and did not feel the anorexia was secondary to depressive symptoms.
Nutrition was consulted, and IVF were continued as needed for poor PO intake.
?Colonic Thickening with free fluid: This was seen incidentally on staging CT of chest and abdomen.
Pt had no symptoms of diarrhea or abdominal pain, and he had a benign abdominal exam.
Dispo: It was felt that an acute rehabilitation facility was more appropriate than returning home given pt's poor PO intake, debilitation, and generalized wekaness.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Acetaminophen-Codeine 300-30 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain, insomina.
11. heparin 5000 units sc tid while lying in bed   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - Acute Rehab  Discharge Diagnosis: hypotension, unclear etiology resolved orthotasis syncope presumed secondary to orthostasis metastatic esophageal carcinoma   Discharge Condition: fair  Discharge Instructions: please return to ed or [**Name8 (MD) 138**] md [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5162**], chills, shortness of breath, palpitations, chest pain, syncope.
