No facial droop.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2180-3-15**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to       hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..     FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
If present, AFB may take 3-8 weeks to grow..     FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    No Virus isolated so far.
There is a right apical pleural thickening.
No consolidation or edema is evident.
Minimal linear atelectasis is seen laterally in the left lung base.
No effusion or pneumothorax is evident.
The bones are diffusely osteopenic with a stable lower thoracic compression fracture as previously demonstrated.
IMPRESSION: Stable radiographic examination with known thoracic compression fracture and no acute pulmonary process .
CT HEAD [**3-8**] FINDINGS: There is no edema or shift of normally midline structures to suggest the presence of an intracranial mass.
No intracranial hemorrhage is seen.
There is no evidence of major vascular territorial infarct.
Periventricular white matter hypodensities indicate the presence of chronic small vessel ischemia.
Slight prominence of the ventricles and sulci are consistent with age-appropriate atrophy.
No evidence to suggest the presence of intracranial masses.
However, if indicated, MRI is more sensitive for the detection of metastatic lesions.
Chronic small vessel ischemia.
[**2180-3-11**] MRI OF THE BRAIN:  Multiple FLAIR hyperintense foci are noted in the cerebral white matter on both sides, likely related to sequelae of chronic small vessel occlusive disease, given the patient's age.
There is no acute infarction or intracranial hemorrhage.
There is a small dural-based enhancing lesion, in the right frontal region (series 11, image 14), best seen only on the axial post-contrast sequences, due to artifacts on the coronal plane, measuring 0.8 x 0.6 cm.
This can represent a small meningioma or less likely a focus of dural-based metastasis.
The coronal post-contrast sequence is limited due to motion artifacts and a small focus of enhancement noted anteriorly in the right frontal region (series 12, image 5) could not be identified with a corresponding abnormality on the axial post-contrast sequence.
Mildly prominent ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces are slightly prominent, consistent with age-appropriate involution of the brain parenchyma.
[**3-11**]: MRI OF THE PITUITARY: On the pre-contrast sequences of the pituitary, there is no enlargement of the sella or the pituitary gland, the infundibular stalk is almost in the midline.
The post-contrast sequences are limited due to motion artifacts, hence, assessment for small focal lesions is limited.
No definite enlargement of the pituitary gland or no significant displacement of the infundibular stalk of the optic chiasm.
Multiple FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the cerebral white matter on both sides likely represent sequelae of chronic small vessel occlusive disease.
Small, 0.8 x 0.3 cm enhancing extradural lesion in the right frontal region, likely representing meningioma, retrospectively noted on the CT scan done on [**2178-5-2**], with no significant change.
Study is significantly limited due to motion artifacts on the post-contrast sequences of the pituitary.
Hence, evaluation for focal lesions is limited.
No significant changes since the MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**2180-3-9**].
No evidence of pituitary abnormality on this limited examination.
[**2180-3-14**] CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: Moderate-high grade stenosis of left subclavian artery beyond its origin is slightly worse than [**2178-12-30**].
There is no pericardial effusion.
Bilateral pleural effusions are minimal, the lungs are otherwise clear.
There is no central or axillary lymphadenopathy.
1.4 cm hypodensity on the left lobe liver (3:38, 5:3), new since [**12-30**], is suspiscious for metastatic focus.
There is no free fluid or free air.
A focal calyceal diverticulum is more prominent than [**2180-5-2**], likely secondary to scarring.
There is no hydronephrosis.
There are no enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There is no free fluid, free air or evidence of obstruction.
Fibroid uterus is unchanged since [**2178-5-2**], with thickenedd endometrium similar to taht seen on most recent ultrasound.
Bladder is likely adherent to anterior abdominal wall with diastatsis of the rectus abdominus noted.
Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious blastic or lytic lesions.
A chronic compression fracture is noted at T11.
New 1.5 cm hypodensity in the left lobe of the liver is suspicious for metastasis.
Otherwise unchanged appearance of partial hepatectomy, left adrenalectomy and left retroperitoneal mass resection.
Post-right hip arthroplasty changes are noted.
Tiny bilateral pleural effusions.
Endometrial thickening is similar to [**12-30**] .
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] [**2180-3-29**] IMPRESSION: Since the previous MRI examination, there is increased signal identified within the spinal cord with enhancement in its central portion suspicious for cord ischemia versus infarct.
Soft tissue changes are seen from recent surgery.
A small right-sided metastatic lesion seen at C2-3 disc level.
Small extra-axial mass in the right frontal region consistent with meningioma is again identified.
No enhancing intraparenchymal brain lesions are seen.
Moderate changes of small vessel disease.
No evidence of acute infarct.
Head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal in the arteries of anterior circulation with prominent posterior communicating artery.
Pathology: Right Neck Mass: Malignant neoplasm consistent with metastatic adrenal carcinoma, (3.5 x 3 x 0.7 cm) with extensive necrosis and focal vascular invasion.
Brief Hospital Course: # Acute on subacute mental status changes - The patient was admitted with acute MS changes at home.
After review with her family members, they reported a subacute decline since [**Holiday 1451**].
She was brought to the ED with reports of increased fatigue and refusal to take po at home.
She also had increased lethargy and intermittently was not recognizing her family members at home.
CT head negative for evidence of acute CVA.
Her chemistry panel was significant for hypercalcemia - Ca level 11.6 and she was also found to have a UTI.
Given her PMH of adrenal insufficiency concern was given for acute adrenal insufficiency in the setting of an underlying infection.
She received aggressive IVF repletion with subsequent correction of her hypercalcemia and received a course of ceftriaxone for her UTI.
Further workup demonstrated an inappropriately low TSH, elevated prolactin and lower than expected FSH and LH.
The patient underwent an MRI of her pituitary to evaluate for stalk compression vs. metastatic disease.
Neurology consultation was obtained, who felt symptoms unlikely to be caused by small meningioma.
Given her persistent MS changes and history of malignancy and immunosuppression on steroids she underwent lumbar puncture.
CSF was negative for evidence of infection.
CSF cytology to evaluate for metastatic disease was also negative.
A CT torso was performed and on final exam of the imaging the patient was found to have a new 1.5 cm hypodensity in the left lobe of the liver, suspicious for metastasis.
A CT of the spine noted a cervical paraspinal mass.
Pathology of the mass was positive for Metastatic adrenal cancer.
The patient continued with worsening Mental status during her hospitalization with bouts of paranoia and agitation.
On [**2180-3-24**] she became unresponsive and was intubated and sent to the ICU.
She was hypotensive and required pressors.
CT of the Head was done and was negative for ICH or stroke.
Upon transfer, she was noted to have new bilateral upper extremity paresis and was unable to move her arms.
She speaks only in one word responses to yes and no questions.
Several Family meetings have occurred with the primary team, along with her oncologist, endocrinologist and Pain and Palliative Care.
The decision was to transition to hospice given her very poor prognosis.
Ultimately, it is believed that her AMS may be due to leptomeningeal spread of her adrenal carcinoma.
# Metastatic Adrenal Carcinoma - The patient is adrenally insufficient following adrenalectomy for metastatic adrenal CA.
She was placed on stress dose steroids as above given concern for acute adrenal insufficiency in the setting of an underlying infection.
A new neck mass was found on CT of the neck.
The mass was positive for recurrence of her metastatic adrenal cancer.
# Hypothyroidism - The patient was maintained on her home dose of Synthroid 75mcg daily.
# UTI - On admission the patient was found to have a UTI, urine culture grew >100,000 cfu/ml.
# Hx of rectal adenocarcinoma - Patient is s/p Anterior resection of the sigmoid and proximal rectum in [**2169**].
# HTN - Antihypertensives have been discontinued.
# Post-menopausal bleeding - PAP and documented pelvic exam of [**12-1**] by PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
Patient has had several small bleeding episodes while in the hospital.
# Nutrition - The family has decided to allow oral nutrition as tolerated.
