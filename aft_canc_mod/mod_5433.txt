At that time he was diagnosed with Proteus and VRE bacteremia and a liver abscess as well as SBP with peritoneal tap growing sacchromyces cervesiae.
It was determined that he did not want to pursue further aggressive care or invasive procedures, and that after rehab he would prefer hospice level care.
At rehab he spiked a temperature to 101.4 and exhibited increasing lethargy, prompting transfer back to [**Hospital1 18**].
He had a CT abdomen performed which showed persistance of catheter, decrease in size of old abscess and question of new liver abscess.
On presentation now he c/o minimal pain over drain site in RUQ.
He denies nausea, vomiting, or change in bowel movements.
TB as child, spent 7.5 yrs in sanitroium 2. h/o IA 3. h/o detached retina 4. hypercholesterolemia 5. history of biliary obstruction s/p plastic stent [**3-4**] at Good  [**Hospital **] Hospital - brushings concerning for adenocarcinoma, CA  19-9 normal (10) in [**3-4**],  CEA elevated (11) in [**3-4**], CT revealed portohepatic and gallbladder masses in [**3-4**]; patient previously followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 66200**] of gastroenterology at [**Hospital1 1474**].
Liver abscess as above, s/p IR-guided drainage  Social History: former machinist, no ETOH for a few years, retired, lives alone,  multiple pets.
Significant interval decrease in the size of the right hepatic lobe collection drained by the pigtail catheter.
Significant interval increase in inferior right hepatic abscess which is not drained by the indwelling catheter.
Unchanged hypodense lesion within the left lobe of the liver, which may represent a metastasis or a focus of infection.
Probably mild interval increase in intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation compared to [**2-12**], though comparison is difficult given differences in technique.
There is a small amount of pneumobilia centrally within the liver, suggesting at least partial patency of the common bile duct stent.
No evidence of pneumonia.
Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate.
Biliary stricture compatible with malignant biliary stricture in the middle third of the common bile duct and at the bifurcation.
A 60 mm X 10 mm covered wall stent was placed.
[**2132-3-30**] CXR: Worsening bilateral pleural effusions with likely developing fluid overload/failure.
There is severe regional left  ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to distal anterior/anteroseptal akinesis and apical akinesis/dyskinesis (EF 25-35%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: # Septicemia in setting of biliary stent occlusion and liver abscess:  CT showed new liver abscess and worsening intrahepatic biliary dilation.
He was maintained on daptomycin and meropenem in house but will complete his course on vancomycin and meropenem, given enterococcus is sensitive to vancomycin.
He has been hemodynamically stable and afebrile with these treatment interventions.
# Liver abscess: Abd CT showed decreased size of prior right lobe abscess (pigtail in place), but new inferiorly located right liver abscess (~ 6 cm).
# Systolic CHF: Patient noted to have EF 25-35% on ECHO done to rule out an overt vegetation.
He also complained of worsening shortness of breath and had a chest xray which suggested worsening CHF.
He has been started on an ACEI and will need qd weight and dietary restriction for continued management.
# Altered mental status: Improved.
Likely infection is contributing.
Evidence of liver mets.
# Iron deficiency anemia:  Hematocrit stable at 33.
During prior admit, there was discussion of possible hospice placement.
