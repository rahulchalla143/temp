# UGIB: Initially hypotensive with SBP 60's as per HPI.
On [**6-13**] patient had reported hematocrit drop from 27 to 18; received 2 units and subsequent hematocrits >30 and stable (?erroneous value).
EGD was done again in light of hematocrit drop, again showing esophagitis but no other lesions.
Source of bleed appeared to be esophagitis, as no other upper lesions noted.
# Coag negative staph bacteremia.
TTE was done without evidence of vegetation.
He was informed that his treatment regimen was not ideal and could lead to persistent bacteremia and associated poor outcomes, but refused to stay until arrangements could be made (if they could be at all given his insurance).
# Fungemia.
Possible portal of entry from subclinical esophagitis and entry to bloodstream during GI bleed.
The seriousness of fungemia was discussed with him, as well as needs to continue IV antifungal treatments.
He appeared to have good understanding of his disease and its risks (patient also a former nurse) but felt that further workup was unnecessary and he had had his mind set on leaving that day.
Efforts to look for source sites were attempted; he had CT torso (no evidence of source for his fungemia).
Ophthalmology was also consulted for dilated eye exam, to which he initially agreed but then refused once they arrived.
Per PCP and patient, planning for very close followup over the next several weeks to include blood cultures, daily temperature checks, etc.
