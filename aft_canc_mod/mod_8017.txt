HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**] is a 79 year old male with a past medical history significant for a non-small cell lung carcinoma with metastases to the brain status post two cycles of chemotherapy with Carboplatin/Taxol, who experienced a fall on [**9-15**] upon exiting his car and walking five to six steps.
He notes no preceding events prior to the fall, and notes that it was not mechanical in etiology.
The patient was taken to an outside hospital and was found to have a left hip subtrochanteric fracture without neurovascular impairment.
At the time, he was found to have a decreased hematocrit and was transfused.
In the Operating Room during this procedure, the patient had two episodes of supraventricular tachycardia associated with a decrease in blood pressure ameliorated by cardioversion on each occasion.
The patient had a third episode of supraventricular tachycardia while in the Intensive Care Unit which was treated successfully with adenosine.
Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**] experienced a fourth episode of supraventricular tachycardia while in the Intensive Care Unit which converted into normal sinus rhythm with Lopressor.
On subsequent episodes of supraventricular tachycardia with hypotension, the patient was bolused with normal saline.
The recommendations per Cardiology were to continue the Amiodarone intravenously and continue to use Adenosine as needed for symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia.
Metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma diagnosed in [**2186-8-6**], metastatic to the brain.
Malignant pleural effusions status post pleurodesis.
History of supraventricular tachycardia during his last hospitalization.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
He has no known occupational exposures.
Father deceased at age 87 secondary to pneumonia.
In general, the patient appears in no acute distress sitting up in a chair.
Neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy and no carotid bruits.
Chest is symmetric excursion, moderate air movement, no dullness to percussion.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2; II/VI systolic ejection murmur with no gallops, no rubs.
STUDIES:  ECG on [**2186-9-18**], demonstrated sinus rhythm, right bundle branch block, QRS morphology, potential left atrial abnormality, no significant changes from previous tracing on [**9-17**].
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**] has a history of supraventricular tachycardia present during his last hospitalization treated with beta blockade.
He had experienced a fall without a clear precipitating factor or mechanical reason which led to this admission.
During his prior admission, the patient was asymptomatic during his episodes of supraventricular tachycardia on Telemetry.
It is possible that the patient's supraventricular tachycardia led to his fall prior to admission.
Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**] had experienced episodes of supraventricular tachycardia during the procedure and peri-procedure and he was initiated on an Amiodarone drip after two cardioversions.
Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**] has a history of hypertension and has been on Lopressor and Terazosin as an outpatient.
Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**] will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] for his supraventricular tachycardia on [**10-18**] at 01:00 p.m. in the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Building.
ORTHOPEDICS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**] was diagnosed with a left subtrochanteric hip fracture status post fall and transferred from the outside hospital for open reduction and internal fixation.
This procedure was performed on [**2186-9-17**], with the complication of supraventricular tachycardia as described above.
Recommendations were made to continue daily dressing changes to the wound sites and the patient was to continue with thigh-high TEDS stockings to the lower extremities.
HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY:  Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**] was recently diagnosed in [**2186-8-6**] with non-small cell lung cancer and has received two cycles of Carboplatin/Taxol.
He is being followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for his oncologic care.
Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**] was scheduled to have this SRS on [**9-19**], however, this therapy was deferred while he is dealing with the acute issue of his hip fracture.
Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**] was noted to have a significant hematocrit drop while admitted.
12 hours, for a total of six weeks.
Left hip open reduction and internal fixation performed on [**2186-9-17**].
Supraventricular tachycardia.
Metastatic lesions to the left frontal lobe of the brain.
- hold for excessive sedation ( respiratory rate less than 8; oxygen saturation less than 92%).
The patient is to have daily dressing changes to the wound sites.
