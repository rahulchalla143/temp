EXTENT OF INVASION  Primary Tumor:  pT1:  Tumor invades lamina propria or submucosa.
It is felt that the invasive carcinoma seen on the permanent sections is not present on the original frozen section slides.
There is a single green gallstone measuring 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 cm which is bisected to reveal a green crystalline interior.
The mucosa is tan-pink and notable for multiple small yellow flecks.
