Admission Date:  [**2184-12-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2184-12-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-9-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5341**] Chief Complaint: DLBCL with brain mets s/p biopsy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: 74 y.o.m with DLBCL s/p 6 cycles of R-CHOP ([**10-14**]) and XRT to axillary region (current) who presents with two to three weeks of RUE tremors.
He presented at XRT two days ago and his wife expressed concerns of a URI since [**12-1**] with productive cough (green sputum) and sore throat, as well as decreased intake and lethargy.
He has had a 4lb wt loss in the past week.
Due to the concerning story of tremors (and witnessing his tremors while writing) Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 776**] recommended a brain MRI, which revealed a left frontal lobe lesion with mass edema, no shift, no hydrocephalus.
He is s/p biopsy and being admitted to the OMED service for further management of his brain metastasis.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia s/p Appy Pyloric stenosis at 6 mnths .
At that time, he noted a nodule in his left axilla.
He underwent an excisional biopsy of a left axillary lymph node on [**2184-6-23**].
By immunohistochemistry, there were large lymphoid cells diffusely immunoreactive for pan B cell markers CD20+ with co-expression of BCL-2 and BCL-6.
Both pathology and immunohistochemistry were consistent with diffuse large B cell lymphoma with follicular germ cell center.
PET scan on [**2184-7-1**] was notable for innumerable foci of marked abnormal uptake of FDG within lymphadenopathy throughout the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
He received Neulasta after cycle 2 but still had neutropenia w/ ANC 130 on day 14.
PET CT on [**2184-8-12**] was notable for decreased lymphadenopathy throughout.
Family History: Mother had breast cancer at 70, sister had breast cancer at 75.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2184-12-14**] 1:01 AM FINDINGS: There are multiple masses in the brain.
The largest mass in the left frontal lobe measures 2.4 x 2.3 cm with avid enhancement with surrounding vasogenic edema, without significant shift of normally midline structures or herniation.
There is another enhancing mass in the left occipital lobe abutting the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left ventricle measuring 2.5 x 1.4 cm with subependymal involvement and small amount of vasogenic edema, without evidence of herniation.
There is a focus of enhancement in the right caudate head measuring 5 mm.
There is no other area of abnormal signal intensity or diffusion abnormality.
There is no susceptibility artifact.
IMPRESSION: Multiple enhancing masses in the brain as described above, involving left frontal lobe, right caudate head, and left occipital lobe in the periventricular location with subependymal involvement associated with vasogenic edema, suspicious for CNS involvement of lymphoma; however, metastasis from other primary cannot be totally excluded.
No herniation or significant midline shift.
CT STEREOTAXIS W/ CONTRAST  [**2184-12-15**] 3:56 PM FINDINGS: Corresponding to findings of the [**2184-12-14**] MRI, contrast-enhancing masses with surrounding vasogenic edema are noted abutting the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle, within the left frontal lobe along the midline, and adjacent to the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
No shift of normally midline structures is seen.
No acute hemorrhage or major vascular territorial infarct is seen.
Bone along the right lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus demonstrates a ground-glass appearance consistent with fibrous dysplasia.
Pre-operative evaluation for stereotactic biopsy, demonstrating enhancing masses surrounded by vasogenic edema located adjacent to the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle, the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle, and the midline left frontal lobe.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2184-12-15**] 7:20 PM FINDINGS: Two left, and one small right-sided mass and surrounding vasogenic edema are not significantly changed, allowing for differences in technique on this non-contrast enhanced study.
There is no evidence of new hemorrhage.
Craniotomy defect is now seen in the left frontal bone, and there is a tiny amount of pneumocephalus along the inner table in the left frontal lobe, consistent with recent biopsy.
IMPRESSION: Status post biopsy of left frontal lobe mass.
