There are multiple large hypoenhancing mass lesions within the liver, both the right and left lobes, these are predominantly peripheral in location, suggesting that may be either parenchymal or subcapsular in location.
An 11 mm diameter low-density focus in the hepatic dome is too small to characterize.
There is no biliary ductal dilatation.
There is massive confluent retroperitoneal and mesenteric adenopathy.
There is no free fluid or free air in the abdomen.
There is no free pelvic fluid.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.

DIAGNOSIS: HIGH GRADE DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA WITH PLASMA CELL DIFFERENTIATION AND CYTOPLASMIC IMMUNOGLOBULIN CRYSTALS.
Abnormal cells comprise 2% of total gated events (50% of events in blast gate) are CD19 positive and lambda restricted.
DIAGNOSIS: HYPERCELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH TRILINEAGE MATURING HEMATOPOIESIS AND EXTENSIVE INVOLVEMENT WITH LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA.
CD138 is positive in numerous plasma cells, which demonstrate cytoplasmic inclusions similar to those seen in the large cells of the lymphoma.
The plasma cells and some large lymphocytes are Lambda restricted by Kappa and Lambda light chain staining.
The plasma cells predominantly express IgM, with scattered cells expressing IgG and IgA.
The above morphologic and immunophenotypic findings are consistent with involvement by a large B-cell lymphoma with exhibit peculiar plasma cell differentiation features with many cells containing crystalline cytoplasmic inclusions, which are presumably composed of immunoglobulin.
The overall features of this lymphoma are somewhat reminiscent of the so-called polymorphic immunocytoma of the old [**Location (un) **] classification of lymphomas.
Erythrocytes are slightly decreased in number with rouleaux formation, and show occasional target cells, ovalocytes, and polychromatophils with rare cells showing basophilic stippling.
The white blood cell count appears normal with scattered atypical, large lymphoid cells, some of which contain cytoplasmic crystalline inclusions.
Megakaryocytes are present in increased numbers; abnormal forms are seen.
The lymphocyte count includes many large and atypical cells with Golgi crystalline inclusions and fragments of lymphocytes in the background.
There is abnormal localization of immature precursors.
Erythroid precursors are increased in number and show dysplastic features including irregular nuclear contours and nuclear budding.
There is an interstitial infiltrate of atypical lymphoid cells associated with focal fibrosis, which comprises an estimated 20% of marrow cellularity.
These abnormal lymphoid cells span the gamut of cell sizes and many demonstrate atypical plasmacytoid features with dense, deep blue cytoplasm and large crystalline cytoplasmic inclusions.
Small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the standard methods employed.
[**2113-1-25**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Small bilateral pleural effusions persist.
There is probably new atelectasis in the right middle lobe.
Right lower paratracheal adenopathy unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
[**2113-1-27**] KUB Three views of the abdomen and pelvis including left lateral decubitus radiograph demonstrates nonobstructive bowel gas pattern.
No ileus or free air is identified.
IMPRESSION: No obstruction or free air.
IMPRESSION: Slightly limited study with no evidence of DVT of either lower extremity.
There appears to be some interval increase in pleural fluid on the right.
There is continued evidence of volume loss in the lower right lung.
IMPRESSION: Interval increase in pleural fluid on the right.
Brief Hospital Course: 48 M with no significant established PMHx presents with 3 wk h/o fatigue, fevers, night sweats, weight loss, increasing dyspnea, and abdominal pain now found to have retropertioneal lymphadenopathy, small pleural effusions and large liver lesions concerning for possible lymphoma vs. systemic infection.
# Lymphadenopathy/Liver Mass: Patient was found to have large diffuse lymphadenopathy of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis.
He underwent lymph node biopsy and was diagnosed with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (see pathology report above for more details).
His liver mass was thought to represent metastatic disease.
He tolerated the treatment well, but his course was complicated by acute hypoxic respiratory distress as explained below.
# Abdominal Pain L: Patient had persistent abdominal pain, work up revealed no evidence of bowel abscess or perforation.
This was thought to be due to lymphoma involvement of the abdominal lymph nodes and omentum.
His pain was treated with long acting oxycodone and it was well controlled upon discharge.
On admission the differential diagnosis included infectious process vs malignancy.
Extensive infection work up was negative and the patient was diagnosed with diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
His fevers were thought to be part of the B symptoms that manifest in this disease.
# Shortness of breath: Patient initially presented with symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue.
There was no evidence of pericardial effusion on CT or TTE although he had mildly distended JVP.
While the patient was on D2 of [**Hospital1 **] he developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
Initial concern was for tamponade/pericardial effusion however prelim Echo reported no fluid collection.
CXR showed elevated right hemidiaphragm which on prior reports looks unchanged and reported as atelectasis.
Given the high A-a gradient suspect either V/Q mismatch or shunt physiology.
Primary concern was possible disease progression, the rate in the decline of his health status suggests a rapid course.
Infection currently unlikely given his clinical status, although he is febrile it is likely due to his oncological diagnosis given the length of his fevers.
Lower extremity ultrasound did not show evidence of deep venous thrombosis.
Patient was continued on EPOC for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and did not show evidence of tumor lysis syndrome.
An abdominal plain film showed mild constipation without evidence of obstruction or free air.
He was continued on [**Hospital1 **] while in the BMT service and had no O2 requirement after transfer.
# Abnormal LFTs: Patient was noted to have elevated liver enzymes on admission.
This was thought to be due to metastatic liver lesion.
LFT's remained elevated on admission and should be followed as an outpatient.
# ?Wheat Allergy: Patient has a history of an allergic (anaphylactic) reaction to wheat while exercising after ingestion of wheat.
He denied celiac type symptoms, but was kept on a gluten free diet throughout his hospital course.
The patient had no reactions to wheat ingestion.
