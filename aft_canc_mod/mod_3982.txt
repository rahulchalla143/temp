In [**Month (only) **], she noticed increasing dyspnea with mild activity, noticed expiratory wheezes, and had a few episodes of coughing up whole blood clots.
Over the last three days, she has noticed a worsening of her dyspnea with an associated productive cough with yellow mucous.
The patinet spiked a temperature at home to 101, was having marked increase in difficulty breathing, and decided to come to the ED.

Possible inferior myocardial infarction of indeterminate age.
Borderline low voltage.
Pulmonary emboli in the left lower lobe segmental pulmonary arteries extending into the subsegmental arteries.
Large ill-defined right hilar mass with encasement of the distal right main stem bronchus and bronchus intermedius with likely tumor infiltration of the bronchus intermediate versus obstructive debris.
[**12-2**] CT head: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, or acute infarction, within the limitations of recent contrast administration, limiting the evaluation of small masses or hemorrhage.
The ventricles and sulci demonstrate mild prominence, most compatible with atrophic change.
There is periventricular hypodensity, compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
There is non-occluding thrombus in the right greater saphenous vein superiorly, near the level of the saphenofemoral junction.
There is DVT with occluding thrombus in a single peroneal vein on the right.
There is no evidence of deep venous thrombosis of the left lower extremity.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-7-25**], a small atrial septal defect is not identified on the current study (may be due to technical issues and better visualized by TEE).
[**12-4**]: Lymph node biopsy POSITIVE FOR SMALL CELL CARCINOMA.
Micro:  RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2142-12-5**]):  MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 yof with a history of Rheumatoid Arhritis, Paroxysmal afib, HTN, CRF 1.5, C. diff colitis s/p ileostomy who presented to the ED on [**12-2**] worsened cough and shortness of breath x 3 days.
CTA was done which showed left segmental PE and right hilar mass with possible RLL post-obstructive pneumonia.
Because of large clot burden and tumor burden in lungs, a temporary IVC filter was placed.
The patient continued to have oxygen requirement 3L by nasal canula, likely from combination of PE, pneumonia, COPD, and tumor.
# Pneumonia/COPD: Patient found to have obstructive PNA on CTA chest on admission.
Was started on ceftriaxone and levofloxacin but the ceftriaxone was discontinued as pt has known penicillin allergy.
The patient was also given solumedrol and started on high dose prednisone (50 mg Q day) in the ICU for COPD exacerbation.
# Small cell carcinoma: The patient was undergoing outpatient work up for a suspected lung carcinoma prior to presentation.
She underwent bronchoscopy with tumor debreidment and stenting to her bronchus intermedius and had a biopsy which eventually showed small cell carcinoma.
A baseline CEA was found to be elevated at 52.
Although she was at high risk for tumor lysis syndrome, she was not aggressively hydrated because of her already high O2 requirement and fear of pulmonary edema.
The patient did not appear to undergo tumor lysis syndrome and was not discharged on allopurinol, although her hydrochlorothiazide was stopped, as this could potentially worsen hyperuricemia.
It was thought to have been elevated due to a combination of PNA, PE, DVT and chronic steroid use.
# Rash: On [**2142-12-6**] the pt c/o pruritis, and was found to have mild [**Doctor Last Name **] reticular macular rash on forearms, thighs, and back of ears, sparing trunk and back.
She was treated with Sarna lotion but not given benadryl because she reported an anaphylactic reaction in the [**2082**] and was told never to take benadryl.
The rash worsened the next day on her medial thighs revealing circular macules but no papules.
Ultimately the rash spontaneously resolved with no further treatment.
She was placed on telemetry and had no events.
She was initially kept on her home dose amiodarione but this was stopped due to her thyroid dysfunction.
Fe studdies showed decreased TIBC (183), but Ferretin and Fe were WNL.
This is consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
# Gout: The patient did not have any flares.
# RA: The patient did not have any flares.
# Essential Tremor: The patient was continued on her home primidone.
Patient was given emergency phone numbers to call in case symptpoms of fever, shortness of breath, significant nausea or vomiting or other acute symptoms prior to her follow up visit with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **], which is scheduled for next week.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) solution Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) solution Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.

You were found to have a blood clot in your leg and lungs as well as small cell cancer of the lungs and a pneumonia.
You were started on chemotherapy with ETOPOSIDE and CARBOPLATIN for the small cell carcinoma.
[**First Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **], your cancer specialists, for continued management of your small cell lung cancer.
The following medications have been changed: DISCONTINUED hydrochlorothiazide ADDED lovenox ADDED prednisone taper for your COPD ADDED filgrastim for your white blood cells after chemotherapy ADDED levofloxacin to treat your pneumonia ADDED guaifenesin as needed for cough ADDED ondansetron as needed for nausea ADDED ipratropium and albuterol nebulizer treatments for shortness of breath ADDED prescription for home oxygen.
