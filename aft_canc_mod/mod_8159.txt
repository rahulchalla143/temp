Admission Date:  [**2193-5-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2193-5-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2123-11-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Latex / Penicillins  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**] Chief Complaint: transfer from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for dysarthria   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 69 yo F with hx of stroke ([**2161**]), CAD/HTN/CHF EF35% with BiV pacer, transfered from OSH for dysarthria and left hand numbness and weakness.
Her first stroke was in [**2177**] apparently she was left with deficits including Right sided (arm/leg) weakness and dysarthria.
At that time she was told that she had multiple cavernomas.
She has had long-standing HTN as well as a cardiac arrest on [**Holiday 944**] [**2191**] with CHF EF35% and biV pacer placed.
She also has a history of paroxysmal afib but NOT anticoagulated given the brain cavernomas.
Her difficulty with dysarthria started 2 years ago around the time of her new dentures.
The husband and patient both think her speech is now worse than it has ever been but clearly state that there has not been an abrupt change at any point (including the last few weeks).
On [**2193-5-6**], she presented to rehab and told the staff about a fall she had experienced 1 week prior with resultant pain on her right side.
The fall was secondary to tripping on the home carpet and was not associated with presyncope, vertigo or other symptoms.
At [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], a neurology consult led to a head CT which showed the known cavernomas with several areas of bleeding and a possible new thalamic stroke.
The patient denies recent fever, cold, dysuria, other symptoms of infection.
She did have a couple episodes of diarrhea 3 weeks prior.
She does endorse mild left hand numbness (novacaine) which has since dissipated.
Additional history:  Patient is a 69-year-old woman hx of multiple cavernomas who was was transferred from [**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital due to dysarthria and concern for a new left thalamic subacute cavernoma bleed.
She reports slowly progressive dysarthria over the past two years.
She has also had increasing difficulty with walking, requiring a cane six weeks ago.
Since then, she noted increased difficulty walking and has been using a walker.
She denies focal weakness of the arms or legs.
She has occasional numbness of her fingertips but no other numbness or paresthesias.
Her dysarthria seems slightly worse.
No acute changes in her vision.
Staff was concerned that she had increased dysarthria and referred her to [**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital.
First CT scan at noon at [**Hospital3 26615**] showed a new hyperintensity in the anterolateral left thalamus with a surrounding hypodensity (that was not seen on prior MRI brain in [**2191**]).
There was also a new 2mm hyperintensity in the medial left occipital lobe (not seen on the MRI brain in [**2191**]).
Chronic cavernomas were seen in the right basal ganglia (measuring 3.5mm diameter), right posterior frontal, left frontal anterior lobe, and left medial thalamus.
Additional PMH: She had a seizure during her pregnancy in [**2154**] that possibly related to eclampsia.
In [**2177**] she had an episode of right arm and leg weakness, and dysarthria.
Left knee replacement.
Past Medical History: - Multiple cavernomas likely rpresenting an inherited syndrome given that both sons have multiple cavernomas.
- Cardiac arrest ([**Holiday 944**] [**2191**]) s/p BiV pacer - CHF EF 35% - CAD - Paroxysmal Afib (none currently) - cannot be on anticoagulation/antiplatelets given her cavernomas - hypothyroidism   Social History: lives with husband, retired, currently going to rehab twice/three times per week, no alcohol, no cigarettes, no illicits   Family History: - both sons have cavernomas and one was operated on ([**Hospital1 2025**] and [**Hospital1 756**])   Physical Exam: Admission Physical Examination: VS Afebrile, 124/92 68 12 96%RA GEN: NAD, pleasant HEENT: MMM, OP clear CV: RRR S1S2 Lungs: CTA b/l including bibasilar bases Abd: soft, nt, nd, Ext: warm, wp  Neuro exam:  Mental status: Alert, oriented X3, DOW backward fast without errors, memory of recent events intact, speech fluent without paraphasic errors, comprehension full, speech dysarthric and slowed, difficulty repeat "hungry hippopotamus", "[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]-[**Last Name (Prefixes) **]-la", "ga-ga-ga", "pa-pa-pa" No neglect, no difficulty with confrontational naming of stroke card, difficulty [**Location (un) 1131**] because of significant dysarthria, no deficits when writing  Cranial Nerves: I: Olfaction not tested.
Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.
No pronator drift bilaterally.
No adventitious movements, such as tremor, noted.
No asterixis noted.
-Coordination: No intention tremor, mild dysdiadochokinesia noted b/l Mild dysmetria on FNF on the RIGHT.
Discharge physical examination: Inattention, significant dysarthria, mild right facial weakness with reflex asymmetry on the right with right extensor plantar and clumsier movement in the right hand.
Patient did not use her cane properly, had en-bloc turning with unstable gait although this would certainly have been helped by the approprate use of her cane.
Radiology: OSH CT head [**2193-5-6**] 12:26 Prlim read: a new hyperintensity in the anterolateral left thalamus with a surrounding hypodensity (that was not seen on prior MRI brain in [**2191**]).
There was also a new 2mm hyperintensity in the medial left occipital lobe (not seen on the MRI brain in [**2191**]).
Chronic cavernomas were seen in the right basal ganglia (measuring 3.5mm diameter), right posterior frontal, left frontal anterior lobe, and left medial thalamus.
There is moderate cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta but no evidence of acute lung disease such as pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
No pneumothorax.
No pleural effusions.
Atrial sensing with ventricular pacing.
The paced beats are unusual and may indicate fusion beats versus biventricular pacing or could be variant.
No previous tracing available for comparison.

Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 65 126 102 430/438 75 94 69  Brief Hospital Course: 69 yo RHF with HTN, long history of miltiple cavernomas s/p operation with FH of sons both having multiple cavernomas (1 son tested and negative for CCM [**1-8**]), CHF s/p cardiac arrest s/p PPM, who presented on [**2193-5-6**] with gradually worsened dysarthria.
Neurological examination revealed inattention, significant dysarthria, mild right facial weakness with reflex asymmetry on the right with right extensor plantar and clumsier movement in the right hand.
OSH CT head at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] revealed multiple cavernomas with a new hyperintensity in the anterolateral left thalamus with a surrounding hypodensity (that was not seen on prior MRI brain in [**2191**]).
There was also a new 2mm hyperintensity in the medial left occipital lobe (not seen on the MRI brain in [**2191**]).
Given her history and the imaging results, it seems likely that the anterolateral left thalamic cavernoma and the medial left occipital lobe cavernoma are subacute to chronic lesions.
Chronic cavernomas were seen in the right basal ganglia (measuring 3.5mm diameter), right posterior frontal, left frontal anterior lobe, and left medial thalamus.
CXR revealed moderate cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta but no evidence of acute lung disease.
The etiology of her worse dysarthria is likely due to hemorrhage of her thalamic cavernoma which likely also involves the internal capsule, superimposed on her chronic dysarthria.
Symptoms were stable although patient did not use her cane properly, had en-bloc turning with unstable gait although this would certainly have been helped by the approprate use of her cane.
7. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain fever.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7665**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: - New hemorrhage into cavernomas in the left thalamus and likely left occipital lobe - History of multiple cavernomas with evidence of prior bleeding likely representing an inherited phenomenon   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Neurologic: Inattention, significant dysarthria, mild right facial weakness with reflex asymmetry on the right with right extensor plantar and clumsier movement in the right hand.
Patient did not use her cane properly, had en-bloc turning with unstable gait although this would certainly have been helped by the approprate use of her cane.
You presented with worsening slurred speech.
CT scans at the outside hospital revealed your known multiple cavernomas and a small area of new hemorrhage on the left side of your brain called the thalamus.
Your blood pressure is controlled and there is no other intervntion that can be done at this time regarding your cavernomas.
