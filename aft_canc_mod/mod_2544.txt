He went to [**Hospital3 **] ER with shortness of breath, tachycardia, and lower extremity edema.
He was in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response at the OSH and ruled in by cardiac enzymes for non-ST elevation MI.
He was in pulmonary edema and diuresed with lasix.
He has been constipated in the past few weeks and attributes this to oxycodone use (for history of spinal compression fracture).
No abdominal pain.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: Pt was diagnosed with AML MO subtype in [**2192-12-5**] after 2 months of progressively worsening fatigue and dyspnea on exertion.
Marrow examination [**4-9**] showed no evidence of leukemia.
Hypertension 2.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 3.
Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation- off coumadin since [**1-9**] 4.
Coronary Artery Disease --s/p echo [**2193-5-14**] LVEF 50% Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
--s/p Stress Test [**5-8**]-IMPRESSION: Borderline EKG evidence of myocardial ischemia at peak exercise in the absence of anginal symptoms at the achieved level of work (unchanged from prior stress in [**2185**]).
--s/p Coronary catheterization following abnormal stress test in  [**2185**] showing up-sloping ST depressions with normal Thallium image.
Showed non- flow limiting disease with a tapering LAD 5) type II diabetes (diet and oral [**Doctor Last Name 360**] controlled) 6) h/o salivary duct stone 7) CRI: BL Cr 1.7 - ?
Illicits: none Toxins: No exposures   Family History: Mother: died at age [**Age over 90 **] with h/o HTN, Afib Father: MI in 40s Brother: premature CAD, recent dx prostate CA.
No family history of cancer/leukemia/lymphoma   Physical Exam: Vitals: 96.9F  HR 74  BP 134/86  RR 20  97%/2.5L General: alert and oriented, no acute distress, speaking in full sentences HEENT: PERRL EOMI anicteric sclera, MMM, OP clear without lesions or thrush Neck: No JVD Lungs: bilateral crackles and wheezes heard with rhoncorous sounds throughout CV: RRR S1 and S2 audible without m/r/g Abd: Soft, NT, ND NABS, No masses.
The aorta is tortuous with no focal dilatation.
There is no pleural effusion.
Sinus rhythm, left bundle branch block, left axis deviation.
New multifocal peribronchiolar and peripheral ground-glass opacities.
The appearance suggests infectious process, most likely due to RSV in the setting of bone marrow transplant, although infectious etiologies and COP are also possible.
Minimal diffuse bronchial dilation, a finding that may be seen with obliterative bronchiolitis.
Expiratory images were not performed to demonstrate potential air trapping.
This could be due to an early bronchopneumonia, septic emboli, or multifocal aspiration.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 70 year old male with AML s/p Allo BMT complicated by GVHD of lungs and skin transferred from an outside hospital with DVT, NSTEMI in the setting of Afib with RVR, and worsening shortness of breath.
His VQ scan did not show evidence of pulmonary embolus.
He had severe dyspnea on admission which was likely multifactorial, for the most part being secondary to his bronchiolitis obliterans/GVHD of the lungs with an element of congestive heart failure secondary to his NSTEMI.
He was diuresed and his heart failure was treated.
His mycophenolate had to be decreased secondary to thrombocytopenia and he was begun on tacrolimus 1mg po bid.
His chronic restrictive lung disease was very difficult to manage and he remained dyspneic with a 2-4L N/C oxygen requirement despite maximal diuresis.
A CXR on [**7-8**] showed an ill-defined density concerning for a fungal infx so he recieved a 14d course of caspofungin with resolution of this radiographic finding.
As part of his thrombocytopenia work-up he was found to have a positive CMV viral load and was started on gancicyclovir.
He was afebrile this admission, but became hypothermic near the end of his course.
Blood and urine cultures were persistently negative for bacterial infection.
Toward the end of his course Mr. [**Known lastname 25817**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status declined with increasing somnolence.
He did not have focal neurologic symptoms.
He likely had steroid myopathy as well as profound wasting from non-use.
In the end Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] had multiple discussions with various providers about her husbands [**Name (NI) **] clinical picture and poor prognosis.
he was begun on a morphine drip with a scopolamine patch with ativan for respiratory comfort.
