Per reports she was complaining of headache this morning.
Of note her CXR demonstrated some vascular peritracheal prominence and UA demonstrated a new UTI.
Ms. [**Known lastname 9149**] initial trouble began [**2111-7-26**] when she fell down some stairs leading to a basilar skull fracture and R subdural hematoma.
She underwent a craniotomy  for evacuation of the hemorrhage and R temporal lobectomy.
On POD #5 she developed L arm and face twitching lasting 5-10 minutes.
She had been on prophylactic Dilantin and initially Keppra was added to her regimen for seizure control.
She was found to have a new right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage and was observed and evaluated for possible syncope.
There was no mention of gait unsteadiness in the documentation, but dilantin toxicity may have been contributing to her falls at that time.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the epilepsy service after she had a breakthrough seizure at her rehab facility.
She was found to have a urinary tract infection.
Her seizure was likely a result both the infection and her low dilantin level.
Because of her recent falls, it was decided that dilantin might be contributing to her instability, so this medication was not restarted.
She had no further seizures during the hospitalization and an routine EEG showed no epileptiform events.
She was evaluated by PT and OT who recommended rehab for further treatment of her gait and balance difficulties.
At discharge, her neurological exam was remarkable for some tangential thinking and mild gait instability requiring a walker.
However, on speaking with her cousins they deny recent fever or chills.
No night sweats.
She has had recent weight loss and refusal to eat.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.

She had no seizures while she was here.
A routine EEG revealed epileptiform discharges from the right parietal region.
She had no seizures during her admission.
Her intraparenchymal hemorrhage is likely secondary to a fall.
ID:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was found to have a urinary tract infection with proteus mirabilis on admission and is s/p three days of IV ceftriaxone.
It may be that her concurrent infection may have caused her to be encephalopathic and fall.
Psych:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] had some agitation initially.
9. chlorpromazine 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for agitation.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because of a fall.
