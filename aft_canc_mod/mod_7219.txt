He has also had new onset of orthopnea and is now sleeping in a recliner.
He reports generalized weakness since Saturday.
He reports orthostatic symptoms, dizziness when getting up out of chair.
He has no documented coronary artery disease but had an exercise treadmill test with nuclear imaging in [**2140-1-7**] with moderate reversible inferior perfusion defect.
His last echocardiogram was also in [**2140-10-6**] with left atrial enlargement, normal ejection fraction, minimal aortic stenosis, one plus mitral regurgitation, one plus tricuspid regurgitation.
He reports not feeling greatly shortness of breath at that time and that the Lasix was started for radiographic findings rather than symptoms.
His dose was increased over the weekend because of this progressive shortness of breath and he was told to go to the Emergency Room on Monday if he did not improve.
The bleeding is small in amount and chronic.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denies fevers, chills, headache, upper respiratory infection symptoms or cough.
He does have a chronic intermittent right upper quadrant pain, especially after eating.
He denies diarrhea, constipation, or straining; no dysuria.
A nasogastric lavage showed bilious fluid.
He was noted to be in atrial flutter with a controlled rate.
Pancreatic cancer first diagnosed in [**2142-1-6**], after presenting with painless jaundice and acholic stools.
His CT scan showed a pancreatic mass.
He had metastatic lesions to the liver with near complete portal vein obstruction, mild ductal dilatation of the common bile duct and intrahepatic duct, ascites on a CT scan from [**2142-4-5**].
Prostate cancer diagnosed six years ago status post radiation therapy.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
Heart is regular rate and rhythm, I/VI high pitched systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border, no gallop.
No percussion tenderness or rebound.
Extremities had no edema.
Chest x-ray showed bibasilar atelectasis, no pneumonia.
An EKG showed atrial flutter with a rate in the 100s.
Normal axis, but [**Street Address(2) 2914**] depressions in V4 through V6 with T wave inversions and no evidence of heart strain.
He had a chest CT scan with angiography done which showed multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli and possible pulmonary metastatic disease.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 59 year old male with a recently diagnosed pancreatic cancer who presents with shortness of breath found to have pulmonary emboli on chest CT scan, also with concurrent bright red blood per rectum.
PULMONARY:  The patient had multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli.
The patient was also seen to have a question of a pneumonia based on a follow-up chest x-ray.
For his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the patient was continued on Salmeterol inhalers, ipratropium inhalers and fluticasone inhalers.
Thus, it was thought that he was likely having these bleeds secondary to radiation proctitis.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had a history of presumed coronary artery disease as he had had a prior positive stress test in the past and has been placed on Imdur to prevent any symptoms of chest pain.
The patient demonstrated atrial flutter and he had been on Diltiazem to help control his rate.
No further changes were made.
He was ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
The patient has a history of hypercholesterolemia and was continued on Atorvastatin.
