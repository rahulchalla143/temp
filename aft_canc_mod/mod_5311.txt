Three enhancing lesions in the brain compatible with metastatic disease.
Suggestion of leptomeningeal seeding by location of 1 or 2 of these lesions.
Other nonspecific white matter FLAIR abnormalities in the periventricular white matter as well as the left brachium pontis.
No evidence for obstruction or ileus.
No intraperitoneal free air or pneumatosis.
CXR [**12-3**]: IMPRESSION: Development of pleural effusions and volume loss in the left lower lobe.
Brief Hospital Course: 76-year-old woman with recently diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma with mediastinal node mets, history of protein-losing enteropathy, presented with seizure from home, found to have likely new brain mets.
Plan: # Seizure with altered mental status: Most likely from new brain lesion, which is concerning for brain mets from her lung ca.
MRI showed 3 enhancing lesions c/w metastases.
# Lung cancer: Recent transbronchial biopsy of mediastinal node revealed adenocarcinoma.Biopsy of spinal lesion revealed no tumor and now with new brain mets/ stage IV.
# Right lower extremity DVT: bilateral LENIs showed DVT and IVC filter was placed.
Anticoagulation was not started as patient is at risk for bleed with new brain mets.
# Possible pneumonia: with opacity in RUL, concerning for aspiration in the setting of seizure.
Patient does have a history of MRSA bacteremia and VRE from abdominal wound.
Mrs [**Last Name (STitle) **] remained afebrile and was transitioned to PO cefpodoxime and completed a 7 day course of antibiotics.
# Atrial fibrillation: Remained in sinus rhythm.
Hold off on warfarin given risk of intracranial bleeding.
# Protein-losing enteropathy: most recently on TPN in [**2191-5-26**].
# Code:  DNR/DNI .

Secondary: * Lung cancer: adenocarcinoma * Atrial fibrillation.
* h/o protein-losing enteropathy requiring TPN.
* h/o recurrent small bowel obstructions requiring exploratory laparoscopic lysis of adhesions and ileocecal bypass.
Discharge Condition: Good, tolerating POs   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after having a seizure and found to have a brain mass from your lung cancer.
Initially you required mechanical ventilation due to your change in mental status.
You were also found to have a blood clot in your leg and a filter was placed to protect against the blood clot from traveling to your lungs.
In addition, you were diagnosed with pneumonia and completed a course of antibiotics.
