Left frontal rounded hyperdensity suspicious for a hemorrhagic mass lesion such as a metastasis and right subdural hematoma, better visualized on the reference CT examination from [**2172-5-14**] at 12:37 p.m. from [**Hospital6 2561**].
Minimally displaced comminuted nasal bone fracture with neighboring soft tissue contusion.
1-mm hyperdense focus abutting the lateral aspect of the left globe (3:31) may represent a foreign body.
No retrobulbar soft tissue abnormalities.
Moderate ethmoid and trace maxillary and sphenoid sinus disease.
Mild rotation of C1 on C2, as seen on the reference CT C spine.
Acute bilateral anterior rib fractures with subjacent mild pulmonary contusions.
3.1 x 2.6 cm enhancing right lower outer breast mass, suspicious for malignancy, with left supraclavivular, bilateral axillary, mediastinal, and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
3 mm right upper lobe nodule warrants attention to this region on followup examinations.
Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
Multiple sub-cm hypodensities within the liver, not fully characterized on this exam.
Superior right parietal intraparenchymal hematoma is more diffuse than on the prior study with increased edema and new 4-mm leftward shift of normally midline structures.
A more inferior right parietal and the left frontal intraparenchymal hematomas are unchanged.
Edema in the lower right parietal region has increased since [**72**]:37pm with new 4 mm leftward shift of normally midline structures and complete effacement of the right lateral ventricle occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
If clinically indicated and feasible, MRI could be performed to evaluate for underlying mass lesions in the setting of right breast mass and lymphadenopathy seen on CT Torso [**2172-5-14**].
New intraventricular blood in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
Unchanged left parafalcine and small right frontal subdural hematomas.
[**2172-5-15**] CT head - In comparison to study obtained 10 hours prior, there is no significant change in small right frontal subdural hematoma, left parafalcine hematoma and intraventricular hemorrhage.
Intraparenchymal areas of hyperattenuation with extensive vasogenic edema, likely represents a combination of traumatic injury and hypercellular/hemorrhagic intracranial lesion, which also appear unchanged since prior exam.
Brief Hospital Course: 85F s/p MVC w/ R SDH w/ shift, nasal bone fx, b/l rib fractures w/ contusions, and ?L globe FB, incidentally found advanced metastatic CA, likely breast was admitted to the TICU for management of her multiple injuries.
The tachycardia improved as she was resuscitated with crystal and blood products during her stay in the TICU.
The foley was removed on HD 3 and she was voiding without difficulty.
The pt was seen by the Heme/onc team who reported that the cause of her anemia and thrombocytopenia was from either primary hematologic process or secondary to diffuse metastatic disease likely from a breast primary; incidental findings of a large breast lesion, diffuse lymphadenopathy and a liver lesion were identified.
Left frontal intraparenchymal hematoma and right subdural hematoma with 4mm shift 2.
Minimally displaced comminuted nasal bone fracture 3.
Bilateral pulmonary contusions 5.
Thrombocytopenia 6.
Anemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital following a motor vehicle collision during which you sustained multiple injuries including a right subdural hematoma, left intraparenchymal hemorrhage, nasal bone fracture, multiple rib fractures and bilateral pulmonary contusions.
Additionally, a lesions were identified within your breast and liver, which you did not wish to further discuss with Hematology/ Oncology.
