Mesenteric/splenic arteriograms with coil and Gelfoam embolization of pseudoaneurysm/transected vessel arising from the inferior pole branch of splenic artery.
[**2169-5-8**]: Evacuation and drainage of infected perisplenic hematoma with placement of the VAC.
History of Present Illness: The patient is a 55 year old Mandarin-speaking male, who presented with epigastric pain 1 year ago and decreased appetite.
He was referred for EGD on [**2169-3-20**] (performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 31960**] which was revealing for a circumferential 2cm mass at the cardia, the scope was able to traverse the mass.
Biopsy of the mass returned poorly differential adenocarcinoma.
Biopsy of the GJ junction revealed focal intestinal metaplasia most likely secondary to Barrett's, and antral biopsy showed chronic active gastritis with organisms consistent with H.Pylori.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient with biopsy proven gastric adenocarcinoma was admitted to the Surgical Oncology Service for elective total gastrectomy.
On [**2169-4-5**], the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, full mobilization of the stomach and porta hepatis with D1 lymphadenectomy, total gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy and placement of J-tube, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO/NGT, on IV fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter, and epidural catheter for pain control.
The patient continued to have severe post operative pain and epidural was removed on POD # 2, patient was started on Dilaudid PCA with IV Toradol with good effect and adequate pain control.
PCA was discontinued on POD # 5, the patient's pain was controlled with IV Dilaudid prn.
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint with episodes of intermittent tachycardia though to be secondary for pain.
The patient's tachycardia continued to persist throughout hospitalization and he was started on IV Metoprolol with good effect.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
On POD # 5, patient underwent upper GI study which was negative for leak and his diet was advanced to sips of clears on POD # 6.
The patient subsequently voided without problem.
ID/Infected Hematoma: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Wound was evaluated daily and on POD # 5 blanching erythema was noticed around incision.
Prior discharge, On POD # 7, patient spiked low grade fever, his blood and urine were sent to microbiology and they were negative.
He continued to spike fever and CT was obtained on [**2169-4-15**].
CT demonstrated  Perisplenic and left flank fluid collections concerning for hemorrhage, likely due to splenic laceration, the perisplenic and left flank fluid collections were rim-enhancing suggestive of infection.
On [**4-17**], patient's HCT dropped from 30 to 26 and patient's tachycardia increased to 150 s. The patient underwent abdominal CTA on [**4-18**], which demonstrated anterior aspect splenic artery pseudoaneurysm and increased parasplenic hematoma.
The patient was transferred in ICU after procedure secondary to tachycardia.
The patient received 8 units of pRBC and 4 units of Plasma during and post procedure, his post transfusion HCT was 38.1.
On [**4-25**] repeat Upper GI swallowing test was negative for leak and TF was restarted.
IR drain was removed on [**2169-4-27**], patient started to have bloody bowel movements, his abdominal pain increased and GI was consulted.
Repeat abdominal CT on [**4-28**] demonstrated decreased rim-enhancing perisplenic hematoma concerning for continued infection and sigmoid colon thickening suggestive of colitis.
Patient's HCT was stable and no intervention were required at that time.
Abdominal pain continued to increase and on [**4-30**] patient underwent IR guided left flank collection drainage with 12  French pigtail catheter insertion, fluid was sent for microbiology.
Gram stain was positive for gram negative and gram positive growth and patient was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn.
On [**2169-5-3**] patient underwent colonoscopy s/t persistent bloody BMs.
Colonoscopy demonstrated internal hemorrhoids, but no active bleeding was seen.
The patient's cultures came positive for E. Coli, Staph.
Aureus Coag positive and Enterococcus and Zosyn was changed to Cefepime.
The patient continued to have daily fevers and he developed persistent erythema around his IR drain.
On [**5-5**] patient underwent abdominal CT, which demonstrated new hematoma is seen in the left lateral abdominal wall at the insertion site of the pigtail drain, decrease in size of the perisplenic organized hematoma and questionable fistula between the descending colon and the inferior fluid collection.
The patient underwent fistulogram at the same day, which showed no evidence of perisplenic colonic fistula.
The patient continued to have persistent fever and increased left flank pain.
On [**5-8**] he underwent surgical evacuation and drainage of infected perisplenic hematoma with placement of vacuum-assisted closure device, the patient tolerated operation well.
Post op he was transferred in ICU s/t tachycardia and hypotension.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible with Physical Therapy.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating TF at goal minimal amount of the regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
