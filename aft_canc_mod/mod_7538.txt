Admission Date:  [**2127-5-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-5-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2050-4-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ace Inhibitors / Nsaids  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**] Chief Complaint:  ST-elevations on EKG, concern for STEMI at OSH  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catherization   History of Present Illness: 77 y/o woman with a PMhx of metastatic lung cancer with mets to bone & h/o malignant pleural effusion, who is transferred from [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital for cardiac catheterization after she was found to have ST-elevations in V2-6, I and aVL.
She was found to have an intertrochanteric fracture of the R hip, which was thought to be pathologic in nature.
She was found to have pansensitive Ecoli UTI.
EKG showed new ST elevations ~2mm in V2-6, I and aVL.
She had no chest pain and no new SOB.
(CTA did, however, show large R pleural effusion, which is old and has been malignant on prior taps.
In the cardiac cath lab at [**Hospital1 18**], there were no significant coronary lesions on angio.
Notably, her LV-gram showed severe anterolateral, apical, and inferoapical hypokinesis w/ LVEF 20%.
She had markedly depressed cardiac index (1.8), elevated wedge (34), and moderate pulm HTN.
During the cath, the patient became confused and agitated.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Mild bibasilar crackles.
No HSM or tenderness.
No femoral bruits.
Pulses: Right: DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: DP 2+ PT 2+   Pertinent Results: OSH CXR: large right pleural effusion and atelectasis, mass right upper lobe .
CT scan of chest [**5-7**]: large right side pleural effusion, mass like consolidation in right upper lobe and portion of right mid lobe.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2127-5-6**] demonstrated: 50% LMCA lesion     RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2127-5-9**] 8:56 AM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: Please eval for SDH or e/o mets.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 77 year old woman with known stage IV lung CA s/p cardiac cath.
Mental status changes.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please eval for SDH or e/o mets.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: contrast w/ cath already today  HISTORY: 77-year-old female with known stage IV lung cancer status post cardiac catheterization, now with altered mental status.
COMPARISON: No prior exam is available for comparison.
CT HEAD: Hypodensity involving right posterior frontal subcortical white matter along the superior convexity is noted; while this may represent old ischemic change, no prior imaging is available to establish stability and this may represent edema surrounding a metastatic lesion in this patient with known stage IV lung cancer.
Note is made of mild atrophic appearance, which would be more consistent with old infarct.
There may also be a smaller region of hypodensity along the posterior left frontal region as well, along the superior convexity.
Otherwise, there is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, effacement of the basal cisterns, or infarction.
Punctate, likely extra-axial densities may represent sequelae from prior myelography versus vascular calcifications.
Mild prominence of the ventricles and extra- axial CSF spaces is consistent with age-related involutional change.
Vascular calcifications are noted along the cavernous carotid arteries.
Patient is noted to have right lens replacement.
No region of bony destruction is seen in the visualized calvarium.
IMPRESSION: Region of hypodensity along the posterior right frontal lobe along the superior convexity may represent old infarct, however edema due to underlying mass may also have this appearance.
Note is also made of a smaller region of hypodensity along the left superior convexity.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Cardiomyopathy: 77yo woman with progressive stage IV NSCLC, h/o CVA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and recent R hip fx s/p replacement & ORIF who was noted to be in sinus tach at OSH, EKG showed STE, and cardiac cath was done on arrival which was notable for absence of significant CAD and presence of hypokinesis of anterolat/apex/inferoapex with severely depressed cardiac index, concerning for Takotsubo CMP.
There is a broad hypokinesis of broad territory w/o corresponding CAD with question of Takostubo CMP.
Possible triggers may have been recent hip fx vs. stress of being in hospital.
However unclear if true stress reaction vs possibly thromboembolic event to coronaries.
ACEi were not given secondary to a history of medication intolerance.
In addition anti-coagulation therapy with warfarin was not started given her known metastatic disease.
CAD: pt does have 50% LMCA lesion on cath.
A CT head was done which showed no hemorrage or acute event, but did show ?
edema and possible mets given her lung CA.
No further intervention was felt acutely necessary.
# Pleural effusion: Pt initially had some respiratory distress.
A CXR showed loculated effusion.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 979**] - [**Location (un) 246**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Takostubo Cardiomyopathy .
Secondary Stage IV Lung Cancer   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet  You were admitted to the hospital and found to have an abnormality of your heart.
If you have any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations or other concerning symptoms please call your doctor or come to the emergency room.
