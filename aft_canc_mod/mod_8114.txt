IMMAGING:  CXR [**2186-7-20**]: There is moderate cardiomegaly.
There is no pneumonia, pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
There is mild vascular congestion.
TTE [**2186-7-20**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation around a pacer wire.
CXR [**7-21**]: FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**7-20**], there is little change.
Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists, though there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or acute pneumonia.
Multifocal diffusely distributed bilateral pulmonary nodular and ground-glass opacities, consistent with infection.
Coronary artery calcifications.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
if pulmonary Histoplasmosis, Coccidioidomycosis, Blastomycosis,       Aspergillosis or Mucormycosis is strongly suspected, contact the       Microbiology Laboratory (7-2306).
Immunoflourescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) (Final       [**2186-7-31**]):    NEGATIVE for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii)..     FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2186-7-31**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR.
GRAM POSITIVE COCCI.
All other blood cultures negative, the above culture was thought to be a contaminent    Brief Hospital Course:     Ms. [**Known lastname 81668**] is a 69 yo F with h/o insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease (baseline Cr of 1.4) and complete-heart block s/p PMM who presented to [**Hospital3 **] with one week with malaise, chills, diffuse arthralgias/myalgias and shortness of breath, found to have WBC of 95K with increased peripheral blasts, elevated creatinine to 2.4, uric acid of 16.5, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further treatment of acute leukemia.
# Acute leukemia: Peripheral blood smear showed many myeloid-appearing blasts, most likely c/w acute myeloid leukemia.
No auer rods were appreciated, no evidence of DIC clinically or in lab testing, making APL less likely.
She received two doses of rasburicase and was started on allopurinol with a decrease in uric acid from 16.8 to 0.1.
Her urine output was decreased on [**7-21**] and creatinine remained elevated at 2.7 depite continuous IVF with a 1L NS [**Last Name (LF) 1868**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] renal was consulted.
She was also started on cefepime for neutropenic prophylaxis.
She developed Tumor Lysis syndrome and Renal failure, requiring dialysis.
# TLS: Recieved rasburicase and allopurinol.
Elevated BUN/Cr and other toxins were felt to be contributing to her AMS.
# Renal failure: Was felt to be [**3-2**] tumor lysis syndrome.
However, after she failed the trial of extubation, she remained sedated and un-interactive  # Pneumonia: She developed PNA seen on CT scan in the setting of neutropenia.
This was felt to be a large contributor to her failure to extubate.
The team held multiple meetings with the patient's husband and children (most of whom attended work rounds on a daily basis) to discuss her medical problems and her wishes.
You were tranferred for further treatment of your fatigue and shortness of breath.
A bone marrow biopsy confirmed that you had acute leukemia.
