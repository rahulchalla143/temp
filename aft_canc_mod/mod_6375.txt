## Dyspnea, hypoxia: the patient presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] with CT imaging consistent with right bronchus intermedius obstruction, likely by hilar mass most consistent with a malignant process, most likely metastatic.
LDH yesterday over [**2165**], concerning for lymphoma vs carcinoma although significant smoking hx suggestive of carcinoma.
Hypoxia exacerbated by a post-obstructive pneumonia, tx with Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Metronidazole, to be discontinued on discharge.
Patient scheduled for and had rigid bronchoscopy in the OR on [**5-28**].
The hilar mass was unable to be stented, and bile was also found.
There was a question of potential biliary-pulmonary fistula.
Unfortunately, pt was intubated in the OR after an episode of A-fib with RVR, and acute respiratory distress.
Pt was then extubated on the same day after completely a spontaneous breathing trial.
Further staging of potential malignancy and evaluation of biliary-pulmonary fistula was not pursued further, because patient opted for comfort measures only.
Oncology:  Right bronchus obstruction likely [**1-2**] to mass (lymphoma vs carcinoma).
## Atrial fibrillation: Patient was in atrial fibrillation shortly after presentation to MICU, treated with Diltiazem.
At this time, CHADS2 score was 4 (hypertension, age, CVA), but given recent hempotysis and upcoming procedures, neither aspirin nor anti-coagulation was begun.
In NSR until morning of [**2176-5-26**], then had Afib with RVR again.
## Acute Renal Injury:  Increase in Creatine from 1.0 to 1.3 during admission likely secondary to a pre-renal hypovolemic process post-bronchoscopy or secondary to dye toxicity from the CT several days ago.
Acetaminophen 650 mg Suppository Sig: [**12-2**]  Rectal every four (4) hours as needed for fever or pain.
Levsin 0.125 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO q4-6h PRN as needed for Secretions.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: [**12-2**] Capsules PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Hospice Please admit to [**Hospital 2188**] on day of discharge   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Dyspnea secondary to hilar lung mass, malignant with metastasis, and post-obstructive pneumonia Secondary: -Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response -Acute renal failure, resolved -Benign prostatic hypertrophy   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were hospitalized with complaints of shortness of breath, likely due to a mass in your right lung, and a pneumonia that developed because that mass was compressing other parts of your lung.
