Admission Date:  [**2192-7-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2192-7-26**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 832**] Chief Complaint: chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC placement  History of Present Illness: Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of HTN, Type II DM, and Paget dz who presents with chest pain for two days.
Per report and the patient's family, patient was complaining of pleuritic right-sided chest pain for the past two days at rehab.
Today, she was transferred from rehab to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of both her chest pain and for monitoring her urine output in the setting of newly diagnosed bladder mass.
A chest PA and lateral was obtained with evidence of RLL.
The patient was going to be admitted to the floor, but developed a fever to 103.9.
Patient also had episode of SVT (?
a. fib) with RVR and received diltiazem 30 mg PO x 1 and 10 mg IV x 1.
She was then admitted to the ICU given concern for SVT and septic physiology.
She was discharged to rehab, evaluated by urology/urogyn, and reportedly has a "bladder mass" which requires a foley catheter to avoid obstruction.
Review of systems: Per family, did not have any other symptoms apart from pleuritic right-sided chest pain.
Pulm:  crackles at right base Abd: soft, NT, +BS.
Extremities: wwp, no edema.
Lung volumes are low and there is a right lower lobe posterior opacity.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
Note is made of bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.
[**7-21**]: REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of the patient with right lower lobe pneumonia.
There is significant interval worsening of right lower lobe consolidation, findings that are most likely consistent with interval aspiration given the rapidity of the change.
Pulmonary hemorrhage would be another possibility if the patient has clinical condition pre-disposing to that.
Right pleural effusion is noted, new.
[**7-22**] There is interval improvement of the right basal consolidation, most likely consistent with partial resolution or aspiration.
Still present left basal opacity as well as mild vascular engorgement is seen and there is bilateral pleural effusion, small to moderate.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.

RLL locale consistent with recent aspiration event.
Patient has minimal O2 requirement, but is hypoxic, likely [**1-10**] V/Q mismatch in setting of infiltrate and possible atelectasis.
Must also consider VTE given tachycardia, hypoxia, and pleuritic chest pain.
Patient was covered broadly for HCAP with vanc, cefepime, and levoflox with intent to complete 10 day course given lack of sputum sample.
[**Name (NI) **] had persistent hypotension despite multiple boluses of IVF, and family meeting was held on [**2192-7-23**].
She was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] facility with goals of comfort care with PO morphine for discomfort and pain.
# Right-sided hemiparesis- Per PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 228**] baseline SBP generally much higher than admission SBP.
Morphine Concentrate 20 mg/mL Solution Sig: [**12-10**]  PO every four (4) hours: PRN for pain, air hunger, discomfort .
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 599**] Senior Healthcare of [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis: (1) Hospital acquired pneumonia (2) Left sided stroke   Discharge Condition: Comfort goals, no PO nutrition, no IV fluids, no antibiotics.
Pain / anxiety control.
Discharge Instructions: Ms [**Known lastname 23**] was admitted for worsening chest pain and signs and symptoms concerning for sepsis and pneumonia.
Around this time she developed right sided upper extremity weakness likely consistent with new stroke.
Given her pneumonia and new stroke signs, we had a discussion with the patient's family and decided to focus on comfort for her goals of care.
