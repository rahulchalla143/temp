Admission Date:  [**2115-8-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2115-8-19**]  Date of Birth:   [**2048-9-18**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Thoracic Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66-year-old with a history of acute myeloplastic leukemia diagnosed in [**2114-10-1**] who was treated with Ara-C but complicated by infection and myelosuppression.
The patient was readmitted on [**8-9**] for an acute myeloplastic leukemia relapse.
A chest CAT scan was done on [**8-10**] which revealed a right upper lobe consolidation.
A biopsy of this consolidation showed that it was a mucoid mycosis, and consequently Thoracic Surgery was consulted on [**8-14**] to evaluate the need to resect the right upper lobe.
Questionable aspergillus pneumonia in [**2115-11-1**] which was treated with four weeks of AmBisome.
He also has a history of hypertension.
Recurrent acute myelogenous leukemia.
Prostate cancer 10 years ago.
He also has a history of asbestos exposure four years ago and possible tuberculosis exposure since he was working in a tuberculosis institute.
His head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination was significant for lymphadenopathy in the cervical and submandibular region.
No evidence of jugular venous distention or carotid bruits.
He was also noted to have palpable axillary lymph nodes including one that was significantly enlarged in the left axilla.
First heart sound and second heart sound were present.
No murmurs or gallops were appreciated.
The abdomen was soft and nontender, though moderately protuberant.
No evidence of edema.
Neurologically, he was alert and oriented, and no focal neurologic deficits were noted.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   He had a chest CT which revealed a right upper lobe opacity measuring 6.7 cm X 8.7 cm; which was increased from his previous CT scan of 4.1 cm X 4.5 cm.
There was extensive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
A CAT scan of his abdomen also showed right basilar nodules in the right base of his lung measuring approximately 8 mm.
There was also lymphadenopathy at the porta hepatis and the retroperitoneum.
A biopsy of his left axilla lymph node showed that there was no evidence of disseminated fungal infection.
Therefore, discussion with the patient as well as his family was started to determine whether or not they would wish to have this consolidation in his right upper lobe removed.
Intraoperatively, an initial attempt to remove the patient's right upper lobe appeared to be difficult, and the patient had a significant amount of blood loss intraoperatively.
Fluid boluses did not appear to help his blood pressure or his perfusion.
The patient became progressively acidotic.
Nevertheless; at 7:55 a.m. on [**2115-8-19**], the patient's blood pressure continued to drop, followed by his heart rate, and finally he became asystolic and expired at exactly 7:55 a.m. on [**2115-8-19**].
Disseminated acute myelogenous leukemia.
