He was seen in the [**Hospital **] clinic today for planned PEG tube but GI unable to place due to concern for compromising airway with sedation.
The patient's HCP also reports that he had fever last week and at dialysis 4D prior to admit ([**5-15**]) had blood cultures drawn which subsequently returned positive.

He is very withdrawn and often comes to dialysis unwashed wearing clothes he has not changed for several days.
General Appearance: cachectic, yellow bronze skin tone, NAD, non toxic Eyes:  EOMI, no conjuctival injection, anicteric ENT:  MMdry, poor dentition, palpable posterior cerv lymph node Respiratory: CTA b/l with good air movement throughout Cardiovascular: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, +2/6 systolic murmur Gastrointestinal: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, scaphoid Musculoskeletal/extremities: no edema Skin/nails: warm, no rashes/yellowish skin tone Neurological: AAOx3.
Psychiatric:pleasant, appropriate affect Heme/Lymph: posterior cervical adenopathy GU: no catheter in place LEFT AV FISTULA with bruit.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest c/w a small secundum atrial septal defect.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear minimally thickened with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
A very small fluttering echodensity is suggested on the posterior mitral leaflet and coaptation of the mitral leaflets (clips 13, 14).
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2166-10-21**], left ventricular systolic function is now depressed (global), the mitral leaflets are thickened with a possible vegetation and mild mitral regurgitation is present.
A small secundum type atrial septal defect is also identified.

HISTORY: 54-year-old man with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with vigorous bacteremia dialysis, rule out pneumonia.
FINDINGS:  New diffuse infiltrates are seen in both right and left lung, more severe on the right side predominantly in the right upper and middle lobe.
There is no pleural effusion.
New bilateral pulmonary infiltrates worrisome for atypical pneumonia.

evidence septic emboli/pneumonia CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: dialysis  HISTORY: 54-year-old male with endocarditis and unclear pulmonary process.
Diffuse coronary atherosclerotic calcifications are noted.
There is no hilar adenopathy.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Milder opacities in the right lung base are unchanged.
Punctate calcifications are noted in the spleen which likely represent calcified granulomas.
Extensive calcifications are noted along the abdominal aorta and along the splenic artery.
No region of bony destruction is seen concerning for malignancy or infection.
Resolving left predominantly lower lobe infiltrate which may be infectious or inflammatory in nature.
Mild patchy opacities in the right lower lung is unchanged.
Mediastinal lymph nodes unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: This is 54 a year-old man with Type I dm, CKD stage V and recently diagnosed squamous cell cancer of head and neck admitted for multiple complaints.
1)Bacteremia/endocarditis 2)Squamous Cell Carcinoma of pharynyx 3)Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, consistent with aspiration pneumonia 4)DM1 with complications and poorly controlled 5)CKD stage V on hemodialysis 6)Anemia chronic kidney disease 7)hypertension, well controlled on current medications 8)malnutrition -- at goal on tube feeds 9)hypothyroidism   During hospitalization, pt.
Found to have bacteremia on blood cultures drawn on [**5-15**] at dialysis center.
Afebrile throughout.
Radiation evaluated him for treatment of squamous cell carcinoma and completed mapping, with plan for first treatment on [**6-11**].
For pulmonary infiltrates, received chest CT on [**5-23**] which demonstrated interval improvement and no clear evidence of septic emboli, and initially received azithromycin for coverage of atypical organisms completed, along with vancomycin, as above.
aspirated after vomiting, and developed a new lll infiltrate consistent with pneumonitis, and required high flow oxygen to maintain oxygen sats in the 90s subsequent to this.
He was transfered to the ICU after spiking a fever and with radiographic evidence of bilateral aspiration pneumonia.
His mental status improved gradually, and by discharge he was no longer noncompliant or agitated, and per family was near baseline.
Pneumonia was felt to be aspiration, and he completed a seven day course of cipro/flagyl with radiologic and clinical improvement.
Swallow evaluation [**6-5**] showed silent aspiration but with counseling and observation he tolerated soft foods and thin liquids.
He was anxious to expand his diet, but was witnessed to have problems with aspiration when he eats more solid food.
On [**6-6**], the morning after receiving dexamethasone premedication for erbitux, he developed severe hyperglycemia, unresponsive to large doses of SC insulin.
His diet was advanced to soft solids and even some regular food items (chicken pot pie, cheeseburger), with no observed aspiration.
Acetaminophen 160 mg/5 mL Solution [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1)  PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
Head and neck cancer (pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, non-operable) 2.
Endocarditis with MSSA and streptococcal species most likely due to poor dentition and resultant bacteremia 4. aspiration pneumonia 5. end stage renal disease on hemodialysis 6. s/p extraction of all teeth due to severe caries and gingival disease 7. s/p surgical placement of gastrostomy tube   Discharge Condition: Stable, very cachectic, afebrile, edentulous, G-tube, no permenent or semi-permanent intravenous access, left arm AV fistula.
Discharge Instructions: Return to the [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Department for: Fevers over 101 F, altered mental status, erythema or exudate from G-tube, difficulty breathing, or any other alarming symptoms.
