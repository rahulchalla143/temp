Admission Date:  [**2194-2-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2194-2-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2139-11-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**] Chief Complaint: Metabolic encephalopathy.
Briefly, he is a 54-year-old man with a h/o recurrent GBM, s/p resection, XRT, and chemotherapy.
His treatmetn was complicated by pulmonary embolism, seizure, and steroid myopathy resulting in frequent falls who presented to clinic today with increased somnolence and episodes of syncope.
He was then directly admitted after CT angiogram was negative for pulmonary embolism and MRI of the head was performed.
His wife explains that he has had progressive weakness, mainly in his bilateral lower extremities, over the past 2 weeks.
Wife reports that while he was being moved, he had loss of consciousness for minutes.
There was no evidence of seizure activity.
His wife also reports incontinence with his loss of consciousness episodes; one episode was witnessed by EMT's and they reported no evidence of seizure activity, just loss of consciousness for several minutes.
Since his initiation in the trial, his mental status and weakness has become worse.
Labs revealed severe hypokalemia and hyponatremia and he was transferred to MICU for closer monitoring.
After that, he was dizzy, forgetful, and had blurry vision for a few days.
He had a head CT that showed a mass in the left parietal white matter.
- [**2193-7-29**] tumor returned on surveillance head MRI seizure on [**2193-7-8**], started on Depakote at 1,500 mg po twice daily pulmonary embolism after 3 cycles of monthly temozolomide, on Coumadin, started on Lasix for pedal edema - s/p 2 monthly cycles of metronomic temozolomide at 75 mg/m2/day - s/p Cyberknife radiosurgery to recurrence in the left occipital lobe cavity - started Xerecept protocol on [**2194-1-24**] - Keppra at 1,500 mg po 3 times daily, pedal edema requiring Lasix and Zaroxylyn  Past Medical History: Ophthalmic zoster (left V1 distribution) Severe burns (child) requiring skin grafting to his left leg  Social History: He works as a painter at [**State 1558**] at [**Location (un) 5169**].
Family History: His mother had hypertension, and both parents died of myocardial infarction.
One brother has hypertension while a sister had breast cancer that was treated.
PULMONARY: Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or crackles.
EXTREMITIES: He has 1+ LE edema and 2+ doralis pedis pulses.
Visual field examination is notable for a right hemianopsia.
Motor Examination:  He does not have a drift.
His muscle strengths are [**4-19**] at all muscle groups, except for weakness in the proximal lower extremities at 4-/5.
Pertinent Results: [**2194-2-5**] CTA Chest No evidence of pulmonary embolism, thoracic aortic dissection, pneumonia.
[**2194-2-5**] MRI Head No significant change from [**2194-1-16**] with nodular areas of enhancement which presumably represent residual tumor surrounding the postoperative cavity in the left parietooccipital region.
There is no significant interval change in the surrounding T2 hyperintensity as above.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 54-year-old right-handed man with a h/o recurrent GBM, s/p resection, XRT, chemotherapy.
His treatment is complicated by pulmonary embolism, seizure, and steroid myopathy resulting in frequent falls who presented to clinic on [**2194-2-5**] with increased somnulence, weakness, and episodes of syncope.
(1) Somnolence/Encephalopathy: The patient's somnolence and encephalopthy on admission were most likely secondary to his initial metabolic abnormalities as well as his underlying GBM and recently decreased steroids.
With correction of metabolic abnormalities, mental status did not improved significantly.
He was restarted on Decadron with further improvement of his energy level and return to his baseline mental status (awake and oriented x 2).
(3) Hyponatremia: Etiology was most likely secondary to hypovolemic hyponatremia from poor PO intake and diuretic use.
(4) History of Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's INR was elevated on admission (likely due to poor PO intake causing alteration of gut flora), therefore his Coumadin was held until [**2194-2-9**] when her was restarted on his prior regimen (5 mg 4x/week and 4 mg 3x/week).
Further management will be per primary oncologist  (6) Steroid Myopathy: The patient was evaluated and treated by PT and will be discharged to rehabilitation for further therapy.
Fingersticks Please check blood glucose by fingerstick QID  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 19504**] of [**Location (un) 30940**] - [**Location (un) 30940**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Hypokalemia and hyponatremia  Secondary: Glioblastoma multiforme Steroid myopathy Depression  Discharge Condition: Stable, tolerating POs, stabilized on medication regimen, and appropriate follow up arranged.
Please seek immediate medical care if you develop changes in mental status including increasing somnulance, increasing confusion, worsening weakness, or any other concerning symptom.
