[**2191-11-24**] bone marrow biopsy Precursor B- Acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
In the absence of localized symptoms or clinical suspicion for cholecystitis, asymmetric gallbladder wall edema at the liver edge likely represents a component of liver disease which may include acute hepatitis or hypoalbuminemia.
[**2191-11-28**] liver biopsy Sections are of liver parenchyma with a patchy dense lymphoid infiltrate composed of medium-sized lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm, round-to-irregular nuclei, pale chromatin and occasional small nucleoli.
BCL-1 is predominantly negative with rare cells staining.
The fragment has no connection with the subclavian line whose tip projects over the proximal parts of the right atrium.
[**2191-11-30**] ECHO small tricuspid valve/chordal mass vs focal thickening/redundancy of the valve; vegetation cannot be excluded; consider transesophageal echocardiography for (possibly) better visualization  [**2191-12-2**] ECHO Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.

There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
A small pericardial effusion is now present.
There is a very small residual pericardial effusion.

The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No acute intracranial process.
Focal area of hypodensity in the territory of right PCA likely related to old ischemic event.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Two right pulmonary nodules measuring 2 and 4 mm respectively, in light of the history of smoking, a 12-month followup CT is suggested to assess for stability.
Apparent gallbladder wall thickening which is most likely secondary to underdistension.
Deep vein thrombosis in the right subclavian vein which extends to the right axillary vein and more superficial right brachial vein, without significant change from prior study.
Interval increase in small thrombus involving the basilic vein, when compared to prior study ([**2191-12-30**]).
Presented with 4-6 weeks fatigue and bruising and initial WBC 14 with 73% lymphoblasts and plt 6), s/p removal of IR apparatus from R atrium/ventricle [**11-28**] following transjugular liver bx and echo showed some clot after this.
Had worsening chest tightness and shortness of breath and increasing pulsus paradoxus in context of low ECG voltage and large heart on CXR.
Had emergent echo showing pericardial tamponade and went for drainage and to CCU post drainage of  400ml blood (Hct 25) .
Back to BMT unit and doing well but still had large L>>R pleural effusions which resolved as patient was auto-diuresing.
Unexplained tachyardia on telemetry with episodes of vasovagal syncopal episodes resulting in several collapses - PE/recurrent pericardial effusion and other serious causes ruled out and cardiology reviewed.
Recurrent vasovagals and tachycardia and seen by neurology who suggested compression stockings / trial of midodrine.
She Initially presented as a referral from PCP to emergency department for anemia with Hgb of 7.0, Hct 19, platelets of 6, WBC 10.7.
Results c/w PHL+ pre-B cell ALL, also had elevated AST and ALT, which was evaluated by livery biopsy that showed hepatic involvement with leukemia (c/b dislodged IR catheter, see below for details).
There was concern for CNS involvement as 2 WBCs in CSF were suspicious for leukemic cells.
She had IT cytarabine [**12-9**] and [**12-30**] and IT methotrexate [**12-16**] and [**12-23**].. She had a profound neutropenia and thrombocytopenia which resolved.
At the time of further IT chemo [**12-16**], further samples sent for cytology and flow cytometry with no evidence eof leukemic cells.
Started GCSF [**12-19**] for persistently low counts and stopped [**12-22**].
Rpt BMBx [**12-23**] - no disease.
# Elevated LFTs: followed by hepatology during admission, on liver biopsy [**12-29**] was secondary to leukemic infiltration (see CCU course for liver bx complications).
In the next weeks there was evidence of slow deterioration and a possible drug cause was postulated.
# Liver biopsy with complication requiring IR intervention: During her liver biopsy, IR dislodged a 7cm catheter in her right atrium and were unable to retrieve it.
CT showed catheter extending across tricuspid valve to the RV.
On arrival to the CCU floor, the patient was complaining of severe back pain, no chest pain.
The patient had no ectopy or arrhtymia overnight and HCT remained stable.
#Pericardial effusion post drain: ECG after [**11-29**] showed low voltages and she became symptomatic on [**12-5**].
At this point her ECG showed even lower voltages (when compared with previous ECGs) and had a large heart on CXR.
On [**12-6**] the patient was found to have a pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade physiology in setting of chest pain, SOB, decreased voltage on ECG, and a pulsus paradoxus of 15mmHg.
Symptoms improved and pt remained hemodynamically stable with no chest pain after procedure.
Pericardial effusion was felt likely iatrogenic following catheter penetration of ventricle from prior liver bx accident.
Flow cytometry of sample negative for malignant cells.
Post procedure there was trivial residual effusion on removing drain.
Following transfer back to the BMT unit, she remained stable in regard to her pericrdial effusion and pulsus between 6 and 8mmHg throughout.
She was auto-diuresing and echo on [**12-12**] showed no change.
Imatinib was initially held due to concerns for precipitating effusions and was only restarted after MTX (as Part B) was cleared and re-comenced [**12-31**].
Repeat ECHOs on [**12-22**] and [**1-3**] showed no significant effusion remaining.
# Unexplained tachycardia: Initially considered PE although low prob, PE ruled out by CT-PA. Further syncope on [**12-21**] in setting of tachycardia up to 143 on minimal exertion.
Echo [**12-22**] showed a trival pericardial effusion with no echocardgiographic evidence of tamponade and compared with the prior echo, the pericardial effusion had essentially resolved.
# Syncopal episodes: Syncope while in shower [**12-17**].
old infarct but no RFs and would be unlikely - MRI not clinically indicated at present.
Pt triggered again on [**1-6**] for SBP in 80s but pt was asymptomatic (no dizziness).
# Bilateral pleural effusions: Now resolved.
Initially large L and small R. If becomes acutely SOB may have to be tapped and for urgent CXR or if spikes fever.
#Rash: Maculopapular rash was noted only on her back on [**12-12**].
Dermatology consulted [**12-13**] who felt that this was miliaria rubra and not concerning and not drug rash and required no treatment.
Because of hypotension ativan decreased to 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **].
# Low grade fever (max 100.3 - 100.1 on [**12-10**]) in context of neutropenia: IV cefepime and vanc started on [**12-6**].
She had no true fevers and counts improved by [**12-22**] at which point antibiotics were discontinued.
# RUE DVT: Unilateral swollen R arm with PICC - went on to U/S and showed clot extending from subclavian to brachial vein - for anticoagulation with enoxaparin post LP on [**12-31**] and to hold LMWH if Plt <50.
Repeat US on [**2192-1-12**] showed remaining clot but was non-occlusive; per att recs, pt was not restarted on lovenox.
# Incidental finding: CT-PA [**12-21**] showed two right pulmonary nodules measuring 2 and 4 mm respectively, in light of the history of smoking, a 12-month followup CT is suggested to assess for stability.

Secondary: Pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade requiring drainage Hypotension Syncope Upper extremity DVT, non-occlusive, catheter-associated  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Your course of treatment was  complicated by elevated levels of liver enzymes.
It was was found that there was some leukemic infiltration of the liver; your liver enzymes also were elevated because of drugs that were needed to treat your cancer as well.
You also had a procedural complication requiring interventional radiology to remove a dislodged catheter.
You had a pericardial effusion causing tamponade (or fluid or blood in the sac surround the heart) resulted in decreased ability of the heart to pump blood forward to the rest of your body.
You also experienced episodes of faintness and low blood pressure.
You feeling of faintness resolved but you continued to have low blood pressures.
You were seen by neurology and cardiology and no acute cause could be identified.
You responded well to additional fluids and, although your blood pressure is at times low, you have not had anymore episodes of fainting or dizziness for over a week.
You had a DVT in your arm from a catheter.
The following changes were made you your medications: - Please decrease your dose of lorazepam to 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **]; this was reduced because of your low blood pressures.
- Please decrease your dose of paroxetine to 30mg daily (rather than twice daily) - Please use olanzapine 5 mg twice daily as needed for anxiety - Please START taking omeprazole 40mg daily.
