Patient was recently admitted to the OMED service 4/22-24/09 with tachycardia and hypotension thought related to dehydration.
[**Name (NI) 1094**] son reports that his cough improved, but he gradually developed increasing lower extremity edema and abdominal swelling.
Associated symptoms include worsening mental status and fatigue.
His exam was notable for increased edema and ascites.
His labs were notable for hyponatremia with a sodium of 103, elevated lactate to 6.6, and hyperkalemia to 5.5.
Prostate cancer [**2183**] s/p resection 2.
Hypertension 3.
Atrial fibrillation off coumadin 4.
Thalaseemia 5.
Metastatic pancreatic cancer   Social History: - Home: lives at home with wife and daughter [**Name (NI) **]; moved here from [**Country 651**] in [**2168**] - Occupation: worked in hotels and supermarkets - EtOH: Denies - Drugs: Denies - Tobacco: Denies  Family History: Denies any history of cancer in the family.
Physical Exam: T 97.4, HR 82, BP 105/55, RR 19, O2sat 99%RA Gen: Somnolent male difficult to arouse from sleep but in NAD HEENT: Clear OP, MMM NECK: Supple, No LAD, No JVD CV: RR, NL rate.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops LUNGS: Anterior breath sounds notable for rales at right base and diminished breath sounds at left base.
ABD: Soft, nl BS, mildly distended, unable to appreciate fluid wave EXT: 2+ pitting LE edema extending to lower back and 1+ of upper extremities b/l.
2+ DP pulses BL SKIN: No lesions NEURO: Arousable but not oriented.
[**2189-3-29**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation, ST-T changes are nonspecific, Since previous tracing of [**2189-3-18**], T wave flattening noted.
[**2189-3-29**] CXR: Increasing left effusion/consolidation.
[**2189-3-29**] CT Abd/Pelvis: - Marked interval progression of metastatic disease as detailed above with increased disease burden in the pancreas, liver and diffuse implants in the abdomen.
- Stable multiple hypodense lesions in both kidneys.
- Minimal ascites.
Moderate anasarca.
- Small nonobstructing bilateral renal calculi.
[**2189-3-29**] CT Head: No acute intracranial process.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 yo man with history of metastatic pancreatic cancer was admitted with dyspnea, new ascites, and profound hyponatremia.
# Hyponatremia: Profound hyponatremia likely etiology of altered mental status with improvement in lethargy with cautious correction.
However, per renal assessment, appears to have baseline mild SIADH exacerbated by excessive po fluid intake at home due to diagnosis of dehydration given at last admission.
# Hypotension: Per Renal, likely new baseline in setting of progressive chronic disease.
Ddx hypovolemia given tachycardia but little response to fluid boluses.
Initial concern of hypoperfusion given elevated lactate but persistence of lactate likely [**12-29**] to malignancy.
# Dyspnea: Infiltrate on CXR initially treated as HAP with vanco and zosyn.
Rapid respiratory viral Ag test negative.
Prior to discharge, switched to cefpodoxime as MRSA screen negative and low clinical suspicion for pseudomonas pneumonia.
Small bilateral effusions on imaging (ddx parapneumonic v. malignancy) may also have contributed to dyspnea.
# Bandemia: Likely [**12-29**] pneumonia, stable to mildly improved.
# Guaiac positive stools: Patient was found to have guiac positive stools, likely related to his history of GI cancer and it is unclear if he has any GI tract involvement of his cancer.
In light of guiac positive stools, held off on any anticoagulation at this time.
# Splenic Vein Thrombosis Patient has newly diagnosed splenic vein thrombosis.
Unclear if this represents a spontaneous thrombosis or is related to tumor invasion.
Family made aware of diagnosis, but anticoagulation held as pt is poor candidate given his poor PO intake, multiple comorbidities, and reported allergy to coumadin.
# Fluid overload: [**Month (only) 116**] be [**12-29**] increased metastatic disease, low albumin.
[**Month (only) 116**] have some diastolic dysfunction not assessed on prior echo.
Nephrotic syndrome unlikely given U/A.
of new ascites which is likely related to his increased metastatic disease.
# Metastatic pancreatic Cancer: Evidence of progression of CT abdomen/pelvis.
Of note, OB positive stool seen in the setting of known GI malignancy but with relatively stable Hct.
# Nutrition: Speech & swallow and Nutrition recommended high protein, pureed solids, nectar-thick liquids.
# DVT ppx: Pneumoboots.
Disp:*1600 mg* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary - Hyponatremia - Hospital acquired pneumonia Secondary - Metastatic pancreatic cancer - Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for increasing cough and lethargy.
You were also found to have a very low sodium level.
This is thought to be due to an underlying metabolic problem which was exacerbated by too much water intake at home.
Please seek medical attention if you develop fevers or chills, increased difficulty breathing, chest pain, or any other concerning symptoms.
