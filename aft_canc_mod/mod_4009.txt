Admission Date:  [**2150-3-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2150-4-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2069-2-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**] Chief Complaint: 81 M w/ esophageal CA  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Thoracoscopic and laparoscopic total esophagogastrectomy.
History of Present Illness: 81 M who had been recently healthy, but has a long history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, benign esophageal stricture and Barrett's esophagus.
Recently he was found to have an invasive adenocarcinoma of the esophagus within a thickened nodule located approximately 37 cm from the incisors.
A limited EUS demonstrated an area of thickening measuring 5-6 mm, but due to technical difficulties in performing the EUS, an accurate EUS staging could not be performed.
There was no obvious lymph nodal involvement.
A PET scan demonstrated mild activity within the esophagus, but no activity within paraesophageal lymph nodes.
There was activity within a left anterior hilar lymph node, which we biopsied last week and showed no evidence of cancer.
He is, therefore, taken forward for a minimally invasive esophagogastrectomy.
Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant only for gastroesophageal reflux disease, which has been treated with over-the-counter Prilosec.
He denies any cardiovascular, respiratory or GI problems.
He used to make concrete forms for foundations.

There is a minimal (1 mm) right apical pneumothorax  at the tip of the right chest tube.
No pleural effusion.
There is subcutaneous air at the  right lateral chest.
Within the imaged portion of the abdomen, there is  evidence of free air within the abdomen as evidenced by air on both sides of a  small bowel loop.
[**2150-3-26**] Upper GI study: Status post esophagogastrectomy with gastric pull through,  without evidence of leak.
Aspiration of Conray in bilateral lower lobes mainly in right lower lobe.
The previously identified right large pneumothorax has been slightly decreased in size with remaining small right basilar pneumothorax.
There is continued mild pulmonary edema with decreased opacities in both lower lobes.
There is continued dilatation of the intrathoracic stomach.
[**2150-4-3**] CXR: There is no pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
There may be a tiny residual right pleural effusion but no pneumothorax.
Note is made of significant amount of residual in hypopharynx, as well as penetration and aspiration at multiple swallowing attempts, followed by ineffective cough.
No evidence of increased distention of the stomach since the prior film.
There is a patchy opacity consistent with atelectasis at the right lung base and to a less extent at the left lung base.
No pneumothorax.
Linear densities consistent with atelectasis and/or scarring are present in the right midzone.
Lymph node, paraesophageal, biopsy (A):  One lymph node:  No evidence of malignancy (0/1); anthracosis.
One lymph node:  No evidence of malignancy (0/1); anthracosis.
Soft tissue, subcarinal packet, excision (C-D):  Four lymph nodes:  No evidence of malignancy (0/4); anthracosis.
Invasive adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.
Nine lymph nodes:  No evidence of malignancy (0/9).
V. Stomach segmented resection (X-Z):  Corpus tissue:  No diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 81 M w/ esophageal cancer presenting to [**Hospital1 18**] for minimally invasive esophagogastrectomy.
On [**2150-3-21**] the patient had several runs of PACs/atrial fibrillation and an amiodarone drip was started.
He was started on maintenance IVF's and Lopressor was increased to 75 mg PO BID for rate control of his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
On [**2150-3-26**] the patient underwent a swallow study which was negative for leaks.
During the study he aspirated and developed bilateral pneumonitis.
He was intubated and required some pressors for hemodynamic stability.
Sputum cultures revealed S. Aureus and Serratia sensitive to Levofloxacin, which was started on [**2150-3-29**].
A ENT consultation was obtained and it was found that the patient had moderate vocal cord paralysis, for which interval followup in 1 month was recommended.
He did have a slight leukocytosis with left lower lobe atelectasis on his latest x-ray, and therefore was continued on levofloxacin as part of his outpatient regimen.
