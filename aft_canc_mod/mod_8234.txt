The patient has had multiple recent admissions.
She did not have EEG monitoring at that time but was discharged with increased dose of Keppra.
On [**3-30**] to [**4-5**] she was admitted for L sided increased weakness and concern for new semiology (sudden laugh, upper extremity and torso tightening, then head down briefly, becoming unresponsive with the event).
[**Date range (1) 111225**] readmitted for hypothermia to [**Age over 90 **] F and somnolence.
She continued to have freq tonic seizures including at least 2 GTCs that lasted 2 minutes or less with a typical post-ictal state.
[**6-1**]- at least 4 or 5 brief events with sudden laughing and nonresponsiveness during epilepsy office visit.
Staff did not note these as seizures and have witnessed many of these at home.
[**6-9**]- 8pm, eyes rolling, face stiff/distorted, head and bilateral extremities shaking, body stiffened, face red, screaming, 40 sec [**6-15**]- 2:25pm, similar to [**6-9**], 1 min 20 sec [**6-18**]- 6:30pm, eyes rolling, generalized stiffening/shaking, 15 sec with 30 sec postictal  The patient presents today because caretakers noted her to be hypotherma to 92-[**Age over 90 **] F. She had not had any infectious symptoms such as cough, SOB, rhiorrhea, congestion, sore throat, foul smelling urine, N/V/D.
She had been taking prophylactic med (methanamine) to prevent UTI for about 1 month, ending [**6-11**].
Her parents spoke to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 16883**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29298**], who recommended ED visit and likely admission given the hypothermia as well as [**3-6**] recent seizures that were either prolonged complex partial or partial with secondary generalization.
ROS: per parents No headache, change in speech or comprehension, dysphagia, new focal weakness, fevers, sweats, cough, SOB, N/V/D, abdominal pain, rash.

Refractory seizures on multiple AEDs, s/p [**Month/Day (3) 15741**];  about 5 times per month with a variety of manifestations (turns red in the face; brief movements of her eyes, brief moments of non-responsiveness).
Last generalized seizure with post-ictal period noted in OMR chart was sometime in [**Month (only) 404**], preceeded by sometime in [**Month (only) **].
Sleep apnea with obese neck; snores/wakes frequently (including for nocturia); does not tolerate CPAP.

Retrocardiac region is incompletely assessed due to obscuration by battery pack of neural stimulator.
Crowding of the vasculature and increased interstitial markings is seemingly unchanged from multiple previous examinations, likely secondary to crowding due to low lung volumes.
Cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
EEG ([**6-20**]): IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG monitoring study due to one seizure characterized clinically by behavioral arrest and electrographically by electrodecrement and fast activity over the right hemisphere.
The remainder of the study showed frequent multifocal left hemispheric epileptiform discharges mainly in the left temporal and central regions as well as occasional right central and temporal epileptiform discharges consistent with multiple active underlying epileptogenic foci.
The background activity was diffusely slow with slower frequencies over the right hemisphere suggestive of a diffuse  encephalopathy with more severe dysfunction of the right hemisphere.

Brief Hospital Course: 42 yo F with hx of refractory seizure disorder (on 3 AEDs and w/[**Month/Year (2) 15741**]; followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 16883**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 85740**]) following resective and radiation therapy for [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 111222**] in infancy, multiple meningiomas, MR/ID and pan-hypopituitarism with chronic hypothermia, obesity with OSA (no CPAP) who presents with hypothermia and increased seizure frequency.
Etiology of hypothermia - likely hypothalamic, prophylactic steroids unlikely to help.
No infectious etiology or relationship with seizures.
She is now maintaining her baseline temperature (usually around 96-98F) without intervention.
She was connected to LTM and had no evidence of seizure activity overnight.
Continuous video EEG recording captured 2 seizures with brief behavioral arrest, electrographically associated with electrodecrement then fast activity.
EEG otherwise showed multifocal epileptiform discharges.
The patient had several complex partial-type seizures, usuaully 1-2 per day on average.
She also had [**1-4**] generalized tonic clonic seizures.
This was about 1 minute of unresponsiveness with bilateral arm stiffening and jerking.
Afterwards, she was confused and drowsy for about 30-45 minutes.
She is unlikely to attain better seizure control with adjustments to her AED regimen, and there will be a balance between side effects/drowsiness and seizure control, so no changes in her seizure medications were made during this hospitalization.
Please swipe [**Month/Day (2) 15741**] magnet for any seizure activity.
*ENDOCRINE: Endocrine was consulted and her Hydrocortisone was increased to 25 [**Hospital1 **] for the first two days of hospitalization, however this was generally empiric to cover her for potential infection or increased seizures and not meant to specifically improve her temperature stability.
*INFECTIOUS DISEASE: While on the epilepsy service she had a couple other events of elevated temperature.
It was determined that her variable temps should be treated empirically with NSAIDs unless there were other clinical signs of infection.
A screening WBC, UA and CXR would be reasonable if there was any other clinical concern for infection (O2 demand while awake, change in HR or RR, etc),  *PULMONARY: O2 sats were monitored and she was given supplemental O2 as needed (hx of OSA not on CPAP).
- Please treat low or high temperatures with ibuprofen 600 mg q6 hours.
Please note that the patient can become more somnolent or have slightly increased seizure frequency with abnormal temperatures and this alone may not be indicative of an infection.
Plan for seizures: - wipe [**Hospital 15741**] magnet for any seizure - please keep record of all seizures and bring to any neurology/epilepsy appointments - seizure precautions - Ativan prn for any seizure longer than 5 minutes or more than 3 in one hour  Medications on Admission: Lamictal 400 mg daily 8am/350 mg at 8pm Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (8am, 8pm) zonisamide 350 mg daily at 8pm ativan 0.5 mg Q HS synthroid 112 mcg daily Cortef 15 mg qAM (8am), 10 mg qPM (4pm) progesterone 100 mg TID tums metamucil, senna, colace vitamin C, D, MVI tylenol prn  Discharge Medications: 1.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with hypothermia and lethargy.
She had a few more episodes of labile temperatures above 99.
These changes in temperature, in the absence of other clinical symptoms should be considered part of her hypothalmic dysfunction and can be treated empirically with ibuprofen.
- Please treat low or high temperatures with ibuprofen 600 mg q6 hours.
Please note that the patient can become more somnolent or have slightly increased seizure frequency with abnormal temperatures and this alone may not be indicative of an infection.
