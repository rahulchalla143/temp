History of Present Illness: 71 y/o woman who has not seen a physician for about 20 presented to the with several weeks of malaise, fatigue, and then today developed a headache with new-onset confusion and a high blood sugar.
She states that she has been urinating more frequently and drinking more H2O for the past few weeks and has had decreased appetite over the same period.
She states that before yesterday, she was able to walk up and down stairs without CP/SOB and denies ever experiencing exertional CP/SOB.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors, but does note some recent dysuria; no h/o UTIs in the past.
In the ED, initial VS were: T 98.4 HR 119 BP 200/116 O2 Sat 97% RA EKG was notable for diffuse deep TWI most prominent in the lateral leads.
Cardiology was consulted and felt given the diffuse nature of the EKG changes, they were most liklely toxic/metabolic in the setting of DKA and did not represent an acute plaque rupture.
She was noted to be altered, CT head showed no acute process.
UA showed small leuks/blood and glucose 1000, for which she received Ceftriaxone 1g IV x1.
On arrival to the MICU, initial VS were: T 98 BP 165/05 HR 120 RR 14 O2 Sat 100% Non Rebreather She denies CVP/SOB/N/V lightheadedness, palpitations or diaphoresis.
She stated her LLE was numb but otherwise had no specific complaints.

Diffuse T wave inversions throughout the limb leads and precordium.
Q-T interval prolongation.
Possible anterior wall myocardial infarction.
Deep symmterical diffuse T wave inversions raise the possibility of cardiomyopathy.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2135-2-13**] 7:40 PM IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute process.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2135-2-13**] 7:57 PM IMPRESSION: Right hemidiaphragm elevation with opacification posteriorly suggesting extensive adjacent lung atelectasis, though cannot exclude developing infectious process.
Possible right pleural effusion as well.
ABDOMEN (LAT DECUB ONLY) LEFT Study Date of [**2135-2-13**] 9:04 PM IMPRESSION: No evidence of free air.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %) with hypokinesis to akinesis of the mid to distal/apical LV.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
RV with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No angiographically-apparent obstructive coronary artery disease.
Markedly-elevated left-sided filling pressures.
Moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension, with a normal transpulmonary pressure gradient.
Obstruction of the left CFA, reconstitution of the deep femoral artery at the level of the mid thigh but no reconstitution of the superficial femoral artery.
Peroneal and posterior tibial artery opacification is seen to the mid calf.
Obstruction of the right superficial femoral artery with reconstitution observed above the knee.
Three-vessel runoff in the right leg is observed with anterior tibial artery opacification terminating mid calf.
Bilateral pleural effusion and right lower lobe collapse.
Large area of hypoattenuation seen within the right lobe of the liver, consistent with hepatic cyst.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid left ventricular hypokinesis and apical akinesis.
No left ventricular thrombus identified.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.

There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Parenchymal opacities in the left lung are similar to mildly worsened.

**FINAL REPORT [**2135-2-16**]**     MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2135-2-16**]):    No MRSA isolated.
For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.

Distal gastrectomy (A-L): - Peptic ulcers, 4 cm and 1.5 cm, involving submucosa; no malignancy identified.
The extensive right apical lateral consolidation has substantially cleared.
It is unclear whether this represents clearing pneumonia or possible decrease in asymmetric pulmonary edema.
Opacification at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm is consistent with pleural effusion.
Right hemidiaphragmatic contour is elevated, possibly relating to pleural effusion, with streaks of atelectasis at the base.
Non-specific T wave flattening and inversion in leads V3-V6.
The previously described T wave inversions on the tracing of [**2135-2-14**] across the precordial leads are now far less pronounced.
There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions with relatively substantial areas of atelectasis.
No evidence of new parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
There are persistent bilateral pleural effusions along with unchanged opacification of right lung base.
Opacification at the left lung base is unchanged, and pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 y/o woman with no recent medical care presenting to the emergency room  with mental status changes, elevated blood sugar and EKG changes with  positive cardiac biomarkers.
Admitting EKG did show convex ST elevations in V3 and diffuse TWI inversions in the setting of severe metabolic disturbance and hypertension likely representingh LV strain and not indicative of an acute coronary event.
Takosubo cardiomyopathy pattern was  noted on initial ultrasound raising  the possibilty for catecolamine surge and acute LV dysfunction.
She experienced respiratory distress during this time  and required intubation for 24 hours.
Because of these findings, the patient underwent cardiac catherization where she was found to have clean coronaries.
The patient had no chest pain throughout her hospital stay and cardiology felt she likely did have a takasubo's in the setting of her limb ischemia.
Her chest x-ray at this time did shown  an elevated right hemi-diaphram with an unclear cause.
No free air was seem under the diaphragm.
She was showing signs of respiratory distress  Upon admission, she was reported to have urine ketones, metabolic acidosis and significantly elevated blood and urine glucose  indicative of diabetic ketoacidosis.
She was also found to have urine specimen concerning for infection and received a dose of cedtriaxone.
The urine specimen did grow out citrobacter and she completed a week course ceftriaxone which was completed on [**2135-2-19**].
She was also reporting left lower extremity weakness which was concerning for critical limb ischemia in the setting of non-dopplerable RLE pulses, elevated lactate and new diabetic ketoacidosis.
Vascular surgery was consulted and she underwent a cat scan angio which showed complete occlusion of her left CFA.
She had persistent numbness of  the left foot with dorsi and plantar flexion weakness.
She was discharged to the floor and began experiencing coffee ground emesis with abdominal pain with a drop in her hematocrit from 29 to 24.
GI service was consulted and she underwent an emergent EGD which showed a duodenal ulcer and severe esophagitis.
Surgical pain was controlled with intravenous analgesia with conversion to oral agents.
She did have mild elevation of her INR and her daily dosing was decreased.
At a time she was diet controlled with only nightly Lantus but with improved/increased PO intake she was placed back on a gentle insulin sliding scale.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] for altered mental status.
You also had left lower leg numbness and you were found to have a blood clot in your leg which was blocking blood flow.
You also were found to have an electrolyte disturbance related to your diabetes.
You also had elevated cardiac enzymes and you were seen by our cardiologists.
While they were performing a cardiac catheterization you had some difficulty breathing and you were briefly intubated (a breathing tube was placed) for a day and the tube was then removed.
Our cardiologists felt you had Takasubo's cardiomyopathy, which is a heart conditions where part of your heart does not contract with the rest of the heart.
After your were transferred to the medical floor, you developed coffee-ground vomitting.
You underwent an EGD which showed a duodenal ulcer.
