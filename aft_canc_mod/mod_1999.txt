He was sent home from the Emergency Department and the presented again on [**2-22**] complaining of increasing shortness of breath over two weeks and a productive cough (blood tinged).
His first episode of chills, or chest pain.
On [**2-22**], a chest x-ray revealed a question of mediastinal lymphadenopathy and a left lower lobe infiltrate.
Computed tomography showed bilateral hilar and subcarinal adenopathy with a carinal mass.
A computed tomography showed bilateral hilar subcarinal adenopathy mass protruding into the right carina, and a right middle lobe consolidation.
Bronchoscopy on [**2-25**] showed a large right tracheal mass causing a 75% occlusion of the right main stem bronchus, and biopsies were obtained.
A sputum culture revealed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
His hospital course was also significant for persistent metabolic acidosis and transient atrial fibrillation with spontaneous conversion.
Endoscopy performed to place nasogastric tube after intubation revealed esophageal ulceration and trace guaiac-positive stools.
Iron deficiency anemia.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Lacri-Lube ophthalmic ointment.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with pancreatic cancer.
Father with colonic cancer.
No murmurs appreciated.
The abdomen was nondistended and soft.
Trace edema bilaterally.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A cardiac echocardiogram at the outside hospital revealed right atrium and right ventricle moderately enlarged, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, normal left ventricular systolic function, and a small posterior pericardial effusion.
Likely stage IV lung cancer given bilateral hilar subcarinal adenopathy.
However, given metabolic acidosis, the patient was thought to be unstable for bronchoscopy.
A cytology was obtained from the outside hospital which revealed only necrotic tissue with no tissue results.
He was continued on vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl for postobstructive left lower lobe pneumonia.
He continued with hypotension which responded to fluid boluses.
His metabolic gap and anion gap acidosis improved slightly with fluids.
for likely ischemic colitis.
A cosyntropin stimulation test was performed to rule out adrenal insufficiency.
