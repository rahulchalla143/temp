female with long standing Ulcerative colitis who presented with a few months of feeling poorly, 7 lb wt loss and jaundice (t.bili up to 27).
She was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP which showed a stricture and hilar mass.
Brushings  demonstrated atypical cells and no malignancy.
Subsequently, this stent was removed in order to place a R and L hepatic duct PTC.
Imaging delineated a mass like lesion at the bifurcation of the hepatic duct.
Denies EtOH   Family History: Sister with thyroid disease  Pertinent Results: [**2124-10-10**] 08:50AM   HGB-10.5* calcHCT-32 [**2124-10-10**] 08:50AM   GLUCOSE-105 LACTATE-1.0 NA+-139 K+-3.3* CL--101  Brief Hospital Course: On [**2124-10-10**] she underwent exploratory laparotomy, resection of extrahepatic biliary tree up to and beyond the bifurcation of the right and left hepatic ducts, portal lymphadenectomy and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy for cholangiocarcinoma.
Intraoperative findings included a large hilar cholangiocarcinoma involving primarily the bifurcation of the hepatic duct.
There was no evidence of carcinomatosis.
The liver was profoundly cholestatic and abnormal in appearance.
There was also a replaced accessory right hepatic artery coming off the SMA behind the common bile duct, and the normally situated right hepatic artery was encased in tumor and thrombosed.
Review of the frozensections with the pathologist, and all 3 lymph nodes had evidence, on further review, of mucinous-producing tumor consistent with a cholangiocarcinoma, and there was also microscopic tumor in both the right and left hepatic duct proximal resection margins.
The epidural was suspected as a cause for hypotension and this was capped.
She received IV fluid and colloid without improvement.
She was transferred to the SICU for possible sepsis and further management.
Cardiac enzymes were done to rule out a cardiogenic etiology for hypotension and Cardiology was consulted.
CXR were negative for pneumonia.
She was mildly confused and hallucinated.
The JP drained serosanuinous fluid and the two PTCs drained bile.
Tylenol was used for pain control.
Please see path report as follows:  Pathology Report DIAGNOSIS: I.  Celiac lymph node (A): No carcinoma.
Posterior common bile duct lymph node (D-E): Tiny focus of metastatic adenocarcinoma, in permanent slide D. No tumor in the original frozen sections.
V.  Bile duct (G-H): Invasive adenocarcinoma with perineural involvement.
Right duct margin (K): Invasive adenocarcinoma, with perineural involvement.
Gallbladder (L-N): Invasive adenocarcinoma at end of cholecystic duct and adjacent soft tissue IX.
Small bowel (O-R): Segment of small intestine, within normal limits.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Month/Day (2) **] of [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Biliary strictures biliary mass   Discharge Condition: good   Discharge Instructions: Please call Dr.[**Name (NI) 670**] office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] if you experience fever, chills, nauea, vomiting, jaundice, increased abdominal pain/distension or increasing redness, bleeding, or drainage from your incision.
