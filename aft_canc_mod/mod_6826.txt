Admission Date:  [**2122-3-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-3-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2047-3-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ambien  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9853**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea, hemodynamic monitoring  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line placement and removal   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 80827**] is a 74 year-old woman with a history of CHF, COPD on home O2, transferred from [**Hospital6 **] for further management of a newly diagnosed, 20 cm hepatic lesion, and also found to be dyspneic.
She has been doing poorly at home for the past several months, with worsening Pickwickian syndrome.
This pattern was gradually worsening until two days prior to arrival when she developed a nonproductive cough and more labored breathing.
Her son brought her to the [**Name (NI) **], however, because she had an episode of possible uterine bleeding where they noted dried blood on a chair after she stood up.
She has a history of significant uterine bleeding and her son was concerned that she was having a recurrence so he brought her to the ED.
At the OSH, she was noted to have left sided chest pain and LUQ pain.
A non-contrast CT torso was attained and demonstrated a 20cm low attenuation mass with possible areas of bleeding, a small amount of perihepatic fluid, and ?new bibasilar atelectasis.
However, her management also addressed her dyspnea, and the initial impression was that she was also experiencing a COPD exacerbation secondary to pneumonia.
She was therefore given levofloxacin, solumedrol, and 1 unit of blood, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for hepatology management, hemodynamic monitoring, and possible IR procedure for hemostasis.
She was found to be mildly dyspneic and was given nebs.
The liver transplant service was also contact[**Name (NI) **] and concluded that they did not feel that this was an acute bleed, and that there was no role for acute operative or IR intervention.
Review of systems is otherwise negative for N/V/D/F/C.
Past Medical History: Atrial fibrillation ([**2121**]; briefly anticoagulated in [**2121**] but not currently) CHF COPD DM2 ([**2113**]) CVA ([**2-/2121**]) w/ left sided weakness (resolved) S/p cholecystectomy ([**2086**]) Uterine fibroid   Social History: She has a 75-100 pack year smoking history (~2 packs per day for 50 years) but quit smoking 15 years ago.
[**Name (NI) **] son notes increasing problems with [**Name2 (NI) 80828**] and alertness and states that she has been falling asleep at the dinner table.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: General Appearance: Overweight / Obese  Eyes / Conjunctiva: PERRL  Head, Ears, Nose, Throat: Normocephalic  Lymphatic: Cervical WNL, Supraclavicular WNL  Cardiovascular: (S1: Normal), (S2: Normal)  Peripheral Vascular: (Right radial pulse: Present), (Left radial pulse: Present), (Right DP pulse: Present), (Left DP pulse: Not assessed)  Respiratory / Chest: (Expansion: Symmetric), (Percussion: Resonant : ), (Breath Sounds: Diminished: )  Abdominal: Soft, Non-tender, Bowel sounds present, Obese  Extremities: Right: 1+, Left: 1+  Skin:  Warm  Neurologic: Follows simple commands, Responds to: Verbal stimuli, Movement: Not assessed, Tone: Not assessed, Very sedated and moving slowly, appears encephalopathic   Pertinent Results: cxr [**3-12**]: Bibasilar atelectasis, however, no evidence of CHF exacerbation.
ct abd: Suggestion of lipomatous deposition in the interatrial septum of the heart.
Clincial correlation advised as this can be associated with arrhythmias.
Vascular atherosclerotic calcifications.
Large, 20-cm predominantly low-density mass occupying the majority of the right lobe of the liver, with internal regions of hyperattenuation consistent with blood.
Calcified rim suggests a slow growing lesion.
Additional hypoattenuating lesions within the caudate and the left lobe of the liver are incompletely characterized.
Small amount of perisplenic and perihepatic free fluid.
Degenerative changes of the spine with grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4 on L5.
[**3-12**] echo: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Global left ventricular function is probably normal, but a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Mild right ventricular dilation with normal systolic function.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Small pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
LENI: Slightly limited exam without evidence of DVT.
CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase of bilateral basal parenchymal opacities suggestive to represent atelectasis.
No clear evidence of overhydration.
No focal parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 80827**] is a 74 year-old woman with a history of CHF, COPD on home O2, transferred from [**Hospital6 **] for further management of a newly diagnosed, 20 cm hepatic lesion, and also found to be dyspneic.
Acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure: Initially, multiple etiologies were considered including CHF exacerbation vs pneumonia/COPD exacerbation vs PE.
Despite the fact she had no wheezing suggesting worsening COPD and was afebrile, as she appeared quite ill she was initially treated for pneumonia/CHF exacerbation with furosemide for diuresis as well as levofloxacin.
There was considerable concern for PE as well but due to concern about her liver mass as well as possible vaginal bleeding anticoagulation was held.
On hospital day two, however, her respiratory status began to improve significantly with diuresis and further control of her atrial fibrillation (see below).
As she had had no fevers and there was no clear infiltrate on chest radiograph with no wheezing antibiotics were stopped and she was just kept on inhalers.
Initially there were some attempts to increase her to greater than 95 % and she received increasing O2 but this seemed to contribute to a depressed respiratory drive (attributed to her COPD and appearance of chronic CO2 retention) so this was stopped.
#Chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has COPD and Pickwickian syndrome and a chronically elevated bicarbonate suggesting an ongoing respiratory acidosis.
As she had no significant wheezing steroids were held though she did continue to receive her home meds.
After falling asleep in a chair on her second night in the hospital she was extremely difficult to arouse the following morning with ABG showing a worsening of her chronic respiratory acidosis.
This was thought due to hypoventilation due to habitus and perhaps increased O2 provided during the night due to fear of ACS (as the patient complained of some chest pain), which could cause decreased respiratory drive in a chronic CO2 retainer such as this.
?Congestive heart failure: The patient was dyspneic on presentation and has evidence of chronic diastolic CHF on TTE.
#Chest Pain: The patient had chest pain on her first and second hospital nights.
These incidents of pain were atypical, there were no EKG changes, and cardiac enzymes remained flat.
The first night this improved with diuresis and rate control.
On the second this resolved with positioning and was thought largely due to the patient's habitus and difficult positioning herself in bed.
Chronic kidney disease: The patient reported a history of CKD of unclear etiology.
History of uterine bleeding: The patient had a history of uterine bleeding and had a questionable incident of bleeding prior to presentation.
They deferred pelvic exam as there was no further bleeding noted and her Hct remained stable.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Southeastern MA Health & Rehabilitation Center  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: hepatic hemangioma, COPD, atrial fibrillation with RVR Secondary: chronic diastolic CHF, DM2, h/o CVA   Discharge Condition: good, stable, mental status at baseline, not somnolent, breathing comfortably at rest with 0-2L O2   Discharge Instructions: You were evaluated for consideration of treatment of a hepatic hemangioma as well as for respiratory distress.
The surgeons do not feel any intervention for the hemangioma is warranted at this time.
If you have worsening shortness of breath, fevers, chills, chest pain, confusion, or any other concerning symptoms, have the doctors at rehab [**Name5 (PTitle) 4656**] you.
