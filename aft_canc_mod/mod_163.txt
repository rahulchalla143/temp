Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 7509**] is an 81 year old male with history of lung cancer s/p resection, prostate ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with respiratory failure and atrial fibrillation with RVR.
# Respiratory failure: Patient required intubation in the ED on [**4-21**] for hypoxia and respiratory distress.
Etiology felt likely combination of IVF resuscitation in the setting of CHF, afib with RVR, likely PE and profound metabolic acidosis that the patient was attempting to compensate for (initial pH on arrival to the ICU 7.16).
#Hypotension: Likely secondary to sepsis and A-fib with RVR.
# Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient presented in atrial fibrillation with RVR, most likely a result of sepsis.
He has a history of afib with RVR in the setting of acute illness in the past.
His home metoprolol was held in the setting of hypotension while requiring levophed for blood pressure support.
His heart rate was atrial fibrillation with rate 80s-100 on the day of discharge.
# Fever: Patient had been on cipro/flagyl for medical management of a ruptured appendicitis with course to end on [**4-22**].
Initial fever on presentation may have represented worsening of this process vs. aspiration pneumonitis from intubation vs. other occult infectious process.
Notably, the patient did not have an elevated WBC count.
He may not have been able to mount a robust inflammatory response due to older age and a generally chronically ill state.
CT abdomen-pelvis was negative for any drainable abscesses and showed improvement of his ruptured appendix.
He did have yeast in both urine and sputum cultures.
He was started on fluconazole for his positive beta-glucan on [**4-27**].
He remained afebrile for >72 hours.
# Abdominal pain: The patient intermittently had abdominal discomfort on exam.
Although this was difficult to assess while he was intubated, it was concerning given his history of a medically managed ruptured appendicitis.
He was C.diff neg x 2, and had no residuals with tube feeds that were initiated per surgery recommendations.
KUB was negative for ileus or obstruction.
The patient denied any abdominal pain after he was extubated.
Surgery did not feel his h/o appendicitis was still and issue.
# Hypernatremia: Likely secondary to free water deficit as patient intermittently required D5W.
He was slightly more anasarcic, but encouraged PO water and given one more d5W bolus.
# Acute on chronic renal failure:  Slowly resolved over the course of the patient's hospitalization.
B12,  folate, & iron  within normal limits (though ferritin may be elevated as an acute phase reactant and should be rechecked once pt recovers from acute illness).
Also having low grade hematuria (pink urine) off and on (with anticoagulation/INR 2.2).
He had no signs of bleeding and he was stool guiaic negative.
# Right subclavian vein thrombosis/Presumed PE: Significant erythema and edema of RUE on admission.
PAtient's TTE showed signs of likely pumonary embolism, but given the patient's creatinine CTA was not possible.
Warfarin was increased to 2.5 daily but the patient then became supratherapeutic (3.6 to 4.8 to 4.0 on the day of discharge).
# Pancreatic mass: Followed as an outpatient and appears to have been stable on repeat imaging.
#Hematuria: Felt to be secondary to foley trauma, resolved by discharge.
Ipratropium Bromide 17 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Two (2) Puff Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezes.
