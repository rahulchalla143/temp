Admission Date:  [**2126-12-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-1-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2066-10-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: This is a 60-year-old man with cirrhosis due to hepatitis C (VL in [**10-4**] was > 1 million) and alcohol, ESLD on transplant list, h/o GI bleed, esophageal varices, recent HCC s/p radiofrequency ablation, presented to OSH ED with weakness and poor PO intake.
He was found to have anemia to hct of 22, requiring 3 units of pRBCs.
He also c/o dyspnea, but no cough, and was found to have a LLL infiltrate.
Overnight on [**12-20**] to [**12-21**], pt appeared fluid overloaded with dyspnea, so furosemide was started.
He was also started on methylprednisone for possible wheezing and concern for developing shock and ?adrenal insufficiency (BP 84/51).
Per patient report, he initially presented to the hospital because of weakness in all his muscles and hips, which had been gradually worsening since [**2126-7-25**].
And in fact, had not had a cough at home.
He has had progressive SOB for several months since [**Month (only) 205**], but denies CP or pleuritic CP.
He says he's afraid to take deep breaths since his RFA, and had CP then that felt like "a rib was broken," but currently denies any CP or pleuritic CP.
He denies any fever, chills or night sweats, but says at the hospital yesterday he was told he had a low-grade fever.
He denies leg swelling, abdominal swelling or abdominal pain.
He has had watery BM's with the lactulose, and had a black stool yesterday, but denies BRBPR.
Currently, the patient states he feels anxious about everything that's going on, and feels slightly short of breath, but otherwise denies complains.
He currently denies any pain anywhere.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Past Medical History: Hepatitis C End-stage liver disease (on transplant list) as of [**11/2126**] Hepatocellular carcinoma s/p radiofrequency ablation [**2126-11-6**] GI bleed in [**2126-7-25**]: EGD with "watermelon stomach," grade [**1-26**] esophageal varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy Gastroesophageal reflux disease COPD/emphysema due to a long history of smoking (never been intubated or required steroids) Depression Anxiety Seasonal allergies Left cataract surgery h/o alcohol use, last used 35yrs ago  Social History: Notable for significant tobacco use, which he reports he quit approximately 15 years ago, previous smoking history 2 ppdx20yrs, 40py.
He used injection drugs (barbituates) last in the [**2086**]'s and had multiple tattoos with shared needles.
Family History: Notable for lung cancer in both of his parents, both deceased.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL: Vitals: T: 98.8 BP: 121/65 P: 84 R: 21 O2: 92% on 100% non-rebreather General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, dry MM, poor oral hygiene with drying secretions on lips and teeth Neck: supple, JVP not elevated though difficult to evaluate given thick neck, no LAD Lungs: no use of accessory mm of breathing, speaking in full sentences, fine crackles in LLL, no rhonchi or wheezes CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: +BS, soft, non-tender, non-distended, no rebound tenderness or guarding, liver edge not palpated, no fluid wave GU: foley placed, yellow urine in foley catheter Skin: erythema in lower abdomenal skin folds, several petechiae on bilateral lower extremities Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema .
IMAGING: CXR [**12-21**]: New extensive parenchymal opacities have been demonstrated throughout the lungs with significant worsening of the left lower lobe consolidation and new right upper lung consolidation as well as diffuse opacities.
There is no appreciable pneumothorax.
Some degree of underlying pulmonary edema definitely cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 60 year old male with hep C cirhosis, HCC s/p radiofreqency ablation, recently added to the transplant list, who presented with pneumonia at OSH, transferred here for further management.
Hypoxia, dyspnea:  The pt had c/o dyspnea, but no cough.
His dyspnea was thought to be due to to PNA as evidenced by new purulent cough and infiltrates on exam, also suggested by CXR with worsening consolidation in LLL and new consolidation in RUL.
No evidence of pulmonary HTN on echo, not fluid overloaded with normal EF, and no evidence of PE on CTA.
OSH CT chest was reviewed, showing diffuse GGOs.
OSH microdata showed no growth.
Patient's sputum showing AFB on smear was sent to state lab for PCR probe, which was indeterminate for MTB.
Initial and repeat BAL failed to grow bacterial organisms, and were negative for PJP via immunofluorescence, as well as legionella, fungal, and viral cultures.
A quantiferon gold was sent given concern for MTB and was negative.
The patient was maintained on the vent during his ICU course, and early on met criteria for ARDS and so was placed on ARDSnet vent settings.
He tolerated these setting well, but showed little signs of improvement, thus precluding attempts to wean the ventilator.
Wide coverage for typical and atypical bacterial sources was maintained in the ICU, though MTB treatment was not initiated d/t equivocal testing and patient's baseline liver disease.
He also received a trial of steroids, but continued to pull extremely high tidal volumes (though some minimal improvement on the vent).
# pancytopenia: Patient initially presented to OSH with Hct of 22, with guaiac positive stools, but not frank bleeding.
His omeprazole was increased from 40mg daily to [**Hospital1 **] given recent Hct drop, guaiac positive stools.
Thrombocytopenia was thought to be related to his liver disease initially.
BM team was consulted, with concern of possible infiltrative process.
A peripheral smear indicated probable adequate marrow function and a B.M.
Bx was taken which showed no growth and No clonal cytogenetic aberrations were identified.
On [**1-2**] all antibiotics of Vanc, meropenem and Levaquin were d/c'd given likely non-infectious etiology, negative cultures and Infectious Disease recommendations.
#Cellulitis vs. DVT: Patients R arm overlying PICC became swollen, ecchymotic and erythematous and he spiked fevers around the same time.
An UE U/S showed no DVT, and given cellulitic appearance and pain, the picc was pulled.
There was not immediate resolution of symptoms, and some spreading of the ecchymosis and pain led to concern for bleeding into the arm.
There was no progression of the swelling and compartment syndrome was ruled out.
