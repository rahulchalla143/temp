He had one episode of hematemesis on [**12-5**]/ and two episodes on [**12-6**] as well as hematemesis and hematochezia on [**12-7**].
patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 18 and was transfused two units of packed red blood cells and was noted to be having coagulopathy with INR of 2.1 and was given FFP as well as vitamin K.  Patient denies any past history of varices or upper GI bleed.
He was feeling nauseated and began vomiting and continued to have hematemesis for three days until he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for definitive care.
He underwent EGD on [**2110-12-8**] and was banded with sclerotherapy for grade 3 lower esophageal varices in both the lower and mid-esophagus.
Patient also had an abdominal CT on [**2110-12-4**] for followup of chemoembo which showed portal vein thrombosis.
No fever, or chills.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hepatitis C virus and alcoholic cirrhosis diagnosed in [**2101**].
Duodenal ulcer status post perforation with repair in [**2101**].
He was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma in [**5-6**].
He had radiotherapy as well as chemoembolization therapy.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Generally, he was slightly drowsy and jaundiced in mild distress.
Cardiac exam was regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left base.
Lungs were clear to auscultation with minimal rales at the left base.
Abdomen was distended with mild tenderness in the right lower quadrant, no guarding, no rebound as well as a well healed midline scar.
Extremities revealed trace pedal edema bilaterally, no clubbing or cyanosis.
Skin exam revealed diffuse spider angioma.
No caput medusae.
He had no focal deficits.
He had minimal asterixis in the left hand upon presentation, however, it resolved upon admission to [**Hospital1 1444**].
It was noted that he had grade 3 esophageal varices in the lower third of the esophagus.
Patient had no new episodes of hematemesis nor hematochezia during his hospitalization.
Patient became guaiac negative after two days of passing darkened clots in his stool.
Patient underwent unguided paracentesis with withdrawal of approximately 40 cc of transudative fluid with no cells and cultures were negative.
It was significant, however, for thickened bowel wall secondary to edematous changes from fluid overload.
Patient was to be diuresed with Aldactone and Lasix to remove the excess fluid in the abdominal wall as well as the intestinal wall.
Low grade fever.
Patient had blood cultures drawn times six which were all negative for bacteremia.
Patient also had chest x-ray which was negative for infiltrate.
There was no source found for patient's low grade fever.
It is possible that patient has low grade fever secondary to his hepatocellular carcinoma status post chemoembolization.
Patient remained nontoxic appearing throughout his hospitalization and no focus or nidus of infection was found to explain patient's intermittent low grade fever.
Mild hypocalcemia and hyponatremia.
It was felt to be hypervolemic hyponatremia secondary to the low urine sodium and obvious increase in total body water.
It was also noted that patient was mildly hypocalcemic with corrected calcium of 7.8.
Hypocalcemia was most likely secondary to diuresis as well as hepatic failure secondary to hep C cirrhosis as well as hepatocellular carcinoma.
Hepatocellular carcinoma status post chemoembolization.
Patient was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in-house for question of possible further chemoembolization.
Upper GI bleed secondary to varices status post sclerotherapy as well as band ligation.
