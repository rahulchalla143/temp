He felt "stunned" but had no LOC.
Then had a vertex headache since which latterly was also bifrontal but was mild and intermittent.
Since Wednesday, his symptoms worsened with more severe headache, nausea and vomiting.
He also had some light-headedness when sitting or standing and felt "funny".
Patient went to see PCP and had [**Name Initial (PRE) **] CT today at OSH whch showed bilateral subdural hematomas and was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation.
ON INITIAL TRANSFER TO INTERNAL MEDICINE SERVICE 70 year old man with known HTN/hyperlipidemia, essential thrombocytosis on Anagrelide (phospholipase A2 inhibitor - platelet reducing [**Doctor Last Name 360**]), who presented on [**2112-11-11**] with headache and nausea and vomiting, ad was found to have bilateral Sub-dural hematomas, left greater than right, with some rightward shift of midline structures by approximately 5mm, for which he underwent R burr hole evacuation and L mini craniotomy and evacuation, membrane lysis, adhesiolysis.
He has also been started on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
However, subsequently developed increasing agitation and delirium and required Haldol and transient restraints.
At this point in his course, he was noted to have desaturations and vital signs revealing that he was 100% around MN Tuesday am then nadirs to 84-91% on RA in the early am Tuesday.
In response to this, this am he was given 10 IV Lasix, an Ipratropium neb, and has been getting IV Metoprolol.
Pt was interviewed prior to the CTA and denied SOB, CP, pain anywhere, and was without any complaints.
However, his daughter and wife at the bedside stated that his mental baseline at hat point was far from his baseline.
The patient subsequently required a short stay in the medical ICU for treatment of hypoxia, tachycardia and delrium.
MEDICINE INTERVAL COURSE FROM MICU This is a 70 year old man with essential thrombocytosis, now s/p bilateral craniotomy/burr holes for SDH on [**11-13**] who developed hypoxia, tachycardia, HTN on the floor and found to have severe bilateral pulmonary infiltrates concerning for aspiration vs pulmonary hemorrhage.
On exam, overall he looks 180 degrees better, his dyspnea is better, juguluar pulsations noted at angle of mandiblelungs are surprisingly very clear, RRR with slower rate and crescendo-descrescendo AS type murmur heard, abdomen soft NT ND benign, no BLE edema, and extremities are warm and well perfused.
Labs showed a declining Hct but improved WBC count and plts from prior.
He had developed a mild elevation in Troponin while CK and MB are negative; most recent EKG shows improved rate.
CXR has no read yet, to me it appears very minimally improved but still with a very impressive L > R infiltrates.
Due to persistent tachycardia while on the medica service, with the evenua development of relative hypotension,the patient was transferred to the cardiology service for ongoig management of her heart rate and blood pressure.
MEDICINE INTERVAL EVENTS ON TRANSFER FROM CARDIOLOGY The patient was transferred back from the Cardiology service after stabilization of persistent SVT's, despite multiple nodal agents and 200 TID Amiodarone.
Telemetry shows normal sinus rhythm with alarms for occasional frequent ectopy and bigeminy/trigeminy as before but overall much less ectopy and runs of SVT's.
He is also on subQ Heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
His WBC count is still elevated, but he has had no fevers, and cultures were negative.
He is stable on room air, and his CXR is improved but still with infiltrates that I still suspect are aspiration event and not edema or PNA.

RADIOLOGY: [**11-11**] CXR- IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
[**11-12**] CT Head- IMPRESSION: Allowing for differences in technique, there is a mild interval increase in the left hemispheric subdural hematoma.
Stable small right hemispheric subdural hematoma.
Expected postoperative pneumocephalus in the bifrontal regions secondary to interval evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas.
Persistent hypodense subdural hematomas slightly smaller bilaterally with no significant midline shift.
[**11-14**] CT Head- IMPRESSION: Status post burr hole and craniotomy for bilateral subdural hemorrhage evacuation, with decreased degree of pneumocephalus and extent of the hemorrhages.
Left parafalcine tiny dense subdural hemorrhage is decreasing from the prior study.
There are no filling defects in the main and lobar pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolism.
Bilateral ground-glass opacities in the perihilar, bilateral upper lobes, and superior segment of the right lower lobe are likely due to hemorrhage; aspiration has similar radiologic appearance.
This pattern does not favor interstitial lung disease.
Mild-to-moderate right more than left simple pleural effusion with atelectasis of adjacent lung.
Multiple borderline-sized mediastinal lymph nodes.
[**11-15**] CXR IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-11**]: Widespread new interstitial pulmonary abnormality, increase in heart size and mediastinal vascular engorgement are findings of pulmonary edema due to cardiac decompensation.
There is particularly pronounced abnormality in the right upper and paraspinal lower lungs; it could be asymmetric pulmonary edema or another process such as large scale pneumonia, aspiration or hemorrhage.
Pleural effusion is small if any.
No pneumothorax.
[**2112-11-16**]: echo The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with hyperdynamic systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Calcified aortic leaflets without frank stenosis.
Moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
[**2112-11-17**]: CXR FINDINGS: There is a relative stable appearance to bilateral perihilar opacities.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is present.
Stable appearance of the chest with findings most suggestive of pulmonary edema.
Marked improvement in pulmonary edema which is nearly resolved, with only minimal residual interstitial edema remaining.
Patchy alveolar opacity at right lung base has also improved, and likely reflects resolving dependent edema.
No new or worsening lung or pleural abnormalities.
10/19/201 CXR IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**11-15**] through 15: Pulmonary edema on [**11-17**] has largely resolved.
These are concerning for pneumonia given the improvement elsewhere.
There is the suggestion of a new nodule in the left mid lung at the level of the sixth posterior interspace, not present on either prior chest radiographs or CTA on [**11-15**], and, if real, would have to be a septic embolus.
When feasible I would obtain conventional chest radiographs to see if a nodule is present and [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] evaluate the residual abnormality in the right lung.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 year old man with known essential thrombocytosis on Anagrelide,and hypetension,  who presented with bilateral subdural hematomas from trauma, ad was treated with  bilateral craniotomies and burr holes.
His course was notable for transient hypoxia, tachycardia which rauired multiple agents to be initiated, and at one point, he met SIRS criteria for potential sepsis and found to have diffuse pulmonary infiltrates likely due to aspiration +/- flash edema.
Hiscourse was particularly notable for hypertension and supraventricular tachycardia whih were difficult to control, and persistently elevated WBC and platelet count in the setting of know hematologic disease.
CT scan on [**11-12**] revealed slight increase in SDH.
Surgery was without complication and the patient was extubated and transferred to the ICU.
No further complications during his course occurred from NeuroSurgical perspective.
SIRS criteria and hypoxia: While on the neurosurgial service, the pt developed increased agitation and required restraints and haldol administration.
He became more tachycardic and developed SIRS criteria with more elevated WBC count (had baseline leukocytosis on admission), tachycardia, hyperventilation, and fevers.
CTA was performed but did not show evidence of PE; it did show bilateral ground glass opacities concerning for aspiration vs pulmonary hemorrhage, given his essential thrombocytosis and increased predilection for bleeding.
He was transferred to Internal Medicine, and spent one night in the MICU for worsening hypoxia in the setting of severe HTN and tachycardia.
Pulmonary hemorrhage did not clinically fit and felt less likely; he was thought to have aspirated with some element of flash hypertensive edema.
By discharge, the patient had been afebrile and satting well on room air for  over 1 week.
Persistently elevated WBC count was thought to be due to hematologic process as he was ~14 on admission, rose to high teens, but back down to ~14 on d/c.
We did not feel that he had significnt pulmonary edema, but itis ossible thata transient aspiration could have presented in this manner.
We noted that a CXR prior to discharge to evaluate interval changes was formally read as possible infiltrate vs septic emboli.
We did not feel these diagnoses fit with his clinical picture, andrelayd this information to the PCP and family to ensure follow-up imaging were performed.
Hypertension and tachycardia: After MICU call out, pt remained very hypertensive and tachycardic, with very frequent runs of supraventricular tachycardia, called as 2:1 Aflutter vs AFib vs MAT vs sinus with frequent ectopy, coupled to runs of bigeminy/trigeminy/SVT's.
It was felt to be due to catecholaminergic storm of acute illness, possibly also related to the head bleed.
We suspected tha very close monitoing of his cardiac status would be needed, given his complex cardiac regimen, and therefore spoke with his referring providers and provided extensive discussion with the patient and family regarding warning signs and follow-up suggestions.
The pt and his family were repeatedly instructed on him being on 3 blood pressure and rate medications and that as his underlying intracranial process resolves, to be careful for bradycardia, hypotension, and what to look out for.
Hematology: Pt with known Essential Thrombocytosis (on ASA, Anagrelide) and pt's Hematologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 45462**] had been contact[**Name (NI) **].
Pt with platelet count 600's through initial part of admission and ASA/Anagrelide held; however during latter part of admission his plt count continued to rise.
Of note, pt restarted on iron per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 45462**], has had Iron-deficency Anemia before.
As above regarding no evidence of focal infection, and these values were stabe throughout his admission.
We attirbuted thiseither to his underlying hematologic process or his acute intracrnial process, but did not find an indication for empiric antibiotics.

Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 90989**], You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] and found to have bilateral subdural hematomas for which you went to the operating room and had procedures to remove the blood in your head.
Afterwards, you had low oxygen levels; tests showed that you did not have a pulmonary embolus, but there were abnormalities in your lungs that could have been due to aspiration (stomach contents inhaled into your lungs), or blood loss into your lungs, but the latter was felt to be less likely.
You had some blood loss from a level of 33 to 26 likely due to the surgery, but this was stable and improved to 28 by discharge.
START Docusate, Senna, and Polyethylene Glycol (Miralax) as needed to prevent constipation from Iron pills 11.
INCREASE Aspirin to 325 mg daily  As we extensively discussed, [**Male First Name (un) **] is on three blood pressure and heart rate lowering agents because we had such a difficult time controlling both.
We discussed things to look out for: dizziness or lightheadedness at rest or on standing, feeling not well, pulses less than 40 with symtpoms, chest pain, palpitations, paleness, etc.
