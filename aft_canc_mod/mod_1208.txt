Admission Date:  [**2106-2-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2106-3-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2034-10-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**] Chief Complaint: weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Resection of C5-C6 intradural mass along with laminectomy   History of Present Illness: 71M with a history of melanoma, s/p wide local excision and sentinel LN Bx in [**2100**] for 0.8 mm thick, [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level IV melanoma located in the R-posterior auricular area admitted with new metastitic melanoma.
In [**2100**], sentinel LN Bx showed melanoma so pt underwent a complete node dissection with no residual melanoma documented in the remaining nodes.
Pt underwent a wide local excision and sentinel LN Bx with the sentinel LN w/o evidence of melanoma.
At that time, he noted increased neck pain and pain in his upper and lower extremities.
The pt saw his PCP at that time who treated him with NSAIDs and muscle relaxants.
However, four weeks ago, the pt noted two small moles on the right side of his scalp.
He saw his dermatologist who did punch biopsies consistent with melanoma.
However, on Monday, his LE once again felt very weak and he had trouble walking and a repeat fall.
At the OSH, he received a MRI of the cervical spine on [**2-24**] that showed an enhancing, likely malignant extradural lesion at the level of mid C5 to mid C6 displacing the sac and cord posteriorly.
This was felt to be consistent with metastitic disease.
Screening sagittal views of the spine demonstrated no other abnormalities.
Pt also underwent a MRI of the brain that showed diffuse age related changes but no evidence of malignancy.
He is now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further oncologic and neurosurgical care.
In further ROS, pt denies fevers and chills.
No CP or palpitations.
Pt has a mild cough lately that is rarely productive of a small amount of sputum.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: The patient with melanoma and postoperative confusion.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute infarct seen on diffusion-weighted images.
Additionally, air is seen in both lateral ventricles and also in the frontal region, which could be secondary to recent surgery.
There is no evidence of midline shift seen.
Moderate ventricular prominence is visualized.
There is no periventricular edema seen.
No acute infarct is seen.
FINDINGS: As described in the recent MRI, there is a small amount of layering hemorrhage within the lateral ventricles.
In addition, punctate foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage are visualized within both temporoparietal regions.
There is no hydrocephalus, mass effect, or shift of the normally midline structures.
IMPRESSION:  Small amount of intraventricular and subarachnoid hemorrhage as above.
No definite filling defects are identified.
There has been interval development of small bilateral pleural effusions.
No pericardial effusion is identified.
Again identified are multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest located within the pretracheal region measuring 15 mm.
There has also been interval development of a large prevascular lymph node, which measures 10mm.
No pathologically enlarged axillary or hilar lymph nodes are seen.
There has been interval development of bibasilar collapse/consolidation.
Additionally seen are multiple small bilateral pulmonary nodules, which are not significantly changed since the prior examination, consistent with metastatic disease.
In the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, again demonstrated is a hypodense lesion within the right lobe of the liver, not significantly changed since the prior examination.
The visualized spleen and stomach appear unremarkable.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are present.
IMPRESSION:  1) No definite CT evidence for pulmonary embolism.
2) Interval development of bibasilar consolidation/collapse with small bilateral pleural effusions.
Relatively stable appearnace of multiple small pulmonary nodules consistent with metastatic disease.
4) Stable appearance of hypodensity within the right lobe of the liver suspicious for a metastasis  [**3-10**] MRI C-spine: PROCEDURE: An MRI of the cervical spine with and without contrast.
INDICATION: Spinal canal lesion status post excision.
MRI OF THE CERVICAL SPINE WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: There has been interval resection of the previously described intradural extramedullary lesion at the C5-C6 level.
On the current study, central increased signal intensity is identified within the spinal cord at the site of prior resection at the C5-C6 level.
This was appreciated on the prior exam, but due to severe compression on that examination, it is difficult to appreciate whether this amount of edema has increased.
Post-surgical changes are noted in the area of prior laminectomy.
No cord compression is appreciated on the current exam.
There is a small amount of linear enhancement seen along the anterior margin of the spinal cord at the resection site, which may indicate post- surgical change but residual tumor cannot be excluded at this site.
Vertebral body alignment and signal intensity is normal.
No prevertebral soft tissue abnormality is seen.
Spinal cord edema at the level of resection, seen on previous exam but unclear whether increased as the spinal cord had been severely compressed.
Small amount of linear enhancement along the anterior portion of the cord at the resection site.
This could indicate post-surgical change but the possibility of residual tumor cannot be excluded.
FINDINGS: There is a stable amount of high attenuation layering fluid in the lateral ventricles consistent with hemorrhage.
The previously noted punctate foci of increased attenuation within both temporoparietal lobes has decreased, consistent with resolving subarachnoid hemorrhage.
There are no new areas to indicate intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage.
There is no shift of midline structures.
IMPRESSION: Stable small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage with decreased subarachnoid hemorrhage and resolution of pneumocephalus.
[**3-16**] head CT: INDICATION: Patient with recent removal of intradural extramedullary lesion in cervical spine, post-operative subarachnoid hemorrhage.
FINDINGS: Again, noted is small amount of layering high-density fluid within the lateral ventricles, which is slightly decreased.
No regions of intracranial hemorrhage are seen.
There is no shift of normally midline structures, and the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/ white matter differentiation is unchanged.
[**3-17**] head CT: INDICATION: 71-year-old man with known metastatic melanoma status post spinal surgery, now with acute mental status changes, nonverbal.
No significant changes are seen compared to prior examination.
No change in the amount of intraventricular hemorrhage is noted.
[**3-25**] MRI T and L spine: INDICATION: A 71-year-old man with metastatic melanoma, recent resection of cervical spine intradural mass, now with possible incontinence.
THORACIC SPINE MRI: There is kyphosis of the midthoracic spine, however, vertebral body signal is within normal limits.
No abnormal signal is detected within the spinal cord.
There is no expansion of the cord or spinal stenosis.
There is mild right pleural thickening.
The cauda equina roots are aggregated and anteriorly displaced; additionally, there is a region of abnormal signal within the spinal canal at the S2-S3 level.
Thoracic spine MRI: No cord compression seen.
Lumbar spine MRI: Abnormal signal within the most distal portion of the spinal canal, with aggregation and displacement of the cauda equina roots.
This is concerning for arachnoiditis; the focus of abnormal signal in the distal spinal cord can represent a drop metastasis.
[**3-17**]: LP positive for malignant cells-melanoma   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 26122**] is a 71 year-old man with past medical history significant for melanoma (3 separate lesions) s/p wide local excision who presented on this admission with recurrent melanoma and a probable met from mid C5 to C6 displacing sac and cord posteriorly.
After resection, patient developed respiratory distress secondary to pneumonia requiring intubation and was transferred to the MICU.
Transferred to MICU on [**3-8**] for respiratory distress secondary to pneumonia, intubated.
Spinal lesion at C5-6 w/cord displacement: Felt to be most consistent with metastasis of the pt's recurrent melanoma.
The decision was made not to take patient to emergent neurosurgery given his dismal prognosis and extensive metastatic disease.
Patient reported few week history of severe right-sided weakness associated with mild left-sided weakness.
This progressed to the point that his right lower extremity was paretic, and the motor strength of his right upper extremity was anywherebetween 2-4/5.
Metastatic disease/melanoma was identified onCT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, and a lesion on the MRIof his cervical spine which seemed to be extramedullary but intradural.
Posterior cervical laminectomy, C4, C5, C6, resection of extramedullary intradural spinal cord tumor was performed.
Pathology returned consistent with metastasis of melanoma.
Patient noted on subsequent head CT's to have blood in ventricles which as per neurosurgical service was to be expected post-operatively.
Patient was closely monitored for neuro changes and evidence of hydrocephalus.
Repeat head Ct's did not demonstrate evidence of hydrocephalus and serial neuro exams were unchanged.
Post surgery, patient's admission complaint of right-sided weakness mildly improved and remained stable.
Some left sided weakness as well.
Metastatic Melanoma: He has had 3 separate melanoma lesions which have been excised (most recently 6 weeks ago).
Staging CT on admission showed extensive metastatic disease throughout chest and abdomen.
On [**3-23**] question of possible bowel/bladder incontinenece.
MRI of L and T spine obtained on [**3-25**] and demonstrated drop mets in cauda equina.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], oncologist, covering for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1729**], was made aware of new CNS findings and treatment options were re-considered.
He continues to have right-sided weakness which is slightly improved post surgery.
Respiratory Failure: After resection of intradural mass, patient developed respiratory distress on [**3-8**] requiring intubation and transfer to Medical ICU.
The patient had self-d/ced his NGtube while getting tubefeeds.
He was largely asymptomatic, exam was much improved and repeat chest x-rays demonstrated resolution of pneumonia.
HTN: Pt was mildly hypertensive on admission.
Post operatively while on neurosurgical and MICU services, patient's blood pressure became difficult to control.
Altered mental status attributed to sedating meds, pneumonia, long hospital course and metastatic melanoma.
Additionally, developed hyponatremia secondary to SIADH.
On [**3-17**] patient was found to be more confused, lethargic and there was concern for acute event.
Patient had extensive work-up at that time including repeat head CT, LP, EKG, ABG, toxic-metabolic work-up which revealed no significant new cause of altered mental status.
Ceftazidime was given for 2 days around this period after LP returned large number of white cells with lymphocytic predominance.
Ultimately, however, in consultation with neurology and neurosurgery, determination was made that given patient afebrile with no new significant signs or symptoms, infectious meningitis was not likely.
White cells consistent with inflammation from surgery.
He did continue to have some confusion, but his delirium was improving.
Demonstrates some delirium but is generally oriented, re-directable and logical in thought process.
6.Hyponatremia: Patient developed hyponatremia secondary to SIADH.
As above, felt to be contributory to altered mental status.
No significant bleeding complications.
Patient has expressed desires to minimize treatments and maximize palliative efforts.
Given his continued delirious state, however, wife's input as spouse and health care proxy is also determinant of future care.
Likely very limited treatment options.
The medical team following including PCP will need to be involved in evaluating patient while at rehab with possible transition to hospice care if patient not regaining strenght or deteriorating.
However, pt reports that he had severe difficulty urinating following general anesthesia in the past.
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 3 ml IV DAILY:PRN Peripheral IV - Inspect site every shift   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospital of [**Location (un) **] & Islands - [**Location (un) 6251**]  Discharge Diagnosis: malignant melanoma, pneumonia, hyponatremia, hypertension, delirium   Discharge Condition: Stable, residual right hemiparesis, restricted diet  Discharge Instructions: Contact MD if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath or if you experience any new weakness or sensory changes or any other concerning symptoms.
At this point, there are no realistic treatment options.
