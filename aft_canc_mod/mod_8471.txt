Triggered in triage for hypotension 70/40s.
Had tender abdomen, leukocytosis with left shift, though likley source of infection SBP.
Pt also noted to have guaiac positive (brown), has history of AVMs in cecum, GI informed, recommended calling liver fellow.
No CP, no ecg changes.
Of note pt was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after hospitalization for abd pain, initially thought to have SBP with negative paracentesis, after d/c c. diff cultures returned positive and pt was contact[**Name (NI) **] and prescribed PO vancomycin.
Wife states that pt is confused at baseline and endorses several falls in the past week, states he has had copious diarrhea but this is in the setting of lactulose use.
The patient denies HA, +mildly worsening SOB, no cough or sputum production, no nausea or vomiting.
Mild abd pain.
His chief complaint is left flank/hip pain at site of fall today.
Cirrhosis - grade 2 varices - h/o HCC metastatic to spine, back pain - h/o hepatic encephalopathy - difficult to control ascites requiring q2 week paracenteses - Portal vein thrombosis (R,L, main); No anticoag due to bleeding risk.

Neck: [**Month/Day (2) **], JVP to 12cm, left IJ in place Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally, no wheezes, ronchi or rales Cardiac: RR, nl S1 S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated Abdomen: + distended, ascites, non-tense.
Minimally TTP diffusely, no rebound or guarding.
Mild suprapubic tenderness.
Extremities: No edema, 2+ radial, DP pulses b/l Lymphatics: No cervical, supraclavicular, axillary or inguinal lymphadenopathy noted Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Neurologic: Alert, confused with poor attention and short term memory.
No evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Heart size appears mildly enlarged.
There is extensive widening of the mediastinum, which when compared with subsequently obtained CT scan is secondary to an unfolded thoracic aorta.
Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted along the thoracic aorta.
Please note, subacute appearing right anterior rib fractures are better visualized on CT scan performed subsequently.
CT head:FINDINGS: There is no evidence for hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are mildly enlarged secondary to involutional changes.
There is atherosclerotic disease in the cavernous carotid arteries.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for hemorrhage or mass effect.
CT Chest/abd/pelvis: WET READ no evidence for acute injury.
moderate ascites measures simple fluid.
large mass in right hepatic lobe, enlarged from [**2201-4-20**] consistent with hepatoma.
limited evaluation given no contrast.
Mild T4 compression deformity, unchanged from chest x-ray [**2201-7-6**], probably getting slightly worse over time, fx new from [**2201-1-27**].
Unchanged metastasis L3.
Dense atherosclerotic disease.
New 1cm right adrenal nodule.
The pelvis is slightly rotated, which limits evaluation.
Only minimal degenerative changes are noted at the lower lumbar spine and bilateral hip joints.
Vascular calcifications are also noted in the pelvis and proximal thighs.
Low voltage with diffuse TWF, no change from prior.
Brief Hospital Course: 84M with ESLD with refractory ascites and metastatic HCC, recent c. diff p/w falls, hypotension now post-ICU s/p likely septic shock, now DNR/DNI and eventually made [**Year (4 digits) 3225**].
SEPTIC SHOCK: In the ICU, pt was found to be in severe septic shock, hypotension not responsive to IVF, presented to ED on 2 pressors, hypothermic with increase in his baseline leukocytosis with 5% bandemia.
Pt had empiric coverage for his C.dif started with PO vanco and IV flagyl, and were investigating source of sepsis.
Alternatively adrenal insufficinecy in setting of known malignancy was considered.
Pt also developed ARF thought to be end organ dysfxn in setting of hypotension/sepsis.
ESLD: Pt had poor prognosis even at time of admission from how severe his end-stage liver disaseas was.
Pt had a h/o of [**Year (4 digits) **] cirrhosis c/b metastatic HCC s/p RFA.
Pt normally gets therapuetic paracentesis q 2 weeks.
Pt became more somnolent and with poor progonosis family decided to make pt [**Name (NI) 3225**].
Pt died [**1-24**] cardiopulmonary arrest as the immediate cause of death, and from longstanding ELSD with HCC.
GIB: Pt had anemia below baseline at 23.7.
Pt has h/o portal hypertension with known varices, also with known cecal AVMs p/w guaiac + brown stool.
ORAL THRUSH: Pt was found to have thrush which was treated with fluconazole, and helpt his speech.
