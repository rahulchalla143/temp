Admission Date:  [**2137-3-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-4-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2061-2-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Tetracycline Analogues / Atrovent / Chlorhexidine / Cephalosporins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3918**] Chief Complaint: Palpitations/tachycardia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 76 yo M with history of AML, MDS, and prostate cancer who presents to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with palpitations after he had been sent home from [**Hospital1 3242**] outpatient clinic after assessment for dyspnea and fevers.
According to patient's wife, the patient had been cleared to go home from [**Hospital1 3242**] outpatient clinic after a CXR was unrevealing, though the patient was only home for a coupld of hours prior to feeling acutely unwell and EMS was called.
At presentation to the ED, patient was noted to have HR of 150 and EKG consistent with atrial flutter and was started on an amiodarone bolus and infusion.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: # AML status post induction with 7 and 3 on [**2134-12-5**].
Family History: Father died of lung cancer at age 44.
Pulm: Scattered crackles Abd: Soft, NT/ND, no rebound/guarding Extremities: WWP, 1+ pitting LE edema bilaterally.
This may account for increased bibasilar opacitites, though new consolidation should also be considered.
Right apical opacity is likely unchanged, though is now partially obscured by overlying soft tissue artifact.
There is no large effusion or pneumothorax.
There is no free air in the upper abdomen.
IMPRESSION: Persistent right apical opacity with apparent new bibasilar opacities, which may in part reflect atelectasis in conjunction with low lung volumes.
Repeat PA and lateral radiographs with better inspiration would be helpful for further evaluation.
Pulmonary vascularity is also within normal limits.
Lung volumes are increased compared to the recent radiograph, and recently described new bibasilar opacities have nearly resolved with only minimal linear atelectasis remaining.
Poorly defined right apical opacity has slightly decreased in size since prior studies and is likely due to slowly resolving infection based on appearance on [**2137-3-2**] chest CT. Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally.
Near resolution of bibasilar opacities which were likely due to atelectasis.
Right apical opacity, likely due to slowly resolving infection.
Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Patient presented to ED primarily because of new palpitations at home which was proven to be atrial fibrillation with RVR as well as one documented episode of atrial flutter.
The patient was switched to oral amiodarone after having converted to sinus.
Pt was not not discharged on amio given that he converted prior to receiving his 1st dose and we thought the benefits did not outweight the drawbacks given his baseline pulmonary disease and overall decreased life expectancy.
Anemia: Pt has long term anemia with frequent outpatient transfusions related to MDS.
Febrile neutropenia with pneumonia: Patient with ANC of 60 at presentation and spiked a fever to 100.8 in the ED and pneumonia on CXR.
Patient with reported end-stage MDS and AML and will be difficult for him to mount a response to any infection.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital **] Home Health Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Atrial flutter Pneumonia  Secondary Diagnosis: Acute Myelogenous Leukemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for palpitations, and were found to be in a rapid heart rhythm called atrial flutter.
You received medications for the rapid heart rhyrhm and your heart rate converted back to normal.
You had no further symptoms other than shortness of breath, and you received a dose of medication called Lasix to remove fluid from your lungs.
Your chest xray from admission showed a possible pneumonia, and a repeat chest xray in the hospital was more consistent with residual findings from a resolving pneumonia you had previously rather than a new pneumonia.
However, due to your frequent neutropenia and pneumonia infections, it was felt best to re-start you on antibiotics until follow-up with your primary outpatient oncologist.
