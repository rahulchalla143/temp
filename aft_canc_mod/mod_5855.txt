Admission Date:  [**2124-1-26**]     Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2069-5-9**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54 year old male with multiple medical problems transferred from [**Hospital1 33995**] for management of left ventricular dysfunction and worsening renal failure.
The patient's history is notable for Hodgkin's disease at age 27, at which time he underwent mantel radiation and splenectomy.
Complications of radiation therapy included early coronary artery disease in [**2115**], with an inferior myocardial infarction complicated by a left ventricular thrombus, history of left circumflex stent placed in 03/00, ICD implant as well for nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and inducible ventricular tachycardia in Electrophysiology Laboratory.
The patient presented in [**Month (only) 205**] with pulmonary edema, acute renal failure, evaluated by catheterization revealing ejection fraction of 30%, restrictive hemodynamics.
He ultimately underwent pericardial stripping and received at St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] prosthetic mitral and tricuspid valve.
His most recent prior to this admission that I am dictating was [**12-2**], and it was notable for congestive heart failure/renal failure.
He had trials of multiple regimens to improve left ventricular dysfunction and increase renal perfusion.
His hospital course was also notable for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive sputum and excessive bleeding on Coumadin, thus making him not an anticoagulation candidate.
Ultimately he was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] Rehabilitation for further management and returned to [**Hospital1 1444**] after four to five days of worsening renal function with a creatinine that was 3.4, up from his discharge creatinine of 1.2 and his baseline at [**Hospital1 5593**] of 1.5 and also elevated blood urea nitrogen at 186.
Coronary artery disease history, status post inferior myocardial infarction in [**2115**], complicated by left ventricular thrombus and cerebrovascular accident.
History of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and inducible ventricular tachycardia, status post ICD in 03/00.
History of constrictive pericarditis and valvular dysfunction secondary to mantel radiation therapy, status post mitral valve replacement, tricuspid valve replacement, both St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**], pericardial stripping [**2123-8-10**].
The patient not anticoagulated because of consistent bleeding risk.
History of congestive heart failure, ejection fraction 20 to 30%.
History of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.
History of aspiration pneumonia, status post tracheostomy and status post percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement.
History of iron deficiency anemia.
No alcohol and no tobacco and no intravenous drug abuse.
Extremities - cachectic, no edema, bilateral heel ulcers.
Skin - bilateral left upper and lower extremity warm and well perfused.
The patient had a differential of 81 neutrophils, 1 bands, 12 eosinophils, 3 lymphocytes with positive toxic granulation.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for possible Dobutamine or Dopamine trial.
Initially, his urinary output was on the low side making 500 ccs in his first twelve hours in the Intensive Care Unit ultimately with the creatinine that stayed stable or elevated to 3.4 on [**2124-1-27**].
On deciding this, we gave him fluid and the patient started to have a slightly increased urinary output with a total of 796 on his second hospital day although his creatinine remained stable.
The patient had a blood pressure that continued to be on the low side even for him though there have been frequent issues in the past of him being hypotensive while still perfusing his brain and also having good renal function.
Also because of peripheral vascular disease, his blood pressure tends to run about 30 to 40 points lower than his A line tracing when he was on the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] on a prior admission.
He, however, continued to have a blood urea nitrogen elevated to 148.
It was felt that he had a large decubitus on his back.
He also was noted to have a heel ulcer that was evaluated by podiatry.
Ultimately, he had noninvasive arterial studies that revealed iliac disease bilaterally.
We are still awaiting the podiatry plan regarding his heel ulcer given that it is down to his bone and does qualify as an osteomyelitis.
Ultimately his Captopril was discontinued and on renal consultation it was noted that the patient had high eosinophils peripherally, eosinophils in his urine, prompting them to discontinue his Zosyn and his Celexa for fear that those were causes interstitial nephritis.
Endocrine was also asked to see the patient because of his profound hypothyroidism with both reduced T3 and T4 and very elevated TSH, ultimately recommending intravenous repletion of his thyroid hormone.
He was started on Levofloxacin, Flagyl and Vancomycin, the Vancomycin dosed for levels because of his osteomyelitis in his heel and because of his sacral decubitus.
The patient's white count remained stable and he has been afebrile throughout his entire course.
He has several swabs that are growing Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus from his heel.
He has a sputum culture that is growing Klebsiella sensitive to Ceftazidime only in his sputum and a pseudomonas growing from his sacral decubitus that is highly resistant with sensitivity to Gentamicin.
