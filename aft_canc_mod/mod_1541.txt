Gastrointestinal was consulted and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done, which initially showed Dieulafoy lesion in the body of the stomach, which was treated with thermotherapy to stop the bleeding.
Subsequently the patient had a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which showed pinpoint areas of bleeding around the lesion site.
The patient did not have any further bright red blood per rectum or hematemesis.

He did not have any repeat NSVT episodes.
He was ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
His antihypertensive medication was also held due to hemodynamic instability from gastrointestinal bleeding.

On admission his white blood cell count was significantly increased to greater then 70,000 with a lymphocytic predominance.
Acute renal failure:  Patient was in mild acute renal failure on admission.
This was likely due to a hypovolemic state from significant gastrointestinal bleeding he had.
