No tob or IVDU.
C DIFF NEGATIVE X 3 BLOOD CX [**2136-9-11**]: NO GROWTH URINE CX [**2136-9-10**]: CONTAMINATED.
There is a left-sided subclavian line with its tip in the region of the left brachiocephalic vein just short of midline.
No focal consolidation or other acute cardiopulmonary process.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
A bone stimulator is present with the electrodes seen along the junction of the tibia and hindfoot.
Postoperative change involving the second through fifth metatarsals remains similar in appearance.
The left- sided single lumen chest port was noted to have an access needle in place underneath the transparent dressing.
No superior vena cava obstruction is seen.
No evidence of SVC stenosis.
There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the axilla, mediastinum, or hilum.
Scattered shotty mediastinal lymph nodes, all less than a centimeter in short axis.
There is prominent coronary artery and diffuse vascular calcification.
Mild emphysema.
There are several tiny pulmonary nodules less than 5 mm in diameter.
Tiny (2-mm) pulmonary nodules in the right lower lobe (9, 37), and left lower lobe (9, 40).
Tiny nonspecific subpleural nodular opacity in the right upper lobe (9, 25).
Extensive calcified pleural plaques, likely the sequela of prior asbestos exposure.
CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Non-contrast portion of the scan demonstrates diffuse dense vascular calcification, gallstones, and large right-sided renal calculi, one within the pelvis at the mid pole and the other within the proximal ureter.
There are some surrounding inflammatory changes, but no evidence of significant hydronephrosis from these calculi.
Small non- obstructing left-sided calculi are also present.
Contrast-enhanced portion through the abdomen demonstrates a nodular liver with volume redistrubution with patchy perfusion of the peripheral aspect of the right lobe, and it is difficult to exclude an infiltrating lesion, especially in segment V/VI.
Additionally, there are several small hypoattenuating lesions within segment [**Last Name (LF) 7060**], [**First Name3 (LF) 690**], III, and VI, which are too small to characterize.
While these lesions may represent small cysts or hemangiomas, metastases are not excluded.
No thrombus is visualized within the hepatic veins.
Minimal fullness of the anterior limb of the left adrenal gland without distinct nodularity.
There are several tiny shotty mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, most prominent around the celiac axis, however, none are pathologically enlarged by CT criteria.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is circumferential mural thickening around the proximal sigmoid, concerning for primary colon cancer.
There are diffuse diverticuli in this region, but no surrounding stranding to suggest acute diverticulitis.
However, more superiorly along the lateral aspect of the descending colon, there are mild inflammatory changes and fluid, nonspecific in nature.
Within the pelvis, there are small subcentimeter, but borderline left retroperitoneal nodes, measuring up to 8 mm in diameter.
Additionally, in the left deep pelvis just medial to the lower pole of the left kidney and at the level of the aortic bifurcation, there is a 3.3 x 3.3 well- circumscribed cystic lesion demonstrating a dense fluid level dependently, which could represent a necrotic lymph node.
Remainder of the colon demonstrates no evidence of other areas of lesions or mural thickening.
There are vascular borderline enlarged bilateral inguinal lymph nodes.
BONE WINDOWS: There are diffuse degenerative changes and evidence of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis involving the thoracic levels anteriorly, but no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
Isolated hyperdense focus in the right femur is likely a bone island.
IMPRESSION: 1) 4-cm segment of circumferential wall thickening involving the proximal sigmoid colon, presumably corresponding to the concerning mass seen on colonoscopy.
2) Nodular liver with volume redistribution suggestive of cirrhosis.
Trace ascites and splenomegaly.
3) Heterogeneous perfusion of the peripheral right lobe of the liver, most prominent in segment VI; difficult to exclude an infiltrating lesion; additionally there are several small hypoattenuating lesions in both lobes, too small to characterize; MRI is recommended for further characterization.
4) Approximately 3-cm well-circumscribed cystic lesion medial to the lower pole the left kidney, of uncertainty etiology; possibly a duplication cyst or necrotic lymph node.
4) Borderline enlarged, hyperperfusing inguinal lymphadenopathy and subcentimeter, nonspecific left retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
5) Several small (<5mm) pulmonary nodules bilaterally; short term follow-up is recommended.
6) Right renal parenchymal and proximal collecting system calculi.
Brief Hospital Course: # CHRONIC LEFT FOOT OSTEOMYELITIS WITH CHARCOT FOOT DEFORMITY: Patient was admitted for left tibeocalcaneal fusion for treatment.
His surgery was complicated by 2 L estimated blood loss intraoperatively with subsequent hypotension requiring ICU admission.
He has been afebrile and wbc stable.
His pain is controlled with prn oxycodone.
# ACUTE BLOOD LOSS ANEMIA / HYPOTENSION / COLON MASS: Patient had an estimated 2 liter blood loss intraoperatively.
He had been transfused preop for hct 27, given history of bleeding with surgery but postop hct 26.
Patient was hypotensive to sbp 70s-80s requiring ICU admission for levophed to maintain MAP > 60.
Suspect component of anesthesia, pain med, and blood loss were all contributors.
His hematocrit slowly trended down on the floor with guaic positive stool and minimal bleeding on the bandage.
GI was consulted and did a colonoscopy in house which showed an erythematous, friable, protruding, malignant appearing circumferential mass with ulceration and contact bleeding in the mid sigmoid at 30 cm.
CT torso shows no clear mets but possible liver lesions which will be assessed intraoperatively by biopsy or ultrasound if the patient wishes to pursue operative treatment.
EGD showed erythema, granularity, and congestion in the stomach body compatible with gastritis and gastric erosion with active oozing of blood.
# Thrombocytopenia - Platelets decreased from 261 to 67 postop.
He had no further bleeding in the setting of his low platelets and thus did not require a platelet transfusion.
# Coagulopathy: INR also slightly elevated preop, as well as PTT.
# Diastolic CHF: Patient is preload dependent.
# PPX - Lovenox for DVT ppx until ambulating.
# Access - PICC in place .
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for pain: hold for rr < 8 or oversedation.
