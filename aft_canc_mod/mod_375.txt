Large, heterogeneous mass involving the majority of the right lobe of the liver.
Tumor/thrombus with expansion within the inferior vena cava extending to the right atrium.
This constellation of findings is concerning for large infiltrative hepatocellular carcinoma.
Left lower lobe pulmonary embolism, not completely evaluated on this CT of the abdomen and pelvis.
Bilateral pleural effusion.
Diffuse colitis extending from the cecum to the splenic flexure.
Differential diagnosis includes infectious, venous congestion and intramural hemorrhage.
Left basal artery pulmonary emboli.
Large heterogeneous mass in right lobe of the liver with associated tumor thrombus in right atrium.
Brief Hospital Course: HCC: Pt presented with epigastric discomfort, fecal incontinence, and anemia.
To evaluate this a CT of the abdomen was done on [**7-16**], which incidentally showed an infiltrating large heterogeneous mass involving the majority of the right lobe of the liver.
There was a filling defect with expansion of the portal vein and and of the hepatic vein extending to the inferior vena cava, consistent with tumor thrombus.
This was presumed to be advanced stage Hepatocellular carcionma with intravascualar extension, along with Budd-Chiari syndrome due to occlusion of the portal vein.
Pt was also found to have a LLL PE which was confirmed by a CT chest.
Thirdly, pt was found to have diffuse colitis extending from the cecum to the splenic flexure.
Pt subsequently had hematemesis pt was given 2 units PRBC, and did not become hypotensive.
On EGD he was found to have esophagitis and two non-bleeding varices.
Patient had 2 episodes of hematemesis.
Scope showed Grade 2 non-bleeding gastric varices, esophageal varices likely cause of bleed Once his hematemesis resolved he was restarted on heparin for anticoagulation for his portal vein thrombosis and PE.
The cause of the bleeding was attributed to the pt's esophageal varices .
After discharge from the MICU until discharge pt did not have any subsequent episodes of hematemesis at all.
With pt's CT findings and AFP 2178, Hepatocellular Carcioma was confirmed without need of tissue diagnosis.
Possible treatment with sorafenib (monoclonal ab as chemotherapy that would extend survival for possibly weeks), but at the time it was not safe to be started due to the increased bleeding risk as an adverse effect of this medicaiton.
The first was to prolong survival as much as possible - to do so pt would need multiple banding by EGD to reduce risk of bleeding so that sorafinab could be given.
LE edema: Pt also developed lower extremity edema and scrotal swelling.
This was thought secondary to the pt's IVC and portal vein thrombosis along with ESRD.
If the edema is primary due to the thrombosis causing (vs. ESLD) diuretics may not significantly help.
There was some improvement of there LE edema on day of dishcarge and expect this to improve.
Family is aware of the risk of massive PE and is opting for comfort care measures as discused above.
Colitis: Initially it was unclear if the diffuse colitis was due to infectious causes.
Diffuse colitis extending from the cecum to the splenic flexure.
The differential diagnosis includes infectious vs. ischemic causing venous congestion and intramural hemorrhage.
In the end it was concluded that the colitis was [**1-3**] the portal vein thrombosis causing venous congestion and intramural hemorrhage.
Pt did not complain of any melana, hematochezia, or left sided abdominal pain even on dishcarge.
He apparently was taking a topical antibiotic for his dental infection, as well as one pill for his itchy skin, and topical cream for skin.
Simethicone 80 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for bloating.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
