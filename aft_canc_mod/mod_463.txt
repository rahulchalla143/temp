HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69 year old female who was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital6 649**] with acute renal failure.
She was taken to the Operating Room and found to have bilateral ureteral obstruction at the base of her bladder from presumably a bladder primary carcinoma.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Multiple sclerosis; hypertension; noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus; breast cancer, status post lumpectomy and radiation in [**2174**] with Tamoxifen therapy; chronic renal insufficiency; history of an upper gastrointestinal bleed with gastritis; history of recent aspiration pneumonia.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Her pain was controlled with intermittent Morphine pulses and she remained intubated for two days postoperatively.
She received aggressive chest physiotherapy and continued to improve from a respiratory standpoint.
On postoperative day #5, she had had a small bowel movement and her diet was advanced to sips of clear liquids.
The patient developed no pain in the upcoming 12 hours, and on postoperative day #7, the right nephrostomy tube was removed.
There was no leakage from this site and a dressing was applied.
The decision was made to leave this tube in place as this is her healthier kidney and providing most of her renal function.
In the event that she should develop left flank pain it could easily be uncapped and placed to gravity drainage.
The morning of postoperative day #8 her [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was removed as it was draining small amounts of fluid and the creatinine from this fluid revealed it was consistent with peritoneal fluid and not urine.
Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with decreased effort.
Her abdomen is soft, nontender and slightly obese.
Her midline incision is clean, dry and intact with staples.
Her extremities are warm and well perfused with trace edema bilaterally.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  All of her preoperative medications without change as well as stoma supplies.
Nutrition - The patient is advanced to a house diet, but her intake has been somewhat questionable, secondary to decreased appetite.
Should the patient develop left flank pain or have minimal output from her loop for an extended period of time, the left nephrostomy could be placed back to gravity drainage but we would like to keep this capped in an effort to have it removed at the postoperative visit.
