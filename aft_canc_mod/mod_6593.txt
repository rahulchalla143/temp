Admission Date:  [**2196-9-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2196-10-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2151-12-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Dilaudid  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3227**] Chief Complaint: confusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**9-27**]: left parietal craniotomy   History of Present Illness: 44 right handed male with hx of melanoma metastatic to the brain treated with surgical resection and CyberKnife, presented originally with R arm numbness and weakness, now transferred from an OSH after his wife noticed that he was acutely confused around 1AM this morning.
911 was called and he was brought to [**Hospital3 **], where a CT scan of the head revealed 1.7 cm R frontal hemorrhage and 3.9 cm L fronto-parietal hemorrhage with associated edema with local effacement of sulci without midline shift.
Currently he attests to feeling confused, but denies any dizziness, nausea, visual changes, or headache.
MRI [**2196-7-19**] showed 3 lesions - 2 in the left parietal and 1 in the right frontal regions.
A repeat MRI on [**8-3**] showed slight increase in the size of both tumors, and a third MRI [**9-5**] showed a new right parietal metastasis.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Reflexes: B T Br Pa Ac Right     2+     2+ 2+ Left      2+     2+ 2+  Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements, heel to shin  Exam upon discharge: Alert, Oriented to person, place and date, with minimal prompting.
Over the short interval, the hemorrhagic left temporoparietal lesion has substantially increased in size, now measuring at least 4.0 cm (AP) x 2.6 cm (TRV), with substantial hemorrhagic component and significant associated vasogenic edema and increased mass effect upon the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and atrium of the left lateral ventricle (4:15).
Similarly, the lesion in the right frontal lobe, which measured only 8 mm, is significantly larger, now measuring 17 x 16 mm, and also demonstrates significant hemorrhagic (and/or melanotic) component with small zone of vasogenic edema which, too, has substantially increased since the recent study.
There has been no significant interval growth in the small lesion in the central aspect of the right parietal lobe, adjacent to the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of that lateral ventricle, and no new enhancing lesion is identified.
There is no restricted diffusion to indicate acute ischemia and the principal intracranial vascular flow voids, including those of the dural venous sinuses, are preserved and these structures enhance normally.
IMPRESSION: Marked short-interval progression of the hemorrhagic and/or melanotic dominant left temporoparietal and right frontal metastases, now measuring up to 4.0 and 1.7 cm, respectively.
There is corresponding significant interval increase in associated vasogenic edema, but no overall shift of midline structures or evident herniation.
6 mm right apical lung nodule is unchanged since [**2196-7-21**].
There are no other lung nodules.
Small bilateral effusions have resolved since [**2196-7-21**].
Heart size is mildly enlarged.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Scattered central nodes do not meet CT size criteria for enlargement.
There is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.
The abdominal loops of bowel are unremarkable without evidence of obstruction or free air.
Well circumscribed fluid density (20 [**Doctor Last Name **])3.4 X 1.9 cm and 2 x 1.7 cm lesions adjacent to the left adrenal gland and superior to the pancreas, respectively (2:54), are new since [**2196-7-21**].
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Bone windows demonstrate no lesion concerning for metastasis or infection.
No new lesion concerning for metastasis.
Segment VII liver lesion likely represents flash filling hemangioma given similar enhancement to blood pool, but is not fully characterized.
MRI suggested for more definitive characterization given history of malignancy.
New fluid density collections near the pancreas likely represent pancreatic pseudocysts.
MRI Head [**9-28**](post-op): FINDINGS: There is a new left parietal/temporal craniotomy, with associated post-operative changes in the overlying scalp.
The previously noted left parietal/temporal mass has been resected.
This limits evaluation for any residual enhancing tumor components on the post-contrast T1-weighted images, though none definitively seen.
An apparent 5 mm focus of slow diffusion along the anterolateral margin of the new resection cavity (image 12 of series 700 and series 702), most likely represents an artifact related to the post-operative blood products, although a small contusion or infarction of adjacent tissue cannot be excluded.
There is high T2 signal surrounding the new resection cavity, likely representing a combination of post-operative edema and pre-existing tumor-related and therapy-related changes.
There is a minimal decrease in mass effect following the new resection.
The pre-existing left parietal resection cavity, superior to the new cavity, appears stable, with linear enhancement along its margins.
The hemorrhagic lesion in the right frontal lobe is unchanged in the interim (image 9:19).
Enhancing and hemorrhagic lesions in the right parietal lobe (image 9:17) and in the left frontal lobe (image 1000:50) are unchanged.The ventricles are stable in size.
The major arterial flow voids are unremarkable.There is mild mucosal thickening in the maxillary sinuses.
Status post left parietal/temporal mass resection, with blood products in the resection cavity limiting evaluation for any residual enhancing components.
The other previously noted hemorrhagic masses are unchanged in the short interim.
MRI Abdomen [**9-29**]: There is minimal dependent atelectasis at the right lung base.
There is a subcapsular lesion measuring 10 x 10 mm in segment VIII of the liver, corresponding to the enhancing abnormality on prior CT, which demonstrates uniform high signal on T2- weighted images, low signal on T1- weighted sequences and arterial phase hyperenhancement with continued enhancement on the dynamic series.
The appearance is consistent with a hemangioma (image 41, series 100).
A 1.4-mm lesion in segment II of the liver also shows features consistent with a hemangioma.
There are scattered up to 3 mm hepatic cysts which demonstrate low signal on T1- weighted sequences and high signal on T2-weighted sequences without enhancement (image 37, 41 and 56, series 300).
There are again demonstrated peripancreatic fluid collections which have high signal on T1-weighted sequences, low signal on T2-weighted sequences and demonstrate subtle rim enhancement suggestive of focal collections with hemorrhagic or proteinaceous contents.
The pancreatic parenchyma shows homogeneous enhancement.
There is no upper abdominal lymphadenopathy.
The visualized loops of bowel appear unremarkable.
Additional simple hepatic cysts and hemangiomas as described above.
Hemorrhagic or proteinaceous peripancreatic collections which may represent sequelae of pancreatitis.
He was initially agitated secondary to steroids, and IV ativan, seroquel, and haldol were started and the steroids were subsequently stopped.
His keppra was increased to 1000mg, and a 1000mg bolus was given for a possible focal seizure in his RUE.
The patient went to the operating room on Tuesday, [**9-27**] for a resection of a L parietal mass.
An MRI of the Head and Abdomen were ordered d/t concerning findings of a Segment VII liver lesion per CT Scan.
This MRI revealed mutliple small cysts that did not required acute intervention per the GI team.
The patient was given instruction for these findings to be followed from an outpaient standpoint.
At the time of discharge, the patient continues to experience mild sensory ataxia of his right hand (though the ataxia had improved significantly post-resection)  Medications on Admission: Keppra 500'', Decadron taper finished the day before admission.
