Of note, in [**10-9**] he developed RUQ pain, leukocytosis, fever, was at [**Hospital 2079**] Hospital but referred here for ERCP with sphincterotomy, though it was felt that this was not the cause of his infection.
He returned to [**Hospital1 34**] and had a cholecystectomy, which was complicated, requiring prolonged rehab stay for learning to eat and walk again.
Over the past 6-7 days he has had decreased appetite, decreased intake, chills and diarrhea.

There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2142-3-10**] CTA head/neck IMPRESSION:  Mild plaquing at bilateral carotid bifurcations in the neck.
No intracranial aneurysm.
Rapid increase in size of the pseudoaneurysm noted arising from the arch of  the aorta, today measuring 4.6 x 5.4 x 4.5 cm, previously 3.8 x 3.5 x 3.1 cm  n [**2141-3-7**] on OSH CT.  2.
[**2142-3-11**] Intra-op TEE: Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is a large saccular aneurysm measuring approximately 5.29 x 3.88cm in the distal arch & proximal descending aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There is acoustic shadowing in the distal arch and upper descending aorta consistent with a tube graft.
[**2142-3-30**] CT Chest: IMPRESSION: Minimal decrease in size in an air- and fluid-containing thick-walled paramediastinal space at the site of prior pseudoaneurysm, this is as before inseparable from the aortic graft and concerning for infection with abscess formation.Right pneumonia, minimally improved.
Increasing consolidation in the left lower lobe is consistent with worsening pneumonia.
Improved soft tissue edema and probably hematoma in the left chest wall.

Please assess for interval change in fluid collection, rule out other source.
No supraclavicular, axillary or hilar lymphadenopathy evident.
Prominent lymph nodes are identified in the left paratracheal space; however, these do not meet CT criteria for pathological enlargement (2:23, 601B:28).
There is redemonstration of the thick-walled air fluid collection in the left paramediastinal space adjacent to the recently placed aortic graft.
Given obtuse angulation with the surrounding parenchyma, it appears to be within the mediastinal space.
Specifically, the air component has slightly decreased in size.
The appearance of peripheral enhancement is likely due to enhancing surrounding atelectasis though cannot definitively exclude associated rim enhancement, which would be suggestive of either superimposed infectious process or can also be associated with a chronic fluid collection.
Increased multifocal bilateral opacifications, worst in the lung bases with the greatest degree of change noted in the right lower lung and the left lower lung relatively stable.
Bibasilar consolidations are associated with low density bronchial impaction.
There is a decreased left pleural effusion, small in size with minimally improved adjacent compressive atelectasis in the peripheral left lower lobe.
The right pleural effusion has resolved.
No focal liver lesions identified.
Bilateral adrenal glands are normal.
A stable small hypodensity in the upper pole of the left kidney is too small to fully characterize and likely represents a simple renal cyst.
The small bowel has a suggestion of submucosal fatty infiltration within the terminal ileum, which may be associated with a chronic inflammatory disorder, though this is occasionally seen in asymptomatic patients.
No lymphadenopathy present.
No free air or free or loculated fluid identified within the abdomen.
The abdominal aorta has extensive vascular calcification throughout its length and is ectatic in its infrarenal portion.
A significant amount of calcification is identified at the ostia of the superior mesenteric and celiac arteries.
There is no evidence of critical stenosis.
No evidence of dissection.
No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions evident.
No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified.
Stable appearance of the size of left paramediastinal air-fluid collection.
Likely postoperative fluid collection given negative prior biopsy and culture though cannot exclude superimposed infectious process.
Minimally worsening multifocal opacifications particularly evident in the lung bases with bibasilar bronchial impaction, concerning for worsening pneumonia, possibly related to an aspiration pneumonitis.
Minimally decreased left nonhemorrhagic pleural effusion.

FINDINGS: The opacified pulmonary arteries appear patent to the subsegmental levels without evidence for pulmonary embolus.
There is improved aeration at the lung bases bilaterally with persistent left medial lower lung atelectasis.
There has been interval resolution of the left pleural effusion.
There is increased ground-glass and patchy confluent opacification in the right lower lobe and inferior right upper lobe, concerning for infection.
Underlying emphysematous changes are again noted.
Small lymph nodes adjacent to the para-aortic collection may be reactive and do not meet CT size criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Increased soft tissue density adjacent to the left main stem bronchus may represent reactive adenopathy.
Trace pericardial fluid is again noted.
Extensive dense coronary artery and aortic calcifications are again noted.
This study is not optimized for evaluation of subdiaphragmatic structures.
The visualized portions of the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and left kidney demonstrate no acute abnormalities.
No acute bony findings are detected.
Upper thoracic compression deformity is again noted.
No evidence for pulmonary embolus.
Increased ground-glass and minimally more confluent opacities in the right lower lobe and inferior right upper lobe, concerning for pneumonia.
Stable size of para-aortic post-operative collection with increased internal air and resolution of internal fluid.
Interval resolution of left pleural effusion.
No evidence for pulmonary embolus.
Increased ground-glass and minimally more confluent opacities in the right lower lobe and inferior right upper lobe, concerning for pneumonia.
Stable size of para-aortic post-operative collection with increased internal air and resolution of internal fluid.
Interval resolution of left pleural effusion.
Bronchocoscopy revealed copious secretions on the left.
He had a brief episode of atrial fibrillation which resolved with Metoprolol and Magnesium.
CTs were discontinued without complication.
He was re-intubated again on [**2142-3-21**] for respiratory failure.
Bronchoscopy yielded very thick secretions and blood clots from the right lower lobe.
He was treated empirically with a 10 day course of Vancomycin and flagyl  for persistent leukocytosis, fever and diarrhea.
The thoracotomy wound developed erythema and blistering.
Fluid was sent for culture, there was no growth.
Zyprexa was started for agitation with good effect.
