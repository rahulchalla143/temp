Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 64121**] Admission Date: [**2179-7-14**] Discharge Date: [**2179-7-29**] Date of Birth:  [**2100-10-28**] Sex: M Service:   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5586**] [**Known lastname 64122**] was a 78-year-old man with a past medical history of diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, AAA repair and colon cancer, who presented with fatigue and chest pain.
He initially presented to [**Hospital6 **], where he was found to have atrial fibrillation and a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with a troponin I of 0.91 and a CK of 84.
While at [**Hospital6 **] he developed recurrent symptoms and was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further care.
Upon his arrival he was found to have cardiogenic shock and was intubated and taken urgently for cardiac catheterization.
He was lying flat so jugular venous distention could not be evaluated.
There was no apparent goiter.
There were no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The abdomen was soft and mildly distended with normal bowel sounds.
There was no guarding.
Extremities were cool with dopplerable pulses.
PERTINENT LABORATORY/RADIOLOGY/OTHER FINDINGS:  His initial ECG on [**2179-7-15**], showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 110, there was a late transition consistent with possible prior anterior infarction, there was left axis deviation, nonspecific ST-T wave changes.
This showed severe 3 vessel disease with severe systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
This showed severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction on a poor quality study.
A repeat echocardiogram was performed later that day that confirmed left ventricular systolic dysfunction and found no significant valvular dysfunction.
He again went for cardiac catheterization on [**2179-7-15**], during which he had percutaneous intervention of the left main coronary artery, the left anterior descending, the left circumflex and a diagonal branch.
A chest x-ray was performed on [**2179-7-15**] which showed pulmonary edema and an intra-aortic balloon pump.
Another echocardiogram was performed on [**2179-7-16**], which again showed severe systolic dysfunction, with no significant valvular disease.
On [**2179-7-21**] a CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed a left upper lobe mass invading the left superior pulmonary vein, left iliac bone metastasis and liver lesions, likely metastases, and borderline thickening of the gallbladder.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 64123**] initially presented with cardiogenic shock in the setting of acute coronary syndrome.
Cardiac catheterization showed severe 3 vessel disease.
Over the next several days his cardiogenic shock improved and he was weaned off the intra-aortic balloon pump and pressors, however, he remained intubated due to hypoxia and congestive heart failure.
A CT of the chest and abdomen was obtained for further evaluation and demonstrated metastatic cancer.
The decision was made to treat him medically in consultation with his healthcare proxy, however, his hypoxia failed to improve.
Congestive heart failure.
Acute myocardial infarction.
Metastatic cancer from a probable lung source.
