Admission Date:  [**2192-12-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2192-12-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2120-3-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 832**] Chief Complaint: Fevers, chills, cough and weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 72-year-old male with AChR +ve myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], Duodenal angiomas, asthma, diastolic CHF and AF who presented following a 4 day hx of fever, chills, and generalized weakness.
Patient felt hot with chills past 2 nights for which he did not take his temperature but took acetamionophen for this.
He noticed increasing wheeze past 2 days and did feel more SOB yesterday with no cough, sputum or hemoptysis.
Since last night noted palpitations with an associated "funny feeling" in the chest.
He had further sweating, fever, palpitations and chest discomfort (again which was self-limiting lasting 2 minutes per pt) and called an ambulance.
Upon EMS arrival the patient was in a rapid AF with a heart rate about 130, O2 sat was approximately 95% on 4 L. Patient denies any chest pain, but noted mild difficulty breathing and mild nausea.
He denied emesis or abdominal pain.
No recent hospital admissions.
In the ED, patient was noted to have a low grade temp 100 and was in fast AF with rate 130's and 94% 3L NC.
CXR showed multifocal pneumonia.
ECG showed fast AF with no ischemic changes.
Regarding myasthenic sx pt noted increased generalised weakness past 4 days with no diplopia or blurred vision and no swallowing problems.
[**Name (NI) **] did not take any of his myasthenia meds until in the [**Hospital Unit Name **] which may account for his significant dysarthria although patient denies diplopia.
Patient was complaining of soem SOB and mild wheeze and otherwise not disturbed by tacycardia.
ROS: The patient denies any weight change, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity oedema, cough, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.
Past Medical History: ACh R Ab +ve Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] on azathioprine and pyridostigmine has had for 3 years and had trouble with left ptosis 2 years.
Diplopia resolved 2 years ago.
Has never required ICU treatment for his MG. Colonic Polyps Duodenal angiomas (s/p thermal therapy) GI bleeding - capsule endoscopy [**10/2192**] (for guaiac +ve stools) showed mild, focal gastritis and no active bleeding sites were found.
Gastritis HTN Asthma Constrictive pericarditis Chronic renal insufficiency Congestive heart failure diastolic Diverticular disease of the colon with a redundant colon Atrial fibrillation on diltiazem exudative pleural effusion .
h/o mild developmental delay, lives in [**Location (un) 453**] apt alone in [**Location (un) **] Smoking - Ex-smoker quit 16 years ago prev 2 cigars/day no ETOH, no illicits or IVDU.
Left intermittently complete ptosis HEENT: sclera anicteric, no epistaxis or rhinorrhea, MMM, OP Clear NECK: No JVD, carotid pulses brisk, no bruits, no cervical lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: RRR, no M/G/R, normal S1 S2, radial pulses +2.
JVP not elevated PULM: Markedly decreased BS L>R with crackles in left base and mild occasional wheeze.
Generally poor air entry bilaterally.
ABD: Soft, NT, ND, +BS, no HSM, no masses EXT: No C/C/E, no palpable cords.
CN II normal, complex ophthalmoplegia with significant limitation with some adduction and very limited abduction and R eye good abduction and 75% adduction with significantly limited elevation and depression of both eyes although patient cooperation was not ideal.
Left complete ptosis although intermittent and weakness in eye closure bilaterally L>R but otherwise facial muscle power good.
Somewhat impared sniff and good cough.
Power 4+/5 in shoulder abduction bilaterally and otherwise mild weakness in proximal muscles (Elbow F/E) bilaterally with good distal power.
Proximal weakness was fatiguable.
Reflexes present and symmetrical in UL and Difficult to ellicit in the lower limb due to poor patient compliance.
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2192-12-2**] 12:25 PM FINDINGS: There is a rounded opacity in the right upper lobe.
There is left basilar atelectasis.
Lung volumes are slightly low.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Right upper lobe consolidative opacity worrisome for pneumonia.
Recommend repeat chest radiograph after appropriate treatment to assess for resolution.
Left basilar atelectasis.
Left retrocardiac consolidation is unchanged.
Right basal atelectasis is unchanged.
[**2192-12-6**]: MRI BRAIN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The study is very limited, with incomplete diffusion imaging.
Within the limitations of obtaining only the directional sequence of the diffusion study, there is no evidence of acute infarction.
Non-contrast sagittal T1-weighted images show no mass effect or hematoma.
IMPRESSIONS: Very limited study due to early termination shows no evidence of acute infarction, mass effect, or hematoma.
Brief Hospital Course: 72-year-old male with AChR +ve myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], Duodenal angiomas, asthma, diastolic CHF and AF presents with fevers, chills and SOB and was found to be in fast AF with evidence of multifocal pneumonia on CXR.
Considerable myasthenic sx (not affecting respiratory muscles but had mild proximal fatiguable weakness) on admission but now improving with persistent eye signs.
# Multi-lobar Pneumonia with acute respiratory failure: Evidence of predominantly RUL consolidation but also left base changes in context of fevers, chills and worsening SOB.
WBC downtrending on hospital day 2 but CXR ppeared slightly worse with evidence of left base consolidation.
# Rapid Atrial Fibrillation: On home maintained on diltiazem 240mg [**Hospital1 **].
Current significant symptoms with complex ophthalmoplegia, ptosis and fatiguable proximal weakness with dysarthria.
Generally poor chest wall movement.
Baseline ABG obtained which was reassuring for intact respiratory status and showed respiratory alkalosis.
By Day 2 he had improved - no longer had proximal weakness but had persistent ocular symptosm with partial ptosis on left and very limited eye movement on the left especially in adduction and upgaze bilaterally.
# Gait ataxia.
This improved slowly with increased ambulation.
A partial MRI was completed, which showed no acute infarcts.
# HTN: On admission relatively hypotensive systolic pressures improved in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Held furosemide in setting of presenting hypotension thoguh this was restarted prior to discharge.
# Hx dCHF: furosemide was held during admission, with no signs of volume overload.
# Gastrointestinal bleeding, with history of angiomas.
On hospital day 4, he developed guaic positive stool.
He had a slow drift down in his hematocrit.
# Diarrhea.
The patient developed diarrhea occurring 3 times daily at the time of discharge.
It is most likely that this represents a mediation side effect potentially from glycopyrollate.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: ## Gastrointestinal bleeding ## Multifocal community acquired pneumonia with acute respiratory failure ## Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] with chronic ptosis of left eye, and weakness in setting of illness.
## Gait ataxia, ## Chronic diastolic CHF without acute exacerbation ## Atrial fibrillation with RVR, ## Stage II CKD, at baseline ## Chronic asthma without acute exacerbation.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with pneumonia and an exacerbation of your myasthenia.
The neurology team saw you, and you did not have any respiratory failure due to your myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**].
You also developed gastrointestinal bleeding likely due to your angiomas, while on heparin shots and aspirin.
