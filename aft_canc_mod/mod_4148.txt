Packed red blood cell transfusion   History of Present Illness: 53 year old male with history of cholangiocarcinoma on FLOX chemotherapy presented on day of arrival to oncology clinic with a few days of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy and fever.
In clinic he was found to be dehydrated, vomiting dark red emesis (consistent with possible old blood), and febrile (low grade).
He reports black watery stool over the past few days prior to admission as well.
At his last visit to oncology, he reported poor appetite with early satiety.
He also has mid abdominal pain worse with eating and nausea for which he takes compazine.
ROS is otherwise notable for subjective fevers for 2 days.
He denies any recent travel or sick contacts.
He reports undergoing EGD which showed question of metastatic gastric lesions that were bleeding.
In the ED:  Patient underwent 2 L gastric lavage and was still not clearing clots.
He was then admitted to the MICU for an emergent upper endoscopy, which demonstrated erosive esophagitis, gastritis, and compression by tumor, with ulceration around the stent in his biliary duct without evidence of bleeding.
Carpal tunnel syndrome.
Oncologic History:  Metastatic Cholangiocarcinoma: - initially presented with painless jaundice in [**4-4**].
Diagnosed via ERCP with cholangiocarcinoma -Klatskin-type tumor - [**5-5**], external and internal left and right transhepatic catheter drains - [**6-/2142**] - exploratory laparotomy - extensive tumor involvement of the right anterior branch of the hepatic duct as well as positive lymph nodes in the posterior duodenum.
It was determined based upon this that his cancer was unresectable.
- [**12-7**] gemcitabine and cisplatin - [**2-4**] disease progression on staging CT - [**3-7**] started on capecitabine monotherapy - [**3-7**] biochemical evidence of disease progression, changed to Taxotere 75 mg/m3 for three weeks.
No ST changes.
Upper endoscopy [**2144-8-21**]: Impression: Esophagitis Abnormal mucosa in the stomach Metal stent was seen in the biliary duct, with no evidence of bleeding from the duct, however there was ulceration on the mucosal fold across from the stent but no visable vessel or active bleeding.

It was also possible that there was a componenet of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 329**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear secondary to delayed nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy.
- Initally patient had melena and guaiac positive stools, thought to be secondary to his upper gastrointestinal source.
These cleared as treatment for his esophagitis and gastritis was initiated, and no further work-up was completed, as his bowel movements returned to baseline and were guaiac negative.
- Patient was counseled to avoid aspirin, NSAIDs, alcohol, or other anticoagulation.
# Metastatic Cholangiocarcinoma: - Patient was currently on FLOX (5-FU, folinic acid, and oxaliplatin) - received Cycle 1, day #15 on [**2144-8-14**].
- Patient was kept on zofran as needed for nausea.
# Atrial fibrillation/flutter: Patient was not on anticoagulated for his history of atrial fibrillation, and was initially on metoprolol for rate control.
The metoprolol was discontinued, however, due to low heart rate while not receiving any rate-controlling or nodal blocking agents.
He was noted to have episodes where his heart rate was in the 30's to 40's at the time when he broke into sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation.
# Fevers: Patient was noted to have a fever prior to admission, but remained afebrile during his stay in the ICU and on the floors.
Patient did not have any recurrence of his fever and was not started on any antibiotics.
# FEN:  Patient's hypokalemia aggressively treated, and was thought to be secondary to his gastrointestinal losses.
# Prophylaxis: Patient was continued on [**Hospital1 **] dosing of pantoprazole, as well as pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: - Gastritis Secondary Diagonses: - Cholangiocarcinoma - Atrial fibrillation - Upper gastrointestinal bleed   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted due to vomiting that was concerning for bleeding from your gastorintestinal tract.
You were started on medications to help with the pain and inflammation, and you should continue to take those unless directed otherwise.
Please call your primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] oncologist, or go to the emergency room if you experience any vomiting, bleeding, fevers, chills, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, or other concerning symptoms.
Please discuss re-starting your medication metoprolol (used for blood pressure control and to lower heart rate for atrial fibrillation) with Dr. [**Doctor Last Name 61950**] was stopped during this stay due to low heart rate.
