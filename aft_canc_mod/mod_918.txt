Also c/o difficulty catching his breath.
Says pain doesn't radiate anywhere.
Has chronic trouble with nausea/vomiting.
He states he has never had easy bleeding or bruising and denies history of GI bleeding other than small amounts due to hemhorroids.
Had CTA showing PE predominantly in L main PA w/ a small non-occlusive strand in the R main PA, and extension into LLL, LUL, and lingular branches.
2. smaller PE in the RML and RUL branches.
3. flattening of ventricular septum but no bowing into the LV to suggest R heart strain.

Imaging: [**5-24**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia with non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.
There is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
The aorta is of normal caliber along its course with no intramural hematoma or dissection.
The heart shows no pericardial effusion.
There is no pleural effusion.
Mild bibasilar atelectasis is demonstrated.
A large filling defect is seen in the left main pulmonary artery with a smaller contiguous component crossing over into the proximal right main pulmonary artery (3; 55).
Additionally, pulmonary emboli are seen in the right middle lobe, right upper lobe and right lower lobe branches.
The heart shows no bowing of the intraventricular septum in the left ventricle to suggest heart strain.
The visualized portion of the upper abdomen shows no gross abnormality.
No aggressive appearing lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen.
[**5-25**] CXR: Small left pleural effusion.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
58 y/o M with multiple myeloma s/p chemo and auto SCT [**4-27**] presenting with acute onset of CP found to have a PE on CTA.
#PE - likely related to underlying hypercoaguable state due to malignancy, though olanzipine was held given that it was only recently started.
Per CTA pt with large clot burden.
Hemodynamically stable throughout course, only with tachycardia upon arrival to the floor to 130s.
Echo shows no right heart strain.
Mainly, pt experiences intense L chest pain that is pleuritic in nature, which causes him to become very tachycardic and tachypneic (fast and shallow breaths to avoid the pain).
He doesn't experience much SOB from the PE other than when the pain becomes too much.
#Anemia:  mild crit drop on [**5-27**] am labs to slightly below his baseline.
He had no signs of acute bleed, and his vitals were stable.
#Fever:  Low grade temperature felt most likely to be a result of clot burden, but may also be an infectious etiology.
A CXR and CTA were without infiltrate.
No infectious signs or symptoms on exam.
#Nausea/vomiting:  has had severe n/v that has been recalcitrant to many therapies, and required recent addition of olanzipine.
The patient's pleuritic chest pain largely resolved, with some residual constant chest pain.
CXR showed no additional effusion or consolidation.
#nausea:  Zofran, compazine, Ativan, scopolamine patch, Reglan attempted with poor control.
The risk of restarting Zyprexa was determined to be low, as there is little evidence of a correlation to coagulation.
2 units PRBCs were transfused and possible origins of bleeding investigated.
No signs of bleeding.
8. ranitidine HCl 150 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for heartburn.
