Admission Date:  [**2133-4-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-5-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-11-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubated [**4-9**], Extubated [**5-1**].
History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 76783**] is a 56 yo f with COPD on 2L home O2 who was brought in by ambulance when found cyanotic by daughter at home.
Had altered mental status today and was not answering the phone when her daughter called.
Per family patient had 3 week hx of uri/copd exacerbation sx and was treated with po prednisone until about 1 week ago.
Propofol bolus was given for agitation and patient's blood pressure dropped to 73/50, propofol was turned off and ivf bolus was given.
One hour later bp dropped again with no response to fluid resuscitation.
Hypercholesterolemia 3.
Carotid disease 70-80% occlusion 4.
Cervical degerative disease  Social History: SH: +tobacco- 50-60 pack years   Family History: Her mother died at age 74 from lung cancer.
Father died at age 39 from rheumatic heart disease.
Physical Exam: PE: Tm 101.4 HR 95 BP 140/79 AC 500 18 5 100% CVP 18 Gen: intubated sedated HEENT: mmm, PERRLA, jvp unable to be evaluated Lungs: expiratory wheezes bilaterally, good air movement Heart: s1 s2 no m/r/g Abd: soft nt/nd +bs Ext: 1+ pitting edema  Pertinent Results: Labs:  Microbiology: [**4-9**] sputum: MRSA.
[**4-25**] Pleural fluid: gram stain 4+ PMNs, no organisms, culture negative.
[**4-/2094**] [**Doctor Last Name **] needle biopsy: positive for malignant cells c/w poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma.
Imaging: [**4-9**] Initial CXR: IMPRESSION:  Extensive right upper lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia.
Question of possible cavitary lucency within the right upper lobe.
Serial CXRs demonstrated persistent right upper lobe consolidation and eventual opacification of nearly the entire right hemithorax due to consolidation and progressive pleural effusion.
[**4-10**] Chest CT: 1)  Large consolidation in the right upper lobe with bulky mediastinal and right hlar lymphadenopathy.
These findings together with the narrowing of the segmental right upper lobe bronchi raise the differential diagnosis of bulky reactive nodes from an infectious process vs. a post-obstructive pneumonia due to neoplastic process.
2)  Moderate dependent right pleural effusion.
[**4-20**]/ Chest CT: 1) Worsening right upper lobe bronchial obstruction with complete right upper lobe collapse.
Increase in bulky mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy.
Increase in size of right pleural effusion with new small left pleural effusion.
Findings are concerning for neoplasm such as primary lung cancer with postobstructive changes in right upper lobe.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 76783**] is a 65 yo female with a history of COPD (FEV1 0.81 liters/37% predicted) who presented with respiratory distress.
Respiratory distress: Her respiratory distress was thought to be due to a combination of pneumonia (MRSA on sputum [**4-9**], klebsiella on BAL [**4-20**]), influenza (positive influenza A [**4-11**]), her underlying COPD, and a non-small cell lung cancer and associated right sided effusion discovered during this admission.
Her right effusion which was thought to be due to her malignancy was treated first with a therapeutic thoracentecis ([**4-25**]) and eventually IP was consulted to place a pleurex catheter ([**4-29**]) for continued drainage.
Her combination of severe COPD, pneumonia, and the new diagnosis of NSCLCa with likely malignant pleural effusion made it very difficult to wean her off the ventilator.
She made it clear that she would not like to have a tracheostomy and that she would like to have some time extubated to talk with her family.
