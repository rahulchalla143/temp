Admission Date:  [**2101-12-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-12-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2042-9-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Lipitor / Levofloxacin/Dextrose 5%-Water  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**] Chief Complaint: ARF and question of multiple myeloma  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2101-12-20**]: 1.
Segmental posterior instrumentation T2-T5.
[**2101-12-27**]: Thoracentesis   History of Present Illness: 59 y/o man with PMH significant for hypercholesterolemia, HTN, and [**Hospital 22982**] transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further care for ARF and question of multiple myeloma.
Pt was in his usual state of health until mid [**7-/2101**] when he noted that he was feeling poorly with fatigue, low grade fevers of 99, and nausea.
However, the pt continued to have the above symptoms.
He has experienced increasing back pain since that time.
He also experienced severe nausea and constipation.
At that time, he rated his back pain [**11-1**].
The pt was found to have lumbar and rib fractures in addition to hypercalcemia, ARF, and anemia.
A body scan was then obtained on [**2101-12-6**] for further evaluation showing bilateral renal enlargement without evidence of excretion (nonspecific but compatible with infiltrative disease or acute glomerulonephritis), increased uptake in left ribs, increased uptake in multiple joints suggesting polyarthirits, and increased uptake in the epigastrium.
Tonight, the pt reports that he continues to have severe back pain with any movement.
He reports that he has had several stools with resolution of his constipation.
His nausea is also much better but his appetite remains poor.
Of note, the pt had noted decreased urine output at home but had attributed this to deydration secondary to his poor PO intake.
Hypercholesterolemia 2.
HTN 3.
Sleep apnea on nasal CPAP 6.
Occular migraines .
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4469**] in [**Hospital1 **]  Family History: The pt's mother has osteoporosis and lupus.
Several other family members have DM and hypercholesterolemia.
Anicteric sclera.
No lesions in the oropharynx.
No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
No rebound or gaurding.
No acute infiltrate seen.
Pleural thickening laterally on the left.
Question healing left fifth rib fracture.
There are significant blastic and lytic changes in the T3 vertebral body with loss of height suspicious for metastatic disease.
No destructive porcess seen.
However, metastatic disease involving the bone cannot be excluded.
No significant loss of height.
Minimal disc space narrowing at C5-C6.
Lateral film skull ([**12-7**])- Small lucencies seen throughout the skull questionable for metastatic disease.
No obvious fracture on the single view.
Limited images of the iliac bones show no fracture.
There is overlying stool and feces.
Single view right femur ([**12-7**])- No blastic or lytic lesions seen.
Single view left femur ([**12-7**])- No blastic of lytic lesions seen.
Single view right humerous ([**12-7**])- No blastic or lytic lesions seen.
Single view left humerous ([**12-7**])- No blastic or lytic lesions seen.
Bone scan total body ([**12-6**])- Bilateral renal enlargement without evidence of excretion.
The appearance is nonspecific but compatible with infiltrative disease or acute glomerulonephritis.
Increased uptake in the left ribs is likely posttraumatic despite the recent nondiagonstic left rib x-rays.
Increased uptake in the epigastrium is a nondiagnostic finding and is not explained on the basis of either this exam or the recent abdomen CT scan.
Renal US ([**12-5**])- Kidneys are normal without evidence of renal mass, stone, or obstruction.
Small amount of urine in the bladder.
Noncontrast CT scan of abdomen and pelvis ([**12-5**])- Moderate compression of the L2 vertebral body and mild compression of the superior endplate of L1.
No other definite abnormality is seen.
Lytic soft tissue lesion within the left T3 transverse process.
L1 insufficiency fracture of indeterminate age.
Diffuse bony demineralization.
Large bilateral pleural effusions.
Noncontrast CT of L spine ([**12-11**])- Moderate/severe L2 and mild L1 insufficiency compression fractures.
Diffuse bony demineralization.
MRI L-T spine ([**12-12**])- Pathologic compression fracture of T3, with a soft tissue lesion involving the vertebral body, pedicle and transverse process.
Mild chronic L1 compression fracture.
Edema within the L2 vertebral body, suspicious for a multiple myeloma lesion.
Possible subtle compression fracture as there is mild loss of vertebral body height.
Multilevel degenerative endplate changes noted.
Loss of height is similar in degree when compared to the CT exam of [**2101-12-11**].
Intervertebral body disc spaces are maintained.
There is mild degenerative change involving the bilateral sacroiliac joints.
Bone Marrow biopsy ([**12-13**])- DIAGNOSIS: CELLULAR BONE MARROW, EXTENSIVELY INFILTRATED BY A PLASMA CELL MYELOMA.
The bone marrow aspirate shows a predominance of plasma cells, enumerated at 76% of marrow cellularity.
Some plasma cells show atypical features.
However small marrow spicules are present and show at least 50% plasma cells.
Overall the findings are consistent with involvement by plasma cell myeloma.
Bone Marrow cytogenetics ([**12-13**])- FISH was performed with a panel of Abbot Molecular Inc./ Vysis, Inc. probes for MM and is interpreted as ABNORMAL for the CCND1-XT probe.
An abnormal hybridization pattern was observed in 24/100 nuclei, indicative of tetrasomy for the corresponding region on chromosome 11.
Surgical pathology ([**12-20**])- T3 lesion: Fibrous tissue with plasma cell infiltrate, consistent with plasmacytoma.
Fragments of bone, cartilage and fibroadipose tissue with focal areas of necrosis, consistent with fracture.
Prominent U waves could be due to left ventricular hypertrophy or possible drug/electrolyte/metabolic effect.
TTE ([**12-23**])- The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Bilateral Lower Extremity ultrasound ([**12-26**])- No evidence of bilateral lower extremity DVT.
AP and lateral CXR ([**12-27**])- Moderate-sized left-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis versus consolidation.
Portable CXR ([**12-27**])- No pneumothorax.
Near complete interval resolution left- sided pleural effusion.
Microbiology: -Stool cultures negative for C. Difficile [**12-11**] & [**12-12**] -T3 wound swab negative for microorganisms [**12-12**] -Urine cultures no growth [**12-23**] -Blood cultures no growth x2 [**12-23**] -Pleural fluid no growth, cytology pending [**12-27**] -Blood cultures x2 pending [**12-28**]   Brief Hospital Course: 59 y/o man with PMH significant for hypercholesterolemia, HTN, and [**Hospital 22982**] transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further care for ARF and question of multiple myeloma.
Multiple myeloma- was the initial concern compression fractures, ARF, anemia, hypercalcemia, and blastic and lytic lesions seen on plain imaging (not on bone scan).
However, review of the OSH records do not reveal a U-PEP or S-PEP.
The pt had also not had a bone marrow biopsy.
Here, imaging showed mass at T3, SPEP had + monoclonal spike and bone marrow bx.
confirmed myeloma (M spike in plasma and urine, 76% plasma cells in marrow, renal failure).
His calcium was slightly elevated on admission (10), but has normalized.
He has been anemic, with low retic and elevated ferritin, and was transfused 2uPRBC's [**12-13**], 2 uPRBC's [**12-23**], 2 uPRBC's [**12-24**], with 2 uFFP [**12-20**].
[**Name (NI) 10271**] Pt with severe ARF on presentation to the OSH, creatinine initially 12.6 ([**12-5**]) ---> 11.4 ([**12-7**]) ---> 6.6 ([**12-10**]) with a BUN of 145 ([**12-5**]) ---> 133 ([**12-7**]) ---> 75 ([**12-10**]).
Renal US did not show obstruction, stones, or any other clear abnormality.
T3 vertebral lesion - Seen by ortho spine - Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] - he was taken to surgery [**12-20**] for T3 corpectomy and T1-T5 fusion which was uncomplicated.
He additionally experienced chest wall muscle spasm controlled with flexeril 10mg po tid.
Additionally he had a DEXA to look for osteoporosis - has a T score -3.5, likely from his lactose intolerance.
4 Post-operative fevers - Started post op day 1 and continued for the remainder of his hospitalization, max 102.
He had no specific localizing signs or symptoms except a left sided pleural effusion which was tapped by thoracentesis [**12-27**] and found to be transudative and sterile.
Given immunocompromised state from MM (hypogammaglobulinemia) pneumonia possible (at risk for infection with incapsulated organsims), no apparent response to abx (vanco x5d, flagyl/ciprox4d, azithro/ctx x1 day).
TB potential was considered, but ppd negative, and with regard to pulmonary TB, no intrapulmonary findings on imaging and no cough.
MM induced or drug fevers were also entertained.
Antibiotics were stopped 48 hours prior to discharge per recomendation of ID and he continued to have low-grade fevers (<100.5) but continued to have no localizing signs or symptoms and was decided stable for discharge.
Anemia - Normocytic, likely [**2-24**] infiltration of marrow by myeloma cells, inappropriately low retic on admission, with elevated feritin, could be a component of chronic disease, vitamin B12 and folate WNl, iron studies c/w anemia of chronic dx.
Tranfussion goal hct>21 unless brisk bleeding present or active end-organ damage/angina, active type and cross.
Diarrhea - had some diarrhea - for 2 days initially.
9.  h/o hyperlipidemia: on fenofibrate as outpatient, held on admission [**2-24**] renal failure, now that renal failure improved consider restarting (though potentially nephrotoxic so held on discharge, recommend discussing with PCP for alternative medication with consideration for MM treatment.
OSteoporosis  - should be considered for bisphosphinates after this acute phase, after discussion with heme onc re calcium levels etc.
