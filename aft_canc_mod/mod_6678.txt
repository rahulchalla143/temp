Admission Date:  [**2177-7-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2177-7-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-12-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 88582**] Chief Complaint: Found unresponsive  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubated/Extubated  History of Present Illness: 74 yo male h/o metastatic gastric ca, found down by family at home, unresponsive.
He had a large volume of old food suctioned.
EKG showed sinus bradycardia and lateral T wave flattening/inversion, but no STEMI.
Bedside trauma u/s revealed no tamponade, no free fluid in the abdomen.
His left hepatic lobe was hypoenhancing compared with the right lobe, suggestive of occlusive left portal venous thrombosis.
He also had intestinal/adrenal findings suggestive of hypotension, though there was no free air or fluid.
Per medical records, case management call to patient's daughter [**Name (NI) 88583**] and to hospice [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 269**] [**Name (NI) **] reveals patient is newly bedbound and significantly declining, requiring 24 hour care.
Similar note from two weeks prior indicates that patient is already declining, losing weight, and taking oxycodone for worsening upper chest wall pain.
His pain is felt to be due to an expansile lytic soft tissue mass in the anterolateral third rib considered likely to be the cause of the patient's chest pain.
He also has more recently found large left upper lobe mass invading the mediastinum with satellite nodules consistent with malignancy as well as an enlarging right upper lobe nodule.
On the floor, the patient is intubated and unresponsive, without active sedation.
Past Medical History: -Gastric cancer since [**2169**]   -s/p partial gastrectomy in [**2170**] for T3b N2 disease   -s/p chemo and XRT (total 4500 cGy) in [**2170**]   -lung mets and pancreatic tail mass discovered [**2174**]   -lung nodule biopsied on [**2176-1-3**].
Pathology was consistent with non-small cell carcinoma with CK7 positive, compatible with several primary sites including pulmonary, pancreatic, and upper GI with morphologic features not typical for a lung primary   [**Hospital **] hospice since [**2-/2176**] but has remained full code -Gout -Diverticulosis -PUD -H. pylori infection -Hypertension -Anemia -Cardiac arrhythmia -Erectile dysfunction -Knee surgery  Social History: The patient began smoking at age 19 and averaged two packs per day subsequently.
Family History: No family history of malignancy.
Sclera anicteric, ETT in place, dry MM, pupils 2-3 mm bilaterally, without response to light Neck: head rotated to the right, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: course sounds at bases bilaterally (L>R), no wheeze CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: foley in place Neuro: Pt unresponsive as above.
No spontaneous movement of extremities, and no movement to verbal command or nail bed or sternal pressure.
Pupils are fixed at 2-3 mm bilaterally, unresponsive to light.
No hemorrhage or other acute intracranial process.
Global parenchymal volume loss and white matter changes compatible with sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemia.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.
The aorta is atherosclerotic, and there is extensive mural thrombus in the descending thoracic aorta.
Associated mediastinal and left hilar adenopathy and moderate left pleural effusion are also identified 3.
Moderately severe emphysema.
No evidence of superimposed pneumonia or aspiration.
Heterogeneous perfusion of the liver, likely reflecting presence of portal venous thrombus, which is partially occlusive in the main portal vein and occlusive within the left portal venous system.
Multiple hepatic hypodensities, concerning for metastases.
Left lateral third rib lytic lesion, compatible with metastasis.
Primary process thought to be severe hypoglycemia, as pt had two readings of BS <10 prior to ICU admission.
Ruled out other diagnoses as follows: No acute intracerebral process on head CT. CT chest/abdomen revealed only disseminated metastasis involving the L perihilar region and liver.
Pt may have had element of altered mental status from infection (aspiration pneumonia vs intrabdominal process), but WBC count was only minimally elevated and he was afebrile, asymptomatic, and responsive on IV fluids with dextrose.
Pt eating at home per report, but given presentation and severe cachexia it appeas that he is unable to intake/absorb sufficient nutrition to maintain his body's metabolic needs.
In addition, low muscle glyogen stores and a portal venous thrombus noted on CT likely further impair pt's ability to maintain BS via gluconeogenesis and glycogen mobilization.
Pt was asymptomatic & mentating appropriately even with fingersticks below 50, so severe hypoglycemia thought to be chronic.
Has known pulmonary involvement from malignancy, but does not require home oxygen.
No signs of symptoms of abdominal pain, though patient globally unresponsive.
LFT abnormalities are as noted in HPI without prior labs available for comparison.
Did not start anticoagulation given general instability, low hematocrit, possible low grade DIC on admission labs.
# Renal insufficiency: Recent baseline renal function unknown.
# Metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma: CT torso now with likely involvement of liver, lung, pancreas, and chest wall.
No therapeutic options, no intervention pursued.
Updated family on evening of admission, and held family meeting prior to floor transfer.
On this dose, pain noted to be well controlled per patient and family.
Medications on Admission: -Nexium 40mg daily -Oxycodone 5mg q4-6h prn pain -Naproxen   Discharge Medications: 1.
2. oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain .
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: sherrillhouse  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis : Hypoglycemia  Secondary Diagnosis : Gastric cancer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
