LINE PLACEM In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is now a right jugular sheath in place without evidence of pneumothorax.
Small amounts of blood tracking around the liver, both paracolic gutters, and into the pelvis.
[**2140-8-20**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) In comparison with the study of [**8-13**], there is continued hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.
There is associated decrease in markings at the apices with coarse interstitial markings in the lower lung zones.
The possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
Micro: [**2140-8-19**] Urine culture, final: negative [**2140-8-20**] MRSA screen x 2, final: negative   Brief Hospital Course: 81M with CAD s/p MI, severe COPD (home oxygen 2.5 L), HTN, HL, MDS (on cycle 2 Vidaza), and bladder cancer (s/p TURBT and BCG treatment in [**2135**] was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **] [**2140-8-19**] with retroperitoneal bleed and is now s/p coil embolizatoin of left hypogastric artery and IVC filter placement.
# Retroperitoneal bleed: Atraumatic bleed in the setting of anticoagulation for provoked DVT/PE with INR in therapeutic range of 2.3 at presentation.
Initially presented to [**Location (un) 620**] where CT showed active extravasation on CTA abd/pelvis.
Had CT scan at 5am on [**8-20**] which showed expansion with decompression of peritoneal cavity and his hypogastric artery was coil embolized, achieving hemostasis.
The bleeding was not related to his iliac aneurysm.
Peripheral access was obtained in the CV ICU and his cortis was pulled.
# PE: Diagnosed [**2140-8-13**] by CTA revealing subsegmental right lower lobe pulmonary embolus.
Was anticoagulated with INR 2.3 on admission, and is now s/p reversal given RP bleed coil of hypogastric artery.
No evidence of bleeding and stable hematocrits.
# Elevated Bicarb: Bicarb peaked at 43.
Likely multifactorial due to COPD with chronic renal compensation and retention of bicarb.
Also likely component of contraction alkalosis secondary to aggressive diuresis.
# LE edema: Patient with continued marked lower extremity edema likely from iatrogenic volume overload due to transfusion of 10U pRBCs.
He should continue to have his legs elevated at night and throughout the day when recumbent in bed.
# COPD: Patient has a history severe COPD with FEV1 of approximately 0.7 on 2.5L NC at home.
His home medications were continued and there was no e/o COPD flare on this admission.
# Ischemic Colitis: Diagnosed [**Hospital1 **] CT [**8-4**], involving descending/sigmoid colon area.
Initially presumed infectious s/p 10 day course cipro/flagyll but in context of atherosclerotic disease and large volume bleed, ischemic seemed more likely.
# Liver and renal hypodensities: seen on CT scan last [**Hospital1 **] admission likely cysts vs hemangiomas.
- outpatient MRI/renal US to further evaluate  # CAD s/p MI: His home Atorvastatin and Diltiazem were continued throughout his course.
# Transitional issues: - Patient will need IV heparin bridge to Coumadin (INR goal [**1-15**] for 6 months) - Will need daily INR checks until therapeutic - Patient scheduled for follow up with Vascular Surgery (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] - Please ensure the patient follows up for interval IVC filter removal.
- Pt will need outpatient MRI/renal US to evaluate liver and renal hypodensities seen on CT  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
Polyethylene Glycol 17 g PO DAILY:PRN constipation   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: - Left Retroperitoneal Hematoma / expanding - Anemia requiring transfusion - Pulmonary emobolism / recent - Left Iliac Artery Aneurysm  Secondary diagnoses: Severe COPD on home O2, coronary artery disease status post MI, hyperlipidemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and bladder cancer status post TURBT   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were given multiple blood transfusions.
You required an endovascular procedure to stop the bleeding as well as to prevent a future blood clot in your lungs.
Due to the recent blood clots in your leg and lungs, you were restarted on blood thinners (Heparin and Coumadin) and you should continue taking Coumadin as prescribed following discharge.
You make take Tylenol or prescribed pain medications for any post procedure pain or discomfort  WHAT TO EXPECT: It is normal to have slight swelling of the legs: ??????
Elevate your leg above the level of your heart with pillows every 2-3 hours throughout the day and night ??????
Avoid prolonged periods of standing or sitting without your legs elevated ??????
Your incision may be left uncovered, unless you have small amounts of drainage from the wound, then place a dry dressing or band aid over the area ??????
Numbness, coldness or pain in lower extremities ??????
New or increased drainage from incision or white, yellow or green drainage from incisions ??????
Bleeding from groin puncture site  SUDDEN, SEVERE BLEEDING OR SWELLING (Groin puncture site) ??????
