# NSTEMI: Patient has a history of CABG, and had very elevated cardiac enzymes on admission (Trop T 65.48, CKMB 72.1).
TTE during this admission shows acute changes, EF from 55-60% on [**7-26**] to 25-30%, severely depressed LV systolic function, severe LV global HK in inf, post, lat walls, depressed RV systolic function, 3+MR, 2+TR.
CXR shows unchanged pleural effusions and atelectasis.
He was not started on a statin since he was admitted with acute ischemic hepatitis, and LFTs were still decreasing to normal levels.
# AFIB with rapid ventricular rate: He was in AFIB with rapid ventricular rate, with a pacer for sick sinus/tachy-brady, HR 100-140s, controlled on Metoprolol and Diltiazem.
He was not anticoagulated since he has head and neck cancer and had pancytopenia from chemo and radiation.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely associated with bilateral pleural effusions, cardiac stunning, and COPD.
Patient was diuresed here with lasix gtt, 5-10 mg per hour for pleural effusions, but he was not total body fluid overloaded.
Patient has COPD and was placed on albuterol inhalers, spiriva, and advair during admission to be continued.
**As a note, the patient's lasix regimen was added during this admission, and should be titrated up as appropriate to diurese for his bilateral pleural effusions.
# Acute oliguric renal failure: Patient's acute renal failure was prerenal in etiology and associated with a depressed EF and/or post-ischemic ATN, not responsive to fluid boluses.
Renal US showed atrophic L kidney unchanged since [**7-14**], no stone, no hydro, no mass.
Ulytes consistent with prerenal etiology.
Renal failure gradually resolved over admission.
# Acute ischemic hepatitis: Patient had LFTs in the thousands, associated with hepatic congestion from NSTEMI.
He showed no signs of cholestasis or obstruction.
# Febrile neutropenia/pancytopenia/L piriform sinus SCC: Patient has head and neck cancer, s/p carboplatin/taxol and XRT, last XRT and chemo [**10-7**].
He was neutropenic for only the first day of admission, and was afebrile throughout admission.
He completed a Ceftazidime/Vanco for a 7 day course for neutropenia and coverage in case of pneumonia.
He was on neupogen until he was no longer neutropenic.
# Hypertension: Was unremarkable throughout admission, controlled on Metoprolol and Diltiazem.
# Diabetes mellitus: He was maintained on Lantus 16 qhs and sliding scale.
Ondansetron 4 mg IV Q8H:PRN   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: NSTEMI Secondary diagnosis: Head and neck cancer, AFIB, COPD, Trach, PEG   Discharge Condition: VSS, on trach mask, comfortable and asymptomatic.
Return to the ER if you experience increasing shortness of breath, difficulty of breathing, or chest pain.
