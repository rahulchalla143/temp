He was admitted to OSH [**2116-5-29**] for treatment of polysubstance abuse who developed RUQ pain in setting of elevated LFT's.
Cytology of brushings revealed highly atypical glandular cells suspicious for adenocarcinoma.
Original plan was for a whipple procedure but pt then had CTA abdomen which showed some small liver lesions and lung nodules, likely metastatic, and so now no longer a surgical candidate.
There was also a plan for u/s guided liver Bx, and pt had liver u/s showing several tiny right lobe nodules consistent with metastatic disease, but unable to safely localize for biopsy.
), is having epigastric abdominal pain, and increased twitching of his arms and legs that has only started in the past couple days.

echo  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Ill-defined hypodense mass in the pancreatic head and uncinate process, that is difficult to discretely measure but a rough estimate would be 2.8 cm.
There is associated marked porta hepatis, retroperitoneal, and mesenteric lymphadenopathy as well as numerous hypodense liver lesions, pulmonary nodules, and pleural-based nodules.
Constellation of findings are highly suspicious for pancreatic adenocarcinoma with metastatic disease.
Note that there is no evidence of vascular involvement from the primary mass.
Pancreatic head calcifications consistent with chronic pancreatitis as well as marked atrophy of the pancreatic body and tail which are related to chronic pancreatitis or chronic obstruction from the mass.
Small left greater than right pleural effusions.
RUQ US  CONCLUSION: Several tiny right lobe nodules consistent with metastatic disease, but unable to be successfully localized for safe ultrasound-guided biopsy.
CXR  FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing interstitial opacities in both lungs have increased in extent.
No larger pleural effusions are visible.
Mild cardiomegaly.
Brief Hospital Course: 60yoM with h/o DM2, CHF?, bipolar d/o, substance abuse and homeless; with newly diagnosed metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Pt was admitted from Surgery to OMED where he was admitted for transaminitis and RUQ pain and found to have metastatic pancreatic cancer, not candidate for Whipple.
He developed obtundation and hypoxia and spent some time in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Likely due to too much pain medication, however aspiration also considered and pt covered broadly with Vanc/Zosyn.
Given clinical picture and goals of care being comfort, pt was called out to floor satting in the 80-90's on NRB, however when he took off the mask, noted to quickly desaturate to 60-70's, even as low as 30% noted, and get SOB.
CXR showing diffuse interstitial infiltrates in all lung fields.
