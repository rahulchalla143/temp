He had a new LBBB on EKG but cardiac enzymes were negative and so cardiology thought LBBB was [**1-11**] COPD exacerbation and PNA.
ABx regimen changed to include Vancomycin because of concern for necrotizing PNA caused by kleb or staph.
EKG revealed t-wave inversions in III and aVF, but again cardiac enzymes continued to be negative.

Bronchiectasis and Granulomatous Lung Mass: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 217**], M.D.
Low Testosterone on adrogel 9.
His only exposure history is that related to radiation that he had for his squamous cell and seminoma.
Family History: Father died of colon cancer at the age of 80.
Mother died of CVA at the age of 94.
Physical Exam: General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress, using accessory muscles to breath HEENT: Sclera anicteric, PERRL, MMdry, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVD flat, no LAD Lungs: Diffuse rhonchi throughout R>L, crackles and wheezes at the left base CV: RRR, loud S1, nl S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: +BS, soft, non-tender, distended, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: + foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: A&Ox3, CN 2-12 intact  Discharge PE: ****** VS******* GEN: Well nourished male, laying in bed, pleasant and in good humor.
On auscultation he has diffuse inspiratory stridor, coarse rhonchi throughout R>L and end expiratory wheezes R>L.
There is a large radiation scar over R upper back.
Abd: BS+, soft, NT, ND, no rebound/guarding, no HSM, no [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign Extremities: wwp, no edema.
There is no evident pneumothorax.
Left lower lobe opacities consistent with pneumonia are unchanged.
Right lower lobe opacity has worsened, most likely due to worsening large area of atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 yo M with COPD and stage 1 Lung Ca who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with cough and dyspnea at rest.
He had a new LBBB on EKG but cardiac enzymes were negative and so cardiology thought LBBB was [**1-11**] COPD exacerbation and PNA.
He received a BAL which revelaed no organisms but was significant for blood.
ABx regimen changed to include Vancomycin because of concern for necrotizing PNA caused by kleb or staph.
EKG revealed t-wave inversions in III and aVF, but again cardiac enzymes continued to be negative.
On the floor he was weaned off oxygen and continuous O2 monitoring until he was mid 90s on 1L with only occasional desat with exertion.
# Respiratory failure/Hypoxia: Came to the floor S/P intubation for increasing respiratory distress and fatigue while on Bipap.
Respiratory failure was likely [**1-11**] CAP given left shift, infiltrate seen on CXR and increasing respiratory distress.
Necrotizing PNA caused by kleb or staph could not be r/o in light of bloody BAL.
Pseudomonas less likely without bronchiectasis and no prior history of resistant organisms or recent hospitalizations.
A/A nebs for COPD with relief of wheezes.
He was afebrile during admission, without a leukocytosis and without s/s of PNA.
Day before discharge he had worsening wheezes and occasional desats.
new opacities in mid lung, he was afebrile, there was no change in cough character and recently completed abx -- therefore, repeat abx course deferred.
Patient knows to call with any pulmonary changes  #Episode of Afib: associated  w/ TWI in III and AVF and a RBBB.
Pt has h/o Aflutter and RBBB is seen on EKG from [**2197-5-15**].
He converted into A. Flutter but had some hypotensin and bradycardia.
#Anemia: HCT from 42 on admission to 35 and then to 29. there was no clear source of bleeding, guaic negative, but he was having some bloody secretions previously (BAL)and a slow pulmonary bleed might be contributing.
# Acute kidney injury: Seems to be resolved in ICU, likely pre-renal in setting of infection.
Heparin was not started because of dropping H/H and history of bloody secretions.
Transitional Issues: - ?Opacity in left mid lung on CXR after abx course without clinical signs of infection:If he does show new signs of PNA or clinical status changes he should be covered with Vanc/Cefepime for HAP/pseudomonas.
- Pt asked to follow up with cardiology for ass titrating his BP/nodal blocking meds - Pt to f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] r.e decreasing Ritalin to 40 from 55 and history of mental status changes when off of Ritalin.
