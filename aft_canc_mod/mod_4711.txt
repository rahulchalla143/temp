Patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital in late [**Month (only) **] with right knee septic arthritis following a right total knee replacement, cultures grew Group B Strep.
Per report, the patient had bilateral DVTs on [**2184-12-15**], noted again on LENIs from [**2185-1-1**].
Per report, she developed respiratory distress on [**2185-1-1**], with hypoxia and wheezing.
No aspiration event was witnessed.
There was a question of excess sedation.
IV fluids were given for hypotension and tachycardia.
She had a second episode of respiratory distress, and was transferred to the ICU for further management.
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed on [**2185-1-4**] for hemodynamic monitoring in the setting of possible cardiogenic shock.
She also received pulse dose methylprednisolone for possible COPD exacerbation.
Over past few days, vent wean has been complicated by low minute ventilation and airway secretions.
Today, patient had episode of hemoptysis, with 50-100 cc of bright red blood suctioned through ET tube.
Bronch showed lesions in left main stem bronch near second carina, one suspicious for an eroding broncholith.
A bleeding lesion was injected with epinephrine and iced saline, with hemostasis.
She complained of pain in her right knee, and denied any other pain.

RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2185-1-10**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
UCX- yeast BCX- negative x2   Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 68990**] is a 78 yo female with a PMH significant for CAD s/p PCI, HTN, HLD, COPD, recent right knee replacement complicated by septic joint, bilateral DVT s/p IVC filter transferred from OSH for management of hemoptysis and respiratory failure.
# Hemoptysis- submassive:  In the ICU, bronch showed two areas of ulceration of unclear etiology and a possible polypoid lesion.
No diagnostic or therapeutic intervention performed by IP.
No further hemoptysis.
Upon transfer to the floor, discussion about repeat bronchoscopy to r/o any oozing lesions prior to starting anticoagulation (for DVT's per below).
Went to IP procedure lab, but IP decided she was too high risk given recent cardiac pathology (see below).
Given her stable HCT and no further hemoptysis since transfer from OSH, suggested starting systemic anticoagulation with a heparin gtt and following up with rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia if repeat bleeding were to occur.
Started hepar gtt without issue, HCT was stable.
No further interventions were needed.
# Hypotension/Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: In the ICU her hypotension was thought to be secondary to acute systolic heart failure secondary to her NSTEMI and worsening systolic function.
She had no evidence of distributive shock.
Dobutamine was weaned upon arrival without difficulty.
TTE showed worsening systolic function with new EF of 25-30% (from baseline of 40%).
Bilateral lower extremity was present throughout duration of stay thought to be due to bilateral DVT's.
Patient claims to have her own cardiologist, but also given the number of the [**Hospital1 18**] cardiology clinic if she would like to transition her care to the [**Hospital1 18**] system.
# Respiratory failure:  Likely a component of pulmonary edema from acute systolic heart failure given her improvement with diuresis.
She had no return of SOB while on the general medical floors.
No further thoracic imaging was done to look for PE as patient was to receive systemic anticoagulation regardless for B/L DVT's.
# NSTEMI: Patient was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes with TnTs peaking at 0.55.
No EKG changes.
Cardiology was consulted, but anticoagulation (plavix and heparin gtt) was held due to hemoptysis due to risk of bleeding.
She had a TTE which showed an overall left ventricular systolic function which was moderately to severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %) with infeior, lateral, anterior and apical hypokinesis to akinesis (which is worse then her baseline EF of 40%).
No ekg/telemetry changes were observed.
Had pharmacologic stress test with persantine followed by MIBI.
Stress was negative for EKG changes/anginal symptoms, and MIBI showed irreversible defect in the PAD/LCx distribution.
After acute hemorrhaging was ruled out (per above) was started on heparin gtt.
HCT stable on heparin gtt and tranisitioned to enoxaparin 90 mg [**Hospital1 **] for at least 3 months of treatment (started anticoagulation [**2185-1-11**]) given provoked development of DVTs in the setting of orthopedic surgery and lack of mobility.
Will need follow up in 3 months with f/u lower extremity ultrasounds to assess for dissolution of blood clots.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: JML Center  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Septic Arthritis Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Hemoptysis Bilateral Lower Extremity Deep Vein Thromboses  Secondary: Chronic obstrucitve pulmonary disease Hypertension Coronary artery disease with stenting of left anterior descending artery in [**2174**] Internal carotid stenosis status post coronary artery dissection Type II Diabetes Mellitus Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Osteoarthritis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
At the previous hospital, you experience a heart attack known as a "Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction" or "NSTEMI" for short.
It is a heart attack which occurs without changes seen on an EKG, but is detected by blood tests which tell your medical team that your heart muscle has been affected.
Thus, you should continue to take your cardiac medication as prescribed to decrease the risk of having another cardiac event in the future.
This was most likely thought to be due to airway irritation from suctioning while you were intubated.
This is a complication that can occur in patients who experience a knee replacement, which you had.
Please follow up with your primary care doctor if you have returning symptoms of reflux including heart burn/sour taste in the morning.
Given your episodes of hemoptysis (coughing up blood), you will need to follow up with interventional pulmonology for a repeat bronchoscopy to image your airway.
