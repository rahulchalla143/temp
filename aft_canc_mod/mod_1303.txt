Admission Date:  [**2142-12-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-12-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2101-3-31**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine / Oxygen  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**] Chief Complaint: Skin lesions and SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 41-year-old man with Hodgkin's Disease s/p autologous hematopoetic stem cell transplant (HSCT) [**2-11**] and two prior episodes of varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection (dermatomal vs. disseminated [**9-12**]; disseminated [**11-11**]) who noted the onset new lesions along his anterior right torso at 1600 yesterday.
They are painful and slightly pruritic, and there is some tingling associated with them as well.
Associated with the eruption of these lesions, he also had shooting, burning pains along the right side of his torso.
He was also given two liters of normal saline and hydromorphone 4 mg IV for pain control.
While there, the patient's wife noted the evolution of similar, erythematous, maculopapular lesions along the patient's right nasolabial fold; he also manifested a few lesions on the left side of his torso as well.
A fluorscein examination was performed in the ED; there was no uptake or dendritic lesions bilaterally.
The patient denies antecedent fever or malaise.
He denies ocular, forehead, or scalp pain or hypesthesia.
He denies changes in vision, blurred vision, trouble closing either eye, or excess or insufficient lacrimation.
He denies ear pain, difficulty hearing, or changes in hearing (tinnitus, hyperacusis).
He denies facial weakness, difficulty speaking, or change in ability to taste.
He denies sense of imbalance or dysequilibrium.
Of note, 11 days prior to admission, the patient phoned the oncology clinic and reported a hacking cough productive of clear/yellow sputum and associated dyspnea.
He had a mild sore throat but had no fevers, coryza, myalgias, or arthralgias at the time.
Stage 1B Hodgkin's Disease (nodular sclerosis type) diagnosed in [**2136**] (large anterior mediastinal mass).
Presumed community-acquired pneumonia [**8-12**] 5.
Depression 7.
Chronic lower extremity pain 10.
He has no pets.
His mother has hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and a history of rheumatic heart disease.
Mild maxillary sinus tenderness.
No conjunctival hyperemia or lid droop; conjunctivae clear.
No lesions in the auditory canal.
Dry oral mucosae.
No pharyngeal, buccal, or sublingual lesions.
Nodes: No cervical adenopathy.
No [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign or hepatosplenomegaly.
Skin: Numerous (20-30) erythematous, maculopapular, non-blanching, slightly tender rounded lesions over the right side of the torso from the nipple line to the waist line; the lesions measure 5-10 mm in diameter.
There are a handful of similar lesions on the left side of the torso, and there are patches of smaller, coalesced lesions over both nasolabial folds.
There are no lower extremity or genital lesions.
There are some erythematous lesions over the upper back that appear more chronic and are dissimilar in appearance; there are no other lesions over the back.
CT Chest: New diffuse bilateral ground glass opacification with associated reticulation, highly concerning for an acute infectious process, but the absence of nodules is atypical for varicella pneumonia.
Non-infectious etiologies including pulmonary hemorrhage, acute intersititial pneumonia, hydrostatic edema, and drug reaction are also possible in the appropriate clinical setting.

Acid Fast Culture: Pending Amplified MTB direct test: Negative, Culture pending  Brief Hospital Course: Impression: 41-year-old man with Hodgkin's Disease status-post autologous HSCT [**2-11**] now with recurrent disseminated Varicella Zoster infection.
Zoster: Lesions on trunk and face were atypical for disseminated cutaneous disease.
His pain was controlled with Dilaudid PCA at first, then he developed confusion.
Ultimately, he was placed on a lidocaine patch, fentanyl patch, Lyrica [**Hospital1 **], as well as Dilaudid PO prn for control.
Acute renal failure: Likely secondary to acyclovir.
Hypoxia/Pneumonia:  While his CXR on admission was unchanged from one a few months ago, he had a recent productive cough, and an [**11-16**] PET scan showed new, mild FDG uptake associated with new air-space disease in the left lung base; this was associated with a mostly ground-glass appearance with a more solid component on an accompanying chest CT.
He was subsequently treated empirically with ten days of azithromycin for a productive cough (last dose was on the day of admission).
CXR showed new RUL infiltrate.
On [**12-11**] AM, got CT chest which showed new diffuse bilateral ground glass opacification with associated reticulation.
The features are most concerning for an infectious process, but the absence of nodules was atypical for varicella pneumonia.
Broncheoalveolar lavage and induced sputum results were essentially negative for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3019**], but a concentrated smear for AFB was positive on [**12-11**], and he was placed in a negative pressure room (but the AFB was not treated).
Hodgkin's Disease: No evidence of recurrent FDG-avid disease on [**11-16**] PET scan.
Mild FDG uptake associated with a portacaval lymph node is unchanged.
Per wife, has a history of worsening depression/anxiety.
Altered Mental Status: While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with low oxygen saturations, he developed an altered mental status, marked by hallucinations and irrational thought processes.
Hyponatremia/SIADH - likely secondary to a pulmonary process vs. medication.
