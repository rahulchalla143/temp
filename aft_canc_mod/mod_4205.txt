RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2116-8-28**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
Both upper lungs are aerated with no new areas of opacities.
The persisting bilateral lower lobe opacities may represent atelectasis/pneumonic consolidation secondary to aspiration.
CCT: [**2116-8-24**]: No evidence of main, lobar or segmental pulmonary embolism.
Complete occlusion of the left lower lobe bronchus from secretions with atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
Low-density areas are within the atelectatic left lower lobe suggestive of a pneumonic consolidation.
Moderate left pleural effusion.
Dilated and fluid filled neoesophageus causing compressive atelectasis of the adjacent lung.
Possibility of distal obstruction is suspected.
Mild pneumomediastinum, minimal right sided pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema along the right chest wall which are likely post-procedure related.
Esophagus [**2116-8-25**]: No evidence of leak.
However, delay in gastric emptying of barium from the stomach into the duodenum with retention of barium within the distal stomach.
Buttressing of intrathoracic anastomosis with pericardial fat.

The Chest film revealed a Dilated esophagus likely secondary to pylorus spasm.
Bedside bronchoscopy with suction of multiple mucus plugs.
Sputum culture was positive for ENTEROBACTER AEROGENES pan-sensitive.
