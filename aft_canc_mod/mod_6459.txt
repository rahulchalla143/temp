On a screening CT scan from [**2137-9-4**], five years from his initial diagnosis, he was found to have two small arterial enhancing foci within the liver concerning for hepatocellular carcinoma.
On [**2137-12-18**], he underwent a CT-guided biopsy confirming the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and radiofrequency ablation of one of these lesions.
His most recent CT scan from on [**2139-6-3**] reveals cirrhosis and treated HCC with no new lesions.
Also noted are chronic venous thrombosis and portal hypertension.
The patient reports no priorabdominal surgeries.
He has occasional discomfort around the "liver area" and his right flank that is transient and brief.
He has been feeling well recently, denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or any other GI complaints.
He states he has intermittent abdominal pain and points to his right back area as the source of pain.
He denies chest pain, shortness of breath, edema.
3 Hepatoma lesions: TACE x2 [**2138-2-13**] and RFA x1 hepatoma lesion 4.
Esophageal varices with history of hemorrhage 5.
Portal hypertension 6.
Thrombocytopenia, presumably secondary to splenic sequestration.
Splenic mesenteric vein thrombosis .
No oral lesions.
LYMPH NODES:  No cervical, supraclavicular, occipital, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Abd: + BS, soft, non-tender, non-distended, no splenomegaly appreciated, no scars noted, no palpable hepatomegaly, palpable ascites or other masses.
Extr: warm and well perfused, no peripheral edema, clubbing, or cyanosis.
No new lesions.
Chronic venous thrombosis and portal hypertension.
Hyperechoic lesion seen in segment V of the liver, the appearance of which is suggestive of a hemangioma.
No biliary dilatation and no collections identified.
The left hepatic artery is patent but difficult to visualize due to technical factors.
Scant trace fluid in the perihepatic spce and small right pleural effusion.
There is no evidence of intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Mild periportal edema is noted.
Peripheral liver hypodesnities that may be post surgical trauma or infarcts.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1256**] was admitted to the Transplant Surgery service and underwent an orthotopic deceased donor liver transplant (piggyback), portal vein to portal vein anastomosis, infrarenal conduit from the aorta to the hepatic artery at the confluence of the common hepatic artery and gastroduodenal artery using donor iliac artery graft, common bile duct to common bile duct anastomosis with no T-tube.
For low plateletes he was transfused 2 further platelets, and for a borderline low hct he was transfused one additional unit PRBCs.
The rest of his hospital stay is summarized below by system:  Neuro: pain was never a prominent complaint and was well controlled on narcotics with a relatively low pain med requirement.
After the initial peri- and post-operative period, he required no further transfusions.
GI: Liver duplex on [**9-7**] some abnormal arterial waveforms and so the liver duplex was repeated on POD 2, which showed improvement.
Although he initially had elevated transaminases, this improved with time and his bilirubin and synthetic function improved until discharge.
He was sent home with an 8 day supply of PO lasix to help get him get rid of his last excess fluid.
