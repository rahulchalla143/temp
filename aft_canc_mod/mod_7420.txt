Admission Date:  [**2141-3-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2141-4-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2057-1-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9160**] Chief Complaint: BRBPR  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: - central venous line placement - mesenteric angiography - sigmoidoscopy with clip placement   History of Present Illness: 84 yo M with a history of extensive diverticulosis of the colon (particularly the sigmoid), Atrial Fibrillation on ASA/plavix, and several prior episodes of diverticular bleeding.
He presented to his gastroenterologist's office this morning after having several loose stool and frank blood per rectum x 3.
At that time, he complained of mild dizziness but was noted to look well.
He was noted to have BRBPR on rectal exam, but no active bleeding.
He is not weak or short of breath.
He has not re-bled since the episode this morning and has had no further loose bowel movements.
Of note, he was seen by his PCP & ortho the week preceding for what seems to have been a hemarthrosis judging by a fluid Hct of 29, but the improvement in his knee pain seems a bit more brisk than I would have expected for that condition--states his knee pain is now minimal.
Past Medical History: - Atrial Fibrillation, CHADS2 score = 2, on plavix/ASA instead of coumadin because of recurrent GI bleeding.
- several prior admissions for diverticular bleeding, has only ever required one transfusion.
- Hypertension.
- Lumbar spinal stenosis.
- Hypothyroidism.
- Hearing loss.
- Hypercholesterolemia.
- Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
- Caretaker stress (spouse with dementia).
- Bilateral herniorrhaphies.
- Tonsillectomy.
- Cataract surgery.
- Thyroid cyst removal.
Family History: Notable for heart disease in his father and brother.
Physical Exam: 97.9, 138/91, 93, 20, 97ra General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress.

Focus of active extravasation of blood in the sigmoid colon consistent with ongoing GI bleeding (likely related to diverticulosis).
An additional area of high density near the splenic flexure is felt likely to represent inspissated material within a diverticulum with additional focus of extravasation felt less likely.
5-mm hypodensity in the pancreatic tail, correlating to a cyst or dilated side branch on prior MR, appears stable.
Bilateral renal cysts, including a right upper pole cyst with mild complexity but no specifically worrisome features, unchanged.
Bilateral nonobstructing renal stones.
Diffuse colonic diverticulosis.
Selective inferior mesenteric artery DSA angiogram in multiple non-orthogonal projections demonstrated no active arterial bleeding in the descending or the sigmoid colon.
Multiple supraselective DSA injections of the first and second order branches of the inferior mesenteric artery supplying the area of interest demonstrated no active extravasation.
Brief Hospital Course: 84yo M with AFIB on ASA/plavix and extensive diverticulosis presented with recurrent diverticular bleeding which appeared active on CTA, but could not be isolated on angiography.
Subsequently went for sigmoidoscopy with clipping of three oozing diverticuli which achieved hemostasis.
# Diverticular Bleeding / Acute Blood Loss Anemia: Ultimately required transfusion of 4 U pRBC and transfer to the medical ICU.
Had resolution of GI bleeding after diverticuli were clipped.
# Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: Despite resolution of GI bleeding, he was noted to have HR up to 140-160s only with exertion that returned to 70-90 range upon rest.
Holding ASA and Plavix, which he takes for stroke prophylaxis as he has previously had diverticular bleeding on Coumadin.
- Titrate Metoprolol as needed based on HR and symptoms (currently asymptomatic).
Disp:*45 Tablet Extended Release 24 hr(s)* Refills:*0* 7. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: ACUTE DIVERTICULAR BLEED ACUTE BLOOD LOSS ANEMIA ATRIAL FIBRILLATION HYPERTENSION BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERTROPHY   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted with a serious diverticular bleed which required several transfusions and transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
The bleeding could not be stopped by interventional radiologists, but eventually ceased after severl clips were placed in your sigmoid colon.
While you were here, you did not receive lisinopril or amlodipine.
