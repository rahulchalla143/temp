Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD Bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 63 year old male with a history of prostate cancer with bony metastases, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, [**First Name3 (LF) 18048**] s/p renal transplant, lung cancer s/p resection and h/o prior GIB (per patient) who presented to the ED on [**2129-5-29**] after having large volume brown, guaiac positive emesis at his [**Hospital1 1501**] the morning of presentation.
He denied any hemetemesis, hematochezia, or melena although he cannot recall what color his stool is.
The patient denied any abdominal pain, lightheadedness or dizziness.
He did admit to a cough with brownish sputum for the "past hour" prior to admission but denied any shortness of breath or chest pain.
He denied any orthopnea or back pain.
He was found to have a Hct of 24.8 with a WBC of 7.7 and no bands.
The patient was found to be guaiac positive rectally.
His CXR showed a bibasilar opacities concerning for pneumonia.
The patient was started on decadron 6 mg IV for presumed sepsis, CTX/flagyl/vanco which was switched to zosyn/vanco and bibasilar pneumonia with a lactate of 3.2.
Past Medical History: -Prostate carcinoma with lumbar metastases -Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on coumadin -Lung cancer s/p RUL resection x2 and LLL biopsy -Polycystic kidney disease s/p right renal cadaveric transplant [**2112**] -liver cysts (discovered on CT in [**2127**]) -peripheral neuropathy -H/O recurrent urosepsis, had been on prophylactic gatifloxacin for approximately 2 years (?stopped one year PTA) -HTN -hyperlipidemia -s/p Cholecystectomy -H/O diverticulitis with pericolic abscess and partial colectomy in [**2117**] -Peripheral neuropathy leading to bilateral 1st toe amputations -H/o TIAs -H/o GIB per patient -h/o pancreatitis -multiple episodes of MRSA osteomyelitis leading to bilateral great toe amputations and s/p right hip arthroplasty for osteomyelitis  Social History: The patient is a former smoker 1 ppd x 20 years and quit in [**2112**].
Family History: Son with [**Name2 (NI) 18048**] Divorced   Physical Exam: Tc = 99.0  P=103  BP=113/64 RR=16 96% on RA3 liters O2 Gen - NAD, AOX2 ( thinks year is [**2089**] but is able to name the president of the U.S) Heart - Irregular rate and rhythm, no M/R/G Lungs - Bibasilar decreased breath sounds, no wheezes, rhales, rhonchi Abdomen - Right flank palpable kidney, no abdominal tenderness/distention, positive splenomegaly (nontender), mild ecchymoses on skin Ext - SCD bilaterally, 1st toes bilaterally amputated, +1 d. pedis bilaterally Skin: scattered ecchymoses Neurologic: CN II-XII intact Sensation diminished to light touch over BLE to mid-tibial region.
Motor: 3-5Hz, low amplitude tremor at rest.
Pertinent Results: CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2129-5-29**] 5:50 AM, on admission  IMPRESSION: Questionable opacity in the right lower lobe versus patient positioning.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2129-5-29**] 8:06 AM IMPRESSION: 1) Right lower lobe pneumonia, and subtle opacity in the left lower lobe, which may represent early infiltrate versus atelectasis.
2) Right-sided volume loss of unknown etiology.
His hypotension was felt to be secondary to hypovolemia and his blood pressure responded to IVF resuscitation.
The patient presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate to the 140-160s which responded well to IVF to the 100s.
It was felt that his rapid rate was either precipitated by his hypotension or the cause of it.
His coumadin is currently being held and he was given 10 mg SC of vitamin K in the ED.
He was found to have a bibasilar pneumonia and was started on on Zosyn and Vancomycin (1st dose 5-15).
UGIB/Hematemesis: The pts hematocrit was cycled q12 hours and was stable in the 27-29 range, requiring no further transfusions.
It revealed an arteriovenous malformation in the gastric antrum which was cauterized.
He did have an episode of BRBPR and a small blood clot in his stool on hospital day 4.
Atrial fibrillation:  The patient was placed on digoxin 0.125 mg for rate control as cardizem and lopressor held secondary to hypotension on admission.
CAD/myocardial ischemia: Pt's EKG on presentation showed nonspecific ST depressions in the lateral leads with a prior EKG report noting nonspecific ST changes in the lateral leads as well but CE not elevated.
Repeat EKG on hospital day 2 showed resolution of ST depression.
The changes on admission were felt to be due to demand ischemia in setting of UGIB.
Metastatic prostate and lung cancer/pain control/overall goals of care: The pt's CT of the chest showed a new mass consistent with metastatic lung cancer.
Four days before his expiration the patient was taken off all antibiotics, anti-coagulants and immunosuppressants and maintained on morphine and ativan for comfort.
