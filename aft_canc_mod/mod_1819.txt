He also noted chest pressure earlier today while walking to his car, associated with diaphoresis and palpitations.
On arrival to the ICU, he feels well and has no complaints.
Past Medical History: - rectal cancer s/p chemoradiation and surgical resection complicated by radiation proctitis ([**2145**]) - chronic incontinuence [**1-6**] radiation proctitis - radiation ileitis s/p ileumectomy - diastolic CHF with preserved EF (60% [**9-/2151**]) - CABG [**2140**] - Atrial fib - in NSR s/p cardioversion, maintained on dofetilide - severe aortic stenosis - h/o C. diff - h/o cellulitis in R leg  Social History: Lives with his wife.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM Vitals: 97.0 62 130*62 12 100% on RA General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress, pale HEENT: Sclera pale, dry membranes, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, severe aortic stenosis murmur Abdomen: diffuse surgical scars with a midline reducible hernia, soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema .
CTA INDICATION: 84-year-old man with rectal cancer, status post surgical resection and chemoradiation [**2145**], complicated by radiation proctitis, now with lower GI bleeding and dropping hematocrit from 30 to 16 status post 7 units transfusion.
FINDINGS: Moderate-sized bilateral simple pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis of the lung bases are seen.
The imaged portion of the heart demonstrates moderate coronary arterial calcification.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CTA: The abdominal aorta has moderate atherosclerotic calcifications, without evidence of aneurysmal dilation.
Minimal calcifications are seen at the origin of the celiac, SMA and renal arteries, with normal opacification of the vessels distally.
There is no evidence of active hemorrhage within the small/large bowel loops.
Prominent vessels are seen along the wall of the cecum and proximal ascending colon, without evidence of active bleed.
No significant retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy is seen.
Multiple hypodense lesions are seen in both kidneys, consistent with simple renal cysts, with the largest in the lower pole of the right kidney measuring 3.9 cm and the largest exophytic cyst in the lower pole of the left kidney measuring 5.4 cm.
Mild right hydroureteronephrosis has progressed since the prior study and ureter is dilated up to the level of the pelvic inlet and likely relates to post-radiation changes.
Nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland, is stable since the earlier study of [**2148-9-11**].
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Multiple stones seen along the dependent aspect of the urinary bladder, likely relate to chronic outlet obstruction.
Diffuse thickening of the rectal wall with perirectal fat stranding, likely represent post-radiation changes.
Small bilateral lymph nodes seen along the external iliac chain do not meet CT criteria for significant adenopathy and are stable since the prior study.
There is no pelvic free fluid.
BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: No bone lesions suspicious for infection or malignancy are detected.
Moderate degenerative changes are seen in the lumbar spine, worse at L2-L3 level, with near complete reduction of disc space and mild retrolisthesis of L2 on L3 .
No evidence of active gastro-intestinal bleeding.
Bilateral moderate simple pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis of the lung bases.
Atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta, without aneurysmal dilation.
Bilateral simple renal cortical cysts.
Mild right hydroureteronephrosis, possibly secondary to radiation.
Multiple bladder stones.
Impression:	Small hiatal hernia Congestion and nodularity in the stomach body Polyp in the fundus Normal mucosa in the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to proximal jejunum.
jejunum:	 Flat Lesions	Two small localized lymphangiectasia were seen in the mid jejunum and distal jejunum.
There was no stenosis or sticture noted in the jejumum distal to the pills.
No angioectasia or active bleeding was seen in the examined small bowel.
Impression:	Lymphangiectasia in the mid jejunum and distal jejunum A few pills were seen in the mid jejunum.
There was no stenosis or sticture noted in the jejumum distal to the pills.
No angioectasia or active bleeding was seen in the examined small bowel.
Colonoscopy: Findings:	 Mucosa:	Ulceration and friability with contact bleeding were noted in the rectum.
There was no fresh blood or melena above.
No ischemia, angioectasia, polyps or tumor.
Impression:	Ulceration and friability in the rectum compatible with Radiation proctitis Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum  Brief Hospital Course: 84 yo M with rectal cancer s/p chemoradiation and resection, chronic incontinence, afib, CAD s/p CABG, dCHF and severe AS, presenting with 3 days of melena and a Hct of 16 from 30. .
# GI Bleed: Pt presented with large amount of melena, and incontinent due to surgery.
Thought to be an upper GI bleed due to presence of melena.
Had an EGD performed while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] showing no evidence of bleeding down to the jejunum.
The patient was then prepped for 2 days and underwent a colonscopy that revealed radiation changes to the rectum but no source for brisk bleed.
# Atrial fib: Pt currently in NSR on dofetilide and PRN metoprolol at home.
# CAD: Initially held  metoprolol and aspirin.
# Hypokalemia: Pt noted to be hypokalemic to low 3s for 3 days prior to discharge.
Etiology was likely secondary to loose stools/diarrhea while in house.
