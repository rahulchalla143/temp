Her post-operative course was complicated by a painless lower GI bleed with bright red blood per rectum and maroon stools on [**2165-3-2**].
GI was consulted and she underwent a tagged RBC scan on [**2165-3-2**] which showed no active bleeding.
The patient is undergoing a colonoscopy on [**2165-3-5**] with concern for a possible diverticular bleed or disease related to her metastatic lung cancer.
Meanwhile, the patient denies any abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.
She herself had not noted any blood and the nurses report no bloody stools for 24 hours.
She has never had a colonoscopy and never had GI bleeding before.
She denies any epigastric burning associated with meals.
ROS: Denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, cough.
Denies current weight loss, fevers or chills.
Past Medical History: *Metastatic lung cancer with history of RUL pancoast tumor s/p chemo, radiation, and RUL lobectomy in [**2151**] which was complicated by a bronchopleural fistula, mets to spine.
PET in [**1-20**]  showed an intensely FDG avid large left apical lung mass with destruction of the left T2 through T4 ribs and T2 through T4 vertebral bodies and/or posterior elements with extension of the mass into the spinal canal at the T3 level without definite evidence for spinal cord compression.
Negative Head MRI in [**1-20**] for metastatic disease.
* S/p right shoulder fracture s/p fall * LUL lung cancer recurrence in [**2162**]   Social History: The patient lives with her husband and 2 daughters.
Physical Exam: Tc -98.8 P=101 BP=180/79 (A-line in left upper extremity) BP range from 93-180 RR=22 99% O2 on 3 liters O2  Gen - NAD, AOX3, appears much older than stated age HEENT - NG tube in place, MMM, no JVD Heart - Increased rate, regular rhythm, Grade II/VI holosystolic murmur at LUSB Lungs - CTAB anteriorly Back - Staples in place cervical, thoracic spine Abdomen - Soft, NT, ND, no HS, + BS Ext - No C/C/E, SCD bilaterally, +2 d. pedis bilaterally   Pertinent Results: CT ABD W&W/O C  [**2165-3-3**] 2:59 PM  1.
No evidence of free intraperitoneal air or fluid.
Multiple hepatic cysts.
Bilateral small to moderate pleural effusion.
A widespread soft tissue edema.
GI BLEEDING STUDY  [**2165-3-2**]  IMPRESSION: No evidence of active bleeding.
CT T-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2165-2-25**] 4:43 PM  IMPRESSION: Large left apical mass and paraspinal mass producing marked destructive changes of the first three thoracic vertebra with invasion of the spinal canal.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2165-2-25**] 4:42 PM  IMPRESSION: Large left apical calcified mass is again demonstrated and paraspinal mass with extensive destructive change of the upper thoracic spine with material present within the spinal canal that appears to surround the cord.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
There is a left Pancoast tumor with post-radiation changes in left paramediastinal region.
The remainder of the lungs are clear without evidence of consolidation.
Colonoscopy [**2165-3-6**]: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid and descending colon Internal hemorrhoids Bleeding likely secondary to diverticulosis.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 58 year old female with a history of metastatic lung cancer to bone who initially presented for spinal decompression secondary to mets and subsequently developed what appears to be a lower GI bleed transferred from the SICU to the medical service  #.Lower GI bleed - Switched to PO PPI.
- Colonoscopy on [**3-6**] showed no active bleeding with diverticulosis and internal hemorrhoids, recommended high fiber diet.
- The patient received a total of 6 units of blood during this hospitalization and her hematocrit has remained stable with no more significant bleeding with her last Hct being 28.
- She tolerated a regular diet with boost post colonoscopy without difficulty.
- She has had no additional bloody stools for >48 hours.
Metastatic lung cancer with bony mets - Her pain is well-controlled on oxycontin 30 mg PO Q12 and vicodin prn.
Hypoxia - The patient had an O2 requirement of [**1-18**] liters in the ICU which was likely secondary to bilateral effusions after multiple blood products in ICU and malignancy as well.
# Right scapular wound - Plastics consulted on [**3-6**].
Plastics here felt that this was most likely a pressure ulcer and recommended wet to dry dressings [**Hospital1 **].
# Hyponatremia - Urine lytes confirmed that the etiology of her hyponatremia is SIADH.
Dolasetron Mesylate 12.5 mg IV Q8H:PRN nausea   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Lower GI bleed secondary to diverticulosis Metastatic lung cancer to bone with spinal compression Blood loss anemia   Discharge Condition: Stable.
