Also reports feeling anxious x 1 week; her husband gave her oxycodone for this with good effect.
Her husband notes that she has been slightly confused since Friday, but attributes it temporally to oxycodone.
She states has been vomiting once per morning, bilious fluid but no blood.
She was given 1L IVF with SBP in 70s.
Past Medical History: # metastatic pancreatic cancer with metastasis to ovary # type 2 diabetes # hypercholesterolemia # h/o DVT this summer.

ONC HX: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55-year-old female with unresectable pancreatic cancer diagnosed in [**6-13**].
CT scan and a diagnostic laparoscopy was negative for any metastatic sites in [**7-14**].
In [**8-13**], a CT showed a new pelvic mass that was rapidly growing.
This turned out to be a metastasis on excision (TAH, RSO) on [**2122-11-3**].
She had a L popliteal vein DVT and is currently on Lovenox.
She has continued to have persistent nausea and emesis.
worked part time as clerical worker   Family History: Significant for a cousin with prostate cancer.
No cervical LAD.
JVP flat with positive hepatojugular reflux.
LUNGS: Decreased breath sounds to right base.
crackles to left base.

On the right, however, there is again evidence of pleural effusion with associated atelectatic changes.
Numerous hypodense hepatic lesions, new since [**11-12**] with appearance suspicious for hepatic abscesses.
Peribiliary enhancement consistent with cholangitis.
New bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis.
Questionable thickening of the ascending colon could relate to a serosal metastasis.
Subcutaneous abscess adjacent to a jejunal feeding tube entry site.
Bilateral filling defects in the common femoral veins consistent with deep venous thrombosis.
LENIs [**3-1**] - Bilateral occlusive thrombus involving the bilateral common femoral and superficial femoral veins as well as the right popliteal vein.
Successful therapeutic and diagnostic paracentesis.
Successful ultrasound-guided aspiration of liver abscess.
Brief Hospital Course: 55 yo F with metastatic pancreatic cancer who presents from clinic to OMED floor for evaluation of extreme fatigue, altered mental status and transferred to MICU for hypotension.
# Metastatic pancreatic cancer  Patient was made DNR/DNI after discussion between patient, family, and attendings.
# Hypotension: Differential diagnosis included sepsis vs. PE vs. cardiac tamponade, vs. cardiac ischemia with all but sepsis being less likely.
Other possible consideration for pt's hypotension included IVC compression secondary to mass effect from pancreatic CA.
Sources of sepsis included intrabadominal abscess, J-tube site infections, SBP.
Less likely causes include PNA (not seen on CXR), UTI (UA poor sample with 20 epis), or meningitis.
She was started on vanc/ceftaz/flayl for broad coverage.
A CT abd/pelvis was obtained on the night of admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] given concern for abdominal tenderness and new onset ascites which revealed a large subcutaneous abscess around the site of the patient's J tube, multiple hepatic lesions suspicious for either abscess vs. necrotic metastases, possible cholangitis, and new large ascites.
After further discussions with the ICU team, her oncologists, and her family, it was decided to make the patient CMO on hospital day 3.
# Confusion: Most likely [**3-11**] hypotension in the setting of infection with some improvement in her mental status after starting pressors.
Neuro-onc was also contact[**Name (NI) **] who felt the utility of a LP was low and that brain mets were unlikely to be contributing as the patient had had a negative head MRI recently.
# FTT / Weakness: Weakness and failure to thrive in setting of cancer and poor nutritional status.
# J tube leakage: Patient with persistent leakage in spite of multiple IR J tube exchanges in the past.
IR was contact[**Name (NI) **] who felt the tube was in good location and that there was no role in replacing the tube.
# LE edema: No hx of cardiac disease.
Likely secondary to hypoalbuminemic state, bilateral DVTs, and obstructive pelvic mass.
