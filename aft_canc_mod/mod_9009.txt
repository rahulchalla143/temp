History of Present Illness: 60 yo M w/ remote history of melanoma (Stage III/IV s/p resection w/o recurrence x 15 yrs; he actually had two primaries, no metastasis), Afib on coumadin, HTN who presented to the [**Hospital **] hospital s/p focal motor seizure w/ secondary generalization abated by time EMS arrived.
He was tx w/ ativan at [**Location (un) **] ED, admitted for monitroing and further work up, and subsequently was found to have an episdoe of VT on telemtery and cyanosis, unresponsive clinically with SBPs in 200s and spontaneous conversion to afib/rvr with post-ictal confusion, intubated for airway protection, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Per EMS report apparently there was post-ictal confusion.
No prior unusual symptoms, restarted going to the GYM.
No prior CVAs, Szs, changes in cognition, concentration or motor tasks.
smal left frontal petechial hemorrhage w/ adjacent edema, while MRI w/ and w/o showed small left frontal petechial hemorrahge w/ edema and concern for leptomeningeal enhancement (in same region hemorrhage) as well as  w/ PWMD.
Initial 20 minute EEG was notable for some slowing (left temporal) but no frank spikes/wave.
wasn noted to have VT on telemetry.
No CPR given.
In MICU with lightened sedation, pt followed commands appropriately w/o focal neurological deficit.

IMAGING & STUDIES: ------------------ [**2165-2-14**] EEG There were no pushbutton events during the recording session for events themselves.
The routinely sampled record, however, shows periods of generalized delta activity suggesting either a projected abnormality or deep neuronal dysfunction.
There were some subtle features of a left temporal dysfunction from time to time but it was not consistent or persistent finding.
There were no clear interictal epileptic discharges noted on automated sampled and automated detection algorithm.
The cardiac monitor shows an irregularly irregular rhythm.
[**2165-2-14**] Cerebrospinal fluid (lumbar puncture): NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Outside MRI with and without contrast: Showed a faint diffusion lesion in the precentral gyrus and the signal abnormality was also visible on the FLAIR image.
There was mild contrast enhancement of this region.
MRI showed at  least two small foci of "blooming" susceptibility artifact, centrally-located within a faint vascular blush related to an abnormal relatively superficial vessel.
On the current examination, there is no evidence of true  arteriovenous malformation, and the abnormality above may relate to an underlying developmental venous anomaly (DVA), perhaps with superimposed stenosis, and secondary venous hypertension complicated by hemorrhage.
An occult dural arteriovenous fistula is a more remote consideration, as there is no evidence of additional abnormal venous drainage on either study.
Extensive low-attenuation in bihemispheric white matter, as on the MR study; this most likely represents the sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease, likely relate to the vascular risk factors in the given history.
Acute-chronic inflammatory changes involving, particularly, the left maxillary sinus and, to a lesser extent, the left anterior ethmoidal air cells; this appears worse since the recent outside study and should be correlated clinically.
COMMENT: A preliminary interpretation raising the possibility of "small cavernoma (associated) with a DVA; however, hemorrhagic melanoma metastasis cannot be completely excluded" was provided by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], at the time of the examination.
Neither the MR nor the CT appearance is suggestive of cavernous angioma and, particularly given the association with abnormal vessel(s) in the region, hemorrhagic melanoma metastasis would be a very remote possibility; however, as he recommended, comparison with an even earlier MR study would be quite useful.
[**2165-2-18**] LUMBAR PUNCTURE: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
[**2165-2-19**] 24 HOUR EEG: No epileptiform activity.
Brief Hospital Course: 60 yo M w/ remote history of melanoma (Stage III/IV s/p resection w/o recurrence x 15 yrs), Afib on coumadin, HTN who presented to the [**Hospital **] hospital s/p focal motor seizure w/ secondary generalization and course c/b episode of LOC/VT/Intubation now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further w/up.
# Seizure/LOC.
He was continued on keppra for seizures and will be discharged on this as well.
#3 LP results pending at d/c, remainder (-) for malignant cells.
# Afib with aberrancy.
Telemetry strips of wide complex tachycardia were reviewed and felt to be afib with aberrancy.
His cardiac enzymes were negative at OSH and Echo showed only LVH, no wall motion abnormalities.
# Aspiration pna.
Patient had a temp of 100.3F, w/ elevated WBC, and CXR concerning for possible aspiration.
UA consistent with prerenal etiology.
# Depression.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Small left posterior frontal (precentral gyrus) infarction Small posterior frontal petechial hemorrhage, possibly due to a cavernous hemangioma with developmental venous anomaly Focal motor seizures Pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Your CT scan and MRI images were reviewed: you were found to have changes in the blood vessels and lining of your brain.
Right now, we cannot be sure of the cause of these changes.
We performed several lumbar punctures and EEGs: these studies were negative for malignant cells and seizure activity respectively.
If Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**] does not find any evidence that the left posterior frontal lesion is caused by a metastasis, but is due to an ischemic stroke, then Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from the Stroke/Cerebrovascular Division is willing to see you in follow-up as well.
While you were in hospital, you developed a pneumonia, and we started you on antibiotics which you will finish 2 days after you leave the hospital today.
