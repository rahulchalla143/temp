Admission Date:  [**2160-7-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-8-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2083-2-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: IVH   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2160-7-29**] External Ventricular drain placement [**2160-8-1**] Stereotactic biopsy of brain lesion   History of Present Illness: This is a 77 year old man who was in usual state of health when he had the sudden onset of suboccipital / upper cervical neck pain and a sense of fullness in his ears bilaterally.
He felt faint and nauseated, so EMS was called by family.
He was taken to an OSH where a CT head was done showing a right parietal lobar hemorrhage with extension into the right lateral ventricle.
He was seen in the ED where he described persistent suboccipital pain, frontal headache, and nausea.
Minimal EtOH consumption.
Awakes to voice Cooperative with Oriented to person, place, and date Language: Speech fluent with good comprehension and repetition Pupils equally round and reactive to light Extraocular movements intact and conjugate without nystagmus Facial strength intact and symmetric Palatal elevation symmetrical.
Moderate- Large hemorrhage centered in the right frontal lobe, with edematous/hemorrhagic appearance of the adjacent left frontal lobe with surrounding edema.
This pattern is concerning for amyloid angiopathy and/or underlying mass/vascular cause.
Recommend MR imaging following resolution of acute hemorrhage for further characterization if not contra-indicated.
Surrounding vasogenic and diffuse cerebral edema, causing right ventricular compression and 3-mm leftward shift.
Diffuse intraventricular hemorrhage, predisposes to obstructive hydrocephalus, though comparison to prior imaging is requested.
Right frontal EVD terminates beyond the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**] at the anterior part of the third ventricle.
No new hemorrhage or evidence of hydrocephalus, over 14 hour interval  [**2160-7-30**] MRI with and without contrast IMPRESSION: Heterogenous contrast enhancement of the mass in the splenium of the corpus callosum, substantiating the presumed diagnosis of a butterfly glioma with secondary hemorrhage.
Mass effacing the right lateral ventricle with hemorrhagic components, better appreciated on the comparison MRI study.
Persistent intraventricular and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
No significant change in hemorrhage, edema or ventricular size.
No evidence of hydrocephalus.
Hemorrhagic mass lesion centered in the corpus callosum splenium largely unchanged in size and character.
No evidence of infarct, herniation or new hemorrhage.
No significant change in ventricular size compared to [**8-4**], [**2159**].
No evidence of hydrocephalus.
Hemorrhagic mass centered in the right thalamus and corpus callosum, not significantly changed.
Minimal subarachnoid hemorrhage overlying the left parietal lobe.
No new intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of acute large vascular territorial infarction.
[**2160-8-8**] CT Head: No change from previous scan.
LENS [**2160-8-8**] No evidence of bilateral lower extremity DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 54563**] was admitted to the ICU for Q1 hour neurochecks and systolic blood pressure control less than 140 in the setting of Intraventricular hemorrhage and hydrocephalus.
STAT head CT demonstrated progressive hydrocephalus and an External Ventricular Drain was placed at the ICU beside.
Post procedure CT head demonstrated catheter within the right lateral ventricle terminating within the 3rd ventricle without new hemorrhage.
MRI with contrast was completed on [**7-30**] which demonstrated a enhancing mass within the splenium of the corpus callosum.
Subsequently, a right EVD was replaced in routine fashion without complication at the bedside.
Post procedure CT scan showed a R EVD placement without new hemorrhages or infarct.
There were episodes of right arm tremors which were thought to possibly be focal seizures.
In the afternoon he was brought to the OR for a stereotactic biopsy.
Post-op CT head on [**8-2**] showed no new hemorrhage.
Pt remained over the next 2 days with a fluctuating neurological exam.
Head CT on [**8-4**] demonstrated stable ventricular size without evidence of new hemorrhage.
He had some elevated ICP's to the 30's but this was when he was OOB.
A CT head was done on [**8-8**] and showed no change in ventricular size.
His EVD was removed without complication.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Constipation.
16. olanzapine 5 mg Tablet, Rapid Dissolve Sig: One (1) Tablet, Rapid Dissolve PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for agitation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: Bilatteral corpus callosum lesion Intraventricular hemorrhage Hydrocephalus Seizures Glioblastoma Multiforme Dysphagia Malnutrition Post-op Delirium Hypertension hyponatremia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
