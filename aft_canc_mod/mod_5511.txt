Esophageal Bleed - Patient developed esophageal bleed s/p upper GI endoscopy on [**2108-8-2**], although endoscopy on [**2108-8-5**] did not demonstrate continued bleeding.
On second day of admission, patient continued to report maroon stools and had several episodes of hemoptysis.
Patient was transferred to MICU for urgent upper GI endoscopy, which demonstrated an adherent clot in the distal esophagus at 38cm without any active bleeding.
A repeat EGD on [**8-8**] demonstrated a large 2cm x 1cm esophageal mucosal tear on the posterior wall with adherent clot at 38 cm at the proximal end of the tear.
[**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully.
Mediastinal LAD - Patient's initial presentation of dysphagia was most likely secondary to mediastinal LAD with unclear etiology.
CT of the chest at [**Hospital1 18**] demonstrated large LAD in the mediastinum and chest.
It is not clear to us if this a new process or an old process that has been stable.
If there is any change in the lymphadenopathy, she may need further work-up by biopsy or bronchopscopy.
Atrial Fibrillation - Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation.
She was previously on coumadin but was discontinued in [**2095**] after bladder cancer for unclear reasons.
CAD s/p MI - Not on ASA at home given MDS as above.
HTN - on low-dose BB.
