Admission Date:  [**2113-5-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2113-6-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-5-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: OTOLARYNGOLOGY  Allergies: Ancef  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8480**] Chief Complaint: Laryngeal cancer  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy, tracheal biopsy ([**5-15**]) Total Laryngectomy ([**5-23**])   History of Present Illness: Patient is a 56 year old male who presented to [**Hospital 1727**] Medical Center on [**5-8**] with stridor and respiratory distress.
Prior to presentation he had complained of 5 weeks of cough, shortness of breath, and a sore throat for which he had been treated with steroids and antibiotics without improvement.
A laryngoscopy at the OSH showed severe narrowing of the subglottic area and CT scan showed a large laryngeal mass concerning for neoplasm.
An emergent trachestomy/bronchoscopy was done by the thoracic surgery team and biopsy of the mass were sent.
These biopsies were suspicious for adenoid cystic carcinoma.
Of note, bronchial washings were sent which were positive for MSSA.
LLE fracture after MVC [**2081**]  Social History: Denies alcohol use Smoked 1ppd tobacco for 30 years but quit 1 month prior to presentation Works as an electrician  Family History: noncontributory  Physical Exam: AVSS, 98% on 35% TM NAD OC/OP wnl, no obvious masses, symmetric palate elevation, midline uvula, FOM soft Normal anterior rhinoscopy.
Nasopharynx with slight fullness on right side.
Supraglottis appears slightly erythematous, no obvious mass lesions are seen.
Vocal cords have a small amount of abduction bilaterally, but to a maximum of 2mm opening.
No true vocal fold lesions are seen but cannot rule out a submucosal thickening of the posterior glottis.
FOE via tracheotomy tube reveals circumferential narrowing below tracheotomy tip, but patent trachea and clear view to carina with no obvious massess.
The glottic, subglottic and proximal trachea appear diffusely abnormal.
Within the glottic and subglottic airway, diffuse soft tissue thickening is present with narrowing of the airway lumen.
The thickening is most pronounced posteriorly and laterally and results in luminal narrowing to approximately 4 mm in transverse dimension by about 7-9 mm in the anterior dimension.
Additionally, in the proximal trachea at the level of the thyroid gland, there is a more discrete 12 mm x 11 mm diameter rounded intraluminal opacity.
The tracheal walls remain mildly thickened to approximately the level of the aortic arch.
Increased number of mediastinal nodes are present, but there are no individual nodes measuring greater than 1 cm in diameter.
A small amount of pneumomediastinum is also present.
Multiple pulmonary emboli are present throughout the right pulmonary arterial system, involving the origin of the right middle lobe bronchus and extending into segmental branches, and also involving the intralobar and proximal right lower lobe pulmonary artery extending into segmental and subsegmental arteries.
Multiple peribronchiolar ground glass nodular opacities are present in the superior segment of the right lower lobe and a small solid 3-mm diameter left lower lobe nodule (image 48, series 3) is also present, as well as an additional 3 mm left lower lobe nodule laterally (imaged 220, series 4).
Trace right pleural effusion is present.
No suspicious lytic or blastic skeletal lesions are identified.
Multiplanar and 3D images confirm the presence of an intraluminal mass and adjacent luminal narrowing as well as circumferential thickening of the airway.
Additionally, on review of thin section axial images, there is apparent partial destruction of the cricoid cartilage.
Proximal tracheal intraluminal mass with contiguous circumferential thickening of the airway extending proximal to the level of the vocal cords.
Less prominent wall thickening below the mass extending at least to the level of the aortic arch with extensive stranding of the adjacent paratracheal fat.
Findings are concerning for circumferential involvement of adenoid cystic carcinoma with associated extensive submucosal spread.
Increased number of mediastinal nodes, without individual nodes meeting size criteria for enlargement.
Acute pulmonary emboli in the right pulmonary arterial system as described.
Two solid left lower lobe lung nodules, measuring less than 5 mm in diameter.
Although potentially benign, early foci of metastatic disease cannot be excluded.
Peribronchiolar ground glass nodules superior segment of right lower lobe, likely due to aspiration or early infection.
Small right pleural effusion.
...[**5-15**] CHEST PA/LAT: The patient is diagnosed with adenoid cystic carcinoma of the trachea.
There is no pleural effusion.
The sub 5-mm left lower lobe nodules diagnosed on the chest CT are below the resolution of this chest radiograph.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia.
Known adenoid cystic carcinoma of upper trachea.
On inspection of the posterior pharynx there was diffuse tissue infiltration throughout with crowding of the airway.
On endotracheal ultrasound immediately distal to the tracheostomy there was diffuse tracheal infiltration.
There was some mild oozing after the biopsy which spontaneously resolved.
Diffuse posterior pharyngeal tissue infiltration.
Diffuse tracheal thickening by ultrasound.
On the right, there is noncompressible thrombus within the right popliteal vein, which is only partially occlusive.
The right common femoral and superficial veins compress normally with normal flow, waveforms, and augmentation.
On the left, there is no evidence of noncompressible veins and all veins demonstrate normal flow, waveforms, and augmentation.
2) No DVT in the left lower extremity.
After multiple attempts, the right common femoral vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a micropuncture needle.
There was no evidence of duplication of the inferior vena cava.
The large draining vein in the left lower IVC was later cannulated with a C1 Cobra catheter with contrast injection demonstrating this to be a prominent lumbar vein.
Thus, there was no evidence of circumaortic or duplicated renal vein.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is moderately dilated athe sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is no aspiration into the airway, and no significant retention in the valleculae or pyriform sinuses is seen.
There is no evidence of active extravasation to suggest a leak in the area of surgery.
Once this was determined, thin barium was also administered to the patient in AP and lateral views and again no aspiration or leak at the area of surgery was identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of esophageal leak in the region of recent surgery.
BROWN/lfb  DIAGNOSIS:    A. Carina, endobronchial biopsy: Respiratory mucosa with acute and chronic inflammation and focal squamous metaplasia with mild to moderate atypia.
No carcinoma seen.
B Proximal trachea, endobronchial biopsy: Respiratory mucosa with acute and chronic inflammation and focal squamous metaplasia with mild to moderate atypia.
No carcinoma seen.
BROWN/lfb Previous biopsies:    [**Numeric Identifier 72343**]  CERVICAL ENDOBRONCHIAL AND PROXIMAL TRACHEA ENDOBRONCHIAL  DIAGNOSIS:    Tracheal biopsy: Low grade carcinoma with adenoid cystic features.
Note: Although the overall architectural and cytologic features are most suggestive of adenoid cystic carcinoma, the tumor shows very focal squamous differentiation which is not typical of adenoid cystic carcinoma.
Another tumor which can occur in this area and mimic adenoid cystic carcinoma on a small biopsy specimen is a basaloid squamous cell carcinoma, although they usually show more atypia, mitotic activity and necrosis than we see in this case.
Cytology was reviewed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10165**], who felt the findings were consistent with adenoid cystic carcinoma.
Larynx, subglottic, biopsy (A):         Carcinoma, most consistent with adenoid cystic carcinoma.
Lymph nodes, left neck level 3, dissection (B-C):         No carcinoma identified in nine lymph nodes (0/9).
Lymph nodes, left neck level 2, dissection (D):         No carcinoma identified in two lymph nodes (0/2).
Larynx, laryngectomy (E-AG):         A. Carcinoma, most consistent with adenoid cystic carcinoma with focal squamous differentiation, larynx.
No carcinoma identified in two lymph nodes (0/2).
C. Larynx with extensive squamous metaplasia and chronic inflammation.
There is ossification of this cartilage and tumor involves the bone at this site.
There is a focus suspicious for lymphovascular invasion.
No definitive perineural invasion is identified.
The pathologic stage for this subglottic tumor is T4a.
The main differential diagnosis of this tumor is an adenoid cystic carcinoma with squamous differentiation versus a basaloid squamous cell carcinoma.
The larynx shows extensive squamous metaplasia and chronic inflammation, however, no squamous dysplasia/carcinoma in situ is identified.
Immunohistochemical stains performed on a section of tumor show the tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin cocktail (AE1:AE3/CAM 5.2), smooth muscle actin, calponin, and p63.
CEA (unabsorbed) shows rare positivity of some squamous cells as well as rare ductal-type structures.
S-100 protein is non-contributory due to high background staining.
Based on the tumor morphology and results of the immunohistochemical studies (particularly cytokeratin and actin positivity), this tumor is interpreted to be an adenoid cystic carcinoma with squamous differentiation.
In the absence of a similar tumor elsewhere, this tumor is compatible with a laryngeal primary, as adenoid cystic carcinoma may occur in the larynx/trachea.
On arrival he was continued on the cefazolin for presumed pneumonia based on MSSA in a BAL.
In addition, multiple pulmonary emboli on the right were noted as well as two solid LLL lung nodule, benign in appearance.
A bronchoscopy was one by the IP service showing diffuse posterior pharyngeal tissue infiltration and diffuse tracheal thickening by ultrasound.
An ENT consult was obtained and a total laryngectomy was recommended for T4Nx laryngeal cancer, suspiscious for adenoid cystic carcinoma.
In preperation for the procedure, b/l lower extremetiy ultrasounds were done to search for a cause for the pulmonary embolus.
No DVT was noted in the left leg, but a near occlusive popliteal dvt was noted in the right.
The tracheal biopsies taken during the bronchoscopy at sites distal to the mass were consistent with respiratory mucosa with acute and chronic inflammation, and focal squamous metaplasia.
No cancer was seen in these biopsies.
The biopsies of the mass taken at the OSH were reviewed as well and were felt to show features most consistent with adenoid cystic carcinoma, although basaloid squamous cell carcinoma could not be ruled out.
He was therefore transferred to the ENT service and on [**5-23**] he underwent a total laryngectomy with modified left neck dissection.
He was kept NPO with a dilaudid pca for pain, and clindamycin and levofloxacin for perioperative prophylaxis.
On POD3 the heparin drip was restarted and the pain service was consulted for continuing pain not controlled by the PCA.
On POD6 Mr. [**Known lastname 72345**] began complaining of worsening dyspnea and faintness.
He then developed atrial fibrillation with RVR, with a rate of 150-200.
He was then given IV diltiazem and became hypotensive with a SBP of 70.
That evening he returned to sinus rhythm and became normotensive.
He continue to do well until POD8 when developed nausea and emesis, possibly related to the amiodarone which was therefore stopped.
In discussion with cardiology, it was felt that the episode of atrial fibrillation was a one time event and was unlikely to happen again.
Potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels were checked daily after the episode of atrial fibrillation.
A barium swallow study was obtained at this time which did not show an esophageal leak or tracheoesophageal fistula.
He will be visited at home by a VNA for respiratory care and assistance with tracheal stoma care.
The stoma stitches and staples were removed prior to discharge.
