Pt felt very itchy, with headache, rapid heart rate and SOB; thought related to not taking hydroxyurea, as that has helped with her itchines in the past but became progressively more short of breath and decided to call EMS.
Per Dr. [**Name (NI) 93802**] note she had a recent stress with possible RCA stenosis and moderate AS.
Pt denies any dietary indiscretion, any medication changes other than beging started on Levothyroxine and aspirin 81mg recently.
She denies any weight changes or increased lower extremity edema.
Past Medical History: - Diastolic and systolic CHF EF 45% 10/07 TTE, diastolic CHF 65% on pMIBI [**10-16**] - AFIB on coumadin - Mild AS - TIA [**4-12**] - Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] - phlebotomized in past, maintained on hydroxyurea - HTN - Hypercholesterolemia - Cataracts - LBBB, first degree AV block - Asthma - diagnosed in her 70s - Peripheral neuropathy   Social History: Lives alone in [**Location (un) **], independent ADLs, previously worked as  a bookkeeper.
Echo ([**2133-3-16**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.4cm2) The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
However, there are still signs of interstitial fluid overload and a clear cardiomegaly.
No evidence of pleural effusions.
Evaluate for effusion and lead placement.
There is slight increase in size of the bilateral moderate pleural effusions left greater than right.
There is linear atelectasis in the left base.

Abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with RV volume overload.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
Borderline PA systolic hypertension.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Normally-functioning mitral annuloplasty ring.
Magnitude of aortic stenosis is likely similar, but was not quantified as well on the current study.
CXR showed new pulmonary edema.
She was then started on a Lasix gtt and also on a Nitro gtt for persistent hypertension with pressures in the 200 which subsequent pressures in the 120 range.
An EKG showed lateral STD in the setting of hypertensive emergency.
She has remained afebrile and without focal signs of infection although yesterday pm had a rise in WBC to 16  Labs on presentation also notable for an INR of 4 on presentation, coumadin was held.
unclear what caused acute exacerbation (ischemia vs. hypertensive crisis).
Pt had negative enzymes, and no EKG changes but transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 for possible cath given recent stress with possible RCA lesion as culprit and no other clear source of acute HF.
Pt was kept there for 2 days while waiting for INR to drift down and giving vit K for this so she could proceed to cardiac catheterization (She has history of Afib on coumadin) She was found to have 3VD on cath on [**2133-3-19**] (70% LAD, 90% LCx, 60% RCA) --> therefore the plan was for CABG the following monday with possble mitral valve replacement given significant MR.
Her aorta pressures were elevated to 180's at the time of cath and she developed flash pulmonary edema and SOB.
She was continued on ASA, no beta blocker since borderline bradycardic, no statin since LDL 76 in [**10/2132**] off statins and no acute MI.
Workup for CABG was completed wiht carotid u/s without stenosis, vein mapping performed and lesser saph identified, LFTs WNL, albumin WNL, HbA1c WNL, Dental constult ok.  On [**3-21**] pt became dehydrated and orthostatic, feeling lightheaded and with a vagal response when standing up.
Postoperatively her rhythm was asystolic recovering to junctional then slow atrial fibrillation, for which she was unsuccessfully cardioverted.
Electrophysiology was consulted and on [**2133-3-27**] a PPM was placed.She was anticoagulated with Coumadin and Heparin for underlying AFib.
