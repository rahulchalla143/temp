Admission Date:  [**2123-7-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2123-8-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2081-12-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**] Chief Complaint: Generalized fatigue, dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bronchoscopy intubation arterial line placement PICC line placement  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 41 yo man w/ hypoplastic MDS and tracheobronchitis who presented to the heme malignancy service for admission on [**2123-7-31**] with hemoptysis and worsened cough, dyspnea.
During that admission, he also developed shortness of breath.
CXR showed worsening bilateral infiltrates.
Chest CTA that r/o PE and demonstrated diffuse b/l patchy airspace opacities and ground glass opacities (marked progression from previous CT [**7-13**]).
Pulmonary was consulted and performed a bronchoscopy on [**7-19**] that demonstrated tracheobronchitis with diffuse upper airway erythema and some mucosal bleeding, but no signs of Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage.
BAL washings were sent which were negative for bacterial,viral or fungal organisms.
Etiology of the patient's respiratory decompensation was not clear but was believed to be likely secondary to the ATG therapy or related to an underlying viral infection.
Pt improved with these limited interventions and repeat CXR on [**7-23**] showed marked improvement compared to earlier one on [**7-19**].
He was then re-admitted on [**9-1**]/05 with generalized fatigue.
Patient's presentation was thought most likely serum sickness secondary to antithrombocyte globulin.
Of note, patient had severe headache but had negative head CT. One day later, patient re-presented with worsened sob as above.
Unit HPI: cc: unit transfer for worsening hypoxia and dyspnea .
HPI: pt is a lovely 41 yo man w/ hypoplastic MDS and tracheobronchitis who presented to the heme malignancy service for admission on [**2123-7-31**] with hemoptysis and worsened cough, dyspnea.

Of note, patient had severe headache but had negative head CT. One day later, patient re-presented with worsened sob as above.
He was afebrile (but on steroids) and his vitals were otherwise stable.
Repeat chest CT with diffuse, bilateral alveolar opacities thought to be ?drug toxicity, diffuse viral pneumonia, ?TRALI.
Over next days, patients resp status waxed and waned but oxygen requirement steadily increased.
Steroids were increased for concern for DAH, lasix intermittently given for concern for chf.
SOB noted to be worse at night.
Pulm consulted and wished for bronch, but tenuous resp status of concern.
Today, patient acutely hypoxic, dyspneic on floor, requiring 100% NRB and high flow oxygen with sats in 80'[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 153**] called for emergent transfer.
Anesthesia called immediately and patient intubated on floor.

[**Hospital **] [**Hospital 153**] Hospital Course Plan: 41 yo man w/ hypoplastic MDS worsening hypoxia, ARDS, most likely as result of ATG therapy.
1) Hypoxia/resp failure: ARDS w/ bilateral infiltrates on CXR and CT, P/F ratio 78.
The ddx is large; has completed tx for bacterial and atypical pneumonias.
Caspofungin is still on board for possible diffuse fungal pna as a cause, will keep on as he is immunosuppressed on steroids.
Also was treated for DAH and acute lung injury from ATG with high dose steroids, now tapering, will likely need a 1wk taper.
Thoracic Surgery followed, VATS biopsy was not indicated at the time as would likely have had nonspecific findings after all his treatments.
He was kept on PCV for ARDS ventilation.
Desatted with disruption of PEEP during bronch, requiring high PEEP due to parenchymal disease.
Some improvement of oxygenation with diuresis.
Respiratory status stable, with only very gradual improvement, thought to likely be slow wean.
Thought to be secondary to tracheal perf seen on CT, although not seen on bronch (?sealed off already).
The differential also included esophageal perforation, which was considered unlikely as the patient had no history of esophageal intubation.
Also on the differential Could also be secondary to barotrauma.
Repeat CT still inconclusive for tracheal tear, no pneumothorax.
During the day of [**8-21**], the patient has been having more bloody secretions via suctioning from his ETT, requiring higher FiO2s.
The patient began to have more respiratory distress after being repositioned in bed at around midnight of [**8-21**].
CXR was taken and showed worsening bibasilar opacities, suggesting fluid or blood.
