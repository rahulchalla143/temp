He reports orthopnea but no PND.
In clinic today, he was using accessory muscles of respiration and was mildly diaphoretic, and his O2 sat on room air was 97%, dropping to 94% with ambulation.
He reports no fever or chills, no URI symptoms, no recent travel, no changes in his medications.
Pt also reports ~5 episodes of chest pain in the last few weeks which he describes as pressure on his mid-sternum and usually occurs during exertion.
There is no associated nausea or vomiting.
He says he takes a [**12-29**] tablet of Xanax when he gets this pain sometimes which seems to help.
He cannot take nitroglycerin because of his Viagra.
Past Medical History: 1. metastatic carcinoid tumor, Dx'ed [**2123**] -was on a study drug for a year and a half (ended about a year ago) and was on octreotide for a few months earlier this year but stopped because of diarrhea 2. hypertension 3. hyperlipidemia 4. carotid endarterectomy [**2120**] 5. depression/anxiety 6. cellulitis 2 weeks ago, given Keflex IV at [**Hospital3 **], now resolved 7.
DM2/prediabetic state: random blood sugar was high, was on glyburide for a brief time but made his sugars low so stopped 8. anxiety attack [**2110**] (collapsed), diagnosed in [**2120**] as MI 9. basal cell carcinoma (chest, low back, MOHS on cheek [**3-31**] and [**7-1**])   Social History: Lives alone, has two daughters Distant tobacco use (25 pack-years, quit 30 years ago), distant EtOH use (quit 28 yrs ago), no drugs  Family History: early CAD   Physical Exam: VS: T 97.7, HR 97, BP 140/52, RR 20, O2sat 97% on RA Gen: awake, alert, conversant, elderly man, mildly short of breath HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, MMM Neck: supple, JVP elevated (~8cm) Chest: fine cracles at left base, otherwise CTA CV: RRR, nl S1S2, no m/r/g, distant heart sounds Abd: S/ND, mildy tender to palpation in LLQ Ext: WWP, 1+ LE edema bilaterally, no c/c Neuro: nonfocal   Pertinent Results: [**2127-8-1**] 03:30PM   PLT COUNT-201 [**2127-8-1**] 03:30PM   NEUTS-69.9 LYMPHS-23.5 MONOS-4.8 EOS-1.1 BASOS-0.7 [**2127-8-1**] 03:30PM   WBC-9.2 RBC-4.68 HGB-14.6 HCT-42.0 MCV-90 MCH-31.3 MCHC-34.8 RDW-13.7 [**2127-8-1**] 03:30PM   TSH-4.0  [**2127-8-1**] 03:30PM   CK-MB-NotDone cTropnT-<0.01 [**2127-8-1**] 03:30PM   CK(CPK)-50 [**2127-8-1**] 03:30PM   GLUCOSE-125* UREA N-14 CREAT-1.0 SODIUM-138 POTASSIUM-4.1 CHLORIDE-101 TOTAL CO2-22 ANION GAP-19  Brief Hospital Course: 1.
On [**8-2**], pt was reporting improvement of symptoms and able to walk around his room with 4L O2 NC.
The following day he reported feeling worse, with increasing SOB, and was found to now be in oliguric renal failure.
CXR [**8-3**] 8am showed showed atelectasis with possible superimposed pneumonia.
Emergent TTE showed decreased EF (30%), anteroapical infarct with moderate-to-severe overall left ventricular contractile dysfunction; bicusapid aortic valve with at least mild aortic stenosis.
After his ARF resolved, he was cathed [**8-15**], showing persisting right heart failure [**1-29**] tricuspid regurg.
2. chest pain -MI (no ischemic changes on EKG) vs. GERD vs. anxiety vs. PE (CTA negative) Cardiac enzymes were negative.
He was monitored on tele, with no abnormalities.
HTN/hyperlipidemia/CAD Norvasc and Lipitor were continued initially, but the anti-hypertensive regimen was changed in MICU (see below), and lipitor was stopped due to transaminitis.
5. depression/anxiety -continued Paxil, Xanax .
PT felt he would be able to tolerate a total of [**2-28**] hours of PT per day spread across multiple sessions in an acute rehab setting.
Hypoxic respiratory failure:  On hospital day 3, the patient began to have desaturations requiring 100% NRB to maintain oxygen saturation.
His hypoxia was attributed to a right lower lobe pneumonia and congestive heart failure given his new wall motion abnormality with an EF of 35-40%.
He was also given lasix for diuresis given his positive fluid status.
However, anxiety alone could not explain his persistent oxygen requirement.
A chest CT was performed to look for parenchymal disease that was not evident on plain films.
The CT showed bilateral pleural effusions with the right greated than the left.
He was started on hydralazine and insosorbide mononitrate for afterload reduction.
Given his persistent oxygen requirement a diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis was performed to rule out a malignant or infected effusion.
Approximately 1 litre of clear yellow fluid that was consistent with a transudate was removed from the right.
Hypotension:  His hypotension was concerning for SIRS/early sepsis given his intial concurrent leukocytosis and elevated lactate.
Metabolic acidosis:  His initial metabolic acidosis was likely due to lactic acidosis secondary to hypoperfusion.
ARF:  The acute renal failure was likely secondary to contrast nephropathy and overdiuresis with lasix given his intial presentation with CHF.
His FeUrea was consistent with pre-renal.
Renal felt that he had a resolving ATN in the setting of hypotension and recommended repleting half his urine output with 1/2NS for a resolving ATN.
He initially appeared to be volume overloaded on exam and aggressive diuresis was attempted once his creatinie returned to [**Location 213**].
Hepatitis:  He had normal LFTs prior to his episode of hypotension.
An ultrasound showed old metastasis and fluid overload.
Initially, the possibility of cyanide toxicity was thought to contribute to his presentation give his herbal supplements.
Coagulopathy:  His elevated PT/PTT was likely secondary to acute liver failure.
There was no evidence of aute bleeding initially, but his hematocrit decreased 48 to 39 after two liters iv fluids.
His coagulopathy could be attributed to live dysfunction, however, a mild DIC could not be ruled out.
He was also given 3 Units of FFP prior to performing a thoracentesis for an elevated INR.
CAD:  He had a history of a previous MI and now has new anterior wall hypokinesis on echo and reduced EF 35%.
He ruled out for an acute MI by serial enzymes.
On admission to the ICU, he had an elevated potassium to 7.0.
Access:  He had a left IJ central line.
