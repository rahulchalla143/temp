While on the OMED service, she continued to spike fevers and her lab data showed a worsening leukocytosis to 22.1 with 20% bands.
Today she became tachycardic to the 140s which was fluid responsive but her SBP concurrently dropped from the 140s to the low 100s.
She underwent an abdominal MRI which showed worsening CBD dilation and numerous cm and sub-cm lesions in the liver, concerning for new mets vs. abscesses.
She went to [**Known lastname **] and became hypotensive to the systolic 70s prior to the procedure.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], her sedation was weaned and she was extubated without difficulty.
He was given PO vitamin K.  Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: ====================== Initially presented with abdominal pain to [**Hospital3 **], had T. Bili of 24.
Abdominal CT and ultraound demonstarted a pancreatic mass obstructing the bile duct.

Increased size of right and left lobe liver lesions compared to prior study, with focal adjacent biliary ductal dilatation.
Aside from aforementioned ductal dilatation adjacent to focal liver lesions, there is no generalized intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
Decompressed gallbladder, with unchanged cholelithiasis and mild wall thickening.
Findings may be seen with chronic cholecystitis.
Redemonstration of a simple left kidney cyst.
Significant dilatation of the common bile duct which is increased from the previous study.
There is also intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
The larger ones are not clearly enhancing and are of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images.
The concern is for multifocal abscesses (vs metastatic disease) and short-term followup is recommended.
Mass in the pancreatic head without significant change, compatible with pancreatic carcinoma.
No evidence to suggest acute cholecystitis .
Unilateral (left) venous USG: Focused exam without evidence of DVT.
If more complete exam for superficial thrombosis is desired, a dedicated exam can be obtained in the future.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 year-old woman with metastatic pancreatic cancer was admitted with cholangitis culminating in septic shock, now s/p biliary drainage procedure, improving.
# Cholangitis: Patient presented with fever and RUQ that was concerning for cholangitis.
The report came as new masses in the liver concerning for abscesses or cancer in the liver that were new from prior MRI 2 weeks prior as well as 2.5 cm ductal dilation (See report for details).
Patient became tachycardic and did not respond to 1.5 L NS.
On [**2149-5-11**] she was transfered to the oncology floor, where she tolerated regular diet and her pain was controlled.
Follow up with oncology was arranged and warning signs and symptoms were explained.
# Pancreatic cancer:  With possible metastatic disease in the liver.
MRI findings equivacal for abscess vs MRI.
# LUE swelling:  concerning for DVT while in the ICU and before placing midline.
It was thought it was due to fluid administration.

The following morning you had an MRI of your liver to evaluate your cancer and we found multiple new lesions and big ductal dilation.
You had a fever, you received more natibiotics, fluids and had an [**Hospital1 **] where they removed a lot of pus in your biliary ducts, your stent was removed and then a new metal stent was palced.
