Stable appearance of polycystic kidney disease with stable hemorrhagic cysts; decrease in size of multiple hepatic cysts.
Left anterior pneumothorax with chest tube in the posterior costophrenic sulcus.
No evidence of intra-abdominal fluid collection.
Status post right pelvic transplant kidney without evidence of hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collection.
Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
TEE ([**2188-5-28**]): No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
Right atrial appendage ejection velocity is good (>20 cm/s).
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
No evidence of endocarditis seen.
CXR [**6-1**]: Lordotic positioning and low inspiratory volumes.
There is patchy retrocardiac opacity.
The right hemidiaphragm is elevated, with slight atelectasis at the right base.
No gross effusion identified.
No pneumothorax detected.
Subcutaneous emphysema noted along the left chest wall.
Retrocardiac density may also be slightly worse.
CXR [**6-2**] AM: Patient has been extubated but overall the lung volumes, though small, are maintained, with persistent left lower lobe atelectasis.
Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
Minimal left pleural effusion extends into the major fissure.
No pneumothorax nor, basal left basal pleural tube in place.
Persistent subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall has not changed appreciably in extent.
Mild-to-moderate sized left-sided pneumothorax is essentially new since prior radiograph.
Lower lung opacity due to a combination of minimal atelectasis and presumed small pleural effusion is stable.
No new lung opacities of concern.
Subcutaneous emphysema along left lateral thoracic wall extending up to the axilla and supraclavicular regions is persisting, unchanged in extent and distribution.
No other significant interval changes in the chest since prior radiograph acquired six hours apart.
IMPRESSION New mild to moderate left pneumothorax.
Unchange left lung base opacity from small effusion and atelectasis   Brief Hospital Course: 57 y/o on Cellcept + Rapamune s/p renal transplant [**2181**] for PKD, HTN, HLD and polycythemia, who was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] in [**10/2187**] for presumed bacterial meningitis, who presented with fever and AMS and was found to have Enterococcal faecalis meningitis and bacteremia.
Severe Sepsis due to Enterococcus faecalis Meningitis and Bacteremia: He presented with AMS and sepsis from bacterial meningitis in the setting of immunosuppresion for his kidney transplant.
His peripheral blood revealed a leukocytosis at 14.6 with 94.9% PMNs.
CSF and blood cultures ultimately grew Enterococcus faecalis.
TEE was negative for endocarditis.
A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was negative for evidence of an intra-abdominal infection.
His peripheral blood WBC count also improved to 9 but after several days into his ICU stay it trended back up to 11.1 and he developed a fever to 101.8, at which time ID recommended the addition of linezolid.
Decision was made not to preform additional neurologic imaging to search for a possible menigeal focus of infection and instead treat with an erradicative regimen of extended antibiotics.
Following discontinuation of norepinephrine, he became hypertensive.
Subclavian Line Placement Complicated by Pneumothorax: His left subclavian line placement was complicated by a small pneumothorax.
Following extubation, his chest tube was removed on [**6-2**], although a small pneumothorax remained.
The patient had no further respiratory distress, and it was anticipated that the pneumothorax would continue to self-resolve.
There was no air leak detected at the former chest tube site.
Hypertension: Although initially hypotensive, he gradually became hypertensive after several days of treatment of his infection.
It was felt that his hypertension was in part due to agitation so he was switched from propofol to dexmedetomidine, with some improvement in his blood pressure.
His lisinopril continued to be held given concerns for potential renal injury in setting of gentamicin administration.
His Rapamune and Cellcept were held on admission as there was significantly more concern for complications from his infection than for rejection of his transplanted kidney.
Transitional Issues: - rapamycin dose increased to 2 mg daily - cellcept dose decreased to 250 mg twice daily - d/c'd home on gentamicin Q48H dosing and Q4H amp with survailence labs sent to the [**Hospital **] clinic - patient is a full code - lisinopril was held at the time discharge - would consider surgical evaluation for removal cystic kidneys as possible source of recurrent infections.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital **] Home Health Care  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY -Enteroccocus menigitis -enterococcus bacteremia -polycystic kidney disease status post renal transplant  SECONDARY: -hypertension -hypercholesterolemia -polycythemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You came to the hospital with fever and confusion.
You had previously been treated for meningitis, and you were found to have recurrence of this infection.
You were intubated and sedated for several days.
