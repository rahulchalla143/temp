Since discharge, pt had been doing well although continued to have hip and leg pain.
Last night, she developed fever to 101 and neck pain prompting her to return to the ED.
In the ED, she was afebrile with a leukocytosis of WBC 13.3 (N87%).
Patient has been alert and oriented throughout with morphine for pain control.
She has some pain which she says responded to the morphine.
Occasional walking but no formal exercise.

There is slight increase in surrounding edema seen.
There is no obliteration of the basal cisterns, or tonsillar herniation identified.
No hydrocephalus seen.
The findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the time of interpretation of the study on [**2196-12-4**] at 11:30 a.m.  MRI C,T,L Spine [**12-3**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis or abscess in the cervical region.
Small focus of enhancement in the medulla and enhancement in the cerebellar hemispheres due to brain metastatic disease, better evaluated on the brain MRI.
No extrinsic spinal cord compression or intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities  CT Head [**12-5**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Interval increase of now irregular hyperdensity in the right cerebellar hemisphere is highly concerning for bleeding of metastatic lesion.
No significant change compared to [**2196-12-5**]: Stable small right frontal subdural fluid collection, with virtual-complete resolution of pneumocephalus and the extraventricular drain in place.
Known extensive metastatic disease better-characterized on recent MR.  [**12-14**] LENI's: IMPRESSION: No DVT of either lower extremity.
Interval removal of ventricular drain, with stable right frontal subdural fluid collection, and no evidence of hydrocephalus or acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Multiple known metastatic lesions are much better-visualized on MR study of [**2196-12-3**].
Interval placement of VP shunt and Ommaya reservoir with post-surgical changes and pneumocephalus in the frontal region as expected.
No evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus or acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Multiple known metastatic lesions are better characterized on prior study (MR [**2196-12-3**]).
Punctate dense focus along the lateral margin of the right lateral ventricle, not definitely seen on previous studies possibly a tiny focus of subependymal hemorrhage.
As before, the ventriculostomy catheter via the left frontal approach terminates in the parenchyma of the left frontal lobe and not within the ventricle.Subtle density right cerebellum represents metastasis seen on MRI of [**2196-12-3**].
Brief Hospital Course: 57 yo F with metastatic non-small cell lung CA and leptomeningeal disease s/p ommaya placement on [**2196-11-11**] s/p cycle 6 Pemetrexed completed [**11-30**], admitted [**Date range (1) 38706**] for staph meningitis treated with ~10 days of vancomycin and removal of ommaya, presenting to clinic [**12-2**] with fever 101/neck pain/HA, admitted for suspected recurrent meningitis.
#Suspected Meningitis: recent history of coag negative staph meningitis treatment with IV vancomycin, presenting with F/neck pain concerning for recurrent meningitis.
-LP: f/u cytology -started Dexamethasone 4mg [**Hospital1 **] (cleared by neuro-onc) particularly given MRI brain with increased size and number of lesions and enhancement significant for leptomeningeal disease.
-f/u neurosurgery recs- they are aware of bulding frontal area and new neuro sxs.
-ID following: continue current regimen for now -pain control with home dose of oxycodone, IV dilaudid for severe pain was increased this morning .
#h/o seizure:  On previous admission, developed aphasia and right sided facial droop that self-resolved and was determined to be acute focal seizure.
Was initiated on keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
-continue keppra .
MRI on [**2196-11-30**] shows progression of disease including lesions concerning for leptomeningeal disease.
Cytology from CSF on [**11-28**] also consistent with leptomeningeal disease.
# anemia: Guiaic neg overnight - iron, B12, folate, hemolysis labs: high ferritin and high haptoglobin, other labs normal .
SHe had high opening pressures, but no frank pus or infection was noted.
Post operatively her CT dmonstrated good placement and no hemorrhage.
Overnight on [**12-5**] she was being transferred to another stretcher and her EVD became disconnected at the distal portion and was immediately clamoped and then reconnected.
On [**12-7**] she was slightly confused but doing well.
This did result in brief cessation of fluid from drain site but it again picked up overnight and into the morning of [**12-11**].
A CT head was obtained and showed stable ventricular size and no subdural hematoma and her drain was lowered to 5cm above the tragus.
On the morning of [**12-12**], she had persistent draininage from her EVD insertion.
A purse-string suture was placed to prevent further drainage.
It was removed without difficulty.
In the afternoon she began to have mild CSF drainage from her old incision.
She continued to have drainage from her old scalp incision.
On [**12-15**] she went to the OR for placement of a right sided Ommaya reservoir and a Left sided VP shunt.
On [**12-17**] she had a brief episode of complete aphasia.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable [**Name (NI) 2729**], you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
