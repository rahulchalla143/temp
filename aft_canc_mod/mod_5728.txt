Patient has a history of variceal bleed s/p banding about 8 months ago; this is also the time he stopped drinking.
He was recently diagnosed with a right liver lobe mass seen on CT in [**2154-10-15**]; follow up MRI showed a 3.2 cm X 3.2 cm mass consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma.
His cirrhosis has also been previously complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and prior episodes of renal insufficiency.
In recent weeks he was noted to have increased fluid retention, says he gained ~ 40lb in two months, a week prior to the current admission he had theraputic paracentesis with 5 L taken off.
EGD was performed which was negative for active bleeding and showed decompressed varicies, nodules c/w mets.
In the MICU, patient was afebrile and w/o abdominal or GI complaints, but was noted to have leukocytosis to 28, He had paracentesis with peritoneal fluid showing less than 250 PMN's but gram stain positive for GNRs, Glucose wasn't measured.
CXR didn't show pneumonia and UA was neg.
He denies any abdominal pain, denies N/V.
Denies any recent fevers or chills.
Denies urinary symptoms or any other complaints.
Decompensated cirrhosis 2.
History of variceal bleeding s/p banding 4.
Renal insufficiency.
Family History: No known family history of liver disease or liver cancer.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM Vitals: HR 92, BP 118/62, SpO2 98% 2L, temp 98, RR 14 Gen: Dark-skinned male, pleasant, in no apparent distress Cardiac: Nl s1/S2, RRR, murmur loudest in aortic area Pulm: lungs clear bilaterally Abd: distended but soft abdomen, not tense, nontender Ext: 2+ lower extremity edema noted Neuro: mild asterixis, oriented X 3  DISCHARGE EXAM Vitals:  96.8 119/60 78 100%RA Gen: Pleasant man in NAD HEENT: MMM, OP clear Cardiac: RRR, 2/6 systolic murmur.
Imaging this admission: CXR [**2155-1-24**] Lung volumes are lower, there has been genuine increase in mild cardiomegaly, mediastinal and pulmonary vascular engorgement suggesting cardiac decompensation.
It is hard to say whether mild edema is present at the lung bases, but there are no equivocal findings of that.
Small left pleural effusion may have developed.
No pneumothorax.
EGD [**2155-1-24**] Nodule in the lower third of the esophagus No evidence of varices, active bleeding or ulcerations Mosaic appearance in the fundus and stomach body compatible with Mild bleeding portal gastropathy Polyps in the antrum No evidence of polyps, varices or masses Normal mucosa in the first part of the duodenum and second part of the duodenum No evidence of polyps, masses or active bleeding Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum .

# Anemia - Initially admitted to the ICU with hematocrit of 19.
An EGD showed mild bleeding gastropathy, likely source of melena and blood loss.
# SBP:  Not initilly treated as did not meet criteria based on ascitic WBC alone.
This infection may have been the inciting event for for his GI bleed.
It was likely the source of leukcytosis which improved over the course of the admission.
# Ascites:  Held diuretics in setting of GIB, which were subsequently restarted at the time of discharge.
The importance of a low sodium diet was again stressed to the patient.
He did not have tense ascites, or respiratory compromise, and in the setting of renal failure and SBP a therapeutic paracentesis was subsequently not performed.
# Acute on Chronic kidney disease:  The patient's recent baseline was ~1.9.
# Alcoholic Cirrhosis - complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, varices, ascites, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
# Asymptomatic bacteruria:  Urine cultures grew several strains of VRE.
These cultures were associated with a negative UA, grew in low colony counts, and when coupled with the fact the patient was asymptomatic, was felt most likely to represent colonization, and the patient was not treated.
-Close follow-up with hepatology for consideration of liver transplant is planned -Ciprofloxacin started for SBP prophylaxis.
PO twice a day: No generics.

You had a low blood count, and maroon colored stool which suggested bleeding in your intestines.
