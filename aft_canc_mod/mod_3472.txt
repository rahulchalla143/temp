Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 20179**] is a 58 year-old male with a history of stage IV non-small cell lung CA with mets to adrenals who presents with shortness of breath with fever, left shift w/ bands, and new O2 requirement.
Plan: # SOB/Hypoxia:Patient on 2L home O2 with increasing requirement over last day.
Patient with fever in the ED in absence of cough or sputum production.
CXR demonstrating worsening opacity of the right lung concerning for post-obstructive pneumonia vs. hemorrhage (Hct has dropped 35-->28 but in setting of chemo 10 days ago) vs. edema/effusion, though no other evidence systemically vs. disease progression, unclear if this would also be causing fever, lactate rise.
Initially started on vancomycin for concerns for possible pnuemonia, however no evidence clinically to suggest infection here in the ICU.
Team felt that likely source of worsening oxygen requirement was progression of disease so antibiotics were discontinued.
# Anion Gap metabolic acidosis: In setting of lactate of 6.
No hyperglycemia, no ingestions, no uremia, no meds.
# Hypophosphatemia: Patient with recurrent hypophos since [**9-25**] presumed to be related to rapid correction of hypercalcemia with  pamidronate resulting in deposition of calcium and phosphate - continue agressive IV/po phosphate repletion .
# Right Back/Shoulder Pain: Chronic, seen by palliative care for pain control.
# Pancytopenia/ONC: Since last chemo on [**10-29**], HCT drop 35-->28, Plts 200-107, WBC 22--5.
# hyperlipidemia: Continue statin .
# hypertension: borderline hypotension on admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] - holding home ACE in this setting, will re-start when stable .
# CAD/mild diastolic heart dysfunction: H/o VT post-MI on acebutolol.
No evidence of ischemia on history, EKG.
No volume overload on exam.
# depression/anxiety: Clearly struggling with anxiety at home.
- continue citalopram - trial of haldol for anxiety/agitation, prn ativan if patient not responsive He was transferred to the oncology service, where he continued to be short of breath with minimal exertion.
