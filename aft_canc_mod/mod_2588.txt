There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2183-10-22**], a small-to-moderate pericardial effusion is now present.
There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions and associated lower lobe atelectasis.
Separate from this, there are patchy areas of opacities in the lower lobes as well as the left upper lobe, lingula, and right upper lobe.
No pulmonary edema is identified.
Patchy multifocal opacities consistent with pneumonia.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
Small amount of pericardial fluid and ascites.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2184-4-16**] 11:11 AM FINDINGS: Diffuse lung parenchymal abnormalities have progressed, including areas of consolidation, ground-glass attenuation, and poorly defined nodules.
The areas of consolidation have a striking subpleural distribution except for at the lung bases where they are combined bronchovascular and subpleural in distribution.
Areas of ground-glass attenuation are more variable in distribution, and poorly defined nodules are predominantly peribronchovascular.
Within the lower lungs, there is also smoothly marginated septal thickening present.
A small amount of retained secretions are present within the central airways, but there are no suspicious lesions.
Numerous mediastinal lymph nodes are again demonstrated with slight increase in size.
For example, a right paratracheal lymph node at the level of the aortic arch is now 13 mm compared to 10 mm, and a lower right paratracheal lymph node at the level of the carina now measures 16 mm in short axis and previously measured 15 mm.
Bilateral hilar nodes appear similar allowing for difficulty in measurement due to absence of intravenous contrast.
Moderate-sized dependent posterior pericardial effusion has slightly increased, and small dependent pleural effusions have minimally decreased on the right and minimally increased on the left.
Examination is not specifically tailored to evaluate the subdiaphragmatic region, but a small incompletely imaged cyst in the right lobe of the liver is incidentally noted as well as diffuse increased attenuation of the liver.
Please note that absence of intravenous and oral contrast reduced sensitivity of CT for detecting abdominal abnormalities.
Subcutaneous 17-mm diameter round lesion in the upper right posterior chest wall appears unchanged.
There are no acute skeletal abnormalities.
Incidental note is made of an apparent hemangioma in the lower thoracic spine as well as an area of disc calcification.
Worsening of widespread lung parenchymal abnormalities, with combined subpleural and peribronchovascular distributions.
The differential diagnosis is broad, but cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is a likely contributing diagnosis.
However, the severity of abnormalities in the lower lungs and the presence of associated septal thickening raise the concern for a secondary, coexisting process such as atypical infection or edema.
No change in subcutaneous soft tissue nodule in upper right chest wall.
This could potentially represent a sebaceous cyst, but correlation with physical exam findings is suggested for initial further assessment if the diagnosis is not already known clinically.
Improvement of the widespread lung parenchymal abnormalities including ground-glass opacities, peribronchovascular infiltrates, and subpleural consolidation.
The left pleural effusion has completely resolved while the right pleural effusion has persisted.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2184-5-4**] 10:39 PM FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or acute vascular territorial infarction.
There is no fracture.
There is mild mucosal thickening in the bilateral maxillary sinuses.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Please note that MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is more sensitive for the detection of acute brain ischemia.
MR/A HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2184-5-5**] 4:17 PM FINDINGS: There is no hemorrhage, infarct, or edema.
No abnormal signal intensity within the brain parenchyma.
There is no abnormal enhancement.
Increased signal on the post-contrast images (series16, im 14)in the internal auditory canals can be real or due to 3T scanner effect as this is not identifiable on post contrast MRA neck images.
MRA OF THE BRAIN: The intracranial vertebral and internal carotid arteries and their major branches are normal with no evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm.
No stenosis or occlusion identified.
No acute infarction.
Increased signal on post contrast images of brain in the internal auditory canals can be real or artifactual related to 3T scanner effect amd is not associated with increased FLAIR signal or seen on postcontrast MRA neck images.
No focal flow limiting stenosis, occlusion or aneurysm more than 3mm within the resolution of MRA.
Well-defined nodule in the subcutaneous tissues of the parietal vertex, which may represent a sebaceous cyst, lymph node, or nodule of uncertain etiology.
PERSANTINE MIBI  [**2184-5-7**] INTERPRETATION: Left ventricular cavity size is mildly dilated.
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the left ventricular myocardium.
Mildly dilated left ventricular cavity size.
HEART RATE:  80 BLOOD PRESSURE:  118/64  PROTOCOL  / STAGE TIME SPEED ELEVATION [**Doctor Last Name 10502**] HEART BLOOD RPP   (MIN) (MPH) (%)   RATE PRESSURE 1 0-4 0.142MG/ KG/MIN   90 98/60 8820  TOTAL EXERCISE TIME:  4 % MAX HRT RATE ACHIEVED:  54  SYMPTOMS: NONE ST DEPRESSION: NONE INTERPRETATION: This 53 year old man was referred to the lab for  evaluation of chest pain.
No arm, neck, back or chest discomfort was reported by the patient throughout the study.
There were no ST segment changes during the infusion or in recovery.
The rhythm was sinus with no ectopy.
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes.
Brief Hospital Course: 53 yo male with history of AML, s/p cord blood transplant who presented in early [**Month (only) 958**] with ARDS of unclear etiology requiring intubation.
Floor course was complicated by increasing hypoxia so he was readmitted to the ICU for increasing respiratory distress/ARDS, found to have BOOP, treated with high dose steroids after which he made steady improvements and continued to make progress on the floor.
Hospital course by problem:  # ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME: Upon admission, the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotic treatment in order to treat an infectious process responsible for a clinical picture consistent with ARDS.
There was some concern that the ARDS was secondary to rare cyclosporine toxicity, which had been intiated 3 days prior to presentation, however this was later felt not to be the case.
The patient was noted to have pleural effusions and gross body volume overload in the setting of ARF with an elevated BNP upon admission, but was an unlikely primary source of patients respiratory decompenstation.
He was volume overloaded on transfer and diuresis was continued with 100mg IV lasix daily.
No ECG changes during event.
Over the course of the next few days, he remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint with a requirement of 6L NC.
On [**4-9**], the patient transiently desaturated to 90% on 6L with mild shortness of breath.
He was afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
CT chest revealed increased diffuse bilateral peribronchovascular infiltrates as compared to previous.
His oxygenation status continued to deteriorate and he desatted frequently to the 70-80s on 6L with only minimal exertion.
TTE on [**4-12**] revealed a normal EF with mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior segments of the LV, which had been seen on a prior TTE on [**4-2**].
On the morning of [**4-13**], the patient became hypoxic to 86% and required NRB to maintain sats in the low-mid 90s.
The etiology of his respiratory distress was unclear with the differential including BOOP, ILD, and CHF.
Pt was transferred back to the ICU for repeated desaturations on RA to the low 80s, with the concern for either a cardiogenic or pulmonary process.
LAD calcifications were noted on Chest CT, suggesting coronary artery disease.
CT chest revealed likely BOOP, and pt was started on methylprednisolone IV with planned slow taper.
# Coronary artery disease: The patient had an episode of nausea/diaphoresis in ICU and was evaluated with EKG that showed non-specific changes.
Cardiology felt impression most consistent with angina and recommended continuation of aspirin and beta-blocker.
Further decreased in setting of transient facial numbness/weakness on [**5-4**] and improved since then.
P-MIBI on [**5-7**] showed no ECG changes, and normal myocardial perfusion on scintigraphy, mildly dilated left ventricular cavity size with mild depression of systolic function (LVEF 49%).
#Facial Weakness/numbness and Altered Mental Status: Patient had a transient episode of facial weakness and numbness with AMS on [**5-4**].
Most likely was due to poor perfusion in setting of relative hypotension (SBP upper 90's).
He had no further episodes.
While intubated, the patient developed persistent fevers.
His Hickman line site showed no evidence of infection.
Lower extremity ultra-sound showed no evidence of DVT, and CT of chest showed a question of a multifocal pneumonia.
# H/O LEUKEMIA, ACUTE s/p cord blood transplantation for AML.
Concern that ARDS was secondary to GVH prophylactic medation cyclosporine.
# RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE: The patient presented with ARF, and over intial days had a rising Cr to a peak of 3.0 with oliguric renal production.
Renal was consulted, who felt that ARF was seondary to cyclosporine toxicity, as patient was admitted with supratherapeutic levels of near 400.
He was grossly fluid overloaded due to aggressive fluid hydration with oliguria, and has required diuresis to help mobilize fluid.
# h/o ASPERGILLUS INFECTION: The patient has a history of sinus aspergillosis, on Voriconazole home regimen.
Pt developed new fevers & Head CT on [**3-26**] reported L sphenoid sinusitis, d/w ENT, very subtle & nothing to drain, performed nasal washing & sent aspirate for fungal culture to r/o fungal infections.
PROPHYLAXIS pneumoboots/ambulation for DVT prophylaxis, PPI given high dose steroids, Atovaquone, acyclovir, voriconazole .
Pt has acquired healing stage II pressure ulcers while inpatient secondary to friction and sheer.
There are small and circular in size, pink wound bed with surrounding skin intact.
There is no drainage or odor to these wounds.

Hypoxic respiratory failure due to ARDS and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia 3.
Diabetes secondary to steroids 4.
Atypical chest pain 5.
Mild chronic systolic heart dysfunction 6.
ICU neuropathy and myopathy 7. transient facial weakness of unknown etiology 8. coronary artery disease   Discharge Condition: VSS, on 1LO2, breathing comfortably, lungs clear, ambulates with assistance   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with respiratory failure thought due to ARDS/BOOP.
You were also noted to have chest pain with deep breaths.
You had a stress test which was negative for ischemic changes or perfusion defects.
You had an echocardiogram which showed mildly depressed ejection fraction (50%) which indicates you have mild chronic systolic heart dysfunction.
While you were in the ICU you developed lower extremity weakness and tingling.
This likely was exacerbated by steroids, but could suggest underlying insulin resistance.
If you develop fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, bleeding, light headedness, mental status changes, or any other concerning symptoms, please call your doctor or come to the hospital.
