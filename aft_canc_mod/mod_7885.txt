MRI brain without gadolinium wiht moderate atrophy and mild periventricular hyperintensities and hydrocephalus.
She was placed on 15 days of IV ganciclovir for meningoencephalitis with positive EBV PCR in CSF.
A repeat head MRI without gadolinium showed 3 hyperintense FLAIR lesions in the left caudate, right parietal periventricular region, and left frontal region near the surface of the brain.
She still has short-term memory problems and psychomotor slowing.

There is no FDG avid disease outside the brain.
MRI: IMPRESSION: Limited study, performed without contrast enhancement, due to the patient's significant renal insufficiency, with: 1.
Normal spinal cord caliber and intrinsic signal intensity, through the level of the conus medullaris.
No discrete epidural or paraspinal soft tissue mass.
Normal vertebral height and alignment, with heterogeneous intrinsic signal intensity, which may represent red marrow reconversion and/or response to chemotherapy, but should be correlated clinically.
There is no focal STIR-signal abnormality to specifically suggest marrow replacement.
Labs at discharge:  Lumbar Puncture:  Many lymphocytes with rare atypical forms and monocytes present.
(2) Encephalopathy:  Some of her neurological impairment was thought to be due to residual effects of EBV meningoencephalitis, but outpatient note suggested more likely to be lymphoma effects.
Dr.[**Name (NI) 94547**] outpatient note suggests prominent features are memory impairment and emotional lability.
