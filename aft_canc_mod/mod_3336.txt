Intra-abdominal drain placement, then removal on [**2193-2-22**]   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 63-year-old female with past medical history significant for  atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, asthma, hypertension, diet-controlled type II diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction with PCI (RCA stent in [**2192-5-17**]), status-post CABG x1 ([**2192-7-31**])and a history of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia with allogenic bone marrow transplant done [**3-/2191**], on regular low dose steroids for GVHD of the skin s/p BMT, who presented on [**2193-1-19**] complaining of [**1-18**] days of "crampy" lower abdominal pains.
The pain was acute in onset over a 1 day period.
No accompanying nausea or emesis, and she also denied any pain with urination.
Other pertinent GI related conditions include her history of abdominal pains and diarrhea which eventually led to the discovery of C.difficile colitis back in [**2191-3-17**].
She states she had a recurrence of her C.difficile again in [**5-/2191**] but was then effectively treated and her symptoms had completely resolved.
Due to her severe abdominal cramping and pains, she was initially observed in the ICU setting with the intention to manage her conservatively with medications and supportive therapy as she was felt to be a poor surgical candidate given her previous cancer and cardiac history and being on ASA and Plavix on admission.

Since the previous tracing of [**2193-1-22**] atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is no longer seen.
Small pelvic free fluid also tracking up along the right paracolic gutter.
Extensive colonic diverticulosis, with mild stranding surrounding a loop of sigmoid colon in the left lower quadrant suggesting sigmoid diverticulitis as possible source for perforation.
Atherosclerotic disease.
There is no free air under the diaphragm.
There is stable deformity of one of the right ribs, likely related to old trauma or surgical intervention.
CONCLUSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Intraperitoneal air remains, possibly with slight increase vs redistribution.
Minimal retrocardiac opacity c/w atelectasis however minimal infectious vs inflammatory process cannot be excluded.
[**2193-1-24**] CT ABD/PELVIS W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: Visualized portions of the lung bases are unchanged from the previous study.
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
Coronary arterial calcification is also noted.
A small amount of free-fluid is also seen, predominantly in a perihepatic location as well as a second collection at the base of the mesentery (2:49).
Atherosclerotic calcification is noted along the abdominal aorta and its arterial branches and note is also made of aortic ectasia.
Scattered mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are visualized, none of which meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
The previously described area of thickening along the sigmoid colon in the area of known diverticulosis is again visualized, and there is also extraluminal leak of oral contrast.
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
No suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesions.
Pneumoperitoneum, larger since [**1-19**] as well as extraluminal leak of oral contrast, collecting near the sigmoid colon.
Overall, these findings are concerning for a perforated sigmoid diverticulum.

#Abdominal Pain:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted for lower quadrant crampy abdominal pains.
The patient was considered a high-risk operative candidate due to her cardiac and cancer history, and her pain was focal and isolated to her right lower quadrent, and thus initially received conservative treatment.
CT of abdomen/pelvis at time of admission had showed small amount of pneumoperitoneum anteriorly and also around the liver.
Small pelvic free fluid also tracking up along the right paracolic gutter.
Extensive colonic diverticulosis, with mild stranding surrounding a loop of sigmoid colon in the left lower quadrant suggesting sigmoid diverticulitis as possible source for perforation.
Though she initially responded quite well to the IV antibiotics with significant improvement in her abdominal pain for the first [**2-19**] days, he patient's abdominal pain & overall appearance worsened on hospital day #4, and it was clear that she needed to be taken to the operating room for a exploratory laparotomy.
the surgical team found a thickened indurated colon but no masses.
There was an extensive area of inflammatory changes with a small area of focal perforation along sigmoid colon.
There was contained stool in the pelvis.
She underwent surgery for a perforated diverticulum including a sigmoidectomy, hartmann?????
?s pouch, and colostomy with a plan for anastamosis in the future.
Her operative course was relatively uncomplicated, she did have some intra-op bleeding which was managed with cautery and FFP.
Her post-op course was later complicated by fever after being taken off Zosyn (her zosyn was continued post operatively for PNA treatment).
On CT of the abdomen she was found to have loculated fluid collections which required post-operative IR drainage and a JP drain was left in place.
A repeat CT was done on [**2193-2-21**] to assess interval changes and it appeared that there was continued decrease in size of the left flank and pelvic collections, Hartmann pouch showed no evidence of leak, and she also had complete resolution of bilateral mild hydronephrosis.
She had no signs of fevers, abdominal pains, leukocytosis or discomfort for several days leading up to her discharge date.
A repeat CT was set-up a few days prior to this appointment to allow for final review for any recurrent abscesses or collections prior to final removal of PICC and antibiotic discontinuance.
# History of AML: The patient's hematologic/oncology history dates back to fall [**2190**] after routine labs indicated persistent pancytopenia.
She had an initial bone marrow biopsy with myelodysplasia with no cytogenetic abnormalities and additional workup that was most consistent with MDS.
A repeat bone marrow biopsy showed acute erythroleukemia and she was diagnosed with AML.
She had additional note of subsequent mild GVHD, predominantly over her skin and mouth.
# Anemia: The patient developed anemia while in the hospital but it remained stable.
Iron studies showed that she was not iron deficient.
She tolerated these very well with no significant reactions of note.
Hematocrit at admission was 43 and she had nadir to 25-27 range and by time of discharge her hematocrit was back to 31-33 range consistently and she had no signs of any active bleeding.
# Hypoxia: Post operatively Mrs. [**Known lastname **] became hypoxic with an oxygen requirement.
She was found to have a positive RSV respiratory study [**2193-1-22**].
A CT from [**2193-1-30**] showed new focal opacities in the RUL.
She also had diffuse acute dilatation of the airways with mucoid impaction and bronchial wall thickening bilaterally.
She had slightly increased pleural effusions and her ground-glass opacity has mostly resolved.
Her oxygen requirement resolved on [**2193-1-31**].
Given her PMH of mild asthma she was discharged to continue her usual home albuterol inhaler on an as-needed basis and to notify her doctor if she had any additional fevers, productive cough or recurrent dyspnea.
# Coronary Artery Disease:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] had history of CAD with prior inferior STEMI in [**5-/2192**] for which she underwent RCA stenting, and later had an endoscopic CABG x1.
#Hypertension: Metoprolol dose was decreased to metoprolol tartrate 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] as her blood pressure well controlled on this regimen and she was bradycardic at night when on a higher dose.
# Atrial fibrillation: Mrs.[**Initials (NamePattern4) 24712**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 34306**] and post-operative course were complicated by atrial fibrillation.
Before her laparotomy, she was evaluated by cardiology and her coumadin therapy she had been taking for her known atrial fibrillation was discontinued for the procedure.
She had some rapid bouts of atrial fibrillation on [**2193-1-22**] which required a diltiazem drip for control.
with no significant cardiac events.
# Hypotension: She experienced hypotension preoperatively that required fluid boluses.
She also experienced hypotension post operatively that was asymptomatic.
Post operatively her hypotensive episodes were attributed to the combination of getting metoprolol and lasix per the surgical service notes.
# Edema: The patient had extensive lower extremity edema and less prominent upper extremity edema post-operatively.
She ws seen by the physical therapy team and was able to ambulate and do some minimal exercises which markedly helped with her conditioning and edema collections.
# GERD: She has a history of gastroesophageal reflux and she was continued on her usual famotidine medication for GI protection and relief during her stay.
# Diabetes Mellitus Type II: ??????Mrs.
She had well controlled fasting and prandial fingersticks which required minimal to no SSI coverage.
# Insomnia: She had some mild complaints of occasional insomnia during her hospital course which was effectively relieved with lorazepam 0.5 mg PO HS:PRN.
Nutrition helped with initial electrolyte balance and she was repleted as needed during her stay with close daily monitoring of all of her electrolytes.
# Elevated LFTs: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] had some transaminitis noted during her hospital course  which was thought to be secondary to her antibiotics.
Once she was tapered down to just Zosyn she seemed to have a resolution of these abnormal labs.
Oxycodone 5 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO every six (6) hours as needed for pain for 15 doses: Please note that this medication makes you drowsy, please don't drive ot operate skilled machinery while taking this medication.
Secondary: - Coronary Artery Disease (prior STEMI in [**2192-5-17**], PCI/stenting to RCA) - Endoscopic CABG  ([**2192-7-31**]) - history of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia, (s/p chemotherapy, radiation and bone marrow transplantation [**3-/2191**]) - Hypertension - Hypercholesterolemia - GERD - Type II Diabetes Mellitus - diet controlled - Diverticulosis, noted on colonoscopy 4 years ago - Occasional bronchospasm treated with Primatene Mist - History of SVC clot [**2191**] [**2-18**] PORT (s/p course of lovenox) - History of C.Difficile ([**3-23**] & [**5-23**]) - History of VRE - History of Shingles - History of Asthma   Discharge Condition: Good.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you had a perforated diverticulum.
You required blood and blood products during your hospitalization for anemia and low blood counts.
You went into an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation but you were converted back to a normal rhythm with a medication called amiodarone.
You also had a pneumonia, respiratory virus, and a later abdominal abscess and you were treated with an antibiotic called Zosyn.
When you had some respiratory infections you had some additional shortness of breath which was relieved with supplemental oxygen, but you were gradually taken off of this once you were no longer short of breath.
You have been given an additional prescripyion for pain medication if you have abdominal pain.
Please call your doctor or return to the ER if you have abdominal pains, diarrhea, bloody stool or discolored stool in your colostomy, new chest pain, chest pressure, chest tightness, cough , wheezing, vomiting, fevers, chills or any new concerning symptoms.
-Please call the doctor if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision sites, colostomy site or JP drain entry site.
