Stool Cx [**4-25**] and [**4-26**]: NEGATIVE =================== Imaging: [**4-21**] CT non-contrast abdomen and pelvis: Mild acute diverticulitis of the proximal sigmoid colon with no evidence of perforation or surrounding collection.
Exophytic lesion arising off the lower pole of the right kidney which is incompletely evaluated; neoplasm cannot be excluded.
Suggest further evaluation with a triphasic CT scan or MRI for further characterization.
Calcified left pelvic side wall node and two surgical clips which is concerning for prostate cancer recurrence.
[**4-23**] CT non-contrast abdomen and pelvis: Mural thickening at descending/signoid colon junction, with associated diverticulae and pericolic fat stranding, mildly progressed from prior study.
A follow-up colonoscopy to exclude neoplasm is recommended.
Bilateral renal lesions are indeterminate and can be further evaluated with ultrasound.
Two non-specific tiny pulmonary nodules could be followed up with chest CT in six months.
[**4-23**] RUQ U/S: Notable for 2 cm mildly hypoechoic lesion along the right hepatic dome, with suggestion of vascularity seen on color Doppler imaging, does not have son[**Name (NI) 493**] features of a simple cyst or hemangioma and is concerning for metastasis.
[**4-26**] Liver Spleen sulfur colloid scan: No focal liver abnormalities identified within the limits of resolution of liver/spleen scan.
Absence of focal defect favors focal nodular hyperplasia for the lesion seen on prior ultrasound.
Small ill-defined hepatic hypodensities.
Acute uncomplicated sigmoid diverticulitis.
[**5-4**] CT w/contrast abdomen and pelvis: Interval progression of portal venous clot into the left portal vein.
Interval resolution of multiple hepatic microabscesses.
Persistent thickening of the sigmoid colon likely represents resolving diverticulitis.
POLYMICROBIAL BACTEREMIA/ACUTE DIVERTICULITIS/LIVER MICROABSCESSES: Patient determined to have polymicrobial bacteremia--E.Coli, bacteroides fragilis and clostridium.
This was felt to be secondary to acute diverticultitis given thickening of the rectosigmoid colon and mild mesenteric stranding seen on CT.
On [**4-29**] he underwent repeat Abd CT given intermittent low grade temps to 100.4 and was found to have multiple liver microabscesses and a new portal vein thrombosis.
He was afebrile for >72 hrs at time of discharge.
CT scan on [**4-29**] demonstrated portal vein thrombosis involving the right anterior and posterior divisions and extending into the main portal vein.
The patient has a history of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] MPD associated with JAK2 V617F mutation making him more susceptible to splanchnic and portal vein thrombosis.
It was felt that this underlying susceptibility in the setting of bacteremia contributed to thrombosis.
He was started on heparin gtt (given renal failure and recent GI bleed) bridge to coumadin.
Because of his underlying MPD, he will likely require lifelong anticoagulation.
# LOWER GI BLEED: Etiology unclear.
Possible sources thought to be diverticulitis, ischemia or malignancy.
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  Likely pre-renal from sepsis and hyperglycemia induced osmotic diuresis.
# LIVER LESION: A 2 cm mildly hypoechoic lesion along the right hepatic dome noted on abdominal ultrasound.
Patient underwent liver spleen sulfur colloid scan which showed no focal liver abnormalities suggesting this lesion represents focal nodular hyperplasia.
Given initial concern this could represent a malignancy CEA, AFP and Ca19-9 checked: CEA was mildly elevated at 8.0, AFP wnl at 1.8, Ca19-9 wnl at 33. .
# ENLARGED PELVIC NODULE: Seen on ABD CT [**4-23**] and described as 1.8 short axis soft tissue nodule in the left pelvic side wall.
Given history of prostate cancer a PSA was checked and found to be undetectable.
He has follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] who follow him for his myeloproliferative condition and history of prostate cancer respectively.
It is recommended that patient have a renal ultrasound to further evaluate.
# PULMONARY NODULES: Seen on CT ABD [**4-23**] and described as two tiny non-specific pulmonary nodules.
This was in the setting of elevated blood sugars and what was likely autodiuresis in setting of recovering renal function.
# Non-Caseating Granulomatous Disease of Unclear Etiology: Prior to admission patient had uptitrated prednisone to 50mg daily given he was attributing his symptoms of fever, chills, abd pain and malaise to this condition.
His hydroxyurea was held in the setting of infection and anemia.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Home solutions  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Escheria Coli and Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium Bacteremia, Lower gastrointestinal bleeding, Diverticulitis, Acute on chronic renal failure, Hyperglycemia, Hyponatremia .
SECONDARY: Granulomatous auto-immune disease, polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], type two diabetes mellitus, history of prostate cancer, history of benign pancreatic lesion   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Blood test showed a bacterial infection in your blood (bacteremia) and you were treated with antibiotics.
During the course of your hospitalization you were found to have blood in your stools.
Because of this we did a repeat CT scan of your abdomen on [**2157-4-29**] which showed small abscesses in your liver and a clot in the portal vein to the liver.
We also started you on blood "thinner" medications (heparin and coumadin) and monitored your blood levels until the activity of coumadin was therapeutic for two days (goal INR = 2.0 - 3.0).
On the day prior to discharge we obtained a repeat abdominal CT scan to assess intereval changes in the liver micro-abscesses and portal vein clot.
This scan demonstrated decreased size of the abscesses but increased size of the portal vein clot.
