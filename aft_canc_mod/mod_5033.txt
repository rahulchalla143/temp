Admission Date:  [**2151-6-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-7-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2095-3-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: SOB Transfer for Management of Tamponade  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericadriocentesis with Drain Placement ([**6-13**]) Pericardial window procedure with drain ([**6-15**]) Right femoral central venous line ([**6-26**])   History of Present Illness:    56yo F with hx of metastatic ovarian CA s/p pericardial effusion drained on [**5-19**] is transferred for recurrence of pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
The pt initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] with shortness of breath.
ECHO at OSH demonstrated tamponade physiology with RV collapse.
At 5:00 pm, underwent multiple sub-xyphoid punctures - 240 cc of bloody fluid drained.
Pt was scheduled to see CT surgery for a window as an outpt but develop symptoms prior to appointment.
Patient denied fevers, chills, N/V, or chest pain.
When she had a pericardial effusion several weeks ago, developed shortness of breath as weel, was relieved with drainage of the effusion.
Had 400 + ccs of bloody fluid drained.
Shortness of breath has been slowly worsening since her last tap.
Ovarian CA metastatic to lungs originally diagnosed in '[**37**] at which time the pt underwent TAH with recurrence in '[**45**]: ---s/p hysterectomy in '[**37**] ---s/p chemo with multiple regimens in past.
---hx of recurrent right pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis and talc sclerosis therapy, plurex catheter placement on 6L chronic home O2.
---hx of recurrent pericardial effusion with tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis on [**2151-5-19**], [**2151-6-13**].
HTN 3.
Hypothyroidism 4.
Skin graft to left lower extremity due to opening of wound of unclear reasons 5.  s/p LLE fracture in '[**42**]   Social History: Used to smoke 1 PPD but quit in [**2125**].
Conversing in short sentences.
HEENT: PERRLA, EOMI, anicteric, no exophthalamus NECK: JVD appreciated to angle of mandible at 60 to 70 degrees.
Drain in place with mild tenderness to palpation.
ABD: dressing over umbilicus, distended, soft, NT, ND, BS+ EXT: wwp, 3+ edema bilaterally, LLE with erythema and warmth.
No drainage from wound itself (although pt reports clear drainage).
Upon Admission to MICU [**6-26**]: VS - T98.3, BP 117/88, HR 118, O2 95% 6L General - sedated, barely arousable female in NAD, breathing heavily; awakes to loud voice and follows commands only after repeated stimulation HEENT - pupils small and minimally reactive, patient not opening mouth Neck - enlarged area of left parotid with surrounding erythema CV - 2-3/6 holosystolic murmur loudest at apex.
Chest - mild wheezes, no crackles anterially (patient will not sit up for exam) Abdomen - distended, multiple firms masses bilaterally, +BS, +wound from recent pericardial drain around epigastric area, dressing c/d/i; + ascities Ext - 1+ pitting edema bilaterally, wound bandaged on LLE.
Pertinent Results: STUDIES: EKG: sinus tachycardia at 112 bpm, LAD, TWF in I, inversion in aVL, ?
low voltage II, poor R wave progression .
[**2151-6-4**] ECHO: LV hyperdynamic systolic function, EF 75-80%, left strium - normal, right strium - normal, aortic root - noral, pericardium - moderate sized pericardial effusion with organized material on the visceral pericardium, consistent with thrombus or tumor, aortic valve - thickened, mitral valve - thickened, tricuspid/pulmonic valves - normal, trace TR .
Severe parotitis without a focal sialolith.
Etiology may be infectious, related to chemotherapy, or idiopathic in nature.
Several lymph nodes are seen in the region of the enlarged left parotid gland, some of which may be reactive in nature.
Extensive lymphadenopathy seen throughout the neck and superior mediastinum as well as the right axilla.
Many of these lymph nodes are calcified and may relate to psammomatous calcification given history of ovarian cancer.
Soft tissue nodules in the right anterior chest and upper right back are also likely metastatic in nature.
Diffuse lung metastases and probable metastatic lesions within the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 56 year old female with metastatic ovarian cancer with history of recurrent pericardial effusions causing tamponade originally admitted [**2151-6-13**] for SOB [**1-28**] tamponade, treated with pericardiocentisis then pericardial window on [**2151-6-15**].
Pt then developed severe right side parotiditis with sepsis and was transferred to the MICU on [**2151-6-26**].
Shortly after her admission to the MICU, the patient became diaphoretic and developed acute respiratory address (RR 30's, O2 sats 80s), and was intubated due to increased work of breathing.
She subsequently became hypotensive (MAP 50s), with cool, mottled appearing lower extremities.
The etiology of her acute decompensation was felt likely to be sepsis caused by transient bacteremia seeded from the partoiditis.
# SEPSIS: The most likely etiology was felt to be transient bacteremia from parotiditis.
However, evaluation for other sources of infection included CXR, cultures of blood, urine, sputum, stool for c. diff, and parotid gland.
RUQ and abdominal ultrasound were unremarkable for hydronephrosis, cholecystitis and ascites (small amount, insufficient to tap).
- cardiac enzymes unremarkable.
# RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Felt likely [**1-28**] sepsis induced acidemia in the setting of poor pulmonary reserve (multiple metastatic pulmonary nodules).
Pt seen by ENT and felt that parotiditis was not likely to cause airway compromise.
Pt on 6L home O2 for chronic lung disease felt likely [**1-28**] metastatic lung disease and treatment.
- concern regarding further swelling of neck resulting in respiratory obstruction felt unlikely by ENT.
pt also at risk for osteomyelitis of adjacent facial bone.
Other casues include post-renal obstruction (ureter mets from ovarian ca), however abdominal usn was negative for hydronephrosis.
# UGI BLEEDING: Dark, maroon colored aspirate noted from NGT overnight [**6-26**] during episode of acute respiratory failure and hypotension.
# CARDIAC TAMPONADE: Pt is s/p repeat pericardiocentesis [**6-13**] (240cc) for recurrent malignant pericardial effusions casusing tamponade, and pericardial window procedure [**6-15**] (with removal of an infected port-a-cath device) with placement of a chest tube for ongoing drainage of ascites fluid [**1-28**] a presumed connection bewteen abdominal and pericardial spaces.
- EKG [**6-14**] showed q-waves in III and avF suggestive of prior MI.
Trivial pericardial effusion.
# HYPOTHYROID: - continue levothyroxine 62.5mg IV while not taking home dose (125mcg PO QD).
# LLE WOUND: The 5x2cm wound appears to be clean with good granulation, and currently without edema/warmth.
Pt is s/p a course of nafcillin starting [**6-13**] for concern over cellulitis, and the wound is being followed by wound care rn.
# METASTATIC OVARIAN CA: Pt is being followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (covered by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and per the most recent note has elected to pursue further treatment which is being planned to follow the resolution of her inpatient issues.
