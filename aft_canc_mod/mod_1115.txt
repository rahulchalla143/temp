The patient has had an ulceration on the right lateral ankle and has noticed that it has been worsening in appearance over the last few days with increasing erythema.
She denies any vomiting, constipation or diarrhea.
She denies any headaches, chest pain, shortness of breath or abdominal pain.
The patient also complains of pain at the dorsum of her right foot and anterior aspect of her lower leg.
Metastatic thyroid cancer, status post resection and radiation.
Chronic arachnoiditis.
Chronic back pain.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
History of colon adenoma.
Pepcid causing mental status changes.
Intravenous Nitroglycerin causes mental status changes.
There is no lymphadenopathy and no neck tenderness.
Cardiovascular, tachycardiac, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
There is no organomegaly, no rebound or guarding.
The patient has no sensation to light touch below the thighs on both lower extremities, and below the elbows in both upper extremities.
On the left heel there is a superficial ulceration on the medial aspect.
The lateral malleolus had a superficial ulceration with fibrotic center and mild serous drainage.
There is no pus or purulence.
There is no exposed base.
There is a descending cellulitis on the right side to the mid anterior shaft, no calf vein, mild tenderness directly adjacent to the ulceration of the lateral malleolus.
Right lower extremity cellulitis and ulcerations - The patient was admitted to the Podiatry Service on [**3-10**] for the cellulitis of the right lower extremity.
On admission she was started on Vancomycin, Levaquin and Flagyl for broad coverage.
Both grew out Escherichia coli.
The patient has also had hardware in her right ankle and because of the possibility that this was seated, the patient required surgery.
Her Coumadin was discontinued and once her INR had decreased close to baseline, she was taken to the Operating Room for hardware removal.
Then due to concern for pneumonia her antibiotic coverage was changed to Zosyn and Vancomycin.
Her left lower extremity ulcer also continued to improve.
X-rays showed an old fracture without any changes in the left foot.
The patient did not have any further signs of worsening cellulitis or infection of her extremities.
Respiratory - On [**3-20**], the patient developed hypoxia with an oxygen saturation of 80% on room air and hypertension with systolic blood pressure in the 190s.
She was also complaining of a new productive cough.
Chest x-ray done on that day was consistent with congestive heart failure and the patient was given Lasix.
There is also question of a right lower lobe infiltrate on the chest x-ray, so Azithromycin was initially added to her regimen of Ceftriaxone and Oxacillin.
On the same day, the patient also developed mental status changes which was possibly thought to be related to her hypoxia.
At this point, due to concern for pneumonia and respiratory compromise, the patient's antibiotic coverage was changed to Vancomycin and Zosyn and she was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for closer monitoring.
The patient's respiratory status improved with decrease in oxygen requirements.
Once the sputum culture was negative for any bacteria and there was no evidence of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus her Vancomycin was discontinued.
She was continued on Zosyn for treatment of possible aspiration pneumonia and for her cellulitis.
Congestive heart failure - The patient required Lasix intermittently for mild hypoxia and crackles on lung examination indicative of congestive heart failure.
initially and then titrated up for afterload reduction.
While off Coumadin the patient was on a heparin drip for her history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
Chronic back pain - The patient had chronic back for which she had been on Nubain at home.
Hypothyroidism - The patient was continued on Levoxyl.
Dysphagia - The patient had a swallowing study previously done in [**Month (only) 1096**], in order to evaluate symptoms of dysphagia.
This showed a possible offer for esophageal sphincter dysfunction, no further workup was done at the time.
On this admission there is a question of aspiration pneumonia and the patient was re-evaluated by the swallowing service.
Again there was no evidence of aspiration but evidence that there was upper esophageal dysfunction.
Anemia - The patient has a history of chronic anemia requiring blood transfusions.
There were no signs of active bleeding.
The iron studies showed a mixed picture with decreased iron and TIBC and elevated Ferritin.
The patient's iron to TIBC ratio was low suggesting a possible combination of iron deficiency anemia, anemia of chronic disease and possibly anemia related to the patient's hypothyroidism.
The patient was given blood transfusions as needed to maintain her hematocrit greater than 30, given her history of congestive heart failure.
Aspiration pneumonia.
Congestive heart failure.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
Chronic anemia.
History of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
Diabetes Type 2.
Chronic back pain.
Anxiety disorder.
