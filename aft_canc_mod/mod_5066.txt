Evaluated in the [**Hospital 66361**] clinic and schedule for Brain mass resection.
No focal motor/sensory deficit at the time of the exam.

At the operative site, there remains some low signal intensity air.
These areas of hemorrhage are comparable in size to those seen on the CT.
There is normal enhancement of the superior sagittal sinus and no engorgement of veins is seen anteriorly to suggest occlusion of it.
There is some gyral enhancement near the operative site, perhaps related to focal venous hypertension.
Surrounding the operative site and blood breakdown products, there is FLAIR hyperintensity extending inferiorly into the centrum semiovale, in large part corresponding to the preoperative edema seen on the scanned in images from [**2191-12-30**].
There is susceptibility effect from the air and deoxyhemoglobin on the diffusion-weighted images.
There is high signal intensity in part related to the hemorrhage as well.
It is difficult to exclude a small area of restricted diffusion.
No large territorial infarct is identified, however.
There is effacement of the left frontal and parietal sulci and slight mass effect on the posterior aspect of left lateral ventricle, unchanged.
There is fluid in some of the ethmoid air cells, an air fluid level in the right maxillary sinus and opacification of many of the mastoid air cells.
Scalp edema is noted.
The superior sagittal sinus enhances normally and does not appear to be occluded.
As seen on the CT of [**1-10**], the operative site involves the posterior frontal lobe and anterior parietal lobe extending into the centrum semiovale with heterogeneous areas of blood breakdown products, and edema.
The inferior extension of the edema corresponds to the vasogenic edema seen on the preoperative study.
It is difficult to exclude a small area of infarction in this region given the considerable artifact on the diffusion-weighted images.
Thick leptomeningeal enhancement suggests that there may be a degree of focal venous hypertension.
There is an air fluid level in the right maxillary sinus, likely related to the recent surgery/intubation.
After sedation was weaned and extubated, the patient was noticed to have a righ side weakness.
Further CT scan did not show any new head bleeding.
He recovered the operation well, the righ side weakness improved and was able to be transfered to Rehab for further physical therapy work.
