MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2106-10-15**]):    No MRSA isolated.
ECG [**10-12**]: Wide complex tachycardia with right bundle-branch block and marked right axis deviation.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2105-3-28**] the rhythm, rate and intraventricular conduction delay with right bundle-branch block pattern and marked right axis deviation are all new.
A second, non-clinical VT was also induced with triple extra-stimuli (RBBB, right inferior axis).
LV voltage mapping demonstrated a small dense scar on the basal posterolateral wall.
Brief Hospital Course: 75M with hx of DLBC Lymphoma in remission, hypertension, CAD status post MI and CABG in [**2054**], and diabetes presenting with acute onset of shortness of breath found to have wide complex tachycardia consistent with ventricular tachycardia emanating from site of old cardiac scar now s/p VT ablation.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES: .
# Symptomatic Ventricular Tachycardia From Old Ischemic Scar: Mr. [**Known lastname 3273**] has a history of CAD s/p CABG and is now presenting with symptomatic wide complex tachycardia diagnosed as ventricular tachycardia.
TSH was wnl's and he did not have EKG findings or cardiac enzymes concerning for acute ischemia.
He underwent an EP study and VT substrate ablation (for full details please see EP study report) complicated by moderate left groin hematoma which was treated with local pressure and did not progress in size or cause a drop in blood counts or symptoms for the patient.
Following the procedure, he had frequent PVC's and occasional runs of trigeminy on telemetry but no frank runs of NSVT or VT and no symptoms.
He was discharged home with follow-up in clinic and was given strict instruction to seek urgent medical cafe if he experienced similar symptoms going forward.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES: .
# Hx Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma in Remission: Stable.
# CAD s/p remote CABG: Stable.
# NIDDM Type 2: Stable.
# Celiac Sprue: Stable.
# Chronic Pain: Stable.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic in [**2-24**] weeks and will need an echocardiogram prior (already ordered in OMR)  Medications on Admission: -acyclovir 400 mg Tablet by mouth twice a day -glipizide 2.5 mg Tablet Extended Rel 24 hr daily -nr oxycodone 10 mg Tablet Extended Release 12 hr [**Hospital1 **] -nr oxycodone 5 mg Tablet 1 to 2 Tablet(s) by mouth q6h prn pain -ranitidine HCl 150 mg Tablet by mouth Twice daily -simvastatin 20 mg Tablet by mouth Daily -cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) 1,000 unit Tablet by mouth daily  -cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) 500mcg daily  Discharge Medications: 1. acyclovir 400 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).

You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation and treatment of shortness of breath.
You were found to have an abnormal heart rhythm called ventricular tachycardia or VT likely related to a scar in your heart from your old heart attack.
Following the study, you have not had any abnormal heart rhythms on our cardiac monitors.
If you feel shortness of breath without good cause, light-headedness, chest pain, or palpitations, please seek medical attention urgently as there is a chance this rhythm could come back.
As a result of the procedure, you have a moderately sized hematoma (blood collection under the skin) in your left groin which has been decreasing in size.
The skin on your groin or thigh may develop a discoloration (red, purple, yellow, or blue) which should not concern you unless you have a significant amount of pain in your groin or leg.
The following changes have been made to your medications: -START Metoprolol Succinate 50mg by mouth once daily -START Colace 100mg by mouth twice daily -START Senna 1 tab by mouth twice daily as needed for constipation -Continue taking your other home medications as directed.
