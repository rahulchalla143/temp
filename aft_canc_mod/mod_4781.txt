This is a nonspecific imaging finding and the differential diagnosis includes tumor, encephalitis or venous ischemia.
Primary traumatic injury is felt to be much less likely.
The imaging findings could be consistent with lymphoma.
MRI Head c/s contrast [**8-19**]  Right frontal signal abnormality with a central portion of restricted diffusion is not typical for an infarction and is predominantly involving the white matter.
The restricted diffusion could favor infiltrative lesion with high cellularity such as lymphoma or encephalitis.
NC CT Head [**8-30**] Status post open biopsy from a right frontal approach with a small amount of subarachnoid blood; right frontal sulcal effacement and vasogenic edema similar to [**2113-8-18**], head CT.  MRI Head c/s contrast [**8-30**] 1.
