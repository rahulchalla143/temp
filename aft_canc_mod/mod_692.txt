Pt developed persistent epistaxis at 2 pm today, still bleeding 7 hours later.
Pt states 30 lb weight loss over past month.
His back pain has been so severe that he has not been able to walk properly for the past 2.5 months.
The back pain projects down in and along the spinal canal, from the shoulder blades down to his buttocks, worst in disc surgery site in lower thoracic/upper lumbar spine.
The pain radiates to his buttocks bilaterally, and radiates down his leg posterolaterally bilaterally.
The pt has experienced motor weakness in both legs for the past 2.5 months, no tingling, no sensory loss.
No bladder or rectal incontinence.
No erectile dysfunction.
Pt has felt fatigued and short of breath for the past few months.
Pt has never had a bone marrow biopsy.
Pt also has 50 pk yr smoking hx and COPD, and chronic dyspnea on exertion.
Pt has been hospitalized in [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for the past 4 weeks, for intractable back pain, bilateral hilar and mediastinal adenopathy, anemia, thrombocytopenia, pneumonia, MRSA.
Pt had a fine needle aspiration of a right lower lung lesion, but before FNA, pt was noted as having low plts and hct of 19.
The patient had hemoptysis with small amounts of bloody sputum.
Pt was in constant pain at [**Hospital1 1474**], and needed his pain regimen adjusted constantly until placed on a PCA pump.
HTN 3.
CAD 5.

Family History: Healthy, uncle may have had cancer, no family member had or have similar symptoms  Physical Exam: Vitals:  98.9 / 92 / 28 / 96% sat on 2 L / 132/70 Gen:  Ambulatory, breathing loudly HEENT:  No JVD, PERRL Lungs:  CTAB Chest:  No pain on palpation, purpura on chest, barrel-chested Heart:  RRR, no m/r/g, clear S1/S2, no S3/S4 Abdomen:  Distended, firm, bumpy on palpation, NT, +BS, purpura and petechiae on abdomen, hepatosplenomegaly is difficult to appreciate due to distension of abdomen and bowel Back:  Tenderness to palpation along spine from shoulder blades down to buttocks, most tenderness in T8 area of disc surgery, tenderness with palpation of buttocks, less tenderness in cervical spine LYMPH:  No anterior/posterior cervical/supraclavicular LN, no axillary or inguinal LN Genital:  Vesicle/wart in suprapubic area, discomfort on palpation Extremities:  1+ pitting edema bilaterally Neuro:  [**6-13**] motor, sensory equal and intact throughout, good rectal tone and sensation, leg raise to 80 degrees bilaterally without pain, 2+ pulses throughout, PERRL  Pertinent Results: [**2120-8-3**] 08:15PM   PT-12.7 PTT-20.4* INR(PT)-1.1 [**2120-8-3**] 08:15PM   PLT SMR-VERY LOW PLT COUNT-56* [**2120-8-3**] 08:15PM   HYPOCHROM-NORMAL ANISOCYT-1+ POIKILOCY-1+ MACROCYT-1+ MICROCYT-1+ POLYCHROM-1+ STIPPLED-1+ HOW-JOL-1+ [**2120-8-3**] 08:15PM   NEUTS-52 BANDS-12* LYMPHS-19 MONOS-6 EOS-0 BASOS-1 ATYPS-1* METAS-5* MYELOS-3* PROMYELO-1* NUC RBCS-7* [**2120-8-3**] 08:15PM   WBC-5.6 RBC-3.46* HGB-10.4* HCT-29.3* MCV-85 MCH-30.2 MCHC-35.6* RDW-15.9* [**2120-8-3**] 08:15PM   calTIBC-235* FERRITIN-GREATER TH TRF-181* [**2120-8-3**] 08:15PM   ALBUMIN-3.6 CALCIUM-9.4 PHOSPHATE-2.9 MAGNESIUM-2.0 URIC ACID-4.8 IRON-57 [**2120-8-3**] 08:15PM   ALT(SGPT)-38 AST(SGOT)-90* LD(LDH)-4712* ALK PHOS-105 TOT BILI-0.8 [**2120-8-3**] 08:15PM   GLUCOSE-114* UREA N-23* CREAT-0.7 SODIUM-133 POTASSIUM-4.3 CHLORIDE-97 TOTAL CO2-25 ANION GAP-15  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 67 yo M, PMH of DM, CAD (CABG), DJD (disc surgery), COPD, presents with epistaxis, purpura, lymphadenopathy, severe back pain, anemia, thrombocytopenia, fevers, fatigue x months, 30 lb weight loss over past month.
Other possibilities are Wegener's (hemoptysis, but no renal failure), sarcoidosis (but unusual patient profile, and Ca is 9.4).
In [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital, the pt had undergone a CT Chest, which showed mediastinal LAD and a RLL lesion.
FNA of a RLL lesion was performed, and Dr.[**Name (NI) 16211**] initial impression was small cell ca of the lung.
At [**Hospital1 18**], a CT Torso was performed, demonstrating diffuse giant LAD throughout the mediastinum and abdomen, as well as a RLL lesion, 2 small liver lesions (one in caudate lobe, one in left lobe), and no splenomegaly.
Since the patient had SOB, chest pain, and a R apical pneumothorax after his mediastinoscopy at [**Hospital1 1474**], it was decided that the giant lymph nodes found on CT Torso, the lung lesion, and 2 liver lesions would not be biopsied, in case the results of the bone marrow aspirate were sufficient for diagnosis.
BACK PAIN: Diff Dx:  Back pain could be due to myeloma (lytic lesions), colon ca (pathologic fx), mets to bone from lung ca (pathologic fx), slipped disc.
T- and L-spine XR showed neither a pathologic fracture nor lytic lesions.
Neurologic findings showed R LE weakness.
MRI of the Head, C-, T-, and L-spine ruled out cord compression, but a possibility of an epidural tumor was noted at T10/T11.
The next day, neurologic findings progressed to R LE and R UE weakness and decreased pinprick sensation, and decreased R lower face pinprick sensation.
MRI Head showed a possible subacute pontine infarct.
Pt has a h/o spinal fusion surgery [**30**] years ago, and an LP under fluoro was attempted to rule out carcinomatous meningitis.
However, while attempting to lie on his abdomen, the pt was in excruciating pain and his O2 sat dropped to 90%, and the LP could not be performed.
Epistaxis ceased only after infusion of 1 unit plts.
ANEMIA: Diff Dx:  Anemia of Hct 29.3 suggests colon ca in a 67 yo male (but no black stools, normal bore stools), myeloma, lymphoma, hemolytic anemia, splenomegaly and reticuloendothelial system can be destroying RBC.
With fever and thrombocytopenia, TTP is a possibility, but no renal failure or neuro changes (although these are late developments).
Results of uric acid, haptoglobin, retics, total bili, and no schistocytes indicated that a hemolytic anemia or TTP was unlikely.
CBC with diff twice showed selectively early myeloid precursors in the peripheral blood.
A peripheral smear (showing erythroblasts and no tear drop cells) and bone marrow aspirate was performed by Hem-Onc (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 16212**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The results of the BM aspirate revealed a diagnosis of small cell carcinoma of the lung with squamous morphology, an undifferentiated tumor.
THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Diff Dx:  Plts of 56 with epistaxis and purpura indicates a functional, qualitative thrombocytopenia, suggesting bone marrow suppression, production problem (liver failure and tpo, but bili is WNL), destruction by splenomegaly (should be increase in megakaryocytes).
SOB: Pt's baseline SOB was attributed to COPD (emphysema), as CXR taken for possibility of post-obstructive pneumonia showed no infiltrates.
Exacerbated SOB was attributed to R pneumothorax.
Echo had also been planned as preparation for possible future cancer therapy.
PAIN: Both at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital and [**Hospital1 18**], pt's pain was difficult to control.
Pt's pain is episodic, at times [**3-21**] to 10+/10, feels like "sharp, electric shock pain", helped by position of sitting or lying down on his back, and precipitated by muscle use.
Pt's pain was successfully controlled on a morphine PCA pump at a maximum of 10 mg/hr.
CAD: Pt's CAD is chronic.
He had been maintained on Metoprolol and ASA, but no ACE-I or [**Last Name (un) **].
Pt's ASA was discontinued due to pt's bleeding tendency.
HTN: Pt's HTN is chronic, and well-controlled on Metoprolol.
COPD (Emphysema): Pt has a 50 pk-yr smoking history and emphysema, and was maintained at >95% O2 sat on 2L O2 nasal cannula alone.
FEN: Due to pt's 30 lb weight loss over the past month, decreased appetite, and possible cachexia, a house diet and periodic IVFs of D5 0.45NS were provided.
PROPHYLAXIS: Due to pt's bleeding tendency, pneumoboots and no heparin sc were used.
