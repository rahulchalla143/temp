Admission Date:  [**2173-3-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-3-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2116-5-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: Fatigue, Diarrhea, elevated INR  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: 56 y/o female with PMHx significant for metastatic pancreatic cancer who presents with elevated INR of 10 and fatigue.
Patient states that initially she has been having diarrhea for the past 5 weeks, non-bloody.
Within the last week her diarrhea has resolved however now she has nausea and vomiting, constipation and decreased appetite.
Her husband at home has also noticed that her cellulitis at her left buttock region has gotten worse.
She did not have any obvious active bleeding.
However she subsequently developed respiratory distress secondary to pulmonary edema likely due to volume overload and required brief intubation.
she was also treated for pneumonia with vanco-zosyn-azithyromycin which was subsequently narrowed down to levofloxacin alone.
pt has a history of spinal myoclonus and had mri of spine per neuro rec.
she continues to have some diarrhoe and c diff was sent.
Furthermore she had some pre-renal azotemia for which she was rehydrated with normalisation of her renal function.
Past Medical History: Onc Hx: The patient was diagnosed with metastatic nonfunctioning islet cell cancer of the pancreas in [**2166**] when she presented with bony mets.
She had persistent low back pain after an MVA, not relieved with chiropractor.
She has mets to the liver, breast, scalp, calvarium, thoracic and lumbar vertebra, s/p XRT x 2 to the low back and once to the upper back.
-depression -low back pain -history of cauda equina syndrome -hypothyroidism -GERD -Raynaud's syndrome of the feet and peripheral neuropathy [**1-15**] thalidomide.
Family History: Dad died of lung CA and also smoked  Physical Exam: On tranfer to OMED service: PE: 98.6 BP 115/74 HR 90/min RR 16 O2Sat 99% 2L Gen: comfortable at rest, no apparent distress Heent: PERLAA, oropharynx clear.
Neck: supple, no jvd Lungs: mild rhonchi bilaterally Cardiac: rrr, nl s1+s2, SEM [**1-19**] Abd: soft, non tender, nl bs Back: Skin irritation on upper back [**1-15**] radiation; circular erythematous lesion 5x5cm on L buttock cheek resolving.
Chest Xray [**3-15**]: IMPRESSION: Interval significant progression of bilateral mid- and lower lung opacities suggestive of interval fluid overload or development of ARDS.
No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
Progression of metastatic disease within the lungs and liver.
Questionable hemmorhagic metastasis noted within the liver may explain mild Hct drop.
Scattered areas of ill- defined patchy opacities within the lung parenchyma.
Differential included infectious or inflammatory etiologies with areas of hemorrhage from early metastatic lesions felt unlikely, but not completely excluded.
Stable appearance of diffuse osseous metastatic disease.
MRI C/T/L spine [**3-17**]:  L-spine: Mild interval improvement in the epidural extent and spinal canal stenosis produced by expansile bony metastases in the L2 and L3 verterbal bodies since [**2172-12-19**].
The epidural component of an expansile metastasis in the L5 vertebral body is also decreased - there is no spinal canal stenosis at this level.
T-spine: Diffuse osseous metastases are again noted.
While no axial images were acquired, there is epidural disease in the paracentral regions bilaterally posterior to the T10 vertebral body, causing mild spinal canal stenosis.
Bilateral paracentral epidural disease posterior to the T11 vertebral body is more prominent on the right.
C-spine: Interval progression of disease from most recent MR C spine dated [**2173-5-15**].
Multiple bony metastases have increased in size and number.
There is epidural extension of disease with mild spinal canal stenosis posterior to C4 and moderate stenosis posterior to C6.
Paraspinal disease cases neural foraminal narrowing at multiple levels and encases the right verterbal artery from C3-4.
CXR [**3-18**]: IMPRESSION: Improved bilateral diffuse air space opacity likely representing pulmonary edema.
Doubt focal consolidation.
Brief Hospital Course: 56 y/o female with PMHx of metastatic pancreatic cancer who presents with fatigue, n/v, and elevated INR admitted to ICU for close monitoring, transferred to the floor, then returned to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with mental status changes which resolved with intravenous hydration, empiric antibiotic coverage.
This was most likely secondary to volume overload exacerbated by pneumonia.
Patient has had recurrence of her muscle spasms overnight and this morning.
## Elevated INR - thought to be secondary to chronic diarrhea and poor nutrition.
- trend coags; INR mildly elevated today but much lower than on admission.
## Nausea and Vomiting - Unclear if this is related to pancreatic cancer as it has been occuring for a few weeks now or secondary to infection; could also be secondary to opiates - cont Anzemet, Ativan, Zydis .
## Anemia - Patient with history anemia outpatient requiring blood transfusions.
## Back Pain - Patient with chronic pain from metastatic pancreatic cancer and on outpatient oxycodone - continue analgesic therapy .
## H/O shingles - cont acyclovir, but we redosed to q8h due to improving renal function.
## Acute renal failure - patient's creat went to 1.5, baseline 0.6-0.9.
Most likely secondary to pre-renal azotemia from volume depletion - no further diuresis at present.
- monitor fluid status and I/O carefully .
## Hypothyroidism - Will continue outpatient thyroid replacement  .
## Cellulitis - Will monitor cellulitis on buttock region.
