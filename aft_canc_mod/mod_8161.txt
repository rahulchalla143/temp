Does report ongoing diffuse abdominal pain, bloating and poor appetitite since going home from [**Hospital1 2025**] last week.
Unaware of liver disease previously, unaware of cause of liver disease at this time.
Exam revealed jaundice with distended, tender abdomen.
Labs revealed hyponatremia to 122, hyperkalemia to 6.1 (nonhemolyzed), WBC 23.5, Hct 30, lactate 2.2, and Cr 2.5.
Urine cultures sent but no blood cultures.
Extensive workup showed abdominal discomfort likely a result of previously-undiagnosed tuberculous peritonitis.
Peritoneal fluid showed lymphocytic peritonitis, bacterial and AFB cultures negative.
CT Abd/Pelvis findings raised concern for peritoneal TB, so he had surgical laparotomy for omental and peritoneal biopsies which showed granulomatous infiltration, giant cells concerning for TB.
No cough, and chest imaging not suggestive of pulmonary TB so [**Hospital1 2025**] did not get induced sputums.
In addition, all abdominal imaging at [**Hospital1 2025**] (MR, CT, US) showed nodular cirrhotic liver and ascites.
Abdominal CT also showed 3.7 cm lesion in liver concerning for cholangiocarcinoma (CA19-9 66 (normal 0-36)) but IR-guided biopsy was nondiagnostic.
GI consult performed an EGD which showed grade I varices and gastritis, no active bleeding.
Daily labs by DOT VNA on [**5-7**] showed mildly increasing LFTs, tbili 10.1->10.8 alkphos 173 ALT 29 AST 78.
Plan was to continue current regimen (INH, moxifloxacin, ethambutol) until clear evidence of worsening LFTs.
DPH DOT nurses stopped following over weekend and when they were able to contact him again yesterday, were told by patient/family that they did *not* want to take TB meds and did not believe he had a TB infection because they heard his CXR was clear.
No hx blood transfusions, IVDU or incarceration.

IMAGING [**5-15**] RUQ US FINDINGS: The liver is heterogeneous and nodular consistent with cirrhosis.
No focal liver lesions are identified.
There is trace perihepatic ascites.
The wall is mildly thickened, likely due to abdominal ascites.
There is no evidence of cholecystitis.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
The kidneys are unremarkable without renal stones, masses, or hydronephrosis.
There is a large amount of hypoechoic complex fluid within the mid abdomen extending into the bilateral lower quadrants, more so on the left than the right.
There is also complex hypoechoic fluid in [**Location (un) 6813**] pouch.
There is no increased vascularity.
These findings are most consistent with hemorrhagic or infected ascites.
Cirrhotic liver without focal masses.
Complex fluid within the abdomen may be hemorrhagic or infected ascites.
Sludge within the gallbladder, but no evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Bibasilar opacities are seen which in combination with recent ultrasound are likely due to bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation not excluded.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis; underlying consolidation not excluded.
[**2143-5-17**] Abdominal U/S Ascites search: Limited four quadrant ultrasound was performed to assess for ascites.
Limited ultrasound demonstrates the presence of loculated ascites bilaterally.
There was no large pocket of fluid visualized within all four quadrants to target for paracentesis.
IMPRESSION: Extensive loculated ascites with no large pocket of fluid identified to target for paracentesis.
[**2143-5-17**] CXR (portable): There is a Dobbhoff tube within the stomach.
There are bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar opacities which may represent atelectasis.
Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar opacities, which may represent atelectasis.
Bilateral pleural effusions and volume loss/consolidation in the lower lobes are again visualized.
Patent main portal vein with reversal of flow, consistent with cirrhosis.
Extensively loculated ascites is not amenable for therapeutic paracentesis.
Small right pleural effusion.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2143-5-22**] 5:17 PM FINDINGS:  The Dobbhoff tip projects over the right upper quadrant, and is likely located in the distal stomach or proximal duodenum.
Known bilateral pleural effusions from the previous radiograph.
[**Doctor Last Name **] Gross Description by:   DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]    SPECIMEN SUBMITTED:    Slides referred for consultation.

Moderate septal, mild periseptal and lobular mixed inflammation consisting of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and rare plasma cells.
Radiologic and clinical correlation, as to the site of sampling, is recommended.
Note #2:   The findings are that of an end stage cirrhotic liver with features consistent with toxic/ metabolic injury.
There is no explanation for a mass lesion in this biopsy.
The patient's name on the corresponding report is "[**Known lastname 97865**], [**Known firstname **] C."  Addendum added by: DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]/mavf Date: [**2143-5-31**]  Clinical:   Liver mass; Question cholangiocarcinoma vs abscess vs TB.

3.6x2.8 cm well-circumscribed lesions within segment 5 of the liver has no engancement material phase and subsequent hyperenhancement on delayed images, with the appearance of a focal mass rather than focal infection.
This lesion does not have an appearance typical for metastatic carcinoma.
Enhancement pattern raises the suspicion for cholangiocarcinoma, although less likely may represent a secondary primary of unknown etiology.
Heterogeneous perfusion of the liver predominant central portion around the oprta hepatis likely perfusion anomaly due to underlying cirrhosis.
Nodular hepatic contour, suggesting cirrhosis.
Omental and peritoneal increased vascularity and hyperemia.
Enhancing peritoneal lining and mesenteric stranging suggestive of peritonitis.
Differential considerations include tuberculous peritonitis.

H pylori samples sent (pending)     Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 97865**] is a 40 year old Peruvian gentleman with recent diagnoses of alcoholic hepatitis and TB peritonitis, hospitalized at [**Hospital1 2025**] [**Date range (1) 110528**] for these problems, admitted with increasing abdominal pain and distention after not taking his medications for several days, now being treated for TB peritonitis, with MICU course c/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] concerning for HRS and decompensated liver cirrhosis.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # TB PERITONITIS: Diagnosed at [**Hospital1 2025**] a few weeks prior to this admission, when he was admitted for abdominal discomfort.
Diagnosis initially suspected due to pt's when CT scan was suggestive of peritoneal TB,  TB-spot and quantiferon gold positive and peritoneal/omental biopsies demonstrated granulomatous inflammation.
Being from [**Location (un) **] is his primary risk factor; no IVDU or prison/homeless exposures.
# ETOH CIRRHOSIS Pt w/jaundice elevated DF on admission.
Patient subsequently had BRBPR with approximately 100cc of gross blood in stool.
Large volume paracentesis by IR was not able to be obtained as above.
He showed no signs of hepatic encephalopathy during his course.
# Anemia Pt reported small volume BRB in toilet bowl on day PTA.
No prior hx GIB symptoms.
Pt could have rectal varices, or hemorrhoids.
Had repeat gross blood in stool on HD 2 and was started on octreotide and pantoprazole gtt.
After transfer out of the MICU, patient continued to experience Guaiac positive stool, with occasional small amount of bright red blood at the end of his bowel movement.
#Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis- During this hospitalization the pt was complaining of increasing abdominal pain.
His abdominal pain resolved with this regimen.
# Abdominal Cellulitis- During this hospitalization the pt developed a cellulitic rash on his abdominal wall that was spreading outside outlined boarders.
#[**Name (NI) 110531**] Pt developed significant LE edema during this hospitalization.
This was related to his underlying liver cirrhosis and initial discontinuation of diuretics due to [**Last Name (un) **].
Once his kidney failure was improving with treatment for HRS, torsemide was initiated and the pt's urine out and kidney function improved further.
After discontinuation of tube feedings his LE edema began to slowly improve as well.
# HYPERKALEMIA Pt dehydrated with hx poor PO intake over the past week.
# HYPONATREMIA Often corresponds w/liver failure.
# ASCITES Paracentesis in ED not c/w SBP.
Therapeutic  paracentesis was not obtainable due to significant loculations of the ascitic fluid.
His abdominal ascites improved with initiation of Torsemide.
# Transitional: 1. pt is discharged to [**Hospital **] hospital for further antibiotic treatment 2.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 2222**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Liver Cirrhosis TB Peritonitis Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital with acute liver failure, acute kidney failure and concern for an abdominal infection with TB.
