Pt noted mild b/l LE swelling over the last two days which he has never experienced before.
He denies any CP, SOB but noted some dizziness and lightheadedness over the last few days.
Per his report, he developed the LE swelling after his last whole brain radiation on Friday and was told by his radiation-oncologist that it might be related to that and the steroids he is currently receiving.
However, a CXR revealed an infiltrate below his lung mass in line with post-obstructive pneumonia.
On ROS, he endorsed a mildly productive cough over the last two weeks.
No F/C/N noted.
[**Name (NI) **] CP or SOB as above.
No urinary symptoms or abnormal bowel movements.
No blood in stool or urine noted.
No nosebleeds but easy bruising.
Chronic back pain from spinal mets with no change in severity.
Initially presentation with bulky disease and near complete tracheal obstruction s/p Y stenting (removed again in 10/[**2104**]).
Initially, believed to have extensive stage disease, with metastases in the left adrenal gland and liver.
However, follow-up CT scans revealed no change in the adrenal lesion while his pulmonary lesions decreased in size.
In addition, the hepatic lesions seen on his initial CT were not seen on later exams were felt to be an artifact and not metastatic spread.
Past Medical History: - PAF, on Amio, not on anticoagulation (has been on coumadin prior to his first round of chemo in [**2104**]); followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] (last seen on [**2106-7-7**]) - HTN - Hyperlipidemia - CRI, Cr baseline 1.4 - PVD - AAA S/P repair over one year ago - ?
Etoh abuse - H/o S. bovis endocarditis (during first cycle of chemo); s/p 4 wks of penicillin in [**9-/2105**] - Colonoscopy on [**2105-9-1**]: fragments of adenoma with high grade dysplasia and focal intramucosal carcinoma but no invasive carcinoma.
- SCLC as above   Social History: Lives alone.
Family History: Son died of brain tumor at age 16.
Physical Exam: VS: Temp: 97.0, BP: 119/76 (on NE), HR: 97, RR: 18, O2sat 94% on 2L GEN: pleasant, comfortable, NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, dry MM NECK: no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, no jvd, right IJ in place RESP: coarse BS at both bases, no wheezes, rhales or rhonchi CV: Tachy, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly EXT: 1+ LE edema b/l, cold feet but good pulses SKIN: bruises b/l on UEs, no jaundice NEURO: AAOx3.
EKG: Afib at HR of 101, normal axis, no ST changes .
Again note is made of opacity in the right upper lobe extending from the right hilum, representing post-radiation change as seen on prior torso CT dated [**2106-5-27**].
Linear atelectasis in right upper lobe with pleural thickening is again noted.
There is atelectasis in the right lower lobe.
IMPRESSION: Overall unchanged appearance of the chest with post-radiation change and volume loss of the right lung.
MRI spine [**2106-7-19**]: Diffuse leptomeningeal metastases involving the lower thoracic cord, the conus medullaris, and the cauda equina.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm just above the aortic bifurcation measuring approximately 3.1 cm in size.
Mild degenerative changes of the lumbar spine with multilevel mild bilateral foraminal stenoses, but without canal stenosis.
MRI brain [**2106-6-25**]: Multiple, new metastatic lesions (left parietal; left medial temporal lobe; met extending from the pituitary infundibulum into the hypothalamus; right lateral pons; left cerebellar tonsil and the left cerebellar hemisphere; right frontal leptomeningeal metastasis).
Brief Hospital Course: 75-yr-old male with PAF (on amio), HTN, AAA, CRI (Cr baseline 1.4), SCLC with brain and spinal mets (diagnosed in [**7-19**], treated with five cycles of carboplatin/Taxol + chest XRT) s/p recent whole brain radiation, who presented to the ED with LE swelling but was found to have hypotension, fever and RLL infiltrate.
Likely source is lungs given RLL infiltrate on CXR, which was confirmed on CT. UA was negative and no urinary symptoms.
No abdominal tenderness and LFTs wnl.
Thus, no other obvious sources making pneumonia most likely reason for his fever/hypotension.
Likely component of dehydration contributing to hypotension as out of proportion of other clinical picture.
He remained off suppelmental oxygen and was afebrile with normal WBC.
Towards the end of hospitalization, patient developed presumed herpetic oral ulcers.
Patient had continued hypotension, HTN meds held, believed to be due to poor PO intake.
# Thrombocytopenia, now leukocytopenia: Plt of 58 on admission.
H/o easy bruising but no overt bleeding.
LE minimal on exam today.
# Acute on CRF: CRI due to HTN per OMR.
Likely prerenal given dehydration and recent orthostatic hypotension as outpatient.
Received IVF for septic picture and Cr down to 0.9 today.
# SCLC: SCLC with brain and spinal mets.
Diagnosis in [**7-/2105**] with bulky disease and near complete tracheal obstruction s/p Y stenting and removal.
Was complaining of back pain radiating down buttocks.
# Chronic anemia: Hct baseline around 26-36.
Normal B12/folate in [**2105-10-14**], but high Ferritin in line with ACD due to malignancy.
# Oral Ulcers-  Believed to be herpetic in appearence.
Patient started on acyclovir and given lidocain gel for pain relief.
Patient with poor PO intake due to ulcers causing hypotension.
Polyvinyl Alcohol-Povidone 1.4-0.6 % Dropperette Sig: [**12-15**] Drops Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dry eyes.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 1456**] [**Hospital **] Health Care Center  Discharge Diagnosis: Pneumonia Small Cell Lung Cancer sepsis acute renal failure hypotension  Pneumonia Small Cell Lung Cancer sepsis acute renal failure   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions:   You are being discharged from the hospital after an admission for fevers and low blood pressure.
This pneumonia was so serious that it required hospitalization to the intensive care unit.
We have successfully been treating this infection with antibiotics, and your blood pressures have returned to [**Location 213**].
If you develop fevers, SOB, CP, confusion, or any other concerning symptoms call your doctor.
You have also developed oral ulcers which has made it difficult for you to eat/drink.
It is important that you drink at least 8 glasses of water of day, as poor water intake has caused low blood pressure.
