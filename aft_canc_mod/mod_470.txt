Of note, the patient was treated for ATN due to port-a-cath infection with sepsis and she has been on lasix at home since discharge in [**Month (only) **] [**2112**].
She reports poor po's due to mucositis and thrush over the past several weeks.
Routine blood work revealed the hypokalemia and she was referred into the ED this afternoon for further treatment.
EKG was without QTc or U waves.

Persistent small pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Diffuse osseous metastasis and old rib fractures.
TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-1-13**], probably no major change but the technically suboptimal nature of the present study precludes definitive comparison.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Name (NI) 13337**] is a 74 year old female with metastatic breast cancer on chemo (CMF, last tx [**2113-4-7**]) x3 wks with mucositis presents with increasing fatigue/weakness and hypokalemia to 2.1 in the setting of dehydration and diuretic use.
Pt does have a history of a small pericardial effusion and low voltage on EKG in the ED, although no other overt signs of tamponade.
TTE was obtained and showed a small pericardial effusion and no signs of tamponade.
* Bacteremia - On the day of admission, had blood culture drawn that returned positive for enterococcus and GNR, which were later identified as Enterobacteria.
While Enterobacteria was sensitive to Cipro, Cefepime will be continued since it is cheaper, is once a day, and patient is paying out of pocket for IV antibiotics.
TTE was negative for vegetations.
It was thought that admission hypokalemia was due to non-compliance with potassium supplements.
* Chronic renal insuffiency (stage 3) - Lasix was initially held, but restarted on [**2113-4-28**], and adjusted to 40mg [**Hospital1 **] on discharge.
* Port a cath wound infection - She suffered from this wound infection in [**12/2112**], but the wound remains open.
Surgery was called and felt no need for debridement, but recommeded plastics consult and breast consult in future given wound and h/o breast cancer.
She will need continued VNA care of her wound after discharge.
