She was admitted for r/o MI, found to be in atrial fibrillation and was started on rate control and coumadin.
Over the past week, the patient had increased SOB when walking and no SOB at rest.
No vomiting, no abdominal pain, and no BRBPR.

Skin: 5x5cm ecchymoses on L forearm HEENT: EOMI, PEERL, dry oral mucous membranes Neck: R IJ line removed & dressing over site c/d/i, no cervical LAD CV: irregular rate & rhythm, [**3-24**] holosystolic murmur, ventricular lift Pulm: scattered rhonchi throughout, no wheezes, mild bibasilar crackles Abd: protuberant, soft, non tender, no masses, no HSM Extr: no edema, warm, well perfused.
unable to lift R upper arm above head, no tenderness of R rotator cuff Neuro: AOx3 can state name "chickie," date [**2139-3-24**], place [**Hospital 61**] Hospital.
3+ biceps reflexes bilaterally, 2+ patellar reflexes.
Cardiomegaly with CHF and interstitial edema.
Right lower lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia.
No evidence of PE or aortic dissection.
5-mm right upper lobe nodule; follow-up CT within 12 months recommended to assess for stability.
Multiple ulcerated plaques within the descending aorta.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.
There is no pleural effusion demonstrated on this frontal view.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
There is no focal airspace consolidation.
[**2139-3-19**] ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2139-3-26**] CXR: No new acute parenchymal consolidations are identified and there is improvement to interstitial pulmonary edema and bilateral basilar atelectasis with remaining subsegmental plate-like atelectasis identified within the bases bilaterally.
A right-sided central venous catheter has been removed and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
[**2139-3-27**] Colonoscopy: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and descending colon.
Brief Hospital Course: 85 F with CAD s/p CABG, COPD, OSA on CPAP 15 qhs, HTN, AFib on coumadin who presented w/ SOB, anemia, and elevated INR.
The patient had increased dyspnea.
She was unable to lie supine, so she was intubated for CT scan due to concern for occult bleed as cause for Hct drop.
MICU course was complicated by repiratory distress on [**3-16**] due to flash pulmonary edema which resolved with lasix, epinephrine, and methylpredisone.
[**3-18**] she was reintubated due to hypoxemia believed to be due to upper airway edema as seen on bronchoscopy which improved w/ methylprednisolone.
#Pneumonia: Patient had a left lower lobe pneumnia diagnosed on [**2139-3-18**], she was treated with vancomycin and meropenam x 7days.
Bronchoscopy was done on [**2139-3-18**] to evaluate the upper airway edema s/p extubation and gram stain showed no microorganisms.
Due to leukocytosis, fever, and cough, the patient started on cipro 500mg po q12hrs x7 days and flagyl 500mg po q8hrs 7 days (day 4 of 7) for presumed aspiration pneumonia in setting of 2 intubations/extubations.
#CHF: Secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy and s/p 3v CABG.
Diastolic heart failure with EF>55%.
CT scan unrevealing and no evidence of dissection or retroperitoneal hematoma.
She had a normal EGD and negative abd CT for retroperitoneal bleed.
Anemia may be due to extensive ecchymoses on L forearm extending to upper arm that has been persistent since MICU course.
She has had no trauma to this area.
The colonoscopy showed diverticuli and polyps which were biopsied, however, no source for bleeding seen on lower or upper GI scope.
Aspirin was also d/c'd for risk of bleeding.
Given possible GI bleed & elevated INR, coumadin was held as confirmed per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1313**] PCP.
#CAD s/p CABG: no chest discomfort currently.
#FEN: tolerating po intake well with no evidence aspiration on speech and swallow evaluation, regular diet with salt restriction.
#R shoulder pain: s/p dislocation and with decreased ROM and weakness.
Patient should continue PT for ROM and mobility.
