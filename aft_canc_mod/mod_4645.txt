He endorses that he has been dehydrated and has had poor PO due to loss of appetite, such that he was actually going to be admitted for J tube placement when this event occurred.
He had several EKG's which were tachycardic and show S1Q3T3 but no acute ST changes.
Admitted to telemetry unit and ruled out for MI by enzymes and had normal EKG on admission.
Through admission they felt it was less likely that he had a seizure.
He then had an echo showing large thrombus in RV and is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management/intervention.
He had a CT C-spine concerning for metastases (see report below) and a left shoulder plain film concerning for mets (see below).
ROS is as above, including anorexia, wt loss (225 --> 140 now), chronic constipation and vomiting, dehydration.
Chronic L shoulder pain.

RV thrombus vs tumor: Patient underwent gated CT chest that was revealing for likely thrombus in RV, PE, and pulmonary infarcts.
LENIs were negative for DVTs bilaterally.
His outpatient oncologists was contact[**Name (NI) **] who stated that patient was a candidate for palliative chemotherapy and confirmed that he has progressive malignancy with poor response to chemo/radiation.
Syncopal episode: Likely related to RV thrombus and PE.
Patient had 3-4 beats of NSVT on telemetry but otherwise no arrythmia.
A head CT was done and was negative for metastasis.
Her outpt oncologist confirmed that MRI head did not show evidence of metastasis.
Stage IV tonsillar small cell carcinoma: Diagnosed about a year ago and is s/p chemo and radiation finished in [**12/2115**], no surgery.
Nutrition: S/p J tube placement [**2116-6-5**] due to persistent n/v and decreased PO intake, likely due to the malignancy, although further w/u for this is not noted in OSH reports.
No evidence of infection.
No evidence of bleeding or unstable Hct.
Unlikely to be HIT; could be related to consumption secondary to underlying clot.
Dilantin was continued for his seizure history.

Disp:*900 cc* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital3 **]Hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: RV thrombus PE Squamous cell metastastic lesion to base of skull   Discharge Condition: A&Ox3   Discharge Instructions: You were transfered to the BDIMC because of a clot seen in your heart at [**Hospital6 3105**].
While you were here we did a CT scan that showed clots in your lungs and a clot in your heart.
Your loss of consciousness was likely secondary to this clot.
We did a CT scan of your head that did not show any intracranial metastasis, but did show the metastasis to the base of your skull which is old.
Your platelets were low, likely from the clot and possibly from medications you have received.
This will help control your pain related to cancer.
Start senna, colace, bisacodyl, and lactulose as needed for constipation.
You should not be driving since you have had an active seizure within the past six months.
