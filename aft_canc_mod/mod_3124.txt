Admission Date:  [**2202-4-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2202-5-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2122-10-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 477**] Chief Complaint: Fevers and chills  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: TEE  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 79 yo M with a h/o of multiple myeloma along with multiple other medical problems including diabetes and severe cardiac disease including coronary artery disease and chronic ischemic heart disease with an ejection fraction of less than 25% along with chronic renal insufficiency p/w 1 week h/o "not feeling well" and 1 day h/o fevers/chills and cough.
The patient denies abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, or chest pain.
He reports some difficulty breathing over the last week and has gotten SOB with any activity.
He has had decreased PO intake over the last few days.
Past Medical History: DM HTN CAD- s/p CABG x 2 (LIMA-Diag, SVG-ramus then jump to OM, SVG-acute marginal then jump to rPDA) CHF- EF 20% s/p A flutter ablation s/p pacemaker (attempted BiV but only 1 lead placed) NSVT- s/p ICD [**9-28**] Multiple myeloma diagnosed by bone marrow biopsy in [**Month (only) 956**] [**2198**] with treatments including: Thalidomide, Methylprednisone, Melphalan.
Oncology History: Diagnosed with MM in [**12-29**] when he was noted to be mildly anemic with a hematocrit of 36.
Further workup with serum protein electrophoresis revealed a suppressed IgA and IgM with an elevated IgG of over 4 g consisting of monoclonal band.
Given his other medical issues, Mr. [**Known lastname 45794**] was initially treated with melphalan and prednisone, but this was complicated by low counts and poor tolerance.
He also took thalidomide for a period of time but he had increased dizziness and did not tolerate this well.
He, at times, would have pulses of Decadron twice in [**7-/2200**] and then 1 pulse in [**1-/2201**] but these often led to exacerbation of his congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization.
Because of his other medical issues, which were often exacerbated with treatment for his myeloma, he often was monitored by laboratory values and treated symptomatically for his myeloma.
He has been receiving Procrit for chronic anemia with periodic transfusions in order to maintain his hematocrit 28-30% due to his cardiac history.
In [**8-/2201**], Mr. [**Known lastname 45794**] was admitted due to worsening shortness of breath and exacerbation of his congestive heart failure with also increasing pain in the left hip area with more difficulty walking.
During the admission, he was found to have new lytic lesions in the hip and back and was treated with radiation therapy to the hip and back area along with a pulse of Decadron.
His last treatment (until this week) for his myeloma was with a 3-day pulse of melphalan at 10 mg daily starting on [**2201-10-12**].
Family History: Father laryngeal cancer, depression and history of gynecologic cancer in two or more relatives, mother MI at 72y/o   Physical Exam: VS - T 103 (rectally), HR 74 BP 113/47 O2 93% 4L General - thin male, NAD HEENT - PERRL, dry mucous membranes Neck - supple, RIJ in place Chest - RRR +pacer device in place Lungs - bilateral crackles at bases Abdomen - soft, NT/ND Ext - [**1-29**]+ pitting edema b/l   Pertinent Results: REPORTS: .
[**2202-4-23**] CXR - Single portable AP chest radiograph is compared to [**2202-4-6**] and demonstrates no significant difference.
Again demonstrated are healing right-sided rib fractures and a mottled appearance to the right clavicle.
No free air under the diaphragms.
No evidence for pulmonary opacification.
HAND (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) LEFT PORT  [**2202-4-24**] 1:31 PM There are no radiographic findings to suggest osteomyelitis in the left hand.
Diffuse vascular calcifications are present.
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT  [**2202-4-26**] 11:01 AM IMPRESSION: No evidence of right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (ejection fraction 20-30 percent) secondary to akinesis and fibrosis of the inferior and posterior walls, with at least mild hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Tissue velocity  imaging demonstrates an e' of <0.08m/s c/w an elevated left ventricular filling pressure (>12mmHg).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No  vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2202-2-4**], no major change is evident.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**6-/2502**]) immediately if          sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this patient's isolate.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 79y/o with h/o CAD, CHF20%, AD, CHF EF 20%, s/p CABG x2, DM, HTN, afib, multiple myeloma who recently started on velcade/decadron tx on [**2202-4-20**], and also was noted to have phlebitis at that time, now p/w sepsis.
A lactate was 4.1, 6% band, and requiring levophed for hypotension.
He did have a small plebitis on his left hand but this was unlikely the source of his infection.
ID was consulted, given AICD present in setting of MRSA sepsis.
SOB: The patient has a h/o CHF with EF20% and 4+MR with multiple recent admissions to [**Hospital1 18**] for CHF exacerbatons.
40mg IV Lasix was given initially, BP remained stable, however pt was only slightly negative.
The patient's chemotherapy/steroids were held because of the patients poor clinical status.
Pt had episode of AICD firing this admission.
Pt was restarted on Toprol and placed on tele after the AICD firing, with no further events.
CRI:  baseline 2.2-2.6; up to 3.5 here, then down to 1.8 --> likely had some element of acute on chronic renal failure in the setting of fluid overload and poor forward flow.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Rehab  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: MRSA sepsis CHF (systolic, EF 20%)  Secondary diagnoses: CAD AICD firing secondary to Vtach CRI   Discharge Condition: Stable.
You also had some bloody stools during this admission, and you should talke with your PCP about having [**Name Initial (PRE) **] colonoscopy as an outpatient.
