Pericardiocentesis   History of Present Illness: Patient is a 60F with ER negative, Her-2/neu positive breast cancer with mets to lymph node, pericardium, spleen, and bone who was recently receiving chemoradiation at which time she became short of breath and was found to have laryngeal edema and vocal cord paralysis.
She was admitted to the ICU where she had a trach placed, a chest tube placed for a large Left pleural efusion and a pericardial window for malignant pericardial effusion with a pulsus paradoxus of 15 to 20 prior to pericardiocentesis and window.
After resolution of these problems (see hospital course) , due to the progressive nature of her disease despite recent therapy with radiation to her left brachial plexus and xeloda and herceptin, she was transferred to the oncology service for additional chemotherapy with Adriamycin and Cytoxan.
Now s/p several chemotherapy regimens and radiation to left brachial plexus.
She has no children.
She reports smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day for 40 years without any other known toxic exposures.

Improvement to prior multifocal ground glass opacity and consolidation, but new right perihilar consolidations.
Temporal context and behavior of these findings are most suggestive of drug reaction, atypical edema, or pulmonary hemorrhage.
Early development of fibrotic changes in the upper lobes, supportive of drug toxicity scenario.
Small pericardial effusion, increased from prior exam.
Acute pulmonary embolism in the right lower lobe pulmonary artery extending into the segmental and subsegmental branches.
There is mild compression of the right lower lobe pulmonary artery superior to the filling defect secondary to right hilar lymphadenopathy.
As the size of the filling defect is larger than the narrowed lumen of the artery proximally, an element of thrombus is also likely present.
Subsegmental pulmonary emboli are also demonstrated within the right upper lobe and right middle lobe pulmonary arterial branches.
Stable appearance of the lungs with multiple areas of ground glass opacity and consolidation predominantly in the peripheral and peribronchial distribution.
No new areas of consolidation are demonstrated.
Stable bilateral axillary, hilar, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Unchanged appearance of low density lesion in the right love of the liver.
[**2137-10-2**]: LE US - IMPRESSION:  Bilateral lower extremity deep vein thromboses, right greater than left, age indeterminate.
[**2137-10-1**]: CT Chest without contast: 1)  Multifocal areas of ground glass and consolidation in peripheral and peribronchial distribution.
Rapid progression and development of these findings favors an inflammatory or infectious etiology such as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, or fungal infection.
Less likely considerations include vasculitis or drug reaction.
Rapid progression argues against a neoplastic process.
2)  New porta hepatis and celiac axis lymph nodes, and mild enlargement of right axillary and mediastinal lymph nodes.
3) Moderate loculated left pleural effusion, reduced in size in the interval.
4) Resolution of pericardial effusion.
[**2137-9-26**]: Portable Chest: Findings suggest improvement in the appearance of the chest since [**2137-9-25**] with persistent bilateral opacities.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Severe pericardial tamponade.
New moderate to large left pleural effusion with atelectasis.
New large pericardial effusion.
Narrowing of the bronchus intermedius and right middle lobe and lower lobe bronchus by the adjacent enlarged right hilar node.
Subtle ground-glass opacities and septal thickening likely secondary to congestive heart failure, although differential diagnosis includes atypical infection and drug reaction.
Discharge Labs: CBC: WBC-5.0 ; Hct-25.7 (before transfusion 1U PRBCs) ; PLT - 45 Chem: Na-140 ; K-3.7 ; Cl-104 ; HCO3-28 ; BUN-6 ; Cr-0.5 PT-20.8 ; INR-3.1 ; Fibrinogen-495  Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 60yo F with metastatic breast cancer who has received multiple chemotherapy regimens and radiation ([**8-22**]) for left brachial plexus tumor invasion with progression of disease.
On the morning of [**2137-9-15**], the patient presented to the hospital with acute SOB and was found to have laryngeal edema/vocal cord paralysis, a large pleural effusion and pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
Pericardial effusion/tamponade: The patient initially presented with hypotension, tachycardia, elevated JVP, and pulsus paradoxus.
Chest CT showed interval rapid accumulation of pericardial effusion over two weeks.
She deteriated hemodynamically with hypotension, increased HR, and elevated JVPs.
She underwent a left chest VATS, pleural biopsy, and pericardial window, and a pericardial drain was placed.
Immediately postop, the patient developed flash pulmonary edema and was diuresed overnight.
The patient has had no episodes of chest pain and had no JVD.
A recent CT performed on [**2137-10-9**] for a different indication (see below) revealed small pericardial effusion which was not seen on previous CT images.
The patient currently does not have a widened pulsus but has at baseline since her admission to the floor stable tachycardia (rate 100-115) and systolic blood pressures ranging from 90-115.
Patient's effusion will be followed with subsequent imaging and clinical exam by her oncologist on outpatient visits.
Shortness of breath: Patient's shortness of breath upon initial presentation was thought to be likely multi-factorial, with vocal cord paralysis/laryngeal edema as side effect of radiation, tumor obstruction of endotracheal tree, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, pulmonary edema, and PNA.
Given laryngeal edema and vocal cord paralysis, patient had an urgent trach placed on [**2137-9-15**].
Additionally, as initial CT showed a large left pleural effusion, a chest tube was placed on [**2137-9-15**], which drained more than 1.4L of serosanguinous fluid.
As the patient was demonstrating tamponade physiology with worsening hypotension the patient underwent pericardiocentesis for immediate relief followed by a left VATS procedure with a pericardial window.
After stabilization and transfer to the floor for additional chemotherapy given progression of disease, the patient's trach was noted to continue to put out large amounts of thick mucous and she was started on levofloxacin and flagyl empirically for aspiration pneumonia, although the patient was afebrile.
Despite therapy, the patient's secretions continued and chest film demonstrated worsening opacities bilaterally without improving oxygen requirements.
By this time, the patient had completed 6 days of Levo/Flagyl and antibiotics were held as it was thought that the patient's clinical improvement was likely secondary to fluid diuresis rather than an infectious etiology.
However, on [**2137-9-30**] A CT chest was performed which demonstrated multifocal areas of ground glass and consolidation in peripheral and peribronchial distribution with differential as discussed by radiology as possible cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, eosinophilic pneuomonia, or fungal infection.
The chest CT was discussed with the pulmonary team whose impression was that it more likely represented a nosocomial pneumonia, although the exact etiology of this alveolar consolidating process is not currently clear.
An official pulmonary consult was requested for help with management of this patient, with new ground glass appearing infiltrates.
Additionally, in the setting of working up the patient's hypoxia and ground glass infiltrates, the patient was noted to have new right lower leg edema.
As the patient had known DVT as well as hypoxia that was not improving, the patient underwent a CT of the chest which demonstrated RLL pulmonary artery PE with extension into the subsegmental arteries as well as additional smaller subsegmental PEs on the right side.
Despite all these events, the patient reports that she feels better although she is noted to still have ongoing productive cough.
The pulmonary team favored obtaining sputum cultures to see if a causative organsim could be identified before proceeding to Bronch.
Sputum cultures were performed and were found to be growing Acinetobaceter, multi-drug resistant, but sensitive to tobramycin and gentamycin.
The impression of the ID team was that given that the patient looked clinically well, was afebrile with stable oxygen requirements, they believed that the acinetobacter was likely a colonizer rather than a pathogenic organism and was therefore not initially treated.
However, the pulmonary team believed this was not the case and that this organism should be thought to be a cause of pulmonary infection given the CT findings and the fact that this is a virulent organism.
In the setting of this decision making process, the patient developed neutropenia secondary to her recent chemotherapy.
Repeat CT was suggested as well as starting cefepime 2gm q8hr with gentamycin 5mg/kg IV q24hr for a fever spike given the patient's known acinetobacter.
A repeat CT was performed which demonstrated resolution of previous ground glass opacities with development of a right hilar consolidation which was not thought to be infectious, but possibly representative of a drug effect vs. edema vs. bleed (per radiology report).
Even in the setting of neutropenia the patient did not develop fevers or have worsening pulmonary status.
Currently, the patient is no longer neutropenic, remains afebrile, but still does have stable amonts of thick yellow sputum production.
Metastatic Breast Ca: The patient was admitted with known metastatic breast cancer to the LN, bones, and spleen.
The patient is aware of her poor prognosis but wishes to try further chemotherapy.
The patient's course was complicated by neutropenia as described above, but did not develop fever's during her course of neutropenia.
The patient had a pan-cytopenia secondary to myelosuppression requiring transfusion of 1U of PRBC for Hct of 23.5 with appropriate bump but did not require any platelet transfusions.
She has guaiac negative stool and is thought to have anemia secondary to her myelosuppression.
Diarrhea: Patient developed diarrhea during her hospital course.
She had C. Diff sent x 4, all of which were negative and the patient has remained afebrile with all stool cultures negative.
The patient previously was having 3 to 5 loose bowel movements a day, but currently the frequency and severity of her diarrhea is decreasing.
Thrombocytopenia: patient was found to be thromocytopenic and HIT Ab was positive.
In the setting of myelosuppression secondary to chemotherapy, the patient was noted to develop thrombocytopenia with a nadir on [**2137-10-9**] of 33 with now increasing counts.
The patient did not require any platelet transfusions and has not had any adverse bleeding events, even in the setting of thrombocytopenia and anti-coagulation for her DVT/PE.
Since then, the patient has had repeat video swallow which demonstrated patient was appropriate for house diet with thin liquids with no need for chin tuck or other such maneuvers.
