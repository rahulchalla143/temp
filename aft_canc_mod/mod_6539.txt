The lesion was subsequently biopsied by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the pathology was consistent with anaplastic astrocytoma.
There is no evidence of residual tumor.
There are postoperative changes, including intraparenchymal hemorrhage along the surgical pathway and surrounding edema are noted.
The fluid signal intensity within the left lateral ventricle is higher on FLAIR than in the right lateral ventricle, this may represent a component of hemorrhage within the ventricle.
Dependent material is noted within the left lateral ventricle, apparently representing a hematocrit level related to intraventricular hemorrhage.
A small amount of blood is present dependent within the left lateral ventricle.
Previously noted shift of the anterior falx and the septum pellucidum to the right has slightly decreased.
There is persistent opacification of the right posterior ethmoid air cell.
There is new fluid in the right sphenoid sinus and new aerosolized secretions in the left sphenoid sinus, which may be related to the presence of a nasogastric tube.
IMPRESSION: Expected evolution of postoperative changes, with slightly decreased shift of normally midline structures to the right and slightly decreased density of blood along the path of the left frontal ventriculostomy.
Slightly decreased frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
She was noted to have a tremor in her lower extremities but this was not felt to be seizure activity.
ID felt that no medication needed to be given.
Her neuro exam had improved to near baseline with the exception of her RUE weakness ([**4-27**]).
