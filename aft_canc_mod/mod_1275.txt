During this hospital stay, she developed a fever and was initialy treated with Cefepime for suspected PNA.
Antibiotics were stopped after culture data returned negative and CXR showed no pneumonia.
She also developed sinus tachycardia during this hospitalization with rates in the 120s, for which she was not started on medication.
Per the patient's son, she had been taking Diltiazem 180 mg daily until one month prior, at which time this medication was stopped secondary to hypotension.
Yesterday, the patient reportedly had a 10-second episode of non-responsiveness when sitting on the toilet.
Her son states that she often has episodes of lightheadedness when standing or sitting from a lying position.
She became tachycardic after 1L NS to 150s, so she was given Adenosine, without effect.
On the floor, the patient denies pain, shortness of breath, diarrhea, or constipation.

Again demonstrated bilateral hilar enlargement with obscuration of the left AP window, which is relatively stable.
Dense nodular calcification is again seen within the mid and inferior aspect of the mediastinum, correlating to calcified node seen on prior CT from [**2137-7-3**].
The lungs are grossly clear without focal consolidation, sizeable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
No acute intracranial process.
Please note that MRI is more sensitive for acute ischemia, if there is clinical concern.
Significant bilateral subcortical periventricular white matter hypodensity, which could be likely due to chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
Essentially unchanged from one month ago except increased right pleural effusion (still small), trace left effusion.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia with rate of 128.
No ST T segment abnormalities appreciated.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 80 yo woman with h/o DLBCL s/p Chemo and Radiation in [**2133**], hypertension, and hypothyroidism, who presented with failure to thrive, two recent syncopal episodes and persistent sinus tachycardia with rates into 140s.
Each of the problems addressed during this hospitalization are described in detail below:  Tachycardia: On admission, the patient was noted to be in sinus tachycardia with HRs into 140s.
The patient's blood pressure would not tolerate further increase in Dilitiazem dose.
The patient had no episodes of chest pain or palpitations at any point during her hospitalization.
She had mildly elevated Troponins (Peak 0.09), and then trended down, which were likely explained by her tachycardia.
She was monitored on Telemetry throughout her hospitalization and had no evidence of arrhythmia, other than a few episodes of PVCs.
Pt has had extensive tachycardia workup at previous rotation, all negative, and thought to be tachycardic primary given history of malignancy.
If tachycardia worsens, could consider symptomatic transfusion of RBCs.
Syncope: The patient had 2 recent episodes of syncope while on a commode, where she was noted to be unresponsive for [**10-4**] seconds.
Most likely orthostatic given reduced PO intake for days prior to admission, but may also represent a vasovagal episode given happened on a commode.
While we could not exlude cardiac cause, there was no episodes on Telemetry at any point during this hospitalization that could explain the syncopal episodes.
There were no further episodes of syncope during this hospitalization and the pt.
denied dizziness / lightheadedness throughout.
Productive Cough, Rhonchi on Lung Exam, Low Grade fevers: On presentation, the patient reported a chronic productive cough with brown sputum.
The patient had several episodes of low-grade fever.
Blood cultures were send, but yielded no bacteria.
CXRs showed no evidence of PNA.
The patient's cough has decreased and her breathing appears less labored than before.
The patient had another episode of low-grade fever to 100.9 the day prior to discharge.
CXR was performed and showed no evidence of PNA.
noted to have acute worsening of her chronic hyponatremia.
The etiology of patient's SIADH is unclear, but may represent pain vs. acute lung process vs. neoplastic process.
Anemia: On admission, the patient noted to have worsening normocytic anemia.
Recent Iron Studies were consistent with Anemia of Chronic Disease.
However, the patient was also noted to have low vitamin B12 levels and was started on Cyanocobalamin.
At the time of discharge, Hct is 22.1, but the patient continues to have no symptomes associated with anemia.
It is important to continue monitoring patient's Hematocrit regularly upon discharge and consider transfusion if Hct drops furthur or if pt continues to be tachycardic >110bpm.
Hypothyroidism: The patient was noted to have elevated TSH of 8.4.
However, free T4 was 1.1 and total was T4 5.4 (both within normal limits), which may represent subclinical hypothyroidism.
Medications on Admission: Tylenol with Codeine (300mg/30mg) q6h prn for pain Albuterol 90 mcg HFA q4-6 prn Levothyroxine 100 mcg daily on Mon-Sat Mirtazapine 7.5 mg qhs Tylenol 325-650 mg q6h prn for pain Calcium Carbonate-Vitamin D3 (500/200 mg) [**Hospital1 **] Vitamin D3 400 mg daily Colace 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] prn for constipation   Discharge Medications: 1.
