History of Present Illness: 84 year old man with diabetes mellitus II, atrial fibrillation, MGUS, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, presenting at Dr. [**Name (NI) 10362**] behest with migratory polyarthralgias, lethargy/fatigue, recent right ear pain, and falling to knees x2.
He was in good health until the past 2 months, when he developed LE weakness and arthralgias.
However, for the past few days the pain has resumed in his wrist (associated with slight hand swelling) and shoulders, among other joints.
Ear pain is notable on eating and drinking, which he thinks has reduced his fluid intake over the last days.
He was seen by rheumatology last week, and his diagnosis remained unclear despite extensive labs, which were notable for monoclonal gammopathy with positive urine M-spike.
Of note, he also has Bence-[**Doctor Last Name **] proteinurea and anemia.
On ROS, he also notes decreased urination over the past day, noting that he is drinking less because it worsens his ear pain.
In the ED, exam showed good strength/tone, no saddle anesthesia and normal rectal tone, although guaiac positive.

IMAGING CXR [**12-31**], wet read: continued pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions, overall stable in extent since the prior.
Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing there is no significant change.
11/21 [**12-9**] [**12-8**]  ECHO [**12-27**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No good evidence for active tuberculosis.
No cavitary lung lesions.
Several small lung nodules could be post-inflammatory lesions, unusually small for active pulmonary Wegener's granulomatosis, but if the patient's clinical situation is unstable, I would repeat a chest CT in four weeks to monitor them, and I would not be surprised if most or all of them disappear.
A nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion and tiny left pleural effusion have developed since [**Month (only) **], small pericardial effusion is of indeterminate age, but not hemodynamically significant.
Multiple right rib fractures are well healed.
-Associated actinic keratosis, extending to a peripheral specimen margin.
No hemodynamic evidence of tamponade physiology.
Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Mild right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
Elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure consistent with moderate left ventricular diastolic heart failure.
No focal lytic or sclerotic lesion identified.
Multiple pulmonary findings consistent with prior granulomatous disease such as tuberculosis.
Low lying bowel could represent bowel containing inguinal hernia.
Normal-sized kidneys without hydronephrosis; echogenic cortex suggests the presence of diffuse parenchymal renal disease.
Similar appearance of a bladder wall hypertrophy and enlarged prostate.
Trace perihepatic ascites.

Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY  84 year old man with DM, Afib, smoldering multiple myeloma here with migratory polyarthralgias, lethargy/fatigue, right ear pain, and found to have acute on chronic renal failure, now known to be C-ANCA positive with biopsy proven glomerulonephritis consistent with Wegener's granulomatosis with primarily renal manifestation.
BY PROBLEM Acute on chronic renal failure Anasarca Initiation of Dialysis   The patient was found to have an acute on chronic renal failure that had been pre-existing due to the patient's diabetes.
Subsequent studies found the patient to have C-ANCA positive pauci-immune glomerulonephritis proven on kidney biopsy, consistent with Wegener's granulomatosis.
However, subsequently his renal function began to deteriorate again and he developed generalized anasarca with volume overload and dyspnea.
Deconditioning   The patient was proximally weak, primarily in the legs and was thus discharged to a rehabilitation facility at the reccomendation of PT  Wegener's granulomatosis with primary renal manifestation, possibly Cytoxan-Resistant   constellation of musculoskeletal complaints, ear pain and renal failure was consistent Wegener's granulomatosis that was diagnosed with C-ANCA positive titer and kidney biopsy.
The patient's symptoms with the exception of renal failure largely resolved with treatment.
Pericardial effusion  the patient was found to have a large pericardial effusion on echo and a friction rub, which was thought to be uremic with possible hemorrhagic component given supratherapeutic INR on admission.
By discharge this had largely resolved clinically and by echo with treatment of patient's kidney injury and Wegener's.
Skeletal survey revealed no lytic lesions.
Significance unclear - possible that antibody of MM is pathogenic antibody for Wegener's - at least conceivable.
F/u free K/L light chains in serum are mildly elevated, but the ratio is nearly preserved.
Atrial fibrillation   Admission EKG suggestive of aflutter without rapid ventricular rate.
He was placed on a heparin drip when he went to the MICU, but had several supratherapeutic PTT's and developed a GI bleed.
He also had several episodes of RVR, which were controlled with diltiazem as needed.
He was not placed on a standing nodal [**Doctor Last Name 360**] given his history of sick sinus syndrome.
Thrombocytopenia  the patient's platelets began to slowly drop after admission to the MICU and starting of heparin drip.
HIT antibody pending.
The patient was started on RIPE, however subsequent testing including quantiferon gold and genetic probe on smear were negative for mycobacterium tuberculosis.
The patient opted to forego MAC therapy and the treatment of his latent TB was discontinued secondary to hepatoxicity  GI bleed   the patient developed a GI bleed with maroon stools, BRBPR and melena on [**12-31**] after discharge from MICU.
Subsequent stools demonstrated a clearing of blood and stable hematocrit while off heparin.
The bleeding was thought to be secondary to radiation proctitis for which the patient has a history of and had received laser photocoagulation.
Anemia   Chronic, close to baseline of high 20s to low 30s.
See above for history of GI bleed.

Additionally, you have an infection called "MAC" that need only be treated should it give you symptoms.
