Admission Date:  [**2120-11-15**]       Discharge Date:  [**2121-1-11**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of rectal cancer who was initially admitted to the surgery service at [**Hospital1 190**] on [**2120-11-15**] for low anterior resection for carcinoma, with placement of a colostomy and omental flap.
Her initial postoperative course was complicated by necrosis of the omental pouch and a resultant prolonged post-op ileus.
Multiple CT scans revealed no evidence of obstruction and her ileus was attributed to inflammation and irritation from the necrotic omentum.
On [**12-18**], the patient was found to be less responsive with increasing respiratory effort and arterial blood gas revealed a PH of 7.22, PCO2 100 and PO2 84 on three liters of oxygen.
The patient was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and was transferred to the MICU.
From a respiratory standpoint the patient was extubated on the following day but required re-intubation after three days secondary to increasing secretions and need for pulmonary toilet.
This was attributed to volume overload secondary to possible diastolic dysfunction as well as a component of COPD.
From a GI standpoint CT of the abdomen on [**12-16**] revealed a communication between Hartmann's pouch and the peritoneal cavity with an abdominal fluid collection consistent with abscess.
From an ID standpoint, [**4-24**] blood culture bottles from [**12-5**] and [**12-6**] grew coag negative staph which was treated with a 10 day course of Vancomycin.
As mentioned previously, the patient had sputum from [**12-18**] with MRSA which had been treated with 10 days of Vancomycin.
The infectious disease service was curb sided and felt that the patient was most likely colonized, particularly since she had no evidence of pneumonia.
From a cardiac standpoint there was concern about volume overload secondary to diastolic dysfunction.
She had several episodes of atypical chest pain during her stay in the MICU and was ruled out for MI multiple times.
During her MICU stay, the patient also had frequent episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
The decision was made to not anticoagulate her given her recent surgery and the risk for bleeding.
In addition, the atrial fibrillation is thought to be secondary to other acute processes that are occurring in this patient.
There was one episode of a self extubation attempt.
Hypertension with question diastolic dysfunction.
In general she was sad but responded to questioning with nodding, unable to speak secondary to recent extubation.
Neck was supple without bruits or lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular exam, regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Respiratory exam, patient had decreased breath sounds bilaterally with soft bibasilar rales.
Extremities were warm without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
She had a chest x-ray from [**1-6**] which revealed interval improvement in upper zone redistribution with a small left pleural effusion and residual left lower lobe collapse with an opacity in the retrocardiac area most likely atelectasis.
She had a CT of the abdomen from [**12-16**] which revealed a collection of fluid and air within the abdomen with no identifiable Hartmann's pouch.
She had a CT on [**12-25**] which revealed a collection of fluid and air within the abdomen consistent with an intra-abdominal abscess.
She had a TTE on [**12-19**] which revealed an ejection fraction of 60%, left atrium mildly dilated, left ventricular thickness and cavity size normal, RV thickness and size normal, moderate mitral annular calcification and 1+ MR. Microbiologic data:  The patient had a sputum from [**1-4**] which grew 4+ pseudomonas, pansensitive.
[**12-22**] sputum MRSA.
[**12-18**] sputum MRSA.
She had a catheter tip from [**12-29**], no growth.
Urine from [**12-27**] revealed no growth.
From a pulmonary standpoint we emphasized chest PT, aggressive pulmonary toilet and incentive spirometer.
From an infectious disease standpoint, the patient completed a 10 day course of Vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia and MSSA sepsis as well as a 14 day course of Fluconazole for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29361**] fungemia.
The patient remained afebrile as well.
The patient did not have any clear evidence before pneumonia but she did remain mildly hypoxic with an oxygen requirement and was noted to have an occasional cough.
We discussed the patient with the infectious disease team and they did not feel that double coverage for pseudomonas was indicated in this case.
The patient remained stable from a GI standpoint.
She did have several episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation which were very responsive to 10 mg of IV Lopressor.
During these episodes she remained normotensive and asymptomatic.
She denied chest pain or any other symptoms at these times.
From a pump standpoint there was a question of a diastolic dysfunction in this patient in the MICU.
The patient was very PEEP dependent and despite her normal echo, it was felt that she was fluid overloaded secondary to diastolic dysfunction.
Upon her arrival to us, we were concerned about her elevated bicarbonate level which we attributed to metabolic alkalosis secondary to contraction.
Her oxygen saturations continued to improve with a decreasing oxygen requirement.
In terms of her coronary artery disease, the patient did not complain of any chest pain and had no evidence of ischemia.
From a psychiatry standpoint, the patient was noted to have a profound depression.
We requested bedside swallow to evaluate her aspiration risk.
The patient was noted to have clear evidence of aspiration.
We felt that the patient requires an acute level of rehab.
Necrosis of the omental flap with abdominal abscess draining into rectal stump.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on Amiodarone and Lopressor.
