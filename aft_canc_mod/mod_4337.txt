No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.
Central venous catheter remains with the catheter tip at the superior cavoatrial junction.
However, given the history of neutropenic fever, if the patient has any clinical symptoms, a CT should be obtained for further evaluation given the increased sensitivity.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2175-9-1**] 1:19 AM REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Acute onset of chest pain for three hours.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No active pulmonary disease.
IMPRESSION: No active pulmonary disease.
A right internal jugular catheter has been inserted and terminates at the level of the right atrium or junction of the right atrium and inferior vena cava.
A right internal jugular catheter has been pulled back and now terminates at the level of the cavoatrial junction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2175-7-3**] no diagnostic interim change.
The slight ST segment elevation in the inferior and lateral leads is early repolarization and not likely to represent ischemia in this patient's age group.
FINDINGS: Within the lung bases, no concerning lesions or pleural effusions are seen.
Several loops of collapsed bowel in the left upper quadrant are incompletely assessed; however, no surrounding inflammation is seen.
A hypodensity in the left kidney is incompletely characterized; however, likely represents a simple cyst.
Retroaortic left renal vein, accessory right renal artery noted.
No evidence of cholecystitis on this study.
No free air is seen.
A small amount of free fluid is present within the pelvis.
A calcification in the right lower quadrant is not clearly localized and may be related to the right adnexa, particularly on the coronal reformats.
No lymphadenopathy is identified.
No concerning osseous lesion is seen.
Incidental note is made of advanced degenerative changes in the left hip joint.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Radiology Report CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2175-9-6**] 9:49 AM TECHNIQUE: Helical CT acquisition from top of the lungs to upper abdomen without intravenous contrast with multiplanar reformations.
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is a left chest wall Port-A-Cath with the tip of the catheter terminating at the cavoatrial junction.
Small amount of residual thymic tissue is present.
There is no mediastinal, axillary adenopathy.
The superior segment of the right lower lobe demonstrates a new broad based subpleural nodular opacity measuring 1.4 X 0.7 cm (4:76), this could represent focal atelectasis, however in the right clinical infection is not excluded.
There is new diffuse septal thickening, small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with bibasilar compressive atelectasis.
New diffuse septal thickening likely due to hydrostatic edema in the setting of new pleura effusions.
New dependent right lower lobe opacity, likely focal nodular atelectasis and less likely an early focus of pneumonia.
Unchanged small pulmonary nodules.
No specific findings to explain left chest wall pain.
Please note given non-contrast nature of this study, vascular etiology for pain cannot be evaluated.
There is a 1.7 x 1.5 x 2.5 cm hemangioma in the right lobe of the liver.
No other lesions are identified.
There is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.
There is no gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid.
There is no evidence of free fluid.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
2.5-cm hemangioma in the right lobe of the liver.
She remained afebrile and asymptomatic for several days before spiking a fever to 104.5 and becoming hypotensive while on multiple antibiotics.
# Neutropenic Fever: She had a fever to 100.4 in clinic the day of admission without any clear symptoms pointing to focus of infection.
Physical exam was unremarkable except for mild tenderness to palpation in epigastric region and LUQ without rebound or guarding to suggest an acute abdomen.
She had a previous episode of febrile neutropenia during induction that was thought secondary to colitis and resolved after treatment with Vancomycin, Cefepime, Flagyl, and Micafungin.
She remained afebrile for several days until [**2175-9-2**], when she spiked a fever overnight.
She continued to have fevers on [**2175-9-3**], and Micfungin was added.
She became hypotensive despite fluids and was sent to the ICU, where she received IV fluids, blood, and pressors for a brief period.
Her condition improved after switching from Cefepime to Meropenem and starting Vancomycin PO for a positive C diff assay sent on [**2175-9-2**].
She was transfered back to the floor on [**2175-9-4**] and remained afebrile until discharge.
Her WBC count was elevated to 21.2, but slowly decreased over the next few days.
She was discharged on Vancomycin 125 mg PO Q6H for continued treatment of her C diff infection.
# Hypotension: She became hypotensive on [**2175-9-3**] and was initially managed with fluid boluses on the floor.
# Coagulopathy: Her INR increased from 1.2 to 1.8 during her episode of high fever and hypotension.
# Chest Pain: She complained of an episode of chest pain overnight from [**2175-8-31**] to [**2175-9-1**].
An EKG was obtained which showed no evidence of ischemia.
She complained of mild vague chest pain at several other points during her stay without a clear etiology identified, but likely muskuloskeletal or GI.
# Transaminitis: On the day of discharge, her labs showed a mild increase in her transaminases with ALT 78 and AST 100.
She had a slight increase in LDH from 233 to 269 and her AlkPhos and Bilirubin were unchanged.
She had an ultrasound of her liver and gallbladder which showed cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis, and a 2.5 cm hemangioma in the right lobe of the liver, unchanged from a previous ultrasound.
# AML M4-Eo: Diagnosed [**2175-6-30**] after presenting to ED with sore throat, dysphagia, and neck swelling.
No residual disease seen on BMB from [**2175-8-2**].
On admission, she was on HiDAC C1D19 with recent nadir.
Her ANC began to increase on [**2175-9-1**] and she was no longer neutropenic by [**2175-9-3**].
Her anemia was improving without additional transfusions by the time of discharge.
# Infection Prophylaxis: Prior to admission, she was taking Bactrim, Acyclovir, and Fluconazole for infection prophylaxis.
She has a history of a sacral HSV rash during induction that resolved with Acyclovir treatment.
Her Bactrim and Acyclovir were held on discharge due to an increase in her transaminases on the day of discharge.
# Latent Syphilis: She has a history of latent syphilis that was previously evaluated and treated with Penicillin IV x14 days at a prior admission.
She showed no evidence of active infection during this admission.
Medications on Admission: Acyclovir 400 mg PO Q8H Sulfameth/Trimethoprim SS 1 TAB PO/NG DAILY Levofloxacin 500 mg PO DAILY Fluconazole 200 mg PO Q24H Lorazepam 0.5-1 mg PO Q4H PRN nausea Ondansetron HCl 8 mg PO Q8H PRN nausea Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q24H Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID PRN constipation Senna 1 TAB PO QHS PRN constipation  Discharge Medications: 1.

Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO four times a day as needed for pain for 4 days: Do not drive or operate heavy machinery while on this medication as it may make you sleepy.
Disp:*20 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Critical Care Systems  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Neutropenic fevers Clostridium difficile infection  Secondary Diagnoses: Acute Myelogenous Leukemia   Discharge Condition: All vital signs stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for neutropenic fevers.
Since these cells help fight bacteria and viruses, infections during this time can be very dangerous and life threatening.
During your stay, you briefly developed high fevers and low blood pressure due to an infection, and had a brief stay in the Intensive Care Unit.
The antibiotics were stopped slowly, and you did not develop any new fevers or concerning symptoms.
During your stay, you were also diagnosed with an infection in your intestines called Clostridium difficile (C. diff).
This infection was probably the cause of the abdominal pain you had.
This type of infection is common in patients who have been hospitalized for long periods of time and who have received many antibiotics.
START: Vancomycin Oral Liquid 125 mg by mouth every 6 hours  You were started on a medication called Omeprazole to help with some of the abdominal discomfort you have been having.
START: Omeprazole 20 mg daily  Several of your liver enzymes were elevated slightly today.
You should meet with your primary oncologist, Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], after discharge to discuss your upcoming lymphoma treatments.
