Interval improvement in degree of acute-to-subacute patchy ground-glass opacification with accompanying septal thickening with intervening normal areas of lung on a background of unchanged to slightly progressed subpleural interstitial abnormality with traction bronchiectasis, but no discrete honeycombing.
In total this pattern is suspicious for acute interstitial pneumonia on a background of interstitial lung disease.
PCP infection superimposed on chronic interstitial lung disease is an alternate consideration.
It is unlikely to reflect pulmonary edema or bacterial infection.
Interval decrease in degree of lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum and hila which is likely reactive for the ongoing interstitial process.
Nasogastric tube tents the stomach and could be withdrawn by approximately 1 cm.
EEG This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study due to diffuse background slowing and attenuation with intermittent brief runs of frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).
These findings are indicative of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction of non-specific etiology.
No epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures are present.
Note is made of an irregularly irregular rapid cardiac rhythm and occasional wide complex premature cardiac beats.
Interval development of moderate bibasilar right greater than left likely atelectasis with otherwise little change in the degree of interstitial abnormality presumed to reflect acute exacerbation of chronic interstitial lung disease.
Unchanged Ascending aortic dilatation 3.
Decreased mediastinal adenopathy.
No evidence of acute vascular territorial ischemia, though no dedicated perfusion sequence was requested or performed.
No flow-limiting stenosis, significant mural irregularity, aneurysm larger than 2 mm, or dissection of the cranial vessels.
Complete opacification of the mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities, and aerosolized secretions in the sphenoid air cell, likley related to prolonged intubation and supine positioning.
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is better seen in prior CT from [**5-18**].
There is no pneumothorax.
Patient has known chronic interstitial lung disease, superimposed there is increasing diffuse density of the interstitial markings.
This suggests again exacerbation of the chronic interstitial lung disease, less likely edema.
There is no evidence of acute or subacute intracranial process, specifically no diffusion abnormalities are demonstrated to indicate acute ischemic event.
Possible lacunar ischemic change versus prominent perivascular space noted of the right basal ganglia, unchanged since the prior head CT. Slightly prominent ventricles and sulci, possibly age-related and indicating mild cortical volume loss.
Unchanged bilateral opacities noted of the mastoid air cells, likely related with prolonged intubation.

# Respiratory Failure - At VA pt initially presented with symptoms consistent with viral URI, but given severe underlying ILD, he rapidly decompensated requiring mechanical ventilation.
Pt had numerous barriers to extubation on presentation including high PEEP requirements, over-sedation and lack of resolution of his disease state.
A tracheostomy was performed without complication.
He remained ventilator dependent alternating between PSV and CMV ventilation, requiring high cuff pressures likely due to anatomical dilatation of the trachea.
Patient was placed on Cefepime for [**Hospital1 16630**] (MDR Klebsiella sensitive to Meropenem/cefepime).
Several episodes of emesis complicated the patients respiratory status on [**2168-5-26**].
# Altered Mental Status:  On admission, pt was intubated and heavily sedated on propofol with RASS neg [**1-1**].
Reportedly, pt's mental status was normal prior to intubation at VA.  As per VA discharge summary, there was no reason for pt to have experienced an anoxic injury throughout hospital course.
Neurology was consulted and felt that initial exam was consistent with global encephalopathy secondary to being chronically sedated on fentanyl, versed and propofol in a person with a large body habitus.
72 hrs of continuous EEG monitoring was done and did not show any epileptiform activity but did show moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction of non-specific etiology.
Mild improvement noted [**5-23**] with localizing tactile stimuli and tracking staff across room.
An MRI was performed that revealed no acute/subacute intracranial process, potential evidence small vessel disease.
The patient has been intermittently responsive since [**2168-5-24**] responding to some simple commands such as finger squeezing and occasional head nodding yes/no.
His prolonged period of unresponsiveness could be due to patient having a large volume of distribution (large body habitus), with sedatives now wearing off.
Diffuse infiltrates on repeat CT, in addition to worsening basilar atelectasis.
Sputum growing MDR Klebsiella sensitive to [**Last Name (un) 2830**] and cefepime.
Concerns about aspiration after episodes of emesis on [**5-26**].
# BACTEREMIA - Staph.
Blood culture from [**5-19**] revealed no growth.
\  # Polymyalgia rheumatica  - Pt was treated with methylprednisolone x3 days at VA.  Was previously treated with prednisone 15mg PO daily, but was never given PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
