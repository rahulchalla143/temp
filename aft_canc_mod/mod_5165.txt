Structural allograft.
Excision of soft tissue mass in the posterior     cervical region.
He has no children.

He has no children.
His respiratory rate is 30 HEENT:  His pupils are pinpoint, equal, round, and minimally reactive.
NECK:  Patient in C collar CARDIAC:  His heart is regular, without murmurs.
THORAX:  Symmetrical, without lesions or masses.

There does not appear to be evidence of cord compression, however, evaluation of the thecal sac is limited due to overlying streak artifact from the orthopedic hardware.
CXR: Continued consolidation/collapse of the left lower lobe with a small left pleural effusion.
Linear atelectasis within the right lung base.
A 2.4-cm mass in the mid to lower esophagus consistent with patient's known esophageal carcinoma with periesophageal lymphadenopathy and left paraaortic lymphadenopathy.
10 mm hypodense lesion in the right adrenal, which likely corresponds to the FDG-avid area on the PET CT of [**2120-6-24**].
Hypodense lesion in the left lobe of the liver, which is too small to characterize.
Multiple small pulmonary nodules in the right middle lobe, which are less than 5 mm and a followup CT should be performed in three months given history of esophageal cancer.
Bibasilar atelectasis with bilateral tiny effusions.
Coronary artery calcifications.
U/S lower extremities: Stable size of hematomas in the laminectomy bed and in the posterior subcutaneous soft tissues compared to [**2120-9-6**].
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Views are technically suboptimal for assessment of regurgitation .
EKG: Probable sinus tachycardia with multiple atrial premature complexes - may be multifocal atrial tachycardia Ventricular premature complex Modest nonspecific low amplitude T waves.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 y/o man with history of metastatic esophageal cancer, diabetes, asthma discharged today from ortho spine service after cervical surgeries leading to ultimate fusion of multiple cervical vertebrae after fall and fracture of same on [**8-28**], re-admitted with hypoxemic resp failure.
He was initially trated with vancomycin and aztreonam which was changed to levofloxacin on [**9-9**] for sputum Serratia and gram+ cocci pneumonia and left lower lobe collapse.
He required intubation in the operating room due to his cervical fracture.
He had a large amount of secretions and required bronchoscopy.
He tolerated extubation [**9-11**] and stated his desires not to be re-intubated or resuscitated if he decompensated.
Since being transferred to the floor, he has had no respiratory distress, vitals have been stable and he has been afebrile.
Once on admission and a second time after a transient episode of fluid unresponsive hypotension that required pressors.
It is unclear what the etiology of his hypotension was, but likely from hypovolemia.
His HCT was low but remained stable and he was found to have a chronic disease anemia.
Altered mental status on admission appeared to be medication related and resolved the morning after intubation once propofol was discontinued and has not returned since.
Esophageal cancer: He has metastatic cancer and is followed by an oncologist.
Nutrition: He failed a speech and swallow evaluation.
Hip pain:  On the day of discharge, pt developed some soft tissue pain in the right hip not consistent with fracture with full range of motion and walking with assistance.
This pain responded well to Tylenol.
