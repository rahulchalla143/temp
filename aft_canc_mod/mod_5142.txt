History of Present Illness: Patient is a 78yoF with HTN, DM2, CAD s/p CABG admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] [**2125-2-22**] for shortness of breath.
The states that she first noted feeling short of breath on the night PTA.
There was no CP, palpitations.
She had a recent admission for syncope at [**Hospital1 112**] thought to be secondary to orthostasis from BP meds.
There was no evidence of arrhythmia.
In the ICU, her respiratory distress was thought to be secondary to a COPD exacerbation.
Endocrine evaluated patient and recommended further studies to determine if pt has thyroiditis vs. [**Doctor Last Name **] dz.
Pt also went into rapid atrial fibrillation hemodynamically stable overnight to HR 150s, improved with verapamil.
Past Medical History: Rib fractures T8-11 and T8-10 transverse processes noted during syncope admission HTN CAD s/p CABG '[**16**], stents [**11-27**] PVD hyperlipidemia nephrotic syndrome [**1-25**] DM2/HTN MNG stable on US OA in R knee and CMC DM: retinopathy, nephropathy CRI baseline cr 1.2 [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 66567**]  Social History: Lives alone and has home VNA.
No significant smoking history, occasional tobacco.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T 98.1 p 88 bp 191/48 rr 20  97% RA Gen: A+Ox3, anxious elderly AA woman, in NAD HEENT: JVP flat, +enlarged thyroid bilaterally L>R, without nodules, mild tenderness to palpation, no LAD Lungs: minimal crackles bilaterally Heart: s1 s2 no m/r/g Abd: soft nt/nd +bs Ext: no c/c/e Neuro: non-focal.
If there is persistent clinical concern, the study may be repeated again 6 weeks after IV contrast administration.
Nasal Aspirate: Rapid Respiratory Viral Antigen Test (Final [**2125-2-22**]):  Positive for respiratory viral antigens except RSV.
CXR [**2-22**]: no pulm edema, no pna, no pneumothorax .
Multiple acute left-sided rib fractures and fractures of the transverse processes of the 8 through 11th thoracic vertebra on the left.
No pneumothorax seen.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic dissection.
Heterogeneous enlargement of both lobes of the thyroid gland resulting in symmetrical compression and coronal narrowing of the trachea reduced to 9 mm in coronal dimension at the thoracic inlet compared to 19 mm in transverse dimension below this level.
Trace left pleural effusion.
Dependent centrilobular nodules in the left upper lobe posteriorly most likely due to an aspiration or small airways infection.
Additional 2-3 mm diameter left upper lobe nodule laterally is nonspecific but likely benign.
If warranted clinically, a one year followup CT could be performed to ensure stability or resolution and to fully exclude a small lung cancer.
Statistically, this is most likely due to an adenoma.
CXR [**2-21**]: No CHF, pneumothorax or focal consolidations.
Stress MIBI [**2125-2-15**]: mild reversible defect interpreted to be c/w scar.
LV EF 57% no WMA.
Echo [**10-28**] @ [**Hospital1 112**]: EF 60% no WMA, diastolic dysfxn .

has no known COPD history.
+ influenza A.  CT trachea showed evidence of small airway infection, and significant narrowing of the trachea at the level of the thoracic inlet by the patient's goiter.
SOB unlikely due to compression by trachea, since Pt.
now improved without intervention.
Recommmendation from IP was for repeat tracheal CT in [**2-24**] weeks; if there is an acute change, Pt may need to undergo rigid bronchoscopy and stenting.
Also would recommend PFTs as outpatient once pt recovers to clarify COPD issue.
## AFib: Pt had new onset rapid AF, hemodynamically stable.
Likely secondary to pulmonary pathology/influenza.
If AFib continues, Pt.
Thyroiditis vs. [**Doctor Last Name 933**] dz.
Likely demand ischemia in setting of bronchospasm and rapid tachycardia.
## DM: continue lantus 25U qhs and ISS while in house, diabetic diet.
has had poor glycemic control while in house, both hypo and hyperglycemia, possibly related to illness and change in PO intake.
reports that she is allergic to sugar substitutes and can only eat a regular diet.
## Leukocytosis w/ left shift: Likely secondary to high dose steroids, will monitor.

Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q8H (every 8 hours): may use more often if you are wheezing or feel short of breath.

If you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms, please call Dr.[**Name (NI) 66569**] office or return to the hospital.
You are taking two medications, methimazole and prednisone, which will need to be adjusted based upon labs that are still pending, to determine what is causing your thyroid disease.
