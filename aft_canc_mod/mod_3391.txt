MRI Brain: diffuse perivascular changes c/w chronic ischemic changes-v- MS-v- [**Month/Day/Year **] .
Signal abnormality within the T7 vertebral body with enhancing component extending into the epidural space at this level concerning for a neoplastic process.
Probable abnormal signal is seen within the cord at this level suggestive of edema.
Probable area of signal abnormality within the pons appears to be demonstrated on limited views, that in retrospect appears to be confirmed on the dedicated MRI brain.
It is likely an area of chronic infarction.
No paraaortic masses present.
Large prevascular and pretracheal lymph nodes, concerning for malignancy as described above.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, or infarction.
There are periventricular white matter hyperintensities suggesting chronic small vessel ischemia.
There is no abnormal enhancement after contrast administration.
Conclusion: Chronic small vessel ischemic changes, otherwise normal study.
Focal increased abnormal uptake in the T7 vertebral body consistent with osseous metastasis.
Degenerative change as above.
[**2101-1-12**] MRI HEAD FINDINGS: Since prior exam, there has been no significant interval change.
No new intracranial mass lesion, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, minor or major [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] territorial infarct is apparent.
Stable appearance of the multiple T2 hyperintense foci in the periventricular white matter suggestive of chronic microvascular infarcts, as well as the solitary left paracentral pontine lesion, also probably a chronic lacunar infarct, are both observed.
Following intravenous contrast administration, no abnormal enhancement is noted.
As was discussed today ([**2101-1-14**]) with the house staff, follow-up dedicated imaging of the orbits and cavernous sinuses, as well as MR angiography, could be helpful.
Epidermal soft tissue (E-F): Malignant neoplasm, most likely carcinoma.
Bone tissue tumor (G-H): Malignant neoplasm, most likely carcinoma.
No immunoreactivity is seen with LCA, synaptophysin, or TTF-1.
[**2101-1-14**] T7 MASS BIOPSY FLOW CYTOMETRY Non-diagnostic study.
[**2101-1-16**] LUE U/S Left cephalic vein thrombosis at antecubital fossa.
There are bilateral spinal rods and a right IJ line as well as skin staples.
There are mild degenerative changes and more pronounced facet arthrosis in the lumbar spine.
Prominent facet arthrosis is seen at the lumbosacral junction.
Irregular density adjacent to the left SI joint is noted.
If this does not represent a bone graft donor site, then further evaluation for bony lesion would be recommended.
There are moderate- to moderately-severe degenerative changes involving both hips.
Probable mild degenerative changes in the right and to a greater extent left knee.
With the exception of known areas in the thoracic spine, no focal lytic lesion is identified on this skeletal survey.
Degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine and hips noted.
Extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy with focal abnormal uptake of FDG with a 2.3 cm prevascular node with SUV of 15, and a 1 cm precarinal node with SUV 16.
Focal FDG uptake in bilateral hila.
Destructive bone lesion at T7 with SUV 12, and postoperative changes of the thoracic spine.
[**2101-1-27**] T-L AP AND LATERAL SPINE XRAY Posterior thoracic spinal fusion without hardware loosening.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 7046**] is a 65 year old woman with a history of PVD, HTN and CKD who presented with bilateral lower extremity weakness and numbness for six weeks.
T7 mass: The patient presented with lower extremity weakness and numbness.
MRI of her T-spine showed a mass at the T7 level with extension to the epidural space and cord edema concerning for malignancy.
A lumbar puncture was performed to evaluate for leptomeningeal involvement.
CSF studies showed atypical plasmacytoid cells but it was not felt that the cells were malignant in nature.
A biopsy was taken of the T7 mass for further diagnosis.
The biospy revealed poorly differentiated carcinoma of unknown primary.
Ortho-Spine performed a T3 to T11 fusion without complication.
A skeletal survey was performed and did not demonstrate any evidence of lytic bone disease.
Third cranial nerve dysfunction: The patient was noted to have right eye ptosis on admission.
Leptomeningeal disease was considered but not supported by the results of lumbar puncture.
The ptosis is most likely secondary to microvascular disease.
Left upper extremity cephalic vein clot: The patient was noted to have swelling and tenderness of the left upper extremity.
Ultrasound demonstrated superficial clot.
Hypercalcemia: The patient was hypercalcemic on admission and was found to have an elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH).
Microvascular disease on MRI: The patient likely had old disease.
Anemia: The patient experienced a significant drop in hematocrit post-operatively.
She had no signs of active ischemia during this admission.
HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension and was well controlled on this admission with amlodipine and a beta-blocker.
