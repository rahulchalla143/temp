Simple cyst towards the left epididymal head, which correlates to the area of palpable clinical swelling.
[**2195-9-25**] 8:12 AM Angiogram Evaluation demonstrates a vascular mass with mural nodule in the right cerebellar lobe.
[**2195-9-26**] 2:54 PM MR [**Name13 (STitle) **]: MRA, MRV, WAND STUDY and STEALTH PROTOCOL There is an enhancing, partially cystic mass identified in the right superior cerebellar hemisphere indenting on the pons and the fourth ventricle.
There is mild-to-moderate dilatation of the ventricles seen.
The cerebellar tonsils are low in position, extending approximately 5 mm below the level of foramen magnum secondary to mass effect.
The mass measures 2.7 x 3.3 x 3.1 cm in transverse, anterior posterior and superior inferior dimensions.
MRA: Demonstrates several small abnormal vascular structures within the mass in the right cerebellar hemisphere probably arising from the right posterior cerebral artery.
MRV: Prominent right lateral mesencephalic vein is visualized on the MRV of the head.
No evidence of venous sinus thrombosis.
Brief Hospital Course: 52M, c/o 6 months of paresthesias on the left leg MRI showed with cerebellar mass compressing 4th ventricle .
On physical exam he was found to have a left testicular mass an ultrasound showed a cyst.
On a [**9-26**] opthamology consulted to rule out retinal angioma which was ruled out.
On [**10-2**] he underwent Bilateral suboccipital craniotomy for resection of tumor using a stereotactic computer assisted volumetric intracranial procedure and a right sided frontal EVD placement.
The procedure was approximately 17 hours long and there were no intraoperative complications.
He was in the ICU for 5 days with a right frontal EVD on a steroid taper and Mannitol Q 6 hours and an exam of awaking briskly to voice following commands.
He was moving all 4 extremities and he had no obvious focal deficit.
Approximately 4 hours later Mr [**Known lastname **] had suddenly become somnolent and unresponsive.
The patient was taken stat to the CAT scanner which revealed significant swelling on the posterior fossa.
The patient was therefore taken emergently back to the operating room and had a bilateral suboccipital craniectomy, exploration, decompression of posterior fossa, resection of right sided cerebellar hemisphere (partial) duraplasty using pericranial autograft.
On rounds the morning of [**10-12**] he was found to extremely lethargic not following commands, a stat head CT revealed in the right cerebellum is a large area of hemorrhage extending around and compressing the brainstem.
Stable amount of edema and mass effect associated with this.
On [**10-16**] he had a PEG and trach placed without difficulty, due to lack of gag and waxing mental status.
On [**10-20**] he was brought to the OR and underwent a VP shunt without difficulty.
At midnight on [**10-20**] a head CT was done that showed good placement of VP shunt, slit ventricles but a reaccumulation of fluid in the epidural space and his exam he appeared more lethargic than the day prior.
Given the new collection of fluid and Mr [**Known lastname **] appearing more lethargic he was brought back to the OR ([**10-21**]) to evacuate the fluid place a cranioplasty with assistance of plastic surgery.
He grew Klebsiella out of his sputum and his antibiotic therapy was changed to Levaquin for 7 days to end on [**2195-10-29**].
On [**10-28**] a repeat CT showed a partial reaccumulation of fluid in the epidural space however neurologically he was improving steadily every day with following commands briskly responding appropriately to yes/no question and able to pivot out of bed with PT.
Physcial therapy found him to have a profound weakness on left side and neck weakness.
On [**11-1**] he had a repeat head and spine MRI.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: cerebellar mass with compression of fourth ventricle.
Discharge Instructions: 1) Call or return to ED if you notice increased redness, swelling or discharge from the wound.
Also call if you have increasing headaches, nausea, vomiting, or if mental status changes dramatically.
