There is no vascular congestion or pleural effusions.
There is no pneumothorax.
2) Moderate cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the aorta.
No pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
Lobulated mass extending from the pylorus, into the first portion of the duodenum; however, it is unclear whether this mass originates from the pylorus, or the duodenum.
No obstruction to oral contrast transit.
Numerous regional lymph nodes, none of which necessarily meet CT criteria for enlargement, but the number of these nodes is concerning for local metastatic disease.
No signs, however, of distant metastatic foci, although solid organs, such as the liver, are limited in evaluation.
Cardiomegaly, coronary artery disease, and aortic atherosclerosis.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality study.
At least moderate tricuspid regurgitation with moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Protruding Lesions A large fungating mass of malignant appearance with friability and stigmata of recent bleeding was found at the pylorus.
Impression: Blood in the fundus and stomach body Food in the stomach body and fundus Mass in the pylorus (biopsy) Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: Mass with stigmata of recent bleeding.
No blood or bleeding post-pylorus.
Suggest CT scan and surgical consult.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE Mr. [**Known lastname 5730**] is a pleasant [**Age over 90 **]yo male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on coumadin, hypertension, diastolic heart failure, who was transferred from OSH with a large volume GI bleed, attributed to a bleeding pyloric mass identified as adenocarcinoma.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # UPPER GI BLEED/PYLORIC ADENOCARCINOMA:  He initially presented to OSH with weakness and fatigue and was found to have a hematocrit of 15.5.
He had further hematemesis in their ICU and had a minimal hematocrit response to 5 units PRBC.
GI team performed upper endoscopy which revealed a large fungating pyloric mass with stigmata of recent bleeding, and retained food products in the stomach suggesting possible gastric outlet obstruction.
CT torso without contrast showed this pyloric mass with possibly enlarged lymph nodes nearby, but no widespread metastatic disease.
After discussing diagnosis with patient, family, and surgery team, will stay current course of supportive therapy.
If he bleeds again, he will require surgery or interventional radiology itnervention.
# HYPOTENSION: He was hypotension on admission secondary to acute blood loss but was aggressively resuscitated with fluids and blood products.
Upper extremity ultrasound revealed a non-occlusive thrombus in the right cephalic vein which did not extend to the axillary vein and no evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
Appearance likely to be thrombophlebitis superinfection.
He became progressively edematous by HD3 due to fluid/blood resuscitation.
Wound care was consulted to help manage lower extremity edema which was treated with aquafor ointment and kerlex wraps.
His peripheral edema was improving at the time of discharge.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
# HYPERTENSION:  Developed BP to 160s-180s on HD3, felt to be related to fluid overload.
# HYPOTHYROIDISM: Continue synthroid .
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES # Follow-Up: General Surgery, Hematology Oncology, Primary Care # Disposition: Home with nursing care was suggested for managment of significant medication changes and peripheral edema.
Disp:*1 tube* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Upper GI bleed Gastric Adenocarcinoma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for management of large volume gastrointestinal bleeding in our intensive care unit.
An upper endoscopy demonstrated a large mass in your stomach.
Biopsy revealed a gastric cancer.
Your coumadin was stopped in the setting of your bleed and your bleeding ultimately stopped.
You will have close follow-up with oncology and surgery for ongoing management.
