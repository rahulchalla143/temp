His wife who is his HCP states she has had similar episodes in the past but she is unable to say what those events were and how they were treated.
She gives him his medications at home and denied possibility of overdose although pt is on massive doses of narcotics at home and has been admitted for narcotics overdose in the past, most recently from [**Date range (1) 72225**].
He appeared unresponsive to noxious stimuli and had no gag, so was intubated for airway protection via rapid-sequence without medications.

Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: VS: T 103 HR 109 BP 109/65 RR 16 SaO2 97% on 550x16 FiO2 50% PEEP 5 GEN: intubated, sedated not following commands HEENT: PERRLA 4-->2 cm B/L CV: tachycardic rate, regular rhythm no murmurs appreciated LUNGS: no crackles/wheeze anteriorly, coarse ventilated breath sounds ABD: +BS soft NT ND, no HSM EXT: no edema B/L LE, w/w/p NEURO: intubated, sedation .
No egophony or tactile fremitus.
No fluid wave or shifting dullness.
Extremities: WWP, no edema.
No pronator drift.
No dysmetria or dysdiadhochinesia on exam.
No dysarthria.
Status post left lateral hepatic segmentectomy and cyberknife for the gastrohepatic lymphnode, with stable appearance of the resection margin.
Previosuly mentioned four lesions in the liver have slightly increased in size and are concerning for foci of HCC.
Gastrohepatic lymph node, slightly smaller since the prior study.
Interval appearance of new ground glass opacities in the lungs likely representing inflammatory process.
[**2158-3-24**] CT Head w/o con: No acute intracranial process.
No evidence of an acute fracture.
Stable appearance of multilevel degenerative joint changes, most pronounced at C5-C6 with posterior osteophyte disc complex formation mildly impinging upon the thecal sac without evidence of critical central canal stenosis.
In the setting of high clinical suspicion for ligamentous or central cord injury, may consider MR. 3.
Large amount of fluid pooling in the pharynx and hypopharynx, which may put the patient at risk for aspiration.
CXR [**3-25**]:  Extensive bilateral consolidation in the lower lungs, right greater than left, most likely pneumonia.
No significant ascites.
Multiple liver lesions are better appreciated on [**2158-3-23**] CT scan.
Brief Hospital Course: 56 M w/ HCV and EtOH cirrhosis w/ locally advanced unresectable HCC found down and unresponsive.
#Altered Mental Status: Etiology of unresponsiveness was unclear at time of admission.
Initial CT head was negative for acute process or for metastatic lesions.
On admission, ddx included meniningoencephalitis vs. hepatic encephalopathy vs anticholinergic delirium vs. narcotic overdose vs. sepsis, with ddx for possible LOC prior to admission including orthostatic syncope (especially given sepsis physiology and poor PO intake prior to admission).
Given fever to 103.8 on admission to MICU, sepsis was considered most seriously, and coverage was begun for SBP (h/o cirrhosis) and meningitis (fever and AMS) with vanco/ceftriaxone/ampicillin/acyclovir.
Lactulose was also started given concern for possible hepatic encephalopathy.
CXR ultimately showed development of PNA, and sputum culture was positive for S. pneumoniae and H. influenza; thus, all abx but CTX were discontinued on [**3-26**].
#Community Acquired PNA: While initial CXR on [**3-24**] not concerning for acute process, subsequent CXR on [**3-25**] showed development of extensive bilateral consolidation in the lower lungs (R>L), most likely pneumonia in the setting of fevers and hypotension.
He defervesced and remained afebrile and normotensive throughout his course.
Prior to transfer, patient was no longer requiring supplemental oxygen.
#Hypotension: Patient hypotensive with SBP in 70s on day of admission, likely secondary to sepsis in setting of PNA, as well as due to effects of sedating meds while intubated.
Patient did not have any evidence of ascites on exam, and RUQ ultrasound did not show significant ascites.
#Cachexia: Pt has Cre of 0.4 and BUN of 4, and relates hx of poor PO intake.
Neurology evaluation in [**11-30**] was c/w with L5/S1 sensory neuropathy as well as central issue (nystagmus, ataxia), possibly a Wernicke?????
MRI showed bilateral foraminal narrowing at L5/S1, with nerve impingement L>R.
He asserts that a neuropathy causing weakness and sensory problems led to him quitting his job on disability in [**2142**].
Prior eval showed elevated TSH (which normalized two weeks after admission), normal RPR, elevated B12.
#Bipolar disorder c/b SA x4 and legal issues s/p multiple hospitalizations: Denied active SI,HI, hallucinations and illusions.
