Benign hepatic parenchyma with focus of densely hyalinized fibrosis; no carcinoma seen.
Cholestasis and mild bile ductular proliferation with associated mixed inflammation, consistent with obstruction.
Trichrome stain demonstrates minimal expansion of portal fibrous tissue; iron stain shows mild iron deposition in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells.
Gallbladder, cholecystectomy (C-D): Focal acute and chronic cholecystitis; no carcinoma seen.
Lymph node, common hepatic artery, excisional biopsy (E): One lymph node with no carcinoma seen (0/1).
Invasive adenocarcinoma of the distal common bile duct; see synoptic report.
Three of thirteen lymph nodes positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma ([**3-10**]).
Duodenal segment with active duodenitis.
V.  Additional cystic duct, resection (AP-AS): Bile duct with focally prominent cautery effect, erosion, acute and chronic inflammation, and focal epithelial atypia, favor reactive; no invasive carcinoma seen.
Omentum, excision (AT-AX): Mature fibroadipose tissue with no carcinoma seen.
Distal Extrahepatic Bile Duct Resection Synopsis Includes Local / Segmental Resections and Pancreaticoduodenectomy Specimens  Staging according to American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual -- 7th Edition, [**2101**] MACROSCOPIC Specimen Type:  Other (Specify):  Whipple specimen.
MICROSCOPIC Histologic Type:  Adenocarcinoma (not otherwise specified).
Primary Tumor (pT):  pT3: Tumor invades the gallbladder, pancreas, duodenum or other adjacent organs without involvement of the celiac axis or superior mesenteric artery.
Pancreatic Retroperitoneal Margin: Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma.
Distal Pancreatic Margin: Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma.
Additional Pathologic Findings:  Dysplasia, active duodenitis, focal, mild active pancreatic inflammation  [**2105-7-4**] CT ABD: IMPRESSION: No contrast extravasation is seen to suggest active bleeding.
High-density fluid in the dependent pelvis consistent with hemoperitoneum which could be postoperative.
Additional regions of non-organized fluid in the abdomen, secondary to recent surgery.
Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Bilateral small pleural effusions, smaller on the right compared to the prior study with associated atelectasis/consolidation within the lung bases; otherwise the residual lung parenchyma is clear.
Increasing amount of ascites with no evidence of organized drainable collection.
No evidence of intestinal obstruction or perforation.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Decrease in fluid adjacent to caudate lobe of the liver.
No oral contrast extravasation at the pancreaticojejunostomy site.
Stable small bilateral pleural effusions and basilar atelectasis.
Possible underlying component of patchy bibasilar consolidation which could relate to aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting.
POD 1: There was bloody output from the patient's JP drain.
The patient was subsequently transported back to the OR, where an exploratory laparotomy revealed a retroperitoneal bleed which appeared to be venous.
During this time, the patient also required a phenylephrine drip secondary to hypotension.
The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
POD 2: Patient was taken back to the OR for surgical closure of his primary incision the following morning.
For pain control, patient had a dilaudid PCA, with good effect.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
At night, the patient became hypotensive and tachycardic with low output.
He was empirically started on vancomycin and zosyn for an elevated WBC of 27.3.
POD 11: Patient's abdominal incision line was explored with q-tips secondary to erythema developing around the suture line.
Approximately 500 cc of serosanguinous fluid was expressed from the wound, which was sent for gram stain and culture.
The patient's wound was packed with sterile gauze and his dressings were changed regularly.
CT scan with PO and IV contrast were performed, revealing a leak in his GI tract.
Wound culture came back positive for GNR's.
GNR's from the wound culture were speciated - Klebsiella pneumoniae, sensitive to cefepime and resistant to ciprofloxacin.
The patient was started on vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole, secondary to a rising WBC (19.7), ciprofloxacin was discontinued.
Reglan started for persistent nausea.
Plavix/ASA was discontinued s/t bleeding from incision.
Diarrhea x 5, Lactulose was discontinued.
POD 21 (7//24/12): Hypernatremia with Na 151.
POD 23 ([**2105-7-23**]): Given 2L D5W for hypernatremia 155.
He still has mild leukocytosis (14-15), afebrile.
Diarrhea subsided.
POD 29 ([**2105-7-29**]): Wound VAC was changed Q48H secondary to blood clot obstruction to suction.
Small emesis (~50 cc).
Lasix 20 mg IV was restarted in order to diurese patient with fluid overload.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating small sips, ambulating short distance with assist, still has a Foley for urine output monitoring, and pain was well controlled.
Metoclopramide 10 mg PO Q6H Please hold when patient having diarrhea 10.
Distal bile duct cholangiocarcinoma.
Acute and chronic cholecystitis.
Postoperative bleeding 4.
Enterocutaneous fistula 5.
Bacteremia 6.
Acute renal failure 7.
Hypernatremia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
VAC would be changed by nurses every 72 hours or prn.
PICC Line: *Please monitor the site regularly, and [**Name6 (MD) 138**] your MD, nurse practitioner, or [**Name6 (MD) 269**] Nurse if you notice redness, swelling, tenderness or pain, drainage or bleeding at the insertion site.
* [**Name6 (MD) **] your MD [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 10836**] to the Emergency Room immediately if the PICC Line tubing becomes damaged or punctured, or if the line is pulled out partially or completely.
Contact your [**Name2 (NI) 269**] Nurse if the dressing comes undone or is significantly soiled for further instructions.
