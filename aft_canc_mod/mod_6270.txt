He has not had any documented fevers but has felt chilled.
On arrival to [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) 1459**] he was reported as being alert and oriented, cyanotic, with diminished air movement bilaterally, using accessory muscles of respiration.
He was immediately intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
He became hypotensive and he received 2 liters normal saline and was started on a dopamine gtt.
He subsequently developed multifocal atrial tachycardia and was started on a diltiazem drip and his pressor was switched to neosynephrine.
On arrival he was intubated, sedated and unresponsive to questions.
He had an arterial line and a right sided IJ placed.

Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is at least borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
A trivial pericardial effusion is seen.
Moderately dilated right ventricle with mild hypokinesis.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Minimal aortic stenosis.
CXR [**3-28**]: Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged as well as there is no change in the right upper lobe mass highly suspicious for neoplasm.
Interval development of left lower lobe opacity is consistent with aspiration.
Bilateral pleural effusions are present, small.
Brief Hospital Course: Impression: 87 year old male with a history of COPD on 3L O2, lung cancer and congestive heart failure who is transferred from [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1459**] hospital for hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation and hypotension.
Shock:  Patient with subjective fevers at home, leukocytosis and hypotension concerning for septic shock.
Other potential etiologies for this patient include cardiogenic shock given his history of congestive heart failure and adrenal insufficiency given chronic steroids.
Less likely etiologies are hypovolemic, hemorrhagic, or obstructive shock.
In terms of etiologies for septic shock, pneumonia appears to be the most likely etiology although we will cover him broadly for now.
Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure:  Patient with tenuous lung function at baseline with known malignancy, home oxygen requirement and obstructive lung disease.
Given bilateral infiltrates and no clear evidence for congestive heart failure meets criteria for ARDS.
Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia:  Likely related to underlying lung disease.
Unclear what treatment he has had or degree of metastatic disease.
Congestive Heart Failure:  Ejection fraction 50% per echo on on [**3-27**].
Moderately dilated right ventricle with mild hypokinesis.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Minimal aortic stenosis.
Borderline pulmonary hypertension  Code:  DNR/DNI.
