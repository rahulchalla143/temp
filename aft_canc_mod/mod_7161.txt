Per reports, never had colonoscopy prior to NEBH colonscopy which showed  blood in colon although repeat colonoscopy on [**2145-5-13**] showed no blood.
Tagged red cell scan showed area of bleeding in sigmoid colon.
She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible embolization but upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] the patient was hemodynamically stable with hcts 28.5 and 27.5 over 12 hours so IR thought it would be unlikely they would find a bleed at this point as it appeared she was not bleeding profusely any longer.
GI was consulted but as no evidence of brisk bleeding did not feel needed to rescope.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], and her HCP, [**Name (NI) 1494**], all involved feel we have exhausted reasonable measures to stop the bleeding and we will focus on comfort care now.
