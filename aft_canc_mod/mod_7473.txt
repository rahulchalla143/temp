chemotherapy.
She is known to have extensive RCC and had recently underwent a right nephrectomy and IVC ligation due to complete thrombus.
On this admission she had resection of a duodenal mass seen on EGD that was thought to be high risk for bleeding complications if left alone and chemotherapy was initiated.
The duodenal mass was excised and repaired primarily with an omental patch.
She had epidural placed pre-operatively and was kept intubated on POD 0 and sent to the ICU because of length of operation.
Intra-operatively she required 6 units of blood and 7.5L of crystalloid and 750ml of colloid.
On POD 2 she had her epidural split and was placed on dilaudid PCA with good pain control and was brought to the floor.
On POD 9, in setting of sepsis, she developed confusion that resolved over 24 hours after antibiotic therapy was initiated.
The patient's pain remains well controlled with PO pain medications prior discharge with minimal requirements.
CV: During her initial stay in the unit and on the floor she was hemodynamically stable until POD 9 when she developed tachycardia and fever thought to be due to sepsis.
She was occasionally tachyarcardic at time of discharge but was asymptomatic and was refusing continued lopressor.
She was transferred to the floor on POD 2 and had no oxygen requirements throughout her hospitalization despite having bacteremia.
On POD 6 UGI study showed no leak and good flow on contrast through gastro-jejunostomy.
On returning to the floor, POD 10, her NGT was discontinued but she was noted to have bilious output from her JP drain and so an NGT was replaced.
She had been advanced to tube feeds goal of 60cc/hr and was started octreotide 150 TID in addition to reglan, but was noted to have increased NGT output and have tube feed coloring to NGT output and so tube feeds were reduced down to 30cc/hr.
She was again clamp trailed on POD 19 and had increasing abdominal pain, increased JP output, and nausea and was put back on wall suction.
JP 2 continued to have bilious output which because more sanguineous on POD 29 but resolved and became scant on POD 31.
GU: Patient initially had low urine output during the case that picked back up post operatively.
During her stay in the ICU her hourly urine output was adequate except for a transient drop that resolved after she was given 2 units of blood.
On POD 9 she received 2 additional units of RBCs and required no further transfusions.
On POD 9 she was also scanned and found to have new SMV and protal vein thrombosis and so was started on a heparin drip.
She became therapeutic within 24 hours but then strangely became subtherapeutic on POD 12, despite increases in the heparin drip rate.
She had multiple factor xa levels checked, the second being 0.56, and was followed by the hematology team who agreed with dosing of 70mg [**Hospital1 **] Lovenox, thought that she would need lifelong anticoagulation, and argued that Lovenox is better than coumadin for cancer patients based on recent data.
The patient required multiple blood transfusion for low HCT.
Low HCT thought to be secondary to slow duodenal bleed and subcutaneous hematoma.
The EGD on [**2115-2-21**] was negative for acute bleed, and hematoma was removed with wound VAC.
She was afebrile until spiking to 104 on POD 9.
CT scan that day showed fat stranding around the duodenum but no free air or clear fluid collection.
She was started on vanc and zosyn after GNR found on blood cultures, which eventually grew out pan sensitive E. Coli, at which point vancomycin was stopped.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating with walker, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
Metastatic renal cell carcinoma 2.
Duodenal stump leak 3.
Sepsis with E. Coli 4.
Right upper quadrant subcutaneous hematoma at the wound site 6.
[**Last Name (un) **] mass with stigmata of recent bleeding at the second part of the duodenum   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Your stay was complicated by sepsis, portal vein and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis, right upper quadrant hematoma at the wound site, tachycardia, and continued GI bleed requiring transufsions which have all been managed.
You are now stable for discharge home with continued close follow up and care with a visiting nurse who will continue to monitor your blood levels (Hematocrit) as well as assist with dressing changes for your incisional wound.
**Please contact us immediately if you note any new or worsening bleeding.
**  Please call your doctor or go to the emergency department if: *You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or tightness.
You often had a rapid heart rate (tachycardia) during your admission which we initially treated with a medication called metoprolol (lopressor) which you recently wished to stop taking.
Please alert the surgical team, your PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] present to the ED if you start to experience chest pain or other concerning symptoms (dizziness, lightheadness, shortness of breath, pain raidiating down your left arm, palpitations (feeling that your heart is beating too fast), or sweating in the context of the above symptoms).
*You develop new or worsening cough, shortness of breath, or wheeze.
*You are vomiting and cannot keep down fluids or your medications.
*You are getting dehydrated due to continued vomiting, diarrhea, or other reasons.
Signs of dehydration include dry mouth, rapid heartbeat, or feeling dizzy or faint when standing.
You had this finding in the hospital - please notify if this gets worse (bright red blood in stools, increased amount of dark black stools) or if persists for more than 2 days.
*Your pain is not improving within 12 hours or is not under control within 24 hours.
*Your pain worsens or changes location.
*You have shaking chills, or fever greater than 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius.
You may shower but keep the open area of your incision covered, and wash surgical incisions with a mild soap and warm water.
