The patient was in her usual state of health until five days prior to admission when she noted the onset of a wet cough and runny nose.
Her symptoms progressed and she developed signficant fatigue and slept most of the day.
Of note, her son and her husband also had colds over the last several days, but their symptoms started after the patient initially started having symptoms.
A child developed flu-like symptoms and it was recommended to this child's mother to have the patient checked for H1N1.
She denies muscle aches, joint pains or rash.
She had a single episode of loose stool with fecal urgency this morning and also vomited once while in the ED.
She believes she had another single episode of loose stool during this illness.
CXR demonstrated bilatral consolidations consistent with pneumonitis.
During her prolonged ED course, she developed a fever to 102.9 and was given 1 gram of Tylenol.
At arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]: she reports feeling tired, thirsty but overall improved.
Past Medical History: She first developed left posterior rib pain in [**2111**] and was found to have multiple destructive rib lesions.
Work-up at the time revealed a modest IgG kappa and a question of light chain in the urine.
Bone marrow showed a modest increase in plasma cells without clear evidence of clonality.
She had a bone bone marrow biopsy, which showed 10% plasma cells with abundance of kappa staining and evidence of plasma cell aggregates and plasmablast.
The patient underwent a repeat skeletal survey, which showed new punched out lesions in  the skull as well as a calcium of ~10.4-10.9.
At [**Hospital1 18**], bone marrow biopsy showed plasma cells accounting for approximately 20% of the cells with kappa restriction.
In [**2114-3-21**] the patient had acute diplopia and was found to have a CNS plasmacytoma and underwent radiation therapy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Irregular menstrual cycles (one per year), found to have an ovarian cyst.
No oral lesions.

Microbiology: Rapid Respiratory Viral Antigen Test (Final [**2114-5-22**]): Respiratory viral antigens not detected.
Imaging: CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2114-5-21**]: Bibasal opacification consistent with pneumonitis either infectious or from aspiration.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2114-5-22**]: Asymmetric edema versus multifocal pneumonia.
Interval progression of widespread predominantly peripheral opacities that represent areas of pure ground glass or combination of central solid components surrounded by ground glass.
The distribution, the radiological appearance and the time course are highly suspicious for infection, in particular fungal infection given the combination of solid and ground glass components.
The viral or bacterial infection is still possibility.
Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, drug toxicity or bone marrow transplantation-related reactions are possibility which is less likely.
Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis.
Brief Hospital Course: 54F w multiple myeloma c/b CNS involvement presenting with flu-like symptoms for 5 days duration including high fever, cough, rhinorrhea and bibasilar consolidations consistent with pneumonitis and/or multifocal pneumonia.
Due to her hypoxia and hypotension, the patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient Based on clinical symptoms and CXR were consitent with a multifocal PNA.
Of note, patient also had exposure through gardening on [**Hospital1 107**] Day to fungal pathogens and exposure to contacts with flu.
Patient continued on Cefepime and Vancomycin for concern of HAP (patient recently been in the hospital and has been to the medical center frequently for chemotherapy, appointments and radiation which will put her at risk for resistant gram negative organisms and MRSA).
Hypotension - Patient had brief episode of hypotension to SBP 88, otherwise ranged from 90-100.
Adrenal insufficiency may also be playing a part in this patient who has received multiple doses of steroids during chemotherapy.
She had no further episodes of hypotension.
Elevated transaminases/elev.
