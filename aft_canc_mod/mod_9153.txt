The patient returned for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on [**2186-11-28**], which revealed successful chemoablation of the biliary duct and irregular stricture of malignant appearance of 20 millimeters in length was noted in the lower post-obstructive dilatations compatible with malignance of biliary obstruction.
Based on all of the data accumulated including CA [**02**]-9 of 27,000, it was felt by the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography team that he most likely has metastatic pancreatic carcinoma and would not be amenable to further treatment.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient's creatinine continued to climb into the fives with hypercalcemia and metabolic acidosis that continued.
He had negative ANCA antibodies which was a mixed picture consistent with either post-Streptococcal glomerular nephritis or an auto-immune glomerular nephritis and it was felt that the biopsies will be determining factor.
His pathology initially showed diabetic nephropathy without active inflammation, but the IF and EM are pending at the time of discharge.
ANEMIA:  The patient's iron studies revealed iron deficiency anemia.
Speech and Swallow evaluated the patient and the patient did not have any signs of aspiration on the bedside.
The patient remained to have mild changes consistent with delirium in his mental status which was felt likely to go on for it to completely resolve.
PULMONARY:  The patient experienced respiratory distress and desaturation to 70% following his endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
No gastrointestinal follow-up was arranged as there was a question of utility to this.
Jaundice, likely secondary to pancreatic malignancy, awaiting final biopsy.
Acute renal failure from acute glomerular nephritis; awaiting biopsy for a final interpretation.
Iron deficiency anemia.
Diabetes mellitus.
