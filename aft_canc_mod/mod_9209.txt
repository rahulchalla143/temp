STAGE IV NONSMALL CELL LUNG CANCER:  Complicated by prior SVC syndrome and recent pericardial tamponade.
Likewise, a repeat echocardiogram on [**2103-5-1**] revealed no evidence of reaccumulation of the patient's pericardial effusion.
Of note, the patient had persistent sinus tachycardia with rates ranging between 100 and 130 in the days prior to discharge.
On [**2103-5-4**], the patient was given intravenous fluids with resultant improvement of her sinus tachycardia.
FOLLOW-UP FOR TREATMENT OF HER HYPOXEMIA:  At the time of transfer from the Intensive Care Unit, the patient had an oxygen requirement of [**3-24**] liters on nasal cannula.
The differential diagnosis for the hypoxemia was felt to include left heart failure and V/Q mismatch secondary to postobstructive pneumonia.
The patient completed a ten day course of levofloxacin for postobstructive pneumonia.
A chest radiograph on [**2103-4-27**] was consistent with heart failure.
The patient had persistent hypertension which was managed with metoprolol, lisinopril, and Amlodipine.
The patient diuresed successfully without the aid of a supplemental diuretic and her oxygen requirement decreased to a point where she was on room air and ambulating well by [**2103-5-3**].
A repeat chest radiograph done on [**2103-5-4**] revealed interval improvement with no evidence of heart failure and reduction in the size of her pleural effusion.
PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION AND LEFT ATRIAL THROMBUS: At the time of transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was on a heparin drip for management of her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and left atrial thrombus.
It was decided that anticoagulation would pose a risk of intracerebral hemorrhage as well as hemopericardium that would outweigh the risk of stroke for the patient's projected life span.
While the issue was being considered, the patient developed a falling platelet count, from 165,000 on [**2103-4-29**] to a nadir of 54 on [**2103-5-4**].
This study revealed resolution of previously seen vasogenic edema within the right occipital lobe, and decrease in size of a previously enhancing right occipital lesion.
There was a minimal decrease in size of the left cerebellar lesion as well as partial response to treatment in the leptomeningeal frontal lesions.
Status post PEA arrest.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Coronary artery disease.
Oral herpes simplex virus.
