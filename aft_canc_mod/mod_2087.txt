History of Present Illness: This is a 70 year old woman with past medical history significant for COPD (0.55 FEV1/FVC 38% of predicted on home O2), status post left upper lobe endobronchial lung reduction, CAD, CHF, PVD status post multiple bypass surgeries, on chronic anticoagulation who presented with worsened dyspnea over the past 4 weeks associated with hoarseness of voice since 2 weeks.
She was also found to have a CXR which showed left lung collapse with tracheal deviation to the left, and was referred to our ED for this, where she received a combivent nebulizer prior to transfer.
On presentation to the ED, the patient was complaining of dyspnea and was tachypneic with respiratory rate to 25 with O2 sat 95% on 5L.
She denies any recent chest pain, fever or chills, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, headache, dysuria and polyuria.
Since presenting to the MICU, she has undergone emergent rigid bronchoscopy which demonstrated a mass in the left bronchus which has subsequently been shown to be non small cell carcinoma, likely squamous cell.
She is on aspiration precautions for a paralyzed vocal cord and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 33748**] as an outpatient.
Two nights prior to moving out of the MICU, the patient was found to be in asymptomatic atrial fibrillation with RVR.
She was switched from IV to PO amiodarone on [**8-21**] and has been in sinus rhythm since the night prior to transfer.
She denies any shortness of breath that is worse than her usual.
She denies any pain and states that she is "ready to get out" of the hospital.
She denies palpitations and chest pain.
Past Medical History: 1) COPD, FEV1 0.55, FEV1/FVC 38% of predicted 2) Status post LUL endobronchial lung reduction surgery [**12/2159**] 3) CAD status post remote MI (no history of cath) 4) CHF, previous EF 35% but most recent echo in [**2160**] with EF 55%  5) Mobile mass in mitral valve, unknown etiology 6) Peripheral vascular disease s/p multiple bypass surgeries 7) Prior history of DVT's 8) History of small bowel obstruction s/p exp.
Eyes: PERRL, EOMi, sclerae anicteric Mouth: MM somewhat dry, no bruising/bleeding Neck: No bruits, supple, no LND Chest: Decreased breath sounds in both fields, no wheezes appreciated Heart: Tachycardic regular distant heart sounds.
Left lung atelectasis with associated leftward mediastinal shift.
Severe emphysema.
Ground glass peribronchial opacities in the right lung, likely infectious, warranting CT. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, presumably reactive .
Extensive intrathoracic malignancy, left lower lobe primary mass with hilar adenopathy obstructing left upper lobe bronchus and mediastinal extension crossing the midline in both the subcarinal and lower paratracheal stations.
Severe emphysema.
Left upper lobe fully collapsed.
Embolic occlusion proximal left subclavian artery, not due to tumor invasion.
Rare atypical squamous cells.
Squamous cells, inflammatory cells and bacteria .
"Left main stem tumor biopsy for frozen": Non-small cell carcinoma, favor squamous cell, focus suspecious for lymphatic vascular invasion.
Left upper lobe remains collapsed and left hilus enlarged.
New bronchial stent extends from the carina to just before the anticipated location of the left upper lobe takeoff.
Severe emphysema in the right lung, otherwise clear.
Labs at discharge:   Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 47011**] is a 69 year old female with a history of COPD on home oxygen (4L NC), status post left upper lobe reduction, CAD, CHF, peripheral vascular disease on chronic anticoagulation who presented with dyspnea secondary to left lung collapse and associated tracheal deviation.
On bronchoscopy, the patient had a mass seen with biopsies taken which were consistent with squamous cell lung cancer; a subsequent CT chest confirms extensive intrathroacic malignancy.
#) Left lung collapse/atelectasis: On bronchoscopy, a mass was seen with biopsies taken which were consistent with squamous cell lung cancer.
#) Coagulalopathy: The patient did have a supratherapeutic INR on admission on coumadin.
At that time, her coumadin was held, and her INR improved with vitamin K. Heparin was started for bridge to coumadin prior to discharge, and transitioned to lovenox 50mg [**Hospital1 **] until her INR becomes therapeutic.
On day of discharge, INR was 1.6 today, we therefore increased coumadin to 2mg po daily today, and discharged home on lovenox 50mg SC BID (to treat embolic occlusion of left subclavian artery), while waiting for INR to become therapeutic.
She has no signs or symptoms of active bleeding.
#) Atrial fibrillation: Following her first episode of atrial fibrillation, the patient was loaded with amiodarone IV with conversion to normal sinus rhythm.
She reverted back to atrial fibrillation subsequently and was restarted on an amiodarone drip.
Therefore, her underlying lung disease could be contributing to her dyspnea.
She was begun on prednisone for presumed COPD exacerbation, and will be discharged home with a 3 day taper (2 more days on 20mg then 3days on 10mg po qdaily).
#) Peripheral vascular disease - Pt was dicharged on aspirin and pentoxyfilline.
# FEN: Regular diet with thin liquids and regular solids per Speech & Swallow.
# Code status: Patient states that she does not want to have any shocks or chest compressions.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for anxiety.
Cepacol 2 mg Lozenge Sig: One (1) Lozenge Mucous membrane PRN (as needed) as needed for throat pain.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 932**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Lung cancer, squamous cell COPD CAD Peripheral vascular disease   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable and on 4L NC (home regimen)   Discharge Instructions: Please take all medications as prescribed.
Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room should you experience any of the following symptoms: chest pain, increasing shortness of breath, fever or chills, easy bruising, blood in your urine or stools, bleeding gums, increasing hoarseness of voice, or any other concerns.
