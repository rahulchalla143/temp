On [**2138-8-3**], patient had been started on Vancomycin and Piperacillin-Tazobactam for presumed hospital acquired pneumonia based on increased O2 requirement, infiltrates on chest x-ray, and low-grade fevers.
Of note, patient has failed gastric and duodenal stenting and continues to have persistent gastric outlet obstruction with pooling of secretions, and was felt to have intermittent aspiration of these secretions.
An NG tube was placed for persistent obstruction.
Patient is on furosemide at home for unclear reasons, but this had been held 4 days prior to transfer due to fluid-responsive hypotension in setting of gastric outlet obstruction.
His fluid intake over the past 24 hours consisted of D5W for hyponatremia and TPN.
Past Medical History: -- Recent diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma -- Diabetes diagnosed 25 years ago currently on Insulin.
-- Chronic kidney failure secondary to diabetes.
-- Peripheral vascular disease.
-- Stroke TIA in [**2135**].

[**8-6**] UA: hazy, 4+ WBCs, 5 RBCS, few bacteria [**8-6**] sediment: 12 granular casts, 5 hyaline casts  CXR [**8-5**]: Greater opacification at the right base is probably atelectasis, though pneumonia cannot be excluded.
A small right pleural effusion and congestion of pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature indicating improving cardiac function.
Small left pleural effusion persists.
No pneumothorax.
Has gastric outlet obstruction related to tumor.
Failed duodenal stenting X 2.
He ultimately required NG placement and constant suction because of nausea and vomiting.
Hypotension/hypoxia: He developed a GI bleed related to the stent leading to hypotension which responded to IV fluid and blood transfusion.
He later had acute desaturation from aspiration requiring MICU transfer.
He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for health care associated pneumonia  3.
Hypernatremia related to dehydration, improved with IV D5W.
Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: related to dehydration and hypotensive episode.
