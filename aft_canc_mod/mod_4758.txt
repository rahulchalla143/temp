Brief Hospital Course: This is a 64 year old man with relapsed [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH after being admitted for febrile neutropenia, found to have MRSA bacteremia, pneumonia, course complicated by Afib with RVR, acute renal failure, short course in the MICU.
He was started on hydroxyurea as well as stress dose steroids, which should be continued at the discretion of his outpatient oncologist.
# Bacteremia/Pneumonia: MRSA bacteremia, still febrile on broad spectrum antibiotics, vancomycin, imipenem and azithromycin.
He was started on standing tylenol 1g q6h to prevent fever and subsequent afib with rvr.
Ativan prn for shortness of breath.
# Acute Renal Failure: Likely [**2-23**] Afib/flutter with RVR causing CHF with poor forward flow.
# A.fib/flutter: Initally, patient was on a diltiazem drip on admission, which had controlled his rate during his past hospitalization.
# CAD: Concern for tachycardia induced ischemia, titrate heart rate to < 90.
- Still pending.
# FEN: neutropenic cardiac diet.
Morphine Sulfate 1-2 mg IV Q4-6H:PRN Hold for sedation or RR < 12.
Fever/Neutropenia 2.
MRSA bacteremia 3.
Acute Renal Failure 4.
Atrial fibrillation/flutter with rapid ventricular rate   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for breathing fast and increasing blast count.
We have increased the dose of your beta blocker, put you on an amio load and a diltiazem drip and started a new antibiotic.
