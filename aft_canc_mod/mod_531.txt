Had been on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis and recently hospitalized at OMED from [**2199-11-20**] to [**2199-11-22**] after a first episode generalized seizure and subsequently started on Dexamethasone, which has been weaning off since the end of [**Month (only) **], given side-effects including mood swings, insomnia, weight gain and bloating and most recent gadolinium-enhanced head MRI, as compared to his prior head MRI from [**2199-11-12**], revealed shrinkage of his mesial left frontal metastasis from 14 cm to 9 cm; there was also less cerebral edema in the adjacent brain.
Today he has a 15-min seizure witnessed by family that started with L arm and L leg jerking and progressed to GTC sz.
He was loaded with Dilantin and given Decadron 10 mg iv; he had a NCHCT that showed a 7 mm L parietal bleed and so was transferred here, where at 22h18 he received Propofol 20 mcgs followed by infusion of 10mcg/kg/min, as well as 10 mg Vec for repeat head CT at 23h05.
?s neurological problem began on [**2198-4-28**] when he developed a headache and difficulty using his left arm, as well as progressing left leg weakness that caused an unsteady gait.
His headache, weakness and poor coordination increased over the next few days, and co-workers encouraged him to seek medical care.
On [**2198-5-4**] he presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Department where an MRI revealed a 1.8 X 1.4 cm mass in the right frontal parietal area that suggested a solid tumor.
Pathology revealed metastatic clear cell carcinoma consistent with renal cell carcinoma.
The patient subsequently had an abdominal CT on [**2198-5-7**] which indicated a mass on the left kidney with a central area of necrosis.
There was also evidence of multiple pulmonary nodules bilaterally and two discrete lesions noted in the liver that were too small to fully characterize on the CT scan.
He had post-operative complications of confusion related to pain medication and a bowel obstruction -- both resolved.
Past Medical History: Presented [**4-/2198**] with headache and clumsiness, found to have brain mass, subsequently found to have renal cancer with pulmonary mets.
[**2198-5-4**]: Resection of a solitary brain metastasis from the right parietal brain suggestive of clear cell carcinoma by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name **].
[**8-/2198**] underwent radical left nephrectomy, cholecystectomy, and omentectomy for renal cell carcinoma (renal vein invasion; subsequently found to have pulmonary mets).
[**8-20**] found to have new Rt-sided weakness and found to have new brain masses; [**2199-9-3**] stereotactic bx ws non-diagnositic; [**2199-9-27**] underwent cyberknife to L parasagital metastasis (2200 cGy).

There are areas of vasogenic edema, in the left frontal as well as right parietal lobe, significantly decreased in extent, compared to the prior study of [**2199-11-20**].
There are craniotomy changes in the right parietal bone.
Tiny focus of hyperdensity left frontal lobe near vertex due  to chronic blood products in previously noted metastasis on MRI of [**2199-12-9**].
Interval decrease in extent of left frontal and right parietal vasogenic edema.
CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with metastatic disease with question of new lesion in the left frontal convexity region on the recent CT, for further evaluation.
TECHNIQUE:  T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images were obtained before gadolinium.
T1 axial, sagittal and coronal images were obtained following the administration of gadolinium.
FINDINGS:  A small enhancing metastatic lesion is identified at the right posterior frontal convexity region at the site of abnormality seen on CT.
There are no areas new areas of enhancement identified.
There is no mass effect seen, midline shift identified or hydrocephalus noted.
IMPRESSION:  Since the previous MRI of [**2199-12-9**], the left frontal convexity lesion has decreased in size with decrease in enhancement and surrounding edema.
The right parietal lesion has also decreased in size with decrease in edema.
No definite new lesions are seen.
No acute infarcts are identified.
EEG [**2199-12-28**]: Reportedly showed frequent right frontocentral sharps, right slowing without repitition or seizure activity; official read pending.
Brief Hospital Course: 48 yo man with metastatic renal cell Ca, on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis, who has been weaning off dexamethasone for his cerebral metastasis and presented with a L focal seizure that secondarily generalized.
He was found to have right parietal bleed on a head CT from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital, where he was intubated.
Also has a left posterior frontal lesion.
We will discharge the patient with standing seroquel 50mg at HS and an Rx for PRN seroquel as well.
He was stable on keppra and dilantin with no further sezures.
EEG reportedly showed frequent right frontocentral sharps, right slowing without repitition or seizure activity.
Unexplained tachycardia since 11 pm [**12-29**].
It was possible that the patient remained anxious and tachycardic (does not appear significantly dry or in pain), but we wanted to rule out other medical issues.
The possibility for PE in a patient with malignancy is a real possibility and we checked a d-dimer (it turned out > 500).
CT with contrast was negative for PE but demonstrated increased diameter of the patient's lung masses.
Low Grade fevers:  The patient had a mildly positive UA on initial check but we felt that it more than likely represented bacturia without pyuria.
As such we stopped the antibiotics (bactrim) that were started briefly and checked another UA that revealed no infection.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for headache.
Patient has no obvious neurological sequela of his brain mets.
He came in on keppra and low dose dex and will be discharged on keppra, dilantin and 4mg/day dex.
Please return to the hospital if you should have any symptoms that are concerning to you.
