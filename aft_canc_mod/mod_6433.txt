with metastatic melanoma who gets all of his care at [**Hospital3 328**] and [**Hospital1 112**] who presents with hemoptysis.
He developed hemoptysis 1 week ago, intially only in the a.m., <1 tsp, but increased in frequency over the week.
Also with increasing DOE when climbing stairs (normally able to do this without difficulty) over the last week and developed right flank pain with coughing.
No orthopnea or PND, although has been sleeping upright in a chair for the last 6 months due to sinus congestion.
Went to his oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 62563**] on Wednesday and a CXR was done which showed a pneumonia per the patient, and he was given 10 days of an antibiotic, although he does not know which one.
Denies fevers, chills, nausea, emesis or hematemesis.
Has LE edema, L>R due to recently diagnosed DVT - treated with lovenox but not on coumadin.
Presented to [**Hospital3 1443**] for hemoptysis, no beds at [**Hospital3 328**], and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation.
CTA done and was negative for PE but showed many large bilateral pulmonary nodules and masses c/w widespread metastatic disease with a dominant right hilar mass encasing and narrowing the right inferior pulmonary vein and likely occluding the right lower lobe segmental bronchus with resultant extensive airspace opacity throughout the right lower lobe, most consistent with postobstructive pneumonia.
He is admitted to the ICU for observation and possible bronchoscopy.
Past Medical History: # Melanoma - diagnosed in [**2169**] in left upper arm.
Resected with LN dissection and free of disease until [**2172**] when found to have bony disease in left shoulder and lump on L flank.
Underwent XRT for shoulder and resection of left flank lesion that was found to be melanoma.
At some point had PET showing 1cm lung nodules bilaterally, and two small lesions in his intestine.

with metastatic melanoma on chemotherapy who presents with hemoptysis.
# Hemoptysis - CTA concerning for widespread metastatic disease and encasement of pulmonary vein leading to hemoptysis and obstruction of RLL bronchus leading to postobstructive PNA.
The differential for his hemoptysis is most likely pulmonary related to bleeding from his mets, especially in light of recent chemo trial where increased frequency of bleeding has been seen and with bronch showing clot in the airway.
Also on ddx is nasal polyp.
Pt reports having epistaxis and difficulty breathing in the past for which he was evaluated by ENT at [**Hospital1 112**], last time 6 months ago, found to have large nasal polyp.
Patient underwent bronchoscopy that revealed no evidence of active bleed and old blood in RLL.
# PNA - Appears to have post obstructive PNA based on CT scan.
Slight fever with mild leukocytosis.
# H/O DVT - Occurred approximately one month ago and received lovenox, but no longer anticoagulated for unclear reasons.
# Anemia ??????
# HTN - Continue outpatient meds.
