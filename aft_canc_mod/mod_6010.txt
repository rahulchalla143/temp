This is a 75 yo F with metastatic (brain/bone) transitional cell CA of bladder, here from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with tachypnea (RR 40-42), hypoxia (70s%), tachycardia (119-128), hypotension (62/40), temp 98.
CXR at rehab felt to be consistent with bilateral PNA.
EKG showed sinus tach at 130 bpm, T wave flattening diffusely.
Chronic leg ulcers, improving.
H/o C. diff infection.
Transitional cell CA with mets to brain and bone.
A fib with RVR, bursts of SVT: in setting of post-op pain from hip fracture  Social History: Formerly worked in an administrative role at [**Hospital1 18**] in Pathology.
Physical Exam: Exam on Admission: General: Intubated and sedated, NAD HEENT: ETT in place Lungs: Coarse breath sounds anteriorly with slightly crackles on left CV: Tachycardic, regular rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: +BS.
soft, non-tender, mildly distended.
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, 1+ pitting edema at upper thighs, R thigh without tense compartments or apparent ecchymosis, ankles wrapped in gauze  Pertinent Results: I. Labs  A.
At least two patchy foci, one in the right infrahilar region and one in the retrocardiac left lower lobe, which may represent foci of aspiration or early-developing multifocal pneumonia.
Subtle pulmonary vascular indistinctness may indicate early pulmonary edema 4.
Compression fracture of a lower thoracic vertebral body of indeterminate acuity.
Small pleural effusions.
Multifocal opacities within both lungs are new and while they may represent multifocal pneumonia in light of the other findings, metastatic disease is also a consideration.
New bilateral small pleural effusions.
New liver metastases involving both lobes.
New retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
Worsening bone metastases.
Retroperitoneal soft tissue mass decreased in size.
No evidence of acute intracranial findings.
Grossly unchanged right cavernous sinus mass, extending along the tentorium.
MRI would be more sensitive for posterior fossa abnormalities and reassessment of metastatic disease, particularly if brainstem and cranial nerve involvement is suspected.
Complete right mastoid opacification and middle ear opacification.
Given concern for perineural tumor spread from the right cavernous sinus, this finding may relate to obstruction of drainage by the skull base mass.
Please correlate clinically to assess for acute infection.
Partial left mastoid air cell opacification.
Brief Hospital Course: Hospital course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 19704**] is a 75-year-old female with metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder who presented with hypoxic respiratory failure that was likely multifactorial in setting of tumor burden and possible multifocal pneumonia although aspiration is a consideration, and hemodynamic instability requiring aggressive volume resuscitation, pressor support with norepinephrine, and intubation.
The patient had last been treated for cancer, but her regimen has been on hold since [**Month (only) **] secondary to a hip fracture with subsequent poor performance status and medical issues related to her rehabiliation and chronic medical conditions.
Imaging revealed further metastasis with suggested brain involvement, new retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, worsening bone metastases, new liver metastases, and possible multifocal lung metastatis although pneumonia was a consideration.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: Her respiratory failure was thought to be secondary to either multifocal pneumonia or worsening metastasis from underlying malignancy.
PE was excluded in setting of recent hip fracture s/p repair.
She was treated broadly with vancomycin (IV and PO), cefepime, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole for both anaerobic and pulmonary infections in addition to C. diff given leukocytosis.
# Septic shock: Patient was hypotensive on presentation and required high-volume resuscitation, pressor support with levophed.
Etiology was thought to be septic process although high tumor burden could have caused destabilization and no overt evidence in favor of septic process.
She was empirically covered with aforementioned antimicrobials for infection although her blood, sputum, and urine cultures were not suggestive of infection.
Patient subsequently switched to phenylephrine as having episodes of hypotension associated with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Given evidence of worsening perfusion with oliguria and upward trend of lactate, she was subsequently placed back on levophed with minimal effect and continuing deterioration until her death.
It was unclear if her deterioration was due mostly to a septic picture or worsening malignancy.
# Metastatic transitional cell cancer: Patient was noted to have worsening metastasis on imaging as above.
She had received treatment in the past, which was limited of recent by a fall with resultant hip fracture and subsequent poor performance.
Oncology was involved during her hospitalization indicating that further therapy would likely only worsen her condition in the setting of an already poor prognosis.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient likely developed atrial fibrillation in setting of acute illness and secondary to cardiostimulatory pressor.
On her last day of hospitalization, her episodes were causing severe hemodynamic instability.
Likely secondary to overwhelming systemic illness with marrow suppression with no evidence of acute blood loss.
Hemolysis and DIC labs did not suggest such processes.
# Acute oliguric renal failure Her renal function declined likely secondary to pre-renal processes from poor perfusion leading to acute tubular necrosis.
Tumor lysis syndrome in setting of burden was thought to be less likely.
# Transaminitis Patient noted to have elevated liver function tests thought to be secondary to liver metastasis and worsened by underling systemic process.
# Metabolic acidosis Patient developed marked acidosis likely to underlying inflammatory process.
# Thrombocytopenia with coagulopathy Patient noted to develop thrombocytopenia likely multifactorial etiology with marrow suppression, drug side effect from antibiotics (no known heparin usage).
For coagulopathy, there was a concern for DIC as above.
