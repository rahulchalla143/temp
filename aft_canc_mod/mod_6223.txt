Over 2 weeks, patient had increased pruritus.
U/S of liver showed ductal dilatation with bilirubin elevation.
ERCP findings concerning for cholangiocarcinoma with hilar stricture c/w cholangiocarcinoma on right side  Past Medical History: CAD s/p pacemaker, s/p cath [**2133**]: 70% stenosis, HTN, DM, h/o DVT/PE, pancreatitis PSH: s/p TKA [**2135**], SBR ?
diverticulitis  Social History: widowed with children denied etoh/smoking/illicit drugs independent at senior living  Brief Hospital Course: On [**2138-2-7**], a cholangiogram was performed to evaluate the bile duct anatomy.
This demonstrated severely dilated left-sided hepatic ducts with high- grade stricture approximately 2 cm in lenght extending from the confluence of the common hepatic and left hepatic ducts to just central to the confluence of the segment II and segment III left hepatic ducts.
Mildly dilated right anterior ducts were noted with a stricture in the central right anterior ducts as well as a markedly dilated gallbladder were also noted.
The right posterior ducts were not visualized likely due to high grade stricture or obstruction of central right posterior ducts.
Unasyn had been started prior to the Cholangiogram and this was continued for 5 days until bile cultures revealed that Klebsiella sensitivity to Unasyn was indeterminate.
On [**2-9**], a triple phase CT was done showing a large Klatskin-type hilar mass with imaging characteristics compatible with a cholangiocarcinoma.
There was intrahepatic bile duct dilatation in all segments except for segment III, where there was an internal-external biliary drain and a biliary stent.
There were numerous enlarged porta hepatis lymph nodes.
A small anterior pelvic wall hernia and small pleural effusions were noted.
A cardiac workup was started with TTE noting LVEF of 45-50%, mild to moderate MR, mild pulmonary systolic HTN.
Of note, on [**2-12**], she had an episode of L chest pain when transferring from chair to bed.
She had no further episodes of chest pain.
Findings were notable for a Klatskin type biliary stricture at confluence of central right and left ducts extending to upper common hepatic duct (obstructive on right), this was balloon dilated.
Post procedure, she was hypertensive requiring iv hydralazine.
A chest CT was recommended to evaluate for any possible metastatic lesions for staging.
This showed a few scattered peripheral lung nodules as described, with the largest measuring 5 mm in the right upper lobe.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and mild intralobular septal thickening at the lung bases was noted.
A density in the subcarinal station may represent fluid in a pericardial recess versus an enlarged lymph node.
Calcified granuloma in the lung and several in the spleen were consistent with prior granulomatous exposure.
