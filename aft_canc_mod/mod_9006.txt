These findings suggest variable ages of hemorrhage within a pituitary macroadenoma.
The infundibulum is mildly displaced.
The major flow voids within the cavernous sinus appear preserved.
FINDINGS: There is evidence of an aplastic sphenoid sinus.
The cribriform plates are intact, with an approximately 4 mm depression of the cribriform plate.
Atherosclerotic calcifications of the cavernous portions of the carotids are seen bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: Aplastic sphenoid sinus, noted for preoperative planning for pituitary adenoma resection.
Labs on Discharge [**2149-5-20**]: WBC Hgb   Hct    Plt 7.5 11.4  33.5   389  Glu BUN  Creat  Na    K    Cl   HCO3 72  15   0.8    138   4.4  105  26   Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the surgical ICU after being transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further managment of his hyponatremia and newly diagnosed pituitary mass.
Upon admission, he was neurologically intact, without complaint of visual disturbance despite reports of such from the transferring hospital.
MRI of the head, and CT of the skull base was done to further characterize the pituitary mass for surgical planning.
He tolerated this procedure well, and was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit post-operatively to be monitored for diabetes insipidus, and further correction of his hyponatremia.
Due to his hyponatremia he was kept in the hospital over the weekend.
The patient also had urinary retention and required his foley to be replaced.
