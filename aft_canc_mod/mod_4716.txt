On mental exam, the patient had some disorientation to year and difficulty with complex pictures but otherwise, was attentive, appropriate with intact recall.
Neurology felt she was clearing from sedation and anesthesia appropriately.
She was seen by physical therapy on POD7 ([**1-28**]); a CTA of her abdomen was done to evaluate the blood vessels and assess status of a known bile leak; the CT showed "Patent hepatic artery which originates from the aorta, Patent portal veins and hepatic veins; Small thrombus seen at the confluence of the middle and left hepatic veins; Small fluid collection anterior to the aorta, and larger fluid collection extending from the superior surface of the liver posteriorly.
Multiple peripheral low attenuation regions, small scattered throughout the liver".

This was normal and showed no bile leak.
