ED cardiologist saw him here and noted hypotension to the 80s although the patient was mentating and had good urine output.
An echocardiogram was done in the ED (by the cardiology fellow) which showed reduced EF from [**4-14**] and septal WMA consistent with possible missed anterior MI.

ACUTE ISSUES #Shock: Multifactorial: The initial presentation included a broad differential of cardiogenic shock, septic shock, and adrenal insuffiency.
Cardiogenic shock in the setting of recent anterior MI causing hypokinesis of anterior wall and cardiomyopathy and poor outflow from the heart.
Septic in setting of positive blood culutures growingout strep bovis.
Source of infection could be prostetic aortic valve endocarditis, initially coming from gut vs mouth.
He was initially intubated after flash pulmonary edema ensued in the ED s/p fluid bolus for hypotension and then put on levophed and dopamine for pressor support while concominantly adding a lasix gtt for diuresis of pulmonary edema.
Stress dose steroids were also initiated as the patient was chronically on decadron for menigiomas.
He then self-extubated without complications.
Shortly after, troponin and CK-MB were noted to be drastically elevated at 7.58 and 99.
And although there was evidence of septic shock on initial presentation as he met SIRS criteria and we had [**4-6**] BCx positive for Strep Gallalyticus, he clinically did not appear septic as there were no pressor requirements and no IVF was given.
The patient was initiated with ceftriaxone to treat his bacteremia and the steriods were tapered down to his home dose.
Patient was discharged on Levaquin (10 day regimen) for treatment of possible community acquired pneumonia.
He will be discharged on all oral medications to treat his presumptive bacteremia/endocarditis and pneumonia.
Hospice will initiate his home O2 requirement  #Episodes of resp distress: The patient had multiple episodes of shortness of breath and anxiety after extubation.
Pt has tachy, HTN and incr RR and lower sats in the 80s when these occurred.
It was felt to be episodes of flash pulmonary edema which responded to morphine, nitro dri, lasix.
It is unclear why pt continues to have these episodes.
Likely a combination of anxiety, tachycardia/HTN causing increase in afterload, and ongoing ischemia which ultimately led to flash pulmonary edema.
Along with addition of Metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **], we added captopril to decrease his flash pulmonary edema.
We gave lasix PRN and morphine PRN for episodes of resp distress.
To help with his anxiety and delerium we started him on zyprexa.
# Rhythm: Pt had episodes where he had PVCs and also had episodes of atrial tachy and pt was started on amiodarone.
# Coronaries: Patient presenting with acute cardiac decompensation in setting of ischemic/septic embolic cardiomyopathy.
He likely had a missed anterior MI vs septic embolic event with worsening EF new septal akinesis-dyskinesis.
Family did not want any interventions did not want cath lab  # [**Last Name (un) **]: Likely from CHF with intravascular low volume.
#Hyperglycemia Pt was put on Insulin sliding scale  CHRONIC ISSUES:  # meningiomas: At first we gave stress dose steroids in setting of shock then we he was better we   continued home decadron 3mg.
Ranitidine 150 mg PO BID   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 2188**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: decompensated CHF, endocarditis Secondary: coronary artery disease,pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You came to the hospital because you had shortness of breath.
While you were here we found a bacteria growing in your blood and we treated you with IV antibiotics called ceftriaxone.
It is most likely that the bacteria in your blood is from an infection in your heart called endocarditis.
While you were here you also became agitated and upset at times and then became short of breath.
This is for your infection of the heart please START amiodarone 200 three times a day which you will take for 3 wks then 200 daily starting on [**2140-8-8**] This is for your heart rate which can become fast at times Please start ZYPREXA please START levofloxacin 750 mg every other day for 10 days  Followup Instructions: We have schedule cardiology and infectious disease appointments for you.
