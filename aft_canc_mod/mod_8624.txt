ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly EXT: no c/c/e SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice/no splinters NEURO: AAOx3.
CXR on admission: 1) Persistent loculated left effusion with increasing fluid within the left pleural cavity and new partial left lower lobe atelectasis.
2) New mild pulmonary edema.
3) New small right pleural effusion.
ECHO [**2173-3-25**]: Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Elevated left ventricular filling pressures.
Mild aortic stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild to moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Very small to small anterior pericardial effusion.
CARDIAC CATH [**2173-3-26**] (PRELIMINARY REPORT): Coronary Angiography- Right domimant LMCA- Stent widely patent.
Because of the proximal mild lucency, it was interrogated with pressure wire that showed FFR of 0.92 indicative of no significant disease.
LAD- Patent mid LAD stent with 30% ISR, no other significant disease LCX- Small vessel with no significant disease RCA- All stents are widely patent.
Mild mid PDA disease.
Mildly elevated LVEDP 3.
Minimal aortic valve gradient .
There is mild senile calcification of the tracheobronchial tree.
The aorta and great vessels are normal in caliber and contour, though dense calcification of the aorta, as well as dense calcification of the right and left coronary arteries, is noted.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There is no mediastinal or hilar adenopathy identified.
Calcification of the aortic valve is also noted.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions, though the effusion on the right has slightly increased compared to [**2172-11-18**].
On the left, the amount of pleural fluid is likely unchanged, also simple fluid in attenuation.
There is a focal higher-density region at the periphery of the lingula and left lower lobe, which might represent rounded atelectasis, which appears slightly larger than on the prior study.
Within the lungs, there is a small calcified granuloma seen at the left base (2:25).
There are no additional pulmonary nodules or masses identified.
Apical pleural scarring is seen bilaterally.
Hyperdense material in the upper pole of the left renal collecting system likely represents retained contrast from cardiac catheterization performed one day prior.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions identified.
Bilateral small simple pleural effusions, likely unchanged on the left and slightly increased on the right.
Probable subpleural rounded atelectasis/collapse in the lingula and left lower lobe, slightly worse in appearance since the most recent comparison of [**2172-11-18**].
The oval hyperdense mass previously seen in the pleural space anteriorly adjacent to the lingula on [**2172-11-18**] might also represent a focus of atelectasis/collapse.
Recommend followup imaging after resolution of pleural effusions to assess stability of findings.
Dense aortic and coronary atherosclerotic calcification, with additional calcification of the aortic valve.
Retained contrast within the renal collecting system secondary to recent cardiac catheterization.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 y/o F PMH significant CAD s/p stents, DM, hyperlipidemia, HTN who presented with shortness of breath of 2 days duration, found to have large pleural effusions and was diuresed.
On discharge breathing well, but continued to have drenching night sweats which will require very close outpatient follow-up.
# Pleural effusions/Acute Diastolic Heart Failure: Most likely secondary to CHF and pleural effusion.
Patient reports recent increase in salt intake (Chinese, Pizza over the weekend).
Pleural effusion (chronic) most likely secondary to CHF but other possibility is malignancy based on CT scan last admission with ?
CXR demonstrates loculated left pleural effusion and left lower lobe collapse.
Transthoracic echocardiogra showed preserved EF, 1+ MR, and elevated left ventricular end-diatolic pressures.
Repeat imaging showed improvement in pleural effusions after diuresis and no thoracentesis was pursued.
The possibility of malignant effusions cannot be ruled out.
Repeat CT of the chest reported that they hyperdense mass commented on CT from [**2172-11-18**] is most likely rounded atelectasis, and not a mass; however repeat imaging after resolution of pleural effusions is recommended.
The patient has had thoracentesis on previous admissions sent for cytology and found to be negative for malignancy.
She may benefit from repeat diagnostic thoracentesis in future if pleural effusions reaccumulate.
# Type B symptoms:  Pt reports several months of night sweats and indeed had drenching night sweats while an inpatient.
She also notes a [**10-7**] pound weight loss over past 2-3 months.
These symptoms are highly concerning for occult malignancy or chronic infection.
There was a concerning area on Chest CT from [**2172-11-18**] which seemd more likely to represent rounded atelectasis on repeat CT from this admission.
Follow-up imaging is recommended after resolution of pleural effusions.
Of note, thoracentesis from [**2172-11-18**] was consistent with transudative process and cytology was negative for malignancy.
# CAD: EKG on admission t-wave flattening and inversions anterior leads.
Patient had episode of acute nausea/diaphoresis [**2173-3-25**] with EKG changes borderline ST elevation V1/V2, depression V4-V6.
Patient with mild diaphoresis morning [**2173-3-26**] and continued to have ST depressions V4-V6.
Troponins increased in setting of worsening renal function, but CK-MB remained flat.
Patient started on a heparin drip and underwent cath which demonstrated no in-stent thrombosis.
Likely secondary to chronic kidney disease with a question of contribution from other systemic source of inflammation (?
Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
# Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Improved from baseline.
Losartan was held as patient was at high risk of contrast nephropathy following cath, last cath on CVVH due to renal failure.
Pt did develop contrast induced nephropathy after cath with Cr peaking at 3.3.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued lipitor.
# Hypertension: Continued Hydralazine, Norvasc, Metoprolol .
# Transition of Care: -Pt requires close follow-up for highly concerning symptoms of persistent night sweats and weight loss.
-Pt needs follow-up chest imaging with resolution of pleural effusions.
