Note: Sections show tracheal mucosa, cartilage, and fibrous tissue with an extensive lymphoid infiltrate composed of small lymphocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils, histiocytes and scattered large atypical lymphoid cells.
These large atypical lymphoid cells have multiple nuclei, with large eosinophilic nucleoli, and abundant pale to eosinophilic cytoplasm and correspond to classic or diagnostic [**Doctor Last Name **]-Sternberg cells.
CD3 and CD5 highlight background small lymphocytes.
CD10 and CD15 highlight background stromal cells and neutrophils, respectively.
Cytokeratin cocktail (AE1/AE3/CAM5.2) does not stain the large atypical lymphoid cells.
MIB-1 fraction among RS cells is high (80%).
Overall, the morphologic and immunophenotypic characteristics are in keeping with classic Hodgkin lymphoma (WHO classification).

INDICATION: History of mediastinal mass, status post tracheal stent placement with fracture, evaluate stent position, fistula.
Posterior dependent intraluminal opacity is demonstrated most consistent with secretions and a possible element of granulation tissue.
Note is made that the amount of intraluminal material changes from series 3 becoming less pronounced on repeat scanning on series 7.
A small linear lucency is seen extending from the right lateral margin of the distal trachea extending into the esophagus consistent with a tracheoesophageal fistula.
Distal to the stent there is persistent severe proximal narrowing of the right main stem bronchus.
Evaluation of the soft tissues again, demonstrates diffuse abnormalities with extensive bulky lymphadenopathy extending from the right supraclavicular region into the superior mediastinum and into the right hilar and subcarinal regions.
Allowing for differences in technique with contrast on the current study this appears not significantly changed.
The previously described involvement of the trachea and esophagus with lack of a discrete fat plane between the posterior wall of the trachea and esophagus is also redemonstrated.
There are no new lesions identified.
Assessment of the lung parenchyma demonstrates no focal areas of consolidation or effusion.
Scattered heterogeneous areas of lung attenuation could be due to air trapping during relative expiratory phase of scanning.
The osseous structures demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Findings consistent with interval development of tracheoesophageal fistula at the distal right lateral margin of the trachea.
No significant interval change in extensive conglomerate nodal masses and soft tissue abnormalities as described previously.

A stent remains in place within the trachea extending to the carinal region.
There has been interval placement of a left PICC line, which terminates in the superior vena cava.
There remains widening of the right mediastinal and hilar contours, although this appears improved compared to the earlier study of [**4-8**] and slightly improved compared to the more recent study of [**4-9**].
There are patchy areas of consolidation within both lower lobes and there is also a layering right pleural effusion, which has increased in the interval.
A small left pleural effusion is considered unchanged.
Previously noted septal lines and perihilar haziness on the left have improved.
IMPRESSION: Improvement in pulmonary edema with resolution of septal lines and decreased left perihilar haziness.
Residual asymmetrical right perihilar haziness and patchy bibasilar consolidations may reflect residual dependent pulmonary edema or superimposed process such as atelectasis or aspiration.
Slight increase in right pleural effusion and stable left pleural effusion.

Thrombus in the left basilic vein was suspected on limited son[**Name (NI) 493**] evaluation without Doppler.
COMPARISON: No previous studies.
The left basilic vein and bilateral cephalic veins could not be identified, which may be related to technical limitations secondary to the patient's body habitus.
On the left, there is an occlusive thrombus in one of the two brachial veins and in the axillary vein.
On the right, there is an occlusive thrombus in the internal jugular vein, which expands the vein.
No intraluminal thrombus is identified in the subclavian, axillary, brachial, or basilic veins, which demonstrate normal color flow and waveforms.
Occlusive thrombus in one of the left brachial veins and in the left axillary vein.
