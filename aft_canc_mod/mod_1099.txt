STRONGYLOIDES STERCORALIS .
Streaky opacities are seen in both lung apices, with associated right apical pleural thickening are unchanged and may relate to mild chronic fibrotic changes.
There is minimal bibasilar atelectasis without focal consolidation.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary pathology.
CT HEAD W/O [**2124-4-17**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
KUB [**2124-4-17**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of small bowel obstruction or ileus.
No free air in the abdomen.
CXR [**2124-4-18**] FINDINGS:  Some mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely reflects minimal effusion and possibly some minimal atelectasis.
Heart size appears mildly enlarged.
There is no gross acute consolidation or pneumothorax.
Incidental note is made of a small focus of calcification projecting adjacent to the greater tuberosity which may reflect calcific tendinitis.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE: Pt is an 80 yo F with T2DM, CKD, CHF with EF 15-20% ([**10/2123**]), and asthma with hx of recent diverticulitis in [**Male First Name (un) **] c/b sepsis, has been at home for the last few days, doing well until the family noted her to be altered [**2-18**] morning, found to be hyponatremic and febrile.
# Toxic metabolic encephalopathy: Most likely [**2-2**] profound hyponatremia.
CT head negative for intracranial process.
# Fevers: Presented with fever to 102.5 in the ED.
Possible sources of infection include abdominal process such as diverticulitis, PNA, viral URI, UTI, and less likely meningitis, or C. diff vs. endocarditis.
Given history of recent diverticulitis, abdominal source was possible.
Viral URI or influenza certainly possibly given high fevers.
C. diff certainly possibly given diarrhea and recent abx use.
However, per recent discharge summary, it was noted that pt has had chronic guaiac positive diarrhea with negative C. diffs previously.
On further testing, she was found to have Strongyloides infection.
This medication was not continued on discharge and she had been afebrile for many days.
# Hyponatremia: chronic issue, thought to be hypovolemia given fevers and insensible losses.
Previously has been severely hyponatremic, as low as 114 in [**10/2123**], [**2-2**] hypervolemic hyponatremia given systolic congestive heart failure.
She was thought to have either SIADH or reset osmostat and placed on a fluid restriction.
DDx included volume overload given h/o CHF, vs. infectious such as PNA or viral bronchitis on top of known COPD vs. PE.
PNA thought unlikely given no cough and no infiltrate on CXR.
Pt may have viral bronchitis in addition to baseline lower O2 sats given COPD.
PE possible, but given no tachycardia, no chest pain, this was less likely.
Pt has no O2 requirement on the floor.
# Rash: Diffuse rash on anterior lower extremities.
Pt has had recent medication changes while in PR.
Derm was consulted but did not recommend intervention or treatment.
The diagnosis was dermatitis NOS and the rash subsided over the hospitalization.
# Chronic systolic heart failure: EF from [**10/2123**] of 15-20%, she appeared dry on first exam and was given IV fluids.
# CKD: Baseline Cr 1.3-1.4, and Cr on admission is 1.2.
BUN is slightly up, but likely [**2-2**] hypovolemia as above.
# Anemia: chronic.
Last iron studies suggestive of ACD given elevated ferritin, low TIBC.
Per further discussion with family, she had rectal bleeding in PR, but has had none since returning home.
# Hypokalemia: Most likely [**2-2**] GI losses, has chronic loose stools.
Her K on discharge was 4.3 without repletion .
Hyponatremia: chronic but patient known to have episodes of hyponatremia 110s with obtundation.
She was fluid restricted and sodium increased to mid-120s but did not increase beyond that.
There is some debate whether she has SIADH vs. reset osmostat but we elected not to persue this with a diagnostic fluid bolus.
She should not take Metolazone or any other thiazide diuretics as this would aggravate her hyponatremia.
If her hyponatremia persists, she should have SIADH workup including CT chest/MRI head.
IF diarrhea ongoing, would repeat stool studies and consider treatment for complicated course (7-10days Ivermectin)   [**Month/Day (2) **] on Admission: [**Month/Day (2) **] per most recent discharge: -fluticasone 50 mcg/Actuation Spray Two Spray Nasal [**Hospital1 **] -omeprazole 20 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)

Discharge Instructions: Mrs. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to the [**Hospital3 **] Medical Center for fever and low blood pressure and being weak and tired.
You were found to have low sodium levels in your blood and this was partially corrected by giving you sodium in your veins.
You also found to have significant weakness by our physical therapists.
You also have a parasitic worm infection in your digestive tract and have received a medication called Ivermectin.
But you should report ongoing diarrhea or abdominal pain or fevers to your primary care physician.
