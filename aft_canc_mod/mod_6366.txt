History of Present Illness: This delightful and energetic 85-year-old woman recently presented to our Medical Center with fever and bacteremia.
She was worked up, and found to have a mass in her left upper quadrant.
This ultimately figured to be a diverticular abscess that resolved with antibiotic care.
However, in the workup of this, an incidental finding of a pancreatic head mass was noted on an abdominal CT.
Coronary artery disease with history of angioplasty in [**State 108**] one year ago 2.
Atrial fibrillation 4.
Hyperlipemia 5.
Hypertension 6.
Chronic kidney disease (SCr 2.1 in [**3-17**]) 7.
Anemia (HCT 30.7 in [**3-17**])  Social History: The patient lives alone in [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], which has an indoor pool and denies having any stairs.
Family History: Father had a GI tumor, primary unknown.
Another daughter with ovarian carcinoma.
Physical Exam: General:  An 85-year-old woman in a wheelchair, does not appear to be in acute distress, however, was worried because when she tried to get on to the bus today, her right leg gave out and since then she feels her right leg is slightly weak.
No lymphadenopathy felt.
No bruits noted.
Cardiovascular:  Irregularly irregular, could not hear any murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities:  Mild edema present in the left lower extremity, especially in the ankle area.
No calf muscle tenderness noted.
The patient did have difficulty getting up from the wheelchair and could not get up from the wheelchair without using the support of the arms of the wheelchair.
She did have a little weakness while getting up from the wheelchair on to the examination table for her right leg.
Interstitial changes of the lung apices with additional patchy consolidation.
Recommend clinical correlation for pneumonic consolidation.
Post-surgical changes associated with prior Whipple's procedure.
Loculated fluid in the surgical bed and surrounding the mesenteric root could represent postoperative seromas; very early fluid collections could appear similarly.
Large subacute hematoma in right subcutaneous fat, subjacent to the skin staples.
Mild periportal edema.
Pancreatic head mass, Whipple procedure (B-O): Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with secondary involvement of the duodenum; see synoptic report.
EXTENT OF INVASION  Primary Tumor:  pT3:  Tumor extends beyond the pancreas but without involvement of the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery.
Additional Pathologic Findings:  Chronic pancreatitis, acute duodenal serositis.
The specimen consists of a distended gallbladder that measures 9 x 4.8 x 2.7 cm.
No cystic duct lymph node is identified.
No discreet masses or lesions are noted.
The pancreatic portion is composed of a pancreatic head that measures 5 x 3.5 x 3 cm.
The specimen is inked as follows: blue = pancreatic parenchymal margin, [**Location (un) 2452**] = uncinate process margin, yellow = posterior retroperitoneal margin.
This area extends to within 1.0 cm of the posterior retroperitoneal yellow inked margin.
The specimen is represented as follows: B = common bile duct margin, C = pancreatic parenchymal margin, D = uncinate process margin, E = proximal duodenal margin, F = distal duodenal margin, G = ampulla, H = duodenum, I-N = white firm area in relation to surrounding structures, O = remainder of peripancreatic adipose tissue.
The specimen is opened along the antimesenteric surface to reveal unremarkable small intestinal tan mucosa.
[**2140-5-30**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**5-28**], there is some continued, rather ill defined area of increased opacification in the right upper zone.
This appears to be decreasing, consistent with clearing consolidation.
No esophageal spasm.
No tertiary waves observed.
She required ICU level care for rapid atrial fibrillation requiring IV Amiodarone as well as vigorous diuresis for CHF, then was subsequently transferred to the floor once the afib was stabilized on PO Amiodarone.
Cardiac enzymes were flat, and she had no ischemic changes on her EKG.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 426**] had persistent leukocytosis with low grade fevers.
She had a pseudomonas UTI which was treated with Ceftazidime and then underwent chest and abdominal CT which showed some patchy consolidation in both apicies.
A repeat urine culture on [**2140-5-30**] grew enterococcus and subsequently Linazolid was started on [**2140-6-1**]  Her surgical staples were removed on [**2140-5-30**], and she subsequently had some wound dehiscence, mainly old blood.
The wound was cultured, and she had moist-to-dry dressing changes [**Hospital1 **] from that point on.
From a GI standpoint, she was maintained on cyclic tube feeds and also had a speech and swallow evaluation for dysphagia, which did not reveal any dysphagia or aspiration.
Due to ongoing epigastric discomfort, an Upper GI Barium Swallow without KUB was performed on [**2140-6-2**], which revealed age-related diminished motility changes, otherwise unremarkable.
Due to her prolonged hospitalization and deconditioning, she was discharged to rehabiliation facility for continued physical therapy with the hopes of returning home eventually.
