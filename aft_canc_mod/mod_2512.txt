Admission Date:  [**2189-7-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2189-7-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2144-6-8**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 139**]  REASON FOR ADMISSION:  The patient was admitted for a CAT scan that showed a mass as an outpatient.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 45-year-old previously healthy male who was in his usual state of health until two weeks prior to admission when he had left upper quadrant abdominal pain, fevers, and constipation.
Blood drawn from that admission showed an increased white blood cell count, and the patient was sent to the Emergency Department with a question gastrointestinal infection.
His antibiotics were then changed again, and he had an abdominal CT which showed a duodenal mass, and the patient was admitted.
The patient has had a increase in hiccups and a 20-pound weight loss for the past two weeks.
He had no change in his appetite.
No night sweats, no lightheadedness, no changes in bruising or bleeding, no lymph nodes, no melena, no hematemesis or hematochezia, frequency, urgency, hematuria, cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:   He has a family history of diabetes mellitus.
In general, he was a tall, thin, African-American male who was talkative and pleasant, in no acute distress.
The neck was without lymphadenopathy and jugular venous distention.
No murmurs, gallops or rubs.
The abdomen was normoactive, nontender, and mildly distended.
There was visible aortic pulsations.
Extremities revealed no edema or cyanosis.
His skin was without rash or ecchymoses.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A CT of the abdomen showed a duodenal mass abutting the aorta.
There was no lymphadenopathy.
There was a small low attenuation lesion on the liver.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medicine Service for evaluation of his abdominal mass.
On hospital day two, he did receive a percutaneous biopsy of his abdominal mass.
The results of this biopsy were initially sent to [**Hospital6 1708**] because of a question of lymphoma as a differential diagnosis, and when it was realized that this was not a lymphoma, the biopsy specimen was sent back to [**Hospital1 188**].
It was there that the diagnosis of duodenal adenocarcinoma was made.
Oncology and Surgery were both consulted on this patient, and it was felt that treatment of the mass and cancer most likely could not be offered except for palliative care and relief of the partial small-bowel obstruction caused by the mass.
The lesions did appear cystic in nature, and it was recommended that he receive CT and magnetic resonance imaging followup after surgery for these lesions.
The patient also had GGT and CEA levels drawn; both of which were elevated with a GGT of 265 and a CEA of 12.
These possibilities of liver metastases will be followed up after palliative relief of his partial small-bowel obstruction.
PARTIAL SMALL-BOWEL OBSTRUCTION:  The duodenal adenocarcinoma was causing a partial small-bowel obstruction of his duodenum.
The patient was admitted and initially given a clear diet that he could not tolerate and reacted to with bilious vomiting.
However, the peripherally inserted central catheter line became a source of a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and had to be removed.
His peripherally inserted central catheter line was pulled, and the culture tip also grew out methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
SUPERIOR MESENTERIC VEIN CLOT:  This clot was most likely secondary to mass effect of his duodenal adenocarcinoma impinging on the superior mesenteric vein.
The patient received a Vascular Surgery consultation, and they recommended that he be anticoagulated because of his superior mesenteric vein clot.
He was started on a heparin drip with the intention of putting him on Coumadin anticoagulation postoperatively, after his likely gastrojejunostomy for relief of his partial small-bowel obstruction.
The patient also had a superficial thrombophlebitis of his left antecubital vein where his peripherally inserted central catheter line had been.
He had no evidence of deep venous thrombosis of his left arm with no edema or swelling, and he was already on heparin anticoagulation for his superior mesenteric vein clot.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient had occult blood in both his emesis and stool.
This was likely thought due to his duodenal adenocarcinoma oozing blood.
A workup of this anemia showed a very low reticulocyte index which was inappropriately low for his degree of anemia.
He most likely has some bone marrow suppression from his Staphylococcus bacteremia as well as possible anemia of chronic disease from his duodenal adenocarcinoma.
He was also most likely oozing blood through his adenocarcinoma, given him a contribution of iron deficiency anemia.
It was thought that this was most likely due to malnutrition because he has not eaten and had to be taken off his total parenteral nutrition because of his peripherally inserted central catheter line infection.
His magnetic resonance imaging did not show any large findings in his liver, and it was unlikely that liver failure is an etiology of this increased INR.
The patient likely has adequate iron storage and is currently blood which will also give him more iron.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  The patient received a brief therapy with total parenteral nutrition before his peripherally inserted central catheter line became a source of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
However, he likely has some degree of malnutrition because of his long nothing by mouth state during this entire admission.
Hopefully, he will be able to resume good oral intake after his partial small-bowel obstruction surgery.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] had an electrocardiogram done to evaluate for question of endocarditis when he initially was found to have Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
This electrocardiogram showed Q waves in II, III, and aVF; which were likely related to a possible old inferior myocardial infarction.
He had no signs or symptoms of chest pain, and an echocardiogram that was ordered to evaluate the possibility for endocarditis was also negative for any wall motion abnormalities or other signs of ischemia.
The echocardiogram was also negative for vegetations, and it was thought very unlikely that Mr. [**Known lastname **] had any endocarditis because of a lack of clinical findings and echocardiogram findings.
