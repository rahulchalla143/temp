She was transferred from NWH with a right frontal hemorrhagic brain mass.
Per patient's husband, she had dramatic behavioral changes 2-3 days prior to admission.
She was subsequently brought to the ER at NWH where head CT showed a right frontal brain lesion and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Past Medical History: stage IV L thoracic rhabdomyosarcoma currently receiving chemotherapy, L breast ca - DCIS s/p lumpectomy.
Physical Exam: On Admission: Vitals: T 98.4; BP 121/71 ; P 114; RR 20; O2 sat 100%  General: lying in bed NAD HEENT: NCAT, dry mucous membranes Neck: supple Pulmonary: decrease lung sounds on L.

Fluent speech with no paraphasic or phonemic errors.
Able to name low and high frequency objects.
Subtle L UMN weakness 4/5 of LUE.
Pertinent Results: CT Head [**2176-1-10**]: stable hemorrhagic mass in the right frontal convexity with stable surrounding edema.
there is local mass effect, and sucal effacement, but no midline shift.
no new areas of hemorrhage.
Echo [**2176-1-11**]: Moderate mitral regurgitation with borderline LV systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No pericardial effusion seen.
There appears to be a mass that impinges on the right atrium - this is probably the mass seen on CXR.
MRI Brain [**2176-1-11**]: 3.1 cm enhancing hemorrhagic mass located in the right posterior frontal lobe with surrounding edema but no midline shift.
No additional enhancing lesions are identified.
CT Head [**2176-1-13**]: Expected post-surgical changes following a right frontoparietal craniotomy, with blood products in the resection cavity and pneumocephalus overlying bilateral frontal lobes.
MRI Head [**2176-1-13**]: Small area of restricted diffusion identified adjacent to the surgical bed, measuring 9 x 7 mm in size, possibly representing a small ischemic area.
With gadolinium contrast, there is a nodular area of enhancement at the medial aspect of the surgical cavity, measuring approximately 6 x 10.3 mm in size in the transverse dimension x 5.3 x 12.8 in coronal projection, possibly consistent with a small residual lesion, followup is recommended.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.

This showed a mass that impinges on the right atrium with preserved cardiac function.
She was on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
At that time she was oriented to self and had a slight left pronator drift.
On [**2176-1-15**] her foley was discontinued, however it needed to be reinserted for urinary retention.Plans to wean at rehab facility.
