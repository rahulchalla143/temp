Pt states that he was in his usual state of health when he went for a biopsy of a left peritoneal lymph node last tuesday.
He tolerated the procedure well and was feeling well until Sunday when he noted significant L flank pain.
Over the course of the day his sxs worsened and pain migrated to his left abdomen as well.
Labs were notable for elevated WBC to 18.9 with 92% neutrophils.
Urine notable for elevated WBC, RBCs and nitrate.
CT abd showed retroperitoneal bleed, slightly enlarged from prior.
IR was contact[**Name (NI) **] and did not feel that the bleeding was excessive, however was concerned for possible pseudoanuerysm based on CT findings and therefore recommended angiogram in AM for further characterization.
He was admitted to the ICU for monitoring given unstable vitals and crit drop.
On the floor, pt is doing well without new complaints.
His pain persists however he states that he had some improvement with the pain meds given in the ED.

In comparison to [**2155-2-11**] exam, there is marked improvement of the left lower lobe opacity.
The known left perirenal left retroperitoneal hemorrhage is slightly larger and has higher attenuation, compared to the prior study done 5 hours earlier.
S/P RF ablation of a left renal mass.
Soft tissue nodule in this RF ablation site, left adrenal lesion, and left para-aortic lymphadenopathy are all unchanged.
Bilateral multiple pulmonary nodules.
[**4-8**] CXR: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position.
Inspirational effort is lower than on the preceding study, which accounts for the more crowded appearance of the pulmonary vasculature which also may represent some increased fluid load.
No new pulmonary abnormalities can be identified on this portable chest examination.
No pneumothorax has developed.
If diagnostic difficulties persist, consider a PA and lateral chest examination or renewed CT to evaluate in more detail the previously identified pulmonary processes as seen on CT in [**Month (only) 404**].
Left retroperitoneal hematoma is poorly visualized and obscures evaluation of the left kidney.
Overall appearance of the heart and lungs is essentially unchanged.
Small right effusion and associated bibasilar atelectasis.
Increase in size of left-sided retroperitoneal hematoma.
Development of anasarca, likely due to resuscitation.
Persistent predominantly cortical enhancement involving both kidneys, indicating an element of ATN.
Brief Hospital Course: 84yo gentleman with RCC, s/p recent aortic lymph node biopsy who presents with flank pain, dropping HCT and evidence of RP bleed on CT. .
# Retroperitoneal bleed with subsequent hemorrhagic shock: Patient admitted with flank pain, 6 point drop in HCT, and intermittently unstable blood pressures, likely due to bleeding s/p recent procedure and elevated INR while on anticoagulation for afib.
CT abd/pelvis revealed a left sided retroperitoneal hematoma with saccular hyperenhancing lesion anterior to the left renal artery, likely representing a pseudoaneurysm.
However, HCT further dropped by 10 points, and given concern for ongoing bleed in setting of further decrease in HCT and worsening pain, patient went to angio for immediate procedure early the following morning.
Was found to have pseudoaneurysm of left renal artery, which was stented via 7 Fr sheath.
However, the patient developed increasing respiratory distress and hypotension, requiring initiation of pressors and intubation.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Patient's Cr elevated from baseline of 1.2 to 1.4 on presentation, with [**Last Name (un) **] felt to be secondary to volume depletion in setting of bleed.
Was also concern for infection given recent intervention and cloudy urine, as well as ATN given recent dye load and possible hypotension.
Cr continued to rise over hospital course as patient developed hypotension requiring pressors.
[**Last Name (un) **] was most likely secondary to ATN in setting of hemorrhagic shock.
# Elevated Potassium: Was likely due in part to worsening renal function.
When EKG demonstrated peaked T waves and K 6.7, he received CaGluc, Insulin+Glucose, and additional kayexalate with subsequent decrease in K.  Plan had been for HD, though initiation of HD deferred as above given goals of care to focus on comfort.
His beta blocker and diltiazem were held in setting of hemodynamic instability, and anticoagulation held given bleed.
# Elevated WBC: WBC elevated in setting of recent intitation of steroid therapy.
No focal source of infection or fever.
CXR did not show any acute cardiopulmonary process, and showed marked improvement of the left lower lobe opacity seen on prior studies.
# GERD: Stable.
# Elevated glucose: [**Month (only) 116**] have been secondary to prednisone use; no known history of DM.
