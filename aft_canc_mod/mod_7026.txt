Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 96.6 BP: 114/64 P: 69 R: 27 O2: 97%RA General: Alert, oriented x 3, no acute distress, cooperative HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: rhonchorous sounds present at the right base > left base, presence of upper airway sounds, no accessory muscle use, no wheezes CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Skin: exfoliative, erythematous rash on arms, legs and torso   Pertinent Results: CT Chest w/o Contrast: [**2185-5-31**] 1.
Bilateral nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions, with associated dependent atelectasis, including left lower lobe collapse, with additional atelectasis seen dependently in the right middle lobe.
There is associated opacification of the left lower lobe bronchi, which may reflect mucus plugging or aspiration.
In the aerated lung parenchyma, there are no focal opacities to suggest pneumonia.
Redemonstration of left apical lung mass, suboptimally evaluated due to respiratory motion, though little change from [**2184-5-21**].
Aortic valvular calcifications, with mild ectasia of the ascending aorta.
Atrophy of the left kidney, with configuration suggesting chronic left UPJ obstruction.
Moderately severe biapical pleural scarring.
Bibasilar and right middle lobe atelectasis with small bilateral pleural effusions, new since prior imaging.
Resolution of the previously described pancreatitis of the tail with a stable 16-mm hypodense lesion which may represent either a pseudocyst or other pancreatic cystic lesion, for example IPMN.
One midline hernia now contains a loop of transverse colon but no evidence for proximal obstruction.
No intra-abdominal collection to account for elevated white cell count.
[**2185-5-30**] RUE U/S: No evidence of right upper extremity DVT.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION WITH RAPID VENTRICULAR RATE: Treated with dilatiazem and metoprolol.
While on broad spectrum antibiotics for HCAP above she developed a leukocytosis of 20 from 5 so she was started empirically on vancomycin oral 125mg po q6hrs and should continue this for after she is finished with her antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia (See below).
She had evidence of continued aspiration on three subsequent evaluations, attributed to delirium and weakness from prolonged hospitalization and multiple infections.
In the setting of her aspiration, elevated WBC, and findings on chest CT she was started on an eight day course of Piperacillin/Tazobactam for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
Hypernatremia: While NPO for aspiration as above patient became hypernatremic.
13. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for sob/wheeze.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Health care associated bacterial pneumonia Aspiration pneumonia Possible C diff colitis Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with a fever and found to have pneumonia.
