History of Present Illness: 77 year-old male with history of seizure and atrial fibrillation on coumadin who presents with intraventricular bleed.
He went to [**Hospital3 **] in Methuan where he was found to have fever 101.2 and leukocytosis of 14.
Head CT was obtained and showed an intraventricular bleed.
Incidental finding was made of a T2 compression fracture and the patient was placed in a C-collar.
He was also found to have a large pulsatile abdominal mass and ultrasound showed a 6 cm AAA.
He developed agitation and dyskinesia.
EEG showed encephalopathy but no seizure activity.
MRI/A with no aneurysm or infarct.
He continued to spike fevers and was started on Vancomycin/Zosyn for empiric treatment of aspiration pneumonia.
The patient was afebrile prior to transfer to the floor.
Denies headache, neck pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain.
Seizure disorder 2.
Atrial fibrillation on coumadin 3.
Hypertension 4.

Intraventricular hemorrhage within the right lateral ventricle and layering both ventricles posteriorly.
Hypodensity with sulcal effacement within the right parietal lobe, which may represent a subacute infarct.
There is equivocal hyperdensity within the right MCA.
Mild dilatation of the ventricles, particularly the third ventricle.
Chronic lacunar infarcts in the left basal ganglia.
Mucosal thickening of the sphenoid sinuses.
There is a possible tiny, nondisplaced, fracture of the left parietal bone, seen on images 43 and 44 of series 3.
There is no associated soft tissue swelling or hemorrhage, and this may alternatively represent a venous channel.
There does not appear to be a nasal fracture on these images, but the nose is not completely included in the study.
The periventricular hypodensity appears to be due to chronic small vessel ischemia, there is not evidence of hydrocephalus at this time.
These may be due to hypertension.
However, given the intraventricular hemorrhage, it may be advisable at some point to obtain an MR, a CTA, or both to evaluate the possibility of an arteriovenous malformation.
T2 compression fracture.
Interventricular hemorrhage as described on head CT scan.
RETROPERITONEAL US  [**2199-1-6**] IMPRESSION: Large fusiform abdominal aneurysm, measuring up to 6cm in the mid abdomen.
No focal consolidations.
ECG Study Date of [**2199-1-6**]  2:43:56 AM Technically difficult study Atrial fibrillation Early R wave progression Extensive ST-T changes Consider left or biventricular hypertrophy .
2) No focal aneurysm, however, there is diffuse broadening of the anterior communicating artery and likely atherosclerotic irregularity of the M1 segment of the right MCA.
3) Stable right posterior parietal encephalomalacia, likely from chronic infarct.
4) Previously questioned left parietal fracture is not seen on today's study and thought to most likely have represented a small venous channel.
Pulmonary hypertension and lung hyperinflation suggests chronic lung disease.
Worsening of pulmonary edema.
An underlying infectious process or aspiration in the right upper lobe cannot be excluded.
Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 6.6 cm in transverse x 6.1 cm in AP x 7.8 cm in craniocaudal dimensions with a dissection of fresh blood between two layers of old thrombus.
Bilateral pleural effusions, emphysematous change and calcified bronchiectasis in the upper lobes.
Pneumobilia in patient status post cholecystectomy.
Enlarged prostate and bladder diverticula.
MRI/A BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**2199-1-10**] IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with interventricular hemorrhage.
No definite evidence of acute infarction.
No definite stigmata to suggest the presence of a [**Year/Month/Day 1106**] malformation.
IMPRESSION: Limited MRA of the Circle of [**Location (un) 431**] with no evidence of major [**Location (un) 1106**] flow abnormality.
Since [**2199-1-6**], decrease in size of intraventricular hemorrhage with stable appearance of enlarged ventricles.
New air-fluid level within the left sphenoid sinus, with a nasogastric tube in place.
Old infarcts of the right frontal and parietal lobes with extensive small vessel infarcts.
BONE SCAN  [**2199-1-18**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of increased tracer activity in the upper thoracic spine suggesting that the known T2 compression fracture is chronic.
PERC PLCMT GASTROMY TUBE  [**2199-1-23**] IMPRESSION: Successful placement of 14 French 63 cm [**Doctor Last Name 9835**] GJ tube with pigtail formed in the duodenum and tip present in the jejunum.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
No evidence of progression of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
No evidence of infection of the aneurysm.
No fluid collections identified in the abdomen or pelvis.
Previously noted small bilateral pleural effusions are predominantly resolved.
Small amount of atelectasis is seen at the right lung base.
Occlusive thrombus also identified within the left basilic vein.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 year-old male with past medical history of seizure disorder, atrial fibrillation on coumadin presenting with intraventricular bleed and incidental findings of T2 compression fracture and 6 cm AAA.
The patient developed MRSA bacteremia with PICC catheter tip positive for MRSA and heparin-inducted thrombocytopenia.
No clear [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] abnormalities on MRA.
Repeat CT head one week after admission showed decrease in size of intraventricular hemorrhage with stable appearance of enlarged ventricles.
Encephalopathy/agitation: Patient appears to have severe inattention following a fall and right intraventricular hemorrhage greater than left with some early hydrocephalus (and pneumocephalus, bone fracture) on imaging; inattention could be due to injury to right side, versus old right-deficits from prior injury or stroke exacerbated in context of toxic-metabolic derangement.
The patient also had akasthesia/dyskinesias on admission that resolved by changing dilantin to keppra.
EEG showed nonspecific encephalopathy.
MRI/A without evidence of infarction or [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] malformation.
This may continue to improve as the patient recovers from his acute insult.
There was no seizure activity noted on EEG.
Renal insufficiency: Creatinine elevated on admission to 1.7 and BUN 55, thought pre-renal with response to fluids.
The decreased creatinine later in admission likely represented decreased muscle mass and was not a true increase in glomerular filtration rate.
Infectious disease: The patient is status post three-day course of ciprofloxacin on admission for presumed urinary tract infection [**1-8**] and eight-day course of Vancomycin/Zosyn [**1-16**] for RUL infiltrate while in MICU.
The patient spiked a fever to 101.8 overnight [**1-22**] with leukocytosis on laboratories.
The persistently positive blood cultures were believed secondary to an endovascular source; hematoma at site of PICC or seeding of the AAA.
Left upper extremity ultrasound was ordered and showed a hematoma the site of previous PICC.
The patient should complete an eight-week course of antibiotics from the first day of negative blood cultures, [**1-28**], to treat the bacteremia complicated by hematoma and possible endocarditis or bone spread.
There were no new murmurs or peripheral stigmata of endocarditis during admission.
TTE was negative for signs of endocarditis and the patient did not tolerated TEE.
No soft tissue source.
Unlikely secondary to osteomyelitis with recent negative bone scan.
Differential includes dental as patient has poor dentition and attempts at NGT placement prior and sinus disease although unlikely with speciation.
Urinalysis negative.
No localizing signs or symptoms.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: The patient was positive for HIT antibodies with optical density > 1.0.
Repair was deferred secondary to the patient's acute illness.
The patient was initially on C-spine protection but this was discontinued per orthopedic recommendations when bone scan showed the fracture was chronic.
Coumadin was initally held for intraventriculat hemorrhage.
Skin lesion: The patient was noted to have a 1 cm round lesion under the right eye with central necrosis.
The appearance is concerning for basal versus squamous skin cancer.
Nutrition: The patient failed Speech and Swallow evaluations on multiple occasions during admission.
Patient had speech and swallow videos while in-house.
Acetaminophen 650 mg Suppository Sig: [**1-8**] Suppositorys Rectal Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
