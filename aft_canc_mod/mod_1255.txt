Admission Date:  [**2148-3-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2148-3-28**]   Service:  MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is an 80 year old woman with a history of hypertension and peripheral vascular disease who presented to her primary care physician in [**2147-11-25**] with a complaint of cough and chest tightness.
The symptoms persisted and the patient had a chest x-ray done on [**2148-3-6**], which showed a large right sided [**Location (un) 21851**] in the paratracheal region.
The patient presented to the Emergency Room on [**2148-2-26**], with significant worsening of dyspnea, wheezing and cough.
CT scan was done which showed a large right upper lobe mass extending into the mediastinum, 7.2 centimeters by 7.7 centimeters, associated with right upper lobe collapse.
There was extensive right hilar and sub-carinal lymphadenopathy with an 8 millimeter nodular density in the right posterior middle lobe and small right pleural effusion.
Unable to do biopsy secondary to patient coughing, discomfort and difficulty visualizing the bronchus.
Repeat bronchoscopy was done on [**2148-3-15**], which showed complete obstruction of the main stem bronchus.
Biopsies taken indicated poorly differentiated carcinoma infiltrating bronchial sub-mucosa.
The patient was admitted on [**2148-3-16**], to [**Hospital3 20445**] for worsening shortness of breath.
The patient underwent a staging work-up with abdominal CT scan which showed no metastases.
While lying flat, the patient became more dyspneic with increasing coughing and obvious cyanosis.
The patient underwent an emergency CT scan which showed progression of disease and compression of the trachea and main [**Last Name (un) 2435**] bronchus.
The patient was sent to [**Hospital1 190**] for emergent XRT and then sent back to [**Hospital3 1196**] for chemotherapy.
The patient reportedly developed increasing cough with periods of bronchospasm and cyanosis despite increasing doses of steroids, nebulizer treatments and heated face mask.
The patient was referred to [**Hospital1 69**] for stenting of her trachea and right main stem bronchus.
Severe peripheral vascular disease on Coumadin status post bilateral femoral-popliteal bypass in [**2127**].
Status post left below the knee amputation in [**2128**] secondary to obstructing clot and left foot ischemia.
In [**2140**], the patient underwent a redo right axillary shunt to lower extremity bypass which was complicated by postoperative pulmonary embolus treated with Coumadin and IVC filter placement.
Non-small cell lung cancer as above.
Cardiovascular:  The patient was tachycardic with no appreciable murmurs, rubs or gallops.
No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is an 80 year old woman with poorly differentiated non-small cell lung cancer admitted with compression of the trachea and right main stem bronchus by a large right upper lobe tumor.
On hospital day one, the patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy with findings of the right upper lobe occluded by tumor; in addition, distal trachea had a near total obstruction by tumor.
Repeat bronchoscopy was performed on hospital day number two, which showed stents to be patent and in good position.
Distal airways were patent as well and mild to moderate secretions were noted bilaterally.
Post-procedure, the patient maintained O2 saturations of 93 to 98% on a 50% face mask (this was her O2 requirement on admission).
The patient did note subjectively improvement in shortness of breath post-procedure.
In addition, the patient was continued on Decadron to help decrease inflammation in the bronchus and was continued on prophylactic antibiotics with Levaquin and Flagyl post-procedure.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged back to [**Hospital3 1196**] for continuing care.
Non-small cell lung cancer with compression of trachea and main stem bronchus status post stent placement.
