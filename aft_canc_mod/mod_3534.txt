He was taken for head CT, which showed a large intraparenchymal bleed with biventricular extension.
While returning from the CT, he had interval worsening of mental status and stopped speaking.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evaluation.
Physical Exam: VS: T 101.4, HR 79, BP 152/62 on arrival, then 123/50 (briefly fell to SBP of 80s, requiring some IVF to return to 110s-130s), RR 16, SaO2 100%/ventilator Genl: intubated, not yet sedated HEENT: ETT in place, NGT in place CV: RRR, nl S1, S2 Chest: CTA w/ vented breath sounds Abd: soft, NTND Ext: warm & dry, lacerations on R leg  Neurologic examination: Mental status: grimaces and withdraws to stim, does not open eyes or follow any commands (not on sedation) Cranial nerves: pupils equal and reactive, 2->1mm bilaterally, no corneal reflex but significant film in eyes, no clear facial asymmetry but ETT in place, +gag.
+tight L basilar cistern and ?beginning of tentorial herniation.
Head CT ([**12-16**]): Intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered in the right caudate nucleus head, possibly hypertensive in etiology.
Sinus rhythm.
Atrial premature complexes.
Modest nonspecific low amplitude lateral T wave changes.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
No acute cervical/thoracic/lumbar spine fracture or malalignment.
Degenerative changes of the lower cervical spine, greatest at C5/6, Lumbar spines.
Atherosclerotic calcifications of the carotid arteries.
[**12-27**] LENI: Age-indeterminate nonocclusive thrombus in the mid to distal right superficial femoral vein.
No areas of consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
Asymmetrical enlargement of left vocal cord, for which further evaluation with direct visualization is recommended as communicated by telephone to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2152-12-27**].
Small left and trace right pleural effusion with adjacent dependent areas of atelectasis.
Distension of intrathoracic esophagus concerning for esophageal dysmotility.
Coronary artery calcifications.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 89yo man with large IPH and IVH s/p fall, transferred intubated from OSH.
On admission, his exam showed a L hemiparesis.
Right basal ganglia hemorrhage: His history, examination and Head CT findings suggest hypertensive basal ganglia hemorrhage as his pathogenesis.
His hemorrhage has been stable over the course of his hospitalization, confirmed by serial neurological examinations and serial head CTs.
The latest CT on [**12-23**] showed slight decrease in the size of hemorrhage and midline shift.
No hydrocephalus developed, though there was an intraventricular extent of hemorrhage.
His neurological examination showed progressive wakefullnes and attention.
Motor function showed bilateral antigravity movement.
After extubation, he gradually developed stridor, upper airway congestion and increased work of breathing.
A chest CT showed supraglottic asymetric (L>R) edema and tracheobronchomalacia.
ENT was consulted and laryngoscopy was performed, showing mild upper airway edema which was attributed to trauma from intubation.
This was discontinued secondary to hypertension.
He was given humidified air, aggressive pulmonary suctioning, Scopolamine patch to assist in reduction of secretions, mouth care, and atrovent and albuterol nebulizers with some improvement.
The ddx included infection of unknown source or post intracranial hemorrhage.
On [**12-21**] he developed 101F fever and found to have UTI (UCx +for pan-[**Last Name (un) 36**] Klebsiella oxytoca).
Due to worsening in respiratory status Flagyl was added on [**12-24**].
His leukocytosis was thought to be secondary to the steroids.
His blood cultures grew out contaminants (1/12 bottles with cornybacterium).
The patient was afebrile for >48 hrs prior to discharge.
Heme: The patient has a history of MDS and has had occasional thrombocytopenia over the hospital stay.
The patient did not need any transfusions during the last five days of hospitalization.
DVT: The patient was found to have a R SFV non-occlusive clot that appeared chronic in appearance.
Given his MDS with low plts and recent ICH, anticoagulation therapy was not initiated.
This improved with IVF and was therefore presumed to be due to pre-renal azotemia.
Upon discharge his Na was still slightly elevated at 147 but trending to nl (145 at [**Hospital1 18**] lab) with the free H20 via his GJ tube.
Nutrition: The patient failed swallowing evaluation and was thought to be at high risk for aspiration.
UTI: The patient was found to have a UTI with urine that grew out klebsiella.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % Solution [**Name (NI) **]: 1-2 puffs Inhalation Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for wheezing.
