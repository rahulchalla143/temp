Given clinical history this is consistent with cryptococcal meningeal inflammation.

MICU COURSE On the morning of [**2172-8-11**], the patient had an unsuccessful LP and worsening mental status.
He had MRI head and spine which showed leptomeningeal involvement.
ID recomended starting acyclovir and vancomycin prophylaxis given staph epi positive cultures in CNS.
His abx treatment for meningitis was also modified to ambisome and flucoazole, while flucytizine was d/cd.
# Cryptococcal meningitis: Pt was found to have recurrence of cryptococcal meningitis by positive CSF cryptococcal antigen test at a titer of >1:64.
However, administration of Flucytosine has proven to be difficult secondary to the patient's frequent emesis and overall poor toleration for PO intake.
The patient's course has further been complicated by persistently elevated ICP.
Patient on IV morphine and fentanyl patch for pain control.
# CMV detectable in CSF: Patient with positive CMV in CSF with negative VL in serum and no active evidence of CMV encephalitis by exam, quantitative levels, and per discussion at ID HIV multidisciplinary rounds.
During hospital stay had 2 ophtho exams negative for retinitis.
MRI with new moderate edema in R frontal lobe around ventriculostomy cath, and nonspecific minimal linear contrast along the cath; no periventricular blood products.
Baseline mental status is AOx2 (not to date) with appropriate answers with slightly slow speech.
#FEN: PICC line / In terms of nutrition, patient unable to take consistent PO due to nausea and vomiting from meningitis.
Per neurosurgery, patient had vanc/zosyn x 3 days periprocedure with first dose within 2 hours prior to incision.
# s/p low grade temperature: Patient with low grade temp to max 100.3 on [**9-20**] overnight but temperature has decreased without treatment (at discharge has been ranging 98-99) with no overt signs of infection.
No leukocytosis or left shift.
Patient without suprapubic tenderness or dysuria.
Also, if spikes temperature, would consider sending patient for abd CT to r/o abcess, collections given 2 foreign bodies in abdomen but currently no increased pain or evidence of infection at VP-shunt or G-J sites.
Pt was continued on his ARV regimen initially, but it was discontinued on [**8-4**] secondary to persistent nausea and vomiting to PO intake per ID.
Low Hct likely due to repeated needle sticks over course of prolonged hospitalization and also anemia of chronic disease.
# Depression: Patient has reported feeling down and depressed and was started on Remeron on [**9-9**].

Discharge Instructions: You were treated in the hospital for recurrent cryptococcal meningitis with antibiotics and anti-fungal agents.
Because of persistently elevated intracranial pressures, you had a lumbar drain placed on [**2172-8-30**], and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt placed by Neurosurgery on [**2172-9-4**].
You required total parenteral nutrition due to nausea and vomiting, and on [**9-16**], [**2172**], a feeding tube was placed, allowing enteral administration of nutrition and medications.
Please continue all your medications except for the following additions and changes: - You will need to take fluconazole (anti-fungal) 400mg daily until [**10-7**], then 200mg daily for lifetime prevention of cryptococcal meningitis - You were also started on Remeron for depression, and on cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) supplementation.
In addition to antimicrobial agents, you were treated with anti-nausea medication and pain medications, with some improvement in your symptoms.
Please call your physician if you notice any changes in your mentation, increased confusion, increased headache, fever, chills, abdominal pain.
