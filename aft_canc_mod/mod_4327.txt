Admission Date:  [**2166-4-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-4-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2090-4-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3227**] Chief Complaint: 2 week history Slurred speech, left sided weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right Craniotomy for Tumor Resection [**2166-4-4**] Peg Placement [**2166-4-10**]   History of Present Illness: This is a 75 year old male who was noted by his family to be more lethargic, sluggish speech, and unsteady gait two weeks prior to presentation.
They noticed on the evening of [**4-1**] that he was fatigued and appeared to not use his left side well and had a left facial droop.
He was brought to an OSH where a CT revealed right sided hemispheric edema of unclear etiology.
Neurosurgery was consulted secondary to mass effect noted on the CT. Further imaging revealed right sided tumor.

No new acute changes are seen.
MRI HEAD [**4-3**]: FINDINGS: Given differences in technique, there has been no significant interval change in size of the large 7.5 x 5.2 x 5.2 cm right hemispheric mass resulting in severe mass effect with approximately 13 mm leftward shift of midline structures.
The mass demonstrates a thick nodular rim of enhancement with more solid enhancement along the superior margin of the mass.
There is extensive surrounding T2 signal abnormality within the adjacent white matter, which may represent vasogenic edema versus tumor infiltration.
The signal abnormality does extend into the mid brain where there is moderate mass effect upon the cerebral peduncle.
There is a small focus of susceptibility artifact within the posterior left temporal lobe, associated with hyperintensity as seen on the post-gadolinium MP-RAGE sequence, which may represent small volume of blood products, though an additional enhancing focus cannot be excluded.
There is no convincing corresponding FLAIR signal abnormality.
There is marked susceptibility artifact throughout the enhancing right hemispheric mass compatible with intralesional hemorrhage.
There are scattered areas of decreased effusion without central decreased diffusion to suggest pyogenic abscess.
There is mass effect upon the right middle cerebral artery, which is displaced superiorly without identifiable focal stenosis.
There is persistent fetal formation of the left posterior cerebral artery with a hypoplastic left P1 segment.
IMPRESSION: The large hemorrhagic enhancing right hemispheric mass exterts moderate mass effect and most likely represents a primary brain tumor such as GBM.
Lymphoma or metastatic disease are much less likely, and the appearance is atypical for infection.
Additional findings in the posterior left temporal lobe are of unclear significance, though more likely represent a small volume of blood products rather than an additional enhancing lesion as detailed above.
CXR [**4-3**]: No previous images.
No vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute pneumonia.
There is a suggestion of some displacement of the lower cervical trachea to the left, raising the possibility of a thyroid mass on the right.
Mass effect is seen on the right lateral ventricle with compression of the ventricle and midline shift.
Expected post-operative changes after partial resection of right frontal and temporal lobe mass, including fluid and gas within the resection bed as well as pneumocephalus.
Surrounding vasogenic edema causes unchanged mass effect, with effacement of the right lateral ventricle and sulcal effacement.
Small amount of blood product in the resection bed, likely mostly residual from prior hemorrhage.
No new large intracranial hemorrhage seen.
NOTE AT ATTENDING REVIEW: Clearly, MRI scanning will provide more accurate assessment of the true extent of tumor debulking than the present non-contrast CT scan.
Mild bibasilar atelectasis and questionable small left pleural effusion.
MRI brain [**2166-4-5**]: There is a large area of restricted diffusion, posterior to the tumor debulking site which involves the cortex and white matter of the right temporal lobe, suspicious for an acute infarct.
There is extensive heterogeneous T2 signal and susceptibility within the tumor resection bed, which could be Surgicel, blood, or a combination of the two.
Following intravenous contrast infusion, there is also extensive enhancement, which suggests that the tumor was not completely removed.
There is marked mass effect and continued subfalcine herniation.
The left lateral ventricle remains moderately dilated, of concern for obstruction at the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**].
There does appear to be a mild degree of right sided hippocampal herniation.
There is high T2 signal in the left mastoid sinus, likely indicating an ongoing inflammatory process.
CONCLUSION: Likely development of infarction posterior to the tumor resection bed.
Prominent subfalcine herniation and contralateral left lateral ventricular dilatation.
Residual hemorrhagic foci within the surgical resection bed.
Marked mass effect, with leftward subfalcine herniation and moderate dilation of the contralateral ventricle, similar to prior study.
Though the initial diagnosis entertained was a hemispheric CVA, CT suggests an underlying mass.
MRI confirmed a right fronto-temporal contrast enhancing lesion measuring 6 x 5 x 5 cm with significant mass effect.
He was evaluated by speech and swallow again on [**4-14**], and they found that he no longer had any swallowing issues.

You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.
You may wash your hair with a mild shampoo ??????
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.
-An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.
Loss of vision, either partial or total.
Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.
Severe sensitivity to light.
Severe headache or change in headache.
Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
New onset of seizure or change in seizure, or seizure from which you wake up confused.
Due to the complexity of neurosurgical procedures and treatment of neurosurgical problems, effective advice regarding emergency situations cannot be given over the telephone.
Should you have a situation which is not life-threatening, but you feel needs addressing before normal office hours or on the weekend, please present to the local emergency room, where the physician there will evaluate you and contact us if needed.
