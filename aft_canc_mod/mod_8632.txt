Admission Date:  [**2131-8-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2131-9-5**]   Service:  MICU-[**Location (un) 2452**] team  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 8026**] was a pleasant 80-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and hypogammaglobinemia, and liver and brain metastases with unknown primary, who was initially admitted with a brain metastatic bleed and resulting seizure disorder.
He was once admitted to the MICU from [**8-16**] to [**8-17**] for acute respiratory distress which was thought to be secondary to aspiration pneumonia and he was started on BIPAP and then weaned to face mask.
He was ruled in, also, for an MI with a peak troponin of greater than 50.
We were unable to treat him due to his metastatic bleed in his brain, so he was given aspirin and Lopressor.
However, the next day, he developed peripheral eosinophilia and urine eosinophilia which was thought to be secondary to his Zosyn and, so, he was changed to levofloxacin for one dose.
He also had his Quinton catheter pulled out which he was using for his hemodialysis on [**8-19**] because an AV fistula was formed and there was a big left groin hematoma with a drop in blood pressure.
He also had a likely aspiration event on [**8-20**] with possible sepsis and the blood loss in his groin hematoma caused him to become hypotensive.
A CT angiogram was also done to rule out for PE, but that time, bilateral pleural effusions were found.
CT of the abdomen was unremarkable, except for polycystic kidney disease and liver metastasis.
He was being covered with vancomycin, Bactrim, and Ceptaz, but it was believed that his eosinophilia was secondary to his multiple drug interactions, and the patient also developed a drug rash in his axillary area which was also thought to be secondary to drug reaction.
In addition, the patient was still spiking temperatures and, at that time, it was concluded that it could be secondary to a drug fever due to the use of ceftriaxone.
Despite all these multiple attempts for medical treatment, the patient did not show any signs of improvement.
The patient did not respond to sternal rub or any pain sensation.
