No pneumothorax.
Multifocal ground-glass opacities, likely hemorrhage or aspiration.
No pulmonary embolism.
Diffuse ground-glass opacity most pronounced in the lower lobes likely represent aspiration.
Right hilar mass with a right upper lobe medial lung apex opacity with imaging findings of post radiation pnumonitis/atelectasis.
Multiple pulmonary and innumerable liver metastases.
Mass-like mass in the rectum and extension into the mesorectum might represent the patient's primary colon cancer .
There is a left-sided central venous catheter with distal lead tip in the proximal SVC.
There is increased opacification within the left lung apex.
There are areas of consolidation within the left lung, stable.
There are no pneumothoraces.
Brief Hospital Course: 55 year old man with colon and lung cancer who presented with hemoptysis and underwent right main bronchial artery embolization with resolution of his hemorrhage.
# Hemoptysis: Patient initially presented to an OSH where he was emergently intubated after coughing up a "fist sized" clot of blood and transferred for advanced pulmonary and radiology thearpy.
Bronchoscopy revealed a RMS endobronchial lesion that was biopsied with cold forceps.
A BAL of the RUL was done and this was immediately followed by massive bleeding from the RUL posterior segment.
The patient then underwent a right main bronchial artery embolization by IR on [**7-12**] and was successfully extubated on [**7-12**] with small amount of hemoptysis afterward.
He was transferred from the MICU to the general medical [**Hospital1 **] where he remained stable for 48 hours after extubation prior to discharge without recurrence of hemoptysis.
He was empirically treated with vanc and zosyn which was then narrowed to levofloxacin he was discharged to complete a 5 day course of antibiotics for a possible CAP given scattered opacities seen on chest imaging.
Stool was negative for C. diff.
# COLON AND LUNG CANCER:  stable except as above, patient was noted to have extensive metastatic disease as seen on imaging performed at this hospital, but without comparison to outside imaging.
patient seemed unware of the extent of his disease nor his prognosis.
Disp:*5 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: -bronchial hemorrhage -community acquired pneumonia  SECONDARY: -primary lung cancer -metastatic colon cancer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were found to be cough up a large amount of blood and were transfered for skilled care.
You were intubated and had a machine breath for you.
You tolerated this well without ongoing bleeding and were extubated.
