History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 28001**] is a 52 year-old male with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**12/2183**] s/p L1-3 fusion s/s bony metastasis on [**5-27**], who presents with fevers and altered mental status.
Pt was brought to the hospital by his brother who said that while they were driving up from [**State 760**], he became increasing quiet and and less interactive and subsequently developed hallucinations about dead family members.
As per patient, he came to the hospital for worsening low back pain that radiates to his right buttock and thigh.
On exam the patient was oriented to self and location only, often inserting nonsensical sentences, no aphasia.
Patient was noted to be rigoring, with exam significant for rhonchorous right-sided breath sounds in the lower lung fields.
AST and ALT were mildly elevated, with normal total bilirubin, elevated alk phos.
Past Medical History: - Metastatic NSCLC: Pertinent Oncologic history (include past therapies, surgeries, etc): hospitalized from [**2184-3-8**], through [**2184-3-22**];  Bone scan revealed disease within the L2 and T10 through T11 regions; [**2184-3-10**]-a CT scan demonstrated a right upper lobe lung nodule measuring 9 mm and a 7 mm right upper lobe nodule with associated right hilar lymphadenopathy; 1.8-cm lesion within segment VIII of the liver, osseous lesions seen in L2 in the right femur; partial compression deformity was observed in T11.
-severe traumatic brain injury [**2172-9-11**] (It has been sspeculated that he was hit by a car.
He is amnestic for the eevents, but medical records indicate that he had a significant hemorrhagic contusion anteriorly in the right frontal lobe, swelling over the left frontal bone, and diffuse cerebral edema).
Presumed cause was abnormal congenital circulation at the circle of [**Location (un) 431**].
-a full neuropsychological evaluation for attention, memory, and cognitive abilities concluded that his cognitive difficulties are consistent with a right frontal brain injury.
-hypertension  -urinary frequency  s/p laser ablation of the prostate in [**2180**].
Family History: Father died of multi-infarct dementia in [**2171**].
Also with hypertension and there was a question of anomalies in his vascular system.
?s mother died at age 78 of ovarian cancer and breast cancer.

Imaging: [**2185-6-20**] MRI Head: Numerous infratentorial and supratentorial FLAIR hyperintense, ring-enhancing lesions with slow diffusion are new since [**2184-3-15**] MR exam and compatible with metastatic disease.
[**2185-6-20**] Liver or Gallbladder US: Two large liver masses, most likely representing progressed metastatic disease, in patient with known non-small cell lung cancer.
[**2185-6-22**] Transthoracic Echo: No evidence of endocarditis.
[**2185-6-22**] MRI Lumbar Spine: In comparison to [**2185-5-17**], MRI exam, focal signal abnormality of L5 vertebral body has significantly expanded and now involves the  entire vertebral body.
There is interval development of an epidural mass spanning L3-S1 levels as well as large paraspinal mass centered at L5.
Infectious process is favored over metastatic disease, due to the rapid interval development of the above findings, pattern of spread, and areas of hypoenhancement of the epidural soft tissue mass, which most likely represent small abscesses.
Subtle area of meningeal enhancement is also seen in lower lumbar spine, suggestive of associated meningitis.
Right upper lobe collapse is new.
There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
There is a small right pleural effusion.
Right hilar mass is again noted.
There is no pneumothorax.
[**2185-7-1**] Chest X-ray: Since the prior study, there has been some degree of improvement in the right upper lobe collapse which is still present.
Right hilar fullness is noted, consistent with post-radiation changes known from prior chest CT from [**2185-5-17**].
[**2185-7-2**] Chest X-ray: Left PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC.
There is no change in the right mediastinal shift, but there is interval worsening of right upper lobe collapse.
No interval development of pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.
One of the lesions appear slightly larger than on the prior examination and there is increased edema surrounding this lesion and a lesion in the right frontal lobe.
There is evidence for ventriculitis and ependymitis in the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**], which is unchanged.
The findings are suggestive of multiple abscesses.
[**2185-7-3**] Lower Extremity Ultrasound: Left lower extremity DVT as described above, extending from the left common femoral vein to at least the popliteal vein and probably the left calf veins.
Brief Hospital Course: Brief Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 28001**] is a 53 year-old male with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer s/p L1-3 spinal fusion [**1-13**] bony metatasis, who presented with altered mental status and was found to have hyponatremia complicated by SIRS.
Patient was found to have streptococcus anginosus bacteremia and epidural abscess which was the presumed source.
Patient will complete 4 week course of antibiotics for bacteremia and brain abscesses.
MRI on [**6-22**] showed epidural abscess centered around L5 which was the presumed source.
Culture of the abscess contents did not grow any organisms.
# Epidural Abscess: Discovered on MRI on [**6-22**] and was the suspected source of the patient's bacteremia.
The patient's surgery was complicated by high levels of postoperative pain which required epidural placement followed by transition to high levels of opioids.
# Back Pain: Patient had been struggling with back pain ever since his first spine surgery in [**2185-5-13**].
After the surgery for his epidural abscess during this hospitalization, patient experienced higher levels of back pain.
# Right upper lobe collapse: After patient's spine surgery, he developed worsening cough and mild shortness of breath.
Interventional pulmonary was consulted and performed a bronchoscopy on [**7-1**] that revealed tumor obstruction which was not amenable to endobronchial stenting.
# Left lower extremity DVT: There was noted swelling to patient's left lower extremity on [**2185-7-3**].
He did not have leg pain or shortness of breath.
Ultrasound showed a DVT extending from the left common femoral vein to at least the popliteal vein and probably the left calf veins.
Most likely multifactorial due to hyponatremia, bacteremia, and intracranial lesions.
# Hyponatremia: The patient was directly admitted to the ICU for severe hyponatremia with Na 116.
This was most likely due to a combination of hypovolemic hyponatremia (supported by a FeNa of 0.15% and improvement of Na after administration of normal saline) and SIADH (intracranial process or paraneoplastic syndrome), as he was noted to have high urine osmolalities and high urine sodiums.
Patient's sodium was slowly corrected with IV fluids to prevent overcorrection, and he was then started on salt tabs.
# Urinary retention: [**Month (only) 116**] be secondary to narcotic effect or BPH.
The patient's back pain also limits his mobility and makes it difficult for him to void.
Patient failed a voiding trial and is being discharged with an indwelling foley catheter.
# NSCLC: The patient has NSCLC with known mets to the spine and liver.
CT head revealed an old ischemic infarct with has possible metastatic disease.
He received a head MRI which was initially suspicious for metastatic lesions, but in the setting of bacteremia were then thought to be abscesses or a combination of the two.
