History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 7597**] is a 64 year old gentleman with a PMH of MS, and a recent diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome, now being admitted electively for decitabine(15mg/m2 Q8 x3 days), cycle one.
He was diagnosed with MS in [**2154**], and felt that his MS symptoms of fatigue were progressing in the fall of [**2170**], at which point he was found to have progressive LE edema and a new systolic murmur at his [**Year (4 digits) 3390**]'s.
Labs at that time showed pancytopenia, ARF and transaminitis.
He was admitted to the hospital from [**Date range (1) 7599**], with anemia and UTI.
After transfusion of 9 units PRBCs and 6 units of platelets, patient developed volume overload and high-output heart failure (EF>55%), and susequent respiratory, requiring ICU admission, intubation and aggressive diuresis.
ICU course also complciated by slow lower GIB, and partially occlusive L tibial DVT.
Bone marrow biopsy during that admission showed hypercellular marrow with extensive fibrosis, trinlineage dysplasia, and increased myeloblasts.
12% Findings highly suspicious for a myelodysplastic disorder best classified as refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB-2) based on the # of myeloblasts in the peripheral blood.
He continues to have dyspnea on exertion, but this is stable.
He also continues to have neuropathic pain, related to his MS, which includes burning dysethesias, painful vibratory sensations and spasticity.
These symptoms improve with lorazepam.
Also positive for chronic constipation with intermittent hematochezia.
Negative for fevers, chills, weight loss/gain, chest pain, shortness of breath at rest, abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria.
Has been treated with alternative medications and acupuncture after having a bad experience with amantadine.

Right lower lobe opacity is the combination of moderate-to-large right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, underlying infectious process cannot be excluded.
There are no new lung abnormalities.
New opacification at the left base may represent early pneumonia or atelectasis.
Slight decrease in size of moderate right pleural effusion.
Persistent consolidation in the right base is likely atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Subsequent areas of right atelectasis.

Course complicated by hypoxia and hypotension.
CXR showed RLL and LLL infiltrate.
Diarrhea resolved, C. diff negative.
Low retic index.
# Hypoxia: Likely due to recurrent aspiration pneumonia + right-sided pleural effusion considering hypoxia, fever to 102F [**2171-1-31**], tachypnea (RR 30), hypotension, and CXR findings.
Echo [**2170-12-14**] showed LVEF >55%, moderate MR, and mild pulmonary HTN.
He was explained the risks of aspiration including pneumonia and death, but still refused.
Completed a course of cefepime and metronidazole for hospital-acquired pneumonia with neutropenia and history of aspiration (started [**2171-1-30**], stopped day of discharge).
Thoracentesis of right-sided pleural effusion (new since [**12/2170**]) was not done considering infectious risk while neutropenic and no hypoxia or dyspnea.
# Hypotension: Due to sepsis/infection (pneumonia) and hypovolemia (diarrhea +/- furosemide).
# Neutropenic fever: Due to aspiration pneumonia.
Metoprolol stopped [**2171-1-31**] for hypotension (ICU transfer), so restarted at 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].
# Diarrhea: Possibly antibiotic-induced.
Occasional schistocytes reported suggesting a mild compensated DIC as opposed to decreased hepatic synthetic function from malnutrition.
# Multiple sclerosis: Continued lorazepam for spasticity/pain as needed.
Changed dronabinol to scheduled for chronic pain from spasticity.
Indwelling Foley for urinary retention.
He has severe body aches "from head to toe" from neuropathic pain and decreased mobility from spastic paraparesis.
# GI prophylaxis: PPI and bowel regimen.
# DVT PPx: Thrombocytopenia.
# Precautions: Neutropenic.

Hypotension (low blood pressure).
Aspiration pneumonia.
Right-sided pleural effusion (fluid on the lung).
Anemia (low red blood cell count).
Supraventricular tachycardia (fast heart rate).
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for cycle #1 decitabine chemotherapy for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
This three day course was interrupted due to hypoxia (low oxygen levels) and low blood pressure.
Because of the severity of the low blood pressure, you were temporarily transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
A chest x-ray showed a new pneumonia and fluid in the right lung (pleural effusion).
Concern was raised about recurrent aspiration as the cause of your recent pneumonias.
However, you refused a video swallow test because of severe pain from the multiple sclerosis.
After starting this, your blood pressure became very low for a short while and improved with IV fluids.
You blood counts remain low from myelodysplastic syndrome and chemotherapy.
You are also susceptible to infections because of a low white blood cell count.
