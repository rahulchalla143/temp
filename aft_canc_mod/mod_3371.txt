Had stay in ICU for management of DKA, was unfortunately found to have metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and was transferred to oncology service for management.
- Metastatic lesions: CT head and C-spine concerning for metastatic lesions.
Previous MRI L-spine also showed renal mass.
Suspicion for neoplastic process was high.
Suspected to have primary renal carcinoma.
This eventually revealed renal cell carcinoma, suggestive of clear cell type.
- Prerenal Acute kidney Injury: Cr increased to 1.5 from baseline 1.1, improved with IVF.
HOSPITALIZATION SUMMARY: The remainder of his acute and chronic issues throughout his hospitalization are discussed below.
His course by problem is summarized as follows:  1) Diabetic ketoacidosis - As discussed in the ICU course above, Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented with DKA.
He unfortunately has widely metastatic disease to bone and brain.
Prior to presentation, he fell to his right side and suffered pathologic fracture.
An attempt for bone scan resulted in an acute delirious state with severe agitation - the scan was aborted (discussed below).
MRI revealed diffuse metastatic cerebral disease as well, as above.
He underwent orthopedic repair of his pathologic fracture on [**2162-10-22**], after which he received 5 fractions to his right femur as well.
Biopsy during this procedure revealed metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
He received one dose of radiation to a lesion in his distal right humerus as well.
Upon discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname **] had developed a contracture of his right arm, likely secondary to pain from this lesion and cerebral disease.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] suffered a pathologic fracture of his left radius during his hospitalization.
3) Altered mental status - He continued to exhibit altered mental status throughout his hospitalization.
His altered mental status is likely multifactorial.
Initially upon transfer to the floor, he had a large component of ICU delirium and resolving DKA.
Equally significantly, Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a significant amount of CNS metastatic disease burden, including frontal lobe mets - these undoubtedly play a large role in his poor cognition/executive functioning.
Electrolyte abnormalities also contributed to his AMS - hypercalcemia specifically, discussed further below.
Finally, iatrogenic causes of his poor mental status included significant opioid and steroid requirements.
Cerebral edema was controlled with dexamethasone prior to and following WBXRT.
Steroids were slowly tapered while hospitalized; repeat CT scans did not demonstrate rebound edema either to XRT or to steroid taper.
Plans for continued taper and steroid discontinuance were to be addressed at a follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**] of neuro-oncology (he will have an MRI on [**2162-11-29**] prior to this appointment).
This procedure was unfortunately halted due to patient's extreme agitation and aggressive behavior during the procedure.
This pattern of sudden-onset/waxing-and-[**Doctor Last Name 688**] agitation persisted for several days, often triggered by radiation or radiaographic procedures.
This was very obviously demonstrative of hyperactive delirium.
Initial attempts to correct his delirium using frequent redirection, normal sleep-wake cycles when possible, and minimizing benzodiazepines (thought to be disinhibiting frontal lobe behavior).
He required restraints overnight due to acute agitation.
During this episode, he was actively removing his clothes, intravenous lines, therapeutic devices (ankle contracture-prevention boots and pneuamtic compression devices), and surgical dressings.
Follow-up physical examination identified soft tissue swelling and tenderness to palpation of his left wrist.
This was repaired in the OR, and a metastatic lesion was diagnosed at the site of fracture - which corresponded with the site of restraint.
Electrolyte abnormalities were a component of his poor mentation.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was hypercalcemic - likely secondary to a combination of bony metastases (major contributing factor) and paraneoplastic PTHrP (minor factor).
An EEG approximately one week prior to discharge was suggestive of diffuse metabolic encephalopathy.
Ultimately, his altered mental status was attributed to a combination of CNS disease, prolonged hospital stay, and opioids/steroids.
He remained oriented to person and place, and demonstrated increased insight into his condition.
He exhibited word finding difficulties, but was generally appropriate in his communication.
4) Pseudomonas urosepsis - On [**2162-11-5**] he spiked a fever to 103.
Urine and blood cultures grew pan-sensitive Pseudomonas.
He did not spike more fevers, and follow-up blood cultures were negative for bacterial growth.
5) Glucose control - Throughout his stay, he demonstrated a wide range of blood glucose levels.
Per his wife, his type I diabetes was very difficult to control prior to this hospitalization, with periods of both hypo- and hyperglycemia at home.
6) Pain control - Mr. [**Known lastname **] pain control requirement changed throughout his hospitalization.
Upon admission, he required analgesia for control of bony metastasis pain.
He received radiation to right femur and distal right humerus which improved pain control.
Upon discharge, his pain was adequately controlled with hydromorphone 2-4 mg PO Q4H:PRN.
7) Hypertension: Systolic BP initially elevated after extubation in the ICU.
8) Coronary artery disease - Stable throughout his hospitalization.
