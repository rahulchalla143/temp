Prior hospitalization was also notable for PET scan that revealed widely metastatic disease.
He presents today from rehab with acute respiratory distress.
Prior to event, pt denies any fevers or chills, nausea, vomiting.
He has a chronic cough secondary to his lung ca but the quality of the cough did not change.
Of note, pt's recent PMH is notable for rapid progression of metastatic lung SCC.
He started experiencing chronic cough and hemoptysis in [**Month (only) 547**] and symptoms have progressed since.
In [**Month (only) 596**] he was noted to have a large cavitary mass in RLL with satellite nodules suggestive of primary lung Ca.
At the end of [**Month (only) **] he was admitted to osh with fever, leukocytosis and cough and treated with ctx.
At this time a CT showed cavitary lesion as above and a new large r exudative pleural effusion.
As such a chest tube was placed and the cytology came back + for SCC.
Hospital course was notable for r/o PE, attempted pleurx catheter placement on [**6-27**] that failed due to loculated effusions not amenable to pleurx.
At this point a PET scan was done that showed extensive metastatic dz.
He was noted to have bilaterally crackles throughout lung fields, and a power picc was in place in right ac fossa.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.

His respiratory distress was thought to be secondary to aforementioned metastatic disease.
It was discussed with family and patient that his disease was terminal without many further options.
The etiology of death was respiratory distress from lung cancer.
