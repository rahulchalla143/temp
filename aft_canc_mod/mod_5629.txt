Admission Date:  [**2179-2-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-2-25**]   Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: aspirin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1271**] Chief Complaint: Spinal Cord [**Hospital 92077**] transfer from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2179-2-16**]: T2-T5 Lami for tumor resection and biopsy   History of Present Illness: 88-year-old male with penile SCC s/p hemiresection c/b blastic spinal cord disease (C2-4) who presented to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital 1 day ago with difficulty walking x1 week.
At that time he developed difficulty walking and urinary incontinence.
He denies any back pain, saddle or lower extremity anasthesia.
He had an MRI showing a large mass encompassing T2-T5 compressing the spine.
Neurosurgery evaluated the patient, felt that he was not at acute risk for compression when supine so no steroids.

Pertinent Results: Admission [**2179-2-12**] 07:20AM BLOOD WBC-7.2 RBC-2.74* Hgb-8.8* Hct-26.0* MCV-95 MCH-31.9 MCHC-33.7 RDW-14.3 Plt Ct-317 [**2179-2-12**] 07:20AM BLOOD PT-13.3* PTT-29.1 INR(PT)-1.2* [**2179-2-12**] 07:20AM BLOOD Glucose-98 UreaN-36* Creat-2.4* Na-141 K-3.8 Cl-107 HCO3-27 AnGap-11 [**2179-2-12**] 07:20AM BLOOD Calcium-9.2 Phos-2.6* Mg-2.2  CT Tspine [**2179-2-12**]: FINDINGS: There are sclerotic lesions in the vertebral bodies of T2 through T5 with involvement of the posterior elements and the spinous processes.
Sclerotic foci are also seen in the posterior ribs and costovertebral junctions at the levels of T3 through T6.
There is extensive paravertebral soft tissue tumor spread from the levels of T2 through T5 with extensive epidural and neural foramina, better demonstrated on the MR of the thoracic spine from [**2-11**].
Extensive atherosclerotic calcifications of the thoracic aorta, as well as atelectatic changes and small bilateral effusions are seen in the lungs.
Sclerotic metastases involving the vertebral bodies of T2 through T6 (with involvement of the posterior elements and the spinous processes) and the posterior ribs and costovertebral junctions at the levels of T3 through T6.
Extensive paravertebral soft tissue involvement and epidural tumor extension better assessed on the MR of the thoracic spine from [**2-11**].
Sclerotic focus of the left pedicle of C4 might represent a blastic metastasis, less likely a bone island.
Multilevel moderate degenerative changes, most pronounced at C3/C4, C4/C5, and C5/C6.
Levoscoliosis, and moderate-to-severe degenerative changes of the lumbar spine, most pronounced at L4/L5 with severe spinal canal narrowing.
There are no suspicious bony lesions in the lumbar spine.
MRI C/T/L- spine [**2179-2-12**]: Again noted are sclerotic metastases involving T2 through T5 vertebral bodies and spinous processes.
There are degenerative endplate changes at T12-L1.
There is circumferential epidural neoplasm from T2 through T5 with compression of the cord and cord myelomalacia, worse at T2-T3.
Pre- and paravertebral soft tissue is also noted at these levels with extension into the neural foramina bilaterally.
Multiple ribs also demonstrate metastatic lesions bilaterally.
A small sclerotic focus at C4 on the left pedicle at C4 may represent a metastatic focus.
There are multilevel disc osteophyte complexes with canal narrowing and foraminal narrowing.
There are extensive degenerative changes at almost all levels with the most significant and severe canal stenosis at L4-L5 from facet hypertrophy and disc bulge as well as ligamentum flavum thickening.
No convincing metastatic disease is seen in the lumbar spine.
There are degenerative endplate changes at multiple levels.
There is severe right foraminal narrowing at L4-L5.
There is a Schmorl's node at the inferior aspect of L2.
Incidentally noted there is a mass in the right parotid measuring 1.5 x 1.2 cm.
Bilateral small pleural effusions are noted.
There is a left renal cyst.
IMPRESSION: Metastatic disease in the upper thoracic spine with epidural extension and cord compression and cord myelomalacia as detailed above.
Degenerative sequela in the cervical and lumbar spine with the most severe stenosis at L4-L5.
Right parotid lesion- primary parotid neoplasm versus metastasis.
CT Head [**2179-2-13**]: Negative head CT, no lesions noted.
No evidence of definite primary or metastatic disease in the abdomen, or pelvis.
Sclerotic metastatic disease in the upper thoracic spine.
Epidural extension as described on MRI is poorly evaluated on this CT. 3.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Ascending aortic aneurysm measuring 5.5 cm.
Bilateral simple renal cysts.
Bone Scan [**2179-2-15**]: IMPRESSION: Multifocal osseous metastases involving the T2-T6 vertebral bodies, right anterior fourth rib, left posterior sixth rib, and likely the T9 vertebral body.
All lesions with the exception of T9 correspond to sclerotic lesions noted on CT.   Post operative MRI [**2-17**]: .
Postoperative changes in the form of T1 to T5 laminectomies with partial resection of the anterior epidural soft tissue.
These likely represent sclerotic metastases.
Anterior epidural soft tissue at T2 level causing spinal cord compression.
Degenerative changes in the thoracic spine which are unchanged since the prior study.
Brief Hospital Course: 88-year-old male with penile SCC s/p hemi-resection c/b blastic spinal cord disease who was transferred from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital with large mass encompassing T2-T5 compressing the spine.
Acute issues: .
While laying flat he had good strength on admission though morning after admission with mew left lower extremity weakness concerning for acute worsening disease.
Continued to have urinary incontinence.
Neurosurgery consulted and felt he would benefit from acute neurosurgical intervention for cord decompression.
Felt this may be lymphomatous infiltration rather than solid tumor mets and so requesting biopsy results prior to radiation initiation.
# Cancer: History distant penile cancer though now with blastic disease in spine.
Rare for penile cancer to metastasize.
Given chronicity of spinal lesions, blastic in nature and indolent course there is high suspicion for metastatic prostate Ca.
PSA added on to AM labs and showed an elevated level at 11.4.
# HTN: Continued Atenolol though would consider switching to alternative since BB inferior for HTN management and because of CRF .
# BPH: Chronic, stable, continued terazosin .
Chronic, stalbe, continued pantoprazole, no evidence of bleed during admission and Hct remained stable around baseline .
# Hypothyroidism: Chronic, stable, continued levothyroxine .
# HLD: Chronic, stable, continued simvastatin .
