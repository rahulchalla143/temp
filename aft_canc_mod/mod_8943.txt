Admission Date:  [**2107-11-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-11-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2026-9-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: R sided weakness .
ICU admission: hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC  History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname 109963**] is an 81 yo male with lung cancer ([**2078**]), throat cancer (approx [**2101**]), and new diagnosis of mandible cancer who was found down on his kitchen floor by a neighbor after 24+ hours.
At this point he reported awakening with new R arm weakness.
He denied any preceding weakness or numbness in his extremities.
He does have approx 1 month hx of dysarthria and pain from jaw mass.
Additionally denies fever, chills, cough or respiratory symptoms.
Denies headache or neck stiffness.
ABG revealed:7.40/51/135 on NRB, and CXR showed RLL opacity suspicious for pneumonia.
Stat CT Head showed no evidence of bleed.
Past Medical History: Lung cancer- s/p radiation Neck Cancer- newly diagnosed/awaiting biopsy, pt has severe dysarthria x1month as a result.
Large mandibular mass for which he is followed at [**Hospital 13128**] Institute   Social History: Patient lives alone in [**Location (un) 583**], widowed x3 years, no children, quit smoking in [**2069**]'s, drinks on Saturdays up to 5 glasses of alchohol - denies any withdrawal symptoms.
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: Admission: VS: Temp: 96.2 BP: 126/46 HR: 63 RR: 13 O2sat 86% on RA, 95% on 70% cool mist mask GEN: pleasant, comfortable, mild respiratory distress, loose cough HEENT: L pupil slightly larger than R, both briskly reactive to light, EOMI, anicteric, very large mass both in R oral cavity and on jaw - greenish and crusted.
NECK: supple RESP: fine crackles R greater L, rhoncherous BS CV: bradycardic, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly EXT: no c/c/e, warm, good pulses, weak rt UE SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice NEURO: AAOx3 but confabulates.
Microbiology: Blood Cx [**11-19**]: [**12-30**] lactobacillus Blood CX [**11-22**] and [**11-23**]: no growth .
LE Doppler: Partially occlusive DVT noted in the left mid SFV to the popliteal vein, with eccentric shape, likely chronic.
Non-contrast Head CT: multiple prior lacunar infarctions, age related atrophy with widened ventricles, no hemorrhage or mass effect.
CXR: RLL infiltrate c/w pneumonia versus large mass .
Segmental pulmonary embolism to the right middle lobe.
Smaller subsegmental filling defect in a left lower lobe branch.
Pleural-based mass, the right lung base mass and extensive pleural thickening in the setting of pathologically enlarged mediastinal and left axillary lymph nodes appear consistent with the patient's reported history of mesothelioma.
Centrilobular emphysema and right basilar honeycombing are consistent with advanced chronic interstitial lung disease.
Air-bronchograms present at the medial aspect of the right lung base could be consistent with pneumonia.
MRI/MRA head: IMPRESSION (prelim):Scattered throughout the left cerebral hemisphere, predominantly within the left parietotemporal lobe, but also including the occipital and frontal lobes, there are multiple focal areas of restricted diffusion with accompanying FLAIR hyperintensities likely to represent acute/subacute infarctions, probably secondary to multiple emboli.
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
There is moderate periventricular T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity consistent with chronic microvascular infarction.
Multifocal left cerebellar areas of restricted diffusion with associated edema, most likely representing acute/subacute infarction.
The distribution of these lesions favors infarction over encephalitis.
Slightly heterogeneous clivus which although not overtly consistent with metastasis, can be followed up with bone scan if there is further clinical concern.
3.MRA CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]:  There is no evidence of stenosis, aneurysm, or vascular malformation.
If he decides to continue with PO intake, I would recommend a PO diet of nectar thick liquids and pureed solids with the following aspiration precautions: a) alternate between every bite and sip b) small, single sips of liquid only -no straws and no chugging c) pills crushed with purees .
During his hospital stay, he was treated for PE and pneumonia.
He was followed by neurology for new left hemisphere strokes.
He was also seen by the palliative care team given his deteriorating performace status and poor prognosis.
Transfer to the VA was arranged, but on the day of transfer, the patient became somnolent.
After being made [**Name (NI) 3225**], he received morphine for pain and air hunger.
# Somnolence: On [**11-25**], the patient became increasingly somnolent and was unarousable.
At the time he was not hypoxic and had not received any morphine, or sedating medications.
ABG's noted hypercarbia which is the most likely cause of his somnolence.
The causes of his hypercarbia were felt to be irreversible - advance lung CA-, and he was changed to comfort measures only.
The reason for his fall is likely multifactorial with PNA, gait instability, vasovagal episode?, arrhythmia?, deconditioning and possible dehydration.
He was noted to have a wandering atrial pacemaker on EKG and possible old anterior MI but no AV block or arrhythmia that would explain loss of consciousness.
He was given IVF to resolve dehydration and antibiotics for likely PNA.
An echo to evaluated for structural heart abnormalities or vegetations was attempted but the patient was too agitated to tolerate the study.
He responded well to Zyprexa or Risperdal during episodes of agitation.
# Hypoxia: On admission the patient was hypoxic with SaO2 88%.
On Chest CT , he was found to have large pelural mass (consistent with known Lung CA) and a possible post-obstructive pneumonia.
LE U/S showed left femoral DVT.
CTA also showed advanced interstitial lung disease on CTA - the patient has a known extensive history of asbestos exposure and 100 pack year smoking history.
MRI of the head showed no metastasis making him lower risk of intracranial hemorrhage.
# Stroke: On admission, the patient was found to have right arm weakness, possible right facial droop and possible right horner's syndrome on exam.
Head CT noted multiple non-specific lesions.
An MRI/MRA was performed which showed multifocal left cerebral acute infarction.
Given distribution, it was thought that these lesions probably represent embolic phenomenon although metastatic disease is also possible.
Given his DVT/PE, thromboembolic disease is likely although it is unkown if patient has a PFO.
The patient had no new heart murmur, no physical findings of septic embolic disease  and only 1/4 bottles lactobaccillus (an unlikely endocarditis pathogen) making endocartitis unlikely.
An echo to evaluate for endocarditis was attempted but the patient was too agitiated to tolerate it.
The patient also received a speech and swallow evaluation which showed significant dysphagia and aspiration.
However, given his prognosis, the patient elected to continue with oral intake (thickened fluids and pureed solids) knowing the risks of aspiration and pneumonia.
# GI Bleeding: Several days after the patient was started on heparin for PE, he had a bowel movement with bright red blood on the exterior, no melena.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable with no change in serial HCT's.
His GI bleed was presumed to be due to hemrrhoids.
He was continued on heparin but coumadin was stopped in order be able to stop anticoagulation if GI bleed became more significant.
He had no further episodes of bloody stool.
# Lung cancer/ Head & Neck Cancer: The patient has know extensive disease, confirmed by Chest CT and Head MRI.
Head MRI found multiple areas of infarction but no overt metastasis.
Per his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was originally scheduled to have his jaw mass biopsied at [**Hospital 13128**] 2 weeks from the date of admission.
However, given his poor prognosis and the patient's prior decision not to have his lung CA worked up or treated, the patient decided not to have any biopsies performed.
# PNA: CT notes a possible post-obtructive PNA.
In the setting of fever, leukocytosis and left shift, the patient was presumed to have a PNA and given antibiotics.
In the ED he was given Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl for PNA but this was changed to Unasyn given likelihood of aspiration of gram positive oral anaerobes with his mouth cancer.
He became afebrile and his WBC trended down.
# LFT elevations: Initially, he was found to have mild LFT elevations with AST 98 and ALT 45 of unclear etiology.
# CK elevations: On admission, his CK was elevated (peak 1391), with Troponin 0.02 making AMI unlikely.
Given that he was found down over 24h, his CK was elevated due to mild rhabdomyolysis.
He never had any electrolyte abnormalities or myoglobin in his urine.
