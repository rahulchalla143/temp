Peripheral blood morphological review shows high white counts, blasts with high N:C ratio, irregular nuclear contours, very sparse granules.
Given the absence of HLA-DR [**Last Name (STitle) **] CD34, while the morphology does not support it, the flow profile does not rule out acute promyelocytic leukemia.
Cytogenetics Report [**2200-6-15**] Culture of this specimen yielded no metaphase cells; therefore, chromosome analysis could not be performed  FISH analysis with probes to the PML and RARA loci was interpreted as NORMAL.
Imaging  Echo (pre-chemo) [**2200-6-15**]: IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size and global/regional systolic function.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2200-6-19**] IMPRESSION:  Evidence of ischemia in the right centrum semiovale following the distribution of the superior division of the sylvian MCA.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS [**2200-6-19**] IMPRESSION:  No deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower extremity  TTE (Congenital, focused views) [**2200-6-20**] This focused study demonstrates a patent foramen ovale with small amount of right-to-left interatrial flow at rest.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST [**2200-6-24**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Findings most consistent with typhlitis/neutropenic colitis, given patient's history.
7 x 12 mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule; given substantial size, follow-up CT is recommended within three months to show resolution.
A small nearby nodule can also be reassessed at that time.
Right middle lobe tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] process may represent early infection/inflammation.
Small hypodensities bilateral renal cortices, too small to characterize fully.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST [**2200-7-1**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Persistent cecitis and ascending colitis with persistent and perhaps slightly increased wall thickening and also greater inflammatory fat stranding.
The appearance suggests neutropenic colitis given the patient's history.
Left lower lobe pulmonary nodule, increased in the short one-week interval since the prior study, worrisome for an ongoing infectious etiology.

Given lab findings, with elevated WBC count to 257K with 98% blasts, found to have likely acute myelomonocytic leukemia, course of 7+3 chemotherapy complicated by stroke, typhlitis, neutropenic fever, and likely fungal lung infection.
# Acute leukemia: Healthy 75F with 2-3 weeks of fatigue and recent possible dental abscess s/p extraction [**6-5**] who presented with elevated WBC >200K and anemia/thrombocytopenia discovered at her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**6-13**].
In the [**Last Name (LF) 153**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] IJ central line catheter was placed for pheresis given her WBC of 257 and risk for leukostasis.
She underwent 7+3 cytarabine & idarubicin, course was complicated by ischemic CVA on [**6-18**] found to have PFO & no obvious source of thrombus, neutropenic colitis ([**2198-6-23**]), likely fungal lung infection and neutropenic fever as discussed below.
After coming out of her nadir, patient had leukocytosis to 20-30k, peripheral smear and flow showed mature monocytes, possibly consistent with myelodysplasia or robust recovery, less likely recurrence of leukemia or infection.
Bone marrow biopsy was not done for evidence of remission as patient does not wish to have further chemotherapy, regardless of potential result.
-Patient will continue to follow with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] in clinic  #Sepsis/Febrile neutropenia:  Pt had low grade fevers on [**6-30**], and fever to 101.7 @430 [**7-1**], afebrile at the time of transfer [**7-2**].
Sinus CT found possible involvement of the right maxillary sinus.
Before being transferred to the ICU for the second time during this admission, she also developed hypotension with SBP in 80s after receving ambisome.
At time, the hypotension was consider to be mult-factorial including side-effect of ambisome as well as underlying infection.
A CT chest/abd ([**7-1**]) found enlarging nodule in LLL, and sinus CT found possible involvement of the right maxillary sinus with oral-antral fistula.
- Per oral maxillofacial surgery there is no evidence of a current dental abcess or dental infection - All antibiotics except voriconazole were stopped and patient was stable for two days prior to discharge.
# Syncope:  Syncopal episode [**2200-6-23**] likely secondary to vasovagal or orthostatic hypotension.Pt had difficult ambulating and required more assistance than normal.
# Ischemic CVA - pt w/ new isolated L-sided mouth droop since [**6-18**], neurology was consulted, MRI showed subtle area of ischemia in centrum stemi ovale, extending into right insula (vascular territory of R MCA), echo w/ bubble showed PFO, doppler of bilateral LEs negative.
-Blood pressure control -ASA 162mg daily started prior to discharge  #Rash: Patient had new erythematous non-pruritic maculopapular, blanching rash on the back from the nape of neck to the T8-T9 dermatome.
Concern was for leukemia cutis or fungal or drug rash.
Dermatology was consulted and believed the rash was dependent erythema with early miliaria from recent fevers, biopsy showed likely drug hypersensitivity reaction.
# Typhlitis/Neutropenic colitis: Pt found to have significant bowel wall thickening and edema from cecum to hepatic flexture consistent with typhlitis/ neutropenic colitis on [**2200-6-24**].
Pt did not have abdominal pain but has reported some loose stools.
# Pulmonary nodule: [**Month (only) 116**] represent infection vs inflammation.
- Pt on aztrenonam, flagyl, vanco, ambisome - concern since nodule size has increased in size over 1 week period - pt will need follow up CT in 3 months to f/u on nodule - pt will follow in outpatient [**Hospital **] clinic, to determine length of voriconazole treatment  Transitional Issues: - pt will need follow up CT in 3 months to f/u on nodule - goals of care: patient does not want more chemotherapy if she has a recurrence  Medications on Admission: CALCIUM CARBONATE-VITAMIN D3 [CALCIUM 600 + D(3)] -  (OTC) - COD LIVER OIL -  (OTC) - Dosage uncertain MULTIVITAMIN -  (OTC) -  by mouth once a day  Discharge Medications: 1.

You came to the hospital because you were tired, not feeling well and you were found to have a high white blood cell count by your primary care physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] were found to have acute myelogenous leukemia so you underwent induction chemotherapy with (7+3) [**Doctor First Name **] + cytarabine.
You also experienced a stroke which resulted in a left facial droop and left arm weakness.
In addition you also developed neutropenic colitis which means that the wall of your large intestines was inflammed which is a complication of receiving chemotherpy.
We put you on appropriate antibiotics to prevent an infection, rested your bowels, and provide you nutrition via an IV line.
In addition you also developed a rash which was a side effect of the antibioitics you were taking.
The following changes were made to your medications: START voriconazole for your fungal infection START acyclovir to prevent viral infections START two baby aspirin a day for your stroke START metoprolol for your high blood pressure  Please keep your appointments as scheduled below.
