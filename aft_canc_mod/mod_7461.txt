T10 mass, excision (D):       Metastatic carcinoma (see note).
Note: The tumor consists of well-formed thyroid follicles lined by oxyphilic cells with prominent nucleoli.
A stain for thyroglobulin shows high background staining and is non-contributory.
The histomorphologic and immunophenotypic findings are consistent with metastatic follicular carcinoma, oxyphilic (Hurthle cell) type.
It consists of a piece of red hemorrhagic and cauterized soft tissue with associated tendon and bone that measures 8 x 6 x 1 cm.
The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal hemorrhagic cut surfaces without any mass lesions and represented in cassette D.   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] Spine Surgery Service and taken to the Operating Room for the above procedure without complication and was taken to the SICU intubated for intraoperative hypotension.
TEDs / pnemoboots were used for postoperative DVT prophylaxis.
The patient's pain was controlled with IV pain medications followed by oral analgesics once tolerating POs.
He continued to improve on a daily basis and was limited by proprioceptive deficits in his feet.
His intraoperative pathology report was consistent with metastatic carcinoma, likely thyroid.
On the day of discharge the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs, comfortable on oral pain control and tolerating a regular diet.
