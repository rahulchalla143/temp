Admission Date:  [**2119-7-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-7-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2050-6-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Iodine; Iodine Containing / Levaquin  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**] Chief Complaint: Left sided clumsiness and weakness.
History of Present Illness: Time Code Stroke called: 12:43pm (24h clock) Time Neurology at bedside for evaluation: 12:49 pm (24h clock) Time (and date) the patient was last known well: 12:30 pm NIH Stroke Scale Score: 8 t-[**MD Number(3) 6360**]:  NO, chronic thrombocytopenia given lymphoma with platelets of 60 today  Reason for Consult: Called by Emergency Department to evaluate CODE STROKE  Please see stroke fellow note for full details.
HPI: In brief, this is a 69 year old female with recurrent B cell lymphoma (on [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy since [**2119-5-22**]), atrial fibrillation (on rate control), history of c diff, hx of DVT, HTN who presented to the ED with sudden onset of confusion associated with left facial droop and left arm weakness.
In the ED, attending noted left face and arm weakness and called a code stroke within 15 minutes of symptom onset.
Initially taken to head CT that did not show early evidence of stroke.
She had urgent MRI/MRA head and neck because of a contrast allergy.
+ right atrial thrombus on echo.
Follow up PET scan in [**12/2117**] showed worsening adenopathy with biopsy consistent with her known lymphoma.
Received high-dose Cytoxan for stem cell mobilization and collections on [**2118-4-22**] followed by an autologous stem cell transplant on the BEAM regimen starting on [**2118-5-19**].
Her chemotherapy and posttransplant course were complicated byproctitis and rectal pain which resolved with recovery of her counts.
She also was noted for lymphocytosis of unclear etiology felt possibly related to an autoimmune process.
She also developed a drop in her DLCO with concern for pneumonitis.
At the end of [**2118-7-19**], she was noted for hemolysis with a slight drop in her hematocrit and hemoglobin.
This was fully evaluated and felt related to increasing lipids with increasing triglycerides seen in the setting of a higher glucose with her steroid use.
Restaging CT scan on [**2118-11-1**] showed a new single 21.7 mm focus of prevascular adenopathy.
She underwent CT guided LN biopsy on [**2118-11-23**] which unfortunately showed recurrence of her B-cell lymphoma with aggressive features.
There was also a small component of a possible T cell lymphoma noted on one of the cores.
Follow up PET/CT scan on [**2118-12-7**] showed further progression of her disease with new markedly FDG avid anterior mediastinal nodal mass compared to previous PET-CT. New mediastinal (including anterior, precarinal and subcarinal), right hilar, retrocrural, retroperitoneal and right iliac FDG avid lymphadenopathy.
Following 2 cycles of therapy, repeat PET scan on [**2119-1-30**] showed a 44.6% decrease in lymph nodes which is considered stable disease.
Admitted on [**2119-4-16**] for fever/neutropenia with cough and probable pneumonia.
Follow up CT scan showed a mixed response, with interval decrease of mediastinal lymphadenopathy but increased of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
It was not clear whether this was related to her recent infections or progression of lymphoma particularly as her LDH had increased again.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 103705**] underwent a repeat CT torso on [**2119-5-17**], which demonstrated further progression of her disease, with enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
Her counts remained low and she underwent bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2119-5-18**] which showed no evidence for lymphoma.
Was on Coumadin which has been on hold with recent treatment.
Digoxin discontinued since early [**1-/2119**] due to increased dig level and bradycardia.
History of DVT in left leg [**8-/2116**], treated with Lovenox 5.
Hypertension 6.
Asthma 8.
MVA, [**7-/2117**] with bilateral C2 vertebral foramen fracture/C2 body fracture, manubrium fracture, right rib fractures of ribs six through eight, left distal radial/ulnar styloid fracture.
Her husband continues to be a tremendous support.
Family History: Mother - no cancer.
Father - cerebellar hemorrhage; leg amputation due to "poor circulation."
Physical Exam: Vital sign: BP: 134/76 RR: 16 HR: 72 100% on 2 Liters  GENERAL: Pleasant, fatigued appearing HEENT: Sclera anicteric, oropharynx dry without lesions or thrush.
JVP wnl LN: No cervical, SC LAD LUNGS: decreased BS at bases b/l HEART: Irregularly irregular rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops ABDOMEN: Soft, nondistended, normal bowel sounds, diffuse TTP throughout.
EXTREMITIES: no edema  Neuro exam:  Mental status: Awake and alert, oriented to time, place and person.
no aphasia, no dysarthria.
visugal field cut with right hemianopsia.
no gaze prference initially but later she has slight gaze preference to right side with visual neglect as well.
V, VII: facial sensation normal, mild facial drooping to left side.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Face symmetric, no tongue deviation.
Initial CT head in ED [**7-10**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process; please note MRI is more sensitive for the detection of acute stroke.
Acute infarct in the right thalamus.
Irregularity within the anterior circulation and right distal vertebral artery which may be related to artifact or atherosclerotic disease.
Lack of flow in the right posterior cerebral artery just beyond its origin, which may represent occlusion or high-grade stenosis.
New 1.7-cm right thalamic hematoma within the pulvinar in the location of recent ischemic infarct is consistent with hemorrhagic conversion.
Mild peripheral zone of edema exerts no significant mass effect.
There is no notable midline shift or evidence of transtentorial or tonsillar herniation.
New right occipital hypoattenuation extending to cortical surface and involving the visual cortex is concordant with symptoms and concerning for extension of ischemic infarction.
Subsequent HCHCT [**7-13**]: FINDINGS: There is an evolving appearance of right PCA infarction and subsequent edema in the right occipital lobe.
There is stable appearance of right thalamic hemorrhage.
The edema is exerting mass effect on adjacent structures with no appreciable shift of normally midline structures.
There are mild vascular calcifications in the cavernous carotid arteries.
Unchanged appearance of left frontal osteoma and hyperostosis frontalis.
Stable appearance of right thalamic hemorrhage.
She also demonstrated left hemi-neglect.
On admission and that evening, some left arm movement and left grasp were notable with extinction on left face.
On the morning of [**7-11**] anisocoria was more evident (for unclear reasons left pupil was larger) and sensory loss was denser with loss of light touch and no response to painful stimulation (either reflexive or cortical).
Repeat NCHCT revealed some hemorrhagic conversion consistent with leakage rather than frank hemorrhage given low Houndsfield units.
She gradually improved with examination on the morning of [**7-12**] revealing increased, although ataxic movement of the left arm and return of diconnected pain sensibility (aversive component retained without accurate localization).
Given hemorrhage and worsened AF with reduction of beta-blocker at admission, home medications were restarted at typical doses with improvement of AF.
She had one episode of BRBPR that was attributed to hemorrhoids in the setting of thrombocytopenia without significant Hct drop.
Her other home meds were continued and she remained rate controlled with irregular rhythm throughout.
