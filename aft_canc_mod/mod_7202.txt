Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bronch/med/ left thoracotomy bullectomy, talc pleuradesis [**2195-8-18**] trach/peg [**2195-8-31**]   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 68 year-old male with a history of severe COPD, emphysema and bullous disease, who was recently diagnosed with a left hilar mass, two biopsies of which were negative.
The patient also has a past medical history of multiple skin cancers as well as history of tobacco use, parotid resection times 2 for adenocystic carcinoma  that required a right lower lobe wedge that showed metastatic adenocystic carcinoma in the lower lobe.
The patient was admitted electively to undergo a bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy and, in case it was negative, he would undergo a thoracotomy with possible resection of his left hilar mass.
His preoperative PFT's were borderline and it was obvious that he would not tolerate a left pneumonectomy but he would do well with a left upper lobectomy.

He did require some neoepinephrine for hypotension but was taken off it POD2.
On POD2, patient found to have shortness of breath, increased work of breathing, desaturation down to 80% on face mask.
