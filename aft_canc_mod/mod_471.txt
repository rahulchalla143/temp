Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with fever and productive cough.
The cough started 3 weeks ago and has been productive of green sputum, and associated with mild shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting (attributed to Gleevec), and fatigue.
She saw her oncologist on [**2114-11-6**] for a followup, was afebrile with O2 sat 91,RA, and was noted to have a WBC of 11.2.
Today, she noted difficulty breathing and fevers/chills/night sweats, as well as cough, with symptoms worse the past two days.
She also reports anorexia and [**7-1**]# wt loss.
On exam, she was dry with diminished breath sounds and right sided crackles, and tachycardia.
A CT of the chest was ordered looking for possible PCP and showed evidence of infection with multifocal airspace opacities.
While in the ED, her respiratory status worsened, becoming more tachypneic and hypoxic requiring intubation.
Fluid non-diagnostic but as high suspicion for CSF disease started on twice weekly methotrexate ---[**2113-12-28**]: CSF sample from confirmed CNS involvement of ALL ---[**2115-1-1**] CSF sample from  was negative for ALL so IT MTX discontinued - [**2114-1-17**]: Part B hyperCVAD of cycle 1 was started (IT chemo was limited to D6 ara-C on [**2114-1-22**] to minimize neurotoxicity) - [**2114-2-2**]: Cycle 2 (Part A) of hyperCVAD started - [**2114-3-5**]: Cycle 2 (Part B) hyperCVAD chemotherapy started - [**2114-4-5**]: IT MTX administered  OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY ============================ - Latent tuberculosis: PPD with 12mm of induration in [**2111**] at [**Hospital1 2177**] after which received [**1-26**] mos of INH discontinued due to transaminitis, she has been on moxifloxacin suppression since starting chemotherapy -Hypertension -Hyperlipidemia -Diabetes Mellitus (not on medications) -Vitamin D deficiency - Hepatitis B Ab positive (core +), maintained on lamuvidine   Social History: She is Mandarin-speaking only and immigrated from [**Country 651**] in [**2100**].

LUNGS: R lung fields with diffuse crackles.
L side clear.
HEART: RRR no M/R/G ABDOMEN: + BS.
Soft, nontender, nondistended with no hepatosplenomegaly.

Pertinent Results: Admission Labs:  [**2114-11-9**] 01:37PM   LACTATE-1.5 [**2114-11-9**] 09:15AM   GLUCOSE-156* UREA N-17 CREAT-0.9 SODIUM-137 POTASSIUM-3.8 CHLORIDE-102 TOTAL CO2-22 ANION GAP-17 [**2114-11-9**] 09:15AM   ALT(SGPT)-24 AST(SGOT)-27 LD(LDH)-349* ALK PHOS-189* TOT BILI-0.8 [**2114-11-9**] 09:15AM   WBC-13.5* RBC-2.96* HGB-10.0* HCT-29.7* MCV-101* MCH-33.8* MCHC-33.6 RDW-13.9 [**2114-11-9**] 09:15AM   NEUTS-68.1 LYMPHS-17.8* MONOS-13.3* EOS-0.5 BASOS-0.3  Discharge Labs:  Radiology: CT Chest w/o contrast: IMPRESSION: New-onset airspace opacification with air bronchograms of the right upper lobes, lower lobes and middle portion of the right middle lobe with patchy diffusely distributed opacification in the left lung with an associated right pleural effusion, suggests the possibility of an infectious process, such as multifocal bacterial pneumonia.
However, considering the patient's clinical history of recent bone marrow transplantation, an atypical pneumonia must be included in the differential diagnosis (fungal, mycobacterial, viral organisms).
Pulmonary edema and pulmonary hemorrhage are less likely, as the patient's history does not have corroborating symptoms for the same.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
# Respiratory failure: Consistent with ARDS in setting on severe PNA.
BAL was negative for PCP; there was some concern that inhaled pentamidine could make a BAL appear falsely negative and diagnosis could require a tissue biopsy, but the beta-glucan was also negative, which was reassuring for rule out of PCP.
Since her LFTs were beginning to rise, bactrim was discontinued, as she has a history of elevated LFTs in the setting of this medication.
Cardiac causes of respiratory failure were considered, but a TTE showed hyperdynamic function with LVEF> 55%, mild pulm htn, trivial pericardial effusion, and no valvular disease, so this was not likely to cause a compromise in respiratory function.
Eventually, she was able to tolerate AC settings with increased sedation, and only brief trials on pressure support with less sedation.
She would often desaturate with positional changes, likely also had some mucus plugging.
On [**11-29**], the patient became hypotensive with SBP in 70s.
The patient was repositioned patient on left side and noticed decreased breath sounds on left in new position.
Got stat CXR which showed large left pneumothorax.
On [**12-3**], the patient developed massive upper GI bleed.
EGD was performed at bedside which revealed massive amounts of clotted blood in the fundus of the stomach, but no clear eveidence of active bleed.
Given clinical deterioration, extensive discussion was held with the patient's husband and family about goals of care and a decision was made about no further escalation in care, including no blood products or lab draws.
# Septic shock: The patient was hypotensive requiring levophed and vasopressin initially, likely due to septic shock secondary to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest.
There was a wide differential given her immunosuppression which included usual pathogens (Strep, etc), viral (flu, CMV), PCP (esp with elev LDH), atypicals.
She was also empirically started on oseltamivir for flu coverage which was discontinued on the fifth day of treatment due to a negative flu culture.
The urine legionella antigen was negative, and the patient did not grow any bacteria from her urine or blood cultures.
Her urine output at times was low likely due to hypotension and a component of ATN.
On [**11-24**], an inverse correlation between fever curves and Bactrim use was found and Bactrim was re-started again.
#Non-gap acidosis: Related to normal saline and a component of renal failure.
During her lasix drip administration, the patient developed a metabolic contraction alkalosis.
# ALL: On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood transplantation.
She was started on stress dose steroids of hydrocortisone 100mg IV Q8hours; when the stress dose steroids were tapered down slowly, the patient seemed to make less progress with her respiratory status, so her steroid dose was increased back.
# Anemia: The patient intermittently needed blood transfusions due to low Hematocrits.
Her anemia is likely due to her CA, anemia of chronic inflammation and the daily blood draws that were needed during her ICU course.
# Hep B: The patient was continued on lamivudine.
