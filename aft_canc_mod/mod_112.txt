The patient was in her usual state of health until this morning when she began to feel epigastric abdominal pain, associated with nausea and vomiting.
Does not report hematemesis or diarrhea.
Patient had a similar episode one month ago and one in [**2130**].
She denies history of EtOH use and had CCY in [**2132**] with no subsequent history of gallstones.
Past Medical History: Past medical hx: s/p ccy ovarian clot- requiring coumadin hypertrigylceridemia pancreatitis metastatic breast cancer  onc hx: Primary Onc: Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Metastatic Breast ca- in past, undewent chemo w/ adriamycin/cytoxan, then taxol.
Her course has been complicated by compression fractures in T1-T6 and T9.
She underwent radiation treatment for T1 and developed more pain and T6 then was found to have a compression fracture with cord compression.
The decision had initially been made to continue her chemotherapy through her radiation treatment as a radiation sensitizer; however, the patient had episodes of severe nausea and vomiting and diarrhea resulting in additional  hospitalizations.
CT on [**10-18**] showed progression in size of liver mets and development of new right sided pulmonary nodules.
PET [**10-21**] showed widespread metastatic bone lesions which were stable in intensity and number.
Family History: Aunt with breast cancer on father's side.

Imaging: CXR ([**2138-1-24**]): Lungs are clear without infiltrate, effusion, or pneumothorax.
Abdominal CT ([**2138-1-25**]): Marked peripancreatic inflammatory change, with free fluid in the retroperitoneum, and extending into the pelvis.
Findings compatible with known history of pancreatitis.
No loculated fluid collection, pancreatic necrosis, or vascular complications identified.
MRCP ([**2138-1-27**]): Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, extensive peripancreatic inflammatory change without evidence of pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst formation.
Normal appearance of the biliary tree and pancreatic duct, stable appearance of multiple hepatic metastases, diffuse fatty infiltration of liver.
[**2137-1-29**] Rib Film ([**2138-1-29**]): No definite lytic or sclerotic rib or shoulder metastases identified.
Bone scan is recommended for further evaluation due to its greater sensitivity for detection for metastases.
Small left pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis.
Bone scan: ([**2138-1-31**]) Numerous metastatic bone lesions as described above which are stable compared to the most recent prior study.
[**2138-2-3**] Blood culture: ANAEROBIC BOTTLE (Preliminary):      GRAM POSITIVE RODS.
Brief Hospital Course: 47 female with metastatic breast cancer and two prior episodes of pancreatitis (98 and [**11-30**]) thought to be to be secondary to hypertriglyceridemia admitted for acute pancreatitis most likely secondary to hypertriglyceridemia v. chemotherapy.
1) Pancreatitis: In the ED ([**2139-1-25**]) the patient reported diffuse abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.
Abdominal CT showed marked peripancreatic inflammatory change, with free fluid in the retroperitoneum, and extending into the pelvis.
No loculated fluid collection, pancreatic necrosis, or vascular complications were identified.
The radiological findings, lab values and patient's presentation was compatible with pancreatitis, and she was subsequently admitted to medicine for acute pancreatitis believed secondary to hypertriglyceridemia v. chemotherapy.
The evening after admission, the patient had MS changes, became tachycardic to 150's, required increased IVF and had rectal temp to 103.8.
In the MICU, she reported LUQ pain which was initally attributed to pancreatitis (See discussion below).
MRCP showed extensive peripancreatic inflammatory change without evidence of pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst formation.
The pancreatic duct and biliary tree appeared normal.
Patient's WBC, amylase and lipase continued to trend downwards, but she continued to have intermittant fevers (see discussion below).
At the time of discharge, the patient was afebrile and WBC, amylase and lipase were wnl and she was on only PO pain meds.
2) LUQ/left lower rib pain: Thiswas most likely secondary to pleural irritation due to pancreatitis.
Rib films and bone scan swere negative for fractures or rib mestases that could be contributing to her pain, CTA was negative for PE, and, although CT scan showed small bilateral pleural effusion, their low volume prevented thoracentesis.
At time of discharge, her pain was adequately controlled.
4)Fever: The patient was febrile for the first week and a half of her hospital stay, which was most likely secondary to resolving pancreatitis, with possible contributor of coagulase negative staph bacteremia (see above).
She underwent a thorough infectious disease work-up which, aside from the bacteremia noted above, was negative.
At time of discharge, the patient has been afebrile for >72 hours.
There were no schistocytes on smear and no clinical evidence of bleeding.
Prior iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
6) Hypertriglyceridemia: The patient has a longstanding history of hypertriglyceridemia and two prior bouts of pancreatitis thought to be secondary to hypertriglyceridemia.
7) Metastatic breast cancer: Prior to admission, patient was a chemotherapeutic regimen of neulasta and navelbine (two weeks on/ one weeks off).
