No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Massive mediastinal and left hilar tumor with obvious mass effect and compression or infiltration of the left and the right main pulmonary artery, the pulmonary veins, the esophagus, and the left main bronchus.
Multiple bilateral mainly subpleural nodular opacities, the biggest one of which is located in the left upper lobe and this cavitated, containing a soft tissue structure.
Bilateral paramediastinal areas of subtle fibrosis could be the sequela of mediastinal radiation.
Small left pleural effusion.
7-mm liver hypodensity, status post rib fractures, sclerotic rib and T-spine lesion, potentially representing metastasis.
Left atrial abnormality.
Right ventricular conduction delay.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2176-1-30**] the anterolateral ST-T wave abnormalities persist without diagnostic interim change.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 y/o F s/p R frontal mass resection on [**2176-1-12**] for metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma presents with UTI and AMS.
# Altered Mental Status: Mrs [**Known lastname 69844**] had a Head CT that showed stable changes s/p resection.
She had no cough or infiltrate on CXR to suggest pneumonia.
Resperiadone was stopped due to concern for EKG changes (namely QT prolongation).
# UTI: Enterococcus in urine sensitive to Ampicillin, Nitrofurantoin, Vancomycin.
We reconfirmed the infection with UA positive and UCx + for Enterococcus.
# Tachycardia: Tachycardia is persistent.
The source of her tachycardia may be due to dehydration, infection, underlying malignancy, steroid side effects.
This is like the reason for her underlying tachycardia.
Barium swallow was done to eval for extrinsic compression of the chest mass on the esophagus.
# s/p right frontal mass resection: CT head changes consistent with post-op peroid, no acute changes.
Neurosurgery evaluated in ED and felt no acute neurosurg issues.
# Malignancy: Patient with history of stage IV thoracic rhabdomyosarcoma currently on chemotherapy.
Path from right frontal lesion confirms metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma.
Also history of L breast cancer - DCIS s/p lumpectomy.
She therefore had a speech and swallow evaluation in coordination with a study of her esophagus.
Contrast was able to get through her esophagus, although it was noted to have some external compression from her tumor.
Per speech and swallow recommendations, she should be on a PO diet of ground solids and thin liquids; no mixed consistencies including solid cereal in milk or whole pills with water.
Encourage small bites and sips and maintain aspiration precautions.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Urosepsis Altered Mental Status Tachycardia s/p right frontal mass resection Malignancy   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Confused - always Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair   Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital with altered mental status and findings of urinary tract infection.
We treated your infection and provided you with fluid support.
We did find on imaging studies that you have an extensive tumor in your lung, which compress the great vessels from the heart to the lungs and obstructed the left main wind pipe.
