There has been some decrease in opacification at the right base, though residual combination of infiltrate of atelectasis, effusion, and possible pneumonia persists.
There is little change in the increased opacification described previously at the left base.
Pathology Examination SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: Esophagus and proximal stomach, left gastric lymph nodes.
Barrett's esophagus with polypoid high grade dysplasia.
No invasive carcinoma identified.
Proximal margin with squamous mucosa.
No glandular mucosa present.
One lymph node with no tumor seen.
Left gastric lymph nodes: Seven nodes with no tumor seen.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  CTA OF THE CHEST: There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
Heart size is normal and there is a tiny to small pericardial effusion, measuring simple fluid density.
Scattered coronary calcifications are noted within the LAD and RCA.
There are large bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with associated atelectasis at the lung bases.
The lungs demonstrate moderate paraseptal emphysema, worst at the lung apices.
No suspicious nodules or masses are identified.
Small mediastinal lymph nodes are noted, which do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
This exam is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic assessment.
An incompletely characterized cystic lesion is seen off the upper pole of the right kidney - correlation with recent PET CT suggests that this is a large simple cyst.
Multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine, with prominent anterior osteophytosis.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
While in the SICU he was hypertensive and a question of a new right bundle branch block was seen on ECG.
Cardiology was consulted and he ruled out for an myocardial infarction.
His pain was managed with an epidural by the acute pain service.
The neck drain was to bulb with moderate serosanguinous drainage.
The chest-tube was placed to water seal with no leak.
On POD #3 the chest-tube and epidural were removed and his pain was managed with a PCA.
The foley was removed and he voided without difficulty.
On POD day #7 he was administer PO grape juice which revealed no anastomotic leak.
He had mild erythema along the staple line of his abdominal wound.
