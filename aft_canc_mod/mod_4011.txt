Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an 89 year old female with h/o CVA with residual cognitive deficits, hypothyroidsim, diastolic heart failure, HTN, hypothyroidism who presents with atrial flutter and hypotension.
Hypotension was not secondary to a pericardial effusion, given a bedside ECHO which did not show this.
She did not appear hypovolemic on labsgive mild enlagment of sillhoute on x-ray, mildly low voltages, and recent instrumentation.
She responded well to 75 mg metoprolol TID, and was discharged on 150 mg XL metoprolol  # Atrial Flutter: Patient appears to have a 3:1-4:1 atrial flutter.
Etiologies of atrial fibrilation/flutter could include hyper or hypovolemic states, MI, infection, electrolyte abnormalities, or thyroid dysfunction.
Patient appears euvolemic as described above.
She ruled out for an MI, and did not have lyte abnormalities.
# Hypothyroid: - Continue home synthroid.
# [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]: - home hydroxyurea.
# Presumed Emphysemia: No note of this in her recent history, but given large lung volumes and smoking history would favor this as the etiology for her medication Fluticasone-Salmeterol - Continue Fluticasone-Salmeterol  # Insomnia: - continue mirtazapine QHS   Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.

You were admitted to our Unit because you were noted to have a low blood pressure as well as a fast heart rate at the [**Hospital **], as well as in our emergency department.
We looked for several reasons why this might be; we did not think that you were dehydrated, we did not find any evidence of infection in your blood, urine or chest x-ray, we do not think that you had a heart attack, and we do not think that you have any fluid around your heart.
