EKG at that time upon presentation was significant for T wave inversion in V1-V6 and RSR prime in V1.
The patient was also noted to have elevated alkaline phosphatase at 153 and an elevated AST at 83.
The patient was placed on respiratory precautions and was started on Ceftazidime for neutropenia and fevers.
The patient also complained of back pain and a bone scan was obtained where the results were negative.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was also performed which revealed normal left ventricular function and no valvular abnormalities.
At [**Hospital3 17310**], the patient's course was subsequently complicated by acute renal failure after the institution of HAART therapy and also anti-tuberculous medication.
The patient was also noted to have acute renal failure and hemolytic anemia with a positive Coombs test.
The patient was also noted to have elevated transaminases.
The patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further workup and evaluation for possible hemolytic anemia syndrome/thrombocytopenia purpura and requiring possible plasmapheresis.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, the patient was a cachectic male, tachypneic, in mild respiratory distress.
Positive thrush and positive jaundice were noted underneath the tongue.
Cardiac examination revealed tachycardia with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdominal examination revealed positive hepatosplenomegaly, mild distention of the abdomen.
Extremity examination revealed no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.
Pulse examination revealed 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses.
No motor weakness was noted.
There was no lung or pleural disease.
Chest x-ray on [**2102-5-19**] revealed minimal cardiomegaly.
EKG revealed sinus tachycardia [**Company 33332**] wave inversions in V1-V5.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 36-year-old male with newly diagnosed HIV with a CD4 count of 15 and viral lode of 50,000 who presented from an outside hospital for further workup for his acute renal failure, hemolytic disease, thrombocytopenia, and transaminitis.
Neurologic:  During the hospital course, the patient had an episode of mental status changes.
Given the fact that the patient was thrombocytopenic, a head CT was obtained to rule out intracranial bleed.
No intracranial bleed was noted.
A lumbar puncture was performed during the hospital course which was negative and did not reveal any evidence of infection.
Cardiac:  Upon transfer to [**Hospital6 2018**], the patient was noted to be tachycardiac and he remained persistently tachycardiac and was noted on multiple EKGs to have sinus tachycardia.
By CK enzymes, the patient had elevated CKs up to the 1000s, however, did not rule in by CKMB indexes which were negative.
During the hospital course, however, the patient remained in persistent tachycardia and chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly.
A cardiac echocardiogram was performed which subsequently revealed a small pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology on cardiac echocardiogram.
The patient had collapse of his right ventricle, partial collapse of his right atrium, and regurgitant inflow from his mitral and tricuspid valves consistent with tamponade physiology.
At the time of this dictation, the patient remained hemodynamically stable with a pulsus paradoxus of approximately 10 mmHg and EKGs did not reveal electrical alternans and no clinical evidence of tamponade.
The Cardiology Service was aware of the patient and if the patient becomes relatively more hemodynamically unstable or shows clinical evidence of tamponade physiology, the Cardiology Service should be reconsulted for pericardial drainage placement.
Pulmonary:  Upon presentation to [**Hospital3 17310**], the patient had no pulmonary respiratory problems.
[**Name (NI) **] was originally started on tuberculosis medications at [**Hospital3 17310**] which contributed to his transaminitis and also the acute renal failure.
During the hospital course, the patient was intubated for several days in order to obtain multiple studies as the patient had mild respiratory distress.
A CT scan revealed lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum.
Upon transfer to [**Hospital6 1760**], given the fact that the patient was in acute renal failure and had transaminitis, all his highly active antiretroviral therapy medications were discontinued.
The pathology of the yeast was consistent with Histoplasmosis duboisii an African variant.
Forty-eight hours after initiation of Ambazone therapy, the patient subsequently defervesced and remained afebrile during the hospital course.
Upon review by pathology, it was consistent with Histoplasmosis duboisii.
At this time, the patient's infectious disease source was thought to be disseminated histoplasmosis given the positive lymph node biopsy and culture and also the positive bone marrow culture.
In regards to the patient's HIV therapy, the patient will not be started on HAART therapy until the patient's anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia are relatively resolved.
However after institution of the HAART therapy and also anti-tuberculosis therapy, the patient subsequently became further pancytopenic and developed severe anemia.
A Coombs test performed at [**Hospital3 17310**] was positive and the patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for possible workup for hemolytic uremia syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
Upon extensive evaluation of the patient's blood smear/slides, there was no evidence of schistocytes.
There was no evidence of hemolytic uremia syndrome.
During the hospital course, the patient had an episode of mild disseminated intravascular coagulopathy which required transfusion of fresh frozen plasma, platelet support, and blood support.
During the hospital course, the patient was also noted to have splenic infarction of unclear etiology.
Hemoglobin electrophoresis was obtained which revealed that the patient had a hemoglobin S trait.
Upon lymph node biopsy, the pathology results revealed that the patient had evidence of Kaposi's sarcoma in his lymph nodes.
The patient's liver function tests were consistent with disseminated histoplasmosis.
Hepatitis serologies were sent which revealed that the patient was exposed to hepatitis B in the past but there was no active hepatitis B infection.
He was also exposed to hepatitis A in the past with no active hepatitis A infection.
Iron studies were obtained which did not reveal that the patient had any evidence of Wilson's disease.
MRI of the abdomen to rule out histoplasmosis abscess in the spleen or liver revealed that the patient had infarcts in the spleen and subsequent hemoglobin electrophoresis revealed that the patient had hemoglobin S trait.
During the hospital course, the patient also had multiple episodes of loose bowel movements.
However during the hospital course at [**Hospital3 17310**], the patient went into acute renal failure with subsequent rise in his creatinine to 5.0 and upon transfer to [**Hospital6 2018**], the patient's creatinine remained at 5 and subsequently peaked at 5.5.
The patient's acute renal failure was thought secondary to acute tubular necrosis from dehydration and medication insult state.
Abdominal CT revealed the patient had diffusely enlarged kidneys bilaterally which were consistent with HIV nephropathy versus disseminated histoplasmosis to the kidney.
The patient probably has chronic renal insufficiency given his HIV status and also his disseminated histoplasmosis.
Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  Upon transfer to [**Hospital6 1760**], the patient was noted to be hyponatremic thought secondary to the patient's volume state.
The patient was subsequently corrected in regards to his sodium status and during the hospital course, the patient became hypernatremic thought secondary to the patient's hypovolemic state from his fevers and also his excessive water losses.
The patient also had poor nutritional status.
and the patient had decreased appetite.
The patient had a PICC line placed and total parenteral nutrition was initiated for nutritional support.
Lines and access:  The patient upon admission to [**Hospital6 1760**] had a right internal jugular triple lumen central line placed which remained in for approximately 10 days.
