Bilobed fusiform abdominal aortic aneurysm with overall dimensions measuring up to 4.8 x 5.2 cm.
No definite signs of rupture.
Mildly dilated small bowel with segments which appear hyperenhancing and  slightly thickened which raises concern for an inflammatory or an infectious  etiology.
Soft tissue nodularity involving the pelvic floor/perineum which could reflect old inflammatory changes though clinical correlation is advised.
Bilateral renal scarring and renal hypodensities, the largest of which appear to represent simple cysts.
Complex ventral hernia, containing non-obstructed small and large bowel.
Extremely demineralized bony pelvis with evidence of old insufficiency fractures.
[**2132-4-8**] ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
Mild to moderate ([**11-25**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse.
An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No evidence of acute fractures or dislocations.
MRI is the recommended study of choice if clinical suspicion for occult fracture is high.
Unusual mottled appearance of bilateral iliac bones, of nonspecific etiology.
Stable abdominal aortic aneurysm without signs of acute rupture.
No retroperitoneal hematoma.
Fluid-filled distended loops of small bowel, without discrete transition point, findings suggestive of ileus.
Cystic lesions within the kidneys, the largest in the left upper pole of indeterminate attenuation.
Stable ventral hernia without evidence of acute obstruction.
New small bilateral pleural effusions.
[**2132-4-16**] KUB: Increased gaseous distension of several bowel loops.
When compared with recent CT, this most likely represents continued ileus; however, obstruction cannot be excluded.
HD 1- She was transferred from an OSH with the chief complaint of acute onset of lower back pain and a CT scan s/o increase in size of her preexisting AAA.
her pain was well controlled with IV morphine and she remained hemodynamically stable.
Also, there was a deacrease in the hourly urine output.
HD 5 - She started complaining of pain in the left hip in the morning.
She was hen sent down for an XR of the hip that showed no e/o any fracture.
HD 6 - She started complaining of increased abdominal pain and was slightly tender on physical examination.
A CT scan of the abdomen was done to diagnose an increase in size of the AAA and any other ongoing pathological process.
She c/o nausea on multiple occasions following which an EKG was done to r/o ongoing myocardial ischemia.
HD 8 - Ciprofloxacin and FLagyl were started due to concern for bowel ischemia.
Starting on HD 9, patient began to have worsening crampy abdominal pain.
General surgery was re-consulted and did not feel that this was due to the patient's ventral hernia, and suggested no intervention.
This new pain was also not felt to be due to her AAA.
Geriatrics was consulted and felt this was likely due to her colonic stricture that was diagnosed a year prior after a lower GI bleed episode.
On HD11, patient finally began to have severaly loose stools, and began to feel much better.
GI was also consulted and suggested that if she has these obstructive symptoms again that a stent could be considered for palliation.
HD 12 - She began complaining of jaw pain and was evaluated by OMFS service.
Their evaluation was that she had a close lock consistent with anterior displaced disc without reduction and recommended a soft diet and  motrin 600mg prn and heat pack to the face if pain developed/persisted.
Given her several cardiac problems, it was deemed too risky to proceed with surgery.
The patient and the family agreed with this and she was discharged to rehab in stable condition without any acute issues.
