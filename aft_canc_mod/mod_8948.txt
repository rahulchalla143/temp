Prelim report showed AVM and angioectasias without blood in lumen  Brief Hospital Course: 47 year old male with history of AVR w/ St. Jude's valve (in [**2173**]) on coumadin, CHF, HLD, OSA on BiPAP, asthma, recent admission for asthma flare and low hemoglobin (suspected GIB) at [**Hospital 27217**] Hospital, presents with melena followed by bright red bloody stool.
Capsule endoscopy final report was pending at discharge, however preliminary report showed an AVM, angioectasias and no evidence of blood in the small bowel.
Acute GI bleed was felt to be due to bleeding from AVM in the setting of an elevated INR.
# Microcytic Anemia: MCV 75.
This was felt to be due to chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, likely from anticoagulation and multiple AVMs, worsened acutely by significant GI bleed.
Patient had evidence of minimal intravascular hemolysis with an elevated LDH and low haptoglobin, which was felt to be a result of being given PRBCs.
# Colonic Polyp: Single sessile 6 mm polyp of benign appearance seen on colonoscopy, not intervened upon given high INR.
# Aortic Valve Replacement: S/p [**Hospital3 **] prosthetic valve, on Coumadin at home, and supratherapeutic INR on presentation to OSH (which often fluctuates, per patient).
Cardiology was consulted and felt that given valve location (aortic) and type (bileaflet), it was appropriate not bridge with heparin and permit INR to drift down in setting of a GI bleed, with the thought that once the INR was <1.7, we could start a heparin drip if still concerned for bleeding.
On admission, patient was hypovolemic and showed no signs of volume overload after 2units of PRBCs.
He showed no signs of CHF during his hospitalization, thus his Lasix was held.
# Asthma: Recent exacerbation, s/p prednisone taper.
We continued his home inhalers and he remained asymptomatic in the hospital.
We discontinued the Lasix given clinical stability and no signs of volume overload 2.
