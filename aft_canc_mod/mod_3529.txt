Lymphovascular invasion was present as well.
The tumor was grade [**1-31**].
Imaging ultimately revealed recurrent disease in the spine.
Hypertension 3.

Pertinent Results: [**2167-9-30**] Pleural fluid: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS; consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma.
Admission CXR [**2167-9-27**] In comparison with the study of [**9-21**], there is little change in the bilateral pleural effusions, more prominent on the left.
The area of increased opacification at the right base has not progressed and may well have represented only fortuitous superimposition of vascular structures.
Some atelectatic change is seen in the retrocardiac region.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 53 yo F with metastatic breast ca and known bilateral pleural effusions admitted with dyspnea for pleurodesis.
# Dyspnea: Initially admitted with dyspnea due to bilateral pleural effusion, underwent L pleurodesisi with chesttube placement.
Respirations improved however pt did not feel that she could lay flat due to fear of dyspnea as well as pain for MRI lumbar area that had been scheduled to evaluate for mets to spine.
CT was d/c'ed without incidence - no pneumothorax.
# Respiratory distress: Developed acidemia and hypoxia after overdose on Dilaudid PCA pump.
Hypercarbic respiratory failure improved without intubation, however required BIPAP.
# Acute renal failure: Pt developed acute renal failure while in the intensive care unit.
FeNa < 1%, Cr.levels improved daily with gentle rehydration.
# T/L spine metastasis: Although no worsening of symptoms currently, she was scheduled for outpt MRI, however was unable to lay flat due to orthopnea related to L pleural effusion.
After b/l pleural effusions had been drained, pt was reluctant to undergo the MRI in house in part due to fear of orthopnea when flat and pain.
# Hypertension: Was well controlled on home regimen metoprolol 100mg daily.
# Pain: From L pleurodesis and s/p CT placement/removal, had been placed on dilaudid PCP for pain control however overdosed and had [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay.
