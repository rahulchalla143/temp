Admission Date:  [**2134-11-22**]       Discharge Date: [**2134-12-3**]   Service:  Medicine  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Right-sided chest pain x2-3 days.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and a history of pulmonary emboli in [**2116**] and [**2128**] who is here for right-sided chest pain which began two to three days prior to admission at [**Hospital1 **] Rehabilitation Center.
The pain was non-radiating and intermittent.
The patient complained that the pain was severe and sharp on the day of admission and worse with deep breathing.
There was no accompanying nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis or shortness of breath.
The patient has had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation two to three days per day sometimes but not recently.
The patient has had no recent leg trauma.
He had stopped Coumadin in [**2130**] and otherwise had not noticed any sudden sharp pain, had not had any episodes of syncope and had not noticed any shortness of breath.
The patient also has not noticed any recent leg swelling or redness.
He has been on bedrest for the past two and a half weeks secondary to his recent stroke.
The patient claims that his recent cerebrovascular accident left him with dizziness and numbness.
Per report, on a recent CT scan, the patient had diffusion abnormalities in the right occipital region and also in the right medullary region of his brain.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for pulmonary emboli in [**2116**] and [**2128**].
The patient also has a history of a recent stroke leaving him with "lateral medullary syndrome".
The patient's past medical history is also significant for pneumonia with ARDS in [**2129-2-5**] and Legionella pneumonia in [**2129-5-5**].
The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
He has a history of coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2121**] and coronary artery bypass grafting.
The patient has a history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, status post repair in [**2121**].
He has a history of hypercholesterolemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, status post splenectomy, and hairy cell leukemia.
The patient is status post hernia repair and has a history of hypothyroidism and depression.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies, but he had had a reaction to formaldehyde in the past which caused him to have difficulty breathing.
Dry mucous membranes.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Status post splenectomy and hernia repair.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
No calf swelling or tenderness.
No cords palpated.
Occasional bizarre comments such as the patient attributing his first pulmonary embolus to being out in the heat for to long.
Cranial nerves II, III, IV, VI, VII, IX, X, [**Doctor First Name 81**] and XII grossly intact except for a right facial droop.
In the lower extremities, the patient could name the correct side and area that was touched, but, if touched on the right leg and asked to lift that leg, the patient moved his left leg.
Coordination:  The patient had significant dysmetria with finger-to-nose testing.
Gait was deferred secondary to the increased fall risk secondary to lateral medullary syndrome and secondary to his dizziness and light-headedness from his pulmonary embolus.
We were concerned at that time about increased bleeding risk with a fall given that the patient was no a Heparin drip and supratherapeutic at that time.
Urinalysis showed a large amount of blood, positive nitrites, small leukocyte esterase, 21-50 white blood cells, many bacteria, no yeast and less than 1 epithelial cell.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 68 beats per minute with occasional PVCs.
There was left atrial enlargement and normal axis and intervals.
The PR interval appeared to be okay despite the patient's history of AV conduction block.
There were Q waves in 3, AVF, V1 and V2, and ST depression in V2 through V4 with T wave flattening laterally.
This was unchanged from a previous EKG, and the patient was ruled out x3 for a myocardial infarction.
The patient's chest x-ray was generally negative except for a tortuous and dilated aorta.
A CT angiogram showed non-occlusive pulmonary embolism in the right upper lobe, aneurysmal dilatation at the origin of the left subclavian artery, dilatation of the ectatic portion of the aorta at the diaphragmatic hiatus and emphysema.
Given his recent stroke, the patient also had a CT of the head performed which showed probable diffuse ectasia and multiple areas of atherosclerotic calcification within the tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**], probable polypoid area of mucosal thickening partially obscuring the left sphenoid air cells, to a lesser degree within both ethmoid sinuses and to a minimal degree within the right maxillary sinus.
There was no radiologic evidence for major vascular territorial infarction that appeared acute.
This showed micro-vascular disease changes with no clear evidence of brainstem infarction identifiable.
This was thought to be related to slow flow in this vessel, occlusion or the presence of a posterior inferior cerebellar arterial continuation of the right vertebral.
The patient also had a MRI of his spine given his bilateral lower extremity complaints.
MRI of the cervical spine showed changes of cervical spondylosis with a large right-sided disc osteophyte complex at the C3-C4 level with severe narrowing of the right neural foramen.
There was no evidence of spinal stenosis or extrinsic spinal cord compression.
MRI of the thoracic spine showed degenerative changes with no evidence of intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities in the thoracic region.
MRI of the lumbar spine showed multilevel degenerative changes in the lumbar region without spinal stenosis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the above, the patient was admitted to the Medicine Service and was treated for his pulmonary embolus with a Heparin drip and Coumadin.
For his neurologic complaints, the patient was seen by the Neurology Service.
He also had an extensive workup done to evaluate his neurologic complaints, and it was thought that the patient's fluctuating and vague neurologic symptoms were probably secondary to decreased perfusion secondary to his orthostatic hypotension.
At one point, however, during his hospital stay, the patient became significant orthostatic and had increased neurologic complaints as well as chest pain.
The patient also had a CT scan of the abdomen performed given his neurologic complaints in the bilateral lower extremities.
Prior repair of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm; aneurysmal dilatation of the abdominal aorta at the level of the diaphragm measuring 5.7 x 5.7 cm; chronically thrombosed lumen of the aorta.
Complete occlusion of the right internal iliac artery just distal to the graft.
The lower extremity arterial duplex scan showed significant right iliac occlusive disease.
On the left, there was mild tibial artery disease.
Cardiac:  The patient continued to have paroxysmal atrial fibrillation throughout his hospital stay, generally without symptoms.
The Medicine Service was reluctant, at first, to begin any beta blockers or calcium channel blockers given the patient's history of AV conduction block and given his fluctuating neurologic symptoms with decreased blood pressure.
Otherwise, for his history of coronary artery disease, the patient was continued on aspirin and Plavix.
The patient had complained of chest pain at multiple times throughout his hospital stay which was probably secondary to his pulmonary embolus.
However, he was ruled out for myocardial infarction each time and otherwise was continued on telemetry generally throughout his hospital stay.
Hematology:  The patient was found to have an erythrocytosis with a hematocrit which fluctuated between 45 and 50.
They felt that phlebotomy was not necessary at this time and that the erythrocytosis may be secondary to dehydration and chronic hypoxemia secondary to pulmonary emboli and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
The patient also complained of some right eye pain for which Ophthalmology was consulted.
They recommended Erythromycin eyedrops for presumed conjunctivitis and more frequent lubricants and hot compresses.
The patient's eye pain resolved throughout his hospital stay.
Infectious Disease:  The patient also had a urinary tract infection on admission with symptoms or urinary retention.
The patient had a repeat urinalysis sent later on to evaluate lytes, and this urinalysis showed no signs of infection.
The patient's Flomax was discontinued during his stay secondary to concerns over his blood pressure and may be restarted prior to his discharge if the patient continues to complain of urinary retention.
The patient was able to tolerate longer periods of movement and increased activity without symptoms.
