Bronchoscopy [**11-26**] demonstrated no abnormality postop.
CXR on [**12-2**] demonstrated LUL collapse and a bronchoscopy was performed with mucus plug extraction.
Throughout the next several days Ms. [**Known lastname 56839**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] daily bronchoscopy as she continued to have L-sided mucus plugging with LUL collapse on CXR.
Repeat bronchoscopy on [**12-5**] and [**12-6**] yielded decreasing amounts of mucus and on [**12-6**] her CXR began to show signs of improvement.
Meanwhile her O2 requrement decreased from nightly CPAP to 6L O2 by NC and finally to 3L O2 by NC with pulmonary toilet.
GI:  Diet was NPO for the first 48 hours postoperatively and then advanced to a regular diet, which she tolerated without difficulty.
GU:  A foley catheter remained in place until [**12-5**] due to her poor mobility and decreased urinary continence at baseline.
It was replaced [**12-6**] after multiple episodes of incontinence overnight.
WBC remained < 10 and she was afebrile throughout her hospital course.
Endo:  Regular insulin sliding scale was used for hyperglycemic control.
The following summarizes her hospital course from [**12-6**] to [**12-10**]:  On [**12-6**] (POD10) patient was transferred to the floor after a bronch revealing no mucous plug and a post-bronch CXR that showed improved aeration of the left lung.
Between POD12 and POD14 she continued to improve progressively from a respiratory standpoint and walking short distances progressively.
No evidence of UTI was found during her hospital stay and this will be pulled at her rehab facility.
Her CXRs continued to show a moderate amount of pleural fluid on the left base, so it was felt that she would benefit from an ultrasound with possible tap of her pleural effusion.
Interventional pulmonology was able to drain 800cc of serosanguinous fluid and samples were sent for analysis, culture and cytology (pending).
She felt her breathing was better after that and will continue to work on her incentive spirometer, and overall pulmonary toilet.
Bumex 1mg tab daily or more as needed for fluid retention.
