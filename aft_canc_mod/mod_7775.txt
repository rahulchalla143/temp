She was then admitted from [**Date range (1) 93815**] for part B hyper CVAD and developed febrile neutropenia with fevers to 101.7 in the clinic.
She developed rhinorrhea and nasal congestion 2 days after being d/c'ed.
She then developed fevers to 101.
She continued to experience dyspnea, and CT scan performed on [**2-18**] showed bilateral infiltrates/opacities, concerning for infection (?
She was was started on antifungals receiving her first dose on [**2-17**] along with levofloxacin on [**2-19**] for atypical coverage.
Later that day she had an an increasing O2 requirement from 94% on 2L to 90% on 3L to 100% on NRB.
Pt was visibly tachypneic and using accessory muscles to breathe.
In the ICU pt improved overnight with gentle diuresis.
Past Medical History: 1) ALL, Precursor B-phenotype (Induction with Hyper-CVAD [**2113-1-7**], Negative for [**Location (un) 5622**] Chromosome) ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Obtained from chart review: 58 yo female with a h/o hypothyroidism who presents for evaluation of possible ALL.
Pt was in USOH until [**12-12**], when she had a cold with dry cough, fevers and chills, all improved by [**12-18**].
After a few days, pt had vomiting, abdominal pain, and fatigue increasing for about a week until [**12-28**], when the pt went to [**Hospital1 3793**] for the above symptoms.
She was found to have an enlarged spleen and thrombocytopenia.
The patient was admitted on [**2113-1-6**] for diagnosis and initiation of treatment.
Bone marrow biopsy was performed on admission and interpreted as markedly hypercellular bone marrow with involvement by Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Precursor B-phenotype.
Her course was complicated by febrile neutropenia with blood cultures showing vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus.
Screening blood cultures were subsequently all negative after initiation of vancomycin.
A TTE was negative for endocarditis.
Rare EtOH use, no smoking, no IVDU.
Family History: Aunts and Uncles with breast CA and asbestos related lung CA by report.
HEENT: Anicteric sclerae, moist mucous membranes.
tachycardic LUNGS: Dry inspiratory crackles to 2/3 up from the bases.
CXR [**2113-2-19**]: Worsening appearance of the chest with an appearance which is suggestive of developing fluid overload or edema.
Chest CT with contrast [**2113-2-18**] When compared with the prior study from [**2113-1-24**], new small bilateral parenchymal opacities are noted associated with ground glass opacities and septal thickening.
Echo [**2113-1-25**] Left Atrium 4.0 cm x 4.5 cm, right atrium 4.6 cm, LV thickness = 1.3 cm, Ejection Fraction = 70% to 80%, nml TRTR Gradient (+ RA = PASP): 19 to 21 mm Hg (nl <= 25 mm Hg) Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and hyperdynamic systolic function (LVEF>70-80%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The slightly increased transaortic gradient is likely related to high cardiac output.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
58 year old female with hypothyroidism, HTN, history of vancomycin sensitive enterococcus, and ALL (Precursor B-phenotype, [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome negative) who was admitted for febrile neutropenia.
She was then transferred to the ICU with hypoxia and febrile neutropenia.
# Respiratory Distress: The patient was on room air on admission but on her second hospital day as her ANC rose to > 500, she was found to have a new oxygen requirement with desaturation to 89% on room air.
A chest CT showed new bilateral parenchymal pulmonary opacities consistent with an infectious process.
No PE was seen on the CT chest.
The patient's oxygen requirement worsened and she was transferred to the ICU for further monitoring.
On transfer to the ICU, Levofloxacin was added for double coverage of gram negatives.
An induced sputum showed gram negative rods but these were consistent with mouth flora per the microbiology lab.
Upon transfer back to the BMT floor, a repeat CT scan showed worsened, extensive bilateral ground glass opacities sparing the lower lobes which appeared to be consistent with an infectious process.
Her oxygen requirement decreased steadily until she was back on room air.
# Pulmonary edema: A chest xray in the MICU showed evidence of developing fluid overload or edema.
# Febrile Neutropenia: Given her history of vancomycin sensitive enterococus, the patient was continued on Vancomycin and started on Cefepime.
Also at this time, the patient's pulmonary status declined markedly requiring transfer to the ICU.
Caspofungin was added when the patient began to have worsening respiratory function.
This was discontinued in ICU after improvement in her oxygen saturation and a CXR not c/w fungal pneumonia.
A Beta-glucan was found to be positive with CT scan showing ground glass opacities sparing the bases.
Hematopath reviewed the diff and found early neutrophil precursors consistent with Neulasta effect and not consistent with leukemia.
Her Fluconazole and Levofloxacin were discontinued given that she was no longer neutropenic.. .
Primary: Febrile Neutropenia PCP Pneumonia ALL .
Secondary: Hypothyroidism Hypertension .
- You may stop taking Levofloxacin and Fluconazole now that your WBC has come back up.
Please call your doctor immediately if you begin to experience increasing shortness of breath, fevers, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
