Admission Date:  [**2128-11-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2128-12-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2069-8-10**]       Sex:  F  Service:  Blue General Surgery HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 45627**] is a 59-year-old female who is otherwise healthy, who presented with a several month history of distal bile duct stricture, jaundice, and a 37 pound weight loss occurring over approximately four months.
Recently prior to her Whipple procedure, she underwent a esophagogastroduodenoscopy with stent change by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and this had shown a mass pushing on the duodenum consistent with a pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
She had prior CT scans that really did not show anything consistent with an actual mass.
Although on her prior scans, they did show a segment seven lesion in the liver that was approximately 1.5 cm in diameter that was suspicious for possible metastatic disease.
Drainage output from her J-P drain was followed serially to make sure that there was no evidence of a pancreatic leak or fistula.
There was no apparent leak and an opacification of the left and right biliary ducts were demonstrated.
The tip of the T tube had appeared to be in the common hepatic duct and the ducts were mildly prominent, but no focal abnormalities were identified.
On postoperative day #8, she was noted to have some mild distention, nausea, and vomiting.
The drains were seen posterior to the stomach and the drainage tube to the right upper quadrant was also seen consistent with a recent Whipple procedure.
The distribution of gas within the abdomen was otherwise unremarkable and there was no evidence of frank obstruction seen, and there was no free air seen.
Given her distended stomach and her evidence of nausea and vomiting, it was likely she was suffering from delayed gastric emptying.
Intermittently, she would do well, however, this will be followed by episodes of nausea and vomiting.
A CT scan was acquired on postoperative day #15 to rule out any abnormal fluid collection, abscess, etc to explain why she may in-fact be having difficulty with oral intake and nausea and emesis.
CT scan at that time showed postsurgical changes that were noted in the region of the pancreatic body consistent with the patient's recent Whipple procedure, but there were no abnormal fluid collections or abscess formations seen given a relatively normal study.
Abdomen was soft and nontender.
Neurologically she had a nonfocal examination.
Given all of these findings and her overall clinical improvement, it was deemed that she was appropriate and stable for discharge.
The patient has had all of these issues explained extensively.
The final pathology shows frozen sections revealed left lateral segment bile duct hemartoma with lymph node showing lipogranuloma, but no carcinoma.
She had a left hepatic artery lymph node that showed no carcinoma just lipogranuloma.
The proximal bile duct margin showed no cancer.
She did have a liver nodule to 1.5 cm nodule previously mentioned.
Was sent for frozen section that just showed a dense nodule with focal calcification and chronic inflammation, but no evidence of malignancy.
The mass from the head of her pancreas revealed a pancreatic adenocarcinoma that was moderately differentiated.
There was evidence of vascular invasion.
There was extensive perineural invasion.
Otherwise, there is no local organ invasion.
The Reglan and erythromycin will be for procanetic agents.
Additionally she can take Percocet 5/225 1-2 tablets po q4-6 prn pain as well as being recommended to utilize a stool softener, Colace 100 mg po bid, and Bisacodyl 10 mg pr q day prn.
Her discharge instructions are to encourage her po intake [**4-12**] Boost cans per day, to keep track of her caloric intake, and take a documented diary of her nutritional input.
