He had an MRI showing a right temporal tumor enlarged when compared to MRI done in [**6-/2170**] when he had a CVA.
EEG showed no seizures at the time of recording.
Coronary disease as noted above.
Currently, free of any typical anginal symptoms.
A recent Persantine myocardial perfusion study negative for any fixed or reversible defects.
Peripheral vascular disease status post bilateral lower extremity revascularization procedure.
Carotid disease status post right carotid endarterectomy at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital in the fall of [**2169**].
He is being followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] locally for asymptomatic moderate left system disease, which is being treated conservatively.
History of mild mitral regurgitation by remote echocardiography, but most recent study did not reveal any significant valvular abnormalities.
History of spinal stenosis status post surgical intervention.
History of small abdominal aortic aneurysm, which is followed locally with annual ultrasounds.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
This mass is consistent with a meningioma.
CT Head [**9-18**] Post op Status post resection of right frontal meningioma with postoperative pneumocephalus and small amount of hemorrhage.
There is resulting edema with effacement of the right suprasellar cistern, which could indicate an impending uncal herniation  CXR [**2172-9-19**] The NG tube tip is in the stomach.
There is mild pulmonary vascular redistribution.
There is probable small left pleural effusion that is new compared to the prior study.
EEG [**2172-9-20**] This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of continuous focal slowing, attenuation of faster frequencies, frequent epileptiform discharges in the right centroparietal region, and frequent electrographic seizures over the right frontotemporal region.
These findings are indicative of an epileptogenic focal structural lesion in the right hemisphere, giving rise to frequent (58) right frontotemporal electrographic seizures.
In addition, there is diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm, indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
Compared to the prior day's recording, electrographic seizures have increased in frequency, but the background activity is unchanged.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS [**2172-9-24**] No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
Unchanged right MCA territory infarct with mild internal hemorrhage.
Large subacute infarct in the right frontal and temporal lobes.
Postoperative changes of the right frontal and temporal skull and scalp.
Stable small amount of intraventricular blood in the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles.
No evidence of herniation or obstructive hydrocephalus.
Small 1- to 2-mm outpouchings along the distal aspect of the M1 segment of the right MCA, possible infundibular dilatation of normal branch vessles or true aneurysms.
Persistent relatively low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities most likely reflecting patchy atelectasis though an infectious process cannot be entirely excluded.
No pleural effusions or pulmonary edema.
No large pneumothorax although evaluation is limited as the patient is likely supine on the current examination.
Mild improvement in the degree of pulmonary vascular distention.
No evidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
CXR portalbe [**9-29**]: improved left basilar atelectasis, stable rightsided atelectasis  CXR portable [**9-30**]: stable appearance of lungs compared with prior xray  CXR Portable [**10-1**]:SEMI-ERECT PORTABLE CHEST: A nasogastric tube again passes into the stomach and off the inferior margin of the film.
The lungs are unchanged in appearance with persistent low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.
No new opacity to suggest pneumonia.
No pneumothorax or large effusion.
There is bronchovascular crowding and mild vascular congestion without convincing evidence of pulmonary edema.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2172-10-1**] 1:37 PM FINDINGS: There is persistent hypodensity in the right operculum, consistent with evolution of infarct in the right MCA territory.
There is less conspicuous involvement of the right temporal lobe.
There is no shift of midline structures.
A small amount of dependent layering blood in the occipital horns of the lateral ventricle is unchanged from NECT of the head on [**2172-9-25**].
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
The ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with age-related atrophy.
Postsurgical changes from right frontoparietal craniotomy are again noted.
Pneumocephalus noted on prior NECT of the head is resolved.
No evidence of mass effect.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
There is some atelectasis at the left lung base.
There are no pneumothoraces or pleural effusions.
LENIs [**10-5**] - negative for DVT  CXR [**2172-10-7**] 1.
There is no pneumothorax.
Left lower lung atelectasis has worsened since [**2172-10-3**].
Pneumoperitoneum, most likely related to recent PEG, as suggested from the clinical history.
No evidence of fracture or dislocation  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 96140**] was admitted to Neurosurgery on [**2172-9-18**] and underwent a right frontal craniotomy for tumor resection.
He apeared to be a bit lethargic on exam on post operative day one and per nursing report he was intermitantly not moving his left arm which could be consistant with subclinical seizures.
Over the weekend of [**2091-9-19**] he continued to have focal seizures and his daily dose was again increased to 1250mg [**Hospital1 **].
CT head showed a right sided stroke and he was transfered to the ICU.
Repeat head CT performed overnight for increased lethargy showed stable stoke.
EEG was negative for seizure activity.
neurology felt the the stroke was post operative in nature and not do to an embolic source.
Echo was negative and carotid u/s revealed 60-65% stenosis in Right ICA.
He was given 2 units or PRBC's for a dropping Hct.
He was extubated and became stridorous and required reintubation.
Patient's keppra was decreased from 1250 to 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] and EEG over the weekend were negative for seizure activity.
On [**10-1**] he was lethargic and CT showed evolving CVA .He remained in the unit.
PT and OT were consulted for assistance with discharge planning.A chest xray was performed which was consistent no new relevant changes in the lungs.
Minimal bibasal atelectasis is unchanged.
There are no new lung opacities of concern.
On [**10-1**], A Head CT was performed due to lethargy which was consistent with evolving right MCA infarct, no evidence of mass effect or intracranial hemorrhage.
The patient stayed in the Intensive Care Unit for lethragy and inability to clear respiratory secretions.
He was unable to transfer out of the ICU today due to increase respiratory secretions.
LENIs was obtained on [**10-5**] which demonstrated no DVT.
The patient failed her Speech Swallow test.
The ACS service was consulted for placement of a Gastric Tube.
ASA/Plavix were not held due to his recent CVA.
At 4pm he had 55 cc of bright red blood and lcot suctioned from his mouth but there was no sign of acute bleeding.
The next day he was without further bleeding from the mouth.
CXR ruled out pneumothroax with some mild pneumoperitoneum from his procedure.
He had some left foot pain and X-ray showed no fracture or dislocation.
