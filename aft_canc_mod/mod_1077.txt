VS at this time noted to be HR 80-90, BP 230/130 (unclear if accurate read due to location of BP cuff) and O2sat 70%.
During code pt found to be in resp distress with RR 30 and O2sat 80% on NRB.
Pt received Lasix 80mg IV for presumed flash pulm edema given hx of recent admission ([**2174-9-20**]) for CHF exacerbation, Nitro gtt for BP control and was intubated for ventilation.
Pt transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after intbation and found to be hypotensive transiently.
CXR revealed pulm edema.

## Resp failure - Felt to be secondary to flash pulm edema likely secondary to hypertensive event during procedure.
Pt had transient hypotension after intubation possible secondary to combination of sedation and PEEP with decrease in preload.
However, sepsis vs cardiogenic shock consideredbut BP improved with no intervention.
## Cardiac - Pt has an extensive cardiac hx.
Was experiencing nausea prior to event which could have represented an inferior MI.
- Pt was on coumadin as outpt for afib which was held for procedure.
Restart if stable and no furhter procedures planned.
## Anemia - Patient has a low Hct at baseline (around 33) and has had a AAA repair with known endoleak.
He was hemodynamically stable throughout his last admission and was transfused 1 unit PRBC for slowly decreasing hct with nadir of 25.7.
Iron studies were consistent with iron deficiency anemia and he was started on ferrous sulfate.
CT scan of abdomen/pelvis was obtained to assess for interval change of the AAA repair site and endo leak, which showed no significant change.
Pt was having colonoscopy to asses for source of bleed.
## HTN - Pt on Amiodarone, Lopressor, and Lasix as an outpatient.
## ID: placed on cefpodoxime (originally on ceftriaxone) because of pulmonary infiltrates.
