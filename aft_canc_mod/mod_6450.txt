He was noted to be alert and oriented yesterday with change in mental status to confusion to year and somnolence along with increased work of breathing this morning.
ABG on room air showed alkalosis with 7.55/46/63.
CXR showed no acute process on my read though cannot completely rule out LLL process in setting of AP CXR with cardiomegaly.
We evaluated him at that time, and his lungs were clear, and had no signs of fluid overload.
A CTA Chest was performed that did not show evidence of PE, but did show evidence of PNA.
The evening of [**2116-12-29**] he was found to be in respiratory distress and hypoxic with O2 sat of 30%.
On exam he had extremely poor air movement, wheezing, and extended expiratory phase.
He was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and transferred to the MICU.

Surgical clips are noted along the left mediastinal border with extensive scarring and upward hilar retraction.
There is volume loss in the left lung compatible with prior partial lung resection with partial osteotomy in the left rib cage.
No evidence of pneumonia.
Right hilar prominence.
FINDINGS: There is a new large left lower lobe consolidation and small right upper lobe consolidation, concerning for pneumonia.
There is increased right upper lobe bronchial wall thickening, also suggestive of infection.
There is a new small right pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax is seen.
The pulmonary arteries appear patent to the subsegmental levels without evidence for pulmonary embolus.
Left upper lobe lobectomy changes are again seen with left-sided volume loss.
No pericardial effusion is seen.
This study is not optimized for evaluation of subdiaphragmatic structures.
Within this limitation, there appear to be innumerable new hypodensities within the liver, concerning for metastases.
Bilateral adrenal glands are markedly enlarged compared to prior, also concerning for metastases.
Few arterial calcifications are noted.
No concerning lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are detected.
Large left lower lobe consolidation and small focus of consolidation in the right upper lobe with right upper lobe bronchial wall thickening, concerning for infection.
New small right pleural effusion.
Multiple new hypodense lesions in the liver, incompletely evaluated, but concerning for metastatic disease.
Markedly enlarged adrenal glands bilaterally, also concerning for metastatic disease.
Increased size of right hilar lymph node, may be related to infection although increased metastasis cannot be excluded.
TECHNIQUE: Given the patient's inability to cooperate, the study was limited and no contrast enhanced images were obtained.
There is no new midline shift or hydrocephalus.
Metastatic, partly cystic masses in the left parietotemporal lobe as well as the left cerebellar hemisphere appear grossly unchanged from the previous exam.
While small new lesions cannot be excluded, there is no evidence of major progress with new significant mass effect.
There is no evidence of ischemic infarct on well diagnostic diffusion weighted images.
Incidental note is made of persistent sinusitis involving the ethmoid and bilateral maxillary sinuses.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of significant progression of metastatic disease in this limited study.
No evidence of acute ischemic infarct or major hemorrhage.
[**2117-1-6**] RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of right internal jugular, right subclavian, axillary, and brachial veins were performed.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 88504**] is a 59 year old male with history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with metastases to brain status post chemotherapy and radiation, admitted with profound weakness, found to have hypokalemia, high serum ACTH, and hypercortisolism secondary to bilateral adrenal hyperplasia; hospital course complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure, shock, delirium, pneumonia, and thrush.
Due to progressive illness with poor prognosis, .
ACUTE ISSUES: # Hypokalemia/hyperaldersteronism: Patient's presenting symptom was progressive weakness over the weeks prior to admission, with subsequent decreased PO intake.
He was found to have low potassium at PCP's office and referred to ED where K was 2.6.
Patient had associated symptom of hypertension, mood changes and delirium prior to and during his admission.
On further testing, the patient was found to have elevated cortisol levels, peaking at 219, with elevated serum ACTH (319) and normal aldosterone.
Lab values and imaging were thought to be consistent with hypercortisolemia from bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, which was likely secondary to an ACTH-secreting tumor.
The Urology team did not believe the patient was a good candidate for palliative bilateral adrenalectomy.
# Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: While on the medicine floor initially, patient had been on room air, but began to have desaturations to high 80%s, and was tachycardic.
Acute episode of respiratory failure was multifactorial, secondary to pneumonia, baseline decreased pulmonary function from COPD and lung cancer, and profound muscle weakness/fatigue secondary to hypokalemia: CTA was performed which ruled out PE but did show large left lower lobe consolidation and small focus of consolidation in the right upper lobe with right upper lobe bronchial wall thickening, concerning for infection, for which vanc/cefepime were started empirically.
For continued desaturations likely secondary to diaphragmatic fatigue and possible bronchospam, patient was found to be hypercarbic (pCO2 109, pH 7.14), intubated and transferred to the ICU.
He was then continued on empiric antibiotics and standing albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers, along with supplemental oxygen as needed, with improved symptoms during the rest of his admission.
# Delirium: Over the course of the hospitalization, patient was noted to have labile mental status.
Symptoms were much better controlled with suppression of cortisol, along with consistent family involvement, frequent reorientation, and standing/PRN lorazepam.
# Pneumonia: Noted to have a large left lower lobe consolidation and small focus of consolidation in the right upper lobe with right upper lobe bronchial wall thickening, concerning for infection, along with a small right pleural effusion.
Patient was continued on albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers for symptoms of shortness of breath/wheezing and comfort.
# Thrush: Patient was noted to have white plaques at back of tongue and roof of mouth consistent with thrush.
# Small cell lung cancer: Stage IV, with poor prognosis of weeks to months; with metastases involving the brain and liver.
Due to high levels of serum cortisol, it was suspected that the patient's cancer is secreting ectopic ACTH.
There will not be any future surgical or chemotherapeutic interventions.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # Goals of care: Patient has now undergone a complicated hospital course, including an ICU stay for respiratory failure; however, his stage IV lung cancer bears a poor prognosis.
