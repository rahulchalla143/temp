She then underwent reindunction with 7+3 with MMUD allo-BMT c/b abdominal abcess, CHF, respiratory distress 2ndary to fluid overload, or less likely, pneumonitis (due to CMV+ or capillary leak syndrome), hyperbili, and renal failure.
Pt's renal failure and hyperbili resolved.
Was treated primarily for CHF with lisinopril and Lasix PRN.
Off Hi-flow mask and Sats >93% on 6LNC-->5LNC  Pt admitted from clinic after presented with one day of abd cramping, vomiting and diarrhea.
No fevers at home, but spiked fever on admission.

She was transfusion dependent throughout her hospital course, for plt and Hct with parameters for plt transfusion for Plt<10 or Plt<20 if bleeding.
Jaw pain with tender right lower tooth, written for oxycodone; CT mandible negative.
3) Pneumonia/pneumonitis: CXR on [**7-5**] showed diffuse infiltrates in RML, RLL and LUL.
Switched over to prednisone 30mg po qd for GVHD pneumonitis.
Pt has had in past but has increased and is now large effusion with brief R atrial collapse.
Serial TTE showed no change.
5) CHF: severe L venrtricular hypokenesis [**2-7**] chemo and BMT.
In the ICU, she had respiratory distress and intubation [**2-7**] fluid overload vs. capillary leak/pneumonitis;  After daily diuresis in the MICU and then only as needed on the floor, the patient had rapid improvement, suggesting that the largest component of the respiratory distress was volume overload.
Weaned captopril because of renal insufficiency.
6) Renal: Increased Creatinine secondary to diuresis and decreased intravascular volume.
7) Hx of abd abcess with gram neg bacteremia.
No further abdominal complaints on floor.
No signs of GI GVHD during remainder of hospital course.
8) FEN: Nutrition consulted for low PO's and felt that pt had enuogh POs to not require TPN.
Physical therapy consulted and rec'd home with PT secondary to poor balance.
