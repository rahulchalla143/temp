Admission Date:  [**2136-3-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-3-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2073-12-16**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**] Chief Complaint: lower extremity swelling  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
History of Present Illness: 62 yo F w/ metastatic pancreatic cancer s/p Whipple procedure in [**2131**] currently C1D19 Gemcitabine presenting with 2-3 weeks of leg swelling.
She reports ~3 weeks of lower extremity swelling.
She denies pain but feels that her legs are heavy and she is having difficulty ambulating.
Past Medical History: Ms. [**Known lastname 14840**] has chronic pancreatitis with exocrine and endocrine insufficiency, status post Whipple surgery by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] in [**9-22**].
Pathology from this surgery revealed chronic pancreatitis as well as low-grade dysplasia, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasm.
She was doing fairly well until [**2-24**], when she noted weight loss and abdominal pain similar to her previous pancreatitis pain.
At that time, MRI abdomen was notable for an irregular duct but no stricture at the pancreaticojejunostomy site.
By [**5-25**], her CA [**47**]-9 has risen from 13 to 143 as well as her CEA was elevated at 4.6.
She had an EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] on [**2135-6-14**], notable for gastritis.
She continued to note weight loss and pain, so she had a CTA abd in [**9-25**] notable for a pancreatic tail mass extending into the mesentery, occluding the splenic vein and encasing the splenic artery.
She underwent an EGD and EUS which showed a 3 cm hypoechoic mass in the body of the pancreas in [**10-25**].
Her first cycle has been c/b low counts, thrush treated with fluconazole and lower extremity edema.
Chronic Pancreatitis as above.
HTN   Social History: (+) tobacco use - 20 pack year - currently [**4-26**] cigarettes per day.
Her mother's mom had stomach cancer and her mother's brother had liver cancer.
[**12-24**] pearly nodules on tongue.
NODES:  No supraclavicular, submandibular, cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Mild pain to palpation LUandLLQ.
No masses palpated.
EXTREMITIES: Cool, 3+ edema feet and ankles, symmetric, pitting.
No palpable cords or calf tenderness.
2x3cm macular rash on left foot and Weeping blisters on tops of feet.
No redness, warmth.
SKIN: Otherwise without lesions except ecchymoses on UE.
LE - quads/hamstrings/DF/PF - [**3-24**] if isolate and support feet which she reports are too heavy.
Unable to wiggle toes due to swelling.
Pertinent Results: CXR - The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits, and there is no pulmonary vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or other evidence of CHF.
Dilated loop of excluded jejunum (s/p Whipple), which may be due to the necrotic pancreatic tail mass, an adhesion, or stricture/ swelling at the anastomotic site.
This loop does appear to be compressing the IVC at the level of the aortic bifurcation, though no significant venous collaterals are seen suggesting that there is not complete occlusion.
Mild right hydronephrosis and hydroureter of unknown etiology.
Necrotic pancreatic tail mass which appears slightly smaller than the prior exam, however, this may be due to distortion of abdominal contents due to the dilated small bowel loops.
CXR [**2136-3-28**]: There has been further improved aeration in the left lower lobe since the recent chest radiograph of [**2136-3-26**] and more marked improvement when compared to the earlier radiograph of [**3-21**].
Bilateral pleural effusions are present, left greater than right.
Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
No definite thrombosis is noted within the IVC to suggest thrombosis; however, the infrarenal IVC is being pressed by a dilated loop of jejunum, which is unlikely to cause IVC obstruction since there is no collateral formation and no distal dilatation of iliac veins.
New interval development of moderate bilateral pleural effusion and massive ascites  and anasarca suggest volume overload state/heart failure as the cause of lower extemity edema .
Unchanged appearance of mild right hydronephrosis and hydroureter of unknown etiology.
Unchanged appearance of necrotic pancreatic tail mass.
Small hypodense liver lesion within the dome of the liverthat is too small to characterize.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 62 yo F w/ pancreatic cancer on C1D19 Gemcitabine with several weeks of LE swelling.
Following admission, patient underwent work-up for lower extremity edema.
CT of her abdomen and pelvis revealed IVC compression by obstructed afferent loop due to necrotic adenocarcinoma in tail of the pancreas.
Calculated FeNa 0.7 points to effective intravascular volume depletion.
2) Generalized anarsarca:  She developed new pleural effusions, ascites, and generalized anasarca in the post-operative period, likely the result of her hypoalbuminemia.
She also had some intermittent and persitent lower extremity edema post-operatively, likely the result of dependent edema.
Leg edema was complicated by 4 areas of stage II skin breakdown over her distal lower extremities.
Leg edema improved with elevation of her extremities.
3) Thrombocytopenia - Patient's platelets trended down from >500 on admission to 114.
4) Pancreatic insufficiency - Patient is s/p whipple with insulin dependence.
Prior to her surgical intervention, she was found unresponsive with a blood glucose of 11; it is unknown how long she had been hypoglycemic.
She continued to have interval hypoglycemia post-operatively.
5) Pancreatic cancer - Further chemotherapy deferred until completion of wound healing and pending further discussion with her Oncologist.
7) Prophylaxis - Patient with hypercoagulable state with underlying malignancy.
Given her minimal subcutaneous tissue for medication administration, she was maintained on Lovenox at prophylaxis dosing.
Lovenox was temporarily held with concern for HIT but was resumed prior to discharge.
8) FEN - Patient is chronically malnourished.
She also has 4 small areas of skin breakdown over distal lower extremities, secondary to profound edema.
Advise pressure relief and good skin moisturization.
Hydromorphone 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for breakthrough pain.
