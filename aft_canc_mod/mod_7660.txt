Right lower lobe opacities are likely atelectasis are unchanged.
There is mild pulmonary edema.
There is no pneumothorax.
Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
[**1-27**] TTE: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
There are nonmobile complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is evidence of an echolucent space posterior to the aortic valve bioprosthesis with diffuse thickening around the aortic root.
These findings were already present on post-op TEE dated [**2173-1-16**], although less prominent and are most likely c/w post-op changes.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of valvular vegetations or abscesses.
She arrived to the unit with an open chest due to bleeding.
Post op she was hypertensive and slow to wake.
She developed postoperative renal failure with creatinine to 4.5, but recovered and her creatinine fell to normal levels.
She awoke slowly and once awake she was very anxious and confused which continued her whole hospital course.
Precedex was initially used to treat her anxiety, she has a significant pre-op history of anxiety and depression and was on Ativan and Elavil.
This worked for a period but her mental status was still an issue and gerontology was consulted who recommeded starting low dose Seroquel combined with Ativan.
She was very difficult to wean from the ventilator and she self extubated on POD #4 but was reintubated a few hours later due to respiratory distress and hypoxia.
Her BAL grew out Serratia and Proteus and she was placed on Vancomycin/Cefepime/Zosyn.
She was found to have significant glottal edema and thick secretions.
She failed several of her speech and swallow exams and therefore tube feeds were continued.
She was noted to have elevated amylase/lipase but was asymptomatic and they eventually returned to baseline.
She also had episodes of PAF and was started on amiodarone and Coumadin.
She was diuresed to below her pre-op weight and was started on free water bolusues for hypernatremia which has resolved.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complications.
She was seen by ENT again for f/u examination and while her glottal edema had resolved she was noted to have a concerning amount of dessicated secrections on her vocal cords and was at a very high risk of obstructing her airway.
However, prior to transferring the patient developed acute respiratory distress and decreased breath sounds on left side.
