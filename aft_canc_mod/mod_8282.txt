On Thurs [**3-21**] she had an episode of vision loss that she describes as being in both eyes where she lost the right lower vision quadrant for approximately 15 minutes.
SHe has no residual vision changes.
She denies nausea and vomiting.
No loss of bowel or bladder.
Past Medical History: HTN, seasonal allergies, childhood asthma   Social History: lives in [**Hospital1 3494**]   Family History: father with hx aneurysm, mother with breast CA ROS: no fevers, chills sweats, unexpected weight loss or gain   Physical Exam: Gen: WD/WN, comfortable, NAD.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Reflexes: B T Br Pa Ac Right     2+2+2+ 2+ 2+ Left      2+2+2+ 2+ 2+  Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements, bilat  Handedness Right   Pertinent Results: [**3-24**]: MRI Brain with and without contrast: large left frontal mass with areas of old hemorrhage.
Unremarkable CT torso with no evidence of primary malignancy.
No large arterial feeding vessel from either the ipsilateral ICA or ECA.
There is thinning of the overlying left frontal bone, without definite erosion.
Medial deviation of the cortical veins, with a single dilated cortical vein traversing the anterior aspect of the left temporal lobe, coursing adjacent to the mass.
Large heterogeneously enhancing extra-axial mass in the left frontal and Preliminary Reporttemporal regions with mass effect and midline shift of 8 mm to the right.
[**3-28**] MRI Brain- IMPRESSION: Unchanged heterogeneously enhancing extra-axial mass in the left frontal and temporal regions causing mass effect on the underlying brain parenchyma with a midline shift of 8 mm towards the right side.
Limited study was done for preoperative localization.
[**3-29**] MRI Brain - There are expected post-surgical changes from the recent left frontal craniotomy with a thin extra-axial fluid collection along the left frontal convexity.
There has been interval decrease in mass effect, with decrease in rightward shift of midline structures to 5 mm, as compared to 7 mm on the CT head from one day prior.
There are areas of T1-hyperintensity with corresponding susceptibility abnormality on the gradient echo sequences in the surgical cavity in the left frontal region consistent with blood products.
On the post-contrast images, there is expected post-operative mild dural thickening and enhancement in the left frontal and temporal regions.
However, there is a small focus of abnormal enhancement, seen immediately adjacent to the greater [**Doctor First Name 362**] of the left sphenoid bone (10:[**11-14**] and 901b:56-58) which, when compared to the previous MRI study from the outside hospital, and given the close relationship to bone, is concerning for residual tumor.
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarction.
There is no hydrocephalus.
Visualized orbits, paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are unremarkable.
Status post recent left frontal craniotomy and resection of the large left frontal extra-axial mass, with blood products in the left frontal surgical cavity, along with dural thickening and enhancement in the left frontal and temporal regions, expected post-operative changes.
Focus of abnormal enhancement, immediately adjacent to the greater [**Doctor First Name 362**] of left sphenoid bone, concerning for residual tumor.
No other acute intracranial abnormality.
Brief Hospital Course: 38 y/o F with 3 weeks of intermittent headaches and bilteral R outer quadrant visual loss x1 presents with a large L frontal mass seen.
She was placed on keppra and pain medication.
Surgery was without complication and she tolerated it well.
Post operative head CT revealed post operative changes, no hemorrhage.
On [**3-29**] she was neurologically intact and pain was well controlled.
Disp:*40 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: L frontal lesion   Discharge Condition: Stable A&Ox3 Independent ambulation   Discharge Instructions: ??????
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound was closed with staples or non-dissolvable sutures then you must wait until after they are removed to wash your hair.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**6-11**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and/or a wound check.
