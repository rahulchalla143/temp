MRI showed an expansile 4 x 2.2 x 3.0 cm enhancing mass centered in the diploic space at the left frontal bone marginated by frontal suture posteriorly with thinning and depression inner table.
The patient herself noticed a bump, some achiness in this area, but otherwise no other higher function, cranial nerves, sensory, motor, or neurological dysfunction.

No enhancing lesions within the brain.
[**9-1**] CT head: The patient is post left frontal craniectomy and resection of a large calvarial-based mass, seen on the preoperative [**2151-9-1**] MR examination.
There is mild pneumocephalus (2:12).
A cranial plate overlies the resection site.
No large hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect is seen.
Expected post-surgical appearance of left frontal craniectomy and resection of the left calvarial mass.

Persistent left frontal dural enhancement, also seen in the pre-operative study.
No acute infarcts.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 3708**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for resection of left calvarial mass and cranioplasty.
She was given stress dose steroids prior to case for adrenal insufficiency.
She had hypokalemia intra-op due to her adrenal insufficiency but this corrected to 3.1.
Postop Head CT demonstrated no hemorrhage.
On [**9-3**] the patient was noted to be delerious, not oriented to the month or specific hospital.
She was afebrile, urinalysis was negative for infection and possibly delerium inducing medications were stopped.
BMP did reveal significant abnormalities including hypokelemia, hypophosphotemia and low magnesium.
A geriatric consult was called and they felt that the electrolyte abnormalities were most likely responsible for the delerium.
