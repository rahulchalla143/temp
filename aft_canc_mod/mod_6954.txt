Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for fever and difficulty breathing.
An interventional procedure called a bronchoscopy was performed to get samples to determine if you had an infection in your lungs.
After this procedure, you developed flash pulmonary edema which is when fluid rapidly accumulates in the lungs, and were admitted to the ICU for difficulty breathing.
You were given medicine to remove some of the fluid from your lungs, steroids and antibiotics.
Please go immediately to the emergency room if you should experience fevers, difficulty breathing, chest pain, shortness of breath or any other symptoms that are concerning to you.
