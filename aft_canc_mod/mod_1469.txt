Admission Date:  [**2130-1-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-1-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2052-7-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Antihistamines  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 19193**] Chief Complaint: elevated BGs, and chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central Line Placement   History of Present Illness: 77 yoM with CLL, DM type I with insulin pump, HTN, afib who p/w SOB, R sided pleuritic chest and shoulder pain, and elevated BGs.
He was seen by his outpatient Oncologist just after [**Holiday 1451**] and had bloodwork performed which showed an elevated WBC count.
He spent much of the flight on his feet due to chronic pain in his knees.
He fell into [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] but this was a witnessed fall and had no head trauma or LOC.
This am, patient called his son at 8 am stating that he was aching all over and felt SOB w/ pleuritic R sided chest and shoulder pain.
He was found to have elevated leukocytosis compared to prior values in our system.
CXR showed e/o RLL pna w/ a R sided effusion.
EKG with ST depressions in inferior and lat leads, worse than prior.
He received 1 SL NTG which had no effect on chest pain but led to hypotension w/ SBP to 70s.
Around the same time, he developed severe abdominal pain.
He complained of [**11-16**] epigastric abdominal pain and reportedly had a distended, firm abdomen.
He received 1 percocet, 2 mg of morphine, and 2 mg of dilaudid with improved abdominal and chest pain but worse mental status.
He received a abdominal XR and an abdominal CT without contrast which showed no acute abnormalities.
His abdomen once again was soft and his abdominal pain did not return.
Family History: Mother died of MI in 90s.
No conjunctival pallor.
No thyromegaly.
No murmurs LUNGS: Diffuse insp and exp wheezes.
Bibasilar crackles, R>L w/ decreased BS at bases bilat, R>L ABD: Decreased BS.
Scars over bilateral shoulders SKIN: No rashes or ecchymoses NEURO: Restless.
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2130-1-18**]):    NO GROWTH.
Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2130-1-18**]):       NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
IMAGING: [**2130-1-17**] CXR IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe pneumonia with likely small right parapneumonic effusion.
No acute intra-abdominal process to explain the patient's pain.
Severe splenomegaly and marked lymphadenopathy, predominantly in the mesenteric nodal station.
No evidence of splenic rupture.
Lack of IV contrast limits evaluation for splenic infarcts.
Extensive right lower lobe pneumonia and a smaller consolidation in the left lower lobe, which may represent an additional focus of infection.
Moderate left hydronephrosis of uncertain etiology, but possibly due to congenital UPJ obstruction.
Gradual increase  in right pleural effusion in a patient with right lower lobe consolidation.
Increased vascular engorgement which may be related to volume overload/mild congestive heart failure.
Non-specific low amplitude T waves in leads I, II, aVF with non-specific ST segment depressions in leads V5-V6.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
[**2130-1-18**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**2-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild to moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 77 yoM with CLL, DM type I with insulin pump, HTN, afib who p/w SOB and pleuritic CP found to have elevated WBC count, RLL pna, hypoxia, and hypotension now being called out of MICU on Levo for PNA and BP stable .
# RLL PNA: Initally, the patient met SIRS criteria with RLL PNA on CXR.
Found to have s.pneumo bacteremia in [**5-11**] bottles, and was started on Levofloxacin.
His mental status was initially deteriorated due to his sepsis, but prior to discharge had signficantly improved with medical therapy.
He was afebrile and able to ambulate without difficulty.
# Hypoxia: The patient initially hypoxic at presentation likely due to his PNA.
# Acidosis: Initially, the patient had AG acidosis, likely secondary to lactate.
It then became non gap in setting of IVF and renal failure.
# chest pain: Initially, the CP was pleuritic and radiating to R shoulder.
It was likely secondary to pneumonia and diaphragmatic irritation.
He had worsened ST depressions on ECG but <1 mm.
Per discussions w/ Heme/Onc and transfusion medicine, leukostasis causing hyperviscosity extremely unlikely and there was no need to plasmapherese.
As above, Heme/Onc and Transfusion medicine not concerned about leukostasis and no need for plasmaphoresis.
His platelets remained low, but stable, and he did not have any active bleeding.
This was likely secondary to hypotension given concern for sepsis.
It was likely elevated secondary to oral anticoagulation and sepsis.
This was likely in setting of infection.
# HTN: now normotensive - cont metoprolol for now - will review patient's medications in AM to ensure he is on all proper medications .
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Pneumonia Sepsis Secondary Diagnosis: Diabetes Mellitus Type 1 Atrial Fibrillation Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Good, afebrile, breathing room air   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for high blood sugers and a pneumonia.
You were initially in the ICU due to low blood pressures and high blood sugars.
If you develop any of the following concerning symptoms, please call your PCP or go to the ED: shortness of breath, chest pains, fevers, elevated/uncontrolled blood sugars, headaches, altered mental status, or abdominal pain.
