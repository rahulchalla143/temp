She stated  that she woke up at 2am on the day of presentation with severe pain.
The pain felt "like gas" and was in the distribution of "a circle" around lower abdomen and lower back.
She also had pain in the epigastrium radiating around to the back and between the shoulder blades.
The pain was [**9-8**], nothing made it better.
Reported having dark brown colored urine on the day before presentation.
In addition to her abdominal symptoms she reported a "soreness" between her breasts just above the incision line.
She had had this pain in the past and prior to the surgery.
She stated that she usually had this pain with exertion and it resolved with rest.
CXR did not show an effusion or consolidation.
CTA ruled out PE, and CT abdomen/pelvis did not demonstrate an acute process.
There was moderate intrahepatic biliary dilation increased from prior studies, but biliary stent position was unchanged.
She was empirically started on Vancomycin/Zosyn given concern for ascending cholangitis in the setting of leukocytosis and elevated LFTs.
On arrival to the ICU she reported no pain in her abdomen but continued chest "soreness."
ROS: (+) Per HPI (-) Denied fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denied headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied cough, shortness of breath.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.

Physical Exam: Admission Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 99.9 BP:122/65 P: 77 RR:22 SpO2:  100% on 2L NC General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MM dry, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: well healing, non erythematous incision across abdomen along epigastrium, soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: foley in place, urine is yellow Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema  Discharge Physical Exam: All vital signs stable and within normal limits, compared to presentation RR has normalized and patient no longer requiring oxygen supplementation.
Exam notable for very mild epigastric tenderness without guarding or rebound.
Chest Radiograph [**2166-7-5**]: IMPRESSION: Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
Moderate atherosclerotic disease.
Bibasilar atelectasis, but no focal airspace consolidations.
Borderline enlarged mediastinal lymph node.
Interval increase in now moderate degree of intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Trace amount of perihepatic and perisplenic fluid.
Known hypoenhancing pancreatic head mass compatible with adenocarcinoma incompletely assessed in this single-phase study, but grossly similar to the CTA abdomen study one month ago.
No intra- or retro-peritoneal hemorrhage.
No intra-abdominal abscess.
ERCP [**2166-7-6**]: Impression: 	      Plastic stent removed     3 cm long distal Biliary stricture noted     Large amount of pus/debris noted     Metal stent inserted as above   .
Brief Hospital Course: 71 year old female with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma presenting with cholangitis, likely due to displacement of previous biliary stent, complicated by sepsis and GNR bacteremia with marked improvement with replacement of biliary stent and antibiotic therapy.
1) Cholangitis c/b gram negative bacteremia:  The patient presented with abdominal pain and an elevated bilirubin with no other obvious source of infection and discovery of displaced stent and pururlent material from her biliary tree.
This is all consistent with acute cholangitis.
Likely inciting event was displacement of previously placed stent.
Of note, the patient did have a significant leukocytosis that remained after her procedure but given her overall improvement and the disappearance of bands this was thought likely due to leukemoid reaction.
2) Sepsis:  She presented with septic shock due to cholangitis and gram negative bacteremia but pressures normalized with fluids and antibiotics.
3) Hypoxic respiratory distress:  Pt desatted in the ED but rapidly improved and CT chest without PE or pulmonary process.
Likely due to splinting and decreased lung volumes.
4) Atypical chest pain: The patient presented with atypical chest pain but had unchanged, normal ECG and normal cardiac enzymes *2.
Her pain resolved with abdominal pain and was thought to be radiation of cholangitis pain.
6) Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma: Unfortunately, the patient was discovered to have metastatic disease and not be a surgical candidate in the midst of her Whipple.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with abdominal pain that we think was due to an infection of your bile ducts.
Followup Instructions: You should schedule a follow up with your PCP toward the end of this week or beginning of next week to have your white blood cell count rechecked and make sure you are doing well before any trip.
