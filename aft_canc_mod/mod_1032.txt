There is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with diffuse pulmonary [**Date Range 1106**] congestion.
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia .
#[**2182-10-17**] SUPINE AND LEFT LATERAL DECUBITUS VIEWS OF THE ABDOMEN: A non-obstructive bowel gas pattern is demonstrated.
No free intraperitoneal air or dilated loops of small bowel are seen.
There is no pneumatosis.
Small-to-moderate amount of fecal material is seen throughout the colon.
There are diffuse [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] calcifications with phleboliths noted in the pelvis.
Multilevel degenerative changes are visualized within the imaged thoracolumbar spine.
IMPRESSION: Non-obstructive bowel gas pattern without evidence for free intraperitoneal air.
There are low lung volumes.
This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely mild.
There is mild pulmonary [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] congestion.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
No focal consolidation is visualized.
There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
IMPRESSION: Pulmonary [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] congestion and low lung volumes.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed with probable inferior hypokinesis (LVEF= 45-50%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Renal US: Normal waveforms of the renal arteries bilaterally without evidence of renal artery stenosis.
Normal-appearing kidneys except for a nonobstructive right renal calculus.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 656**] is a 88yo Russian-speaking man with a h/o CAD s/p quadruple bypass in [**2169**], IDDM, CRI, HTN, Afib A-paced, initially admitted for hypertensive urgency with the subsequent development of DKA, now with elevated troponin levels and minimal EKG changes from baseline without any chest pain.
This is concerning for a myocardial infarction most likely NSTEMI due to increased demand in setting of acute stress.
Upon initial arrival to the medicine floor, pt's SBP > 200 and patient complained of chest pressure/discomfort and so trigger was called.
EKG showed no changes, and CE pnd.
Patient was asymptomatic s/p hydralazine.
In the AM before transfer to the MICU, the patient was found to have increased cardiac enzymes.
Patient was asymptomatic and EKG showed no acute changes.
He had an increase in lactic acidosis to in the 2 - 3 range.
ABG showed metabolic acidosis c/w DKA.
Patient was started on q1hr finger sticks with prn IV insulin, but with little effect as gap only closed to 20 and so it was determined that transfer to MICU for insulin drip management was prudent.
CXR showed increased pulmonary congetion but no source of infection.
Cardiology consulted and agreed with NSTEMI and asked for Stat TTE which showed no gross abnormalities.
# Elevated troponins: Likely type 2 MI (demand ischemia) vs NSTEMI.
Cardiology consult suspected that the likely course of events was hypertensive urgency -> demand ischemia -> DKA.
Given that cardiac biomarkers still trending upward (Tn peaked 1.04, CK-MB peaked at 23), we proceeded with medically managing for NSTEMI vs Type 2 MI at this time: ASA 325mg daily, metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **], atorvastatin 80mg daily, heparin gtt (given for 48hrs) and discharged on plavix 75 daily.
Cardiac catheterization was not performed as it was thought this was more likely demand ischemic (type 2 MI) in setting of hypertensive urgency.
# DKA/DM: Gap closed after fluid administration prior to admission to MICU.
# Hypertensive urgency/HTN: SBPs currently still elevated.
Workup for right adrenal mass was deferred as outpatient.
Was likely prerenal in setting of vomiting and NSTEMI.
CHRONIC ISSUES: .
# Diabetic retinopathy: continued xalatan (home [**Year (4 digits) **] not on formulary) and cosopt eye drops.
# Right adrenal mass.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: -Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction -Hypertensive urgency -Diabetic ketoacidosis  Secondary diagnoses: - Insulin-dependent diabetes - Renal insufficiency - Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted because you were having nausea and vomiting.
You were found to have high blood pressure and high blood sugar from your diabetes, and you were treated in the intensive care unit.
You were also found to have a type of heart attack (non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction) based on your blood tests.
