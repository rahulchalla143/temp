Admission Date:  [**2113-11-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2113-12-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2039-11-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Adhesive Tape / Percocet  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**] Chief Complaint: S/p esophageal stent placment admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD with esophageal stent placement  History of Present Illness: This is a 74 year old female with recently diagnosed gastric CA, s/p resection transfered from [**Hospital3 **] on [**2113-11-24**] to the [**Hospital1 18**] for esophageal stenting.
She was found to have a gastric mass, poorly differentiated adenocarinoma.
EGD was done showing some clots in the stomach but no active bleeding.
She [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] repeat endoscopy which showed a small separtion in one portion of the esophagastric anatomosis with oozing.
She then [**Month/Day (4) 1834**] an arteriogram showing a 6mm splnic pseudoaneurysm.
There was a question of vomiting enroute.
She was then reintubated on [**11-18**] for respiratory distress and hypotension on [**11-18**].
On [**11-20**], she [**Month/Day (4) 1834**] CT chest, which only showed moderate pleural effusions.
Gastrografin swallow on [**2113-11-23**] showed a contained anastomotic leak to the left of the remaining stomach measuring approx 6x3cm.
She was then transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for esophagastric stenting.
She then developed respiratory distress with respiratory rates in 40's, no documented hypoxia.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was aggressively diuresed with furosemide because of flash pulmonary edema.
An echocardiogram performed revealed an EF 40%, severe diastolic dysfunction, moderate mitral regurgitation, akinesis of the septum and hypokinesis of the inferior wall which could suggest recent MI.
Past Medical History: Gastric CA s/p resection Breast ca s/p mastectomy Partial thyroidectomy for thyroid CA Bladder CA s/p transurethral resection HTN Splenic artery aneurysm s/p stenting  Social History: Married and lives with her husband, children live nearby, she is a former smoker of less than one pack per day, she drinks wine occasionally.

MODERATE GROWTH.
MODERATE GROWTH STRAIN 2.
Extraluminal gas collection to the left of the body of the somach, NG tubes through an area of surgical clips in the GE junction into this extraluminal gas collection, findings compatible with perforation at the GE junction 2.
Retroperitoneal hematoma in the right anterio pararenal space  3.
J-tube in place  Bilateral LENI's [**11-20**]: No DVT above the knees  Abdominal Flouroscopy [**2113-11-24**]: A metal stent is visualized projecting over the GEJ, extending from the T9 vertebral body to the L1 vertebral body.
There is dense material in the T9 vertebral body likely secondary to prior vertebroplasty.
There is a small left pleural effusion and retrocardiac opacity.
CT Chest [**11-20**]: no PE, bilateral moderal pleural effusion L>R  CXR (Portable AP) [**2113-11-24**]: New esophageal stent.
Mild pulmonary edema, left lower lobe atelectasis.
There is a tortuous thoracic aorta and some mild cardiomegaly.
There is a unchanged left retrocardiac opacity and bilateral pleural effusions.
There is mild fluid overload as evident by mild pulmonary interstitial marking prominence.
q waves in III, AVF, no ST elevations or depressions EKG [**Hospital1 18**]: TWI in V2-V6  ECHO [**11-27**]: IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease.
Severe diastolic dysfunction.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
[**2113-11-28**] GI Bleeding Study: Brisk bleeding in the left upper quadrant with spread of activity consistent with the know retroperitoneal location.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 83545**] is a 74 year-old lady with recently diagnosed gastric adenocarcinoma, s/p [**2-14**] gastric resection who was transfered from [**Hospital3 **] for esophageal stenting, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after intubation for respiratory distress from pulmonary edema, with a hospital course complicated by pulseless VTach/Vfib arrest while on the floor and massive splenic hemorrhage requiring splenic artery embolization.
Due to prolonged ICU course, her problems are addressed chronologically in detail below:  [**Hospital Unit Name 13533**] [**Date range (3) 83546**]:  Ms. [**Known lastname 83545**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] EGD which showed a large defect at the esophagogastric anastamosis.
She was extubated after the procedure but developed respiratory distress in the PACU, requiring reintubation which was felt to be secondary to pulmonary edema.
The patient [**Date Range 1834**] transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2113-11-27**] to evaluate why she developed pulmonary edema.
TTE showed Moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease.
Severe diastolic dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation.
Hypokinesis and akinesis seen on Echocardiogram suggested recent MI.
Shortly thereafter, she became unresponsive in bed.
She initially had a pulse but quickly lost it.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia with premature beats and stable TWIs in the anterior precodial leads.
Access was obtained, she became hypotensive and hematocrit steadily dropped from 33.5-> 24.1->19.8 so she was transfused 5 units pRBCs, 1 unit FFP, 1 bag platelets repeat HCT 33.
CT Abdomen revealed large hematoma of spleen.
Tagged RBC scan was done showing active bleed of the spleen.
She was given multiple additional units of blood, 1 unit of platelets and taken to interventional radiology for splenic artery embolization.
Broad spectrum antibiotics were initiated and patient was pan-cultured as she started to spike fevers on and off during this time.
She was aggressively diuresed initially, for goal TBB -1.0 to -1.5 L but lasix drip was stopped in the setting of hypotension and increasing creatinine.
Due to increasing leukocytosis and fevers, she was pan-cultured again.
Repeat CT abdomen and pelvis revealed a large left-sided pleural effusion with collapse of the left lower lobe, small right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis, stable  splenic JP drain and infrasplenic fluid collection/hematoma, percutaneous J-tube without evidence of intestinal obstruction and no definitive abscesses.
Due to no identifiable source of infection in the setting of leukocytosis and fever, interventional pulmonology was called to perform thoracentesis of pleural effusion to rule out empyema.
600cc of serosanguinous turbid fluid was drained but was negative for microorganisms and cytology revealed no malignant cells.
Her abdomen continued to be rigid and bilious fluid was emerging from her J-tube site.
Additonally, she started having bilious emesis.
After speaking with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 64258**], her surgeon from [**Hospital3 2783**], a possible source of infection could be splenic necrosis from inadequate blood supply as splenic artery was embolized and patient did not have adequate collateral supply due to alterations of her vasculature from gastric resection.
[**Hospital1 18**] surgical team, [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] attending spoke with patient's family regarding goals of care and splenectomy was not an option given patient was a poor surgical candidate.
