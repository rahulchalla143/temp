FINDINGS: Again note is made of central venous catheter terminating at the junction of SVC and right atrium.
Note is made of bibasilar opacity associated with effusion, probably representing atelectasis; however, pneumonia, pneumonia cannot be excluded.

Upon Discharge/Interval Data: WBC 6.9 Hb 11.6 Hct 31.6 Plts  92 Ca: 7.9 Mg: 1.7 P: 3.0   Brief Hospital Course: Dr. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 yo gentleman with critical aortic stenosis, chronic renal failure admitted with mental status changes in the setting of uremia and hypertensive emergency.
CT head showed a bleed in the basal ganglia.
The patient was admitted to the ICU for close BP monitoring and electrolyte monitoring in the setting of uremic metabolic acidosis and intracranial hemorrhage.
Renal was consulted, patient was started on HD with HD catheter placed by IR, DDAVP was given for uremic coagulopathy, and bicarb drip started for acidosis.
Patient was started on Levofloxacin for concern of PNA on CXR.
In addition, Cardiology was consulted for troponin leak, thought to be [**3-5**] to demand ischemia, treated with beta blocker, Statin.
Repeat echo showed no significant change from prior.
Improving gradually, patient having coherent conversation with Daughter, more easily arousable, answers questions appropriately.
Patient continued to have transiently elevated blood pressures prior to hemodialysis and therefore required ongoing dialysis for fluid management.
Repeat CXR on [**2201-1-6**] showed partial resolution of PNA and therefore the patient was continued on Levofloxacin to complete a 10 days course.
In terms of other work up for the patient's altered mental status, B12 and TSH were measured which showed elevated B12 and TSH/T4 wnl.
Patient oozing from line sites and ear (basal cell CA on right ear) likely secondary to uremic coagulopathy.
His Hct is currently stable at 31.6 and there is minimal oozing from line sites.
Patient also noted to have an elevated PTT to a max of 150 thought to be potentially secondary to heparin given with hemodialysis.
Patient was not given any heparin products on the floor given his bleeding tendency.
Patient also maintained a stable Hct with decreased oozing from his line.
Of not a DIC workup was negative and there was no evidence of hemolysis.
Elevated BP on admission, likely lead to intracranial bleeding.
Initially required IV Hydralazine, Lopressor IV and Labetalol gtt with poor control.
HD required for fluid management and BP control.
Patient's daughter gives history of long standing hypertension >200 at times without seeking medical attention.
Patient is currently off ALL antihypertensive meds which should be avoided given his severe aortic stenosis.
Patient having elevated BP prior to HD up to 180s, otherwise well controlled to 120-130s after dialysis, now stable at 140-150s.
Renal Failure.
Patient with worsening renal failure over several months, now presenting with uremic symptoms, started on hemodialysis during this admission with improvement in blood pressure and Bun/Cr.
His blood pressures have been controlled with HD since patient has tight aortic stenosis (as above).
Right basal ganglia intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Found on CT head upon admission when patient presented with elevated blood pressure.
CT showed a 5mm area w/ surrounding edema w/o shift or hydrocephalus.
This is a potential cause for his change in mental status although malignant hypertension alone with uremia is a more likely explanation.
Initial chem 7 showed an AG of 22, without compensation.
Uremia being the leading etiology, patient had no evidence of sepsis.
Likely secondary to renal failure.
Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease with normal Iron level.
Of note, patient had trace guaiac positive stool with no history of colonoscopy.
Patient also had ongoing bleeding while in hospital likely secondary to uremic coagulopathy requiring another 2 units of pRBCs.
Questionable retrocardiac opacity on CXR prior to admission, also with history of upper respiratory symptoms that resolved prior to admission.
Patient was started on Levaquin however, given that the patient was very ill on presentation and the underlying cause of his change in mental status was not clear.
Repeat CXR showed partial resolution of this opacity and as such he was continued on this 10 day course of antibiotics.
Patient remains without any symptoms of cough, shortness of breath or sputum production.
Patient noted to have several episodes of transient apnea at night during sleep.
No further episodes after arrival to the regular medical flood.
Likely secondary to intracranial bleed, uremia, toxic metabolic disturbance.
No specific treatment as provided other than treatment of his underlying medical problems.
Patient with hyponatremia Na 128 on admission.
Possibly secondary to intracranial event, also possibly due to dehydration with hypovolemic hyponatremia.
Patient has maintained a normal sodium level for several days without intervention.
Initial concern for demand ischemia in setting of hypertensive emergency.
Repeat EKGs showed no change.
ASA was held in setting of bleeding which can be restarted as needed after evaluation by his PCP.
History of aortic aneurysmal dilation of ascending aorta.
No active issues during this admission.
Patient without symptoms of dissection, denied CP, SOB, dizziness, lightheadedness.
Basal cell carcinoma right ear.
Patient had appointment as outpatient with dermatology surgery.
Left cranial nerve VI palsy.
