Patient presented to [**Hospital3 8544**] the afternoon of admission with chest pain, onset around noon and radiation to neck and left arm.
Pain occurred at rest and was worse with inspiration.
Associated with SOB, no nausea or vomiting.
Of note, reported some pleuritic symptoms several days prior to this episode, though not as intense.
Presented to OSH where EKGs were remarkable for STE and small q waves in II, III, aVF with reciprocal ST depressions in I and aVL.
He was given nitro x 3 without relief of his symptoms and subsequently started on a nitro drip.
Cardiac catheterization showed a right dominant system with total occlusion of RCA, minimal disease in the remaining vessels.
The lesion was apparently difficult to cross and behaved more like a chronic TO than an acute lesion.
In the CCU, patient reported pain improved, but continued pleuritic pain in his upper chest/neck with inspiration and burping.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: + Diabetes, + Dyslipidemia, + Hypertension 2.
CARDIAC HISTORY: CAD s/p PCI in [**2167**] 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Metastatic Pancreatic cancer (currently on gemcitabine qOweek and erlotinib daily) Embolic cerebral infarcts Status post left MCA stroke with left carotid artery stenosis S/p upper and lower GI bleed [**12-15**] Thrombocytopenia Diabetic retinopathy Cataracts Glaucoma  Social History: - Tobacco:  currently smokes 1ppd x 40 years - EtOH:  previously was a heavy drinker, quit 20 years ago.
Family History: The patient's father died of asbestosis and mesothelioma at 75 years.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi anteriorly.
No HSM or tenderness.

Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed 1 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LM, LAD and LCx had minimal disease.
Bare metal stents placed in a patient with presumed STEMI with ST elevation in 3 and F. 2.
He is still c/o of pleuritic chest pain.
A spiral CT must be obtained to r/o PE as this may have been a chronic TO.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral akinesis, c/w RCA disease.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with focal basal free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Dilated and hypokinetic RV in a pattern, consistent with either proximal RCA disease or acute pulmonary hypertension (e.g., PE).
Normal estimated pulmonary pressures argue in favor of CAD as a cause of RV dysfunction.
CTA Chest: The pulmonary arterial tree is well opacified and there is no embolic filling defect.
The aorta is normal in caliber, and there is no evidence of dissection.
Note is made of small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying subsegmental atelectasis.
In addition, there is more focal consolidation in the left lower lobe (4:67) with the possibility of pneumonia not excluded.
The heart and great vessels are notable for extensive coronary arterial calcification as well as coronary arterial stenting.
Though there is no hilar, mediastinal or axillary lymphadenopathy by size criteria, note is made of many borderline sized hilar nodes as well as multiple mediastinal nodes, notable in number.
The study is not tailored for precise characterization of subdiaphragmatic contents.
Nevertheless those included are notable for pneumobilia as well as a metallic common bile duct stent seen on the scout imaging.
Osseous structures reveal no suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesions.
No pulmonary embolism.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis as well as more confluent opacity at the left lung base.
For the latter, the possibility of pneumonia is not excluded and should be correlated to the clinical presentation of the patient.
Extensive coronary arterial calcification .
No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Small pneumobilia in the CBD, likely introduced by the known biliary stent.
Extensive metastatic disease in the liver, better assessed by the prior CT torso on [**2174-2-21**].
Cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 88506**] is a 66 year old M w/ h/o pancreatic CA s/p sphincterotomy [**12-15**] and chemotherapy with gemcitabine and erlotinib, DM type 2, and CAD s/p MI and PCI/stent [**2167**] who was transferred from OSH with acute inferior STEMI.
# STEMI: Patient presented with chest pain to OSH that was severe and sharp in quality and acute in onset at rest.
EKG consistent with inferior MI.
Total occlusion of RCA on cath, but some suggestion of chronic state.
Given findings on cath and history of intermittent pleuritic pain prior to today's episode cannot be entirely sure about the timing of the MI.
No statin was given history of rhabdomyolysis.
No pericardial effusion, small pleural effusions noted.
He does have a friction rub noted on exam that persisted.
# Acute Systolic Dysfunction: As of [**2174-2-5**], intact EF with no evidence of systolic or diastolic dysfunction.
ECHO after MI showed EF of 40%, no pericardial effusion.
Pt did not have symptoms of CHF during his hospital stay but teaching regarding daily weights, low Na diet and adherance to medicines done at discharge.
ACEi was started as an inpatient and should be uptitrated if BP tolerate.
# RHYTHM: Currently in sinus.

No arrythmias noted on telemetry during hospital stay.
# Pancreatic CA: Followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1852**].
# Hypertension: Currently normotensive.
No hypotensive episodes at OSH or in hospital.
# Diabetes mellitus: On metformin and glipizide at home.
No medication changes were made.
# Bacteremia: Pt developed fevers and found to have Klebsiella in his blood cultures.
ID was consulted given pts history of pancreatic CA and recommended a 12 day course of IV Ceftriaxone.
The source of bacteremia is unclear with no evidence of secondary infection via CT or ultrasound testing.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 88506**],  You were admitted to the hospital because you had a heart attack.
You were found to have bacteria in your blood and you were seen by the infectious disease team and started on an antibiotic called ceftriaxone.
As of this time, we do not know why you developed this infection in your blood.
Start Ceftriaxone intravenously for 2 weeks to treat the bacteria in your blood 5.
