Admission Date:  [**2184-9-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2184-10-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2115-11-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: Weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: NA  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 28253**] is a very pleasant 68 year old man with past medical history significant for stage III, squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, he is status post radiation with IMRT and six weeks of Erbitux in [**2184-5-31**].
He has a G-tube in place for progressive dysphagia.
He now presents with weakness, difficulty ambulating, and dehydration.
Past Medical History: Hypertension CVA- "small strokes," Exploratory laparatomy about 20 yrs ago for incarcerated hernia   Social History: Previous gas station maintenance worker, 40 pack-yr history of smoking and current smoker, drank 2-3 beers a day before the dysphagia started.
HEART: Regular without murmurs.
INDICATION:68 year old male with history of stage III squamous cell carcinoma presenting as a right oropharyngeal mass.
HEAD/NECK: The right oropharyngeal mass extending from the hypophyarynx to the cricoid cartilage seen in the PET/CT dated [**2184-4-29**] is seen again.
The FDG-avidity of the mass has decreased since the last scan.
The mass continues to extend past the midline to the left.
The left level IIb node seen on the prior study is no longer seen and there is no new nodal involvement.
There is low level FDG-avidity of the muscles and soft tissue in the posterior part of the neck and also in the base of the neck which is most likely secondary to radiation therapy (Images 57-62).
There is no abnormal FDG-avid focus in the head.
CHEST: There is no FDG-avid mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy.
The right upper lobe nodule described in the last PET/CT is stable.
There is a new ground glass opacity in the periphery of the right upper lobe and may be secondary to infection, follow up is recommended (Image 73).
The 2 mm right middle lobe nodule is stable(Image 80).
The left lower lobe opacity is seen again and continues to be non-FDG-avid.
ABDOMEN/PELVIS: There is no abnormal hepatic, splenic or adrenal gland FDG uptake.
There is no FDG-avid abdominopelvic lymphadenopathy.
There is physiologic tracer accumulation in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary  tracts.
The focal FDG-avid lesion in the redundant sigmoid colon is not seen today.
The FDG-avidity seen in the left scrotum has also resolved.The focal FDG uptake in the right upper quadrant is also not seen today.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:There are non-FDG-avid degenerative changes in the thoracolumbar spine.
There is no FDG-avid or destructive bone lesion.
The focal FDG-avid lesion described in the iliopsoas tendon anterior to the neck of the left femur has resolved though the hypodense CT correlate is persistent further reinforcing an infective etiology.
Physiologic uptake is seen in the brain, myocardium, salivary glands, GI and GU tracts, liver and spleen.
Interval decrease in FDG-avidity of the right oropharyngeal mass.
No new FDG-avid lymphadenopathy.
Resolution of the focal FDG-avidity in the right lower lobe.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**9-30**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild global biventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Recent tracheostomy.
Poor respiratory status.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-2**], most recently 4:34 p.m.: Volume loss in the left lower lobe has improved, revealing new consolidation, probably pneumonia.
Heart size is normal, pulmonary vasculature is mildly engorged, but there is no pulmonary edema.
No mediastinal widening or pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course:  [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course: 68 yo M with PMH of stage III squamous cell throat CA admitted for weakness and dehydration.
# Hypoxia and respiratory failure, secondary to pneumonia: He was originally admitted to the oncology service and there became hypoxic.
Patient was transferred to ICU on [**9-16**] for hypoxia and respiratory distress.
This respiratory distress was most likely from right middle lobe PNA seen on CXR, although he did have a high BNP and heart failure may have contributed acutely.
MSSA grew out of his sputum on a sample from [**9-18**].
As the admission continued, and other etiologies appeared less likely (i.e., PE, CHF), pneumonia was thought to be the main precipitant of his respiratory failure, in conjunction with patient difficulty in defending his airway because of his distorted throat anatomy; he lacked a gag and had a weak cough.
Mr. [**Known lastname 28253**] was initially double covered for pseudomonas with cefepime and cipro, but later the antibiotics were changed to vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl and levofloxacin for coverage of GPCs in sputum; anaerobes from aspiration; and double coverage for pseudomonas.
On the night of [**9-17**], he became more and more tachypneic and was tiring with increasing work of breathing, and ABG showed worsening hypoxia, so we intubated Mr. [**Known lastname 28253**]; this intubation was somewhat difficult per report of anesthesia, with requirement for fiber optic visualization to successfully complete the intubation.
He was ultimately extubated after some difficulty with cuff leak; after steroids were administered he had a cuff leak and was extubated.
He continued to have difficulty with work of breathing due to copious secretions and likely also due to unusual throat anatomy.
A mechanical insufflator-exsufflator was used frequently to help with secretions because of his difficulty with coughing; this was helpful but he continued to have significant difficulty with secretions.
ENT was consulted and saw thick crusted dry mucus throughout his larynx and coating the area around his vocal cords and trachea.
This was removed by ENT via laryngoscopy and he had a brief clinical improvement with an impressive ease of breathing, but within a day, he again had greatly increased work of breathing with upper airway sounds consistent with high degree of secretions which he appeared unable to clear.
A tortuous and unusual anatomy was appreciated by the ENT service who performed this, assumed to be secondary to his cancer and to radiation and chemotherapy to treat it.
[**9-18**]: levofloxacin and flagyl were started for double coverage of pseudomonas, and increased coverage of anaerobes.
[**10-3**]: With increased sputum, new opacity, leukocytosis and fever, we started vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, flagyl.
# Hyponatremia: His sodium was 119 on admission and on repeat.
Urine lytes were initially potentially consistent with SIADH.
Given the resolution this was unlikely to be related to his oncologic history, and may either have been hypovolemia and renal dysfunction, or transient SIADH associated with his pneumonia.
# Stage III Squamous Cell Throat CA: Mr. [**Known lastname 28253**] is followed as an outpatient, and was seen as an inpatient, by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], of [**Hospital1 18**] oncology.
His need for help with secretions decreased somewhat with trach tube but he does continue to need suctioning.
# Chronic systolic heart failure An echocardiogram was performed on [**9-30**], with results above, showing a mild decrease in systolic heart function from prior.
He had an elevated BNP on arrival, and likely CHF contributed to his hypoxia which was primarily secondary to pneumonia.
Hypertension was treated as below.
# Hypertension: Anti-hypertensives were initially stopped in the setting of his acute illness.
In the hospital this was metoprolol for shorter-acting and more flexible dosing, replacing his home atenolol dose.

Post-radiation laryngeal anatomical changes Secondary: -Stage III throat cancer -Hypertension   Discharge Condition: At the time of discharge patient's tracheostomy had been changed, he was breathing comfortably on trach collar, he had a PICC placed for antibiotic administration, was afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating his tube feeds at goal and considered medically stable for discharge to pulmonary rehab.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for weakness and dehydration; you were soon diagnosed with pneumonia.
Even though your infection resolved, you were still having trouble breathing due to the changes in your throat from the cancer and radiation.
Additionally, on [**2184-10-3**] we found that you had a new pneumonia, in the left lower lobe of your lungs.
Your sputum culture showed that your infection, was with a type of bacteria called MRSA.
Stopped Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily because you had some low sodium levels.
Once discharged, please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you have difficulty breathing, fever or chills, have difficulty coughing or controlling your secretions, trouble swallowing, chest pain or any other concerning symptoms.
