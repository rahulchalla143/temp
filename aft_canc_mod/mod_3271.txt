RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2157-3-2**] 10:16 AM Reason: please eval for interval change [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 61 year old woman with known right lower lung mass s/p right VATS REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please eval for interval change CHEST TWO VIEWS INDICATION: 61-year-old woman with known right lower lung mass status post VATS.
Again note is made of atelectasis of the right middle lobe and right lower lobe associated with right infrahilar mass.
There is associated small right pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax is identified.
IMPRESSION: Continued right middle lobe and right lower lobe atelectasis due to patient's known mass in the right infrahilar region.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2157-2-25**] 11:36 AM CT THORACENTESIS DRAINAGE Reason: please drain; please send pleural fluid for gram stain and c [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 61 year old woman with R effusion REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please drain; please send pleural fluid for gram stain and culture CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
PREPROCEDURE CHEST FINDINGS: Non-contrast images of the thorax demonstrate a large right pleural effusion and right middle lobe atelectasis as seen previously.
Post-procedure images demonstrated no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 10-French pigtail catheter into the right pleural space with aspiration of 15-20 cc of serosanguineous fluid.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report GUIDANCE FOR [**Female First Name (un) **]/ABD/PARA CENTESIS US  [**2157-2-24**] 3:20 PM GUIDANCE FOR [**Female First Name (un) **]/ABD/PARA CE; PLEURAL ASP BY RADIOLOGIST Reason: RT PLEURAL EFFUSION INDICATION: Right-sided pleural effusion.
Under ultrasound guidance, a 19-gauge [**Last Name (un) 11097**] catheter was inserted into a pocket of fluid in the right pleural space without difficulty.
2 to 3 cc of clear serous-appearing fluid was withdrawn.
The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate post-procedure complications.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report [**2157-2-23**] 3:55 PM CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST Reason: evaluate for PE and/or RML consolidation/empyema Contrast: [**Hospital 13288**] [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 61 year old woman with worsening R effusion REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: evaluate for PE and/or RML consolidation/empyema CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
CT OF THE CHEST There is a comparison non-contrast CT from [**2157-1-20**].
CLINICAL HISTORY: Lung cancer status post right lower lobe wedge resection.
Now worsening right pleural effusion.
Evaluate for PE or pneumonia.
No pulmonary embolism as clinically questioned.
Complete atelectasis of the right middle lobe.
There is a moderate right pleural effusion with no evidence of infection on CT. 3.
Abnormal mediastinal and hilar soft tissue.
This may be related to postsurgical changes.
Left breast mass again noted.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2157-2-22**] 7:31 AM REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: 61 year old woman with right lower lobe mass s/p lobectomy s/p bronch INDICATION: Right lower lobe mass, status post lobectomy, status post bronchoscopy.
FINDINGS: Again seen is opacification of the inferior right hemithorax, status post right lower lobe resection.
Unchanged opacity obliterating the right heart border corresponds with persistent collapse of the right middle lobe.
No evidence of pneumothorax or pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: Persistent right middle lobe collapse.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2157-2-18**] 8:03 AM [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 61 year old woman with known right lower lung mass s/p right VATS INDICATION: Known right lower lung mass status post VATS.
FINDINGS: There is persistent collapse of the right middle lobe, with small right-sided pleural effusion.
The aerated portion of the right hemithorax as well as the left hemithorax appears normal without evidence of effusion or pneumothorax.
No osseous abnormalities appreciated.
Based on the results of the recent (postoperative) bronchoscopy, this is presumably due to postobstructive collapse due to secretions.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2157-2-16**] 9:13 AM Reason: effusion, edema [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 61 year old woman with right lower lobe mass s/p lobectomy.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: effusion, edema INDICATION: Right lower lobe mass status post lobectomy.
Right effusion persists.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Persistent right effusion with chest tubes in place.
No pneumothorax.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 61 year old woman with right lower lobe mass now s/p lobectomy POD 0 w/dropping blood pressure REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: evaluate for effusion PORTABLE CHEST OF [**2157-2-13**].
A previously noted small right apical pneumothorax is no longer visualized.
Postoperative volume loss is again demonstrated in the right hemithorax.
The right hemidiaphragm has a change in configuration compared to the earliest postoperative radiograph on [**2157-2-11**], suggesting a component of superimposed subpulmonic pleural fluid in this region.
A unilateral interstitial pattern in the right lung appears increased and may reflect interstitial pulmonary edema.
Subcutaneous emphysema is again seen in the right chest wall.
Pt tolerated procedure fairly well, transferred to PACU extubated, in stable condition, but w/ c/o SOB and pain, chest tube ([**Doctor Last Name **] chest tube) x2 to suction.
Pain issues addressed-dilaudid epidural per APS.
PACU course sig for: hypotension- treated w/ IVF and neo gtt for BP>90; pain w/ MSo4 PCA as epidural capped in setting of hypotension.
Pt transferred to ICU for close hemdynamic and respiratory monitoring.
ICU course([**2157-2-12**] 1100-1/18/06 1600):Chest tube management post-RLLlobectomy; pulmonary toilet, wean pressors; diuresis,electrolyte management, steroid inhalers started; pain control.
Pulmonary consult respiratory assistance in managment of COPD in post op setting.Bronchoscopy [**2-16**] am>thick secretions @ trachea and R lung, Rlower stump well healed, therapeutic aspiration done.
Chest CT done to evaluate overall pulmonary status- right pleural effusion persists.
