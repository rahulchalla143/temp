She presented at that time to [**Hospital 1559**] Medical Center with acute severe abdominopelvic pain.
She was found to have a torsion of the right ovary and underwent an emergent exploratory laparotomy, right salpingo-oophorectomy.
Final pathology revealed a 15 cm serous cystadenoma of the ovary with a 1 cm disgerminoma of the ovary focussed within the center.
The disgerminoma is identified as well as the serous cyst.
She denies any history of asthma, hypertension, mitral valve prolapse, or thromboembolic disorder.
She reports irregular menstrual cycles, which are moderate to heavy in flow.
She denies any history of pelvic infections or abnormal Pap smears and her last was obtained in 12/[**2156**].
She denies any history of gynecological problems.
She denies any history of verbal, physical, or sexual abuse.
Oral mucosa without evidence of thrush or mucositis.
There are no masses.
LYMPHATICS:  Lymph node survey, negative cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal adenopathy.
BACK:  No spinal or CVA tenderness.
There are no palpable masses.
There is no hepato or splenomegaly.
There is no fluid wave.
A well-healed incision is noted.
EXTREMITIES:  There is no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Urethral meatus normal.
Bimanual exam reveals no mass or lesion.
Slightly limited exam secondary to motion and body habitus however no pulmonary embolus in the central or segmental pulmonary arteries.
Scattered upper lobe predominent bilateral peribronchiolar nodular opacities which may be due to an infectious/inflammatory etiology or aspiration.
Bilateral lower lobes and lingular atelectasis.
Diffuse low attenuation of the liver compatible with fatty infiltration.
Procedure was converted due to difficulty accessing the lymph nodes.
Postoperatively, the patient received a TAP block for pain in the PACU.
She developed tachycardia to 130s.
Arterial blood gas demonstrated hypercarbia with pCO2 to 59.
No pre-operative Hct was drawn, but the post-op HCT was 27.5.
The following were addressed during the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay:  1) Hypoxia: Her hypoxia was likely multifactorial, associated with atelectasis and low RR in the setting of a high morphine dose.
The CXR was consistent with atelectasis.
Patient also noted to have some snoring and full neck likely associated with some degree of sleep apnea.
She was ruled out for pulmonary embolism with CT-A.
The CT did suggest possible aspiration versus infectious etiology with "scattered bilateral peribronchovascular opacities."
The patient clearly denied pain, anxiety; her post-op pain was controlled with dilaudid PCA.
Her post-operative fever could have been contributing to the tachycardia as well.
3) Fever: The patient spiked a fever to 102.5 the evening of POD#0.
CTA was suggestive of possible aspiration pneumonia as an etiology.
Given that her temperature was still elevated to 101.2 at the time of transfer, she was started on IV clindamycin empirically for treatment of aspiration pneumonia.
Following initiation of clindamycin, she remained afebrile for over 24 hours.
She then respiked to a low grade temperature of 100.6.
CXR was repeated, demonstrating bibasilar opacities concerning for ongoing aspiration pneumonia.
The patient spontaneously defervesced, and remained afebrile for the remainder of her hospital stay.
2) Nausea/emesis The patient experienced an episode of nausea with small amount of bilious emesis on POD#3.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
