The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course consisted of complications of congestive heart failure, renal failure requiring hemodialysis and reportedly MSSSA infection.
He denies rest pain and it is questionable whether he has left calf claudication.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Chronic renal insufficiency compounded by acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis and [**Month (only) 205**] admission to outside hospital.
History of congestive heart failure.
History of coronary artery disease.
History of insulin dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus with neuropathy and nephropathy.
Cardiac catheterization x2 without intervention.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Patient's initial foot culture grew staph coag positive sensitive to Clindamycin, Rifamycin, Gentamicin, levofloxacin and oxacillin, resistant to penicillin.
Anaerobes were no growth.
Patient had a rectal swab cultures taken for VRE which was positive for Vancomycin resistant enterococcus.
Patient had PVRs and an ultrasound of the right common femoral artery which indicated a pseudoaneurysm with femoral tibial disease.
Patient then on [**7-9**] underwent an arteriogram by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] which demonstrated a right common femoral pseudoaneurysm and right femoral tibial disease.
Recommendations were right femoral anterior tibial bypass with resection of the pseudoaneurysm.
Cardiology was consulted because of the patient's past medical history of congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease.
He underwent PMIBI which was positive for ischemic changes.
It demonstrated triple vessel disease.
The patient had angioplasty of diagonal #1, both of the angioplastic right coronary artery, proximal and mid stenosis was angioplastied.
The patient developed bright red rectal bleeding on [**2127-7-10**] and underwent a sigmoidoscopy which showed a rectal polyp.
The study was an incomplete study secondary to incomplete evacuation of the bowel.
General surgery was consulted because the patient became hypotensive and hypovolemic and was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit.
He underwent a rigid scope at that time which was negative for bleeding.
Rule out cardiac myocardial infarction was done.
There were no electrocardiographic changes.
There was bleeding at the distal cecum and was infiltrated with resolution of the bleeding.

The patient continue do bleed and returned to the operating room for oversewing of the rectal ulcer bleed.
Plastic service was consulted regarding recommendations for appropriate wound closure.
On [**7-25**] the patient returned to the gastrointestinal suite and underwent sigmoidoscopy and polypectomy without incident.
The patient continued with his VAC dressing since admission and the last VAC change was on [**7-25**].
Right common femoral pseudoaneurysm and femoral tibial    disease, status post resection of right common femoral    pseudoaneurysm with patch angioplasty with Dacron and a    right femoral to AT bypass with in situ saphenous vein.
Status post diagnostic arteriogram.
Coronary artery disease with a history of congestive heart    failure with a positive PMIBI and ejection fraction of    23%.
Gastrointestinal bleed secondary to rectal polyp, status    post colonoscopy on [**2127-7-11**], status post oversewing    of rectal ulceration on [**2127-7-12**], status post follow    up rigid scope on [**2127-7-13**] which was negative.
Patient with history of chronic renal insufficiency and a    history of acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis,    remote.
History of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus controlled.
Blood loss anemia, transfused.
