Admission Date:  [**2132-11-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-12-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2061-11-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**] Chief Complaint: Neck swelling.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**12-1**] SVC venogram with initiation of TPA therapy [**12-2**] PICC line placed in IR [**12-2**] TPA cath check  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 1683**] is a 71-year-old man with adenocarcinoma of the rectum (diagnosed in [**6-/2131**]) who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by proctosigmoidectomy and a left lower lobe resection for pathologically confirmed lung metastases.
Following two cycles of FOLFOX chemotherapy, he underwent resection of a 1.7 cm solitary liver metastasis in [**2132-6-29**].
Oxaliplatin was eliminated due to neuropathy.
He was admitted to OMED for prehydration and CTPA following discovery of non-occlusive thrombus around his port and finding of hypoxia with tachycardia in clinic on day of admission.
He had been seen by his primary care physican two days prior and noted to have neck swelling, at which time a CT was done that showed non-occlusive clot around his port.
However, when at clinic he was noted to be dyspneic with minimal exertion.
Decision was made to admit to hospital for further monitoring and work-up of pulmonary embolus.
He had attributed this to the chemotherapy he is recieving, as he has experienced these symptoms in the past in conjunction with chemotx.
He denies symptoms of CHF, including orthopnea, PND, lower extremity swelling.
He notes that he has had an MI in the past; also he has significant smoking history, history of hypertension, hyperlipid, and diabetes (diet-controlled?).
ASCVD, status post MI in [**2111**] status post PTCA.
Past Oncological History Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the rectum - [**6-/2131**]: The patient presented with a change in bowel habits and was noted to have an abnormal rectal exam by his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 39262**] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] gastrointestinal evaluation.
- [**2131-7-23**] colonoscopy: Exophytic cancer of the rectum 8-12 cm above the anal margin.
- [**2131-7-25**] rectal ultrasound: T3 posterior midline tumor with luminal narrowing of the rectum.
- [**2131-8-2**] CT scan of the torso: Irregular, polypoid lesion seen within the rectum, with multiple subcentimeter presacral and pericolic lymph nodes identified.
Two pulmonary nodules seen in the left lower lobe, the largest measuring 2.9 x 2.2 cm.
Multiple low-attenuation lesions seen within the liver, the largest of which may represent cyst, smaller lesions are not fully characterized.
Low-attenuation lesions seen within the left kidney, possibly a cyst, although too small to characterize.
Pathology revealed adenocarcinoma of the rectum, low-grade, with invasion into the perirectal adipose tissue and metastasis to 7 of 13 regional lymph nodes (T3N2).
There is a new FDG-avid focus in segment 4A of the liver which most likely represents metastasis.
- [**2132-2-13**]: Ileostomy takedown with simultaneous flexible bronchoscopy and VATS with left lower lobe resection.
Pathology from the ileostomy stoma demonstrated findings consistent with ileostomy stoma with no evidence of malignancy.
The left lower lobe wedge resection demonstrated an adenocarcinoma, 4.1 cm, consistent with metastasis of rectal origin.
- [**2132-2-14**]: Evaluation by the hepatobiliary surgery consult team due to the finding on his recent PET scan of a likely liver metastasis.
It was felt that the lesion was amenable to surgical resection, and it was planned that the patient would undergo two cycles of chemotherapy prior to proceeding with hepatic resection.
- [**2132-7-11**]: Hepatic resection of a 1.7cm segment 4a metastatic lesion by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Oxaliplatin eliminated due to neuropathy.
- [**2132-11-19**]: Presented to clinic to begin cycle 2 of 5FU/LV for his resected colon cancer.
Family History: The patient's maternal uncle had an abdominal cancer, details unclear.
Physical Exam: Physical Exam at Admission Vitals: BP 133/63, HR 90, RR 14, sat 95% gen-well appearing man, NAD, appears stated age, ruddy complexion HEENT-nc/at, perrla, EOMI, +plethoric face/ruddy complexion, anicteric, MMM neck-swelling without obvious JVD, no LAD, supple chest-b/l ae no w/c/r heart-s1s2 rrr no m/r/g abd-+well healed abdominal surgical scars, +bs, soft, NT, ND ext-no c/c/e, L.arm-with instrumentation 1+edema, 2+pulses neuro-aaox3, CN2-12 intact, non-focal .
No gross pulmonary embolism, subject to suboptimal pulmonary arterial opacification.
that if evaluation of PE is needed in the future, it should be evaluated by IVC rather than upper extremity injection.
SVC thrombosis with extension in right and left brachiocephalic veins.
Left inferior pulmonary vein thrombosis.
New and enlarging lung nodules, worrisome for metastasis.
Prior left lower lobe wedge resection and partial liver resection with no signs of local recurrence.
Unchanged T4 lesion since [**2131**] of indeterminate clinical significance.
[**11-28**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior, inferolateral and basal inferoseptal segments (proximal RCA lesion).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is no aortic regurgitation .The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
[**12-1**] CT head:  Normal non-contrast head CT with no evidence of metastasis.
If metastasis is of clinical concern, MR is a more sensitive modality for the evaluation of intracranial metastasis.
Repeat SVC venogram demonstrated flow improvement in the SVC with no collateral veins across the midline.
Venous angioplasty with balloon dilation with further improvement of the flow in the SVC.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary, this is a 71 year-old man with history of metastatic colon cancer s/p multiple surgeries, including proctosigmoidectomy, lung and liver resections, now on cycle 2 of 5 FU/LV presenting from clinic with hypoxia, tachycardia and dyspnea with mild exertion.
DYSPNEA ON EXERTION / HYPOXIA Differential diagnosis at admission included pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infectious process, SVC syndrome, and CHF (given cardiac risk factors).
After prehydration, CTPA was done that showed SVC thrombosis with extension into the right and left brachiocephalic veins.
There was no pulmonary arterial embolism.
Pulmonary service was consulted and agreed that given imaging findings and history of facial swelling and redness, SVC syndrome was a very likely explanation for his symptoms.
Prior to procedure, CT head was done that showed no intracranial metastases.
LOW PLATELETS Platelets were downtrending at time of discharge.
There is concern of HIT given that he was on heparin throughout hospitalization, although his platelet count is still high at 117 (and there were several fluctuations in platelet levels from day to day).
If his platelet count continues to fall, he may need readmission and bridging to coumadin with DTI like argatroban.
METASTATIC COLORECTAL ADENOCARCINOMA On cycle 2 of 5FU/LV; further plan for chemotherapy is per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
HYPERTENSION We continued his outpatient beta-blocker while hospitalized.
ACEI was held for concern of worsening renal failure in setting of multiple contrast loads for CTPA and intravenous thrombolysis.
CHRONIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE Full echocardiogram report is above.
Findings are consistent with CAD and sytolic dysfunction.
DIABETES MELLITUS (?DIET-CONTROLLED?)
PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY We continued his outpatient vitamin B6.
Heparin drip was given for SVC thrombus with switch to Lovenox at discharge.
