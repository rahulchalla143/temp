There is mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
There is no hydrocephalus.
MRI Head [**11-5**](Post-op):showing gross total resection of mass.
CT Head [**11-6**]: dilitation of temporal horns, with mass effect to the basal cisterns and 4th ventricle.
She was additionally started on decadron to treat surrounding mass effect.
She was then taken to the OR on [**11-4**], for posterior fossa craniotomy and mass resection(preliminary pathology is metastatic carcinoma).
On [**11-5**], she had her post-resection MRI of the head which showed gross total resection with a small amount of expected blood in the surgical cavity.
On [**11-6**], she complained of nausea, vomiting, and subtle visual changes.
A stat head CT was performed, showing early hydrocephalus and worsened mass effect.
She was given decadron, mannitol and lasix, and transferred to the ICU for scrupulous neurological monitoring.

You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.
-An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).
You are being sent home on steroid medication(tapering to a standing dose of Decadron 2mg twice daily), make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.

These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
