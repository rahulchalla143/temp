Pt transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of brain mass found on CT scan.
Prior incarceration for assault & battery (reportedly for going after someone who tried to harm his sister).

There is mild interstitial edema.
No sizable effusions or consolidations are seen.
[**3-17**] CT Head w/o contrast: 4.1 x 3.8 x 5 cm left frontal mass lesion arising from the left frontal skull/dura consistent with the given history of meningioma.
The mass and associated edema cause 5 mm contralateral midline shift and slight compression of the left lateral ventricle.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
[**3-18**]/ MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]: Extra-axial left frontal mass lesion resulting in edema of the underlying left frontal lobe.
The lesion is most consistent with a meningioma as suggested in the given history.
Although considered much less likely, the differential diagnosis also could include dural-based lymphoma, sarcoid or a metastasis.
However, there are no features suggestive of these alternate diagnoses.
No ST changes.
INDICATION: 45-year-old man with new brain mass of unclear primary.
CT OF CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: No parenchymal consolidation or pleural effusion is noted.
There are multiple small 2-mm nodules at the right lung periphery that most likely represent airspace disease.
There is a 2.3 x 1.5 cm nodule in the left adrenal gland that does not have the appearance of the adenoma.
There is a small hypodense lesion within the upper pole of the left kidney that cannot be further characterized.
No pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy is seen.
No free air or gas is seen within the abdomen.
No pathologically enlarged inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy is seen.
BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesion is seen.
Multiple sclerotic areas within the vertebral bodies of thoracic vertebrae most likely represent degenerative change.
A 2.3 x 1.5 cm nodule in the left adrenal gland that does not have the appearance of adenoma.
Multiple 2-mm nodules in the right lung periphery most likely represent airspace disease.
No pathologically enlarged lymphadenopathy is noted within the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
********ADDENDUM*********** After complete assesssment of the left adrenal nodule in the non-contrast, post-contrast, and 3-minute delayed images, we believe that this mass is most likely adenoma,especially the low attenuation on pre-contrast images.
Brief Hospital Course:  # Brain Mass:  The pt was found to have brain mass at OSH after presenting with mental status changes/loss of consciousness in the setting of heroin overdose and DKA.
He underwent repeat head CT and MR, which revealed 4.1 x 3.8 x 5 cm left frontal mass w/ edema, causing 5 mm contralateral midline shift and slight compression of the left lateral ventricle.
Based on imaging, the lesion is thought to be most consistent with a meningioma.
Although much less likely, dural-based lymphoma, sarcoid or a metastasis are also possible.
To evaluate for the latter, the pt underwent pan-CT, which was unremarkable except for a left adrenal nodule that was thought to be an adenoma.
Despite the size of the brain mass, the pt showed no neurologic deficits.
He was treated with dexamethasone & phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis.
# DM:  Pt reportedly has type II DM.
Pt admits to having poorly controlled DM prior to admission.
Pt has a h/o polysubstance abuse, starting from his early teenage years.
Additionally, he states that he has chronic pain, which has been attributed to LE neuropathy, for which he self-medicates with heroin as well as vicodin.
However, in the acute setting, with the pt having just learned that of his brain tumor, they were unable to discern whether his behavior was primarily from a mood disorder or from response to the stressful situation.
Because the pt had significant anxiety as well as difficulty sleeping they recommended Seroquel, at least as a temporizing measure.
# Neuropathy ??????
the pt reportedly has LE neuropathy which causes a throbbing, tingling pain in both legs, but is worse in his right leg.
His dose of neurontin was increased during this hospitalization and he was given oxycontin with breakthrough oxycodone for his pain (instead of vicodin).
His lower extremity motor and sensation exams were intact.
# HTN ??????
# ARF ??????
on admission, the pt was in ARF from diabetic ketoacidosis.
# Skin Abrasions ??????
pt was noted to have multiple skin lesions [**Company **] he time of admission.
He was seen by dermatology, who felt the lesions were most c/w skin abrasions.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 Puffs Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Right Frontal Brain Mass NOS.
Diabetic Ketoacidosis.
2.3 x 1.5 cm nodule in the left adrenal gland (thought to be adenoma by CT) 6.
Discharge Instructions: You presented to the hospital with extremely high blood sugar levels that (on top of your heroin use) caused you to lose consciousness, have kidney failure, and breathing problems.
For seizure prevention (from your brain mass): -Dexamethasone -Phenytoin .
