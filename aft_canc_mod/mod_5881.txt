Anemia: Her laboratories at OSH were consistent with but not diagnostic of hemolysis; she did not display signs of active bleeding.
The haptoglobin at [**Hospital1 18**] was elevated pointing against hemolysis.
Given her low hematocrit.
A CT scan at [**Hospital1 18**] showed extensive clot burden in her portal system, likely related to her prior surgery.
LDH was persistently elevated likely secondary to abdominal clot process.
Her pain was controlled with Dilaudid as needed.
Plan was for pt to remain until able to tolerate clears with only po pain meds, but she chose to leave AMA (form signed).
Expressed understanding of need to return if abdominal pain increases.
Thrombocytosis:  Likely related to recent splenectomy, improved from 1.5 million to 900K at time of d/c.
No localizing sources of infection with the exception of abdominal pain.
Our recommendation was that she stay until being able to tolerate po with only percocet for pain control.
