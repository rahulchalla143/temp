BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2173-3-17**], Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] was transferred from the Bone Marrow Transplant service to the Fenard Intensive Care Unit for management of rapid atrial fibrillation up to a heart rate of the 150s that was unresponsive to po and intravenous Metoprolol.
Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] had been admitted to the Bone Marrow Transplant team for fever and neutropenia and started on Vancomycin and Cefepime.
However, Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] continued to spike fevers and was begun on Ampicillin, transitioned to Voriconazole and then restarted on Ampicillin and Caspofungin for possible fungal pneumonia.
On chest CT Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] was noted to have bilateral pulmonary opacities whose appearance appeared most consistent with a fungal process, especially given his continued fevers on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denied mouth pain, sore throat.
No chest pain.
His chest has fine, Velcro-like crackles throughout, occasional anterior wheezes.
Cardiovascular exam is tachycardiac; irregularly irregular; no murmurs.
It was felt that his rapid atrial fibrillation was likely secondary to the pulmonary infiltrates noted on his chest CT scan and that the pulmonary process was causing his irregular rhythm.
Therefore, decision was made to treat Mr. [**Known lastname 19064**] atrial fibrillation conservatively with a goal of rate control while trying to treat his underlying pulmonary infection.
Unfortunately, Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] became hypotensive with both blood pressure and rate control agents on board and these agents had to be discontinued.
He was Digoxin loaded according to renal parameters.
Pulmonary infiltrates:  At the time of transfer the Infectious Disease team thought that his infiltrates are likely fungal.
His antibiotic coverage for fungal organisms was broadened with Ampicillin and Caspofungin for empiric Aspergillosis ......... treatment.
Clinically, Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] appeared to improve with decreasing respiratory rate and improved oxygen saturations with decreasing oxygen requirements.
The chest CT scan on [**2173-3-23**] showed marked progression of bilateral ill defined pulmonary nodular opacities throughout all lobes becoming more confluent at the left base.
Given the progression of the pulmonary infiltrates, the Infectious Disease service was concerned that his antibiotic coverage and fungal coverage were inadequate.
At this point, given the progression of his pulmonary infiltrates, it was felt that tissue diagnosis was necessary.
He had a very small left apical pneumothorax post procedure.
His chest tube was able to be pulled on [**2173-3-26**] without incidence.
He was able to be weaned from face mask to nasal cannula oxygen post procedure without difficulty.
At the time of the dictation the micro data from his VATS left upper lobe and left lower lobe lung biopsies was still pending.
Please see next dictation for final pathology and microbiology data.
Right cerebrovascular accident:  During his stay in the Intensive Care Unit Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] was noted to have a new left facial droop.
CT scan was done to evaluate for a hemorrhagic infarct.
The head CT scan showed a subacute right MCA infarct.
Given that Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] was thrombocytopenic with a platelet count of 14, his anticoagulation had been on hold.
The atrial fibrillation in the setting of his left ventricular thrombus made Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] at high risk for throwing further emboli.
Further consult opinion could just slightly lower Mr. [**Known lastname 19064**] target blood pressure as long as his neurologic symptoms did not worsen.
Over the next couple of days Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] did not develop any further neurological deficits.
He appeared to have slightly decreased left upper extremity strength, possible left pronator drift, and a very small left facial droop which seemed to improve slowly.
Splenic infarct:  On the day following the right cerebrovascular accident on [**2173-3-20**] Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] developed significant left upper quadrant pain.
This study was limited because Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] was unable to drink oral contrast, and he could not have intravenous contrast at this time secondary to acute renal failure.
Due to the concern for emboli to the spleen in the setting of a recent right MCA cerebrovascular accident, Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] was started on intravenous Heparin.
It was felt that this safe because his platelets at this point had increased above 50.
Acute renal failure:  On transfer to the Intensive Care Unit Mr. [**Known lastname 19064**] creatinine was 1.3.
It was felt that this was possibly secondary to his AmBisome or possibly ATN from hypotension in the setting of receiving Lopressor and Diltiazem for control of his atrial fibrillation.
The Renal service was consulted for assistance with the management of his acute renal failure.
Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] continued to have gentle hydration of his kidneys, and his medications were renally dosed to minimize their toxicity.
Coronary artery disease:  Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] has a history of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease.
He was initially off aspirin secondary to his thrombocytopenia.
He did have a mild troponin weak in the setting of his rapid atrial fibrillation.
This was also in the setting of acute renal failure which complicated interpretation of the troponin.
Congestive heart failure:  Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] had a history of congestive heart failure for which he was on Lasix and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor as an outpatient.
In addition, his ACE inhibitor had been held secondary to hypotension.
He should be restarted as his blood pressure improves and he stabilizes and his acute renal failure improves.
Mantle cell lymphoma status post chemotherapy:  Mr. [**Known lastname 19064**] mantle cell lymphoma appeared to be in remission during his stay in the Intensive Care Unit.
His platelets were monitored and he was transfused when his hematocrit dropped below 30 given that he had history of coronary artery disease.
