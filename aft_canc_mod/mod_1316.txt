Admission Date:  [**2158-6-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-6-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2113-1-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Latex / Levaquin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**] Chief Complaint: dizziness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bedside drainage of perirectal abscess PICC line placement  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 45 year old male with a PMHx of metastatic RCC  (papillary vs clear cell) to lungs & L pleural effusions s/p multiple chemo regimens (most recently cycle 10 of bevacizumab +  erlotinib on [**2158-4-13**]), presents after a recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for PNA now with dizziness and lightheadedness.
He was started on a 14-day course of unasyn & doxycycline for post-obstructive pna but was ultimately discharged on augmentin.
Most recently, he was admitted again from [**2158-5-10**] - [**2158-5-16**] for respiratory failure due to post obstructive pneumonia and progressive metastatic disease to the lungs, as well as the pleural effusion.
CT scan showed mild colitis affecting the distal descending and sigmoid colon.
He was initially started on vanco/zosyn/azithromycin out of concern for possible sepsis (given patient has recent pneumonia requiring intubation).
Antibiotics were stopped given rapid improvement of his hypotension and it was thought his hypotension/fever was felt to be related to underlying RCC and immulogical response by his primary outpatient oncologist.
Since being discharged, he has had increased pain in his perineum and was evaluated by a surgeon yesterday who recommended aspiration of a potential abscess today.
He woke this morning and developed some lightheadedness which he has had previously with dehydration.
He denies chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations.
CT showed diffuse colitis from cecum to hepatic flexure and stable metastatic disease, no focal abscess.
Colorectal following.
No fevers but immunosuppressed, on chemo.
Also, endorses diarrhea but not bloody or dark stools.

# Hypotension: Initially thought to be [**3-2**] poor PO vs distributive physiology from cdiff infection/rectal abscess.
Bedside echo did not show evidence of tamponade.
His underlying infection was treated with antibiotics.
His tachycardia is likely multifactorial from pain, underlying infection and cancer, anxiety.
He had worsening tachycardia and hypotension until the time of his death.
#Hypoxia/Shortness of breath: Patient had worsening dyspnea throughout his stay.
CT scan showed significant worsening of his pulmonary metastases, stable pleural effusions, and a likely pneumonia.
# Colitis: Cdiff positive.
KUB with evidence of worsening colitis and patient with lower abdominal pain.
Imaging with no evidence of perforation or megacolon.
Patient continues to be afebrile with improving leukocytosis and decreased stool output.
Generally improving clinically from a colitis standpoint.
# rectal abscess ??????
patient had beside I&D of a rectal abscess by colorectal surgery (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] without complication.
ICU Course: Patient initially presented with presumptive shock due to c.diff colitis, the hypotension was resolved promtply with fluid challenge, however the patient quickly became volume overloaded due to what was found to be new-onset heart failure with an EF significantly depressed from previous studies.
The patient had complained of significant abdominal pain, palliative care was consulted and the patients pain medication regimen was adjusted with excellent symptomatic control.
-hypoxia, tachypnea, tachycardia has been omnipresent [**6-20**] -CTA-Chest revealed new RUL ground-glass opacities c/w likely hemorrhage vs infectious process; the patient was started on cefipime, vanc, and bactrim (for PCP empiric treatment).
The patient has been intermittently on bipap for respiratory distress.
[**6-21**] -Continued progression of respiratory decompensation, CT scan findings were confirmed to be significant worsening of thoracic tumor burden, the patient had an episode of tachypnea and worsening tachycardia overnight which resulted in bipap, additional doses of ativan, and lasix for diuresis.
[**6-22**] -the patients respiratory status continued to decline, tachypnea persisted and the patient is reliant on a face-mask for oxygenation, desaturating into the high 80s after less than a minute with oxygen.
A chest xray was performed which revealed worsening edema and collapse of the RUL, likely c/w obstructive process due to metastatic disease.
[**Date range (1) 22999**] -the patient had persistent respiratory distress, palliative care was consulted and the patient was started on a dilaudid gtt for pain and respiratory distress management according to comfort care guidelines; his ativan was titrated back to q6 with PRN dosing maintained.
Despite these efforts the patient continued to decline with persistent hypotension, tachycardia, but improving distress symptoms likely given the increasing titration and palliative doses of IV narcotics.
[**6-26**] -the patient remained somnolent, unresponsive to verbal stimuli, at rounds the patient had rapid/shallow respirations, his blood pressures were 50's systolic with mottling of his lower extremities and cool extremities throughout; his appearance was noted to be peri-arrest.
During rounds, Dr [**Known lastname 22998**] became progressively hypotensive, eventually became bradycardic and went into cardiac arrest; resuscitation was not initiated according to standing DNR/DNI; family was present at the bedside and the patient expired at 0950.
