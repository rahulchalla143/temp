The patient had a decreased hematocrit to 27.3 on [**3-29**] and transfused one unit of packed red blood cells, and his hematocrit rose appropriately to 29.5 and remained stable at 29.7 at the time of discharge.
He had no other symptoms and no active bleeding.
This was felt to be due to his continued myelodysplastic syndrome.
Over the weekend he continued to have right lower extremity swelling and tenderness in his right metatarsophalangeal which was thought to be consistent with his gout flare.
Given his recent cardiac catheterization for the valvuloplasty, a lower extremity ultrasound was performed to rule out any deep venous thrombosis on the right.
The patient remained stable with no other active issues over the weekend, and is awaiting placement at a rehabilitation facility as soon as a bed is available.
