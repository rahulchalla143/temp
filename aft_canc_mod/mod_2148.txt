The abdominal pain is diffuse and achy.
He states that he's had abdominal pain x 1 month and recently returned from [**Country 3587**] where he was evaluated and treated with a "medication" that improved his symptoms there.
He has mild constipation.
As a result, a CT torso was obtained on [**2170-10-5**] and the preliminary read showed multiple masses suggestive of lymphoma.
Per OMR records, the patient has a long-standing history of abdominal pain since [**2164**] but imaging was obtained only recently.
He was subsequently admitted to OB on TB precautions for further workup of his grossly abnormal CT scan.
No OIs 2.
Pulmonary tuberculosis.

Bilateral diffuse tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] densities which are compatible with the patient's diagnosis of TB.
Anterior mediastinal, mesenteric and pelvic nodal masses compatible with the diagnosis of high- grade lymphoma.
Multiple small hypodense liver lesions and kidney lesions are too small to characterize.
[**-8/3862**]  immunophenotyping; BM  ==============    DIAGNOSIS     ============ SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY: DIAGNOSIS: MARKEDLY HYPERCELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH PROMINENT EOSINOPHILS AND SCATTERED LYMPHOHISTIOCYTIC AGGREGATES.
Note: There is no morphological evidence of lymphoma.
Special stains for acid fast (AFB) and fungal (PAS, GMS) organisms are negative.
INTERPRETATION The immunophenotypic findings in conjunction with histological and immunohistochemical studies are consistent with a diagnosis of plasmablastic lymphoma (HHV8 negative subtype) .
Patchy areas of opacification again seen, especially in the right upper zone.
Haziness of the left and also probably right bases could reflect free pleural fluid.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2170-10-10**] at 10:46:11 AM The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

# Abdominal Pain/Lymphadenopathy:  Pt presented with diffuse and achy abdominal pain, which he had for the preceding month.
A CT torso was performed on [**2170-10-5**], with preliminary read showing multiple masses suggestive of lymphoma.
Both bone marrow and abdominal lymphnode biopsies demonstrated plasmablastic lymphoma.
# Tumor lysis syndrome/methemoglobinemia: The patient was admitted with concern- Check tumor lysis.
The renal team was consulted on [**10-8**] for spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome, with specific question of prophylactic hemodialysis, and recommended rasburicase to decrease serum uric acid.
On [**10-8**] in the evening, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7600**] for hypoxia with desaturations to the 80's.
A discrepancy was noted between his oxygen saturations and PaO2 on ABG.
Methemoglobin level was noted to be elevated at 10%.
# Tuberculosis/Eosinophilia/HIV: Infectious disease was consulted for help with management of tuberculosis, HIV, and possible parasitic infection given elevated eosinophilia; they recommended continuing treatment for tuberculosis and treating for possible parasitic infection with ivermectin x 2.
Charcot-[**Location (un) 5244**] crystals were seen in the stool, which was thought to be secondary to successful treatment of intestinal parasites.
Sputum from [**9-27**] had been positive for minimal AFB, concerning for either profound immunosuppression, noncompliance, and/or MDR TB.
MTD testing was negative for M. Tuberculosis on [**10-3**].
