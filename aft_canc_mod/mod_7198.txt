HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with metastatic breast cancer, diagnosed in [**2161-11-13**], presenting to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**2161-12-12**] for shortness of breath times several weeks, worsening over the last few days.
She does have two pillow orthopnea but negative paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, no chest pain or palpitations.
She has noted increasing lower extremity edema over the last week.
She has cough which is productive of white sputum but no night sweats or weight loss.
She denies fever, chills, nausea or vomiting.
The patient's previous workup for shortness of breath has included a CT angiogram on [**2161-12-2**] which was negative for pulmonary embolism but notable for bilateral ground-glass opacities.
A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 70% with mild aortic and mitral regurgitation.
She has moderate pericardial effusion as noted by the transthoracic echocardiogram.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Pelvic mass found in the left adnexal region measuring 6 x 4 cm, which is likely metastatic versus primary ovarian in origin.
Infiltrating ductal carcinoma, ER positive, HR2/neu negative with omental metastases, retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
MRI of the head revealed no metastatic disease, however, bone scan indicated thoracic metastases.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history is significant for coronary artery disease in the patient's father, however, no family history of cancer.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
General:  Patient in no acute distress, resting comfortably in bed, appears younger than her stated age.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: Oropharynx clear, moist mucous membranes, jugular venous pulsation not elevated, neck supple, anicteric sclerae, extraocular movements intact, no lymphadenopathy present in the cervical region.
Chest:  Bilateral basilar crackles without wheezing, left axillary lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate, normal S1 and S2, no S3 or S4, II/VI murmur at left sternal border.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  2+ bilateral pitting edema, no cyanosis or clubbing, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally, skin warm and dry.
Chest x-ray, [**2161-12-12**] revealed bilateral interstitial infiltrates, bilateral pleural effusions, mild congestive heart failure.
Transthoracic echocardiogram, [**2161-12-16**] showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy, hyperdynamic left ventricular function with a moderate pericardial effusion, no change from echocardiogram on [**2161-12-8**].
Transthoracic echocardiogram, [**2162-1-4**] showed left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55% with loculated moderate sized 1.5 cm pericardial effusion with fibrin deposits on the surface of the heart; no echocardiographic signs of tamponade; compared with prior echocardiogram, the pericardial effusion appears loculated at this point.
Electrocardiogram on admission showed normal sinus rhythm, Q waves in III and AVF which were old and T wave abnormalities in V2 through V6 which were nonspecific.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, breast cancer and anemia, who presents with acute worsening of chronic shortness of breath.
Cardiovascular:  The patient was initially thought to be in congestive heart failure and was aggressive diuresed until her creatinine bumped.
She was ruled out for a myocardial infarction by negative cardiac enzymes on numerous occasions during her hospitalization.
Serial echocardiograms were performed times four, which showed moderate sized pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade but evidence of diastolic dysfunction.
Therefore, a pericardial window was placed on [**2162-1-1**] with greater than 200 cc of bloody fluid out, and the drain was left in until [**2162-1-5**].
As the pericardial fluid was bloody, there was concern for a malignant effusion, however, cytology revealed no malignant cells.
It was significant for reactive mesothelial cells, red blood cells, lymphocytes and neutrophils.
The patient also had occasional episodes of ectopy, both atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia, which was thought to be related to the pericardial window and drain, with resulting irritation.
She was started on metoprolol 25 mg twice a day for both rhythm abnormalities and for improvement of congestive heart failure.
Pulmonary:  The patient's main complaint on admission was acute worsening of chronic dyspnea over the last month.
Upon medical record review, it appears that the patient has had complaints of dyspnea since [**2161-7-13**] and, during her previous admission at the beginning of [**Month (only) **], she was noted to have oxygen saturation of 91% in room air.
The cardiologic etiologies of the dyspnea was extensively investigated but, as she had no improvement with diuresis, pericardial window and multiple rule outs for myocardial infarction, it was felt that there was a pulmonary etiology as the most likely explanation for her dyspnea.
Given the patient's history of chronic metastatic breast cancer, lymphatic spread of the cancer was thought to be the source of her dyspnea.
A thoracentesis was performed on [**2161-12-30**] and 600 cc of yellow straw colored fluid was removed.
The fluid was later found to be positive for malignant cells, consistent with adenocarcinoma.
With fluid hydration after the pericardial window was placed, the creatinine trended down and is currently at 1.6 at the time of discharge.
Hematology:  The patient has a baseline pernicious anemia and received B12 injection on admission.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient is chronically constipated but had worsening of her constipation throughout her hospitalization.
Her abdomen became progressively more distended and tender during the end of her hospital course while she was in the MICU.
An abdominal x-ray showed a distended large bowel, however, she was eventually able to move her bowels two to three days prior to discharge.
Her abdominal exam did not significantly improve after the bowel movements and, given her elevated lactate, there was concern for bowel wall ischemia, ileus or obstruction from her previous known large pelvic mass.
The etiology of her abdominal pain was most likely functional constipation and she was continued on an aggressive bowel regimen with per rectum medication and enemas as needed.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Throughout her hospitalization, the patient had a minimal appetite secondary to cancer anorexia and had a few episodes of nausea and emesis.
Her emesis was thought secondary to functional constipation.
She was able to tolerate fluids and pureed food on occasion and was able to take most of her oral medications.
Oncology:  On admission, the patient had a known diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer, which was recently diagnosed in [**2161-11-13**].
Metastatic breast cancer, bone, retroperitoneal lymph nodes and omentum.
Pelvic mass thought secondary to breast cancer metastases or primary ovarian tumor.
Diastolic congestive heart failure.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Acute renal failure/chronic renal insufficiency.
Chronic dyspnea, thought secondary to lymphangitic spread of carcinoma.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
