He has been doing relatively well at home since his most recent two hospital admissions: [**Date range (1) 73068**] admitted with progressive weakness due to pneumonia and UTI and [**Date range (1) 73067**] with fever and found to have a pansensitive E. coli bacteremia, Vancomycin sensitive enterococcal bacteremia, and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] blood stream infection.
That hospitalization included marked LFT abnormalities, and a question of a cholecystitis versus possible drug reaction.
The drug challenge was performed because he had a severe reaction to Azacitadine with multiple skin complications including neutrophilic dermatoses and ischemic bowel.
He developed sudden onset SSCP which then radiated to the back, described as a throbbing sensation, not similar to chronic back pain.
There was a thought there may be some ST depressions in V4-V5, which resolved after the above.
A bedside echo was performed by the cardiology fellow with new inferolateral hypokinesis so he was transferred urgently for cath, lab was activated overnight.
Cath revealed single vessel right dominant disease with 70% stenosis of the RCA.
His CP was attributed to demand ischemia and troponin peaked at 0.07 before trending down.
was noted to have temp of 104 without localizing symptoms for infection.
Vancomycin was changed to Daptomycin today given concern for allergy.
UA showed trace leuks, few bacteria and CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia.
He also developed asymptomatic hypotension in the CCU with systolics in the 80s, responsive to fluid.
He was afebrile otherwise throughout CCU stay.
He had a few hours of [**Last Name (un) **], transient hypoxia with SaO2 88 on RA which resolved with 2L nasal O2.
He denies fevers, rigors, chills, new pain, cough, dysuria or focal symptoms of infection.
He also denies chest pain, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath.

2) Ventriculography revealed an estimated EF of 55% with mild inferior hypokinesis and mild mitral regurgitation.
3) Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial hypotension, with a central aortic pressure of 80/38 mmHg.
There was no systolic pressure gradient between the aorta and the left ventricle, upon careful pullback of the pigtailed catheter.
The patient as well favored this approach, understanding that an intervention may interfere with his chemotherapeutic plan.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild systolic ventricular dysfunction.
[**2135-9-5**] Echo Very limited views obtained.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Lung volumes have minimally increased, potentially suggesting improved ventilation.
Moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged evidence of mild-to-moderate interstitial fluid overload.
No evidence of pneumonia.
No evidence for hematoma.
Persistent increased bilateral pleural effusions.
Suspected chronic avascular necrosis involving each femoral head, with more prominent findings on the right than left side.
MODERATE GROWTH.
BLOOD Cultures all negative  Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with a history of MDS evolving to AML with increasing transfusion requirement and severe pancytopenia.
His post-treatment course was complicated by fever, LFT abnormalities, and a question of a cholecystitis.
# MDS and pancytopenia: Pt's current cycle 2 of decitabine stopped after 8 days.
Pt w/ unstable angina found to have fixed stenotic lesion of the RCA, thought by cards to be causing demand ischemia and favored medical mgmt.
Pt had a drop in HCT, which along with his abdominal pain was concerning for an intraabdominal bleed--CT did not demonstrate hemmorrhage.
# Pneumonia and infection: Pt had fever in late [**Month (only) **] to 104 while on fluconazole, flagyl, cipro.
A source of infection failed to be identified.
The next day pt spiked to 104.3, coughing up green sputum and became increasingly confused and then obtunded.
Given pt's renal failure and goals of care, the infection was not treated.
# ARF:  Toward the end of his life, pt developed ARF, obtundation, and low blood pressure w/ pseudomonas lung infection.
The pt's decline in mental status was most likely  [**1-19**] to sepsis and uremia from ARF which may have been precipitated by sepsis as well as IV acyclovir.
The patient also developed a pericardial friction rub correlating with his ARF.
#CAD: The pt developed chest pain during the course of this hospital stay.
EKG showed ST depressions in V4-V5 that resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin and morphine.
An echo was performed with showed new infererolateral hypokinesis.
The pt was taken urgently to cardiac catheterization where a 70% osteal right coronary artery disease was discovered.
Medical management was started with atorvastatin 20mg not the usual 80mg due to medication interactions and low dose metoprolol.
He was observed in the CCU for approximately 24 hrs where his blood pressures remained stable and he remained chest pain free.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he remained pain free, hemodynamically stable.
Pt had hypercalcemia which improved with fluids and pamidronate x 1.
Pt's hypokal and hypomag were aggressively repleted with termination of premature ventricular beats.
