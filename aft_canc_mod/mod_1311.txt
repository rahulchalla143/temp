Left-sided thoracentesis  tracheotomy  Peg placement   History of Present Illness: 66 year old male with known metastatic thyroid CA to spine, brain, ribs presented to Dr.[**Name (NI) 6767**] office for routine follow-up today.
The patient has back pain but no numbness or tingling.
The pain in his back is more of a dull ache and is not nearly as painful as the pain he had in his neck prior to the cyberknife treatment he had at C1 in [**Month (only) 958**] of this year.
He has not had any urinary incontinence but did notice stool staining in his underwear twice this week when he woke up in the morning.
He has had controlled bowel movements since then and reports no loss of sensation in the groin or buttock region.
The patient noticed that his right leg felt slightly weaker recently, but he had a right hip replacement and attributed the weakness to that surgery.
The patient had an MRI of the thoracic spine which showed a new large lesion almost completely occluding the canal.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] sent him to the ER for neurosurgical evaluation.
Past Medical History: Metastatic Thyroid Ca HTN Atrial Fibrillation Pulmonary Embolus [**1-28**] - Anticoagulated with coumadin; has two small lesions on MRI head c/w mets but not contraindications  to anticoag.
Hypothyroidism  Social History: Lives with wife.
Smoked approximately 30 years ago (quit in [**2126**]) EtOH: drinks 1 glass wine/day   Family History: Mother with h/o emphysema.
Surgical incision well-healed.
No sensory loss in thoracic region or in legs.
[**2160-8-1**]  IMPRESSION: Bony metastatic disease involving the T4, T5, T9, and T10 vertebrae.
Spinous process metastasis at T5 indents the spinal cord and results in 50% narrowing of the spinal canal with slight indentation on the spinal cord.
Epidural metastasis on the right side of the spinal canal at T9 level displaces the spinal cord to the left side and results in slightly more than 50% narrowing of the spinal canal with moderate cord compression.
IMPRESSION: Bony metastasis to right pedicle and body of the L1 and superior portion of L2 vertebra as described above.
No evidence of epidural mass or spinal cord compression.
Osseous metastasis in multiple levels of the thoracic and lumbar spine as described above.
Uptake in some vertebrae might be related to degenerative changes but a differentiation cannot be made on the base of this study.
Osseous metastasis involving multiple bilateral ribs.
Osseous metastasis involving bilateral distal femora.
Increased uptake surrounding the femoral component of the right hip prosthesis in the right acetabulum likely related to post-operative changes.
On admission, he was started on dexamethasone, maintained on levonox fo prior history of pulmonary embolism and maintained in a TLSO.
CT exam also showed a T9 destructive lesion.
Also, bone scan showed evidience of mets at multiple levels of the thoracic and lumbar spine, ribs, and femurs.
On [**8-12**] bilateral pleural effusions were tapped by IR and on the following day the 2nd drain out was removed and he was extubated.
The patient had drainage from the JP site so a chest CT was obtained which did not show pleural or thoracic fistula.
On [**8-25**] thoracics was consulted and they determined that there was no indication for surgery since the pleural effusions were improved.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] placed new sutures over the area and by the next day ([**8-26**]) the site was completely dry the sutures need to stay in place until [**9-12**]  On [**8-24**] a sputum culture came bac positive for pseudomonas so Zosyn was started.
Mr. [**Known lastname 20598**] was treated for HSV 1 infection on his lips with acyclovir as well.
He was transferred to step down unit again on [**8-26**] but then to the MICU on [**8-28**] for lower GI bleed and melena.
Pt was transfused 1 U prbcs and underwent a colonoscopy which showed:Polyp in the ascending colon, Diverticulosis of the left > right, Ulcers in the distal rectum (biopsy.
He was transferred to the MICU service on two different occassions due to a GI bleed and atrial fibrillation.
Has had intermittent Afib in past, on amio for rhythm control as well as metoprolol.
There was concern for PE given the patient's history, but LENIs were negative.
Pt had another episode of rapid rates to 180s on the morning of [**9-3**] which transiently decreased with lopressor and resolved after 750 mL NS bolus.
# Hypoxemia.
There was intially concern for infiltrate on his CXR, so his Zosyn was continued until [**2160-9-4**].
- Also tried to wean sedating meds including neuroleptics and pain meds.
#Metastatic papillary CA: S/p recent T1-T12 palliative decompression and fusion on [**2160-8-7**] with known brain, bone and soft tissue mets.
# LGIB: In the setting of anticoagulation with Lovenox (60mg [**Hospital1 **]) for a history of PE in the past.
Ulcers on colonoscopy, bx showed no evidence of malignancy, but acute and chronic inflammation consistent with ulcer.
# Pseudomonas VAP: Pt with Pseudomonas in sputum from [**8-25**] and on Zosyn since [**8-23**].
10 day course extended until [**9-4**] given hypoxemia and concern for infiltrate on CXR.
# Delirium: Pt with history of delirium that began this admission.
# h/o PE: Pt with history of DVT/PE in [**2159-1-22**].
On anticoag at therapeutic dosing earlier during admit (when had GIB); also with history of hemoptysis presumably from lung mets; also known brain mets.
Given his recent GI bleed and hemoptysis we decided to use heparin sq only  #Thrombocytopenia: Plt count recovering from nadir of 38LK --> 89K, now 74K Unclear if thrombocytopenia was medication related.
On discharge Mr [**Known lastname 20598**] was awake, alert, orientated x3 comfortable with full strenght in his lower extremities, his wound was healing no erthyema.
He had low grade temps 99 range he had full work up given his complicated medical history.
