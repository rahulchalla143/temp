and pancytopenia   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Leukemia induction 3.
Central line placement  History of Present Illness: This is a 74 year-old woman with a history of breast and colon cancer, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and anemia (Hct 31-33), who presented to her PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) 191**] with shortness of breath, was put on supplemental oxygen, and then referred to the ED.
Of note, patient has a recent history of nose bleeds for two months associated with dizziness and sweating that was diagnosed as a sinus infection on [**5-7**].
Her PCP treated her with a course of Amoxicillin that developed into diarrhea and abdominal cramps.
Patient complains of dyspnea on exertion for the past couple of weeks that is associated with chest tightness, dizziness, and lightheadedness.
She experiences a dry cough, chest tightness, and heart palpitations with walking but denies radiating chest pain or dyspnea at rest.
Patient has developed a low grade fever of 100.0F that is easily abated with Tylenol.
Hospital course: In the ED, patient had a low grade fever of 100.4.
Her labs revealed a 15-point Hct drop and she was transfused 2 U PRBCs.
Breast cancer ??????
diagnosed in [**2174**] and treated by right mastectomy, chemo and XRT; she continues to be followed by her oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**], for annual check-ups.
Colorectal cancer ??????
Hypertension 4.
Hypercholesterolemia 5.
Anemia ??????
Osteoarthritis ??????
Low back pain .
She is the mother of 8 children with several grandchildren.
No conjunctival pallor.
No thyromegaly.
+ right mastectomy CV: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur.
No carotid bruits or jugular venous distension.
Abdomen: Soft, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses, no organomegaly.
Motor: Normal bulk and tone, no fasciculations, tremor or pronator drift.
CXR [**5-21**]: No pneumonia.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION PERIPHERAL SMEAR Smear quality is acceptable.
Myeloid cells appear increased, comprised primarily of blasts and microblasts, with moderately nucleoplasm, large prominent nucleoli, and some with Auer rods.
BIOPSY SLIDES The core biopsy contains periosteum on both ends indicating that it represents a tangential biopsy of the subcortical marrow space, which is frequently hypocellular and not representative.
The marrow space is comprised of fat and stromal cells and is devoid of maturing hematopoietic elements.
Minimal aortic stenosis.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
CT SINUS ([**5-26**]) IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute sinusitis.
Multiple gallstones as well as gallbladder thickening and possible stranding around the gallbladder.
If indicated, ultrasound or nuclear medicine gallbladder scan could be performed.
-B. Ill-definition and stranding around the head of the pancreas could represent pancreatitis.
-C. Small fat-containing ventral hernia (image 2, 29).
-D. Mild thickening of the sigmoid colon and rectum with stranding around it likely representing mild colitis.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**7-2**]): Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2183-5-23**], there is now a small pericardial effusion.
No overt evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or hydrocephalus.
Diffuse marrow space signal abnormality likely represents marrow replacement and may be related to patient's AML.
CXR ([**7-9**]): IMPRESSION: No pneumonia.
Mild-to-moderate degenerative changes of right hip and moderate-to-severe degenerative changes of left hip.
No acute fracture or osseous lesions.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 15063**] is a 74-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer s/p mastectomy, radiation and chemotherapy; colon cancer s/p hemicolectomy; and HTN who initially presented with SOB and was found to have pancytopenia (WBC 1.6, Hct 16.4, Plt 30) with a subsequent bone marrow biopsy consistent with AML.
She initially presented with SOB and pancytopenia (WBC 1.6, Hct 16.4, Plt 30, ANC were 390) to the medicine team on admission.
A bone marrow aspiration showed Acute Myeloid Leukemia with trisomy 11. .
Echocardiogram was done that showed normal LVEF >55%, minimal aortic stenosis, mild mitral regurgitation and Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Neutropenic Fever.
She was found to be neutropenic on admission.
She continued to have temperatures up to 100.5.
By [**2183-5-26**], with continued temperatures in this range, vancomycin was initiated to broaden coverage.
She also was complaining of sinus congestion and mild frontal headache at that time.
CT of the sinus was done which came back negative for sinusitis.
Vancomycin was discontinued after 72 hours and given a lack of other focal signs for infection, it was thought that her fevers might be related to her underlying hematologic malignancy.
Throughout her hospital course, she had intermittent low grade fevers.
Acyclovir was added for a herpetic ulcer in her mouth.
Meropenem was discontinued on [**7-4**] for a worsening rash and Cefepime was re-started.
Caspo was used for three weeks but was also stopped ([**6-29**]) for worsening rash.
Flagyl was started for diarrhea on [**6-24**], but stopped for her rash on [**7-2**].
Acute cholecystitis.
Ms. [**Known lastname 15063**] developed diarrhea on [**6-23**] along with mild upper abdominal pain.
A CT showed acute cholecystitis.
The suture staples were removed on [**7-10**] and the wound healed nicely after that.
Her pain was well controlled with oxycodone and acetaminophen.
Pain was adequately controlled PCA dilaudid.
She was also given Acyclovir for a herpetic ulcer on her right buccal muccosa.
The PCA was discontinued on [**6-21**] as her pain had decreased and WBC and ANC had increased.
However, given a persistently low bicarb, and a urinary GAP with low K+, it was more likely related to a renal tubular acidosis.
On admission, SOB was secondary to anemia (hct 16.4) admission, which improved after transfussion in the ED.
No evidence of heart failure on physical exam.
Further SOB on [**6-15**] was likely due to fluid overload; she got IV lasix 20mg x 1, and albuterol neb.
A LE Ultrasound was negative for DVT.
Although there was concern for pathologic fracture or osseous involvement, plain films revealed only degenerative changes consistent with her known osteoarthritis with no acute fracture, dislocation, or osseous lesion.
CXR on [**2183-6-4**] for a fever incidentally showed that the central line migrated back to the brachiocephalic vein.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 Puffs Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Call the BMT fellow on call if you develop fever greater than 101 degrees, shortness of breath, pain in the chest, nausea/vomiting, or any other symptom that is concerning to you.
