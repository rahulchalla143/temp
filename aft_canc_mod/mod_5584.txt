GI was consulted and a colonoscopy was done which showed a hepatic flexure mass, which on biopsy showed high grade dysplasia concerning for colon cancer.
After he received the ativan, he had acute worsening of his mental status becoming lethargic and a Code Stroke was called.
He had a stat CT and CTA of his head and neck which showed no evidence of acute stroke per the Stroke fellow.
Past Medical History: - Prior CVAs thought to be embolic from PFO (Multifocal stroke involving left Occipital, left Thalamic/IC [**1-/2145**]) - Hyperlipoproteinemia - EtOH abuse  Social History: Mr [**Known lastname 14738**] lives with his mother.
He has a sister who died from renal failure secondary to a kidney stone.
He reports no history of strokes of blood disorders in his family.
Physical Exam: VS: T:97.4; HR: 77; BP: 155/103; RR: 16; Sat: 99% RA Gen: WD/WN M in NAD CV: RRR, no m,r,g Chest: CTA Abd: Soft, nontender, nondistended, dermabonded midline surgical wound Ext: no c/c/e  Pertinent Results: [**2145-6-22**] 06:00AM BLOOD WBC-4.2 RBC-4.03* Hgb-9.0* Hct-30.6* MCV-76* MCH-22.4* MCHC-29.5* RDW-21.9* Plt Ct-470* [**2145-6-22**] 06:00AM BLOOD Glucose-122* UreaN-7 Creat-0.9 Na-139 K-3.6 Cl-106 HCO3-26 AnGap-11 [**2145-6-22**] 06:00AM BLOOD Calcium-8.8 Phos-2.4* Mg-2.0  CTA Head/Neck [**6-18**]: 1.
Little overall interval change from the complete CTA, performed only a week ago; specifically, the known predominantly left frontal deep "watershed" infarcts are not well-seen, with no evidence of acute vascular territorial infarction (though no dedicated CT-perfusion study was requested or performed).
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Unchanged appearance of high-grade stenosis of the proximal P2 segment of the left PCA, with preserved distal flow.
Diffuse atherosclerotic disease of the intracranial vessels, most markedly involving the superior division of the left MCA, as well as the hypoplastic A1 segment of the right ACA, with no new flow-limiting stenosis.
Unremarkable cervical vessels, with no flow-limiting stenosis.
Patchy airspace opacities involving the posteromedial lung apices, apparently new, which should be closely correlated clinically and with chest radiography.
ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT) Study Date of [**2145-6-25**] 10:52 AM IMPRESSION: Continued dilation of small bowel loops and air-fluid levels.
Dilated small bowel to level of the anastomosis.
No evidence of leakage or infection at anastomotic site.
Dilated colon distal to anastomosis with a second focal area of narrowing in the transverse colon.
Distal to the second narrowing, there again is dilated large bowel through to the rectum.
Findings are consistent with ileus or partial small bowel obstruction.
Free fluid in the pelvis and minimal perihepatic fluid.
Lung volumes are low but no focal airspace consolidation, pleural effusions, or pneumothoraces are seen.
A left perihilar opacity is less apparent on the current examination possibly related to differences in positioning or interval improvement.
No pneumothorax.
There is gas scattered throughout small and large bowel with some air-fluid levels on the upright study.
However, given worsening distention, early small bowel obstruction can not be entirely ruled out.
No free air.
Multiple calcifications in the pelvis are consistent with phleboliths.
Radiopaque material in the left lateral mid abdomen likely represents retained contrast in diverticula.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 14738**] was initially admitted to neurology on [**6-11**] for weakness and found to have an acute L cortical ischemic stroke.
He was found to be anemic with Hemoccult positive stool.
EGD was normal but on colonoscopy a 2-3 cm ulcerated, malignant appearing lesion in the hepatic flexure was seen.
His postoperative course was complicated by an acute mental status change in the PACU for which he was transferred to the ICU.
A stroke consult was obtained, CT and CTA imaging was obtained, neurology felt this to be likely of toxic/metabolic origin from anesthesia.
His course was further complicated by bilious emesis on POD2, an NGT was placed.
After restarting a regular diet, the patient's abdomen again became distended and he vomited.
In addition he was noted to have hypertension post operatively for which he was started on Lopressor and Lisinopril 5 mg daily.
The patient continued to have bowel movements and pass flatus despite being medically stable and have evidence of ileus on KUB.
The patient was assessed by the surgical team and it was thought that perhaps, the patient had an overgrowth of bacteria causing this ileus.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute Ischemic Stroke Right Sided Colon Cancer  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You have tolerated a regular diet, passing gas and having bowel movements and your pain is controlled with pain medications by mouth.
You have had multiple Xrays of your abdomen which showed this slowing as well as a CT scan which showed no [**Last Name 16423**] problem from the surgery.
It is believed that this slowing is related to am overgrowth of bacteria in your bowels and this will be treated with an antibiotic called Rifamixin which you will take for the next 10 days.
If you have any of the following symptoms please call the office for advice or go to the emergency room if severe: increasing abdominal distension, increasing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, inability to tolerate food or liquids, prolonged loose stool, or constipation.
You have a long vertical incision on your abdomen that is closed with sutures underneath the skin and dermabond glue.
Please monitor the incision for signs and symptoms of infection including: increasing redness at the incision, opening of the incision, increased pain at the incision line, draining of white/green/yellow/foul smelling drainage, or if you develop a fever.
Please call the office if you develop these symptoms or go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe.
You will be prescribed a small amount of pain medication.
Do not drink alcohol while taking narcotic pain medication or Tylenol.
