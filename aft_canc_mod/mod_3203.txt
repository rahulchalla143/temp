Admission Date:  [**2169-10-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-10-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2130-2-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ampicillin / Ancef  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**] Chief Complaint: hypoxia, seizure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation for airway protection   History of Present Illness: This is a 39 yom with h/o C5 quadriplegia, MDS, and recurrent UTIs who was transferred from OSH for assessment of altered mental status.
He returned to [**Location 620**] on [**2169-10-14**] with progressive weakness in his upper extremities and lethargy.
His temperature was "running low" but he had no fevers, chest pain, difficulty breathing, nausesa, vomiting, headaches, neck stiffness, head trauma or diarrhea but was having some mild cough and congestion.
Initial urinalysis was positive and he was started on ertapenem for presumed urinary tract infection.
He had a head CT which showed possible blood in the third ventricle.
On [**2169-10-15**], pt had a generalized tonic clonic seizure with hypoxia of 88% on RA.
There was concern for aspiration during this event secondary to increased secretions requiring deep suctioning.
EEG showed left mid to posterior temporal theta slowing.
On [**2169-10-17**] he had a second generalized tonic clonic seizure lasting one minute.
He was given IV ativan and subsequently was noted to have hypoxia to 85% on 4L nasal cannula and his respiratory rate was [**5-1**] with periods of apnea.
CPAP was tried, but hypoxia persisted.
Complicating his hospital course was a multifocal pneumonia noted on CXR, with low grade temps.
Pt is noted to have episodes of bradycardia associated with hypothermia.
ECG shows no apparent heart block.
He denies any discomfort with his breathing.
C4/C5 Spinal Cord Injury (17 y/a)due to MVA - can move arms slightly cannot move legs 2.
Seizure Disorder ('[**62**]-'[**63**]) 4.
Multiple past urinary tract infections including w mild UAs per [**Month (only) 116**] discharge summary, have included Klebsiella, ESBL E coli, enterococcus.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
Neck Supple, No LAD, No thyromegaly.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
0/5 wrists,  fingers and entire lower extremities.
vanc trough 34.1 [**10-15**] EEG:  This is an abnormal portable EEG due to intermittent left mid to posterior temporal theta slowing that, at times, appears monomorphic and more suspicious for epileptiform activity.
These  findings suggest possible subcortical dysfunction in this area.
[**10-15**] CT Head: CONCLUSION: No definite sign of an intracranial hemorrhage.
CONCLUSION: No definite sign of an intracranial hemorrhage.
[**10-17**] CXR (portable): Newly developed, slightly asymmetrical pulmonary edema with new right pleural effusion, which is small to moderately large .
Areas of apparent T2 hyperintensity in the right temporal lobe may be artifactual related to the patient motion.
If there is focal semiology and further clinical concern, repeat MRI of the brain as per the seizure protocol may be helpful if the patient is able to better tolerate the procedure without movement.
Fluid within the right mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses, improved since the prior study.
[**10-18**] CXR:  Previous mild pulmonary edema has resolved.
Opacification in the right lower lung and accompanied downward displacement of the hilus indicates that previous area of consolidation has now collapsed.
Pulmonary edema has resolved since [**10-17**].
Consolidation in the left lower lobe has worsened since [**10-13**] and could be another region of atelectasis or pneumonia.
There is a radiopaque object projecting over the upper neck that is most likely external but should be correlated clinically.
Compared to prior study obtained yesterday at 08:26 a.m. there is significant improvement in bibasal atelectasis and bilateral opacities consistent with resolution of the atelectatic process and decrease in pleural effusion.
There is still present left retrocardiac opacity that might represent infectious process or residual atelectasis.
No evidence of failure is present.
Brief Hospital Course: 39 yom with h/o C5 quadriplegia, MDS, and recurrent UTIs who was transferred from OSH for assessment of altered mental status and UTI.
Hospital course was complicated by HAP and tonic clonic seizures.
#Seizures/AMS:  On [**2169-10-15**], pt had a generalized tonic clonic seizure with hypoxia of 88% on RA.
EEG showed left mid to posterior temporal theta slowing.
On [**2169-10-17**] he had a second generalized tonic clonic seizure lasting one minute.
It was thought that the etiology of his seizure was infection (multifocal pneumonia noted on CXR, sputum positive for G+ cocci).
Blood cultures, urine cultures, and cerebral spinal fluid showed no growth.
Head CT and MRI were negative for acute process.
#Hypoxia/Pneumonia: Patient was hypoxic and apneic post seizure with evidence of multifocal pneumonia on CXR.
He was treated with vancomycin and aztreonam for his pneumonia.
#Bradycardia: Pt has history of HR ranging from 38 to 70 while in the MICU.
He did experience some light headedness but no chest pain or shortness of breath.
EKG was unimpressive, cardiac enzymes showed mildly elevated troponins which were consistent with past measurements.
No invasive measures were taken.
# Elevated troponin: Patient found to have trop of 0.25 when having bradycardic event.
#Hypernatremia: Could be due to dehydration in the setting of sepsis.
He continued to have fluctuating hypernatremia.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for evaluation after transfer from an outside hospital for symptoms of mental status confusion in the setting of a urinary tract infection.
A CT scan at the outside hospital showed a bleed in the head, but repeat imaging here showed no evidence of bleed.
During your hospitalization here, you were found to have a pneumonia.
You were transferred to the ICU for low oxygenation which after a day improved.
Medications changed during this hospitalizaiton include: --> You were started on dilantin due to active seizures.
--> Please continue to take keppra for seizure prevention --> You have three more days of IV antibiotics to treat pneumonia.
Pleae call your doctor or come to the Emergency Room if you develop shortness of breath, seizures, chest pain, bleeding, severe fatigue and weakness or any other symptom that concerns you.
