Admission Date:  [**2162-5-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2162-6-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2123-3-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: EMERGENCY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2565**] Chief Complaint: Fevers  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**Last Name (un) 1372**]-intestinal feeding tube placement   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 38598**] is a 39 year old patient with NHL s/p alloSCT [**2155**] and DLI [**2156**], in remission but with GVHD-associated bronchiolitis obliterans and severe restrictive lung disease who was recently admitted with fever, hypoxia and respiratory distress and discharged to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2162-5-19**].
He is now being readmitted from [**Hospital1 **] with low grade fevers for the past three days and a fever today to 101.2 in the setting of missing IV Colistin.
The patient had a prolonged hospital admission last month for pneumonia with multiple strains of highly resistant, elevated LFTs, and Left brachial DVT (for which systemic anticoagulation was not given for concern of recent GI bleed).
ID started him on both inhaled and intravenous colistin in addition to amikacin and he became afebrile with improved WBC count on this regimen.
He was noted to develop daily low grade fevers starting [**5-22**] to 100.2.
Otherwise there were no changes in his exam, no altered mental status, no increased coughing or production in sputum, no diarrhea, no urinary incontinence.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he was hypertensive and had sinus tachycardia to the 160s.
He denied shortness of breath or pain, but was requesting morphine to releive his work of breathing.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: - [**4-/2154**] p/w fevers, night sweats, and weight loss in the setting of a left inguinal lymph node.
- Bx grade II/III follicular lymphoma.
- Treated with six cycles of CHOP/Rituxan with good response, but showed evidence for relapse in [**12/2154**] and was treated with MINE chemotherapy for two cycles.
- Multiple GI bleeds requiring ICU admissions and multiple transfusions and embolization of his bleeding.
- Noted to have CNS lesions felt consistent with PTLD and this was treated with a course of Rituxan.
No evidence for recurrence of the PTLD.
- Acute liver GVHD, on CellCept, prednisone, and photophoresis.
- [**2157-12-28**] Photophoresis was d/c'd due to episodes of bacteremia and eventual removal of his apheresis catheter.
- [**2158-6-13**] restarted photopheresis on a weekly basis on , but then discontinued this again on [**2158-9-7**] as this was felt not to be making any impact on his liver function tests.
- undergone phlebotomy due to iron overload with corresponding drop in his ferritin.
He has continued with transient rises in his transaminases and bilirubin and has remained on varying doses of CellCept and prednisone which has been slowly tapered over the time.
- [**2159-1-19**] admission due to increasing right hip pain.
MRI revealed edema and infiltrating process in the psoas muscle bilaterally.
After extensive workup, this was felt related to an infection and required several admissions with completion of antibiotics in 03/[**2158**].
- [**7-/2160**]: Last scans showed no evidence for lymphom and he has remained in remission.
-In [**5-/2161**], noted to have tiny echogenic nodule on abdominal [**Year (4 digits) 950**].
MRI of the liver also showed this nodule but was not as concerning on review and he is due to have a repeat MRI imaging in early [**Month (only) **].
-On [**2161-8-3**], worsening cough and was noted to have a small new pneumothorax in the left apical area.
This has essentially resolved over time - Issues with weight loss (followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]); multiple tests done with no etiology found; question malabsorption related to GVHD - Has on and off respiratory infections and has been treated with antibiotics (now colistin inhaled and IV) for resistant pseudomonas.
Question underlying exacerbations of pulmonary GVHD in setting of his URIs.
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p allo SCT 2.
Grade 4 Acute GVHD of GI/liver following DLI with GI bleed, chronic transaminitis, portal HTN with esophageal varices (not able to band) 3.
History of intracranial lesions felt consistent with PTLD.
Hypothyroidism 8. hx of Psoas muscle infection   Social History: Smoke: never EtOH: none currently; occassional use prior to NHL dx Drugs: never Born in [**Country **] and moved to the U.S. for college ([**Hospital1 **]).
Family History: No lymphoma or other cancers in the family.
Father had CAD s/p PCI.
Physical Exam:  99.9 157 169/120 96% on ventilator Gen: Cachectic male (appears less so since last admission), +Trach present, + NGT small caliber, distressed due to suctioning of airway HEENT: sclera anicteric CV: Tachycardic, no m/r/g Pulm: coarse breath sounds bilaterally, no wheezes, crackles Abd: soft, NT, ND, bowel sounds present Ext: no peripheral edema   Pertinent Results: Microbiology [**2162-5-27**] URINE URINE CULTURE- negative [**2162-5-27**] BLOOD CULTURE Blood Culture, Routine-PENDING [**2162-5-27**] BLOOD CULTURE Blood Culture, Routine-PENDING [**2162-5-27**] STOOL CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST- negative [**2162-5-25**] MRSA SCREEN MRSA SCREEN-FINAL INPATIENT [**2162-5-25**] URINE URINE CULTURE-FINAL INPATIENT [**2162-5-25**] BLOOD CULTURE Blood Culture, Routine- negative [**2162-5-25**] 3:56 pm SPUTUM      Source: Endotracheal.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Imaging [**2162-5-25**] ECG Probable sinus tachycardia given patient's age but very rapid rate raises consideration of possible atrial tachycardia.
Slight ST-T wave changes are non-specific.
[**2162-5-25**] Chest Xray IMPRESSION: Persistent pulmonary abnormalities with some more prominent patchy infiltrates in the right upper lobe area.
Lateral pleural effusion also progressing slightly since next preceding study of [**2162-5-10**].
Collapsed gallbladder with slight wall thickening may be due to third spacing.
No biliary ductal dilatation.
Slight increased area of echogenicity within the left lobe of the liver, incompletely characterized.
Small amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
[**2162-5-28**] Lower Extremity Doppler CONCLUSION: There is no [**Month/Day/Year 950**] evidence of deep venous thrombosis of the right lower extremity .
Small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the left side, are stable.
Right upper lobe patchy opacities are unchanged as does bibasilar opacities, greater on the left side.
In the bases, the opacities could be a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.
This is most consistent with a hemangioma.
Differential diagnosis includes focal fatty infiltration.
Small amount of ascites and small right pleural effusion unchanged.
[**2162-5-31**] Upper Extremity Doppler IMPRESSION: DVT involving one of the left brachial veins.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 38598**] is a 39 year old man with NHL, s/p allo [**Known lastname 3242**] complicated by multi-organ GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans.
He is s/p trach and recent hospitalization for multi-drug resistant pseudomonas pneumonia.
# Fever:  On admission Mr. [**Known lastname 38598**] had low grade temperatures.
He was initially placed on vancomycin, but this was stopped shortly after arrival as there was no evidence of a gram positive infection.
Sputum grew pseudomonas strain that was less resistant than his prior pseudomonas.
His IV colistin and meropenem were stopped on [**2162-5-31**] and he remained afebrile until discharge.
# Ventilator dependent: Mr. [**Known lastname 38598**] initially had difficulty weaning off of the ventilator for even short periods of time.
# Acute renal failure: Had ARF with creatinine bump from 0.6 to 0.8.
# Elevated LFTs: Likely from GVHD of the liver.
RUQ on [**5-26**] showed no biliary obstruction, however did show area of hypoechoic liver that would be best characterized by CT, but due to fear of damaging kidneys with contrast he had a repeat [**Month/Year (2) 950**] that showed a stable lesion.
# Anemia: Hct stable.
No evidence of blood loss.
# Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated white count.
He had no further issues with his feeding tube.
# Tachycardia: EKG's showed a sinus tachycardia on admission.
# NHL s/p allo [**Known lastname 3242**] c/b GVHD ??????
GVHD is underlying cause for patient?????
?s liver dysfunction and bronchiolitis obliterans.
# Upper extremity DVT: Mr. [**Known lastname 38598**] was diagnosed with an upper extermity DVT on his previous admission ([**5-15**]).
The decision was made not to treat the DVT given his previous history of a significant GI bleed ([**2156**]).
It was decided to change him to once daily Fondaparinux 2.5 mg SubQ which is the lowest dose available given his low body weight.
# Prophylaxis: Mr. [**Known lastname 38598**] was continued on prophylactic doses of subcutaneous heparin until discharge when the decision was made to change his anticoagulation to fondaparinux as above.
