She was taken to the GI suite on [**2156-4-28**] for endoscopy which showed an "ulcerated mass with necrotic base highly suggestive of carcinoma" in the cecum.
She had a CT scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis to assess for metastasis and further define the tumor.
It confirmed colonoscopy findings and did not show evidence of metastasis.
There was 500 cc of estimated blood loss.Please refer to Dr.[**Name (NI) 3377**] operative note for further details.
After a brief stay in the PACU she was transferred to the floor but over the course of the night had low urine output, her blood pressure dropped to the systolic 80s/40s and her atrial fibrillation frequently took her heart rate to the 120s-130s.
She was transferred to the ICU given her extensive cardiac history and unclear etiology of her hypotension -- cardiogenic vs. septic.
She was continued on antibiotic coverage and the plan was for volume resuscitation with close monitoring of other aspects of her clinical picture.
She was asymptomatic and felt well throughout the process, though somewhat tired.
Remaining aspects of her hospitalization, by systems:  Neuro: No issues.
Pain controlled on a regimen of IV and PO medications when tolerating.
Cardiac: Multiple cardiac issues assessed by cardiology service preoperatively and which recommended continuing current care.
Multiple episodes of anginal chest pain relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin.
No EKG changes until POD 7 when chest pain was accompanied by questionable ischemic changes on EKG.
Her afib was monitored on telemetry and she was treated with 5 mg IV lopressor q6 hours when NPO and transitioned to 25 mg PO BID.
She did have some respiratory difficulty and increased oxygen requirement while in the ICU but this resolved after effective diuresis.
However, patient developed melenic stools and hematuria when heparin drip restarted.
All anticoagulation except aspirin was held and no further episodes of bleeding occured.
ID: Cipro/Flagyl initially post-operatively and dc'd on POD 7.
Afebrile throughout course.
[**Name (NI) 153**] Course Pt was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**5-1**] for management of hypotension and low urine output in setting of recent colectomy.
# Hypotension: Noted to be progressively hypotensive through today (POD1) with concern for hypovolemia however could also be related to evolving sepsis picture she is currently on cipro/flagyl since last night.
Given extensive cards history could also be cardiogenic shock related to missed event given her 500cc blood loss intraoperatively and prior hx of ischemic event in setting of blood loss in 01/[**2155**].
Given hx of recurrent UTIs (on home macrobid suppressive tx) could also be related to urosepsis.
Her UO improved to 20cc/hr but remained there with crystalloid boluses.
She was given lasix for volume overload XXXX.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and mildly elevated trop attributed to underlying CKD and possible demand ischemia [**2-18**] tachycardia on presentation.
# CAD: Extensive cardiac hx including recent NSTEMI [**1-/2156**] in setting of GIB and CVA at same time.
Increasing NSL use for her anginal equivalent altho per cards notes, outpt cards is not concerned for ischemic etiology.
Her home betablocker was held for hemodynamic monitoring.
She was noted to be in 100-130s afib with mild SOB but otherwise comfortable.
# CHF: Systolic EF 35% on TTE [**8-/2155**] and global LV hypokinesis.
Pleural effusion on AM chest xray and crackles on exam on transfer to the ICU.
# Cecal Mass: necrotic appearance on colonoscopy concerning for malignancy.
# CKD: unclear baseline but likely 0.9-1.1.
Creatinine elevated on admission.
Repeat urine lytes notable for FeNA = 0.1% indicating prerenal hypovolemic picture.
# COPD/ASthma: On home O2 via nasal cannula at baseline.
Unclear pulmonary disease hx.
Albuterol held for tachycardia and restarted on XXX.
Holding now for hemodynamic monitoring.
