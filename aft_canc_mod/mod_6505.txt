Subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall is improving.
There is persistent edema and atelectasis at the base of the residual right lung.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 80151**] was taken to the operating room by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2195-12-1**] for Right thoracotomy, right lower lobe sleeve lobectomy, anastomosis of right middle lobe bronchus to bronchus intermedius, intercostal muscle flap, therapeutic bronchoscopy, and mediastinal lymph node dissection.
He underwent bronch [**2195-12-7**] revealing sealed anastomosis site.
Right middle lobe secretions were aspirated.
The patient developed fevers, rigors, and tachycardia, but maintained blood pressure.
His chest tube was discontinued on [**2195-12-9**], but he continued to have persistent airleak out of the posterior chest tube.
He developed afib with RVR on [**2195-12-10**], treated with IV lopressor and eventually diltiazem gtt.
On [**2195-12-11**] he had bronchoscopy for worsened airleak and subcutaneous emphysema, revealing an anastomotic leak at 2oclock position.
His atrial fibrillation stopped after amiodarone drip and oral dosing.
He stabilized in the ICU and was transfered to the floor, where he then on [**2195-12-18**] was found to have persistent air leak secondary to a pinhole opening in the stoma.
He recovered on the floor, then on [**2195-12-24**] required another trip to the OR for re-do thoracotomy, lysis of adhesions, closure of bronchopleural fistula and reinforcement of closure withpericardium, thymic fat pad and intercostal muscle.
The patient did well after this last surgery, with two right sided chest tubes remaining, last pulled on [**2195-12-29**], with PA and Lateral CXR revealing normal fluid filling of the right lower pleural space on [**2195-12-30**].
He did have another 12 hour incident of atrial fibrillation on [**2195-12-27**] which resolved after amiodarone IV loading.
The patient had complaints of dysphagia early on which revealed air near the posterior wall of the pharynx, however this resolved and was most likely related to his anastomotic leak.
His complaints of tongue pain were evaluated mid hospital course by ENT, however nothing was found.
The patient was ambulating the halls, with controlled pain, and good urine output without constipation.
He was hemodynamically stable without fever and stable xray.
The patient was instructed to follow up cdif after the flagyl is complete with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] follow up with his cardiologist regarding his hx of atrial fibrillation.
