Admission Date:  [**2183-2-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2183-2-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2096-5-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4358**] Chief Complaint: CONFUSION  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 86M with a history of prostate ca, afib on coumadin, remote stroke, asbestos related lung disease on home O2, s/p sub-capsular orchiectomy for prostate ca recurrence on [**2183-1-20**] who was found by his wife lying in bed incontinent of urine with a complaint of abdominal pain.
Pt had a post-op urology visit on [**1-29**] and was in his usual state of health at that time.
He subsequently had two falls without loss of consciousness or head trauma on [**1-31**] and [**2-3**].
He attributes these falls to his severe back pain and chronic unsteadiness on his feet secondary to a movement disorder.
On [**2-4**] he didn't want to get out of bed and had decreased appetite.
He developed a cough on [**2-5**] productive of clear to white sputum, had ne episode of non-bloody nonbilious emesis, and became confused on the night of [**2-5**].
This morning ([**2-6**]) he compained of L sided abdominal pain and was found to have urinated in his bed, which he attributes to not having enough time to walk to the bathroom.
He was brought to OSH for the new abdominal pain and ongoing confusion, where he had a temperature of 100.3, and labs notable for WBC 18.4 with 83% PMN and 3% bands, a lactate of 2.0, and BNP 6421.
The OSH ED reported a 30 second tonic-clonic seizure, althogh the pt has a longstanding history of shaking all his extremities and head rhythmically in response to anxiety or pain.
CXR was read as possible RML infiltrate and pt received vancomycin, levofloxacin, and azithromycin at OSH ED.
Pt had a negative head CT and an abdominal CT showing L periaortic retroperitoneal fat stranding with a small amount of extraluminal fluid.
EKG: afib oneteens, no clear ischemia.
Reports chronic neck stiffness with extension but [**Last Name **] problem with flexion.
Denies diarrhea and constipation, reports that last BM was 2 days ago and normal in appearance.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Recent recurrence requiring subcapsular orchiectomy on [**1-20**].
- Pacemaker.
- Stroke in [**2148**] causing right facial weakness which mostly resolved with rehab, though he still notices a right-sided droop.
He believes the stroke was preceded one week before by a similar episode of right sided facial weakness that was transient and reversed.
- Chronic Lung Disease.
Pt used to work as a pipe fitter and had extensive asbestos exposure.

[**2-6**] CXR IMPRESSION: Findings suggesting mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
Non-displaced right-sided rib fractures although not necessarily acute.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
AORTA: Mildy dilated aortic root.
Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial MS.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PS.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
Moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2) is suggested.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Findings concerning for discitis of the L1-L2 vertebral body as well as osteomyelitis of the L2 vertebral body.
Compression fracture of the L2 vertebral body with involvement of the inferior endplate and bilateral pedicle fractures; concerning for instability.
Extensive retroperitoneal inflammation in the region of the aforementioned discitis/osteomyelitis, involving the adjacent abdominal aorta and left renal artery.
ADDENDUM: The complex, unstable fracture involving the L2 vertebral body, its superior and inferior endplates, and pedicles is present.
The previously seen gas in the disc and vertebral body are likely the result of vacuum phenomenon in the setting of degenerative and post-traumatic change.
Surrounding fluid-stranding in the retroperitoneum may actually represent post-traumatic hematoma, especially given that the superior endplate of L2 (except for the fracture) and inferior endplate of L1 are preserved, making a primary process of discitis/osteomyelitis less likely.
[**2-12**] CT HEAD IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Brief Hospital Course: 86M w/HX prostate CA s/p recent orchiectomy, Atrial fibrillation, and remote [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH in setting of AMS and a mechanical fall at home, treated for presumed urosepsis and PNA w/improvement in WBC and mental status to baseline AOX2, but found to have unstable L1 & L2 fractures requiring ongoing bracing, PT, and pain control.
# L1/L2 VERTEBRAL FRACTURES w/RETROPERITONEAL HEMATOMA Pt fell at home in his bedroom while walking unassisted to the bathroom in the early morning (usually uses a walker).
Direct impact to his mid-back on door frame, which corresponds to CT spine findings of fractured L1 and L2 vertebrae and corresponding spinal point tenderness on exam.
We note that pt's chronic LBP (unmedications and unbothersome for years) complicated initial evaluation of his back pain and he did not initially report a fall/back injury to his daughter or to medical personnel here.
However, back pain was clearly worse than prior and injuries seen on imaging corresponded with his history (once provided).
# CONCERN FOR VERTEBRAL OSTEOMYELITIS We note that, given initial CT spine read suggesting possible osteomyelitis/discitis/aortitis and initial lack of history of traumatic injury to his back, he was thoroughly evaluated by interventional neuroradiology, infectious disease, and neurosurgery teams for consideration of vertebral biopsy.
Coordinated re-review of final CT spine read by neuroradiology determined that all imaging findings could be explained by traumatic fracture + hematoma, not osteomyelitis (vertebral endplates not involved).
No biopsy was performed.
Patient will be seen in outpatient [**Hospital **] clinic with follow-up CT L-spine re-imaging to evaluate interval change in retroperitoneal hematoma.
# SEPSIS ON ADMISSION, FROM SUSPECTED URINARY SOURCE Febrile and hypotensive on admission, presumed septic.
No pressor requirement.
TTE was negative for endocarditis.
No cultures were ever positive here; OSH cultures also negative (finalized [**2-13**]); however, unable to determine from OSH records whether these cultures were drawn before or after antibiotics were started at the OSH.
# URINARY/FECAL INCONTINENCE Patient found incontinent at home in the setting of a fall.
Concern was for urinary tract infection initially.
Neurology evaluated the patient later during admission and felt his ongoing urinary incontinence was voluntary rather than involuntary - he urinated into his diaper due to anxiety/fear of pain he might experience getting OOB to walk to the bathroom or to sit up to use a urinal.
No saddle anaesthesia.
Neurology felt urinary incontinence and leg weakness may result from temporary RP hematoma compression of his spinal cord roots, which should resolved as hematoma resorbs.
No evidence of spinal cord infarct or compression seen on CT scan.
He will need neurologic re-evaluation if urinary incontinence and leg weakness worsen or persist.
# DELIRIUM Patient confused on arrival in the setting of sepsis; this resolved with antibiotics to treat his underlying process soon after arrival.
# PSEUDOSEIZURES Patient arrived w/hx of two ativan-responsive seizures at OSH and in-transit.
No change mental status/speech, nonfocal neuro exam during these episodes.
Neurology consult service evaluated him, reviewed records (including extensive outpatient neurology workup ~10 years ago including EEG monitoring and medication trials) confirmed prior diagnosis of pseudoseizure plus periodic limb movements of sleep, not actual seizure.
# Afib with RVR Longstanding history of afib, exacerbtation of tachycardia likely triggered by underlying infection during this admission.
Also on coumadin at home; this was stopped here given possible vertebral biopsy (as above), then restarted on [**2-12**].
#CHRONIC ASBESTOS-ASSOCIATED LUNG DISEASE On 2L home O2 throughout admission; slightly uncomfortable lying flat (unstable fracture precautions) but no SOB, no notable respiratory effort, no hypoxia, no cough.
# SYSTOLIC CHF, LVEF 55% Family does not report heart failure diagnosis but pt has cardiomegaly on CXR, mitral stenosis, afib, pacemaker, & takes daily lasix.
TTE shows mod-to-severe valvular heart disease but preserved LVEF ~55%.
No evidence of CHF exacerbation here.
# Troponin elevation Pt had a mild troponin elevation to 0.05 at OSH that was felt to be concerning for NSTEMI with no ischemic EKG changes, no symptoms.
After transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], his troponin leak was thought most likely demand ischemia in the setting of infection-related tachycardia.
No chest pain, no SOB here.
No EKG changes.
# DIARRHEA/LOOSE STOOLS Patient developed intermittent loose stools/diarrhea, which made him afraid to eat.
Pain control - monitor and adjust pain meds PRN.
Follow-up neurosurgery appointment (scheduled); please also re-eval for urinary incontinence and/or bilateral leg weakness during this appointment.
Monitor psedoseizure activity, frequency (arrange follow-up neurology evaluation with [**Hospital1 18**] Neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if this worsens or interferes w/care) 5.
10. oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for back pain.
12. lidocaine 5 %(700 mg/patch) Adhesive Patch, Medicated Sig: One (1) Adhesive Patch, Medicated Topical DAILY (Daily) as needed for hip or back pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Life Care Center of [**Location (un) 5165**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Mechanical Fall L1 and L2 vertebral fractures, unstable Sepsis from urinary tract infection Delirium Atrial Fibrillation Pseudoseizures  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes (oriented to self and hospital).
We think it came from a urinary tract infection.
You also developed a hematoma (large bruise) in the back of your pelvis near the fractures.
We are sending you without bowel medications because of recent loose stools, but they may need to start these at rehab if you become constipated.
