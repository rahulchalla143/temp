Ligation and division of the patent ductus arteriosus.
Intercostal muscle flap buttress to the left bronchial     stump.
Since then, he has noticed a decrease in overall stamina.
A chronic dry cough developed over this time, and he was started on PPI.
In [**11/2190**] continued complaint of cough prompted ENT evaluation.
Laryngoscopy demonstrated changes consistent with PND and he was started on a nasal spray, nasal wash and a course of antibiotics.
Subsequent contrast CT scan revealed a soft tissue mass arising within the left pulmonary artery, vascular occlusion and expansion highly suggestive of pulmonary artery sarcoma.
There was also extravascular extension and bronchial artery transpleural collaterals suggesting longstanding pulmonary artery obstruction.
PET/CT scan later demonstrated a lobulated low-attenuation FDG avid mass which occupies an experience of left main pulmonary artery and extends beyond its wall.
There was a new FDG avid left pleural effusion which developed over the 7-day interval since the CT scan suggestive of tumor spread.
On [**2191-2-24**], the patient underwent bronchoscopy and biopsy of the soft tissue mass, which revealed a spindle cell neoplasm with necrosis, likely malignant.
The profile was suggestive of a smooth muscle phenotype.
Corresponding cytology was also consistent with this diagnosis.
Patient presents now for operative resection.

PATHOLOGY: PENDING  Brief Hospital Course: Mr.[**Known lastname **] is a 66M with a recently diagnosed left pulmonary artery sarcoma admitted to the thoracic surgery service on [**2191-3-23**] following: cervical mediastinoscopy, left exploratory thoracoscopy, left thoracotomy and left pneumonectomy with pulmonary artery reconstruction, cardiopulmonary bypass, intercostal muscle flap buttress to the bronchial stump, mediastinal lymph node dissection, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage.
Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the CVICU intubated, sedated, on pressors, foley, Left chest tube and IV opoids for pain control.
Upon extubation, patient received percocet and IV morphine with good effect and adequate pain control.
He remained in sinus rhythm without ectopy.
Low-dose lopressor was started [**2191-3-27**] for tachycardia and increased to 25 mg tid on [**2191-3-29**] for HR 90-100.
Aggressive pulmonary toilet and nebs were initiated with oxygen saturations of 95-98% on 1-2L NC.
Serial CXRs were followed postoperatively to assess status of L thorax and aeration of R lung.
L thorax demonstrated expected fluid collection s/p pneumonectomy while R lung expanded well.
The patient's temperature was closely watched for signs of infection.
Prophylaxis: Initially postoperatively, DVT prophylaxis was held given concern for hemorrhage.
At the time of discharge on [**2191-3-31**] the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
