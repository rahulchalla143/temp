On [**2104-11-22**] the patient had a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis which showed massive ascites with omental caking compatible with metastatic disease.
Given the solid and cystic masses seen on the left adnexa this was felt to represent ovarian carcinoma less likely consideration would include metastatic breast cancer and bilateral Krukenberg tumors.
Pulmonary nodule seen in the right lung base worrisome for metastatic disease.
Left renal cyst.
5 mm nodule in lateral right lower lung.
Large amount of ascites associated with omental thickening consistent with abdominal carcinomatosis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2104-11-27**] the patient underwent an exam under anesthesia, exploratory laparotomy, total omentectomy, mobilization of the splenic flexure, supracervical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, resection of the rectosigmoid colon, creation of a colostomy, creation of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3379**] pouch.
The findings intraoperative showed a large omental caking extending from splenic flexure to hepatic flexure, frozen pelvis with large tumor encasing the rectosigmoid colon and a duplication of the right ureter.
NEUROLOGICAL - The patient was initially maintained on a Dilaudid PCA for pain relief.
The patient also given Tylenol for breakthrough pain.
PSYCHIATRIC  - The patient had a very negative affect and was extremely frustrated with her large surgery and diagnosis of the ovarian cancer as well as the need for an ostomy which she was not prepared for.
Prior to her admission the patient had been diagnosed with mild depression and had not started any medical therapy.
Her electrolytes were initially hard to manage with low potassium requiring a lot of potassium in her TPN but then her electrolytes stabilized and remained stable for the rest of her admission.

The patient still loses urine when she is unable to make it to the toilet but reports that she does have control of her bladder and this appears to be a functional incontinence.
The patient's urinary tract infection grew out pseudomonal as well as enterococcus which were sensitive to Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin therefore she was started on Levofloxacin po.
POSTOPERATIVE - The patient's incision remained intact without any signs of erythema or drainage.

She did have the mild coagulopathy and therefore was not given subcutaneous Heparin.
This was changed to Zantac in the TPN which could be changed to po after the TPN is weaned.
She is afebrile with stable vital signs.
Her pain is well controlled on po Dilaudid.
The patient's ostomy is working with positive gas and stool although slightly flush as some sloughing of epithelium.
