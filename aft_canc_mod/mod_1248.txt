PICC line placement   History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 6314**] is a 70 yo female with MMP, including CHF with EF 30-35%,including PEG tube for achalasia & esophagitis, osteoporosis c/b compression fractures, and pituitary adenoma s/p radiation (last treatment [**2161-5-26**]) who presented from rehab w/ lethargy and fatigue.
Patient is a poor historian and is only oriented to person and place.
Complains only of back pain which she reports having for months.
Per written records & pt's brother report, patient had MI on [**5-27**] with a CK-MB of 7.

She had low grade fevers ~99.8 and was reportedly more tired appearing, "less perky."
Again, pt w/o complaints.
Coronary artery disease with history of V. fib arrest, S/P LAD stent and repeat cath in [**10/2159**] The LAD had patent stnets with 50-60% proximal moderate instent restenosis.
and Left ventriculography demonstrated extensive anteroapical and inferoapical akinesis and aneurysm with a contrast calculated ejection fraction of 26%.

On the wards, pt found to have UTI (though UA notable only for [**3-16**] RBC & postive nitrites, only 0-2WBC).
Urine cx grew pansensitive Klebsiella & Stenotrophomonas sensitive to Bactrim.
She had low grade fevers ~99.8 and was reportedly more tired appearing, "less perky" but was without complaints.
In the MICU, blood cultures from [**6-12**] grew out pansensitive enterococcus as did her PICC tip.
Source of her bacteremia unclear.
She had intermittent hypoxia thought to be due to CHF and pulm edema which was responsive to prn lasix.
Also received short course of CPAP.
Also intermittent hypotension responsive to IVF and holding of BP meds.
Ddx sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock.
On [**6-14**], patient had an episode of increased RR, increased O2 requirement, hypertensive requiring NTG gtt, lasix, lopressor, and morphine.
EKG showed new TWI in inferior and precordial leads.
Treated with asa/plavix, heparin given h/o GI bleeding and Hct drop.
Received 1 unit PRBCs on [**6-15**] for Hct 21 w/ guiaic positive stools.
At approximately the same time, patient developed a new L facial droop.
Cardiology was consulted for NSTEMI and recommended medical management.
Repeat TTE showd worsening LVEF .
Neuro was consulted for L facial droop.
Carotid u/s negative for stenosis.
Neuro attributed to toxic metabolic derangements vs. watershed infarct but no further intervention entertained.
Today [**6-17**], received 20 mg IV lasix w/ brisk diuresis leading to tachycardia to 120s (baseline has been 90s-100s) which resolved back to baseline w/ 250 cc NS.
Back pain has also [**Last Name 19301**] problem throughout admission on multiple pain medications and lidocaine patch.
DDx includes sepsis, cardiogenic hypotension.
More likely cardiogenic given severely depressed EF.
Patient currently afebrile with fluctuating but currently improving Completed 7 day course of ceftaz/bactrim for UTI.
Also unlikely adrenal insufficiency given random [**Last Name (un) 104**] of 21 ([**6-9**]).
She had no further evidence of ischemia following event and remained stable throughout remainder of course.
Tenuous volume status intermittently requiring lasix and IVF to manage hypotension in the ICU.
Upon arrival to the floor, patient's volume status remained stable and only intermittently required small NS boluses for poor po intake and low SBPs into 80s (although always asymptomatic).
She remained tachycardic in the low 100s.
However, this was presumed necessary to augment her cardiac output given her poor stroke volume so there was no increase in her beta blocker dose made.
She should follow up with her outpatient cardiologist as scheduled and may benefit from evaluation by EP for potential AICD placement.
It was noted that she could benefit from anticoagulation given her LC aneurysm but given her history of GI bleed and guiaic positive stools in house, this intervention was not pursued.
Concerning given hypotension on previous day.
MRI showed R frontal lobe punctate lesions the chronicity of which could not be determined.
It was thought that these could potentially be acute, but as above, GI bleeding precluded anticoagulation and she was already on antiplatelet therapy.
# Anemia- Chronic Fe deficicient anemia, likely from chronic GIB.
No active bleeding currently on asa, plavix but did continue to be intermittently guiaic positive.
# Lethargy and fatigue: Likely multifactorial with combination of pain medication, metabolic derangements including hyponatremia and infection with UTI/bactermia.
# depression: No active issues.
# Pituitary Adenoma- completed radiation on [**5-26**].
No focal deficits.
Neuro exam was unchanged except for facial droop as above and there were no other significant changes noted on MRI.
Diet advanced without evidence of aspiration despite achalasia.
# Code- DNR/DNI .
Miconazole Nitrate 2 % Powder [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Appl Topical [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for rash at PEG site.

Congestive Heart Failure 5. anemia  Secondary: 1. coronary artery disease 2. pituitary adenoma 3. achalasia 4. hypertension 5. compression fractures   Discharge Condition: Vitals stable.
You were found to have a urinary tract infection as well as a blood stream infection that were treated with antibiotics.
You also had a small heart attack during your admission which was treated with medications.
Your fentanyl patch has been replaced with Tylenol and oxycodone as needed to help prevent low blood pressures.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, abdominal pain, or any other concerns.
