There is a moderate-sized right pleural effusion obscuring the right hemidiaphragm and right heart border with adjacent consolidation.
TTE ([**6-29**]):  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40%), possibly in part secondary to tachycardia.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
No vegetation is seen on the mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation.
Mild global left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Diffusely echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
However, other forms of diffuse liver disease including significant fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
Right pleural effusion, without right upper quadrant ascites.
CTA CHEST ([**7-1**]): There is a small-to-moderate right pleural effusion with areas of loculation.
An area of consolidation is seen within the left lung base (3, 62).
Multiple scattered mediastinal lymph nodes are identified, none of which meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
There is no axillary lymphadenopathy identified.
There are no definite filling defects within the main pulmonary arteries or proximal segmental branches.
Multiple pulmonary nodules are identified particularly in the right lobe (3, 33), (3, 44), and (3, 47).
There is no pericardial effusion identified.
Multiple subpleural blebs and emphysematous changes are noted.
CT CHEST ([**7-5**]): There has been interval decrease in a small-to-moderate partially loculated right pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
Consolidation in the left base has almost completely resolved.
Small areas of atelectasis in the right middle lobe and adjacent to the pleural effusion have decreased.
There are no new lung abnormalities.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mediastinal lymph nodes measure up to 10 mm in the subcarinal stations.
Right hilar lymphadenopathy measures up to 20 mm.
PLEURAL TISSUE Acute, chronic, and granulomatous inflammation with focal necrosis.
Brief Hospital Course: 44 year-old woman with history of EtOH dependence who presented with EtOH intoxication hypoxic respiratory distress.
#Hypoxic respiratory distress:  She initially presented with hypoxic respiratory failure and a 6L oxygen requirement.
Her pleural effusion was tapped and showed an exudative process, likely parapneumonic effusion from previous pneumonia as bronchiectasis was seen on CTA chest.
CTA chest also showed a LLL consolidation and no evidence of PE.
Pt was initially started on levofloxacin and Unasyn to empirically cover for aspiration and community-acquired pneumonia.
There was a question of whether the effusion could be related to CHF.
Liver US showed fatty infiltrate and no ascites.
The pleural effusion re-accumulated and she had repeat R-sided [**Female First Name (un) 576**] on [**7-5**] with 800 cc serous fluid removed, consistent with exudate.
Patient returned the day after surgery to the medical floor with a temperature overnight of 104, tachycardia and hypotension.
She became hypotensive that morning and returned to the MICU for stabilization.
Three concentrated respiratory sputum samples were negative for acid fast bacilli as of [**2131-7-17**], however, given her exposure and clinical picture, the patient was started on empiric weight bases therapy prior to her discharge from [**Hospital3 **].
# Pleural TB: The patient has presumed pleural tuberculosis, for which she is currently being treated with multi-drug therapy.
The patient had a baseline ophthalmologic eye exam while in the hospital, which was normal.
# Pain control:  The patient was in pain secondary to her chest tubes, the last of which was removed yesterday with no evidence of pneumothorax on x-ray.
When her pain is better controlled, please consider discontinuing the Tylenol as well as titrating down the morphine when able.
# Fevers: The patient has had cyclical fevers since admission, which have been trending down.
Initially she was treated with levofloxacin and Unasyn to cover for aspiration and community-acquired pneumonia.
Her liver US demonstrated fatty infiltrate but was unable to completely rule out underlying cirrhosis, no ascites.
By transfer to the medical floor, she was still exhibiting signs of withdrawal including anxiety, tremulousness, and tachycardia but improving.
#?Tricyclics OD: Pt did not have EKG changes suggestive of tricyclic overdose nor anticholinergic side effects like dry mouth or dilated pupils.
# Acute systolic CHF:  ECHO showed EF of 40%, 3+ MR, possibly [**3-17**] to ETOH cardiomyopathy.
Post-VATS operation, she likely became hypotensive (to 80's) and most likely from the inflammatory response to surgery, aggressive post-operative pain control, and sub-optimal systolic output.
Upon re-admission the the medical floor, the patient has had no crackles or examples or other indications of volume overload even with fluid replacement (up to 1 L/day at 100ml/hr) to aid with ARF.
# Sinus tachycardia: This was likely multifactorial, due to infection, fevers, ETOH withdrawal, and anxiety.
CTA chest showed no PE.
Currently, patient is no longer tachycardic.
# Acute Renal Failure:  The patient had a rise in her creatinine (peak 1.8) on [**7-11**]/3008 when she had episode of hypotension and was sent back to the MICU.
Her labs demonstrated a combination of pre-renal and ischemic ATN at that time.
# Thrombocytosis: Since admission, the patient's platelet count rose significantly peaking in high 900,000 range and rose rapidly around time of VATS surgery.
# Anemia: The patient has an anemia which is likely her baseline.
Her iron studies appear consistent with anemia of chronic disease/inflammation.
Please continue to follow a weekly CBC to monitor for stability of her hematocrit.
# General Anxiety Disorder:  She was initially on a CIWA scale receiving large quantities of Valium.
When this was discontinued she was transitioned to Ativan 0.5 mg TID prn, which controlled her anxiety well.
# Pulmonary nodules:  This was seen on chest CTA.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Pyrazinamide 500 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO DAILY   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 2222**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: # Alcohol withdrawal # Pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion # Urinary tract infection # Acute renal failure  Secondary: # Anemia # Depression/anxiety # Cardiomyopathy   Discharge Condition: Patient is 8 days s/p thorascopy.
Pain is adequately controlled on her current medication regimen.
You were treated for alcohol withdrawal with medication and the pneumonia with antibiotics.
You were found to have a urinary tract infection which was treated in conjunction with your pneumonia.
You had a thoracoscopy to help treat your pleural effusion and diagnose it.
You were treated for hypotension and acute renal failure which you recovered from acutely.
You were diagnosed with tuberculosis in your pleural space.
You are being treated with multiple medications.
You were diagnosed with an anemia which is likely due to your ongoing infection.
You will be transferred to [**Hospital **] Hospital where you can continue your recovery including getting your pain and tuberculosis medications.
At the point at which you are fully discharged from medical care, please come back to the hospital if you have chest pain, shortness of breath, temperature of > 101 or any new symptom that is concerning to you.
Pulmonary nodules were seen on your CT scan on [**2131-7-1**] so we recommend that you have a repeat CT scan in 3 months from that date to follow-up.
