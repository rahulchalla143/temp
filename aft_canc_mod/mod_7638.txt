Admission Date: [**2104-6-23**]        Discharge Date: [**2104-7-6**]   Service:  CME   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83-year-old male with a complex cardiac past medical history notable for CAD status post CABG in [**2094**] and MI in [**2103**] with ventricular fibrillation arrest, CHF with EF about 30 percent, PAF, CRF, followed in the [**Hospital 1902**] Clinic by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2031**] with chronic decompensated CHF poorly responsive to outpatient diuresis and recently worsening CRF, now admitted with approximately a three-day history of worsening dyspnea on exertion.
Noticed increased face and leg swelling for as long as 15 days and mild dyspnea on exertion.
No recent illnesses, fevers, or chills.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  CAD status post MI in [**2103**].
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Ventricular fibrillation arrest in [**2103**].
Right renal mass.
Lungs:  Few crackles left base greater than right base.
No splenomegaly.
Extremities:  Chronic stasis changes; 1 to 2 plus pitting, symmetric edema to knees bilaterally.
Lasix was held given elevated creatinine.
While the patient had an intermittent stay in the CCU for rapid atrial tachycardia, on discharge from the CCU, he was continued on Natrecor with Lasix boluses and was able to be diuresed further and on discharge was felt to be at his baseline in terms of dry weight with improved JVD, though never completely improved (thought to be secondary to patient's tricuspid regurgitation).
The patient had a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, but was in regular sinus rhythm through the early part of his admission.
Coumadin was given for an INR goal of 2.5 to 3.5, though he was supratherapeutic on admission and it was initially held.
On [**2104-6-29**], the patient was found by the ninth floor to be in rapid atrial tachycardia with a heart rate of 120s, initially thought to be atrial fibrillation.
Because of the hypotension and rapid atrial rate, which continued even after the Lopressor, the patient was transferred to the CCU.
Etiology of the patient's hypotension was thought to be rate related, also from possible sepsis as the patient was found to have a UTI.
Coronary artery disease.
The patient was without chest pain until his transfer to the CCU when he did experience chest pain, which was nonradiating with any minimal exertion.
In addition, the patient is known to have severe three-vessel disease, but it was decided that medical management would be the best way for treating the patient's known coronary artery disease given his many comorbidities.
After transfer to the floor, the patient was able to be switched to Imdur for his anginal pain and really was without further pain on the floor.
The patient was found to have a urinary tract infection in the CCU, which was probably related to instrumentation.
The urinary tract infection grew Citrobacter and Enterobacter.
The patient has a known renal cell carcinoma that is seen on CAT scan.
The patient required two units of blood on [**2104-7-3**] for a slowly dropping hematocrit, though the patient remained guaiac negative.
He was noted, on [**2104-7-3**], to have some abdominal tenderness and a hard mass in his abdomen.
A CT without contrast showed a rectus sheath hematoma and this was thought to be the site of the patient's blood loss.
On the floor, the patient had peripheral IV access, but in the CCU, the patient required a right EJ to IJ line.
This was done without complications and was discontinued on [**2104-7-4**] with some bleeding, which was controlled with pressure.
Coronary artery disease.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Urinary tract infection.
