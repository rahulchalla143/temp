There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and overlying right base atelectasis.

CT head [**2-6**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 39760**] is a 76 y/o F with history of autoimmune hepatitis, diastolic CHF, hypertension, T2DM, as well as abdominal B cell lymphoma recently diagnosed by ex lap in [**Month (only) 1096**], who presents with fever, abdominal pain, hypotension, confusion and AF with RVR and was found to be in neutropenic sepsis with initial shock requiring pressor support.
She had s aureus in 3 sets of BCs and this was felt likely due to an infected CVC.
She had gross anasarca and ascites drained from her abdomianl wound which was reviewed by surgerya nd eventually was treated with a wound vac.
# Neutropenic sepsis with shock: The likely sourec was line infection due to an indwelling RIJV CVC through which she had been receiving TPN at rehab.
Patient was admitted in neutropenic sepsis, fulfilling SIRS criteria with tachycardia, high RR, fever and neutropenia.
Initial imaging was pertinent for a negative head CT, Abd CT which showed small BL pleural effusions, ascites, RLQ mass, new LUL opacity, and ?
atelectasis in the RLL and a CXR which showed R base atelectasis, and L base opacification.
She was therefore treated broadly with IV cefepime, vancomycin and metronidazoel t cover possible abdominal source.
Further BCs revealed no further growth.
She was treated with GCSF for her low ounts in the setting of her sepsis.
She was initially less responseive and confused on admission and this improved as her counts improved and her infection was treated.
Due to teh likely source of her infection being her CVC, she had a new central line placed [**1-11**].
She had no further fevers but she continued to have episodes of hypothermia down to 95F.
Give the presence of a high grade s aureus bacteremia, she proceeded to a TTE on [**1-14**] which showed no evidence of vegetations, moderate MR and a normal EF.
Given her rebounding WCC cefepime was stopped on [**1-15**] and metronidazole was stopped when there seemed little evidence of an abdominal source for her sepsis and after surgical review although it was latterly restarted on [**1-18**] when she was no longer neutropenic in the setting of loose stools to cover for psossible c difficile.
She had profound ascites and this was began to profusely drain from her abdomen at the start of her [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU stay.
Her abdominal wound had areas without skin closure (although fascial planes were closed) and her draining ascites as initially treated with wound bag and latterly after surgical review with a wouund vac.
After initial rehydration and pressors stabilised her BP she was not given further excess hydration and she was diuresed with an IV furosemide infusion and her edema improved.
Her K was aggressively repleted and did not develop a contractin alkalosis.
# Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  Patient had a hx of chronic AF in the past on prior [**Hospital1 18**] admission and was previously controlled on oral metoprolol to good effect.
She had been anticoagulated with fondaparinux given a questionable episode of thrombocytopenia in the context of her chemotherapy but this was held in the setting of her thrombocytopenia post R-CHOP.
Her rapid rate was felt likely secondary to her neutropenic sepsis and was difficult to control.
She was chanegd to oral amiodarone and initially required intermittent IV metoprolol boluses for episodic tachycardia.
Given little evidence for HIT and negative PF4 Ab on the advice of BMT she was started on enoxaparion at treatment dose 100mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**1-17**] with fXa level monitoring at which point her platelets were >50.
# Abdominal B cell lymphoma:  Diagnosed with pathology, cytology, and flow consistent with a B cell lymphoma.
She was treated as above for her neutropenic sepsis with broad spectrum antibiotics.
She had considerable mouth ulcers and these were treated effectively with lidocaine/Maalaox mouthwash.
Rising LDH was suspicious for returning abdominal lymphoma.
# Diarrhea: Several episodes of loose stool [**1-18**] with elevated WBC which was likely secondary to her GCSF therapy.
#Hypoxia:  Patient has history of underlying COPD lung disease of unknown severity and also had evidenec of effusions with atelectasis obn her initial CT imaging.
Her stay was complicated by inability to fully sit upa nd hence at very high risk fpor worsening atelectasis.
Despite severe fluid overload, she had no significant pulmonary edema.
She received a steroid taper as part of her AIH treatment.
# Pain control: Pt has a history of significant delirium with even small doses of opioids and family requested that pt not be given any narcotics.
There was no propr histopry in teh community of this as she had not been treated with opiates until her recent treatment at [**Hospital1 18**].
Pt has a known history of low pain tolerance and many pain complaints but only tylenol was used duringh her stay in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to patient and family preference.
# Leukocytosis: She developed a rebound leucocytosis on regaining her counts whilst on GCSF.
This was felt likely secondary to GCSF, but she did have episode sof diarrhea and she was evaluated for possible c difficile.
She was presumptively treated with oral metronidazole from [**1-18**] given her loose stools and at the [**Last Name (un) 39762**] of writing, 1x c difficle toxin was negative and further sample is pending.
# Nutrition: Patient had poor po intake and had been on TPN in rehab for her poor nutritional status.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], her Alb was 2.7 (2.3 at lowest value) and given initial pain due to oral ulcers and concerns for starting TPN on a line inserted while bacteremia, TPN was initially held.
# Diabetes Type II: Pt has a history of DM II and received insulin treatment at home.
She displayed increased needs in the context of infection and steroids.
# Autoimmune hepatitis: Patient received no further azathioprine in setting of neutropenia.
She was reviewed by GI who felt that her disease was not currently active.
She was initially treated with stress dose steroids for her neutropenic sepsis and then a prednisone taper to conclude with 10mg each day x3 days; 5mg PO x3 days; 5mg PO QOD x4days then off.
# Elevated LFTs: LDH was noted to be increasing to 436 and patient was without complaints.
There was nno evidence of transaminitis.
Etiology was felt possibly due to progression of lymphoma or drug effect of her antibiotics.
An initial CT showed ascites without evidence of biliary tree dilatation and normal liver.
U/S abdomen on [**1-11**] showed moderate ascites and otherwise a limited but normal exam.
She was reviewed by hepatology who felt that hyperbilirubinemia was likely unrelated to her AIH, and more consistent with hyperbilirubinemia of sepsis and in addition, infiltrative disease from lymphoma can present with an obstructive LFT picture.
# GERD: Pt has a history of hiatal hernia and accompanying GERD which caused significant intermittent abdominal discomfort.
# Pressure ulcers: Patiemt has evidence of pressure ulcers and blisters.
She was prescribed a First step mattress and had a wound care consult.
The patient remained grossly fluid-overloaded, but still probably dry intravascularly, as evidenced by low urine output.
Her fluid overload was so egregious that she began to develop weeping bullae on her extremities and abdomen, yet still required pressors and boluses in order to produce urine.
Significant loading of amiodarone was attempted, along with occasional IV pushes of diltiazem or metoprolol.
# Septic shock: Worsening leukocytosis with increasing pressor requirement and a variety of possible sources.
Paracentesis yielded SBP without organisms (so CNNA).
Patient had bilateral pleural effusions and consolidations.
CT pan-scan showed no obvious site of infection.
# Respiratory failure: Multifactorial, including underlying chronic pulmonary hypertension, bilateral pleural effusions and consolidations, possible restrictive ventilation secondary to ascites, fluid overload from hypoalbuminemia.
Occasional IV pushes of metoprolol and diltiazem were also tried, with little success.
Digoxin not tried because of kidney injury.
# Acute kidney injury: Possible etiologies included contrat nephropathy, allergic interstitial nephritis, or most likely, ATN from hypotension.
