gentleman with CAD (s/p CABG '[**46**]), multiple PCI, ICM (EF 30%) with known restrictive lung disease (on 3L home O2), anemia presented from [**Hospital3 24768**] (where he presented with ?
PNA with progressive dyspnea) for evaluation for acute coronary syndrome with elevated CK but flat TN.
When he arrived he was in marked pulmonary edema improved with diureses.
No known dietary indiscretion or med changes.
No pre-syncope.
CAD s/p CABG'[**46**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM2, SVG to diag, SVG to PDA), s/p PTCA/stent LMCA to D1 [**7-18**], plaque prolapse s/p restent [**10-18**], instent rethrombosis during stent, repeat stent Cath [**6-18**]: PTCA/stent SVG to OM1, repeat cath [**6-18**] stent of LMCA, LAD, D1 (not CABG candidate).
Restrictive lung disease, on [**3-20**] L home o2 ([**3-19**] diaphragmatic injury during thoracotomy, also component of OSA) 4.
Hyperlipidemia 5.
DM 6. s/p CVA [**2142**] 7.
Pulm: Rales b/l 1/2 up ABD: S/NT/ND  No bruits Ext: 1+ DP/radial b/l Neuro: Motor [**6-19**].
Pertinent Results: AP portable chest [**2155-4-6**] at 8:40 a.m.:  No apparent change in the position of the left subclavian central venous catheter whose tip is in the left brachiocephalic vein.
There is opacity at the right cardiophrenic angle, which appears increased when compared to prior study, but this may be secondary to lesser inspiration.
The patient is in mild failure.

ACS w/ elevated CKs, but flat troponins.
Marked cardiogenic pulmonary edema, hypotensive (responded to fluids) on arrival that improved w/ diuresis.
EVENTS: [**2154-4-2**] = Patient became hypotensive w/SBP in 60-70s wtih some response to fluid boluses.
EKG was unchanged, but cardiac enzymes were cycled and CK were mildly elevated.
A potential septic workup was initiated as a source of the hypotension w/ CXR (?
Additionally, patient has been complaining of increasing pain secondary to his prostate cancer.
We increased his morphine to 2-4mg from 2mg, however [**Month/Day/Year 2449**] have been informed to give judisciously if signs of respiratory depression/somnolence.
Received central line secondary to non-functional peripherals and possible need for future fluid boluses/reliable line.
At end of day, developed substernal chest tightness w/increased depression on lateral leads.
Selective coronary arteriogram of this right dominant system revealed angiographic evidence of three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had mild diffuse disease.
The first diagonal branch had a focal 95% instent restenosis distally.
The LCX had moderate diffuse disease throughout its course with a totally occluded lower pole OM1 filling with collaterals.
Graft angiography revealed a patent LIMA->LAD and a patent SVG->OM2.
Final angiography revealed 30% residual stenosis, no dissection.
The chest pain was thought to be demand ischemia in the setting of pneumonia and anemia.
______________________________________________________________  ## DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: volume overload on exam.
Echo ([**4-1**]) with EF 25% (see data) with mild pulm HTN and 1+MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] had been on toprol xl 200 daily, changed to metoprolol 50 po bid.
Complex mulitvessel disease.
No episodes of Chest pain.
Deconditioning/edema / ?myositis / pain syndrome.
-PT eval once pulmonary condition improves and additional volume removed.
-Will monitor CK on statin - No fevers x 48 hours at time of D/C.
Urine cultures NTD ___________________________________________________________ ## DYSPNEA: probably mostly related to decomp HF on top of underlying restrictive lung disease (home O2 baseline 3liters) and ?
Apparently had febrile illness prior to admit to [**Hospital 11047**] hospital.
given poor po (which may also reflect the degree of pulm edema +/- carcinoma), will undershoot dose and uptitrate as needed.
Anemia of chronic disease (due to prostate ca)  Hct on D/c 30.8.
- xfuse PRBC today - dose with procrit ____________________________________________________________ ## PELVIC DISCOMFORT: robable bladder spasm [**3-19**] foley catheter -UA neg, UCx pending -increased oxybutinin to 10mg today, monitored for anticholinergic side effects -On duragesic patch with prn morphine ______________________________________________________________ ## PAIN SYNDROME: related to bony pain from prostate ca.
Will offer prn morphine and calculate narcotic requirement and then dose duragesic appropriately.
## Occasional Hypotension: Initially thought to be sepsis vs. CHF.
Afebrile with negative blood cultures.
