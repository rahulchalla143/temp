Initial symptoms were worsening shortness of breath.
CT showed large mediastinal mass with compression and left upper and lower lobe occlusion; patient taken to IP for attempted stenting.
The procedure long and complicated due to extensive tumor burden and narrowing of distal trachea with occlusion of both main-stems.
IP was unable to place a Y-stent but placed a metal stent in the distal trachea and a 12mm stent in the left mainstem with subsequent visualization of the left lower airways.
There were no PACU events.
On the floor, she feels short of breath and wheezy, worse compared to prior to the procedure.
She has a new cough with brown sputum production.
She has no other complaints.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

There is subtotal collapse of the left lung with complete opacification of the left hemithorax.
At the right lung base, mild-to-moderate parenchymal opacities suggesting chronic aspiration are seen.
Increased narrowing of the trachea inferior to the tracheal stent to 5mm in AP dimension, which further narrows to 1.5 mm in AP dimension with expiration.
Improved aeration of the left lung with persistent opacities consistent with infection and/or radiation change.
New right basilar opacities consistent with infection and/or aspiration.
Fluid in the esophagus, placing the patient at risk for aspiration.
There is subtotal collapse of the left lung with complete opacification of the left hemithorax.
At the right lung base, mild-to-moderate parenchymal opacities suggesting chronic aspiration are seen.
CXR [**11-30**] (post procedure, prior to transfer to ICU) Peristent collapse of left lung/opacification of left hemithorax, R lung clear, maybe some increased pulm vascular congestion on R  Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo female with a history of COPD and small cell lung cancer s/p chemo and XRT who was admitted on [**11-28**] for a scheduled placement of a tracheal stent complicated by migration of the tracheal stent and repeat IP procedure with creation of a piece-meal Y stent now stable and being called out of the MICU.
# Small cell lung cancer:  The patient had a CT on [**11-24**] showing compression of the distal trachea and was admitted for monitoring after her initial bronchoscopy where she had tracheal and left mainstem stents placed.
She had hypoxia after the procedure which has stabilized with diuresis and with her sedation wearing off.
# Hypoxia:  Likely secondary to underlying COPD and lung collapse from compression of her trachea.
# Hx of back injury:  Her pain was well controlled on her home regimen of oxycodone 5-10 mg PO/NG Q4H:PRN.

5. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Tessalon Perles 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO every four (4) hours as needed for cough.
Disp:*50 neb* Refills:*2*  Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 2203**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: - Small cell lung carcinoma causing tracheal compression status post multiple stent placement  Secondary diagnoses: - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - Back pain  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Unfortunately one of the stents moved causing you to feel short of breath so you underwent another bronchoscopy where the stent was repositioned and an additional stent was placed to your right main stem bronchus.
Medication changes: START guafenesin 1200 mg twice daily You can take tesselon pearles as needed for cough.
