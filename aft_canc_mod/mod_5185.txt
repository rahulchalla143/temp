Mildly swollen ill-defined body and tail of the pancreas consistent with acute pancreatitis.
Low-attenuation enlarged periportal lymph nodes consistent with metastatic involvement which appear to produce mass effect upon the pancreas.
No pancreatic duct dilatation or ductal calcified stone identified.
Large heterogeneously enhancing lesion within the distal esophagus with luminal narrowing consistent with patient's known esophageal cancer.
Noncalcified pulmonary nodule within the right lung base measuring 1.1 cm, worrisome for metastatic disease.
Distended gallbladder without wall thickening or edema consistent with fasting state.
Pathologically enlarged paraaortic and periportal lymph nodes identified on recent PET-CT to show increased FDG avidity consistent with pathologic involvement.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or enhancing intracranial lesions.
Brief Hospital Course: 63 yo M with metastatic esophageal ca pw dysphagia, abdominal pain, and elevated lipase.
#Abdominal pain with (mildly) elevated lipase: The patient has known metastatic disease to pancreas seen on PET scan in [**Month (only) **].

ERCP felt not to be necessary as there was no pancreatic duct dilation.
Patient treated with oxycodone and oxycontin for pain control.
