Though patency of the subclavian, axillary, and brachial veins is identified, there is loss of phasicity involving the left subclavian vein which would suggest a more central high-grade stenosis or occlusion, such as at the brachiocephalic level.
No acute intracranial process.
No evidence for metastatic disease.
MRI is more sensitive for small metastases.
Thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein, left brachiocephalic vein (along the catheter), but no evidence of SVC thrombosis.
Incomplete evaluation of atrophic right kidney, multiple renal cysts, and post-surgical changes involving the transverse colon.
Fluid filled structure adjacent to the pancreatic head may represent a small bowel loop, though this region is incompletely imaged (2:74); cannot exclude other etiologies for this fluid collection.
