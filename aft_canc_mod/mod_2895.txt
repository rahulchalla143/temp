Admission Date: [**2188-11-12**]        Discharge Date: [**2188-11-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2164-12-27**]        Sex:  F  Service:  CSU   BRIEF CLINICAL HISTORY:  Ms. [**Known lastname 59870**] is a 23 year old Haitian woman who presented originally to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2188-11-12**], with approximately two to three week history of mid sternal chest discomfort which had been treated with codeine.
Circumstances surrounding the patient's presentation were somewhat confusion and contradicted at various times by the patient and various family members.
Soon after arriving she began experiencing shortness of breath, dyspnea and intermittent fever and chills.
While she did endorse that the symptoms became worse during her flight, it was generally agreed that there was a prodrome that superceded her flight.
Upon her presentation to the Emergency Department on the afternoon of the 17th the patient was complaining of shortness of breath, dyspnea and increasing bilateral lower extremity swelling.
She had had a productive cough for at least the last 48 hours, being described as yellow to green sputum.
She did describe fevers and denied any night sweats.
Unclear history of a resection of the neck mass, apparently in the [**Country 13622**] Republic although this was never entirely clear.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a sister with [**Name2 (NI) 14165**] cell disease and is thought to have [**Name2 (NI) 14165**] cell trait.
She had a temperature maximum and temperature currently of 97.8 degrees.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination showed dry mucous membranes and unable to visualize posterior discs.
Neck is supple, there is, however, a small 1 cm scar seen on the left side, no evidence of any thyromegaly or anterior or posterior lymph node chain adenopathy.
Chest shows decreased breath sounds bilaterally but in particular on the left side.
There are coarse crackles throughout bilaterally.
Cardiac examination is tachycardiac, no evidence of any murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Radiology:  The patient had a patchy interstitial infiltrates, left side greater than right with left pleural effusions as well as some poorly differentiated pleural thickening throughout.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Based on the patient's initial presentation, it was thought that her presentation was a most likely acute and chronic etiology.
Scenarios considered were pneumonia, pulmonary embolism secondary to recent air travel, severe asthma.
Given the tachypnea and poor oxygenation, the patient was admitted directly to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit.
This removed greater than 250 mm of serosanguinous fluid from the left side.
Within two hours of presentation to the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient became tachypneic and arterial blood gases showed increasing difficulty with oxygenation.
Aspiration showed a large amount of purulent, sometimes bloody material within the lung parenchyma.
Thereafter the patient's presentation became increasingly consistent with aseptic etiology.
By morning, her respiratory status had worsened and again there became increasing problems with oxygenation.
However, the decision was made to delay extracorporeal membrane oxygenation over night and to reassess in the morning.
Bedside echocardiogram showed evidence of a large pericardial effusion.
It was not clear if this was secondary to the pneumonia, pulmonary embolism or other etiology.
During this maneuver, there was some damage noted to the right ventricle, most likely secondary to a large dilated ventricle in the setting of high right-sided pressures.
Initial intraoperative pathology showed pathology consistent with neuroendocrine carcinoma, again highly unusual for a woman of this age and this presentation.
Given the unclear etiology of these lesions and the patient's overall presentation, decision was made to continue aggressive treatment and while in the Operating Room the patient was catheterized per the right femoral vein and artery and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was started.
Initial staining of the tissue likewise was thought to be neuroendocrine tumor, however, subsequent specialized staining with amino peroxidase showed this tumor to, in fact, to be consistent with a poorly differentiated large cell carcinoma.
In further reviewing the patient's history, both by record and in discussion with her siblings and her mother in [**Country 2045**], it appears that the patient had a small lesion removed from her neck somewhere in the [**Country 13622**] Republic.
By hospital day 9 or postoperative day 6, final evaluation by Oncology had been completed and in discussion with the primary team, Oncology and the patient's family decision was made that attempt would be made to wean her from the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine, given that there was no clear interventions to be directed towards the cancer itself.
On [**11-21**], [**2187**], after intensive optimization of her ventilator settings, fluid status and introduction of nitric oxide, attempt was made to wean the patient from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
By the following day after an additional review by the Cardiac Surgery Service, opinion rendered by the Ethics Support Service, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 59871**] [**Name (STitle) 59872**], and position taken by the [**Hospital6 1760**] Legal Department, decision was made for a final wean of the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine.
Over the next two to three hours, the patient required increasing pressure support, maxing out Levophed, epinephrine, Natrecor, Neo-Synephrine and ventilator settings, none of which were to maintain a blood pressure compatible with life.
At approximately 7 PM the patient became asystolic and unresponsive to further chemical interventions.
There were several long discussions at that time with the patient's brother and sister as well as various members of the Creole community.
The patient's mother did appear willing and anxious to have an autopsy performed and this was arranged.
