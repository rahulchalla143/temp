Multiple attempts to contact the patient went unanswered and multiple messages were left (see OMR notes).
Her 1 mg Dex-suppression test suppressed to 3 which does not completely rule out Cushings.
A normal IGF-1 level was done to rule out Acromegaly.
Her prolactin level was mildly elevated at 24.
She was electively admitted on [**2-11**] to undergo said procedure  Past Medical History: Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Depression/Anxiety Roux-en-y gastric bypass in [**2170-8-18**].
Diabetic prior to gastric bypass Pituitary Macroadenoma  Social History:  Separated with two grown children.
No smoking or alcohol.
F: died of some type of heart disorder at age of 45, ?
No pituitary dysfunction or other endocrine problems in the family.
No paraphrasic errors.
There is no tremor.
She is tolerating all po food and fluids well and has not had any residual nausea or vomiting.
There is no bleeding or drainage from the prior lumbar drain site.
The patient has remained afebrile with minimal nasal drainage and congestion.
Pertinent Results: Labs On Admission: [**2174-2-12**] 04:08AM BLOOD WBC-10.8# RBC-4.53 Hgb-12.7 Hct-37.8 MCV-84 MCH-28.1 MCHC-33.7 RDW-14.7 Plt Ct-263 [**2174-2-12**] 04:08AM BLOOD PT-12.8 PTT-25.9 INR(PT)-1.1 [**2174-2-12**] 04:08AM BLOOD Calcium-9.1 Phos-3.0 Mg-1.9 [**2174-2-11**] 10:47PM BLOOD Osmolal-298  Labs on Discharge:  Imaging: Head CT [**2-11**]: FINDINGS: The sella is enlarged and measures 13.8 mm in AP diameter.
Again noted is a heterogeneous mixed attenuation mass arising from the sella and extending into the suprasellar region, best demonstrated on the MRI that was concurrently performed.
There is calcification of the bilateral cavernous carotid arteries.
The sphenoid sinuses and sphenoethmoid recesses are clear.
There is no definite evidence for erosion of the clivus.
The sphenoid sinus septum inserts approximately 8 mm laterally from the right bony carotid canal.
There is slight septal deviation to the left.
There is a focal area of hyperdensity of similar attenuation to the skull likely representing a calcified meningioma or exostosis.
There is no hypodensity in the underlying frontal lobe to suggest edema.
Pituitary mass with extension from the sella to the suprasellar region with no evidence of clival invasion.
Dehiscence of a portion of the left bony carotid canal.
MRI Head [**2-11**]: INDINGS: Images through the brain demonstrate no evidence of acute infarct.
No mass effect or hydrocephalus is seen.
No focal abnormalities.
Fluid and high intensity material are seen within the sphenoid sinus and the posterior nasal passage.
A small amount of soft tissue changes are seen in the sellar and suprasellar region with mild enhancement.
The majority of the soft tissue mass identified in the sellar and suprasellar region has been resected.
The subtle enhancing lesions could be residual mass or due to some postoperative enhancement.
No evidence of acute infarcts or mass effect.
Postoperative changes within the sphenoid sinus and posterior nasal passage and in the pituitary region with high intensity packing material.
No hemorrhage.
Although, high density material is seen within the pituitary fossa, No intracranial hemorrhage seen.
Majority of the mass has been removed with subtle enhancing soft tissues seen in the suprasellar region with decreased mass effect on the optic chiasm.
She remained neurologically intact (including visual acuity and visual fields).
She has been closely monitored for change in neurologic status, as well as for any evidence of Diabetes Insipidus or SIADH.
She has not displayed symptoms consistent with either.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
Prednisone should also be taken with a glass of milk or with a meal.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
It is normal for feel nasal fullness for a few days after surgery, but if you begin to experience drainage or salty taste at the back of your throat, that resembles a ??????dripping??????
