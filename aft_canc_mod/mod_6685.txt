Admission Date:  [**2136-4-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-5-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-4-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Cefepime  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**] Chief Complaint: new diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia, admission for 7+3 induction chemotherapy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 7+3 induction chemotherapy (idarubicin x3 days and cytarabine x3 days)  History of Present Illness: Please see NP note for more details.
In brief, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 yo M with a FH of MDS who presents for 7+3 induction chemotherapy following a new diagnosis of AML.
Patient was noted to have thrombocytopenia in [**7-10**], but did not follow up until [**3-12**].
Denies fevers, chills, weight loss, night sweats, easy bruising or bleeding, chest pain, shortness of breath, or lower extremity edema.
Past Medical History: Psoriasis on Enbrel for last couple of years Depression Panic Disorder Colonic Polyps/Adenoma .
Family History: He has a brother who died at the age of 67 from myelodysplastic syndrome.
Neck: L subclavian central line placed Pulm: CTAB no crackles or wheezes Abd: soft, NT, +BS.
Extremities: wwp, no edema.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
There is a loop of proximal jejunum which is abnormally thickened in the left upper quadrant.
There is also mild thickening involving the entire colon, consistent with mild colitis.
No evidence of perforation or abscess.
There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
Transfusion Reaction Investigation: DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Mr. [**Known lastname **] experienced a temperature increase of 2.4 degrees F over the course of receiving an entire unit of leukoreduced, irradiated, compatible red cells.
Laboratory workup revealed no evidence of hemolysis and the patient has had febrile episodes preceeding the transfusion that were not in the setting of transfusion.
Given that leukoreduction significantly reduces the incidence of febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions, the patient's fever is most likely due to his underlying illness and not the transfusion.
No change in transfusion practice is recommended at this time.
CT OF THE PELVIS: There is moderate thickening extending along the sigmoid colon and rectum.
No pelvic free fluid or lymphadenopathy.
Degenerative changes are seen in the lumbar spine, particularly at L5-S1.
IMPRESSION: Mild pancolitis and proximal jejunitis.
Screen predicts possible synergy with selected          penicillins or vancomycin.
This may represent typhlitis in the setting of neutropenia, or other infectious or inflammatory cause of colitis.
New scattered areas of centrilobular nodules and ground-glass opacities in the lungs, with the differential including atypical infection, drug toxicity, and inflammatory changes.
6-mm pulmonary nodule in the left upper lobe.
While this may represent a larger infectious or inflammatory nodule related to changes described above, a followup chest CT in three months is recommended to assess for stability.
Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Scattered areas of centrilobular nodules and ground-glass opacities within the bilateral lungs, most pronounced in the right upper lobe, which appears to slightly have progressed when compared to prior exam.
Differential diagnosis includes atypical infection, drug toxicity and inflammatory changes.
Marked improvement in pancolitis, with minimal persistent inflammatory changes in the cecum.
Pulmonary nodules in the lingula.
Followup chest CT in three months is recommended to assess for stability.
No thrombus in the deep venous system of the left upper extremity.
Occlusive thrombus in the left cephalic vein, not propagating centrally into the left axillary vein.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No endocarditis, abscess or significant valvular regurgitation seen.
Erythrocytes are decreased and show mild anisopoikilocytosis with rare echinocytes, dacrocytes, and microcytes.
Aspirate Smear: The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation, with several markedly hypocellular spicules, which consists primarily of histiocytes and stromal cells.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation, and consists of markedly hypocellular marrow (less than 5% cellular) consisting primarily of stromal cells with rare scattered plasma cells and scant hematopoietic precursors.
There is focal background eosinophilic material consistent with chemotherapy effect.
No thrombus in the deep venous system of the left upper extremity.
Occlusive thrombus in the left cephalic vein, unchanged compared to prior study.
The known right upper lobe rounded ground-glass opacities are below the resolution of the chest radiograph.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Overall, no evidence of new acute cardiopulmonary process.
His hospital course was complicated by fever and neutropenia due to pancolitis and subsequent VRE bacteremia.
His course was complicated by VRE bacteremia and sepsis, which persisted; he was found to have a cephalic vein clot, thought to be the source of continued bacteremia despite appropriate antibiotic coverage.
He was anticoagulated for his cephalic vein clot, discontinued after a 5-pt hematocrit drop and guaiac positive stool.
He had an episode of hematemesis on [**5-19**], at which time he was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.
DETAILED ICU COURSE: He was transferred to the ICU with likely upper GI bleed (hematemesis and melanotic stools) and continued to be febrile to 105F, improving with Tylenol.
After three transfusions, he developed acute respiratory distress.
Management of his severe heart failure was initiated with captopril and continued Lasix.
On [**5-23**], he became tachycardic with CVP ~11, on NIPPV.
Given agitation and discomfort, he was given a trial of high flow mask, and his oxygen levels remained 93-95%, MAPs > 65, with stable mentation.
At approximately 3am on [**5-24**], he became apneic and heart rate became bradycardic.
Tolerated chemotherapy well, but hospital course complicated by pancolitis and VRE bacteremia (see below).
The patient underwent a clinical trial which was randomized to Cytarabine with or without Clofarabine.
No leukemia was seen in the marrow and the patient was started on neupogen on [**5-17**] to help his counts recover in the setting of bacteremia.
# VRE Bacteremia and Sepsis: Patient had fever and neutropenia likely due to VRE bacteremia.
Was initially broadly covered with antibiotics (Vancomycin, Cefepime, Micafungin, and Flagyl and Acyclovir) until blood cultures grew VRE (E. faecium) from his venous line blood culture.
Line was pulled, culture tip showed no growth.
He again starting having fevers on [**2136-5-11**] and blood cultures showed VRE.
He had a new PICC line which was pulled on [**2136-5-12**] and the tip was cultured and again showed no growth.
His infectious workup included a repeat chest, abdomen and pelvis CT which showed resolution of his pancolitis but RUL nodules in the lung concerning for infection.
He had a TTE that showed no valvular vegetations or evidence of endocarditis.
However, a left upper extremity ultrasound demonstrated a superficial venous clot in the cephalic vein.
The patient continued to spike fevers and grow positive blood cultures despite the organism being sensitive to daptomycin.
However, he continued to spike fevers and have VRE positive blood cultures on this drug, despite sensitivity to it as well.
He continued to spike fevers and grow VRE from his blood cultures.
Despite his persistent bacteremia and daily fevers, at times to 104, the patient remained relatively hemodynamically stable, with good blood pressure but periods of tachycardia, until his transfer to the ICU [**5-19**].
# Superficial venous thrombus: This was diagnosed by ultrasound on [**5-13**].
The patient was briefly anticoagulated with a heparin gtt at low dose, however, he dropped his hematocrit from 25 to 20 and had hemeoccult positive stool, so this drug was stopped.
# Hemetemesis/melena: On [**5-19**] the patient had an episode of hemetemesis and melena.
# Diarrhea: The patient developed worsening diarrhea during the week of [**5-16**].
Stool was sent for microbiological analysis.
# Drug rash/petechiae: Maculopapular drug rash noted on Day 14, likely due to cefepime, which was discontinued and replaced with aztreonam.
No further progression of drug rash was noted.
# Pancolitis: Patient had diarrhea while neutropenic and fevers.
Treated with immodium as needed for comfort.
# Psoriasis: Held enbrel while on chemotherapy.
# EtOH use:  Patient has significant alcholol use.
Kept on valium CIWA scale, but no signs of withdrawal.
