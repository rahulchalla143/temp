He was subsequently found to have NSCLC with metastases to the adrenals.He was admitted to the MICU on [**2168-8-15**] and required angiography w/ embolization for a lung parenchyma bleed.
4 days prior to presentation, he noted having dependent ankle swelling associated productive cough, orthopnea and increased dyspnea.
Labs were notable for a leukocytosis with bandemia of 9%, lactate 3.7 --> 3.1, and sodium 131.
CXR and CT revealed a large right pleural effusion.
On the floor, he reports dyspnea associate with productive cough, and he denies any fevers and chills, any chest pain, nausea or palpitation.Denies any abdominal pain, diarrhea.
Engaged to [**Doctor First Name **], who previously had cancer and treatment.

no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: tachy, Regular rate and rhythm, systolic murmur no rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, 1+ edema in LE, no clubbing, cyanosis  DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM: Not applicable, patient expired.
Worsening perihilar opacities bilaterally, right greater than left, and new lobulated nodular opacities within the periphery of mid lung fields bilaterally.
Findings are concerning for progression of metastatic disease with possible lymphadenopathy.
Large right pleural effusion.
No sizeable left pleural effusion noted.
Increased interstitial markings within the right lung, which may reflect lymphangitic spread of tumor, and less likely volume overload.
No acute pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic pathology.
In this patient with known lung cancer, there has been significant interval progression of metastatic disease compared to the prior study.
Numerous pulmonary and pleural based nodules, mediastinal lymph nodes and adrenal masses, have increased in size.
Extensive bilateral hilar consolidations.
While a component may be secondary to radiation change, the new or increased consolidations in the right middle and lower lobes are concerning for metastatic disease or possibly infection.
Moderate-to-large right and a small left pleural effusions.
[**2-6**] CT Head: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, or infarction.
No soft tissue swelling noted.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
[**2-7**] ECHO: There is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion.
No evidence of DVT in veins of bilateral lower extremities.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Suboptimal image quality.
Very small pericardial effusion localized to the right atrial free wall.
Hyperdynamic left ventricular function.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior report (images not able to be reviewed) of [**2169-2-7**], the pericardial effusion is now only very small and loculated adjacent to the right atrium.
Pleural Fluid cytology showed rare atypical epithelioid cells with enlarged nuclei and prominent nucleoli, too few to characterize.
Pericardial Fluid cytology showed predominantly blood with lymphocytes, neutrophils, and few mesothelial cells.
Brief Hospital Course: 62yo male with metastatic NSCLC s/p XRT and chemotherapy, previous MICU admission [**7-/2168**] requiring embolization for lung parenchymal bleed, recurrent hemoptysis, who presented with increased ankle edema, productive cough, orthopnea, and dyspnea, as well as worsening LLE pain.
Work-up revealed large right pleural effusion, which was drained after pigtail catheter placement.
Course c/b by aspiration event, hypercarbic respiratory failure and acidemia requiring intubation, hypotension in setting of probable sepsis and cardiac tamponade, s/p pericardiocentesis.
# Shock: Multifactorial etiology, though continued shock was most likely secondary to septic shock.
Initial differential included cardiogenic vs. septic vs. adrenal inusficiency.
Bedside echo revealed evidence of pericardial effusion and possible cardiac tamponade, and after cardiology consulted patient taken to cath lab for pericardiocentesis.
180cc pericardial fluid drained on [**2169-2-7**] and  follow up echo on [**2169-7-11**] show very small pericardial effusion remaining.
A restrictive cardiogenic process was considered, given hyperdynamic heart and preload dependence.
However, based on overall clinical picture, central venous O2 sats, sepsis etiology felt to be most likely in setting of pneumonia.
Adrenal insufficiency was also likely contributing.
Patient treated with broad spectrum antibiotics and aggressive volume resuscitation.
After a few days o of treatment he did not improve and he started to develop a significantly elevated white count, refractory hypotension and increasing oxygen requirements.
Respiratory Distress:  Initial dyspnea and hypoxia were most likely secondary to right pleural effusion, and patient had significant improvement in dyspnea following drainage of about 2L exudative effusion via pigtail catheter placement.
Effusion likely malignant; pleural fluid analysis showed atypical cells on cytology and was negative for infection/empyema.
Given productive cough and leukocytosis, also had concern for PNA, which was thought to be post-obstructive in nature.
CTA was negative for PE and LENIs also negative.
Patient had significant aspiration event on night of [**2-7**], with subsequent development of acidemia and hypercarbia.
Patient continued on broad spectrum antibiotics, with regimen later broadened to include cipro for pseudomonas double coverage as patient was continuing to spike fevers and WBC was trending up.
Patient also became volume overloaded and developed pulmonary edema in setting of aggressive IVF administration for shock (see below).
He started to having increasing oxygen requirements as discussed above.
#Adrenal Insufficiency: Patient has known adrenal mets, and given eosinophilia on WBC differential, was concern for adrenal insufficiency.
Possible recurrence of lung parenchymal hemorrhage in setting of malignancy.
#Left hip pain: Patient with significant pain in LLE.
Differential for pain included possible bony metastases, as well as DVT.
Previous PET CT did not show any evidence of metastases.
Patient initially started on morphine PCA for pain control, was switched to fentanyl gtt/bolus as needed for pain.
Tachycardia: Likely multifactorial in setting of pain,sepsis and restrictive cardiac pathology.
Patient remained tachycardic despite massive fluid ressucitation.
Most likely due to hypovolemic hyponatremia.
Patient has had recent MRI of lumbar spine in [**12/2168**] which showed multiple levels of canal stenosis and bilateral severe neural foraminal narrowing.
This slowly trended down as he clinically worsened until on the evening of [**2-11**] his urine output ceased entirely in the setting of hypotension and worsening sepsis.
Given all of his underlying tumor burden and his worsening clinicial condition, his family decided to start comfort measures and he was terminally extubated.
