His wife woke up at 6 am the day of presentation and witnessed  him jerking in the bed.
He didn't bite his tongue nor did he have urinary incontinence.
He was drowsy and couldn't speak for about 30 mins after the onset.

Visual fields Full, Fundi normal III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements intact bilaterally no nystagmus V1-3: Sensation intact V1-V3 to touch and pain VII: Facial movement symmetric.
No extinction to DSS but mild agraphesthesia on the R only.
Concern for neoplasm on OSH CT, first onset Sz this    am.
Provisional Findings Impression: JK [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**2123-1-29**] 8:25 PM PFI: Solitary left frontal mass with possible small hemorrhagic component.
Given these characteristics, either a hemorrhagic neoplasm or potentially metastatic, melanin-based tumor needs to be considered.
It is likely intra-axial, although its most peripheral extent lies at the cortical surface of the left frontal lobe.
There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.
The mass shows slightly restricted diffusion.
Within the right parietal lobe white matter is a 3-mm area of fluid signal intensity which does not exhibit pathological enhancement.
Its etiology is uncertain, although it may represent a dilated perivascular space, as opposed to a chronic lacunar infarct.
More typically linear perivascular spaces are seen within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, largely in a periatrial distribution.
The mass appears to have very slight susceptibility.
There is moderate mucosal thickening within the right maxillary sinus, and to a minor degree in the right mastoid sinus, consistent with an ongoing inflammatory process.
CONCLUSION: Solitary left frontal mass with possible small hemorrhagic component.
Given these characteristics, either a hemorrhagic primary or metastatic neoplasm, or potentially a metastatic, melanin-based tumor needs to be considered.

CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is an enlarged lymph node seen in the left axilla measuring 1.6 x 2.3 x 3.3 cm.
There are several smaller lymph nodes seen adjacent to this, the largest measures 1 cm in short axis, but has a very rounded appearance concerning for malignant involvement.
In the left shoulder region, lateral to the subscapularis muscle (3:17), there is a large enhancing soft tissue nodule.
No right axillary lymphadenopathy seen.
There is also a large left subpectoral enhancing mass seen measuring 6.4 x 5.1 x 3.3cm.

No pericardial effusions.
CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: No focal liver lesions are seen.
No biliary duct dilatation seen.
At the splenic hilum and in the left subdiaphragmatic space, there are several small round soft tissue nodules seen.
These most likely represent splenules however these could represent small lymph nodes.
There is a 1.6-cm portacaval node seen (2:61).
There are multiple tiny paraaortic lymph nodes seen, none of which meet CT size criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Similarly, there are small mesenteric lymph nodes which do not meet CT size criteria for pathologic enlargement.
No mesenteric stranding seen.
No free fluid seen.
No free fluid seen.
No pelvic lymphadenopathy is seen.
BONY STRUCTURES: Mild degenerative changes noted in the lumber spine with a gentle scoliosis convex to the right.
Degenerative changes seen in the left hip.
Enlarged lymph nodes in the left axilla.
Left shoulder soft tissue mass measuring 4.5 cm.
Left subpectoral soft tissue mass measuring 6.4 cm.
The appearance raises suspicion most for a melanoma primary in the left upper extremity or shoulder area, though other tumors in this region are possible.
1.6-cm portacaval node.
Small paraaortic lymph nodes also noted.
Multiple small soft tissue nodules in the left subdiaphragmatic region are likely splenules.
DIAGNOSIS:  Left axillary lymph node, ultrasound-guided core biopsy:         Metastatic malignant melanoma.
The histomorphologic and immunophenotypic findings are consistent with metastatic malignant melanoma.

Within the surgical bed, there are blood products which are intrinsically T1 hyperintense limiting evaluation for residual enhancing mass.
The surrounding edema is slightly increased compared with the prior study with minimal surrounding mass effect.
TECHNIQUE: MRI of the brain was performed utilizing sagittal and axial T1, axial T2, axial gradient, axial FLAIR and diffusion with ADC map sequences without intravenous contrast.
There is minimal scalp swelling in the region of the left frontal craniotomy and minimal extra-axial fluid at the surgical site.
Within the surgical bed within the left frontal lobe, there are blood products and surrounding edema within the white matter with minimal surrounding mass effect.
Due to the hemorrhage within the surgical site, which is intrinsically T1 hyperintense, evaluation of residual enhancing mass in this region is limited.
There is a stable focus of T2 hyperintensity within the right periventricular white matter possibly representing a prominant perivascular space.
Within the surgical bed, there are blood products which are intrinsically T1 hyperintense limiting evaluation for residual enhancing mass.
The surrounding edema is slightly increased compared with the prior study with minimal surrounding mass effect.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 3646**] is a 58yo RHM with no significant PMH here after a secondary generalized seizure.
He was in his usual state of health when his R arm suddenly extended followed by LOC and he was witnessed to have generalized convulsion lasting a few minutes.
He was initially taken to an OSH where head CT showed L frontal lesion with significant surrounding edema hence he was transferred here for further care after being loaded with Dilantin.
He was initially admitted to neurology service where MRI of head with and without contrast showed an enhancing 1.2cm solitary lesion in the L frontal lobe most concerning for melanoma.
CT torso also showed large L axillary lymph node which was biopsied per interventional radiology on [**2-1**].
Although concerning for metastatic melanoma, given the isolated lesion and surround edema, neuro-oncology consult (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**]) recommended resection.
Of note, given the concern for malignancy, Dilantin was switched to Keppra 1g [**Hospital1 **] and he did not have any further events concerning for seizure.
On [**2-3**], patient was taken to the OR for L frontal craniotomy for resection of mass.
On post op check, a slight R drift and expressive aphasia was noted, he was full strength otherwise.
Patient continued to have seizures and ativan was given.
On [**2-5**], on examination patient had RUE weakness 4/5, but was full strenght otherwise, he was alert and oriented to self and place and expressive aphasia persists.
