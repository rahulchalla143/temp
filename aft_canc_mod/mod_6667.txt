Prior to his presentation, he reportedly had not had any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, or altered mental status.
He did not have fever or leukocytosis.
Mental status was waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**], which was attributed to narcotic therapy used for severe abdominal pain.
An abdominal CT showed a 3 cm RUQ fluid collection at the distal tip of the VP shunt.
Occupation: former auto parts salesman  Drugs: denies  Tobacco: smoked 1 ppd x 20 yrs; quit one year ago  Alcohol: formerly drank approx 6 beers/night; drank [**2-13**] beers/night up until cancer diagnosis in [**2179**]   Family History: Mother died of pancreatic cancer; two uncles died of lung cancer; one brother died of esophageal cancer; another brother died of head/neck cancer   Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM V/S T 97.3 HR 99 RR 23 O2sat 97%  General: lying in bed with eyes closed and intermittently moaning  HEENT: no scleral icterus, dry mucous membranes  Neck: supple, no cervical/supraclavicular lymphadenopathy  Chest: scattered rhonchi and loud upper airway sounds  CV: regular rate/rhythm, normal s1s2, no murmurs  Abdomen: soft, mildly distended, no guarding but significantly tender to palpation especially on right side; (+) rebound tenderness; normal bowel sounds; (+) upper right flank drain with whitish liquid drainage  Extremities: warm, no edema, 2+ PT pulses  Skin:  no jaundice or rashes  Neurologic:  alert, disoriented and inattentive, intermittently following commands; CN 2-12 intact, though exam limited by poor attentiveness/cooperation; 4/5 strength in bilateral deltoids, biceps, triceps, wrist extensors, hip flexors/extensors, ankle flexors/extensors; 2+ biceps reflexes bilaterally; unable to elicit patellar reflexes   Pertinent Results: 7/28/098 MRI HEAD W/ CONRAST There are changes from a right frontal and left parietal craniotomy.
There is slight decrease in the soft tissue swelling overlying the left parietal craniotomy.
There is a right frontal ventricular catheter with its tip just past the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
There is a postoperative cavity in the left parietal lobe with blood products within it, which appears to be relatively stable in terms of size and mild associated enhancement.
Enhancing lesion in the right cerebellum appears to be stable.
No new enhancing foci are seen.
Previously noted subdural fluid collections and dural enhancement have decreased to a large degree.
There has been progression of confluent periventricular hyperintensity, which may reflect post-treatment sequela.
The ventricles are mildly enlarged compared to the prior study.
The post-gadolinium enhancing volume of the right cerebellar lesion measures 1.16 cm3.
IMPRESSION: Postoperative changes, no new enhancing foci are seen.
[**2181-8-4**] CXR There are low lung volumes.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
There is atelectasis in the right base.
Ill-defined opacity in the right apex is consistent with patient's known lung cancer.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
New lung nodules as described above.
Atelectasis of the right lower lobe, associated with effusion; no pleural nodule.
Bronchomalacia of the right main bronchus and intermedius bronchus, evoked by expiration.
No evidence of intracranial abscess or VP shunt infection.
However, CT has significantly limited sensitivity in this regard, compared to MRI.
Known enhancement in the left cerebellum and at the left parietal surgical site, seen on the [**2181-7-9**] MRI, is not appreciated due to differences in technique.
Increased hemispheric white matter hypodensity without mass effect, likely related to radiation therapy.
[**2181-8-8**] NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT The patient is status post right VP shunt removal with a small locule of air noted non-dependently within the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] in addition to a trace amount of likely post-surgical intraventricular hemorrhage noted dependently within the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Small extra-axial fluid collections are unchanged.
Subcutaneous emphysema and a mild amount of edema is noted along the external old VP shunt site.
Mild mucosal thickening within the ethmoid air cells and sphenoid sinus is stable as is partial opacification of the mastoid air cells bilaterally.
Trace amount of blood within the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**], otherwise no significant interval change status post VP shunt removal.
There is an oblique fracture of the proximal shaft of the humerus.
There is callus formation at the fracture site, although the fracture line is partially visible.
There is no evidence of dislocation.
Mild degenerative arthritic change is present in the shoulder joint.
IMPRESSION: Healing fracture proximal humerus.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to       hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..     FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):     FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):   Brief Hospital Course: #Hypercapnic respiratory failure - Secondary to COPD exacerbation in the setting of narcotic analgesia and aspiration pneumonitis.
#VP shunt infection - Given changes in mental status with an indwelling catheter, the patient was continued on broad-spectrum ABX and the VP shunt was removed [**2181-8-7**].
Mental status progressively improved and the patient did not have any signs or symptoms of residual neurological deficit.
#RUQ fluid collection - Ultrasound-guided drainage of this collection at the OSH reportedly revealed purulent material, most likely an infected pseudocyst which formed at the distal site of the VP catheter.
Peritoneal fluid was not consistent with peritonitis and culture grew lactobacillus.
His abdominal symptoms and exam progressively improved prior to discharge.
#Metastatic NSCLC - Most recent MRI [**2181-7-9**] showed stable metastatic disease in the cerebellum.
The patient has scheduled follow-up with his oncologist 2 weeks after discharge, at which time he is due for a repeat MRI.
#HTN - The patient did not carry the diagnosis of hypertension prior to admission but had BP 160-180/80-100 in the setting of corticosteroid therapy.
Blood pressure should be closely monitored during steroid taper, and amlodipine may be decreased or discontinued accordingly.
#Prophylaxis - Given pneumoboots for DVT PPX, and PPI and ISS while on steroids.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) INH Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] Northeast - [**Location (un) 1110**]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) Hypercapnic respiratory failure 2) Ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection s/p shunt removal 3) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 4) Non-small-cell lung cancer   Discharge Condition: asymptomatic with stable vital signs.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with an infection of your ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
You also had a COPD flare treated with mechanical ventilation, nebulizer breathing treatments and a course of steroids which is scheduled to be completed on Wednesday [**8-22**].
Please call your physician or return to the Emergency Department if you experience fever, chills, sweats, dizziness, lightheadedness, headache, confusion, aversion to light, changes in vision, chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, back pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, bloody or dark stools, leg pain or swelling, numbness, weakness, tingling, or falls.
