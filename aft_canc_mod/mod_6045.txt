Patient was in discomfort, but apparently could not localize where pain was originating.
Workup included CT abdomen/pelvis which revealed a 7 mm obstructing stone in the right ureter, with a UA significant only for many bacteria.
IR was consulted and decided patient was not a candidate for perc tubes because of her body habitus.
CXR revealed a RML opacity and she was given combivent nebs and solumedrol 125 mg IV x1.
Patient subsequently developed hypoxic respiratory failure while in CT, with desaturation to the 70s.

Right pupil dilated and non-reactive.
Palate elevated symmetrically.
Finger-to-nose grossly impaired bilaterally, with marked ataxia on right.
Pertinent Results: [**6-19**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2205-2-26**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
No acute intracranial process.
No CT evidence of recurrence of tumor.
Mild hazy opacity is noted over the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with atelectasis.
There is an indwelling left subclavian Port-A-Cath, with the catheter tip projecting over the area of the superior cavoatrial junction.
There is mild aortic tortuosity.
No definite effusion or pneumothorax is noted.
Degenerative changes are noted throughout the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: No definite acute pulmonary process.
7-mm obstructive renal stone within the right proximal ureter with associated moderate hydronephrosis, periureteric and perinephritic stranding.
Perinephric fluid is concerning for forniceal rupture.
[**6-20**] ECHO: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate LVH with hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
Mild mitral and moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 73 year old female with PMH of CNS lymphoma, history of CVA, atrial fibrillation/flutter, diastolic CHF, and OSA who presented with nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, and abdominal pain and found to have obstructive nephrolithiasis and Klebsiella bacteremia/sepsis.
The patient was found to have an obstructing 7mm right ureteral stone and a right middle lobe lung opacity.
In the ED, the patient rapidly developed respiratory failure requiring intubation and MICU admission.
Vancomycin and meropenem were briefly added back due to hypothermia and hypotension, but they were again stopped on [**2205-6-24**].
Hypoxic respiratory failure:  On the ventillator, the patient had difficulty with oxygenation which required paralysis and increased PEEP.
There were also difficulties with weaning.
Precedex was tried, but the patient had a long sinus pause with associated hypotension.
# Left Eye pain.
Chronic in nature and of unclear etiology.
# Afib/flut: On admission she had poor rate control likely in the setting of sepsis, which has since improved after appropriate anitbiotics treatment.
She is not on rate controlling agents at baseline and not anticoagulated due to prior hemorrhagic CVAs despite her CHADS score of 4.
# Chronic diastolic CHF: Her last ECHO was [**2205-6-20**] and showed an EF>75%.
Trazodone was also added as needed for sleep.
Hypercalcemia: The patient's MICU course was complicated by hypercalcemia with a peak of 11.1, which was attributed to hyperparathyroidism.
