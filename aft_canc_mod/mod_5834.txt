However, we were unable to obtain brushings or biopsies to confirm this through multiple interventional approaches in the bile duct.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a 30 pound weight loss as well as anorexia and intermittent abdominal pain.
I reviewed his images which showed a distended gallbladder with very large stone within it which was compressing directly on the duodenum as well as the bile duct.
There was a suggestion of a Mirizzi's syndrome type of problem from the ERCP as well as the CT scan.
However, his CA19-9 level was up at 68 and his ERCP images were more suggestive of malignancy.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] also suffered an episode of stent cholangitis within the last month and because of this, we collectively decided to take him to the operating room to get a definitive diagnosis as well as to hopefully treat the biliary tract obstruction.
