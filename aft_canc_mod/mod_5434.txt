In the ED, CTA was performed which revealed PE in the right middle, right lower pulmonary artery and several right and left segmental pulmonary arterial branches.
She had no hemodynamic compromise.
Past Medical History: HTN x 1 month hypercholesterolemia osteoporosis GERD Recently diagnosed [**1-11**] high grade glioma c/w glioblastoma multiforme WHO grade [**2-6**] MRI Brain [**1-13**]: Enhancing masses in the right parietal lobe, thalamus, and posterior internal capsule, and hippocampus.
The avidly enhancing appearance and distribution of these findings are most suggestive of a high-grade glioma such as glioblastoma multiforme.
Much less likely are entities such as lymphoma or PNET.
Her husband died of pancreatic cancer 15 months ago, 5 weeks after his diagnosis.
Family History: CAD Sister - ovarian cancer Brother - brain tumor, ?metastatic melanoma, d. age 46.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: grade 4 gbm s/p f p brain biopsy on 2 8 06. now with chest pain at high risk for PE MULTIDETECTOR CT SCAN OF THE THORAX (CT ANGIOGRAM PROTOCOL).
CLINICAL DETAILS: Right brain mass (glioblastoma multiforme).
Acute nonocclusive thrombus within the right middle lobe pulmonary artery extending over several centimeters in length and also in the proximal portion of the right lower lobe pulmonary artery and at least one segmental branch of the right lower lobe pulmonary artery at the medial lung base (series 4, image 80).
There are also smaller areas of focal mural-based thrombus in at least two and possibly three segmental branches of the left lower lobe pulmonary artery (series 4, image 70 and image 63).
Appearances are consistent with acute pulmonary embolus.
Moderate atelectasis of the posteromedial aspect of the right lower lobe with small right basal pleural effusion.
Minor linear atelectatic band in the posterior aspect of the left lower lobe with minimal rim of left basilar pleural fluid.
No lung lesions or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
No bone lesions demonstrated on bone window settings.
Acute pulmonary embolus involving right middle, right lower pulmonary artery and several right and left segmental pulmonary arterial branches as described.
Moderate atelectasis of both posterior lung bases with small associated pleural effusions.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2196-1-28**] 2:51 PM  BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  Reason: assess for residual DVT for planning on anticoagulation dura  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 71 year old woman with GBM, b/l PE REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: assess for residual DVT for planning on anticoagulation duration  INDICATION: 71-year-old female with GBM and bilateral pulmonary embolus.
No intraluminal thrombus is identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the bilateral lower extremities.
Since the examination of [**1-12**], there is new opacity at the right lung base, likely representing atelectasis and pleural effusion.
The pulmonary vascularity appears within normal limits, without evidence of vascular congestion.
IMPRESSION: Right pleural effusion and right lower lobe atelectasis versus consolidation.
These findings are new since the [**1-12**] chest radiograph and may be slightly progressed from the chest CT of [**1-27**].
#PE:  Pt has PE of right middle, right lower pulmonary artery and several right and left segmental pulmonary arterial branches.
She had negative lower extremity ultrasounds with no DVTs, neuroncology was consulted and recommended she be started on life long anticoagulation with lovenox treatment doses for a pulmonary embolus.
Her pain was controlled with percocet, and she had an oxygen requirement of 2LNC at time of discharge.
#PPX: heparin gtt, colace, protonix  #FULL CODE: discussed with pt and son  She was to follow up with radiation oncology for treatment by calling [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9710**]   Medications on Admission: HTN x 1 month hypercholesterolemia osteoporosis GERD Recently diagnosed [**1-11**] high grade glioma c/w glioblastoma multiforme WHO grade [**2-6**] MRI Brain [**1-13**]: Enhancing masses in the right parietal lobe, thalamus, and posterior internal capsule, and hippocampus.
