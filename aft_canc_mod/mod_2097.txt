The patient has had surgery in the past for a question of some type of hepatic adenoma.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for a mother who had colon cancer at the age of 49.
An obvious 20 centimeters hypervascular mass occupying the lateral segment of the left hepatic lobe is present on the CT scan.
This mass appeared to be compressing the portal vein, inferior vena cava and hepatic artery, although there was no definite evidence of vascular invasion.
There was also a large right pleural effusion seen on the scan.
This MRI showed that this mass had significant mass effect upon the inferior vena cava.
The inferior vena cava is displaced right to left across the midline from the mass, which again does not show invasive features.
He required intubation for several days.
Each of those wounds was swabbed and sent for Gram stain and culture.
One of the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains at one point in time grew out Staphylococcus coagulase negative; this was the only significant finding and was only seen in one sample on one occasion.
This inferior vena cava clot was probably contributing to the tremendous amount of fluids he had in his lower extremities and he was being diuresed every day with Lasix.
