Admission Date:  [**2100-9-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2100-9-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2017-4-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Benazepril / Etodolac / Indomethacin / Naproxen / Sertraline / Oxycodone  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: back pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: T10 TRANSPEDICULAR CORPECTOMY WITH INTERBODY INSTRUMENTED FUSION T9 TO T11, DEEP BONE BIOPSY, AND POSTERIOR INSTRUMENTED FUSION T8 TO T12 WITH ALLOGRAFT AND AUTOGRAFT  History of Present Illness: She had 2 months of progressive back pain radiating to her bilateral flanks.
She was undergoing work up and treatment with spinal injections but the pain progressed and she developed bilateral LE weakness so she presented to an OSH ED ([**Location (un) 8641**] in NH).
CT at the OSH reportedly showed a T10 compression lesion without evidence of cord compression.
CT C and T spine along with CT torso showed several masses (lungs, liver, soft tissue and bone) concerning for metastatic disease; specificially raising suspicion for melanoma.
The patient went to the OR on [**9-4**] in an attempt to obtain tissue for diagnosis and decompress the T10 mass for pain relief.
There were no clear complications of the surgery but, post-operatively it was felt that she warrented ICU admission for monitoring.
Her PACU course was notable for 2 hours of low urine output.
The patient does report pain in her back and subjective feeling of SOB.
She denies numbness or tingling.
Past Medical History: Type II Diabetes Mellitus (Non-Insulin Dependent) COPD on continuous 2 L home O2 (sometimes does not use if not exerting herself) Possible History of Myocardial Infarction Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Arthritis Anxiety with claustrophobia/panic attacks ?Coronary Artery Disease (Q-waves present on EKG, negative stress test per patient in [**1-/2100**]) Appendectomy s/p lysis of adhesions Cholecystectomy s/p hysterectomy  Social History: She lives in [**Location (un) 3844**] in subsidized housing.
Family History: unable to obtain  Physical Exam: General Appearance: Overweight / Obese Eyes / Conjunctiva: PERRL Cardiovascular: normal S1/S2, no murmurs Peripheral Vascular: 2+ peripheral pulses Respiratory / Chest: bibasilar crackles Abdominal: Soft, Non-tender, Bowel sounds present, Obese Extremities: No edema Skin:  Warm Neurologic: [**6-9**] muscle strength in LLE, [**4-9**] muscle strength in hip flexors of RLE.
Large 4.6 cm left lower lobe mass concerning for a neoplastic process.
Additional soft tissue lytic lesion in the posterior right iliac bone.
Multiple soft tissue masses, one along the left and right lateral abdominal wall, and a second in the left labia and possible third in the left upper chest wall.
Lesions are concerning for neoplastic process.
Hypodense lesion in segment IVb of the liver which is incompletely evaluated but may also represent a metastatic or neoplastic process.
Conglomerate of findings raises concern for melanoma as a primary source.
[**2100-9-3**] CT T Spine: IMPRESSION: Large lytic mass infiltrating the T10 vertebral body and pedicle on the right with resultant severe central canal stenosis.
The effect of this stenosis on the cord are better evaluated on the comparison MR study.
[**2100-9-4**] CXR: Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
Left lower lobe retrocardiac mass is better visualized in prior CT.
There is no evident pneumothorax or pleural effusions.
Increased opacity in the left lower lobe is consistent with new atelectasis.
There is no overt CHF.
Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF MICU COURSE: Ms. [**Known lastname 16968**] was admitted to the MICU for low urine output and post-op monitoring.
She was noted to have new acute renal failure, likely due to dehydration and contrast recieved during the CT scan.
She was given LR boluses x 2 liters for low urine output.
She recieved morphine for pain control.
Her hematocrit was trending down from 37 to 28, likely from blood loss after surgery and dilutional from fluids.
She was noted to be CO2 retaining after surgery, likely from chronic COPD and sedation with hypoventilating.
