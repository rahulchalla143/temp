In addition, he was given a 5 week course of prophylactic PO vancomycin given a history of severe C diff colitis in the past.
He had been doing well at home, getting about with a walker or wheelchair and improving his PO intake.
About two or three days ago, he began to have increased work of breathing.
He was having some fevers at home as well but no shaking chills.
In addition, he had a cough that was productive, at one point of foul-smelling green sputum.
There were times he had some blood-streaked sputum as well.
CTA chest was negative for PE but showed airspace consolidation suggestive of RLL pneumonia.
In addition, IP was contact[**Name (NI) **] for possible flexible bronchoscopy in the morning to help relieve any obstruction.
His ED course was also notable for an episode when his wife stated he did not respond to verbal or tactile stimuli x 1 minute.
When the MD arrived to assess the patient, he was awake and responsive but somewhat consfused.
On review of systems, his wife notes that he has had episodes recently of being unresponsive after getting his fentanyl patch similar to what happened in the ED.
He also has been having some loose stool lately.
Past Medical History: Melanoma metastatic to lung, liver, heart, skin, and bone (spine) s/p high-dose IL-2 x 4 cycles, CTLA-4 antibody in [**5-6**] x 2, then EBRT to T7-T12 spine [**3-9**], currently receiving palliative XRT to hip mets (next dose due [**7-15**]) Hypercholesterolemia Hypothyroidism Sinus tachycardia at baseline Diabetes mellitus [**3-3**] study drug, developed in [**2-7**], diet-controlled h/o C diff colitis h/o severe neuropathy from CR-01 immunotoxin, now improving s/p Right knee surgery s/p Tonsillectomy Recent b/l upper lobe pneumonia treated in CT [**2138-5-30**] .
Oncologic History: Pt developed a broken rib in [**2133**],was treated conservatively at the time, intermittently treated with anti-inflammatory agents.
A surgeon performed a FNA biopsy of the parasternal mass which showed metastatic melanoma.
Biopsy of a parasternal mass at the site of a pathologic sternal fracture which revealed metastatic melanoma in 05/[**2135**].
The patient had no prior history of melanoma and no suspicious skin lesions.
Partial sternectomy with resection of the parasternal mass in 07/[**2135**].
Treatment was complicated by several autoimmune side effects including colitis, fever, arthralgias, and elevated transaminases.
CyberKnife treatment to an isolated right medial pulmonary mass which was at the time the only growing tumor.
This treatment was complicated by autoimmune colitis and later, the development of a superimposed C. difficile colitis that failed to respond to Flagyl and required oral vancomycin.
Cryoablation of a large LLL mass by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4702**] of the Interventional Pulmonary Department in [**Location (un) **], [**State 2748**].
The procedure was complicated by the development of a pneumothorax that required the placement of a Pleurx catheter, which has long since been removed.
This treatment gave rise to a severe peripheral neuropathy that is slowly improving.
Off-study Sutent therapy.
Family History: Father with melanoma in his 30s.
Physical Exam: 97.2    110    117/76    38    99% 2L Very thin, pale man in moderate respiratory distress.
No scleral icterus.
Neck supple, no JVD, no thyroid enlargement, no palpable cervical adenopathy.
Lungs with diffuse coarse crackles throughout, expiratory wheeze R>L.
+BS, soft, not tender or distended.
No LE edema.
RADIOLOGY: CT Head: IMPRESSION: Interval development of a 12 x 7 mm hyper-attenuating focus located in the right occipital lobe given history of metastatic melanoma is highly concerning for a focus metastasis.
Overall, progression of disease in the diffuse metastatic disease involving hilar, mediastinal, and axillary lymphadenopathy, pulmonary metastasis, cardiac, osseous, and hepatic metastases.
New multifocal parenchymal airspace consolidation involving the posterior aspect of the right lower lobe, the right middle lobe, that likely represents in multifocal superimposed infection.
Post-obstructive changes involving the left upper lobe with associated collapse.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Brief Hospital Course: Shortness of breath and fevers: Pneumonia.
He was noted to have hemoptysis and was intubated for resp distress as well as for need for bronchoscpoy.
He had tumor bleeding in the RLL and underwent rigid bronchoscopy x 3 for argon treatments and photocoagulation, these were temporarily successful.
This was technically sucessful but hemoptysis continued, patient was extubated w/ a plan for no further reintubation and comfort measures.
Patient died on [**7-25**] at 19:27 secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage causing respiratory arrest which is all related to his underlying metastatic melanoma.
