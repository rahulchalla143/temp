Pt last seen in clinic [**4-28**] and started on PO Fluconazole for duodenitis which has since been stopped due to GI upset.
Mr. [**Known lastname 79558**] reports approximately 8 months of progressively worsening PO intolerance, early satiety, transient abdominal distension relieved with belching, and weight loss.
Pt describes intermittent abdominal distension with rapid onset associated with 5/10 [**Known lastname 5283**] gassy pain.
Pain is exacerbated by PO intake and rapidly alleviated with large volume belching.
Minimal relief with flatus.
[**2-7**] isolated episodes non-bilious, non-bloody emesis over this period.
He has lost a total of 55 pounds since the onset of his symptoms with a [**7-13**] pound weight loss in the last week alone.

No new pulmonary abnormalities are present.
No pneumothorax is seen.
CTPA [**2145-5-11**] There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism, although evaluation of the subsegmental arteries is limited.
There is mild prominence of the right pulmonary artery when compared to the left.
There are bilateral small pleural effusions, left greater than right, with adjacent dependent atelectasis.
There is a small calcified granuloma at the left lung apex, unchanged.
Mucous secretions are noted in the distal left main bronchus and proximal aspect of lower lobe bronchi.
There is an enlarged right hilar lymph node (4:38), which measures 17 mm in short axis diameter, increased since [**12-9**], [**2144**] when it measured 8 mm in short axis diameter.
Small mediastinal lymph nodes are stable in size and do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Small left calcified hilar lymph nodes are again demonstrated, likely from prior granulomatous disease.
This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
Moderate amount of ascites and small foci of free intra-abdominal air are consistent with recent surgery.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable and there is improved aeration of the left lung bases with minimal left and right basal atelectasis still present.
The patient is after surgery with multiple abdominal drains partially imaged on the current study.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the Hepatobiliary Surgical Service for evaluation and treatment for Gastric Outlet Obstruction secondary to Duodenal stricture in setting of Cholangiocarcinoma s/p CBD excision, Roux-en-Y Hepaticojejunostomy and adjuvant Chemoradiation therapy.
On [**2145-5-10**], the patient underwent open retrocolic gastrojejunostomy which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter, and intermittent IV Dilaudid for pain control.
Neuro: The patient received intermittent IV Dilaudid and PO methadone with good effect and adequate pain control.
On [**2145-5-11**], patient experienced an acute desaturation to 88 on 1Lnc rebounding to 93 on NRB.
Given history of DVT/PE despite IVC filter in place and clinical exam at the time demonstrating diminished but present breath sounds bilaterally, pt was empirically started on a heparin drip for concern of PE.
Stat CXR was obtained with showed low lung volumes and concern for LLL collapse.
Pt was transferred to SICU and subsequently underwent CTPA which did  not demonstrate pulmonary embolus but did not obstruction of LLL bronchus.
Pt was transferred out of the ICU [**2145-5-13**] after which point, patient remained stable and improving from a pulmonary standpoint.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Pt experienced single self-limited episode of shaking chills and temperature to 100.7 on [**2145-5-15**].
Staple line and PTC insertion sites were routinely monitored for signs of infection of which there were none.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
