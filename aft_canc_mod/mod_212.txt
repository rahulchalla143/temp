IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 45-year-old HIV positive gentleman with a history of Hodgkin's disease in remission, now with a new diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by cervical node and renal biopsies, who presented with acute renal failure, likely due to autotumor lysis syndrome, requiring a medical intensive care unit admission and hemodialysis.
The patient also had hemoptysis, which appeared to be resolving once he reached the floor.
While he was receiving this, he experienced transient chest tightness associated with a cough, which resolved spontaneously after one to two minutes.
He had a bump in his white blood cell count after his first day on the floor because he received an extra dose of methylprednisolone by mistake.
His prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and INR normalized, making consumptive coagulopathy less likely.
with meals for an increase in his phosphorus and he was given repletion for a low calcium.
On [**2150-7-8**], a urinalysis showed large blood in the urine but no red blood cells, so it was decided to check a CK to look for myoglobinuria.
His CK was found to be elevated at 4820.
A bone marrow biopsy and aspiration were done on [**2150-7-10**], revealing negative cultures but findings consistent with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma infiltrating the bone marrow.
His liver function tests were elevated on [**2150-7-11**] with an ALT of 125, AST of 308 and alkaline phosphatase of 124, suggesting possible liver etiology to his increased CK.
On [**2150-7-14**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] returned from vacation and saw the patient, having not seen him since the medical intensive care unit.
He may substitute the doxorubicin with DaunoXome because it is less cardiotoxic and the patient has already received ABVD for Hodgkin's disease in the past.
Because of bone marrow involvement, the patient will need intrathecal therapy with ara-C times four treatments.
His Nephrocaps were discontinued and changed to a multivitamin with trace minerals because the patient was no longer on hemodialysis.
His elevated CK was thought not to be due to rhabdomyolysis since it was normal on admission and it would need a much higher level if it was rhabdomyolysis.
Myoglobulinuria was negative, again confirming the unlikelihood of rhabdomyolysis.
A chest x-ray on [**2150-7-12**] revealed a subscapular left kidney hematoma on CT scan, probably secondary to his renal biopsy and this would explain the drop of hematocrit to 19 on the day that he was transferred to the floor.
It has not seemed to cause the patient any problems such as muscle spasms or pain.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was afebrile on transfer to the floor.
for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis was started.
Their initial impression was that he clinically looked well and that the herpes simplex virus I was most likely a contaminant.
This was held off for the first few days because of his nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy, but once this resolved he was restarted.
On [**2150-7-10**], the patient spiked a fever in the evening and he was started on ceftazidime intravenously.
The source of this temperature was unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) **] also had recurrence of his hemoptysis and it was decided, with the infectious disease team's input and approval, to start the patient on intravenous acyclovir.
His stools were negative for Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Isospora and Microsporidium as well as being negative for Clostridium difficile twice.
His repeat sputum culture was negative for fungus, but viral cultures were showing herpes simplex virus-like effects again.
The patient had been neutropenic in the last few days and this was likely secondary to the chemotherapy, plus or minus the effect of the acyclovir.
Occasionally, he experienced some wheezing and he was started on albuterol metered dose inhaler and albuterol and Atrovent nebulizer p.r.n.
He was continued on Levaquin for a total of ten days to treat his pneumonia.
On the evening of [**2150-7-9**], the patient had increased congestion, cough and wheezing at night with a slight decrease in his oxygen saturation.
A chest x-ray showed increased vascularity, so intravenous fluids were decreased a little bit to 100 cc/hour instead of 150 cc/hour.
On [**2150-7-11**], the patient had recurrent bright red hemoptysis and a pulmonary consultation was requested with a repeat chest CT scan ordered to see if there was any source for this recurrent hemoptysis.
He was no longer coagulopathic at this point.
The pulmonary service thought that his hemoptysis was most likely due to an infectious etiology, possibly herpes simplex virus versus pneumonia.
Other possibilities included post extubation versus anti-GBM versus vasculitis.
His chest CT scan showed some pulmonary nodules, possibly consistent with lymphoma, and some right upper lobe ground-glass opacities, possibly consistent with infection.
He did have recurrent hiccups throughout his hospitalization stay with Thorazine being given every day and raised to 50 mg t.i.d.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient had diarrhea at the beginning of his floor stay.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The pt was originally scheduled to be discharged to [**Hospital1 **], but there were apparent insurance complications and pt was not approved for rehab stay.
History of Hodgkin's disease.
