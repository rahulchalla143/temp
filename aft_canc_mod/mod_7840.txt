IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**8-15**] through 10: Lung volumes are smaller today than yesterday, accounting for increase in the radiodensity of predominantly dependent pulmonary edema but shifted to the left.
No pneumothorax.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
There is moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
