Pt was lethargic at home, poor oral intake with associated diarrhea past 2 days.
Of note, patient was recently admitted to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1495**] [**Doctor First Name **] twice this past month for CHF exacerbation and UTI where she was started on an antibiotic (unclear from family) and subsequently readmitted with diarrhea and abdominal pain.
CT scan performed concerning for pan-colitis.
Diffuse infectious/inflammatory colitis, incompletely evaluated due to collapsed bowel and lack of oral contrast.
Pseudomembranous colitis is also a consideration, correlate with recent medication use.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
The presence of a minimal left-sided pleural effusion cannot be excluded given the blunting of the left costophrenic sinus.
Known configuration of the cardiac silhouette, no newly appeared focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
[**2151-3-5**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferior wall and abnormal septal motion.
There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 40%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta and aortic arch are mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
An eccentric, jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen directed along the interatrial septum.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Regional and global left ventricular systolic suggestive of multivessel CAD or other diffuse process.
Moderate mitral regurgitation suggestive of papillary muscle dysfunction.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on [**2151-3-2**] for evaluation and treatment of hypotension and severe diarrhea, with concern of clostridium difficile colitis given recent multiple antibiotic exposure.
Admission abdominal/pelvic CT revealed findings consistent with diffuse infectious versus inflammatory colitis.
Neuro: Initially, the patient received Morphine IV PRN for pain with good effect and adequate pain control.
When tolerating oral intake, the patient was transitioned to oral acetaminophen for discomfort with continued good effect.
She received Haldol early in admission for agitation, which was discontiuned early, and changed to Ativan PRN for anxiety.
CV: Upon admission, hypotension responded well to vigorous IV rescusitation.
She was placed on Metoprolol IV for rate control and ultimately BP management, which was converted back to home Metoprolol XL 150mg plus Lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **].
[**2151-3-5**] [**Year (4 digits) 461**] to evaluate CHF revealed regional and global left ventricular systolic findings suggestive of multivessel CAD.
The study also showed moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary systolic hypertension, and right ventricular cavity enlargement.
Pulmonary: Mild SOB occuring after vigorous hydration responded well to pulmonary toilet, nebulizer treatments, and resumption of home diuretic.
[**2151-3-4**] CXR revealed findings consistent with retrocardiac atelectasis, wihtout concern for pneumonia.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
After a single episode of nausea, vomiting on [**3-9**], a KUB/upright was performed, which showed minimal colomic wall edema also seen on prior CT. No bowel obstruction or free air was seen.
Hematology: Upon admission, the patient's home Coumadin prophylaxis for atrial fibrillation was held, and she was given a dose of Phytonadione and 2 units of FFP in the case that operative intervention was indicated.
The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; no blood transfusions were required.
Coumadin prophylaxis for atrial fibrillation was resumed at home dose prior to discharge.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating with assistance, voiding without assistance, and she was not expereincing any pain.
