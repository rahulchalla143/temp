Patient received his cycle 2 of paclitaxel on [**2108-12-5**] and has been experiencing odynophagia from mucositis.
For the past few days he has felt "not well" at home, complaining of intermittent shortness of breath, odynophagia and dysphagia.
However, chest CT without contrast showed moderate pleural effusion with right lower lobe atelectasis, but no evidence of pulmonary edema.
Pneumonia was suspected and patient was started on ceftriaxone and vancomycin.
His CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions.

IMAGING: # Chest CT (OSH) moderate R pleural effusion with RLL atelectasis  # CXR [**12-14**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-12**], there is layering of substantial right pleural effusion.
Probably smaller left pleural effusion shows layering as well.
Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
Underlying lungs are difficult to evaluate, though there are probably at least atelectatic changes at both bases.
# CXR [**12-12**]: IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of a pleural effusion on the right with opacities that can likely be attributed to atelectasis.
Pneumonia cannot be completely excluded, however.
Follow-up radiographs may be helpful for continued evaluation.
Brief Hospital Course: 85-year-old man with Kaposi's sarcoma with visceral involvement, CHF, CKD presents with confusion, dyspnea, odynophagia, generalized weakness.
Goals of Care: Patient was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia to the high 80s from pulmonary edema and the plan to initiate dialysis to remove fluid.
The patient was started on a Morphine drip, Benadryl for itching related uremia, and Haldol for terminal delirium.
Dyspnea: Patient presented with some wheezing on exam, bilateral crackles R>L.
CT showed right-sided pleural effusion.
Intermittently tachypneic but with good O2 saturation.
There is no clear evidence of pneumonia.
Patient does not have significant coughs and the chest CT showed no clear infiltrate.
Patient further received Furosemide given concern for CHF on exam.
Might be due to hospitalization-related delirium in an elderly person, CHF exacerbation, pneumonia.
Head bleed is a possible cause given thrombocytopenia.
Uremia (urea > 100) from CKD was ultimately presumed to be the most likely cause.
The patient was continued on Hydralazine, Labetolol and Ranolazine initially, though these meds were held for hypotension that may likely happen with dialysis.
Odynophagia: Was presumed due to mucositis from recent chemotherapy.
Kaposi's sarcoma with known visceral involvement: Patient was pancytopenic from recent chemotherapy.
Pt was NPO given high risk of aspiration.
