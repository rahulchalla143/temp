's surgery to place a venous access device was postponed because of WBC = 0.8.
denies frank fever, N/V, abdominal pain, joint and muscle pain, presyncope or syncope, hematuria, and bloody stool.
Past Medical History: PAST ONC HX: - Multiple myeloma, Stage IIIA ([**2117-10-6**]):  Presented with hypercalcemia, hematuria, UPEP w/ monoclonal protein --- CT abd with lytic lumbar and sacral lesions --- BMbx with 30-50% plasma cells, elevate IgG Kappa = 6781 - Thalidomide and dexamethasone with response ([**2-9**]) - Stem cell mobilization with high dose cytoxan ([**2118-3-9**]) - AutoSCT with Melphalan ([**2118-5-13**]), c/b neutropenic fever, TPN [**2-4**] mucositis --- Melphalan-associated lung toxicity, treated with high-dose steroids ([**2118-6-6**]) .

[**Name (NI) 4459**]: [**Name2 (NI) 12476**], EOMI, CNII-XII grossly intact CV: RRR, S1S2, no m/r/g Chest: Bibasilar crackles, faint rhonchi and expiratory wheezes.
Dullness to percussion on LLL.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2118-7-15**] 6:36 PM Please note this examination is limited due to marked patient rotation and portable technique.
Given these limitations, no focal underlying consolidation, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, or pleural effusion is identified.
There are slightly prominent interstitial markings projecting over the left hemithorax, which may represent the sequelae of previously identified pneumonia on a recent admission.
IMPRESSION:  No definite focal consolidation identified.
Slightly increased interstitial markings projecting over the left hemithorax may be related to technique or residual opacities from known recently treated pneumonia.
There is interval development of numerous bilateral nodules affecting all five lobes of the lungs.
There also smaller ground-glass nodules.
There are two small areas of consolidation in the lung apices bilaterally.
There is a larger area of consolidation in the left lower lobe and a linear area of scarring or atelectasis in the right lower lobe.
There is no pleural effusion.
Expiratory images show mild air trapping, most pronounced in the lower lobes bilaterally.
Bone windows reveal degenerative changes with no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
New diffuse bilateral pulmonary nodules of varying sizes and density, with two small areas of focal consolidation in the apices bilaterally and a larger area of consolidation in the left lower lobe.
Superimposed bacterial infection is also possible.
No evidence of pulmonary fibrosis.
2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   MULTIPLE ORGANISMS CONSISTENT WITH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2118-7-20**] 8:06 AM FINDINGS: There is a new area of slow diffusion in the right medial occipital lobe and the adjacent portion of the splenium of the corpus collosum.
These findings are most consistent with a subacute infarction.
An infectious process is much less likely given the gyriform nature of the enhancement, and the lack of additional enhancing lesions.
Two small foci of high T2 signal in the deep white matter of the right and left inferior frontal lobes are unchanged, likely representing chronic microvascular disease.
There is a persistent fluid level in the sphenoid sinus.
Mild mucosal thickening is noted in the right frontal, ethmoid, and maxillary air cells, as well as in a left posterior ethmoidal air cell.
Probable subacute infarction involving the right medial occipital lobe and the splenium of the corpus callosum.
An infectious process is much less likely, given the enhancement [**Doctor Last Name 5926**] and the absence of multiple lesions.
Unchanged right sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] mass involving the right cavernous sinus, the pituitary fossa, and extending along the clivus, consistent with a meningioma.
Persistent fluid level in the sphenoid sinus.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 69yo M with h/o Stage IIIB IgG kappa MM d+55 autoSCT who presented with one day history of shaking, elevated temperature, ANC 888, low BP, dullness to percussion on physical exam, and recent ICU admission for melphalan-related lung toxicity.
Pt had a head CT on [**7-28**] that did not show evidence for a bleed.
Then, on [**7-29**] AM, pt was noted to have an increased O2 requirement.
On exam, he was minimally responsive to pain and was found to have a fixed and dilated right pupil.
An emergent head CT was obtained that revealed a new, large right parietal and occipital hemorrhage with extensive mass effect including herniations.
Upon learning the results of the CT scan, Neurosurgery felt prognosis would be poor.
Mental status changes prior to [**7-29**]: This was likely multi factorial given hyponatremia, known infectious process in lung along with findings on MRI suggestive of septic emboli, and toxic-metabolic insults resulting in encephalopathy.
He was admitted to ICU on [**7-26**] due to worsening MS changes with possible trouble protecting airway.
Pt had an EEG that did not show acute foci of seizure activity.
for hazy and yellow fluid, mildly elevated protein, relatively low glucose compared to serum glucose, and WBC of 8 and 4, which is slightly above normal but pt was neutropenic, with lymph predominance, suggesting an infectious process (more likely viral v. [**Month/Year (2) 1065**] then bacterial).
He was on high dose steroids for desired effect of decreasing the lesions in the brain as well as broad spectrum antibiotics Meropenam and Vancomycin as well as acyclovir, voriconazole, and ambisone.
A TEE was attempted pn [**7-27**] to look for evidence of endocarditis; however, the probe could not be passed through his upper esophageal sphincter.
ID:  Patient has pulmonary nodules, which seem improved on CT, and infectious process in lungs (BAL from [**7-20**] grew HSV, moraxella, stentotrophomonas; negative for PCP).
There is also concern for septic emboli on head MR, which seems to have worsen.
Also, pt has developed new firm, erythematous skin lesions and subcutaneous nodules on his LEs and abdomen that are concerning for septic emboli as well.
A lesion was biopsied by dermatology and felt to show vasculitis/panniculitis, which was most likely due to an infectious process.
This was felt to be preseptal/early facial cellulitis vs. erythema [**2-4**] scratching.
Dilated eye exam did not show any evidence for infectious process.
Neutropenia: Pt is s/p autoSCT almost 2 months ago and not on chemotherapy, so, the cause of neutropenia is unknown but suspected to be due to bactrim or infectious process.
Viral studies including CMV and B parvovirus were sent.
Due to concern for possible development of myelodysplastic syndrome, bone marrow aspirate was performed, which revealed hypocellular marrow, likely sulfamethoxazole/trimeth related injury.
Pantoprozale was stopped [**7-21**] due to pancytopenia.
Multiple myeloma, s/p autoSCT:  For prophylaxis pt had been on Bactrim for PCP as has been on high dose steroids for a long time.
He was on double strength Bactrim MWF, but was switched to atovaquone due to neutropenia which he took one day prior to admission.
This was possibly due to bacteremia v. adrenal insufficiency [**2-4**] resected pituitary adenoma.
Pt was fluid resuscitated and placed temporarily on stress dose steroids of Hydrocort 100mg q8 hrs.
His hypotension resolved by [**7-21**] and then was found to be occasionally hypertensive.
Elevated glucose in context of high dose steroids for melphalan lung toxicity: Pt was placed on long-acting insulin (NPH or glargine) with an insulin sliding scale.
Pt did have a tendency to run high.
Panhypopituitarism [**2-4**] transphenoid resection of pituitary adenoma:  Pt was on prednisone, which was occasionally changed to stress dose steroids for hypotension and later in effort to decrease brain lesions.
Pantoprazole 40 mg PRN for heartburn  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: (1) Intracranial hemorrhage (2) Pulmonary aspergillus (3) Pneumonia (4) Pancytopenia (5) Diabetes mellitus [**2-4**] steroid use  Discharge Condition: Expired  Discharge Instructions: None  Followup Instructions: None
