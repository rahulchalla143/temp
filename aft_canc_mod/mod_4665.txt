Admission Date:  [**2173-7-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-8-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-9-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**] Chief Complaint: Febrile and Neutropenia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: RIJ central line placement PICC line placement Portocath placement   History of Present Illness: HPI: 70 yo gentleman with Multiple Myeloma, on chemotherapy, who noted an axillary temperature of 101.7 in the evening of [**7-26**] after receving chemotherapy with Velcade as an outpatient the same day.
He called the hospital and was told to come to the ED for evaluation and treatment of febrile neutropenia.
He denies any cough, SOB, headache, nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, no dysuria.
His CXR (portable): no edema, no infiltrate.
Multiple Myeloma: dx [**5-23**], treated w/ velcade; c/b pancytopenia - baseline creatinine since diagnosis 2.0-3.0.
Hypertension 3.
Hyperlipidemia 4. s/p MVA 5. s/p tonsillectomy at age 19 .
Onc Hx: In [**2173-5-19**] Mr. [**Known lastname 6164**] presented for evaluation of diffuse bone pain.
He had abnormal cells circulating his peripheral smear.
On admission, he was noted to be in acute renal  failure with plasma blast on his peripheral smear.
He had diffuse bony tenderness.
He has been afebrile and stable at home but has had an approximately 55 pounds weight loss over a several month period.
No family history of cancer or heart disease.
Microbiology: Blood culture [**2173-7-27**] - no growth Urine culture [**2173-7-27**] - no growth Blood fungal cultures [**2173-7-28**] - no growth Sputum culture [**2173-7-30**] - GRAM STAIN <10 PMNs and >10 epithelial cells/100X field.
Gram stain indicates extensive contamination with upper respiratory secretions.
POOR QUALITY SPECIMEN.
Imaging: EKG: Sinus tachycardia, Nonspecific ST-T abnormalities Since previous tracing of [**2173-7-14**], rate is increased .
CXR [**2173-7-27**]: Slight increase in pulmonary vascularity without frank pulmonary edema.
A right internal jugular vascular catheter has been placed, terminating in the lower superior vena cava at the junction with the right atrium.
No pneumothorax is evident.
There is vascular engorgement and perihilar haziness, likely due to mild fluid overload.
Attention to this region on followup films would be helpful to exclude atypical pneumonia.
CXR [**2173-7-30**]: Improving congestive heart failure.
Right lower lobe pneumonia.
The imaging characteristics are most consistent with invasive aspergillosis.
Other forms of infection are also possible.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and diffuse mediastinal adenopathy.
Multiple non-obstructing renal stones bilaterally.
Widespread osseous involvement from the patient's known plasma cell leukemia.
Diffuse anasarca.
No pneumothorax is identified.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known firstname 4884**] [**Known lastname 6164**] is a 70-year-old man with Multiple Myeloma and plasma cell leukemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, DM type 2, who presents with fever and neutropenia.
# Fever with Neutropenia: In the ED, the patient had a temperature of 102.9 with a WBC count of 21.1 with 1% Neutrophils (ANC ~210).
There were no localizing signs of infection on examination.
The patient remained febrile and therefore Acyclovir was added since the patient was recently admitted with disseminated zoster.
The patient still remained febrile and Vancomycin and Azithromycin were added as per ID consultation.
On [**2173-7-28**] the patient became progressively tachypneic to the 30s, SBP 140-150s, increasingly tachycardic to the 140s, diaphoretic with O2 saturation of 99% on 1L.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia with no evidence of ischemia, cardiac enzymes were negative x 1.
He continued to have high grade temperatures as high as 103 F. Blood cultures just grew gram positive cocci in clusters.
Repeat CXR the next day revealed a right lower lobe pneumonia.
CT scan was then obtained which showed two focal areas of consolidation, one in the left upper lobe and the other in the right lower lobe, which demonstrate a surrounding ground-glass appearance, most consistent with invasive aspergillosis.
The patient continued to have low grade fevers and baseline tachycardia.
This was considered his baseline due to severe and progressive involvement of his bone marrow.
G-CSF was not thought to be of any use given the degree of bone marrow invasion.
On discharge he had been afebrile for more than 3 days and was markedly improved clinically with stable vital signs.
# Respiratory Alkalosis/Metabolic Acidosis: On admission the patient was noted to have a low bicarbonate level of 16 that later dropped further to 12 on [**7-28**] when the patient was evaluated by the ICU team.
ABG at the time revealed a respiratory alkalosis with a pH of 7.49, pCO2 17 with a concomitant non gap metabolic acidosis.
This was thought to be secondary to tachypneic secondary to sepsis and his underlying pulmonary infection.
In addition, the patient was thought to have renal tubular acidosis either secondary to his multiple myeloma (proximal RTA) or due to chronic renal failure with a persistently low bicarbonate on previous admissions.
With improvement in his respiratory status, repeat blood gases showed a neutral pH and his bicarbonate began to rise steadily up to 17 on discharge, likely due to his resolving pulmonary infection.
No treatment was necessary since the patient's acid-base status improved on its own with treatment of his underlying disease.
# MM/plasma cell leukemia: The patient had been receiving chemotherapy up until this admission with the last dose given on [**2173-7-26**].
During his hospital stay no chemotherapy was given due to his complicated hospital course with persistent neutropenia.
A portocath was placed the day prior to discharge and the patient was advised to follow up in clinic for possible future treatments.
# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia - Thought to be secondary to bone marrow invasion of plasma cells with concomitant chemotherapeutic effects.
No ASA or heparin was given while in hospital except for minimal amounts of heparin to flush central lines.
# Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient has a baseline Cr of [**1-21**].
# HTN - Patient was hypotensive in the ED requiring fluid boluses, on the floor he remained borderline hypotensive requiring IVF.
# DM - The patient was monitored throughout his stay with QID finger sticks with sliding scale insulin.
The patient did not require insulin and his glucose values where consistently within normal limits.
# Hyperlipidemia - Lipitor was held during this admission.
# PPx - Neutropenic precautions, bowel regimen, no heparin due to low plts  # FEN - Neutropenic diet, IVF to maintain BP, electrolytes sliding scale .
