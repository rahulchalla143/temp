HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 59-year-old man with a history of colon cancer that now presents with a sigmoid colectomy in [**2132-8-22**] for a T3-N0 grade 2 adenocarcinoma of the colon.
Recent CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis in [**2134-11-23**] demonstrated a 2 mm nodule in the left lower lobe of the lung that was unchanged from previous CT's in both [**2131**] and in [**2132**].
However, the abdominal CT demonstrated ill defined low attenuation mass near the porta He is now referred for caudate lobe resection.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for the following: Adenocarcinoma of the colon as described above.
Adult onset diabetes mellitus.
In general he is well developed and a well nourished male in no acute distress.
His head, eyes, ears, nose and throat demonstrates no scleral icterus.
Neck was supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
There is no murmur, rub or gallop.
Abdomen demonstrates a well healed low midline incision, there is no hepatosplenomegaly, masses, tenderness or incisional hernia.
His extremities are without peripheral edema and neurologically he is grossly intact.
There, he had a right hepatic lobectomy, cholecystectomy, wedge biopsy of the left lobe, needle biopsy of the left lobe and intraoperative ultrasound.
Neurologic:  The patient had pain control with an epidural that contained both Dilaudid and Bupivacaine.
He became markedly hypotensive with this and required several hours of vasopressive support with a Neo-Synephrine drip.
Cardiopulmonary:  Other than the episode of hypotension that he experienced from his epidural, the patient had no other acute cardiopulmonary events.
GI:  On the evening of his operation, the patient's transaminases were markedly elevated as we expected them to be with an ALT of 2,220 and an AST of [**2041**].
For the entire hospitalization he also received intravenous Zantac for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
The patient did continue to have problems with fever during his postoperative course.
It was ultimately felt that his fever was atelectatic as he had diminished breath sounds in his right base and was limited by pain on taking a deep breath.
Surgical pathology of his intraoperative specimen revealed that he had a normal gallbladder with two lymph nodes demonstrating no evidence of malignancy.
In addition, he had a liver needle biopsy that demonstrated macro and micro vesicular steatosis with no evidence of malignancy.
His wedge biopsy demonstrated a bile duct adenoma and his resected portion of liver demonstrated adenocarcinoma that was moderately differentiated, consistent with a colorectal primary.
The margins of this were 2 mm from the ink resection margin and there is no vascular invasion seen.
Metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma, now status post right hepatic lobectomy.
