Admission Date:  [**2149-5-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-5-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2073-9-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: MED  Allergies: Lovenox / Zyprexa  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**] Chief Complaint: hypotension and gait disturbance  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: fluoroscopically guided lumbar puncture  History of Present Illness: History per chart and patient.
Pt is a 75 yo male with history of recent left temporal lobe CVA, CAD, recent cardiac cath at [**Hospital1 2025**] recently diagnosed hydrocephalus with a 3rd ventricle lipoma who presented to [**Hospital6 4620**] for hypotension and gait disturbances on [**4-30**].
There he was found to have bladder cancer and an appointment was arranged for him to have a definitive resection under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 986**] at [**Hospital3 **].
After the cardiac cath, [**Hospital1 2025**] Neurology treated him for HSV encephalitis although it seems that HSV was never successfully cultured from any spinal fluid.
This treatment with acyclovir, however, resulted in acute renal failure.
On the evening of [**5-18**], he presented to the [**Hospital 55955**] again for hypotension and mental status changes.
Neurology saw the patient and thought that hemodynamic issues were causing the mental status changes and the frontal dementia was secondary to the front infarct and hydrocephalus as demonstrated on another CT. Neurosurgery was consult and they felt a shunt to be unnecessary.
Past Medical History: 1) colelithiasis 2) bladder ca soon to be resected [**5-1**] 3) old left frontal stroke 4) corpus callosum lipoma with hydrocephalus 5) hospital HIT 6) ARF thought to be due to acyclovir 7) DJD of spine 8) osteoarthritis of knee 9) history of PUD status post GI bleed   Social History: 1) cigars 2) [**2-25**] shots of brandy per day 3) 11 children  4) wife alive and speaks for him  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: On admission, the vitals: GEN: lying in bed, no acute distress, appears stated age.
NEURO: II-XII grossly intact without focal lesions.
4/5 strength throughout, with particular weakness on the LUE and LLL [**1-24**] (could not lift leg more than 4 inches off the bed).
No dysmetria on finger to nose.
rapid finger tap normal bilaterally as well as rapidly alternating movements.

Neurology felt the mental status changes could be attributed to a combination of sequelae from the previous CVA and was unsure of normal pressure hydrocephalus.
Of note, the patient has a baseline personality which tends to be slightly aggressive, sarcastic, and "frontally disinhibited".
His wife says that his personality is essentially unchanged s/p CVA but there very well might be an aspect of post infarct personality change.
On [**5-22**], a head MRI was performed at the recommendation of neurosurgery to assess whether the patient had NPH which was causing mental status changes and gait disturbance.
MRI showed a pericallosal lipoma (which was seen on CT [**5-19**]) which extended into the lateral ventricles bilaterally.
Despite a patent aqueduct of Sylvius, there seemed to be mild ventricular enlargement and sulcal widening, both of which were noted to be possibly due to atrophy.
An old left frontal lobe infarction was present with some T2 abnormalities in both cerebral hemispheres, likely representing microvascular infarctions.
No abnormal intracranial enhancement is detected on the post-gadolinium images.
No diffusion weighted studies were performed.
Due to the mild hydrocephalus, neurosurgery remained uncertain about the utility of shunt placement and recommended a large volume lumbar puncture.
Fluoro-guided LP was performed on [**5-23**] at the Pain Clinic without complication and CSF was sent for further study.
There were no WBC and 1 RBC.
The patient remained horizontal for 6 hours without post-tap headache and his gait was tested in front of his family and friends.
It was unclear whether or not gait improved, but the family noted certain improvement in his mental status.
The issue of a shunt placement was discussed with the patient's wife as well as his other family members and it was agreed that they would like to pursue more conservative management of the patient's mental status changes and gait disturbance.
The patient himself was amenable to this and has stated he will keep a mental note of his gait improvement/regression at rehab.
2) Left sided weakness upper and lower extremities: On admission to the floor, the patient was noted to have left sided weakness of his upper and lower extremities.
To follow up, Neurology was consulted and insofar as the MRI findings were not anatomically consistent with left sided weakness, it was thought the patient could have exacerbation of an old right lacunar infarct.
Unfortunately, the results that returned are difficult to interpret given the patient's bladder cancer and vasculitis has not been ruled out.
IV fluids were made ready in case he had a hypotensive episode.
Please consider restarting the patient's ACE inhibiter at rehab or afterward should blood pressures and renal function remain stable as this would likely improve long term cardiac function.
The patient was noted to be iron deficient and this was felt to be secondary to urinary blood loss secondary to the patient's bladder cancer.
He did not complain of chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or lower extremity swelling.
