Admission Date:  [**2137-12-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-12-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-1-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Vicodin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3233**] Chief Complaint: Lower Extremity Weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: C7-L10 Fusion  History of Present Illness: 67F presented to OSH ([**2137-11-30**]) for progressive lower extremity weakness, now POD#4 from C7-L10 Fusion.
In early [**Month (only) **] the pt had severe in the thoracic spine pain while lifting a 20lb [**Country 1073**].
Pain described as sharp pain, radiating bilaterally anteriorly in a band like fashion below her breasts.
The pt took ibuprofen for the pain and later took hydrocodone( which made her nauseous) .
Went to OSH were CT scan revealed T5 and L1 compression fractures, thoracic spinal cord compression, and subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
At [**Hospital1 18**], pt noted to have mild lower extremity weakness, sensory loss below T5 and and bilateral upgoing Babinski.
MRI showed pathologic compression fracture at T5, with diffusely abnormal signal intensity involving vertebral body, pedicles, and laminae.
Also noted was severe spinal cord compression from epidural soft tissue component.
Also a prevertebral soft tissue component and several scattered lesions of increased signal intensity in the spine, including the sacrum, representing metastatic lesions.
Per report the pathology preliminary has revealed sheets of plasma cells consistent with plasmacytoma/multiple myeloma.
History of engorged turbinates status post sinus procedure.
Removal of a ruptured epidermal cyst on right buttock and a dermatofibroma from the left buttock in [**2127**].
History of cystic breast lesions, evaluated by ultrasound.
She has no children.
Family History: Mother: died from acute leukemia in her 60s.
Brother: [**Name (NI) **] 63 Brother: [**Name (NI) **] 60 hx of pulmonary emboli, s/p VATS Maternal Aunt: diagnosed with colon cancer in 70s Maternal Uncle: diagnosed with colon cancer in 70s   Physical Exam: (On Transfer to BMT Service POD#4) Vitals: T: 99.2 BP: 125/70 HR: 70 RR: 16 96 O2Sat: GEN: AOx3, NAD, Well-nourished HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, sclera anicteric, MMM, OP Clear NECK: No JVD, no bruit CARD: S1 S2, no M/G/R, radial pulses +2, minor decrease in sharp sensation along T5 distribution PULM: Lungs CTAB, no W/R/R, Tenderness to palpation left suprascapular area.

Equivocal Babinski tests bilaterally.
BACK: Vertical Wound Dressings C/D/I SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
Diffuse non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.
Severe pathologic compression fracture of T5 vertebra, with diffusely altered areas of signal intensity involving the vertebral body as well as the pedicles on both sides and the laminae on both sides, with significant amount of epidural soft tissue component, overall resulting in severe compression of the cord.
There is also prevertebral soft tissue component, with some enhancement.
Several scattered focal lesions of increased signal intensity on the STIR sequence and enhancement on the post-contrast images in the spine, including the sacrum, representing metastatic lesions.
As the primary malignancy is not known, further workup, to evaluate for primary malignancy is recommended.
Otherwise, CT of the spine- thoracic, and if necessary, cervical and lumbar regions can be considered for better evaluation of bony details.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, with collapse/consolidation of the adjacent portions of the lung, which can be better evaluated with CT chest.
Small 0.8 cm T2 hyperintense lesion, in the left kidney, may represent a cyst but can be better evaluated at time of CT torso.
L- Spine: [**2137-12-1**]: In comparison with the previous study of this date, an extensive  surgical procedure has been performed with multiple rods and hooks extending from C6 through L2.
Skeletal Survey [**2137-12-4**]: There is marked loss of height of the L1 vertebral body.
Several areas of lucency are seen in the posterior aspect of the calvarium.
The views of the appendicular skeleton show no definite lytic lesion.
Note:  The sections are of multiple fragments of bone and soft tissue infiltrated by sheets of plasma cells with focal areas of necrosis.
By immunohistochemistry, CD138 highlights sheets of plasma cells.
In the context of appropriate clinical, laboratory and radiologic findings, this is consistent with features of plasma cell myeloma (see also subsequent bone marrow specimen).
Please correlate with clinical, laboratory and radiologic findings.
Tissue: Immunotyping, Lymph node: Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by a non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
Tissue sections reveal sheets of plasma cells.
Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas as due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.
Bone Marrow Biopsy ([**12-6**]): Cellular marrow with increased plasma cells.
The morphological findings along with the recently diagnosed plasmacytoma (T5) are consistent with a plasma cell dyscrasia/plasma cell myeloma.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo female with h/o osteopenia who presented with back pain and lower extremity weakness and was found to have a plasmacytoma and multiple myeloma.
# Plasmacytoma: The patient on admission was found to have a large mass at T5, with spinal cord compression.
This mass was resected and biopsied and pathology was found to be consistent with a plasmacytoma.
The patient received Decadron 40 mg IV daily for four days, twice, and she will be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further treatment of her plasmacytoma and multiple myeloma.
# Multiple Myeloma: The patient has a history of osteopenia and was found to have a plasmacytoma on admission.
A SPEP was then performed which demonstrated an elevated IgA level.
The patient was also noted to have persistent anemia during this hospitalization, yet her creatinine reamined within normal limits.
# C5-L2 Fusion: The patient presented to an OSH with back pain and lower extremity weakness.
She was found to have a large mass compressing the spinal cord.
The patient was orginally admitted to the Ortho-Spine service, under the care of which she had the mass resected and a C7-T10 fusion on [**12-1**].
# Pain Control: The patient was evaluated by the pain service on this admission.
The patient's pain was well controlled on this medication, and she did not have any acute events during this hospitalization.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every six (6) hours as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you were experiencing back pain and lower extremity weakness.
While you were here, we found that you had a large mass in your spine, a plasmacytoma, and you bone marrow showed evidence of a condition called Multiple Myeloma.
We started you on Lorazepam, as you were noticing significant anxiety and difficulty sleeping 4.
Please return to the ED or your healthcare provider if you experience increasing pain in your back, increasing lower extremity weakness, chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, or any other concerning symptoms.
