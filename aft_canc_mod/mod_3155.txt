STUDIES Renal US: IMPRESSION: Echogenic shadowing material within the collecting system of the right lower quadrant transplanted kidney, suggestive of emphysematous pyelonephritis.
There is no hydronephrosis or abscess.
No new focal fluid collection.
Stable retroperitoneal hematoma in the left iliac fossa and slightly increased size of superficial hematoma adjacent to the right gluteus muscle both represent areas of possible infection.
Air within the collecting system of the right pelvic transplanted kidney may represent infection in the absence of recent instrumentation or reflux of air, but this finding is new from [**2156-2-6**].
Small to moderate left-sided pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis and air bronchograms.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells and fluid in the sphenoid sinus.
Slightly hypodense appearance of the left caudate and left insular cortex is of equivocal significance.
Given the slightly noisy images, the component of cerebral edema cannot be completely excluded.
Chronic-appearing thrombus in one of three brachial veins, unchanged from [**2155-12-1**].
Non-occlusive thrombus in the mid portion of the left cephalic vein is new from [**2155-12-1**] but is otherwise age-indeterminant.
Brief Hospital Course: Pleasant 66 yo female with MMP, hx of kidney liver failure, presented intially to the hospital with recurrent multi-drug resistant UTI, was transferred to the ICU for altered mental status and hypoxemia, electively intubated for LP and CT studies found to have gas pockets in her transplanted kidney.
# Emphysematous Pyelonephritis: She presented with UTI that had grown multidrug resistant klebsiella that was sensitive meropenem.
However she continued to spike fevers and her mental status was noted to be decreased from her baseline.
Urine cultures here did not grow any bacteria but did grow [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] and she was started on Micafungin.
After starting micafungin her fevers stopped and her mental status improved.
She will follow up with ID and urology for further management of her recurrent UTIs.
While she was continuing to spike fevers and had altered mental status she was briefly started on vancomycin in addition to the meropenem for possible aspiration PNA.
# Acute Renal failure: While admitted she was noted to have elevation in her creatinine.
With treatment of her UTI, holding her  psychotropic medications and resolution of hypoxia her mental status returned to her baseline and her tremor resolved.
# Hip Fracture: She recently had a hip fracture that was repaired by ortho in [**Month (only) 1096**].
She was taking dilaudid for pain when she was admitted but this was held in the setting of AMS.
She was later changed to oxycodone as needed, which provided adequate pain control without mental status changes.
has known h/o chronic thrombus in LUE, s/p fistula in RUE so not usable for access.
was noted to have LUE swelling at admission which persisted after PICC placement, non-tender, neurovascularly intact.
US showed stable brachial vein thrombus, PICC in other brachial vein without thrombus, and new thrombus in mid portion of cephalic vein which is not a deep vein.
# HTN: Briefly held her amlodipine and torsemide though these were restarted later.
CHRONIC ISSUES: .
# Hx seizures: Continued keppra, no seizures while inpatient.
# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothroxine.
# Gout: Colchicine and allopurinol were held in the setting of [**Last Name (un) **].
She will need to follow up with urology and ID regarding prevention of future infections.
Her amlodipine was increased to 5 mg [**Hospital1 **] the day prior to discharge if she is persistently hypertensive she may need medication changes as directed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].
Please also check tacrolimus levels twice weekly as we have recently increased her dose.
28. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation .
29. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q12H (every 12 hours) as needed for Anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 1293**] - [**Location (un) 1294**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Emphysematous pyelonephritis Pulmonary edema .
Secondary Diagnoses: History of Kidney transplant History of Liver transplant History of recent hip fracture Recurrent urinary tract infections   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were in the hospital because you had an infection of your kidney and urinary tract.
We treated this infection with antibiotics called meropenem and micafungin.
You were also a little confused while in the hospital.
We believe this was from a combination of your infection and some of the medications you were taking.
We stopped several of these medications.
Summary of Medication Changes: Please Change tacrolimus to 1.5 mg twice a day Please Start meropenem 500 mg three times per day, last dose 2/3 Please Start micafungin 100 mg every day, last dose 2/3 Please Start oxycodone 5 mg every 4-6 hours as needed for pain Please Decrease Lantus (glargine insulin) to 15 units at bedtime Please Decrease venlafaxine to 150mg once a day Please Increase Amlodipine to 5 mg twice daily.
