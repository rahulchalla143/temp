Admission Date:  [**2168-7-29**]     Discharge Date:  [**2168-8-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2105-12-16**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Back pain with shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old female with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and obesity who was transferred here from [**Hospital6 101183**] Home after she complained of chronic midscapular back pain for approximately one month and several days of a nonproductive cough, shortness of breath, slight fevers and chills and increased urination.
She denied any abdominal pain, dysuria, bowel changes, or palpitations.
Also, in the nursing home, she was found to have a Klebsiella UTI sensitive to ciprofloxacin, to be tachycardiac and hypovolemic.
At this point, her systolic blood pressure fell to the 70s and the repeat EKG showed questionable fib versus flutter pattern.
History of atypical chest pain.
History of congestive heart failure.
History of coronary artery disease, status post RCA stent in [**6-20**].
History of small bowel resection.
History of lithium-induced renal failure.
She had an EKG which showed narrow tachycardia of 120 with normal axis.
She had a chest x-ray which showed a left upper lobe pneumonia with a right IJ without pneumothorax.
Her mucous membranes were dry.
Chest:  Distant breath sounds and no wheezing.
Cardiac:  Tachycardia which was regular.
Abdomen: An obese abdomen which was nontender and nondistended with very active bowel sounds.
PULMONARY:  The patient was shown to have a pneumonia for which she was started on levofloxacin and clindamycin for possible aspiration pneumonia.
It was believed that the back pain that she was experiencing was related to her left upper lobe pneumonia.
A CT scan was done on [**2168-7-30**] which showed left upper lobe lingula consolidation and collapse without a patent airway.
The patient was continued on her levofloxacin and Clindamycin which were started on [**2168-7-30**] for a full 14 day course for a possible community-acquired versus aspiration pneumonia.
In terms of her bronchoscopy, she had transbronchial needle aspiration of subcarinal node from the right side.
The patient did have one episode during the course of her hospital admission where she became tachycardiac to the 140s with systolic blood pressures in the 80s and diastolic pressures in the 50s.
She did have an echocardiogram done while here which showed an ejection fraction of 55% and a small highly mobile 2 mm mass on the mitral valve which was fibrinous and calcified that was questionable for either thrombus or tumor.
The echocardiogram also showed an intra-atrial septal aneurysm.
for her new atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter.
It was decided during the course of her hospital admission due to her continuing pulmonary disease that we would not attempt cardioversion or electrophysiology studies at this time.
This drop in hematocrit occurred on the same evening where the patient had runs of tachycardia in the 140s and was given her two 500 and 250 normal saline boluses.
It was believe that part of this drop in hematocrit is secondary to a dilutional effect with these normal saline boluses.
However, her anemia was worked up.
The patient did have some bruising on her abdomen which was suggestive of a possible retroperitoneal bleed.
A CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated no bleeding in the retroperitoneal space or in the femoral areas.
She did not show evidence of congestive heart failure during or after these transfusions.
It is possible that this is secondary to a perineoplastic syndrome in the setting of a patient with a 100 pack year smoking history and a new lung mass.
Her calcium levels remained stable in the 10.0 range and the patient did not have any symptoms of hypercalcemia and did not show .....................  5.
Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter.
Diabetes mellitus.
FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1266**] for results of pulmonary biopsies.
