portal-biliary fistula, obstructive jaundice, pancreatitis w/ likely Klatskin tumor    Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2152-4-3**]: PTC placement [**2152-4-3**]: Hepatic angiogram  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 48 year old Laotian man with a history of chronic alcohol abuse who is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with a possible portal-biliary fistula, obstructive jaundice, and pancreatitis s/p ERCP with stent [**2152-3-31**] to evaluate likely Klatskin tumor.
The patient presented to [**Hospital6 204**] on [**2152-3-28**] with a 1 month history of epigastric pain and a 2 week history of jaundice.
He has a history of heavy alcohol use, but had stopped drinking over the previous 4 weeks because of associated epigastric pain.
He was admitted for further workup and a MRCP was obtained, demonstrating intra-hepatic ductal dilatation with a filling defect at the biliary confluence.
Post-procedurally, the patient developed abdominal pain and RUQ tenderness.
He was noted to have melanotic stools, and serial laboratory studies demonstrated a drop in his hematocrit of ~10 points (from 40 to 29).
Additionally, he was found to have increasing serum bilirubin levels; at the time of transfer his total bilirubin level was 9.2 (increased from 6 at the time of admission to [**Hospital3 **]).
His lipase was also significantly elevated at 1100, and his amylase was 200.
He received 2U FFP and 1U PRBC prior to transfer, and he has been hemodynamically stable without tachycardia or hypotension.

At the outpatient hospital he had undergone ERCP and post procedurally he developed a post ERCP pancreatitis as well as a 10 point Hct drop with grossly melanotic stool with concern for arterio-biliary fistula.
He was noted to have active bleeding into the biliary tree upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**].
A stent had been placed in the right biliary system but the left system remained obstructed at the time of transfer.
On [**4-3**] he underwent a hepatic angiogram which showed no evidence of arterial biliary fistula, but there is a small area of contrast pooling seen on portal venogram in segment VII adjacent to endoscopically placed biliary drain done the same day.
He was treated with one day of Unasyn and Flagyl and was then switched to PO Cipro for prophylaxis.
Capping drain at this time will likely produce fever and possible infection, please leave open to bag draiange Advance diet as tolerated Continue PO Cipro  Followup Instructions: If patient changes his mind about pursuing second PTC placement and surgery, patient can contact Dr [**Name (NI) 4727**] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**]                                [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 707**] MD, [**MD Number(3) 709**]  Completed by:[**2152-4-6**
