OPERATIVE REPORT INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY:  This is a 75-year-old male who presented from an outside hospital with hemodynamic shock.
His history of myeloproliferative disorder was known and he had a CAT scan done at the outside institution which revealed severely injured and spontaneous rupture of his spleen, as well as significant amount of free fluid in the abdomen.
A left subcostal incision was used and brought over slightly to the right of the midline.
Approximately 2 L of old and new blood quickly was suctioned out from the abdomen.
Some omental attachments were also taken off the spleen.
At this point, there was no evidence of any active bleeding.
There was a mild diffuse ooze from the posterior abdominal wall.
There was free fluid over the liver which was old blood and was suctioned out and irrigated.
There was some old blood in the pelvis which was suctioned out and irrigated.
Attention was then placed again to the left upper quadrant where there was still slight diffuse ooze.
There was no evidence of any bleeding from the short gastrics.
The pancreas was visualized and examined and there was no evidence of injury to the tail of the pancreas.
There was no evidence of injury to the colon.
Post-extubation he did exhibit signs and symptoms of delirium.
EKG showed what appeared to be multifocal atrial tachcardia.
He did require a few doses of IV lasix over the course of his hospital stay to decrease some pulmonary edema he developed from his aggressive resuscitation.
Eventually he was weaned to room air, and did not have any further complications.
He did require a few more units of platelets due to his drifiting platelet count.
He was vaccinated prior to discharge  ID: He was given a few doses of Keflex for what appeared to intially be a wound infection but later appeared to be dependent erythema.
He never had any positive cultures  Endo:  Initially was on SSI.
SPLENOMEGALY WITH EXTENSIVE EXTRAMEDULLARY HEMATOPOIESIS CONSISTENT WITH CHRONIC MYELOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDER.
CAPSULAR DISRUPTION CONSISTENT WITH SPLENIC RUPTURE.
Note:  There is extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis.
This finding, combined with massive splenomegaly, is consistent with a chronic myeloproliferative disorder.
Reportedly, the patient had previously been diagnosed with a chronic myeloproliferative syndrome, but no further clinical details were available at the time of admission or thereafter, as his routine health care is conducted at an institution outside of the [**Hospital1 18**] network.
