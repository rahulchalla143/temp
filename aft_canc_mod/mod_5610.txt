No diaphoresis.
The pain does not radiate to his back.
He is unsure if this pain is same as his prior cardiac pain.
His wife gave him simethicone- the pain persisted, and given his history, she gave him aspirin and sublingual nitroglycerin, without change in pain.
The patient has recently had a prostate biopsy within the past two weeks, which showed localized prostate cancer.
He also reports having recent dental work in the past two weeks, and has an implanted piece of gold in his upper teeth.

On arrival to the MICU, patient reported chronic neck, back and leg pain.

Family History: Sister died from CVA, father died at 54 from MI, brother with MI at 80   Physical Exam: Vitals: T 97.8 HR 54 BP 115/51 95 % 2 liters n/c General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL.
No wheezes, rales, ronchi Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly GU: foley in place Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: CNII-XII intact, 5/5 strength upper/lower extremities, grossly normal sensation, gait deferred.
There is no axillary or mediastinal lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria.
There is mild coronary artery calcifications.
No pericardial effusions are present.
The lungs show minimal bibasilar atelectasis and a small focus of scarring in the left upper lobe, unchanged since [**2097**].
A 2 mm and 4 mm nodule in the right upper lobe is unchanged since the previous examination.
No other nodules, effusions or consolidations are present.
Although this examination was not intended for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, the partially imaged abdomen shows a granuloma in the right lobe of the liver and a calcified right adrenal nodule, unchanged.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: The visible osseous structures show no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions or fractures.
There is mild scoliosis of the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
No acute intra-abdominal process.
Diverticulosis, but no diverticulitis.
Atherosclerotic disease of the coronary arteries and intra-abdominal aorta.
Scoliosis and degenerative changes of the lumbar spine.
TTE [**2104-12-22**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Dilated ascending aorta.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2096-10-12**], the ascending aorta is slightly larger and mild PA systolic hypertension is now identified.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
CXR [**2104-12-24**]:  In comparison with the study of [**12-19**], the cardiac silhouette is less prominent and the pulmonary vascularity is substantially improved.
Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the bases.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 99802**] is a 77 yo M with a hx of CAD s/p CABG, HTN, HL, recent diagnosis of prostate cancer who presented to the MICU with chest pain and hypotension.
# Hypotension: Initially, the patient's hypotension in the setting of low grade fevers was concerning for a septic etiology.
However, he only required pressors transiently, and his blood pressure improved significantly with fluid resuscitation.
He was started on Unasyn, as possible sources of infection were thought to be GU and oropharyngeal (patient had recent prostate biopsy and dental work).
He was ruled out for an MI and a PE.
A morning cortisol was low, as was a cortisol stimulation test, raising concern for adrenal insufficiency.
The endocrinology service was consulted, and performed another cortisol stimulation test; several portions of this test were pending at discharge, and the patient planned to follow up in endocrine clinic in several weeks.
# Fevers: During his stay in the MICU, the patient had low grade fevers.
However, no sources of infection were found.
His fevers resolved several days after admission, and he had been afebrile > 72 hours at the time of discharge.
# Chest pain:  The patient initially presented with chest pain, which persisted throughout his hospitalization.
He did have subtle ECG changes when he was hypotensive on admission, and he might benefit from repeat stress testing with imaging as an outpatient.
# Anemia - The patient had a Hct drop from 36 to 31; this was felt to be multifactorial from dilution after fluid resuscitation, phlebotomy and ongoing hematuria related to prostate cancer and recent prostate biopsy.
# Hypoxia - After fluid resuscitation the patient had a small oxygen requirement.
CXR showed interstitial edema and he received several doses of oral furosemide with good urine output.
At discharge, his oxygen requirement had resolved and his ambulatory O2 saturation was in the mid-90s.
# Prostate Ca - Patient reported a recent diagnosis of prostate cancer, with a plan to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 365**] as an outpatient.
# HTN - Anti hypertensives were initially held secondary to the patient's hypotension, but low dose metoprolol was restarted on discharge.
# CAD - Patient was continued on ASA.
# Spinal Stenosis: Continued on home oxycontin and prn oxycodone.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Partial Adrenal Insufficiency Hypotension Acute pulmonary edema   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were seen by endocrinology while in the hospital, and they think that you may have a partial deficiency in cortisol.
