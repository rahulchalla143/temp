She was in her usual state of health until [**2129-5-13**] when she started complaining of diffuse pain not localizing to any particular place in her body.
No nausea, vomiting, chest pain or SOB.
Over the next few days she has become progressively more confused from already poor baseline.
Patient at baseline has significant problems with short term memory, ambulates with a walker.
Per PCP and her family, this is a singnificant change in her mental status and baseline.
IgD multiple myeloma, dignosed [**3-/2129**] when the patient presented with actue renal failure Cr 6.8 and hypercalcemia 2.
Colon CA Duke's C2 s/p resection in [**2111**]; normal C-scope in [**2125**] except for diverticulosis 3.
Thalassemia trait, microcytic anemia 4.
HTN 5.
Seizure [**2129-4-3**] [**3-2**] right parafalcine parietal hemorrhage.
Etiology for bleed was not clear as location is atypical for HTN bleeding.
There was concern for intracranial mass and the patient was scheduled for outpatient f/u with neurosurg [**5-16**].
Polycystic kidney disease and polycystic liver disease 8.
Her daughter had polycystic kidney disease.
HEENT: NC, AT, sclera non-icteric, PERRL, OP clear, no lesions NECK: Supple, with no JVD, lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.

Neuro/Psych: oriented to self and place only, but selects [**2129**] from 3 choices, poor attention, + perserverence, able to answer some questions appropriately but at times does not make sense, looses train of thought  Pertinent Results: [**2129-5-16**] 07:50AM   WBC-9.9 RBC-4.32 HGB-11.5* HCT-37.0 MCV-86 MCH-26.7* MCHC-31.1 RDW-16.2* [**2129-5-16**] 07:50AM   PLT COUNT-422 [**2129-5-15**] 09:54PM   LACTATE-2.1* [**2129-5-15**] 09:22PM   GLUCOSE-125* UREA N-55* CREAT-3.4* SODIUM-142 POTASSIUM-5.8* CHLORIDE-110* TOTAL CO2-19* ANION GAP-19 [**2129-5-15**] 09:22PM   ALT(SGPT)-18 AST(SGOT)-19 LD(LDH)-310* ALK PHOS-194* AMYLASE-66 TOT BILI-0.6 [**2129-5-15**] 09:22PM   LIPASE-33 [**2129-5-15**] 09:22PM   NEUTS-90.7* BANDS-0 LYMPHS-7.0* MONOS-2.2 EOS-0 BASOS-0  IgD level [**5-12**] pending (60 on [**2129-4-18**])  Urinalysis: [**2129-5-16**] 06:04AM URINE  COLOR-Yellow APPEAR-SlHazy SP [**Last Name (un) 155**]-1.015 [**2129-5-16**] 06:04AM URINE  BLOOD-LGE NITRITE-NEG PROTEIN-30 GLUCOSE-NEG KETONE-NEG BILIRUBIN-NEG UROBILNGN-NEG PH-5.0 LEUK-MOD [**2129-5-16**] 06:04AM URINE  RBC-36* WBC-38* BACTERIA-NONE YEAST-MANY EPI-0  NCHCT [**5-16**]: Resolving hemorrhage with area of decreased attneuation in the right medial parietal lobe.
No areas of acute hemorrhage.
No evidence of acute territorial infarction or hydrocephalus.
Unchanged left parafalcine meningioma at cranial vertex.
KUB (supine) [**5-16**]: No evidence of stool impaction.
Soft tissue masses occupying the upper abdomen displacing bowel inferiorly, unchanged from previous study.
CXR [**5-16**]: No evidence of pneumonia.
A 5 mm enhancing nodule within the 7 cm upper pole left renal cyst, concerning for an intracystic neoplasm.
Numerous complex nonenhancing cystic liver lesions and biliary ductal dilatation in the left lobe, most likely secondary to compressive effects of these cysts.
Bilateral adrenal adenomas.
Small ascites, bibasilar pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis.
Vertebral body changes, which may be consistent with multiple myeloma.
As part of work up for fever, the patient had CXR on admission w/o infiltrate.
The patient was empirically on Levaquin very briefly for presumed UTI but it was discontinued when cultures showed no growth.
The patient then developed diarrhea and her stool culture return positive for c diff toxin and she was started on Flagyl po.
She had no hisotry of recent outpatient antibiotic use.
CT abd/pelvis showed findings thickening of bowel wall in the transverse, descending, sigmoid, and mildly in the rectum that are most suggestive of colitis.
Multiple myeloma with leptomeningeal involvement.
The patient was noted to have urinary retention, progressive leg weakness and decreased rectal tone.
Leg weakness progressed to the point that the patient was unable to move her legs or get out of bed.
She had MRI of the lumbar spine to evaluate for cauda equina which revealed a nodule at L3 that enhanced with gadolinium.
LP was pursued and revealed CSF protein markedly elevated at 166, glc normal.
Mental status changes.
The etiology for the patient's mental status changes were presumed to be likely multifactorial due to infection with c diff, dehydration, constipation.
Because of h/o seizures secondary to intracranial bleed in [**2129-3-29**], EEG was pursued per suggestion of Neuro Oncologist and revelaed increased stage II sleep concerning for early encephalopathy.
Then, on [**5-30**] patient became minimally responsive with bp drop to low 80's sbp with transient response to fluids.
On admission to ICU, etiology of altered mental status and hypotension was attributed to hypovolemia +/- ?infection in addition to leptomeningeal spread of her disease.
She was placed in stress dose steroids (althoiugh her am cortisol was 34 and adrenal insifficency was unlikley), levo/ flagly and placed on levophed.
Likely due to worsened renal fx and constipation.
Acute on chronic renal failure (Cr 2.9 on [**2129-5-12**] and 3.4 on admission).
likely combination of prerenal from poor po intake and from nephropathy secondary to MM.
The patient has been hypotensive during this admissino.
She was given IVF for BP support and eventually was transfered to the unit (see section under altered mental status).
Renal lesion seen on MRI [**2129-3-29**] concerning for malignancy  8.
Metabolic acidosis - likely secondary to diarrhea, tubular disease and inability to reabsorb bicarb, large amounts of NS given for hydration.
Metabolic disturbances were corrected with bicarb as needed.
This was presumed to be due to free water deficit from decreased po intake.
