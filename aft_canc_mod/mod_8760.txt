No evidence of uncal herniation.
Head CT [**5-29**](Post-op): IMPRESSION: Small amount of hemorrhage surrounding the resection cavity in the right frontal lobe with moderate-to-large amount of bifrontal pneumocephalus, causing mild-to-moderate sulcal effacement in the bilateral frontal lobes.
There is residual intraventricular hemorrhage and pneumocephalus, unchanged since the prior head CT.
There is also persistent midline shifting towards the left with approximately 5.9 mm of deviation.
Heterogeneous enhancement is identified in the surgical cavity with restricted diffusion, raising the possibility of a residual mass lesion.
Small amount of subdural fluid is noted bilaterally in the frontal regions.
Mucosal thickening is identified in the ethmoidal air cells and left maxillary sinus as described above.
