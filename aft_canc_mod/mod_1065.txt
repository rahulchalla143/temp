The patient was discharged 2 days prior to admission ([**2112-6-30**]) after hospitalization for febrile neutropenia, complicated by ARF requiring HDx4 sessions and features of POEMS syndrome relapse.
At home, the patient had a low grade temp yesterday to 100.3 with chills and then another fever to 101.2 this afternoon.
The wife notes that he was complaining of increased pain in his lower extremities (neuropathy) and had decreased PO intake.
He became increasingly lethargic and weak to the point that they had difficulty getting him out of bed.
The patient was lethargic, but arousable to voice, complaining of generalized body pains.
Patient had brown, turbid urine in his foley.
CXR showed persistent L basilar opacification.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: POEMS syndrome manifested by polycythemia, polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathies including hypocalcemia, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism and elevated PTH (diagnosed in [**2099**]).
[**4-/2108**]/[**2108**]: Bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 days 1,4,8,11 and dexamethasone (20 mg days 1,2,4,5,8,9, 11, and 12) x three cycles discontinued due to painful lower extremity neuropathy.
[**4-/2112**]: bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showed dysplastic basophilic and polychromatophilic erythroblasts, a marked left shift and dysplastic myelopoiesis and abundant hyperchromic megakaryocytes, which initially were felt to be consistent with colchicine toxicity; however, chromosome studies performed on that bone marrow material revealed an abnormal karyotype 15/16 studied cells showed a complex clone with the following anomalies.
These were all consistent with a myeloid abnormality since there were not an increased number of blasts much more consistent with MDS.
His manifestations have been as follows: A. Polyneuropathy - CIDP in [**2099-6-6**]; Painful lower extremity sensory neuropathy and proprioception defects.
B. Organomegaly - Splenomegaly C. Endocrinopathy - Hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, hypocalcemia related to hypoparathyroidism D. Monoclonal gammopathy E. Skin and nail changes - now resolving.
F. Pulmonary hypertension and restrictive lung disease.
G. Chronic renal insufficiency (which has now resolved with therapy) H. Anasarca, now resolved.
I. Hyperuricemia and gout - now resolved J. Polycythemia and thrombocythemia - now resolved 2.
S/p tracheostomy [**2101**] 5. prostate cancer s/p brachytherapy 6. gout 7. pulmonary HTN and restrictive lung disease 8. chronic kidney disease 9.
Acute angle glaucoma ([**2112-4-27**])  Social History: Pt is a Ukrainian refugee who immigrated to the US in [**2049**].

His pain was controlled with the addition of increased gabapentin, addition of methadone and oxycodone.
As his pain would worsen when the steroids were weaned off, he was kepts on 3mg po dexamethasone as a stable dose for one week prior to discharge.
During this hospitalization he required multiple blood transfusiosn and platelet transfusions and for a period of time was transfusion dependent.
He had no adverse reactions to any of his blood product transfusions.
-Will require frequent lab work to determine if transfusions are required -Will continue revlimid 10mg po qday  #Dysuria- patient has significant dysruia and negative UA with unclear source of the pain.
-continue methadone, oxycodone -Continue oxybutinin, pyridium and urojets as needed for the pain -consider urology consult if persists  Neutropenic fevers- no clear source of his fevers.
He was found to have hemoptysis and was Bglucan positive so was started on voricanozole and continues this at the time of discharge.He was on IV Vancomycin and meropenem and these were weaned off in the week prior to discharge and he was switched to ciprofloxacin 500mg po BID a few days prior to discharge and remained afebrile with stable WBC.
-Continue voricanozole -Continue ciprofloxacin  # Respiratory Failure: Patient was intubated in the ED to allow for aggressive volume resuscitation.
He was extubated without problem and has no oxygen requiremnet at the time of discharge.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Patient had elevated Cr to 3.7 at the beginning of his admission which was a combination of prerenal and ATN.
# Elevated Troponin: Pt had three sets of elevated troponins (0.06, 0.07, 0.08) but CK-MBs were normal.
He also had some initial EKG changes that resolved.
He likely had some demand ischemia in the setting of [**Last Name (un) **].
He was chest pain free throughout his course .
# Hyperbilirubinemia: T bili and direct bili were elevated.
A right upper quadrant u/s was performed that showed no evidence of cholestasis.
His Alk phos continued to uptrend during the end of his hosptial stay with no localizing symptoms.
-This will be monitored by Dr.[**Doctor Last Name **] office  # Volume overload: Secondary to new left ventricular dysfunction and acute systolic heart failure as well as POEMS syndrome with likely capillary leak, hypoalbuminemia, and initial aggressive volume resuscitation.
Patient was grossly volume overload after his resuscitaion which had resolved at the time of discharge without an elevated JVP or peripehral edema.
13. oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for severe pain: hold for sedation or rr<10.
16. lidocaine HCl 2 % Gel Sig: One (1) Appl Mucous membrane TID (3 times a day) as needed for penile pain.
21. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: POEMS,  Severe Sepsis, Respiratory Failure, MDS Secondary: BPH, Type II Diabetes Mellitus   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 34698**], You were admitted to the hospital because you were very short of breath and having fevers.
Here we worked to help manage your pain and treat your fungal pneumonia with IV antibiotics.
On a couple of occasions your blood pressure got low and you were feverish and were treated in the ICU for this.
While you were here you received multiple blood and platlet transfusions while your counts were low without problems.
Transitional Issues: Pending labs/studies: None Medications started: Voricanozole (antifungal) Ciprofloxacin (antibiotic) Revlimid Dexamethasone Oxycodone (as needed pain medication) Methadone (pain medication twice a day) Senna Colace Oxybutinin (help with bladder spasm) Terazosin (help with BPH) Pyridium (help with pain on urinating) urojet (numbing medicine for pain with urinatng) midodrine- (for dizziness on standing) Ondansetron- as needed for nausea  Medications changed: INCREASED citalopram from 10mg once a day to 20mg once a day INCREASED Gabapentin from 300mg to 600 mg  Medications stopped: STOPPED allopurinol STOPPED Doxazosin (on terazosin instead) STOPPED Timolol eye drops (no longer needed) STOPPED Percocets (on oxycodone and methadone instead)  Follow-up needed for: 1.
