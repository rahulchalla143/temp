He did not check blood sugars but approximately 2 weeks ago he developed chills and shakes and was brought to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 392**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where he was found to have a pneumonia and [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] blood sugar.
However, he continued to have [**Hospital1 **] BS and was noted to be more tired with decreased PO intake and dehyration.
EKG with TWI in inferiolateral leads and cardiac enzymes were sent.
The patient also related some increasing SOB today as well as intermittent chest discomfort over the past few days, and a CTA was performed which showed a large pulmonary embolism.
Bedside ECHO done by the ED attending showed some evidence of right heart strain per the ED resident, but no documentation of this.
He was started on heparin and tranferred to the ICU for monitoring.
Currently the patient has left flank discomfort but no chest pain or pleuritic pain.
+ abdominal pain and tenderness that is chronic for pancreatic cancer.
No fevers, chills, nausea, emesis, dysuria, or other symptoms.

# Pancreatic head tumor seen on [**2174-12-1**], pancreatic biopsy [**2174-12-29**] positive for adenocarcinoma likely of pancreatobiliary origin.
Admission in [**2-3**] for nausea/emesis and found to have gastric/small bowel obstruction and underwent surgery (specifics unclear as history is from son) to relieve obstruction.

Massive pulmonary embolism with pulmonary emboli noted within the main, right and left pulmonary artery and their subsegmental branches.
This is associated with the straightening of the ventricular septum, which suggests increased right heart pressure.
Diffuse panlobular emphysema of both lungs with multiple bulla.
Massive ascites.
Enhancing lesion in the liver dome is new compared to prior abdominal CT and is concerning for metastasis.
In the right lower extremity, there is non-occlusive thrombus formation in the superficial femoral vein.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion located posterior to the basal inferolateral segment of the left ventricle.
There is a small amount of fluid anterior to the right ventricle also.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Small pericardial effusion located posterior to the inferolateral wall with some fluid also anterior to the right ventricle.
No echo signs of tamponade.
with HTN, hypercholesteremia, pancreatic cancer, renal cell cancer and recent pneumonia who presents with hyperglycemia and was found to have a pulmonary embolism.
# Pulmonary embolism ??????
While awaiting assurance of coverage for long term lovenox by his insurance, he was started on coumadin, in the case that the Lovenox was rejected.
No IVC filter was pursued, this was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his primary oncologist.
ECHO showed small pericardial effusions but no tamponade and no evidence of right heart strain from the PE.
# Hyperglycemia- The was likely in the setting of recent infection, steroids, worsening pancreatic function.
# Pancreatic cancer ??????
# HTN ??????
Continue home regimen  # Hypercholesteremia ??????
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with any shortness of breath, chest pain, bleeding in your stool, or other concerning symptoms.
