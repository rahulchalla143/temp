ECG Study Date of [**2146-10-3**]  6:22:00 AM Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Diffuse non-specific  ST-T wave flattening.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2142-9-29**] the lateral ischemic appearing T wave abnormalities are no longer recorded.
Atrial fibrillation has appeared.
Edematous, erythematous antral fold noted consistent with inflammation and possibly underlying ulcer.
A single non-bleeding 2 mm ulcer was found in the stomach body.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 57230**] is a 67 yo male with history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hypertension and multiple myeloma s/p recent chemo.
He has a known duodenal ulcer and presented with  melena and hypotension (SBP 80's) to an outside hospital.
He also complained of chest pain with lateral ST depressions noted on EKG that resolved when he received nitroglycerin and 2 units PRBCs.
On initial evaluation in the emergency room he had a hematocrit of 24 despite the 2 units PRBCs from the outside hospital and was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate greater than 100.
While in the ICU, his atrial fibrillation was controlled with metoprolol IV and reinstitution of his sotalol.
The patient had one further episode of chest tightness that resolved with nitrates as he received an additional 4 units of PRBC's with his hematocrit stabalizing in the low 30's.
He was ruled out for an MI and remained stable from a cardiac standpoint after that single episode.
He had no further melena or guaiac positive stools in the ICU and underwent EGD on [**2146-10-4**] with the results as noted above.
On [**Hospital 57232**] transfer to the hospital floor on [**2146-10-5**], he had a transient episode of hypotension with a pressure of 85/58 when he was transferring from the stretcher to the bed, which was attributed to the patient having restarted his home dose of labetalol on the evening of transfer.
# GI bleed: EGD: edematous, erythematous antral fold noted c/w inflammation and possibly underlying ulcer; single non-bleeding 2 mm ulcer was found in the stomach body.
On the 4th and 5th hospital days following transfer from the ICU, the patient had an episode of black tarry stool on each day.
In consultation with the GI service, these episodes were felt to be due to old blood from his initital upper GI bleed.
His hematocrit and blood pressure remained stable over the course of these two days with no further evidence of new bleeding.
# Chest pain: The patient's episode of chest tightness was felt to be demand ischemia related to GI bleed superimposed on atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response.
Pain improved with SL nitroglycerin and blood transfusions.
# Atrial fibrillation:  The patient has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation treated with sotalol and labetalol.
His rapid ventricular response at the outside hospital appeared related to hypovolemia and ischemia from his GI bleed.
On the last hospital day, he has been restarted on a lower dose of his labetalol (in addition to sotalol) to prevent further rapid ventricular response, but his dose is limited by his earlier hypotensive episodes.
He received a single dose of each on the 4th hospital day just prior to having two further guaiac positive, melenic stools.
Although, the stools are thought to be from old blood and the patient's hematocrit has remained stable, his anticoagulation was discontinued.
These had been held in the setting of his hypotension and GI bleeding and only clonidine and labetalol have been reinstituted at the time of discharge.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a bleeding ulcer that required intensive care because your blood pressure was low.
You were treated with blood transfusions and a new medicine to decrease your stomach acid production.
Your anemia and low blood pressure caused you to have chest pain from your heart disease and caused your heart to beat fast from your atrial fibrillation (afib).
There are no signs that you had a heart attack.
In the setting of your bleeding, your blood thinners for your afib and heart disease were stopped.
Because your blood pressure has been low, we have stopped most of your high blood pressure medicines.
