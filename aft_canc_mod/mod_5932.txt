He tolerated the procedure well without any complication.
On the floor, he developed hypotension and orthostatic symptoms with systolic blood pressure in the 80s and decrease in urine output.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a severe resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Small, hyperdynamic left ventricle with mild symmetric LVH with severe thickening of the basal septum.
There is a severe resting LVOT gradient.
No systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve.
V/Q scan [**3-16**]: Low likelihood ratio for recent pulmonary embolism  CT Abd/pelvis:  No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma   Brief Hospital Course: On post operative day 2, he developed hypotension and orthostatic symptoms with systolic blood pressure in the 80's.
A medicine consult was obtained given his persistent hypotension and low urine output.
Around that time he also was noted to have a new sinus tachycardia.
Give the persistent hypotension, he was given a bolus of heparin over a concern of a pulmonary embolism.
There was no evidence of bleeding at the surgical site or elsewhere.
It was felt that his hypotension was a combination of poor PO intake peri- and post-operatively, coupled with fluid shifts from surgery and possible reaction to his pain medications on post-operative day 2, as he had a macular truncal rash at that time.
His creatinine had bumpted from 0.9 to 1.9 at time of ICU transfer, however had returned to baseline after intravenous fluids and normalization of his blood pressure.
It was suspected that he likely developed some ATN secondary to hypovolemia and maintaining his home anti-hypertensive regimen post-operatively.
He continued to have an unexplained tachycardia.
A V/Q scan was low probability for pulmonary embolism.
His pain was well controlled.
There were no features to suggest an aortic dissection.
A transthoracic echo was obtained that demonstrated a small left ventricle, however it was unclear how this would contribute acutely to his symptoms.
There was no evidence of bleeding at the site of surgery, and repeated hemolysis laboratories were within normal limits.
A CT of his abdomen and pelvis was without any evidence of bleeding.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
His anemia was thought to be multifactorial, from baseline ACD possibly exacerbated by dilution from IVF and some post-op bleeding.
He was also noted to have fevers during his ICU stay.
Urine and blood cultures demonstrated no growth, and a chest x-ray was unremarkable.
He had no localizing signs of infection so antibiotics were not started.
His blood pressure medications were restarted without complication.
