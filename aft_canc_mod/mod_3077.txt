Admission Date:  [**2149-9-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2149-9-20**]    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81-year-old female admitted with an unknown past medical history who was transferred from an outside hospital secondary to hypothermia to 86 degrees Fahrenheit.
The patient was found hypothermic with a body core temperature of 86 degrees Fahrenheit and hypoglycemic with a fingerstick blood glucose brought to [**Hospital 26200**] Hospital where she was found to have a blood alcohol level of 320 with a persistent temperature in the mid 80s degrees Fahrenheit.
The patient was initially seen by the Trauma Surgery team, and a subsequent pelvic x-ray was obtained without evidence of pelvic fracture.
The son was not aware of his mother's current alcohol abuse; although, he reported a vague recollection of previous abuse.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Past medical history on admission was unknown; however, based on subsequent conversations with the patient's primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient has a past Medical History significant for hypertension and alcohol abuse.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies (per son's recollection).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination on admission revealed vital signs (in the Intensive Care Unit) with a temperature of 98.6 (previously 86 degrees Fahrenheit in the field), blood pressure was 112/46, heart rate was 108, respiratory rate was 16, oxygen saturation was 94% on a 50% nonrebreather.
The patient's speech was slurred; however, the patient was noted to be following commands and in no acute distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic with multiple contusions on the face.
Neck examination revealed supple with the absence of jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.
Pulmonary examination revealed lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly with no wheezes, rhonchi, or rales.
No organomegaly appreciated.
Extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Neurologic examination revealed the patient was noted to be somnolent but arousable with physical stimuli and oriented to name only; no gross motor or sensory deficits were noted on examination.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories on admission revealed complete blood count with a white blood cell count of 160,000, hematocrit was 41.2, with a mean cell volume of 108, and platelets were 108.
Smear was notable for multiple smudge cells.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  On admission, a trauma pelvic film with no signs of fracture.
A chest x-ray on admission was notable for borderline congestive heart failure with no pulmonary infiltrates.
Electrocardiogram on admission revealed a normal sinus rhythm with no ST-T wave changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was initially admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where the patient's core body temperature normalized with continuous warming measures without noted cardiac complications.
An arterial line and central venous access (left subclavian) were placed for close monitoring and rapid treatment.
The patient's hypothermia on admission was of unclear etiology with a differential diagnosis including hypothyroidism, sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, alcohol intoxication, hypoglycemia, as well as insulin overdose.
While the etiology was not clear on admission, these processes were considered throughout the remainder of the hospitalization with regard to workup.
HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY SYSTEM:  The initial laboratory work on admission was notable for a profound monoclonal lymphocytosis with a white blood cell count of 160,000 and 90% monoclonal lymphocytes.
The Hematology/[**Hospital **] Clinic was consulted and suggested chronic lymphocytic leukemia as the most probable diagnosis based on smudge cells found on peripheral blood smear, the absence of bands on white blood cell differential, and the absence of obvious lymphadenopathy.
However, Hematology/Oncology could not rule out other etiologies; and blood work was sent for cytology and cytogenetic studies.
Staging abdominal, pelvic, and thoracic CAT scans were remarkable only for small mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy without evidence of organomegaly (including liver and spleen).
The patient was noted to have a macrocytic anemia during the hospitalization with an initial hematocrit of 41, with a mean cell volume of 108; which, following intravenous fluid repletion, subsequently decreased to a hematocrit ranging from 29 to 31.
The patient's macrocytic anemia was felt to likely be multifactorial due to most likely to nutritional deficiencies, alcohol abuse, as well as potential primary bone marrow processes.
On [**9-18**], the patient demonstrated an acute onset of left upper extremity swelling distal to the patient's subclavian central line.
The swelling progressively increased throughout the course of the day, and a subsequent left upper extremity ultrasound demonstrated a large cephalic vein blood clot extending from approximately the elbow to the mid upper arm with complete distal occlusion.
The elevated INR was felt likely related to the supratherapeutic PTT; however, the patient was also on antibiotics which may have contributed.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was hypothermic on admission; however, after rewarming the patient remained normothermic/afebrile during the initial 24 hours of admission without obvious evidence of infection.
Although the lymphocytosis was potentially related to a profound viral illness, it was felt more likely related to a primary hematologic process.
The patient was noted to have a low-grade temperature on hospital day two in the setting of hypertension and agitation.
The patient was subsequently started on empiric levofloxacin for concern of potential pneumonia in an amino-compromised patient.
The patient remained afebrile for the remainder of the hospitalization with no further evidence of infection.
No further hormonal abnormalities were noted.
A head CAT scan on admission was without evidence of acute bleed and/or mass.
There was no evidence of withdrawal with persistent CIWA scores of 0 to 2 throughout the 5-day hospitalization.
RENAL SYSTEM:  The patient presented with an anion gap, lactic acidosis, with an initial arterial blood gas with a pH of 7.17, bicarbonate of 18, a PCO2 of 39, and a PO2 of 147 on 2 liters nasal cannula, with a lactate of 5.5.
The lactic acidosis slowly resolved with fluids with a closure of the anion gap on hospital day two.
The patient reported a poor appetite, however, tolerated an oral diet without nausea or vomiting.
HOSPITAL COURSE IN SUMMARY:  In summary, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension found unconscious, hypothermic, hypoglycemic, with lactic acidosis in the setting of alcohol intoxication; now with profound monoclonal lymphocytosis likely secondary to chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Presumed diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
