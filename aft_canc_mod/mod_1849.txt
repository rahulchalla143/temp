Admission Date:  [**2128-9-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-11-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2051-9-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**] Chief Complaint: Rectal bleed, change in MS, CHF  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 76 y/o male w/ h/o rheumatic heart dz s/p mechanical mvr/avr, afib (s/p VVI PPM); h.o CHF; s/p recent admit to [**Hospital1 18**] for 7 wks (work up for valve leakage included TTE, TEE, MRI showing 2+ MR perivalvular leakage; s/p cath x 2 with stenting of RCA and LAD; s/p VVI pacemaker for chronic afib and prolonged attempts of diuresis) who is being transferred from OSH today after admission for hemorrhoidal bleed s/p surgical I and D of thrombosed hemorrhoid on [**9-6**], followed by normal colonoscopy on [**9-8**].
Since colonoscopy patient has had persistent increased somnolence despite attempts to reverse sedatives with Narcan.
Patient was also found to have peri-rectal abscess but not transferred on antibiotics.
During the same admission the patient was noted to be in acute on chronic renal failure with Creat.
CAD - s/p cath [**2128-7-30**]:stenting of the RCA with 3 overlapping cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]  -[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] [**2128-8-11**]: rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the LAD/LCX.
CHF - EF >55% 2+MR perivalvular, RV dysfunction, moderate pulmonary HTN 4.
Chronic mechanical hemolysis 8.
of perirectal abscess s/p surgery  Social History: no hx of etoh or tobacco, lives at home alone, widower.
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: Temp 98.8 BP 112/60 Pulse 60 Resp 34 O2 sat 98% on 4LNC Gen - Elderly male in moderate respiratory distress.
HEENT - PERRL, extraocular motions intact, anicteric, mucous membranes moist Neck - JVD to jaw, no cervical lymphadenopathy Chest - diffuse wheezing, decreased breath sounds at the right base more than the left CV - Mechanical S1/S2, RRR, [**2-28**] holosystolic murmer Abd - Distended, hypertympanic, +BS, NT, no rebound or guarding.
Back - No costovertebral angle tendernes Extr - 1+ non-pitting edema.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2128-7-22**], there has been no significant change.
PERSANTINE MIBI  [**2128-10-13**] IMPRESSION: A moderate to severe, fixed perfusion defect of the inferior and inferolateral myocardial walls and apex.
Compared to the previous scan, the previously reversible perfusion defect in this region is now fixed and the apical perfusion defect has become more severe.
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a right-dominant circulation with three-vessel coronary artery disease.
LAD had a widely patent proximal stent, and was subtotally occluded in the very apical portion (slightly progressed from prior study).
LCx had a 60% origin stenosis at the site of prior PTCA, and a 70% lesion in a small-caliber mid-vessel.
RCA had a 40% origin stenosis, a 50% distal stenosis, and a 70% lesion in the posterolateral branch.
Left ventriculography was deferred because of renal insufficiency and presence of aortic valve prosthesis.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mild pulmonary hypertension (39/16 mmHg), minimally elevated filling pressures (mean RA 6 mmHg, mean PCWP 12 mmHg), and a preserved cardiac index of 2.9 L/min/m2.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Minimally elevated filling pressures with preserved cardiac output.
Congestive heart failure.
Brief Hospital Course: # CHF - On admission we placed a right IJ triple lumen catheter for adequate access.
He was diuresed with these agents for several days with good output and weight loss.
He remained net even for few days but became slightly overloaded as he required multiple transfusion for his anemia.
If his hyperkalemia resolves or if pt is hypokalemia, would recommend adding back spironolactone.
Pt's BUN also elevated, likely due to diuresis.
Pt should have electrolytes checked periodically at rehab and, if renal function worsens, consider decreasing lisinopril dose.
# CAD - Upon admission he had a troponin of 0.02, it was likely due to subendocardial ischemia from increased demand.
Pt was hypotensive during diuresis and was started on Dopa both for BP support and diuresis.
# Heme - He has a history of chronic anemia [**1-26**] MDS and mechanical hemolysis.
Then he developed more brisk drop in Hct compared to before requiring almost transfusion 1-2x/week.
Hematology was consulted for his condition to rule out other etiology.
His anemia has three component.
1)mechanical hemolysis  2)MDS  3)anemia of chronic illness (by Iron studies).
The major part of the acute drop is from mechanical hemolysis.
The echo does not show any change in the perivalvular leakage of the mitral valve, and it was unlcear why his anemia has progressed.
After getting the increased EPO dose, pt 's Hct remained stable at 30-34 with increased retic count.
# Rhythm  - He has chronic afib s/p VVI pacer [**2128-8-12**].
At this hospitalization there was some question of the utility of BiV upgrade to help with CHF management.
# Mechanical valve -  Coumadin was initially held and he was maintained on a Heparin drip while he had to get central line placed for the CHF management.
Blood cultures were checked to rule out endocarditis and were all negative.
# Change in mental status - Upon presentation from the OSH Mr. [**Known lastname 11215**] was disoriented and changed from his baseline.
He got a stat head CT to evaluate for possible bleed or stroke which was normal.
He was started on Levo/Flagyl given history of colonoscopy and recent perirectal abscess.
He had an elevated LDH which was felt to be secondary to his known mechanical hemolysis.
All sedating meds were held given the history of recent sedation for colonoscopy immediately prior to change in MS.  His ABG indicated hypercarbia which could be causing his change in MS.  His oxygen was decreased and he was maintained at an O2 sat between 92-94%.
# Hypercarbia - He was hypercarbic on his initial ABG.
There was evidence of CO2 retention as hypercarbia improved with decreased FIO2.
# Perirectal abscess - There was no evidence of fluctuance or drainage on exam.
# Ileus - Upon initial evaluation he was seen to have enlarged bowel loops on abdominal x-ray.
He tolerated solid food well and there was no need for further evaluation.
