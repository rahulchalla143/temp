The patient required intubation during this first hospital stay secondary to respiratory failure.
The patient developed a MRSA bacteremia and was started on Vancomycin.
On [**2125-10-27**] the patient returned to [**Hospital1 18**] for headaches and fevers.
The patient was found to have a reaccumulated subdural hematoma, a temp to 103.8, and was started on vanc, ceftriaxone, flagyl, (having had completed a fourteen day course of vanco on [**10-28**] for MRSA pneumonia) switched to vanco, ceftaz, flagyl on [**11-1**] to better cover pseudomonas after subdural hematoma evacuation.
The patient was subsequently found to have [**4-29**] blood cultures positive for Vanco resistent Enterococcus facecium and was started on linezolid.
Urine was negative for infection, chest x-ray showed likely failure and possible pneumonia.
Two days prior to admission, the patient was noted to have nausea and vomiting at the rehab facility.
CXR showed a patchy LLL opacity.

Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: At the time of discharge:  gen: NAD, responsive to simple commands, nods yes and no to questions with verbalization, tracheostomy in place skin: widespread miliaria on back, stage II sacral decub, not infected appearing with dressing in place, left heel decub right picc, left peripheral line, non infected appearing with no-erythema or discharge HEENT: MM dry, PERLLA, EOMI, no JVD, no carotid bruits, no lymphadenopathy, trach in place cranieotomy scar on scalp lungs: coarse breath sounds bilaterally with no wheeze heart: rr, s1 and s2wnl, +[**3-2**] holosystolic at apex->axilla abd: +b/s, soft, nd, nt, PEG intact-no tenderness, erythema extr: no LE extremity edema, trace bilateral UE edema, non-tender left heel ulcer and left knee excoriation pulses: brisk pulses throughout   Pertinent Results: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2125-11-29**] 1:14 AM FINDINGS:  Again are noted bilateral subdural collections left greater than right.
There is persistent mild mass effect, also unchanged.
Hypodensities are seen in the periventricular white matter consistent with small vessel ischemic disease.
In addition, there are hypodensities in the subcortical white matter consistent with lacunar infarcts.
There is no new acute intracranial hemorrhage or hydrocephalus.
ECHO Study Date of [**2125-11-29**] Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No definite vegetations seen.
However, the absence of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis if clinically suggested.
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT PORT  [**2125-12-1**] 2:30 PM IMPRESSION: No evidence of left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis.
Hypoxic Resp Failure c/b Trach: It was thought the patient's respiratory failure was most likely related to a LLL aspiration PNA (vs chemical pneumonitis).
The DDx also included PE but this was considered unlikely since the patient has an IVC filter (placed [**11-4**]).
His platelets will need to be closely monitored given his history of myelodysplasia.
Culture of the catheter tip revealed growth of Klebsiella pneumo suceptible to zosyn but resistant to levo.
At the time of discharge the patient had been afebrile for over 1 week.
The patient had one episode of a fib with spontaneous conversion to NSR after receiving diltiazem.
No Anti-coagulation given history of multiple intracranial bleeds.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Hypoxic Respiratory Failure Secondary: Aspiration Pneumonia Congestive Heart failure Klebsiella line infection VRE endocarditis Myelodysplasia anemia of chronic disease Atrial Fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Stable.
