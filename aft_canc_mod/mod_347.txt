Give the combined morphologic and immunohistochemical findings potential primary sites include but are not limited to breast, ovary and possibly uterus or upper GI tract.
Brief Hospital Course: 51F with h/o bilateral breast CA, thyroid CA, NHL, pulmonary fibrosis s/p XRT, asthma, hypothyrodism, chronic kidney disease stage [**Year (4 digits) 1105**], presented with worsening vomiting and reflux symptoms and found to have metastatic ovarian cancer.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Metastatic Ovarian Cancer resulting in Small Bowel Obstruction: Pt presented with refractory vomiting.
Given the symptoms the pt underwent an EGD with biopsies was performed, which showed severe erosive esophagitis and a duodenal stricture of unclear etiology.
Pathology from gastric and duodenal biopsies was negative for malignancy.
Given her CKD stage [**Name (NI) 1105**], pt received pre-contrast hydration protocol with sodium bicarbonate to minimize the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy.
Unfortunately, the CT scan showed significant evidence of malignancy, with "extensive soft-tissue mass involving the greater omentum.
In addition, new hepatic lesions, ascites, and colonic serosal lesion are worrisome for peritoneal metastases from breast or ovarian cancer."
Pathology showed infiltrating adenocarcinoma.
Special stains showed a primary tumor either from the breast, ovary, uterus or upper GI tract.
The Oncology team at [**Hospital1 18**] was consulted and they requested an MRI brain, which was negative and a transvaginal US which showed multiple cystic lesions in the left adnexa.
Oncology also recomended a Gyn/Onc c/s for possible surgical mangement.
The patient had ongoing difficulty tolerating po's and a repeat EGD was done which did not show a stentable lesion.
For further targeting of a lesion, a GI follow through was done which showed a partial high grade obstruction in the third portion of the duodenum.
In the setting of elevated CA 125, an pelvic u/s revealing a ovarian mass and a pathological finding of adenocarcinoma, a diagnosis of metastatic ovarian CA was made.
The patient had a G tube placed on [**2143-7-18**] that relieved her symptoms of obstruction.
# Aspiration pneumonia: became evident when she developed acute hypoxia, tachypnea, and cough on [**7-5**].
CXR showed new RML and RLL infiltrates, and she was started on levofloxacin.
Her WBC was persistently elevated and her coverage was changed to vanco/CTX and flagyl which she continued for 10 days.
She was noted to be rhonchorous and has had difficulty generating sufficient expiratory forces to help remove some of the secretions.
She has a history of Radiation-induced fibrosis, restrictive lung disease, and persistent R pleural effusions which all lend to a poor respiratory reserve.
# Atrial fibrillation: went into spontaneous afibrillation on the floor.
She was given Dilt (out of concern that beta blockade would worsen her respiratory status), ABG was performed but revealed a venous gas.
Given the fact that her tachycardia was refactory to IV dilt, after receiving additional 90 of PO Dilt she was transferred to the unit for further management.
The afib was attributed to recent aspiration event and was managed with metoprolol and diltiazem.
Her medications were continued in the ICU and as pt's respiratory status and overall clinical status improved, pt re-entered sinus rhythm and was no longer tachycardic.
# Pleural effusions Likley due to structural lung disease with overlying infection.
The left pleural effusion was tapped (drained 800cc initially) by the ICU team on [**7-9**] with some releif of her symptoms.
Her pleural fluid was negative for malignancy and was transudative according to Light's criteria and did not grow any microorganisms.
# Acute On Chronic kidney disease, stage 4: Etiology unclear.
# AF with RVR: The patient experienced AF with RVR while in the ICU which was treated with B-blockers and calcium channel blockers.
# Hypothyroidism: recent TSH at [**Hospital1 112**].
# HTN: stable, continued Metoprolol Succinate XL 25 mg PO DAILY  # depression: stable, continued sertraline 100 mg PO DAILY  # Symptomatic hypocalcemia: Evaluation led to diagnosis of probable hypoparathyroidism (CONFIRM)based on her prior thyroid surgery for thyroid cancer.
According to information from OSH, the patient has some residual parathryodi tissues???
Endocrinology was consulted while in the ICU for syptomatic hypocalcemia and she received IV and oral repletion with Vit D and CaCO3.
# Venous access: Obtaining a good venous access has been a substantial challenge given poor peripheral veins.
#Goals of Care/Code status: A goals of care meeting was conducted with the patient and a friend where it was shared with the patient that she had a guarded prognosis given her metastatic cancer.
