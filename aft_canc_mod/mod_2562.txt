[**2163-8-25**] Flexible Bronchoscopy   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 83-year-old gentleman who has had dyspnea and was found to have a proximal posterior tracheal tumor.
The pathology was consistent with an endocrine neoplasm, potentially related to his resected thyroid cancer from over 20 years ago.

PERRLA   Pertinent Results: [**2163-9-1**] WBC-3.8* RBC-3.04* Hgb-10.3* Hct-29.9* Plt Ct-313 [**2163-9-1**] Glucose-110* UreaN-11 Creat-1.1 Na-138 K-3.5 Cl-102 HCO3-26 [**2163-9-1**] Calcium-9.2 Phos-2.9 Mg-2.209/30/09 WBC-5.8# RBC-3.10* Hgb-10.0*  [**2163-8-18**] calTIBC-273 Ferritn-404* TRF-210  [**2163-8-28**] Video Swallow: FINDINGS: A swallowing video fluoroscopy study was done in conjunction with the speech pathology service.
Varying consistencies of oral barium were administered.
Moderate penetration and aspiration was noted with both thin and nectar thick liquids.
The patient did not respond well to cues for cough, and a delayed spontaneous cough was inadequate for clearing this aspiration.
No pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection or aneurysm.
Post-surgical changes in the upper trachea is noted with extensive subcutaneous soft tissue with small pockets of air.
Marked expiratory collapsibility of the tracheobronchial tree is consistent significant tracheobronchomalacia which is causing air trapping particularly throughout the right lung.
Coronary artery calcification is moderate in the left anterior descending and circumflex artery.
Sub 2-mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodules are unchanged to [**2163-4-25**]  CXR: [**2163-8-24**]  Since the previous study the subcutaneous edema in the neck has reduced, the lungs are fully expanded and clear with the exception of minor atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
No consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax, the left costophrenic angle has not been included on this study.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with degenerative change in the thoracic spine.
[**2163-8-21**] Focal tracheal narrowing at the thoracic inlet may be due to recent surgery.
Minimal linear foci of atelectasis are present at the left base with otherwise clear lungs.
[**2163-8-17**] There is no evidence of pneumothorax, minimal left basal atelectasis.
No evidence of other focal parenchymal opacities.
He had mild stridor immediately postoperative and Heliox was administered.
On [**2163-8-22**] he developed respiratory distress requiring nasal-oropharyngeal suction.
On [**2163-8-25**] he had Flexible Bronchoscopy which showed normal anastomosis with diffuse inflammation of the trachea.
He was followed by serial chest films which showed improved subcutaneous emphysema of the neck and lower lobe atelectasis.
ENT followed him closely with multiple scoping to assess vocal cords and anastomosis.
A video-swallow revealed loss of his recurrent laryngeal nerve during surgery.
Pharyngeal contraction was absent on the right-side,significantly reducing patient's ability to clear any bolus, and resulting in severe pharyngeal residue ultimating leading to aspiration.
ID: He remained afebrile throughout.
Failed Foley trial [**8-31**], re-inserted for 650 urinary retention.
Neuro: Geriatric was consulted and followed him for mild dementia.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Suppository Rectal DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2857**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Recurrent Thyroid Cancer Trachael Tumor Hypertension/Hyperlipidemia Early Dementia BPH Spinal Stenosis Gait Abnormality   Discharge Condition: deconditioned   Discharge Instructions: Call Dr.[**Name (NI) 2347**] office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2348**] if experience: -Fever > 101 or chills -Increased shortness of breath, cough or sputum production -PEG tube falls out or site becomes red, purulent or drainage.
