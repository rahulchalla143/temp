HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known firstname 26681**] [**Known lastname 17744**] is an 81-year-old female with a complicated past medical history who presented with several months of fevers as well as rash of approximately three weeks duration.
The patient's past medical history dates back to [**2172**], at which time she had a medical workup for abdominal pain, weight loss, and anorexia.
She had a CAT scan done on [**2173-1-5**] that showed significant abdominal adenopathy, extensive adenopathy displacing the bowel in the periaortic, aorta cava, and mesenteric area.
She had a bone marrow biopsy done on [**2173-1-13**] that showed no evidence of malignancy.
In [**2173-2-4**], the patient then had a retroperitoneal node biopsy done via a mini-laparotomy procedure which showed granulomatous lymphadenitis with noncaseating granulomas.
Also in [**2173-2-4**], the patient had the onset of low-grade temperatures as well as some early satiety, and she continued to have abdominal pain.
Approximately one year ago, in [**2175**], the patient was diagnosed with Crohn's disease.
It is my understanding that this was a clinical diagnosis, as there was no documented colonoscopy.
The medications used to treat her Crohn's disease included prednisone, 6-MP, methotrexate, as well as Remicade.
She also had approximately a 6-month course of high-dose steroids for the Crohn's disease with a taper prior to starting her first Remicade cycle.
She was thought at that time to have a Crohn's flare (plus or minus gastroenteritis).
It should be mentioned at this time that the patient had intermittent fevers occurring weekly and spiking up to 103 for approximately four to five months prior to her admission to the hospital in [**2177-4-4**].
At that time she looked tired and exhausted, although her Crohn's disease was quiescent.
On [**4-21**], the patient's fevers returned, and she was spiking to 103 at home, continued to have night sweats (which was essentially her baseline with these fevers).
She also has episodes where she becomes somewhat lethargic and nearly unresponsive during the hour or so before she is going to have a temperature spike.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   Review of systems was also positive for weight loss and lethargy (as mentioned) during the temperature spikes and drenching night sweats.
Otherwise, negative for headache and visual changes.
No sinus congestion.
No shortness of breath.
No nausea or vomiting.
No abdominal pain.
No joint pain.
No other localizing symptoms to correlate with these fevers.
Approximately three weeks prior to admission, the patient mentioned that she noted a nodule in her right axilla.
Over time, the patient developed significant/enumerable nodules and papules covering her sternum, her breasts, her abdomen, her upper extremities, her upper back, and the back of her neck, as well as her scalp.
When she was admitted to the hospital on [**4-21**], she was carrying the presumptive diagnosis of a cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorder, but that had not been further characterized when she was admitted to the hospital.
However, she came to the Emergency Department (brought by her husband) in the setting of having a temperature spike and her usual rigors, sweats, and lethargy.
She was noted to have what the husband felt was mild respiratory distress with deep inspiration, and what he characterized as respiratory difficulty.
Also significant for uterine suspension in [**2141**], as well as total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in [**2144**].
She also does carry the diagnosis of Crohn's disease and sarcoidosis (as mentioned).
FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history is significant for diabetes mellitus.
Mother died of stomach cancer and a pulmonary embolism, and a daughter who has survived breast cancer.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No history of tobacco.
No history of intravenous drug use.
[**Name (NI) **] family is very supportive of her and has been giving her tremendous support during the past year and a half when she has been suffering from these recurrent fevers and an ongoing workup for them.
There was no oropharyngeal erythema.
No oral lesions.
There was no lymphadenopathy.
No third heart sound.
No fourth heart sound.
Extremities were without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram with sinus tachycardia at 106, flat T waves in aVL and III.
CT scan showed bilateral atelectasis at the lung bases, small stone in the gallbladder, as well as perihepatic ascites, and a small amount of pelvic ascites.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   In summary, then, Ms. [**Known lastname 17744**] is an 81-year-old female with a history of sarcoid and Crohn's disease who has had recurrent temperature spikes times approximately six months as well as an approximate year and a half history of low-grade fevers prior to these temperature spikes.
She also presents with a progressive skin eruption consisting of papules and nodules over the past three weeks.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course while she was on the Medicine Service is as follows:  The patient had a consultation by Hematology/Oncology on the day following admission, at which time a bone marrow biopsy was done, and the slide from the outside facility was read of her cutaneous lesions.
She was found to have CD30 positive and CD68 positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma.
Subsequent studies of her bone marrow and her peripheral blood showed that she had large cell anaplastic lymphoma in the peripheral blood as well as in the bone marrow.
The patient also had a Gastrointestinal consultation for further evaluation of her question of Crohn's disease.
In terms of management of that, however, when the patient presented during this hospital admission, her Crohn's disease did not seem to be an active issue, as she was not complaining of any diarrhea or abdominal pain.
Following that through, from the [**4-25**] to the [**4-28**], she continued to have a rapid decline in her platelets; such that, on [**4-28**], her platelets were 18.
She had a lactate level drawn which was 15.5 (consistent with a metabolic acidosis).
The patient had a head CT done to further evaluation the lethargy and dramatic change in her mental status in her peri-febrile states.
Her head CT was negative for any bleed, any evidence of a regional infarction, or any mass lesions.
It was felt that the patient's DIC as well as metabolic acidosis was perhaps due to tumor burden versus tumor lysis.
The question of tumor lysis seemed less likely given that the patient started to decompensate prior to receiving the methotrexate.
They were unwilling to make the patient comfort measures only; and, similarly, they were unwilling to pursue a more aggressive chemotherapy regimen such as CHOP with methotrexate.
The patient was able to participate in all of these discussions regarding her code status and regarding her treatment of her large cell anaplastic lymphoma.
