Admission Date:  [**2172-3-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2172-4-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2118-6-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4616**] Chief Complaint: S/p Fall  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy Transesophageal Echo Thoracentesis  History of Present Illness: 53 yoM fell from standing and hit his head on a table.
When asked the symptoms that preceeded his fall he states that he may have had lightheadedness prior to the fall.
At this current time he has no CP, SOB, HA, fever, chills, urinary symptoms, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain or any other symptoms.
He then underwent a CT of his head which was concerning for a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
He underwent an MRI without contrast at [**Hospital 15405**] and was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER.
In the [**Hospital1 **] ER he underwent repeat CT and this read as negative, his MRI was read as possible gyrohyperdensities in the L parietal lobe which could be infectious versus malignant.
He had a CXR with a L pleural effusion and was given vanc/zosyn/azithro.

[**3-4**] Bronch: Suspicious for malignant cells.
Rare clusters of highly atypical epithelioid cells with high N:C ratios and prominent nucleoli.
[**3-4**] Pleural fluid: Rare cluster of atypical epithelioid cells in a background of lymphocytes, neutrophils, macrophages and mesothelial cells.
IMAGING:  [**2172-3-2**] EKG: Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response.
Right bundle-branch block.
Delayed R wave progression.
Findings raise the consideration of possible chronic pulmonary disease, right ventricular overload and possible prior anterior wall myocardial infarction.
[**2172-3-3**] EEG: This is an abnormal video EEG due to slowing and disorganization of the background rhythm with bursts of generalized suppression.
In sleep, note is made of intermittent generalized sharp waves with bifrontal predominance with a triphasic morphology of unclear significance.
No electrographic seizures were seen during this recording and this telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
[**2172-3-3**] MRI Brain w/ contrast: Focal enhancement and edema centered around the left postcentral gyrus is concerning for a mestastasis given the location and large pulmonary mass on the chest CT. Additional differential considerations would include infection or a primary brain tumor.
The appearance would be unusual for a vascular malformation, despite the prominent superficial vessel, and also unusual for an evolving infarct.
Locally invasive mass centered within the left hilum, extending to and abutting the left side of mediastinum, associated with secondary atelectasis of the left upper lobe and an organized left pleural effusion.
Borderline-sized mediastinal adenopathy.
Small airways disease.
CTA Chest w/ & w/o contrast: 1)Large infiltrating mass in the left hilum extending along the occluded left pulmonary vein into the left atrium and circumferentially encasing and infiltrating the left mainstem bronchus with compression of the lingular bronchus and subtotal compression of the left lower lobe bronchus causing atelectasis.
2)Mild mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
[**2172-3-2**] CXR: Left-sided pleural effusion with left basilar atelectasis.
No overt CHF.
Please note study is limited and if needed, a PA and lateral view can be performed to better assess  [**2172-3-3**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
A highly mobile small to medium sized mass (0.8 x 0.8 cm) is seen in the body of the left atrium which appears to possibly be attached to the base of the anterior mitral valve leaflet (differential diagnosis included thrombus, myxoma, vegetation, papillary fibroelastoma).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Low-normal left ventricular systolic function.
[**2172-3-4**] TEE: A mass is seen in the poterior wall of the left atrium near the site of the left upper pulmonary vein (not seen).
The left atrial mass has a broad base measuring 2.5 x 0.8 cm with a miobile, stalk-like aspect measuring 3 x 0.7 cm- ?
Thrombus versus extension of mass.
The left atiral appendage is seen and is free of mass or thrombus.
No mass or thrombus is seen in the right atrium or right atrial appendage.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Heterogenous mass with broad base (2.5 x 1.8 cm) and mobile stalk (3 x 0.7 cm) seen in the left posterior atrial wall adjacent to entrance of the left lower pulmonary vein and possibly occluding the entrance of the left upper pulmonary vein (not seen).
No valvular vegetations seen.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Small pericardial effusion seen.
Bilateral pelural effusions seen.
Bilateral enhancing low-density renal lesions which are highly concerning for metastases.
Focal renal abscesses could also have this appearance, and clinical correlation is recommended for signs of infection.
Bilateral renal cell carcinoma and lymphoma are considered less likely.
Moderate left pleural effusion and persistent left lower lobe consolidation.
No abnormal pleural enhancement.
Trace perihepatic ascites, and mild soft tissue edema and retroperitoneal stranding, consistent with mild volume overload.
The left parietal abnormality appears to demonstrate slight further mass effect on the adjacent sulci and slightly increased edema.
A repeat diffusion images will also help for further assessment and differentiating mass lesion versus infarct in this location.
Brief Hospital Course: 53 yoM w/ a h/o schizoaffective disorder presents s/p fall with atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response, intracranial lesion, and lung mass who has new dx of squamous cell lung cancer with extension into left atrium.
Squamous cell carcinoma of lung: New diagnosis found on imaging and subsequent lung biopsy after bronchoscopy.
Given left upper lobe collapse, a left bronchial stent was placed as well.
His lung mass extended into his left atrium.
This left atrial mass likely had broken fragments that embolized to the brain and bilateral kidneys.
Atrial & Ventricular Ectopy:  He developed atrial flutter in the MICU.
He had no further episodes of tachycardia  in the final week of his hospitalization.
This ectopy was largely secondary to his atrial mass.
He had one episode of desaturation to 80s on [**3-15**] and CXR showed new collapse of LUL near recent stent placement.
He was monitored closely and given aggressive chest PT, although his lung remained collapsed, he had no further episodes of desaturation.
He will follow up with IP in the outpatient for a flex bronchoscopy.
He had no further fever or signs of infection.
# Weakness over right UE/LE: Suspect this is due to L parietal lesion.
No mass effect from brain mass noted on repeat MRIs.
MS Change: Patient with known schizoaffective disorder to complicate what his baseline may be.
EEG was performed twice ([**3-3**] and [**3-4**]) and both showed findings consistent with mild to moderate encephalopathy that was improving.
He continued to complain of poor sleep at night.
Testicular mass: Has nodularity in right scrotum noted in the MICU which was not consistent with any metastatic mass by ultrasound.
His celexa was decreased to 20 mg daily (from 40 mg) as patient developed SIADH of unclear etiology.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 3894**] Nursing & Rehabilitation Center - [**Location (un) 5503**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Lung Right upper extremity DVT Mass in Brain  Secondary Diagnosis: Schizophrenia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because you fell and were found to have a mass in your head.
A CT scan of your chest showed a large mass in your chest as well.
This was biopsied and found to be squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.
This caused you to develop a fast heart rhythm.
You also developed blood clots in your right arm in the setting of a PICC line.
