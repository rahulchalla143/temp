History of Present Illness: 58 M h/o NSCLC stage III s/p chemo, RUL lobectomy and no residual thoracic/abd/pelvic disease on CT with brain mets s/p cyberknife x 3, CAD, COPD fev1 of 69% p/w cough and shortness of breath.
Started having URI symptoms with mild cough, congestion.
Since last night he felt very short of breath and was unable to get a ride to the ED until today, worsening shrotness of breath over this period of time and worsening cough prodcutive of yellow/white sputum.
Does have pain in his lower chest/upper abdomen with coughing, no vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, constipation or other complaints.
He had a CTA since he had tachycardia, hypoxia which showed no PE but LLL not visualized well due to motion artifact, and mult ground glass opacities suggestive of multifocal pneumonia.
He was given vancomycin and cefepime in addition to the levofloxacin dose, 1L of fluid, and albuterol x 3, atrovent x 3, and started bipap which helped with decreased work of breathing.
Denies any complaints currently.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: CAD with h/o remote MI per results of recent echocardiogram and s/p cardiac cath on [**2171-2-4**] with totally occluded RCA and slow flow through LAD Hypertension.
COPD, FEV1 69% 1/10 CVA on Avastin [**7-/2172**] seizure disorder secondary to metastatic brain lesions .
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - presented to [**Hospital1 2177**] [**3-/2170**] with shortness of breath, CT showed RUL lung mass, bronchoscopy was done but pt was lost to f/u until [**10-19**] - [**10-19**] presented to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 58318**] at [**Hospital1 18**], CT [**2170-10-31**] showed 2.7cm x 2.7 cm spiculated irregular nodule in the posterior RUL with associated 1.3 cm precarinal lymph node - [**2170-12-14**]: bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy with sampling of 4L, 4R, level 7 lymph nodes.
Lymph node biopsies negative - [**2170-12-21**]: CT-guided lung biopsy showed carcinoma with clear cell features consistent with renal origin.
No renal lesion was seen.
- [**2170-12-22**]: PET again revealing the 2.7 x 2.7 cm right upper lobe mass, which was markedly FDG avid (SUV 12.7).
- [**2170-12-26**] MRI Brain: no evidence of metastatic disease.
- [**2171-2-4**]: repeat bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound was done due to the markedly FDG-avid precarinal lymph node seen on PET scan.
The 4R lymph node station was again sampled, which revealed the presence of malignant cells, consistent with adenocarcinoma.
- [**2171-3-4**] XRT with concurrent cisplatin and etoposide for 2 cycles - [**2171-4-17**]: repeat bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy to assess for residual lymph node disease revealed malignant cells in the 4R lymph node, making him not a surgical candidate - continued XRT only, completed [**2171-5-1**] - [**2171-6-18**]:  resumed chemotherapy with cisplatin-pemetrexed at doses of cisplatin 75 mg/m2 day 1 and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 day 1, given on [**2171-6-18**] and [**2171-7-9**].
- [**2171-7-25**]: CT Chest showed reduction in size of RUL mass [**7-/2171**]/[**2172**]: Stable disease on imaging without treatment.
- [**2172-6-24**]: PET scan showed new right hilar mass and increased avidity of RUL nodule.
Brain MRI negative for metastatic disease.
Course complicated by CVA on [**2172-7-18**] which subsequently resolved.
- RUL lobectomy on [**2172-11-6**] and RML lobectomy for atelectatic lung on [**2172-11-22**] - [**Date range (3) 76763**]- presentes with new onset seizures with discovery of new brain metastases, started on decadron and keppra - [**Date range (2) 76764**]: 3 single fraction treatments with Cyberknife for brain metastases from NSC lung cancer  Social History: Immigrated from Poland 8 years ago.
Family History: No FHx of lung cancer, relative with throat cancer.

Evaluation for pulmonary embolism is limited secondary to patient motion.
No definite pulmonary embolism to the segmental levels bilaterally.
Diffuse ground-glass ground-glass opacities throughout the right lung and minimally within the left upper lobe and lingula raise concern for a multifocal infectious process.
No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
The degree of pleural thickening and/or loculated pleural effusion at the right apex is decreased.
