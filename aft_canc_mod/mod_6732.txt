History was mainly obtained via family and Hepatology team who stated that patient was in USOH however yesterday developed hematemesis with subsequent tarry stools.
Patient's family notified hepatology providers who arranged for patient to have EGD done today, which revealed a clot in the fundus of the stomach (in the area of the prior varix).
Of note patient was noted to have gastroesophageal varices in [**2-/2119**] un subsequently underwent banding of the esophageal varices in 03/[**2118**].
In the MICU, patient was resting comfortably however was complaining of abdominal discomfort.

Imaging: RUQ ULTRASOUND ([**2119-7-11**]): FINDINGS: The hepatic architecture is coarsened in appearance and an ill-defined mass is seen in the right hepatic lobe measuring approximately 6.3 x 5.5 x 5.5 cm and corresponding to known HCC.
No biliary dilatation is seen and the common duct measures 0.5 cm.
A small amount of ascites is seen in the abdomen.
Hepatopetal flow is seen in the main and left portal veins.
Coarsened hepatic architecture with redemonstration of right hepatic lobe HCC.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric LVH with a small LV cavity and hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
No filling defects within the main or lobar pulmonary arteries.
Mild to moderate right pleural effusion.
Known cirrhotic liver with incompletely imaged right lobe hypodense lesion and an ill-defined hyperdense area in the right lobe which is likely perfusion abnormality.
Hyperdense material in the gastric wall is consistent with the history of glue embolization.
[**7-11**] EGD: Impression:	Varices at the middle third of the esophagus Varices at the fundus Blood in the second part of the duodenum (injection) Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum .

# GI bleed: Patient had clot in area of prior gastric varix which likely bled causing hematemesis and melena.
There was no evidence of on-going bleeding however patient had 10 point hematocrit drop, requiring 1 unit of blood while in MICU.
Repeat EGD revealed passage of clot and hole in varix which was injected with glue.
# Glue Emboli: After procedure, CXR and KUB were obtained for abdominal distention.
These films did not reveal any free air however did show evidence of glue emboli from the EGD.
CTA was completed showing embolization to all segmental regions of pulmonary artery.
Echo was also completed which did not show any right heart strain or elevated PASP.
On the floor pt was sating well, temperatures came down and was afebrile for 24 hrs prior to discharge.
# Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 15.
# Hepatocellular Carcinoma: on Sorafenib.
# Hypertension: was normotensive in MICU and on the floor.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to our hospital after an episode of gastrointestinal bleeding.
We have found that some of the blood vessels in your stomach and esophagus were bleeding and we repaired them with a special glue.
STOP Lisinopril 5 mg by mouth daily, and do not take it until you have a conversation with your primary care doctor.
