Congestive heart failure - diastolic dysfunction.
Acute renal failure on chronic renal insufficiency.
Pulmonary hypertension.
ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  The patient is a 73 year-old woman who was in her usual state of health until about [**2176-12-11**] when she started noticing increasing swelling in her extremities and also some edema in her face and some dyspnea.
She was initially treated with diuretics and subsequently underwent a cardiac evaluation, which was notable for elevated pulmonary artery pressures and possible right heart failure.
Further workup of this noted elevated pulmonary artery pressures and imaging showed that she had a right upper lobe lung mass.
As per the patient she had a negative bronchoscopy and a mediastinoscopy in the past, but fine needle aspiration of this mass was positive for malignancy.
Given the nature of her lesion it was determined that the patient would benefit from right upper lobectomy.
There was no lymphadenopathy in the neck nor was there a bruit.
Abdomen was soft, nontender without any ascites.
As per prior note she had minimal pitting edema in the lower extremities.
She was taken to the Operating Room on [**2177-7-1**] where she underwent an exploratory thoracotomy with multiple lymph node biopsies and biopsy of right diaphragmatic plaque.
Intraoperatively it was found that the patient had extensive nodal involvement and it was determined that a lobectomy should not be undertaken and the patient was taken to the post anesthesia care unit.
In the post anesthesia care unit she developed some respiratory difficulties and required reintubation and also required vaso active pressors and fluids to improve her low blood pressure and heart rate.
Nitroglycerin was used for elevated pulmonary artery pressures.
On postoperative day one the patient remained intubated and was noted to have a significant rise in creatinine at 2.7.
Nephrology was consulted and determined that this was acute renal failure superimposed upon a history of chronic renal problem and advised gentle diuresis and avoidance of agents that induce renal vaso constriction.
Neurology was also consulted for mental status changes.
The patient had undergone an examination and was nonfocal and had no further recommendations or indications of acute neurological pathology appearing at that time.
During her period on Far 2 she experienced some confusion as a result of her narcotics, which were subsequently stopped, but otherwise her course was unremarkable.
She continued aggressive incentive spirometry and pulmonary toilet with ambulation and her respiratory examination improved and she was able to maintain good O2 sats on room air.
She was advised to seek immediate medical attention if she experiences onset of shortness of breath or chest pain.
