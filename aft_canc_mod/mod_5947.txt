Pt went for routine echo with cardiologist and found to have a new pericardial effusion and was referred and admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) **].
Pt did not have any signs of temponade and did not have any complaints and was discharged home without pericardiocentesis.
He states that he has been experienceing mild dyspnea on exertion and fatigue since the PE and has felt moderate fatigue.
On follow up appointment pt noted to have increasing size of effusion and pt scheduled for tap.
He states that he hasn't had any chest pain or increase in his baseline dyspnea since the last admission.
Past Medical History: -CAD -R-CEA -DM II -Prostate cancer -Gout -Hypercholesterolemia -CVA -HTN  Social History: -Pt lives with wife and son -Positive [**Name2 (NI) **] hx: smoked cigars and pipes 6pipes/day x 20 years, quit 20 years ago -No ETOH, cocaine or other drug use .
Family History: F: Died of "enlarged heart" M: Died of ?CVA in 80s Brother: died of MI at 51, another brother with MI in 70s .
Physical Exam: T: 98.8  BP: 140/73    HR:66  RR 20 O2sat 95%RA PE: GEN:  Pt is a elderly male s/p tap earlier now in no appearent acute distress HEENT:  MMM, PERRL, JVP not assessed as pt lying flat post cath.
Pericardial tap site - dressing intact, no drainage.
CVR:  RRR, nl S1, S2,  No r/m/g appreciated Abdomen:  Soft, Nontender and nondistended with normal bowel sounds Ext:  no edema.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Right heart catheterization revealed slightly elevated left and right heart filling pressures.
There was no evidence of tamponade physiology.
Difficult tapping of a loculated pericardial effusion.
The mean pericardial pressure was 5mm HG, decreasing to 2mm Hg with drainage of 360ml of bloody fluid.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion  abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is a  small to moderate sized loculated echo dense pericardial effusion extending  anteriorly in the interventricular groove from the mid wall to the apex c/w a hematoma.
There is no evidence of right ventricular diastolic collapse.
The loculated echo dense pericardial effusion was also present on  review of the prior study.
is a  84 yom with DM, CAD with pericardial effusion on anticogualation for recent PE.
[] Pericardial effusion - Drain in place will continue to monitor overnight.
DDx for pleural effusion is wide however given the cell count with numerous RBC, this is likely hemorrhagic pericardial effusion.
Likely etiology include Malignancy ??????
18%, Postpericardiotomy syndrome ??????
13%, Complications of myocardial infarction (free wall rupture, thrombolysis) ??????
11%, Idiopathic ??????
7%, Aortic dissection ??????
4%, Trauma ??????
In conjunction with the history the three most likely are to be melignancy, idiopathic or likely due to anticogulation.
- Pt was treated with warfarin for PE recently and this can certainly have atributed to the effusion.
[] Cardiac Ischemia - history of CAD per records however no records of cath here.
No episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath and monitored on tele.
Rhythm - SR with RBBB .
[] Pulmonary - History of PE - Given recent PE early [**Month (only) **] concerning for repeat event, however given hemorrhagic effusion and IVC filter which was placed today at cath, held anticogulation with coumadin immediately post procedure.
[] HTN - Continue outpt meds, adjust accordingly.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Pericardial effusion coronary artery disease insulin dependent diabetes mellitus   Discharge Condition: Good- patient afebrile and hemodynamically stable, minimal pain.
