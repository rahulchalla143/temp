REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Evaluate lesions INDICATIONS: Enhancing lesions on outside MRI.
Left upper lobe mass, liver mass and lytic lesions of the spine.
FINDINGS: There are innumerable areas of susceptibility effect in the cerebellum and cerebrum, many associated with T1 hyperintensity.
There is a lesion in the dorsal left mid brain on the lateral claviculi.
There are 2.3 cm lesions in the lateral left frontal lobe, the medial right parietal lobe and the right lentiform nucleus.
There is vasogenic edema, particularly prominent in the parietal white matter, the right posterior temporal region and the right cerebellar hemisphere.
There is minimal right sided mass effect in the fourth ventricle.
There is no hydrocephalus.
IMPRESSION: There are innumerable lesions in the brain parenchyma with associated blood break down products and enhancement most consistent with multiple metastases.
There is some shift of the septum pellucidum towards the left but no dilatation of the ventricular system.
There is a large right cerebellar lesion with some edema but only minimal mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
An unusual peripherally enhancing pineal mass is noted, probably also a metastases.
DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Approved: TUE [**2103-8-21**] 9:44 PM --- CT ABD W&W/O C  [**2103-8-11**] 5:08 PM  CT ABD W&W/O C; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  Reason: Possibility for tissue sample, either via bronchoscopy or li Field of view: 30 Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 39 year old woman with multiple cerebral lesions, l lung lesion, and large liver mass.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Possibility for tissue sample, either via bronchoscopy or liver biopsy.
INDICATION: Multiple cerebral lesions, left lung lesion, large liver mass.
CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Within the apex of the left upper lobe, there is an ill defined mass present, measuring 2.4 x 3.2 cm.
Contiguous with this mass and just inferior to it are several, smaller, ill defined nodules within the left upper lobe and left hilar region, the largest of which measures 1.5 x 1.2 cm.
There is narrowing of the left upper lobe bronchus by the left hilar mass.
An enlarged prevascular lymph node is identified adjacent to the aorta measuring approximately 11 mm.
An ill defined left hilar mass is identified which appears to consist of a conglomeration of smaller pulmonary parenchymal nodules and left hilar lymph nodes, which narrows the left upper lobe bronchus.
No other pathologically enlarged axillary lymphadenopathy is seen.
No pleural or pericardial effusion is present.
CT ABDOMEN W/O&W IV CONTRAST: Within the left lateral segment of the liver, there is a large, heterogeneously enhancing mass present which measures approximately 4.0 x 7.7 cm.
Within the dome of the right lobe of the liver, there is a second, enhancing, low attenuation lesion present measuring 2.1 x 1.3 cm.
Multiple, smaller, heterogeneously enhancing, low attenuation lesions appear to be present throughout the liver, findings suggestive of innumerable metastatic lesions.
There is no intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.
There is no free air or free fluid.
There is no significant mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
There is no free fluid.
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
No definite extension into the spinal canal is present.
IMPRESSION: Large ill defined mass within the left upper lobe of the lung concerning for a primary neoplastic process.
Heterogeneously enhancing low attenuation lesions within the liver as well as lytic lesions within the bones are concerning for hepatic and osseous metastases.
The large mass within the left lateral segment of the liver would be amenable to ultrasound guided biopsy.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 39 year old woman with nsclc mets to brain, s/p VP shunt 2 days ago now with fairly severe HA for several hours.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Any hydrocephalus or indication of shunt malfunction?
INDICATION: Severe headache for several hours, status-post VP shunt two days ago, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer to brain.
FINDINGS: There is again demonstrated a small amount of residual intraventricular hemorrhage in the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle.
There has been interval removal of the right-sided intraventricular drain with a small amount of hemorrhagic products along the course of the prior drain.
There are again demonstrated innumerable metastatic brain lesions.
There is no shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
A small amount of hemorrhage products are noted along the course of the prior drainage catheter.
Brief Hospital Course: 39F recent onset of paresthesias, low back pain, headache accompanied by nausea and vomiting, and confusion, transferred from outside hospital, with multiple intracranial, pulmonary, bony, and hepatic masses.
1) Altered mental status associated with multiple intracranial masses: Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**8-10**].
Diagnosis of metastatic large cell lung cancer was made by ultrasound guided liver biopsy, and multiple metases noted throughout spine and brain by MRI (L spine metases, loss of L4 disc space, foraminal narrowing; multiple enhancing lesions in brain, largest of 2.5 cm with hemorrhage).
Carboplatin/Taxol chemotherapy was administered, however, over several days, patient began to have decreased level of consciousness, increased headache, nausea, and vomiting with no relief from narcotics or acetaminophen.
On day 4 following chemotherapy, patient became unresponsive to verbal stimuli and somnolent with decreased tone; this was thought to be possibly a non-convulsive status event.
CT head at the time indicated new metastases, effacement of sulci and herniation into the foramen magnum.
A right frontal EVD was placed, and mannitol and decadron were administered to reduce edema and increased intracranial pressure.
The patient's mental status continued to improve and at the time of discharge, decadron had been weaned to 4mg QD.
2) Metastatic lung cancer: Although it was felt that the patient had an overall poor prognosis, it was felt that she may still benefit from a palliative standpoint from aggressive treatment.
Was scheduled for repeated chemotherapy but delayed due to EVD infection.
The patient was started on Iressa (EGFR inhibitor) 250mg qd, since shown to have some benefit in metastatic lung Ca to brain as 2nd line [**Doctor Last Name 360**] to chemo/XRT.
3) Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia: Had multiple runs of NSVT and was started on amiodarone infusion.
Evaluated by Cardiology who felt that the rhythm was polymorphic, and likely catecholamine mediated VT which would be best treated with a beta-blocker.
Felt to be NOT a candidate for ICD given her metastatic disease.
Also felt to have some component of Brugada syndrome (but does not strictly meet criteria for this).
5) Pain control: Patient was continuing to have headaches despite recovery of her mental status.
Repeat head CT showed residual blood in the ventricles, likely from removal of the EVD.
It was felt that her headaches were likely due to this residual blood, and that the VP shunt was still patent and functioning.
Patient's pain was fairly well controlled with morphine PCA, then converted to Oxycontin with oxycodone for breakthrough pain.
Some headache is to be expected, and you should take your pain medication.
However, if it associated with mental status changes or weakness, you should call your doctor immediately ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1669**]).
