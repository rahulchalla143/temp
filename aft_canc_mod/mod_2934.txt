Admission Date:  [**2116-6-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2116-7-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2076-9-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Iodine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: Here for allogeneic transplant for refractory multiple myeloma  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: central line placement and removal chemotherapy with cytoxan and busulfan allogeneic bome marrow transplant PICC line placement VATS/pleurodeisis  History of Present Illness: 39 yo male with multiple myeloma diagnosed in [**2114**] He was initially treated with Decadron alone and then began treatment with thalidomide and dexamethasone, which was started in 09/[**2114**].
He was noted for a very good response to his treatment with a repeat bone marrow biopsy in [**2115-3-19**] showing 5% plasma cells as well as marked improvement in his lesion in the sacral area.
In [**Month (only) 547**]/05, he was noted to have a drop in his white blood count, and repeat bone marrow biopsy showed increasing plasma cells with 20% involvement.
Following this therapy, he had increasing pain with increasing IgG levels and SPEP with a poor response to therapy, he was switched to treatment with Velcade and Decadron.
Followup evaluation of his disease at 2 months post-transplant at the end of [**10/2115**] showed approximately 10% involvement by plasma cells by CD138 staining.
On [**2116-1-19**], pt has increasing pain in the left groin area.
An x-ray of the area did not show any evidence for fracture or lesion.
He did undergo an MRI as well, which showed a lesion near the groin area with no pathologic fracture.
Also in this setting, his IgG level had now increased to almost 4 g.  He underwent a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy by his local oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 59071**], which revealed extensive relapsed disease with plasma cell myeloma accounting for 80-90% of the core biopsy specimen.
Multiple myeloma as described above.
History of DVT and PE while receiving thalidomide, status post 6 months of anticoagulation.
Recent pneumonia treated with a 14-day course of Levofloxacin in 02/[**2116**].
Family History: Mr. [**Known lastname 40270**] has no hematologic malignancies in his family.
There is type 2 diabetes in the family with elevated cholesterol.
His mother died of a cerebrovascular accident.
Neuro: A&Ox 3 Back: no point tenderness to palpation  Pertinent Results: .
[**6-2**] CXR: Slight improvement in the multiple patchy opacities which may be consistent with improving multifocal pneumonia .
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**6-2**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia.
[**6-8**] CXR: Stable appearance of multiple airspace opacities within the bilateral lungs which may represent multifocal pneumonia .
[**6-8**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia.
Diffuse ST-T changes are nonspecific .
[**6-8**] Transfusion reaction investigation: Mr [**Known lastname 40270**] had diffuse trunk and arm pain, tachycardia, mild hypertension and difficulty breathing while undergoing a transfusion of compatible red cells.
Although there are a few laboratory parameters that are suspicious for hemolysis (mildy elevated LDH), other labs (negative DAT, normal haptoglobin) are not supportive of hemolysis, nor is his clinical picture.
We feel that this reaction is an atypical non-hemolytic transfusion reaction that does not have a clear underlying cause.
[**6-9**] ECG: Sinus rhythm.
Non-specific diffuse T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2116-6-2**] no significant diagnostic change.
[**6-11**] US Liver: No evidence of liver, gallbladder, or biliary tree pathology to explain the patient's symptoms.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is persistent left lower lobe opacity presumably atelectasis which appears slightly increased with the medial diaphragm obscured.
No new areas of consolidation or effusion are identified.
Interval development of large left and smaller right pleural effusions.
A new focal area of consolidation is seen at the left lung base which may represent atelectasis or possible pneumonia.
Resolving multifocal areas of peribronchovascular nodular opacification.
Progressive areas of soft tissue density in the paraspinal, pleural/extrapleural bases and left pelvis.
Multifocal skeletal lesions are relatively unchanged and most severe at T11 with associated wedge compression fracture and in the left scapula.
No radiographic findings to explain the patient's abdominal pain.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-6-2**], there is no significant change.
[**2116-6-18**] Transthoracic Echocardiogram: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade, although there is brief right atrial diastolic invagination.
[**2116-6-17**] CXR:IMPRESSION: Markedly increased right pleural effusion, compared to the prior study, worrisome for hemothorax in this patient with recent thoracentesis if it was on the right side.
Edema in the right lung.
Large pleural fluid accumulation in the right hemithorax, with findings suggestive of clot in the inferior aspect.
Stable appearance of left pleural effusion.
No pulmonary embolism.
Otherwise, no significant interval change since examination of [**2116-6-13**]  [**2116-6-19**]: CHEST AP: IMPRESSION: Stable pulmonary edema.
Tiny right apical pneumothorax.
Worsening left lower lobe consolidation, which could represent atelectasis or pneumonia.
[**2116-6-22**]: CXR - Interstitial edema has cleared though pulmonary vascular redistribution persists.
Left lower lobe has been consolidated since at least [**6-18**] and could be either persistent atelectatic or infected.
Right pleural tube still in place, but there is no pneumothorax or appreciable right pleural effusion.
[**2116-6-28**] Right Upper extremity ultrasound: IMPRESSION: No evidence of left upper extremity DVT.
The right apical pneumothorax is no longer visualized.
There is a persistent left retrocardiac opacity and bilateral pleural effusion, which are stable.
There is no overt pulmonary edema.
The lungs are clear, and there are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
5.There is a small pericardial effusion with fibrin deposits on the surface of the heart.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-6-18**], there is no significant change.
[**7-2**] EEG: IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing.
These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathic condition affecting both cortical and  subcortical structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and  infection are among the most common causes.
There were no areas of persistent focal slowing, and there were no epileptiform features.
In the future he should receive S negative red cells for transfusion.
[**7-15**] RUQ U/S IMPRESSION: No son[**Name (NI) 493**] abnormalities in the right upper quadrant.
C5-6 disc protrusion to the right with indentation on the spinal cord and occlusion of the neural foramen.
No evidence of epidural abscess.
Persistent small right pneumothorax, as seen on an earlier radiograph of the same day.
Improvement in bilateral pleural effusions, with small residual left effusion.
Similar prominent soft tissue densities in the left pelvic side wall, probably lymphadenopathy.
He had one suspected transfusion reaction to pRBCs, and an investigation was performed.
After the allogeneic BMT, he had febrile neutropenia.
He had a chest x-ray and CT scan that demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
He was diuresed with some decrease in effusion size, although left sided effusion was still large.
On [**6-18**], given the persistent, high fevers, and consolidation within the left pleural effusion, there was a concern for empyema.
Approximately 10 hours after the procedure, patient noted severe substernal chest pain, difficulty breathing.
He was tachycardic to 130's.
Pain responded to iv morphine.
A chest x-ray was performed and demonstrated new right pleural effusion.
His hematocrit had decreased to 15 (approx 8 point decrease) and concern for hemothorax.
He continued to have serosanguinous drainage from chest tube site while he was neutropenic, but this stopped when his blood counts started rising.
On [**7-1**], patient was noted to be diaphoretic and complained of not feeling well.
An ABG on the BMT floor showed hypercarbia (ABG: 7.27/58/89/28) with stable vital signs and a PE notable for poor respiratory excursion.
Pt was given 0.8mg Narcan-- > became more alert for a couple of minutes and then again lapsed obtunded state, had tonic clonic sz activity, and was noted to have LOC, disconjugated gaze and bowel incontinence.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient was noted to be in hypercarbic resp failure as above.
His seizure/MS changes as above were thought due to his hypercarbia and no AEDs were initiated as per the neurology c/s service.
It was thought that this was likely iatrogenic in nature rather than prerenal azotemia as he was fluid overloaded on exam, with nml vital signs and urine lytes c/w ATN.
He was steadily weaned from the vent until [**7-8**] am when he was noted to have a sudden increase in oxygen requirement.
He was bronched ([**7-8**]) and was noted to have progressive bloody return on BAL, concerning for recurrent diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
From [**2116-7-22**] to [**2116-7-25**], Mr. [**Known lastname 59072**] mental status deteriorated such that he was no longer awake and responsive.
On the night of [**7-25**], in light of increasing oxygen requirements/decreasing sats and upon consultation with the BMT team and his wife, the decision was made to withdraw life support due to dismal prognosis and his wife's feeling that he had fought and suffered long enough.
Fever & neutropenia: While in the ICU, the patient was continued on Vancomycin and  Meropenem given his prior MRSA bacteremia and neutropenic fever.
Two thansthoracic echocardiograms were performed looking for valvular vegetations but none seen.
Back pain: Mr [**Known lastname 40270**] has chronic back pain secondary to his myeloma.
He was continued on MSSR, with a dose increase to 60 [**Hospital1 **], and covered for breakthrough pain with prn MSIR.
TPN was started on [**2116-6-27**] given poor po intake, low albumin.
FULL CODE  *** Of note, he has a bactrim allergy, so he will need to have pentamidine as PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
aerosolized pentamidine q. monthly last given on [**2116-5-28**]  Discharge Disposition: Home with Service  Discharge Diagnosis: Multiple Myeloma MRSA bacteremia bilateral pleural effusions Hemothorax   Discharge Condition: Death  Discharge Instructions: None  Followup Instructions: None
