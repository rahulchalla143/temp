Admission Date:  [**2165-5-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2165-5-19**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**] Chief Complaint: Upperg gastrointestinal bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Right Femoral CVL placement with attempted trauma line replacement Left IJ Trauma CVL placement  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **]F with history of cryptogenic cirrhosis c/b distal esophageal varices, duodenal ulcers and submucosal gastric neoplasm arrives from NH with massive hempotysis, and blood pressures 70s/30s.
A L femoal Cordis was placed.
EGD on [**5-2**] showed 3 cord grade I esophageal varices, 2 cm submucosal mass in stomach, and superficial non-bleeding ulcers at the duodenum.
Actively vomiting BRB with massive transfusion protocol activated.
Past Medical History: -Cryptogenic cirrhosis -Gastric tumor: Per [**Month/Day (4) 2287**] records, [**2160**] EGD notable for 1.5cm submucosal lesion in the proximal stomach c/w GIST tumor with associated ulceration/bleeding.
EGD on [**2165-5-2**] confirmed presence of fundic mass.
- Myelodysplastic syndrome - Hyponatremia - s/p Cataract surgery - Radial/ulnar fracture s/p surgical repair [**2165-4-25**]   Social History: Born in [**State 4565**].
No peripheral edema.
2+ peripheral pulses.
CXR initally showed right sided effussion with possible opacity concerning for traumatic hemothorax vs simple effusion vs aspiration.
Progressed to bilateral opacities and large right pleural effusion, c/w ARDS/cardiogenic pulmonary edema/aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia.
Initated treatment for HCAP given fever spikes in presence of CXR findings.
Her oxygenation progressively worsened, and she began having signs of respiratory distress.
She was started on IV morphine to relieve symptoms of respiratory distress.
She became progressively hypoxic and passed away peacefully soon after.
Concern for a parapneumonic effusion was low, as patient continued to improve without fevers on HCAP treatment.
Initially held off on thoracentesis given high risk in intubated supine patient.
However, with the goal of extubation in mind, the patient had a successful thoracentesis.
Unfortunately, the effusion recurred soon after, likely from severe total-body fluid overload.
Upper GI bleed from GIST tumor:  Presented with massive UGIB from GIST tumor.
Inability to achieve hemostasis during EGD lead to interventional raidoloyg performing a splenic artery embolization to stop the bleeding with good effect.
Had sporadic small drops in HCT requiring occsassional transfusions, as well as episodes of bloody ouput from NGT.
Eventually, the bleeding slowed, but the patient continued to have respiratory failure described above and eventually passed away from difficulty breathing.
[**Last Name (un) **]: Likely pre-renal/hypvolemia induced in presence of massive GIB and later diuresis in presence of massive fluid overload post resuscitative efforts  Her creatinine stabilized around 1.5 to 1.7 but never returned to her baseline.
