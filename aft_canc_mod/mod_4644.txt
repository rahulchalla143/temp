EEG also showed no seizure activity, and she is being maintained on Keppra currently.

Hemorrhage in the quadrigeminal cistern with subtle hemorrhage in the sulci of occipital lobe.
There are hypodensities in both occipital lobes in the white matter which could be suspicious for posterior reversible encephalopathy in view of patient's clinical history of hypertension.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates no evidence of aneurysm.
Subtle increased meningeal vascular structures in both occipital lobes could be secondary to hyperemia from posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.
No evidence of venous sinus thrombosis.
No acute fracture of the cervical spine.
Irregular nodule possibly cavitary in the right apex for which a chest CT is recommended.
Consider MR for further evaluation.
No large herniation.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage is again noted in the quadrigeminal plate cistern, along the superior vermis, and in the occipital sulci.
Evidence of chronic blood products in the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles.
Signal abnormalities in the subcortical white matter of the occipital, parietal, and frontal lobes, as well as in the right corona radiata, compatible with the posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.
No evidence of acute infarction.
However, subtle vasogenic edema related to small metastases is difficult to exclude in the absence of intravenous contrast.
No acute intracranial process.
Previously identified subarachnoid blood in the ambient cistern is no longer seen, compatible with expected evolution of blood products.
Development of diffuse fluid opacification of the bilateral mastoid air cells.
No evidence of intracranial metastases.
No acute hemorrhage or other acute abnormality.
Persistent opacification of bilateral mastoid air cells, which can be seen in mastoiditis.
No intracranial hemorrhage or acute intracranial abnormality.
Brief Hospital Course: NICU course: Once admitted, the patient was seen by EP for sinus bradycardia to the 20s and long QTc on ECG.
These were thought to be centrally mediated, and she did not have any bradycardia for several days.
Her renal function was elevated since admission, with Cr in the 1.8-1.9 range, but she has been maintaining good urine output and this has trended down to 1.5.
Her FeNa was 0.7% on [**8-4**], suggesting a pre-renal etiology, so she has received significant IV fluids.
She developed a progressively worsening metabolic non-AG acidosis, as well as a primary respiratory acidosis that appears to have developed into a respiratory alkalosis, and she then had difficulty weaning from the ventilator.
Additionally, she had thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia, for which Heme-Onc has been consulted.
Finally, she developed a ventilator-associated pneumonia, with CXR showing a right hilar infiltrate and possible left lower lobe consolidation, and BAL sample showing GPRs, so she has been covered broadly with Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Ciprofloxacin.
Unfortunately, her delirium recurred.
Neurology included recommendations, based on which Keppra has been discontinued.
A brain MR has been ordered to help determine etiology of patient's hallucinations and delusions and  demonstrated no acute changes and no evidence of intracranial metastases.
Head CT without contrast showed no acute changes.
Blood cultures showed no growth.
# Pleural effusion Remained stable throught medicine course.
No treatment given.
# History of recent transaminitis LFTs followed, showed transaminitis to have resolved.
# Acute renal failure, resolved.
Followed renal function, since patient had acute renal failure with anasarca in ICU.
# Malignant HTN To anticipate eventual discharge home, anti-hypertensive regimen was simplified to Labetalol 300 mg TID, which controlled patient's blood pressure well.
# SAH Kept BP < 160.
No acute changes were seen, and it appears that products have mostly disappeared.
# Episode of asystole on telemetry Patient immediately returned to sinus rhythm.
Cardiology thought bradycardia might be nuerally meduated but also suggested Cardio a reduction in labetalol dose to 300 mg.
# History of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia has resolved.
Hematocrit remained steady during medicine course and patient had no complaints suggestive of anemia.

We treated you for some bleeding you had on your brain that may have caused you to have a seizure.
We think that the bleeding has mostly resolved now.
We also think that the bleeding was caused by high blood pressure, so it is very important that you take your blood pressure medications and follow up with your doctors.
We have also set up an appointment with a neurologist, who may also help you prevent having more bleeding on your brain.
During your stay with us, you also developed some hallucinations and were agitated.
This episode may have been caused by the bleeding in your brain or by a medication we gave you to prevent seizures or by another cause altogether.
