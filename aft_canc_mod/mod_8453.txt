Admission Date:  [**2160-12-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-12-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2089-10-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Pt is a 71 yof with h/o bladder cancer and newly found gastric mass and liver lesions, admitted with FTT x 3 weeks and hypotensive episode after EGD today.
Patient states that she has had a caugh for the past 1 day, unsure about fevers at home.
Earlier this AM ([**12-24**]) patient underwent EGD with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**], received midazolam 0.5mg IV and fentanyl 25mcg IV, subsequently with no measurable blood pressure.
CT abdomen with stable R hydroureteronephrosis and fluid overload.
On ROS, she states she has had decreased appetite secondary to nausea and [**4-17**] lb weight loss in the last 3 weeks.
She denies dysuria or change in urinary frequency but reports dark brown urine x 2 weeks.
Bladder cancer- followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9125**] of Urology, status post intravesical BCG, atrophic right kidney, chronic R ureteral lesion with R hydronephrosis, stenting unsuccessful per pt 2. s/p bilateral cataracts surgery [**2150**] 3.
Neck- no JVD Chest - CTAb.
CVR - Tachycardic, regular, 3/6 SEM heard throught ?RUB Abdomen - soft, mildly distended, no rebound or guarding Ext - trace edema bilaterally Neuro - A&O X3, able to relay history without difficulty  Pertinent Results: Admission labs: WBC 5.7, Hct 13.1, plt 84 Na 136, K 4, cl 105, bicarb 20, BUN 41, Cr 2.4 .
small qwaves inferiorly.
low limb lead voltage.
There may be superimposed mild edema or more chronic interstitial lung disease evident.
New bilateral pleural effusions, small amount of ascites, and free fluid in the pelvis are consistent with volume overload.
2. stable severe right hydronephrosis.
3. diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
4. hiatal hernia.
5. liver lesions better seen on prior ct with contrast.
Interval worsening of the right-sided hydroureteronephrosis with interval increase in size of a distal ureteral enhancing lesion suspicious for tumor versus progression of scar tissue.
Interval development of the gastric antral mass and peri-celiac and intra aorta caval lymphadenopathy is suspicious for gastric adenocarcinoma, less likely lymphoma.
In addition, there has been interval development of multiple lesions within the liver, which are suspicious for metastatic disease.
Four 1-2 mm nodules in the right lower lobe, which are most likely inflammatory.
Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
A large probably sessile mass is seen in the body of the left atrium, occupying the majority of the chamber, but does not appear to be occluding the mitral valve.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 71 yof with h/o bladder cancer and recently found gastric mass with liver involvement admitted with hypotension.
Ms [**Known lastname **] was considered likely to be significantly hypovolemic considering her h/o decreased po intake, her urine electrolyes which were prerenal, and her physical exam including flat neck veins, tachycardia, hypotension.
She was felt less likely to be septic given her lack of fever or leukocytosis but was nevertheless treated for CAP.
She was unfortunately found on ecchocardiogram to have a large sessile mass nearly occluding her right atrium.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] eventually became quite tachypneic with labored breathing and evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR (although it is likely that her tachypnea was also fueled by her serious metabolic acidosis with a bicarb of 8).
She was also noted to have thrombocytopenia and labs consistent with DIC.
Because of Ms. [**Known lastname 17064**] underlying poor prognosis with an atrial mass and likely malignancy, discussions were had with the patient and her nephew [**Name (NI) 382**] and they decided to not pursue further invasive care such as central line placement and vasopressors.
She was made comfort measures only and received only one dose of 2mg morphine for respiratory discomfort and she passed away within 30 minutes with her family at her side.
