The patient was hospitalized at OSH from [**Date range (1) 87437**] for diverticular bleed with a colonoscopy showing a site of active diverticular bleeding estimated at 45cm.
No other active sites were identified to the level of the cecum.
5 clips were placed at the site of diverticular bleeding and epinephrine was injected.
An EGD did not reveal blood from above.
The patient reportedly became hypoxic during the colonoscopy, thought to be due to an aspiration event.
This morning of his current admission, the patient awoke and had two episodes of maroon stools.
He had no light-headedness at the time, but endorsed crampy abdominal pain.
In the ED, he became very dizzy and light-headed.
He had some dyspnea on exertion, but denied nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, continued cough, constipation, straining, or tenesmus.
He was admitted to the MICU for further management of his presumed continued lower GI bleed.
Pt was complaining of light-headedness but no abdominal pain.

He received a total of 6 units of packed RBCs and underwent colonoscopy, which was negative for acute bleeding.
The patient was transferred to the floor, where he continued to have maroon stools.
A tagged RBC was performed, which did not show evidence of active bleed.
A second colonoscopy and EGD were performed because of concern for upper, rather than lower GI bleed, but these studies again did not show evidence of acute bleeding.
He was noted to have extensive diverticulosis and a duodenal polyp (biopsied).
He was discharged with follow up with GI for a capsule endoscopy, and with instructions to return to the emergency department for dark or bloody stools.
He was advised to discuss restarting aspirin low dose with his PCP after completion of evaluation for GI bleeding.
The patient's following chronic medical problems remained stable and were treated as follows.
