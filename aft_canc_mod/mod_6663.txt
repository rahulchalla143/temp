He was taken to [**Location (un) **] ED where he was noted to have worsening mental status and was intubated for airway protection without sedation needed.
CT scan of his head was performed which reportedly demonstrated bilateral SDH with midline shift and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for neurosurg eval.
Prior to transfer, he did receive 0.5mg atropine for bradycardia.
Repeat head CT large right subdural hematoma with marked mass effect and 17 mm subfalcine herniation, small left posterior parietal subdural hematoma, and uncal herniation with deformity of the brainstem.
Neurosurgery was consulted and upon review of his images, recommended, "no neurosurgical intervention indicated at this time, findings are incompatible with life."
Of note, wife reports he was recently admitted to [**Hospital 11373**] for "delirium" and black stool at which time he was found to have UGIB requiring 7 Units prbcs.
During that admission, wife reports patient had a "heart attack" and was started on several new medications for "congestive heart failure".
She also notes increased confusion over the past [**2-12**] months and trouble word finding.
He had a fall nearly 1 month ago at which time he hit the back of his head, but was discharged home from the ED at that time; it is unclear if he had imaging then.
Past Medical History: "Aplastic anemia" Myelodysplasia s/p MI during recent [**Location (un) **] hospitalization medically managed Congestive heart failure (new diagnosis) Clot in IVC Lower extremity DVT, previously on coumadin (d/c'd approx 2 years ago) B12 deficiency Pulmonary nodule COPD Colonic polyps Anxiety Abdominal hernia "Enlarged liver" Osteoarthritis Atrial fibrillation s/p vein stripping   Social History: Lives with wife in [**Name (NI) 60509**], [**Name (NI) **].
No h/o illicits.
HEENT: Pupils fixed and dilated bilaterally.
No e/o head trauma anteriorly.
Soft systolic murmur heard greatest LLSB.
Multiple firm masses felt superficially throughout abdomen.
Ext: 2+ pitting edema to knees.
Dependant edema posterior thighs and buttocks.
Skin: Venous stasis skin changes bilateral LEs.
Weak corneal reflexes bilaterally.
No gag reflex, weak cough with deep suctioning.
No spontaneous movements.
[**2116-11-13**] CT HEAD - FINDINGS: There is a 13 x 3.6 cm subdural hematoma abutting the left frontal and parietal and into the left temporal regions inferiorly.
There is marked vasogenic edema, with mass effect on the frontal, lateral and temporal horns of the left lateral ventricle.
There is also small right posterior parietal sub-dural hematoma.
There are no fractures.
IMPRESSION: Large right subdural hematoma with marked mass effect and 17 mm subfalcine herniation.
Small left posterior parietal subdural hematoma.There is uncal herniation with deformity of the brainstem.
Brief Hospital Course: 79yo M with h/o myelodysplasia, recent UGIB, s/p recent MI presents following mechanical fall with SDH and herniation s/p intubation at OSH.
# The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evaluation of a large left subdural hematoma.
He was evaluated by neurosurgery in the emergency room and was found to be unresponsive with GCS 3T and pupils fixed and dilated.
Repeat CT head demonstrated a large left subdural hematoma with uncal and subfalacine herniation.
She was understanding that despite keeping him ventilated, he could experience arrhythmia or bradycardia due to his intracranial process that could be life threatening.
The evening of admission the patient sustained a cardiac arrest and expired.
