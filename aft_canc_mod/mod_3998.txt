History of Present Illness: 35yoM with HIV/AIDS, recently started on HAART, and an aggressive high-grade AIDS-related Burkitt's-like lymphoma (initially presented with a RLQ mass).
He was admitted for further workup of failure to thrive, including r/o infection (given severe immunocompromise), and possible bm bx to r/o marrow infiltration by tumor.
Past Medical History: 1) HIV+: diagnosed [**2123**], started HAART in [**2134-3-3**] 2) AIDS-related Burkitt's-like lymphoma: Diagnosed [**10/2133**] after sx of fever/night sweats and RLQ abd pain CT with large mass medial to the right psoas encasing the right external iliac artery with surrounding adenopathy bx confirmed the diagnosis of AIDS-related Burkitt's-like lymphoma.

CV: RRR, nl s1s2, no murmurs.
chest: CTA b/l, no crackles or wheezes.
CXR: Lung volumes remain low and the infrahilar opacity at the medial aspects of both lung bases could be atelectasis or pneumonia.
There is no pleural effusion or indication of new central adenopathy.
Widening of the right paratracheal stripe has been present and without appreciable change since at least [**2133-10-31**].
Minor non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities are now noted and may be due in part to the rapid rate.
No pulmonary embolism.
Bilateral small pleural effusions.
No evidence of abscess.

On further evaluation, it was thought that he may have progressive lymphoma w/ failure on CODOX-MTX (s/p 2 cycles) alternating with IVAC (s/p 2 cycles).
Preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**] of peripheral smear suggested high percentage of blasts.
lymphoma: Patient has progressive lymphoma with large tumor burden with concern for tumor lysis syndrome (WBC 90K, LDH 20K).
Despite receiving multiple chemotherapy regimens, his WBC continued to rise, and his peripheral smear showed an increasing percentage of blasts.
fevers: Source of infection was unclear; all cultures were negative.
tachycardia: Pt had persistent tachycardia, and EKG showed a sinus rhythm.
He had no signs of active bleeding.
Ppx: neutropenic precautions, bowel regimen; no heparin as pt had low platelet count.
Hydromorphone 2 mg PO Q4-6H PRN pain 9.
