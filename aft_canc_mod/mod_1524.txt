Admission Date:  [**2185-7-12**]       Discharge Date:  [**2185-7-27**]  Date of Birth:   [**2130-12-10**]       Sex:  F  Service:  GYN/ONCOLOGY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54-year-old female with history of metastatic breast cancer since [**2178**] who was admitted on [**2185-7-12**] for resection of a pelvic mass and ureterolysis.
The patient is status post diagnosis in [**2182**] of bony metastases and status post STAMP in [**2183-7-17**] via an allodonor.
In [**2185-5-17**], the patient was found to have bilateral hydronephrosis.
This was discovered incidentally during a CT for her breast cancer followup and restaging.
A subsequent MRI demonstrated bilateral large adnexal masses (most likely Krukenberg tumors-metastases from breast) causing hydronephrosis.
The patient was referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5166**] for removal of her bilateral adnexal masses for the purposes of diagnosis as well as relief of her bilateral hydronephrosis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is an obese white female in no apparent distress.
The abdomen was soft, obese, and nontender with no palpable masses.
Pelvic examination was as follows:  Adnexal masses were not appreciated secondary to the patient's body habitus.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2185-7-12**] where an exploratory laparotomy, radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and ureterolysis on the right side were performed.
Her estimated blood loss was 1200 cc.
In the morning she was extubated without difficulty.
Ultrasound showed continued hydronephrosis.
This was done without complication on Sunday, [**2185-7-17**].
Of note, she was marrow suppressed secondary to her chemotherapy.
She did have a copious post obstructive diuresis of approximately 11 liters per day for several days.
The patient did occasionally need electrolyte repletement which was achieved without difficulty.
The patient's postoperative course was also remarkable for a temperature spike to 101.6 on [**2185-7-20**].
Blood and urine cultures subsequently grew out Escherichia coli and Klebsiella.
After some manipulation and dressing changes, the leaking was prevented.
There was a small amount of skin breakdown which was improved dramatically with Desitin and dressing changes.
She has no active issues at this point.
b.i.d., Desitin apply to affected area around nephrostomy site as needed, Xylocaine to affected area as needed.
PATHOLOGY:  The pathology returned as metastatic breast cancer for all specimens from the surgery.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Metastatic breast cancer; hypertension; question diabetes insipidus (workup in progress); Escherichia coli and Klebsiella bacteremia; bilateral hydronephrosis.
