However, his gastric lavage was negative in the ED and repeat EGD in house showed only mild gastritis without evidence of active bleeding.
A lower source seemed less likely given melanotic stools as well as a recent colonoscopy at outside hospital which showed multiple polyps which were removed at that time.
He had no further melanotic stools.
He received a total of 4 units PRBCs over the course of the admission with appropriate response in his hematocrit and no further evidence of bleeding.
He tolerated the volume well without evidence of volume overload on exam.
Not anticoagulated with h/o GI bleed.
Pt to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a small bowel capsule endoscopy per GI consult.
