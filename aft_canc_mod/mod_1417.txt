Admission Date:  [**2154-3-29**]     Discharge Date:  [**2154-4-12**]  Date of Birth:                  Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 86-year-old male with atrial fibrillation on Coumadin with diabetes, coronary artery disease who presented to [**Hospital3 7571**]Emergency Department on [**2154-3-27**] with weakness and change in mental status.
Patient presented again with similar symptoms and upper respiratory congestion and workup revealed elevated liver function tests as well as an elevated white blood cell count, coagulopathy, and hypoxemia with bilateral lower lobe infiltrates on chest x-ray.
Patient was also found with complaints of abdominal pain more so on the right side.
A CT of the abdomen showed a dilated gallbladder with wall thickening and a large stone with mild common bile duct dilatation.
Patient's creatinine was elevated, as well, showing acute and chronic renal failure.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Atrial fibrillation.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
Gastrectomy for peptic ulcer disease.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.
Patient has decreased breath sounds at the right base.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed a gallbladder with wall thickening and sludge, a 1.5 cm stone, common bile duct measuring 11 mm with mild intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
Patient was taken to the Operating Room for presumed cholecystitis on [**2154-3-30**].
What was found included a distal common bile duct/pancreas tumor with metastases to the liver, hepatic abscess with a biliary leak.
Postoperatively, the patient experienced some hypotension requiring a Neo-Synephrine drip in the Recovery Room as well as difficult-to-manage hypoglycemia requiring D10 drip.
When a room was made available the patient was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit where a number of interventions were continued as well as started, including treatment for his hypoglycemia, treatment for his coagulopathy.
The patient had an echocardiogram performed which showed an ejection fraction of greater than 35%, moderate aortic valve stenosis, 3+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, and patient was started on total parenteral nutrition.
Patient was also treated for acute tubular necrosis.
Toward the end of his stay the patient appeared to have possibly had a seizure requiring Ativan treatment.
Over the approximately two weeks in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient remained intubated with a difficult respiratory wean.
This decision made largely due to a) the patient's failure to wean and failure to improve from a mental status point of view as well as b) the patient's dismal prognosis secondary to his tumor burden.
