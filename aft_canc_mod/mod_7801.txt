Admission Date:  [**2194-12-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2194-12-17**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine; Iodine Containing  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**] Chief Complaint: Metastatic Lung Cancer  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 83 yo M with a past medical history significant for CAD and AAA repair, with a very recent diagnosis of NSCLC with intracranial and bony metastasis, presents today to the ED after wife noted increased lethargy and decreased PO intake beginning Saturday (2 days prior to presentation).
His wife reports some abdominal distention but denies n/v/f/c.
He has not had a BM in three to four days and is passing no flatus currently.
An NGT was placed to suction and about 600cc+ of liquid black gastric contents was drained.
At this time, GI was consulted and felt that this was not evidence of UGIB and that there was no acute indication for EGD.
He is admitted to the MICU for further monitoring in the setting of gastric distention secondary to possible gastric outlet obstruction with tachycardia.
His oncologic history as noted above is a very recent diagnosis of metastatic NSCLC with mets in cerebellum and bone.
He was diagnosed after experiencing pleuritic chest pain (different from his stable angina) and a CT on [**11-23**] showed a spiculated mass in the right upper lobe,pretracheal and precarinal right hilar lymph nodes.
The patient subsequently experienced severe LBP and an MRI of L-spine showed multi-level metastatic disease with no compression of spinal cord or cauda equina.
Past Medical History: AAA repair (asymptomatic 6.1cm AAA) [**12-22**] Hyperlipidemia CAD, h/o IMI Stable angina Cross fem bypass for claudication [**1-22**] HTN BPH h/o hemorrhoidal bleeding  Social History: Stopped smoking 15 years ago.
He and wife are financially responsible for their son, who is unable to work secondary to psychiatric problems.
They have undergone quite a lot of psychologic stress secondary to this and resultant financial harships.
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS: Temp: 98.6 BP: 98/64 HR: 117 RR: 17 O2sat 95% Ra GEN: pleasant, comfortable, NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, MM dry, op without lesions.
NGT in place NECK: no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, carotids with sharp upstroke, no carotid bruits, no JVD no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules RESP: decreased bs at the right base, otherwise, clear.
No acute intra-abdominal pathology including no evidence of gastric outlet obstruction.
Patchy bibasilar opacities are concerning for pneumonia and/or aspiration.
Monoiliac-type aortic graft with known occlusion of the left common iliac artery and fem-fem bypass graft.
Prostatic enlargement.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 84 yo M with h/o of CAD and recent diagnosis of stage IV NSCLC with metastases to his brain and bone presents with delirium, concern for aspiration pneumonia, and NSTEMI from demand ischemia.
# Delirium: Initially felt to be secondary to possible pneumonia vs. over sedation from opiates, yet poor mental status persisted despite treatment of pneumonia and pulling back on pain medication.
Other contributing factors included hypernatremia (resolved), ICU psychosis, and untreated pain from bone metastases.
Known brain metastases likely another contributing factor.
Despite treatment of all possible reversible etiologies, continued to have decreased mental status.
Given poor prognosis and failure to resume noteworthy function, patient was made DNR/DNI and later CMO.
# Non-small cell lung cancer:  At initial diagnosis was stage IV with metastatic lesions to his brain and bones.
Oncology consulted initially on admission and later met with family [**12-16**] and informed them that he is not a candidate for chemotherapy because of his medical illness and poor performance status.
# Respiratory Distress/Pneumonia: While inpatient he had episodes of respiratory distress that probably resulted from several factors, including his underlying pneumonia, difficulty clearing secretions, pain, and anxiety.
Leukocytosis and infiltrates persisted despite treatment with Flagyl and ceftriaxone.
Later Zosyn and vancomycin were started to cover possible nosocomial pathogens.
Respiratory distress continued to be progressive despite antibiotics and suctioning.
Once CMO status, his pain and distress with treated with morphine as needed until he expired.
# Demand Ischemia/Tachycardia: Upon admission was found to be actively having a NSTEMI from demand ischemia in setting of tachycardia.
Tachycardia remained and appeared to be multifactorial including pain and agitation.
He was treated with gentle IV fluids, morphine for pain and Lopressor as tolerated until he expired.
# Hematuria: Noted while inpatient and thought to be due to trauma associated with Foley placement/patient tugging on Foley.
# Renal Failure:  Cr slowly increased during his hospitalization, likely associated with pre-renal etiology.
# Pain control:  Patient with significant pain, likely secondary to known bone metastates.
While inpatient, was started on a fentanyl patch and given IV morphine as needed for breakthrough pain.
