History of Present Illness:  This is a 51 year-old Female with a stage IV breast cancer with mets to liver who was admitted to ACS on [**2122-7-13**] with a port line infection which was subsequently removed on [**2122-7-13**].
Initial blood cultures grew MSSA and Enterococcus and she was started on Vancomycin.
She was then transferred to the medicine service on [**2122-7-20**] for bacteremia management and progressive dyspnea.
She received a TEE on [**2122-7-21**] that was negative for vegetations.
Chest imaging revealed bilateral loculated pleural effusions prompting left VATS and chest tube placement on [**2122-7-21**] with the pleural fluid growing MSSA.
Her shortness of breath progressed and she required up to 4L NC.
She had a CTA on [**2122-7-23**] that did not reveal central or lobar PE, but segmental/subsegmental PE could not be ruled out.
She was briefly started on heparin, but this was discontinued due to persistent right sided empyema as leading cause of hypoxia.

Brief Hospital Course: This is a 51 year-old Female with a stage IV breast cancer with mets to liver who was admitted to ACS on [**2122-7-13**] with a port line infection which was subsequently removed on [**2122-7-13**].

Her shortness of breath progressed and she required up to 4L NC.

She was briefly started on heparin, but this was discontinued due to persistent right sided empyema as leading cause of hypoxia.
She received IV dilaudid for pain control.
Upon evaluation in the PACU, she was lethargic, awaking to voice, but with poor attention and not answering questions coherently, intermittently moaning in pain.
In brief, the summary of the patient's active issues at discharge:  51F with metastatic stage IV breast CA admitted to ACS for port-line infection with subsequent removal of line, found to have MSSA/Enterococcal bacteremia, and development of B/L empyemas s/p multiple chest tubes who required MICU admission for hypotension, previously on pressors.
# Fluid balance - The patient's hypotension resolved shortly before transfer to the floor on [**2122-7-27**].
# BILATERAL EMPYEMAS, CHEST TUBES, DYSPNEA - Pt was noted to have increasing dyspnea, and bilateral pleural effusions were noted on [**2122-7-19**].
CT confirmed the presence of loculated pleural effusions.
Pt is s/p bilateral VATS on the left side [**2122-7-21**] and the right side on [**2122-7-24**].
Pt received b/l drainage and pleural biopsy.
The last chest tube was successfully removed on [**2122-7-29**], and subsequent CXR has shown no return of effusions with notmal lung spaces.
*Atypical epithelial cells recovered from VATS suspicious for malignancy.
Pt's pain has been effectively controlled with Dilaudid PO 4 mg Q4H PRN; oxycodone 20 mg PO BID.
Pt has been relatively pain free with only ocasional need for the Dilaudid.
# Port infection - PT was admitted for a port infection on [**2122-7-13**] to acute care surgery.
The wound shows evidence of good granulation tissue.
# ANEMIA - evidence of downward trending hematocrit is likely due to worsening chronic disease.
Pt has been consistently guaiac negative, and a hemolytic work-up was negative for hemolysis.
# METASTATIC BREAST CANCER - faslodex 500mg IM was given to the patient on [**2122-8-3**].
Atypical epithelial cells suspicious for malignancy were present in tissue taken from pleural empyema.
# CONSTIPATION - Pt initially constipated, but has been stable on current bowel regimen of docusate, miralax, bisacodyl, and senna.
# ANXIETY - Pt has complained of anxiety, but has been stable on Lorazepam 1 mg PO Q8hrs for anxiety.
