Downsloping ST depressions in V5-6.
Tachycardia is new and axis is shifting toward negative in aVF and II compared to prior dated [**2129-1-18**].
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Patchy ground-glass opacity with increased interstitial prominence is consistent with mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
Perfusion abnormality in the liver may reflect the underlying heart failure.
CXR ([**2131-1-1**]): Preliminary read, interval increase in size of cardiac silhouette, which could be partially secondary to techinical differences, however, possible pericardial effusion versus worsening cardiomyopathy cannot be excluded.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
