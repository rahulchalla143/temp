HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 49-year-old man with renal cell carcinoma with metastases to the lungs and spine, who presented today to [**Hospital1 18**] for elective BAL bronchoscopy by IP to rule out infection.
The patient had a CAT scan in [**4-/2170**], which showed interval progression of intrathoracic metastatic disease.
Right paramediastinal mass to be associated with compression of the right upper lobe bronchus and associated atelectasis.
There was also evidence of lymphangitic spread of tumor involving right upper lobe.
The pulmonary team was aware of this, however, there was still a question of infection in this area.
The patient had a baseline cough for approximately one year; however, his shortness of breath was increasingly worse over the past 2 weeks.
On bronchoscopy, the team found a right upper lobe endobronchial mucous plug.
Up on suctioning of this plug, there was an underlying lesion which began to bleed.
The bleeding was successfully stopped.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for chest pain or shortness of breath.
He had some chronic throat discomfort.
Status post left nephrectomy.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction.
Elevated cholesterol.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
He had no episodes of hemoptysis.
He had no episodes of lightheadedness or dizziness.
The patient stated that he felt at baseline and that his breathing was better than it had been prior to his elective bronchoscopy.
The medical team felt that this was acceptable given his known blood loss during bronchoscopy.
The patient's Plavix and aspirin were held during his hospitalization for his increased risk of bleeding.
There were no other events during this hospitalization.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Renal cell carcinoma with metastatic disease to lung and spine.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction.
Status post left nephrectomy.
Status post hemoptysis in the setting of bronchoscopy.
