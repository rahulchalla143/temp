These ar early signs of pericardial tamponade.
Post pericardial window, small effusion with normal biventricular systolic function.
Previously noted possible pneumothorax was likely artifact.
Worsening atelectasis of retrocardiac left lower lobe and a small left pleural effusion.
[**2181-5-2**] Liver: 1) No discrete hepatic lesion identified.
Rare atypical epithelioid cells - cannot exclude carcinoma; numerous pulmonary macrophages, bronchial epithelial cells, and squamous cells.
Bronchial Brushing: Bronchial brush: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Numerous bronchial epithelial cells, squamous cells, and some pulmonary macrophages.
Evolving subacute infarction in the left posterior cerebral artery territory.
Small regions of hemorrhagic transformation.
No aneurysm, significant stenosis, or occlusion of the major vessels of the head and neck.
Likely metastatic lesion in the right side of the T12 vertebral body extending into the pedicle and lamina, as well as extending into the epidural space.
No evidence of signal abnormality in the thoracic cord.
Areas of signal abnormality in the T3, T7, and T10 vertebral bodies are most consistent with hemangiomas when correlated with the bone scan and CT findings.
Bilateral kidney cysts.
Incompletely visualized left-sided lung masses, and reference should also be made to the CT of the torso for further evaluation of these.
[**2181-5-8**] CT Chest: CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Non-dependent loculated left pleural effusion has evolved in the interval.
Another area of loculated effusion is seen anteriorly in the left lung as well.
In the left lower lobe, there are multiple peripheral masses.
One of these has a small calcification (3, 32).
In the left upper lobe, there are two nodules measuring 1.4 x 1.6 cm, and a larger mass measuring 2.1 x 2.6 cm (3, 16).
New areas of ground-glass rounded opacities are seen in the right upper lobe (3, 24) measuring up to 11 mm in size.
Large pericardial effusion is unchanged.
No enlarged hilar nodes are seen.
There is no pneumothorax.
CT ABDOMEN: Evaluation of intra-abdominal organs is limited due to the lack of intravenous contrast.
Given this limitation, there is no renal stone seen on either side.
No enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph nodes are present.
Small areas of low density in the liver are incompletely characterized but present in the left [**Last Name (un) **] (6 mm [**2-/2125**]) and in the right lobe ([**2-/2128**] two small lesions and a small lesion on [**2-/2130**]).
Small low density lesions in the interpolar region of the right kidney are simple cysts.
There is no free fluid in the pelvis.
IMPRESSION: Multiple pulmonary masses and nodules in this patient with prior history of breast cancer and destructive lesion of right T12 vertebral body extending into the foramen and spinal canal at this level.
There is a small to moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of hemodynamic compromise.
[**2181-5-9**] CT Head: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
No abnormal foci of enhancement are noted in the brain parenchyma elsewhere, to suggest metastatic disease.
No osseous lytic or sclerotic lesions are noted.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
[**2181-5-10**] T12 biopsy: FNA, T12 Vertebral Body: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent with metastatic poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma.
The left lower lobe atelectasis and known left upper lung masses and nodules are unchanged.
The chronic left fourth rib fracture is again noted.
Brief Hospital Course: Discharge Summary: # Pericardial Effusion: As mentioned in the HPI, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from OSH with a pericardial effusion.
Upon admission she had an Echocardiogram which showed a large pericardial effusion with early tamponade physiology.
On post-operative day one she required transfusion of pRBC d/t low HCT.
She was started on beta blockers in the setting of new onset Atrial Flutter and gentle diuresis was initiated.
Oncology was also consulted for possible metastatic disease vs primary lung cancer.
Pericardial window tissue culture- no growth, cytology: No malignancy identified.
A stat bedside echo was done which showed a small to moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of hemodynamic compromise.
No signs/symptoms of tamponade on exam.
# Metastases: On the medical floor, pt had an extensive work up of her metastatic disease without a known primary.
The CT scans at the OSH show multiple metastic lesions in lungs, spine(T6/11/12), and small lesion in liver.
The heme/onc service was consulted and recommended bone scan, tumor markers, and a biopsy of tissue for diagnosis.
Pt had Bone scan [**2181-5-2**] which showed lesions in L1 vertebral body and right posterior 5th rib concerning for metastatic disease.
She had an MR thoracic spine shows T 12 met which does not break into cord, no conus or cord involvement seen.
Bronchial washings did show Rare atypical epithelioid cells - carcinoma could not be excluded.
Interventional radiology was consulted for CT guided transthoracic biopsy, however, when the patient went down for the procedure she was noted to be tachycardic and had INR of 1.5.
Oncology was involved throughout and based on the patient's other illnesses there were no available treatment options.
# s/p CVA: On the medical floor, pt was noted to have visual field defects.
Pt had a CT of her head with a subacute infarct in the region of PCA- 4x6cm left occipital lobe.
No metastasis were noted on CT.
The neurology service was consulted and recommended MRI/MRA of her head which showed vessels in the neck without stenoses, subacute infarct again visualized in region of PCA.
Pt had had recent TEE without signs of endocarditis and a repeat TTE which did not show clots.
The issue of anticoagulation came up with regard to atrial fibrillation as well as discovery of segmental PEs.
A repeat CT head showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage and an evolving left PCA territory subacute infarct.
Per neurology recommendations, heparin gtt was started with low goal and close monitoring of mental status.
# Optic neuropathy: Ophthalmology service was also consulted, possible retinal metastasis was visualized and it was determined that pt needed further retinal evaluation.
# C. diff: With regard to her C.difficile colitis- pt was initially continued on Flagyl, however, her white count continued to trend up.
# Atrial fibrillation: With regard to her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation she had episodes of RVR in the 140's.
She was asymptomatic with rapid heart rates.
# Pleural effusion: With regard to her Left pleural effusion- lasix IV prn was used for diuresis.
# PNA: Due to some fevers and elevated white count, there was concern for PNA.
Ground glass opacities were seen in RUL representing possible infection so she was started on Zosyn/Vancomycin, switched to Unasyn from Zosyn on [**5-10**].
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] at Silver [**Doctor Last Name **] Commons  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic carcinoma of unknown primary Atrial fibrillation with RVR Pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology C. Diff colitis Hospital acquired pneumonia Pulmonary embolus Oliguria Subacute CVA Pleural effusions Dyslipidemia   Discharge Condition: Tachypneic.
Metastatic lesions were found on CT scan and an extensive work up was done to determine where the primary site was, however no primary malignancy was found.
