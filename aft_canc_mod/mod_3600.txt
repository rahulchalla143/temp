He also has lesions in his sternum as well as his lung.
He has a low ejection fraction.
There is no evidence of myelopathy or hyperreflexia or balance disturbance.
He has minimal to no tenderness to palpation, but does feel a difference in palpating his upper thoracic spine versus his lumbar, lower thoracic spine.
He definitely has referred shoulder pain either from this sternal lesions or the lung lesions.
Imaging:  A CT was performed today, which shows a pathologic fracture through the T2 vertebral body.
At this point, given the nature of his fracture and a lytic lesion, I would recommend stabilization.
This involves a minimum of C7-T4 posterior spinal fusion with perhaps some isolated decompression at T2.
There is both the risk of paralysis with leaving him alone as well as operative procedure.
