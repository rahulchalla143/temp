VNA this am noted a O2sat of 90% on ra and that his breathing seemed short so recommended he be evaluated.

Past Medical History: Oncologic # duodenal adenocarcinoma: - [**2164-4-28**]: developed crampy abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice.
ERCP revealed a malignant appearing stricture and also a duodenal mass.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] had discussed the potential for a Whipple procedure; however, given Mr. [**Known lastname 12330**]' comorbidities and underlying medical problems and delirium, he was not deemed a good candidate for Whipple's and was deemed to be a better candidate for a less invasive procedure.

[**2164-8-31**] CXR: Large left pleural effusion with retrocardiac left lung base atelectasis.
Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
[**2164-8-31**] CT Head without contrast: No acute intracranial hemorrhage detected.
Right maxillary sinus disease.
No acute pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic pathology detected.
Stable mild enlargement of the ascending thoracic aorta measuring up to 3.9 cm.
Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion and associated compressive atelectasis of the left lower lobe, new since the prior study.
Interval worsening of the patient's known acute pancreatitis with increase in size of the previously seen peripancreatic fluid collections.
Splenic subscapular simple fluid collection is new since the prior study.
Hypoattenuating lesions within the head of the pancreas may represent dilated ducts or small fluid collections.
Unchanged thickened appearance of the first and second portion of the duodenum in this patient with known duodenal mass.
Multiple omental and peritoneal nodules remain concerning for carcinomatosis.
Renal cysts and sigmoid diverticulosis.
[**2164-9-1**] ECG: Atrial flutter with ventricular premature beats.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
Since previous tracing of [**2164-8-31**] atrial wave forms now appear more suggestive of flutter than fibrillation but there may be no significant change.
[**2164-9-2**] CXR: Large left effusion with adjacent atelectasis has markedly increased.
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
Right lower atelectasis is unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 12330**] is an 84yo man with duodenal adenocarcinoma s/p gastroenterostomy who presented with worsening lethargy and tachypnea.
# Fever/Leukocytosis: Pt w persistent leukocytosis ([**10-12**]) of unclear etiology, with acute elevation to 24 on admission.
Given tender abdomen and abdominal CT findings with large fluid collections, this was felt to be the most likely source of infection.
PNA was also considered given his pleural effusions, but it was felt that these were most likely secondary to abdominal inflammation.
The patient was broadly covered with Vanco and Meropenem (started [**2164-9-1**]) for intra-abdominal infection / possible PNA.
Surgery felt that drainage of fluid collections in abdomen would put the patient at risk for bleeding or infection with minimal benefit.
His cultures remained negative, but the patient remained intermittently febrile with continued lethargy and poor mental status.
Overnight patient became agitated and pulled out peripheral IVs.
After arrival to the medical oncology floor, the patient continued to receive symptomatic treatment.
# Tachypnea/Dyspnea - At time of admission, tachypnea was thought to be secondary to pleural effusion vs PNA vs PE.
No sign of PNA on CXR or physical exam, pt w prior diagnosis of PE and was therapeutic on lovenox, effusion more likely the cause.
Given the large abdominal fluid collection, effusion was thought to be most likely secondary to abdominal process as discussed above.
# Altered mental status - Most likely delirium related to malignancy, likely also with infectious component.
After decision was made to make comfort measures only the goal of care, the patient received symptomatic treatment with morphine (liquid) as needed for pain or dyspnea, ondansetron as needed for nausea, acetaminophen as needed for pain, and lorazepam as needed for anxiety or nausea.
