FEMUR AP/LAT: Displaced and overriding right femoral subtrochanteric fracture .
PELVIS AP: Right-sided subtrochanteric femoral fracture .
CT LE: Comminuted, markedly angulated and displaced fracture of the subtrochanteric femur with involvement of the lesser trochanter.
No free air is detected.
Improved alignment of the comminuted fracture.
No dislocation.
In this patient status post right femur fixation surgery, there are expected surgical changes and moderate soft tissue edema.
No large hematoma in the surgical site or retroperitoneal bleed to explain the patient's symptoms.
Recommend correlation with clinical symptoms because there is an increased risk of perforation.
Although this probably represents severe post-operative ileus with colonic dilatation as suggested in the clinical history, the possibility of a distal obstruction cannot be excluded radiographically.
This most likely represents a profound adynamic ileus.
KUB [**2148-5-12**]: Chronic, marked colonic dilatation is unchanged from the preceding radiograph and also seen as far back as CT of [**2146-8-9**].
Brief Hospital Course: 62 yo F with severe mental retardation, afib, and history of Hodgkin's, admitted with a displaced right proximal femur fracture.
# Acute Blood Loss Anemia/Hypotension: On post-op day 2 pt was found to have BP 80/50 on 8 AM vitals with HR in 120s.
EKG was rapid and regular with poor baseline - either sinus tach or aflutter.
Pt was asymptomatic but had lip pallor.
1L NS was hung wide open and ortho was asked to evaluate post-op site for internal bleeding.
Ortho did not feel there was high concern for bleeding into thigh.
No other e/o bleeding, such as bloody stool or flank ecchymosis.
Pt remained asymptomatic during this period and was alert and talkative.
There was no evidence of bleeding from GI tract.
# Right femur fracture s/p ORIF: Found to have right leg pain with xrays showing a displaced proximal femur fracture.
No mechanism of injury identified by the nursing home, raising concerns for a pathological fracture, especially in light of history of Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Pain well-controlled with tylenol and pt resting comfortably and denying pain.
Biopsy was taken at the time of surgery to evaluate for malignancy but was pending at the time of discharge.
# UTI: Found to have UTI on admission with pyuria and moderate bacteria on u/a.
Following her hypotension as above, she was broadened to vanc/cefepime but was switched back to ceftriaxone prior to call-out to the floor.
On floor, CTX was continued for duration of UTI course, last day [**2148-5-13**].
# S. bovis: organism seen most commonly in pathologic states in [**Month/Day/Year 499**], such as malignancy or fistula per GI (consulting) and ID (curbside) but can also be part of normal colonic flora.
Pt had CT A/P which showed no masses that would be concerning for malignancy.
It also showed no evidence of inflammation/conduit to bladder that would be concerning for fistula.
While pt had bleeding leading to MICU, she never had rectal bleeding that would be concerning for colonic malignancy and she had a more likely source of bleeding, which was the recent thigh operation in which she lost 700cc of blood intraop.
If family concerned or new sx develop, can pursue colonoscopy as outpatient, however, this was not indicated based on the existing data.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Thought to be related to pericardial and pleural effusion that occurred in the setting of chemotherapy, requiring a pericardial window.
# Chronic Ileus: This has been an ongoing problem all of her life, and in the past required a temporary colostomy.
Continued senna, miralax, and bisacodyl PR in house and added docusate.
Having regular BM in house but abdomen markedly distended (denied pain) so KUB ordered after surgery in PACU to eval but was mostly unchanged from prior imaging and shows no free air.
CT abdomen and pelvis showed severely dilated loops of bowel to as large as 16cm yet patient was without abdominal pain, fevers, white count, or HD compromise to suggest colitis or megacolon.
Patient having bowel movements.
GI performed a colonic decompression by sigmoidoscopy and temporary placement of rectal tube with frequent repositioning to help relieve gas.
Her abdominal distension improved and she had no abd pain so she was discharged on a generous bowel regimen.
# Mental Retardation: Appeared at her baseline per her family.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital because you had a fracture in your femur.
You had surgical repair of your femur and a biopsy was taken to help identify the cause of the fracture.
You were found to have a urinary tract infection while you were here so you were treated with antibiotics for this.
Your abdomen also became very distended with gas and stool, so a gastroenterologist was consulted and they performed decompression of your [**Last Name (un) 499**].
You were also found to have low Vitamin B12 so you were started on a supplement for this.
The following changes were made to your medications: STARTED: calcium carbonate  200 mg calcium (500 mg) Tablet twice a day enoxaparin  40 mg/0.4 mL Syringe One (1) syringe Subcutaneous every night for one month (last dose [**2148-6-7**]) acetaminophen 500 mg Tablet Two (2) Tablets three times a day for 7 days, then as needed for pain after that docusate sodium  100 mg Capsule One (1) Capsule 2 times a day cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) 250 mcg Tablet  One (1) Tablet DAILY  Followup Instructions: Follow up with your primary care doctor in one week.
