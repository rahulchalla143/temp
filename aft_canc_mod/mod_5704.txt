Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo gentleman with a history of ESRD on HD, restrictive/interstitial lung disease on home 2LNC, untreated CLL, RCC s/p nephrectomy, prostate cancer, bladder cancer who was sent to the ED from outpatient follow up appointment for hypoxia.
# Hypoxia/Pulmonary Edema: Felt to be due to volume overload with change in HD schedule +/- dietary indiscretion.
Pt had no symptoms of cardiac ischemia and No fever or other symptoms to suggest infectious etiology.
No symptoms to suggest flu.
# fatigue: Felt to be due to hypoxia on presentation.
# ESRD: As above, the patient underwent a session of HD during his hospitalization and was scheduled of a repeat session as an outpaient on Monday [**1-16**].
# AV Fistula:  The patient had a right AV graft which was noted to be swollen.
An ultrasound was obtained which was suggestive of a seroma but abcess could not be ruled out.
The patient was given several doses of vancomycin for concern of infection, but it was learned that he was already prescribed a course of cephalexin for his graft as an outpatient.
# CLL/Hypogammaglobulinemia: WBC 96k on admission and IgG of 298, both of which were consistant with previously documented results.
# IBS: Continued dicyclomine.
