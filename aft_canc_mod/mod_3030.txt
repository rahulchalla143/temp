Admission Date:  [**2103-4-23**]       Discharge Date:  [**2103-4-29**]  Date of Birth:   [**2046-10-21**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56 year-old female with a history of stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer with brain metastasis diagnosed in [**2103-2-17**], SVC syndrome and coronary artery disease, status post a myocardial infarction who presented to the Emergency Room with acute shortness of breath on [**2103-4-23**].
The patient had been in her usual state of health until three days prior to admission when she began experiencing shortness of breath and mild chest pain.
Chest x-ray revealed a right pleural effusion and an increased heart size.
Her electrocardiogram showed diffuse ST changes and a stat echocardiogram was performed which showed a large pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade.
the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where she had a brief cardiac arrest.
Her rhythm remained sinus tachycardia but she had no blood pressure.
At the time of admission she was unresponsive off sedation with blood pressures in the 80s on Dopamine at maximum dose and was saturating 80 percent with an FIO2 of 100 percent on her ventilator.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Is significant for non-small cell lung cancer stage 4 diagnosed in [**2103-2-17**], for brain metastasis being treated with radiation treatment in [**2103-3-20**], status post Taxol and carboplatin treatment in [**2103-3-20**].
Her history aside from her oncologic history includes hypertension, coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction, osteoporosis, esophagitis and status post appendectomy and status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
General appearance: intubated, ill appearing female in no apparent distress.
Pupils dilated, o corneal reflexed, no doll's eyes.
Cardiac: tachycardia, distant heart sounds.
Extremities: no cyanosis, clubbing or edema but cold feet.
Neurologic: no response to pain, not moving any extremities, no corneal reflexes, no pupillary reflexes.
Electrocardiogram as stated showed diffuse ST segment elevations.
Chest x-ray had bilateral pleural effusion, right greater than left.
Cardiac catheterization results showed tamponade with 200 cc removed, diffuse coronary artery disease and status post brief cardiac arrest.
With increasing PEEP the patient experienced decrease in blood pressure.
However, her decreased O2 saturations were thought to be perhaps secondary to peripheral vasoconstriction.
Her arterial blood gases did not show this severe hypoxemia.
The patient also had her respiratory rate increase and tidal volume increased to improve her pH which was 7.19 on admission with fixed.
The patient had serial chest x-rays throughout her admission which showed a minor pleural effusion which was not immediately stopped given that the patient was unstable and given that it was unlikely to have been the cause of her respiratory distress.
The patient also showed prominent pulmonary vasculature suggestive of congestive heart failure and throughout her admission she continued to autodiurese liters of fluid.
Pulmonary embolus was suggested as a possibility of her shortness of breath, therefore once stable the patient had a CT angiogram which was negative for pulmonary embolus and negative for lymphangitic spread of the tumor.
She still had some signs of congestive heart failure and it did show a left atrial thrombus in place.
The patient did, however, have an episode of congestive heart failure of unknown cause.
In terms of rhythm the patient had had an atrial fibrillation in the emergency department and subsequently the pulse was electrical arrest.
However, in the Medical Intensive Care Unit she continued to have sinus tachycardia and normal sinus rhythm.
In term of ischemia the patient had mild coronary artery disease which was not active during her admission.
For her pericardium the patient had a drain in place and with repeat echocardiograms it was found that the drain was not putting out much output and the effusion remained small after being tapped.
3) Renal:  It was unclear whether the patient's renal failure was due to a prerenal picture secondary to decreased flow versus hypovolemia.
There was a question of congestive heart failure on chest x-ray and her CVP was elevated.
After she was extubated and off pressors she had episodes of agitation which required benzodiazepines and Haldol.
In terms of her oncologic issues the patient was seen by both oncology and by radion oncology who wished to continue to stage the patient and to continue her treatment.
At first the patient's CTAs were delayed secondary to her instability and also secondary to her agitation.
For prophylaxis the patient was given Protonix to prevent any gastrointestinal bleeding.
She had a short episode of decreased hematocrit of unclear etiology, perhaps secondary to line placement.
For access the patient had a Swan in place in her groin which was pulled, she had a right internal jugular and she had an arterial line which was placed.
The patient was discharged to the Medicine Service in stable condition and improving both in terms of her blood pressure, her urine output, her respirations and her mental status.
