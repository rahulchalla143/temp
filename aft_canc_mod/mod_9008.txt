He denies any recent head trauma.
He has had no recent cold sores or exposure to people with cold sores.

Further details of his admit physical and neurological exams, please see admit notes.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 74-year-old male who had a short episode of language difficulties that rapidly improved.
His MRI and MRA were unremarkable except for the appearance of the left temporal meningioma.
Perhaps he has a hypertensive encephalopathy, although he rapidly improved and his MRI did not show any sort of posterior leukoencephalopathy.
Another possibility would be a seizure or transient ischemic attack.
This would be a quite an unusual presentation for an acute bleed/dementia type presentation although he does have some elements of that on his exam.
While he remained in the hospital he did not have any further events similar to this one.
He was started on folate because of his elevated homocysteine.
He did have one run of tachycardia on returning from hemodialysis.
