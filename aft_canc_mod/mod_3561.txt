[**2146-8-22**] ECHO Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function(LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.

The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.

EGD [**2146-8-22**] Findings: Esophagus:  Mucosa: Moderate esophagitis with no bleeding was seen in the middle and lower thirds of the esophagus.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Patchy erythema and friability of the mucosa with contact bleeding were noted in the stomach body and antrum.
These findings are compatible with erosive gastritis.
Impression: Esophagitis and Gastritis Recommendations: Continue PPI Follow-up biopsies: f/u pathology was negative, no squamous metaplasia Monitor Hct  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 53 yoM w/ a h/o DM2, hepatitis C, CAD s/p MI, Prostate ca who presents with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and coffee ground emesis found to be in DKA.
1) Acidosis/ Diabetes Mellitus: presented with anion gap acidosis with elevated blood glucoses, urine ketones, and significantly elevated anion gap.
Suspect contribution of alcoholic ketoacidosis.
Metformin was discontinued due to patient's gastritis and esophagitis.
HgA1C 10.9% suggesting very poor glycemic control.
Patient was also sent home with diabetic teaching by a visiting nurse.
2) Abdominal pain: likely due to a combination of diabetic ketoacidosis, evidence by laboratory findings of chronic mild pancreatitis, and/or gastritis.
The patient underwent an EGD while in the hospital which revealed esophagitis and gastritis; therefore he was started on intravenous protonix [**Hospital1 **].
His pain was well controlled with tylenol and except for mild epigastric pain resolved by the time of discharge.
3) Coffee ground emesis: Patient had coffee ground emesis while in ED, which did not clear after 600 ml.
Inital EGD did not show varices or tear, but this was repeated due to retained contrast seen in the esophagus.
Repeat EGD showed esophagitis and gastritis, patient initally maintained on intravenous protonix [**Hospital1 **], but this was transitioned to prilosec [**Hospital1 **] PO for outpatient therapy.
Patient continued to experience mild nausea with eating which could be attributed to gastritis, but may also be due to esophageal dismotility/ gastroporesis.
Patient has outpatient follow-up for esophageal manometry to evaluate for potential dismotility.
Patient initially has a drop in his hematocrit post fluid resusitation from DKA and upper GI bleed, but this was stable for more than 3 days before his discharge.
Patient also reports h/o shaking with withdrawl.
Patient had regular rate when transitioned to floor and there was no evidence of withdrawl from alcohol during this hospital course.
5) Hypertension: Patient has a history of hypertension as an outpatient where he was on atenolol, hctz.
