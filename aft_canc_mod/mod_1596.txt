She did not have any chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis.
During her last admission, in addition to treatment for a heart failure exacerbation, she was also worked up for restricitve cardiomyopathy.
She had monoclonal bands in her unrine and her serum, and a bone marrow biopsy was performed as part of the workup for restrictive cardiomyopathy.
When she came to the floor, she did not have any dizziness and she was hemodynamically stable.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Hiatal Hernia - GERD - Syncopal episode in remote past   Social History: Lives at home alone, but has VNA services 3x/wk.
Sclera anicteric.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
2+ pitting edema in [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 6816**] to level of thigh.

PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Radial 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Radial 2+   Pertinent Results: [**2121-9-22**] 12:45PM   CK-MB-10 MB INDX-6.5* proBNP-[**Numeric Identifier 24248**]* [**2121-9-22**] 12:45PM   cTropnT-0.41* [**2121-9-22**] 12:45PM   CK(CPK)-154  Brief Hospital Course: HYPOTENSION/CHF: JVD, distant heart sounds, low voltage on EKG, enlarged RA and LA, lower extremity edema, pulm edema on CXR, suggest congestive heart failure,  possibly restrictive in nature.
Pt's bone marrow path results returned positive for MM and CLL.
Amyloidosis also of consideration in this patient with renal failure, monoclonal spike, anemia, possible restrictive HF.
The patient's pre-syncopal episode was likely due to orthostatic hypotension.
Pt had brief episode of hypotension on the floor and was briefly started on Levophed.
Over the next few days, several liters of fluid was removed.
Pt's "air hunger" and SOB was treated symptomatically with lasix and morphine.
# Multiple Myeloma/CLL: Bone marrow biopsy report returned positive for MM and CLL.
It did not reveal amyloidosis but that does not conclusively rule out the diagnosis.
Patient was given morphine for air-hunger and continued on lasix drip for symptoms of heart failure.
# CORONARIES: No EKG changes consistent with acute ischemia.
No chest pain.
Troponin leak likely due to combination of demand ischemia and chronic kidney disease resulting in decreased troponin clearance.
# RHYTHM: Pt with first degree AV nodal block on EKG on admission.
Patient had short runs of unsustained VT (5-10 beats) few times daily.
# CKD: Cr.
Patient likely has pre-renal azotemia from heart failure complicated with underlying renal insuficiency from MM/Amyloid.
She was given morphine 0.5mg-2mg for SOB and air-hunger symptoms.
