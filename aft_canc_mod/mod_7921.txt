Compared to the previous tracing of [**2164-5-6**] there is no change.
[**2167-4-3**] CHEST XRAY: IMPRESSION: Chronic interstitial lung disease, most pronounced at the lung bases, similar to prior.
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality otherwise visualized.
Obstructive choledocholithiasis at the distal CBD resulting in severe intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
Mild infrarenal aortic ectasia.
Calcified pleural plaques with pulmonary fibrosis with lower lobe predominance, compatible with asbestosis.
Significant aortic calcification, but major intra-abdominal arteries are patent.
Large right exophytic renal cyst.
A moderate amount of semi solid food residue was noted in the stomach.
A mass was found at the duodenal bulb.
Due to duodenal deformity, we were unable to position the scope in front of the ampulla to attempt biliary cannulation.
Large capacity forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the mass in the duodenal bulb.
Mass in the duodenal bulb 7.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum  [**2167-4-5**] EKG: Normal sinus rhythm, rate 81, with ventricular synchronous pacing.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2167-4-3**] sinus tachycardia has given way to normal sinus rhythm and ventricular ectopy is new.
[**2167-4-6**]: ERCP: Impression: Small ulcer noted at the pylorus, which was stenotic but improved after dilation 2 days ago.
Mass in the duodenal bulb as seen previously - biopsies pending A single diverticulum with large opening was found at the major papilla.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome after a guidewire was placed.
A moderate diffuse dilation was seen at the biliary tree with the CBD measuring 18 mm.
Three round stones ranging in size from 8 mm to 12 mm that were causing partial obstruction were seen at the lower third of the common bile duct.
There was post-obstructive dilation.
4 large stones and biliary sludge were extracted successfully using a 15 mm balloon.
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a severe fixed inferior wall defect.
Gated images reveal mild global hypokinesis.
IMPRESSION: Severe fixed inferior wall defect.
Mild global hypokinesis.

[**2167-4-14**] IRN 1.5           Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service for evaluation and treatment of severe epigastric and chest pain.
On [**2167-4-4**] patient underwent ERCP which revealed a mass in the duodenal bulb, biopsy was taken.
On [**2167-4-6**] patient underwent repeat ERCP with extraction of the 4 large stones and biliary sludge.
On [**2167-4-8**], the patient underwent distal gastrectomy with Billroth II reconstruction and partial duodenectomy, and open cholecystectomy which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
After surgery patient was transferred into SICU NPO, on IV fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter, and IT Morphine for pain control.
Neuro: The patient received IT Morphine postoperatively with good effect and adequate pain control.
Patient's pain was well controlled during his hospital course.
Cardiac enzymes were sent and they were negative, hypotension was treated with IV fluid without pressors.
Pulmonary: Post op patient developed respiratory distress and was required CPAP.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating with assistance, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
