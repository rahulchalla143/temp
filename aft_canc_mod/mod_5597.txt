Pertinent Results: Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2138-2-19**]    PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION: Indication: Atrial fibrillation Height: (in) 63 Weight (lb): 145 BSA (m2): 1.69 m2 BP (mm Hg): 160/80 HR (bpm): 80 Status: Inpatient Date/Time: [**2138-2-19**] at 15:51 Test: TEE (Complete) Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler Contrast: None Tape Number: 2006W007-0:00 Test Location: West Cath/EP Lab Technical Quality: Adequate     REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 177**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.
Depressed LAA emptying velocity (<0.2m/s)  RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
AORTA: Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.
The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
Conclusions: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No intracardiac thrombus seen.
TECHNIQUE: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and Doppler ultrasound of bilateral lower extremities.
FINDINGS: Note is made of marked soft tissue swelling along the left inguinal to femoral area, with visually evident focal mass versus hernia or a large fluid collection, which somewhat limit the evaluation of the vessels.
Normal compressibility, flow, augmentations are seen in left common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins, no evidence of DVT.
Note is made of fluid collection in the inner thigh extending from the area of swelling.
No evidence of DVT.
Large grossly visible swelling versus mass along the left inguinal to femoral area, which may represent hernia, fluid collection, mass such as lipoma or hematoma if there is a recent iatrogenic intervention.
She was taken to the catheterization lab where she was found to have 3 vessel disease along with her known [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.6cm.
She also had a history of left subclavian stenosis for which she was stented on [**2138-2-4**].
An echocardiogram was performed which revealed severe Aortic stenosis, 3+ mitral regurgitation and an ejection fraction of 55%.
An intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram revealed severe aortic stenosis thus she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels and an aortic valve replacement using a 21mm [**Last Name (un) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial model 2800 bioprosthesis.
She remained intubated until POD 6, she underwent bronchoscopy on POD 4 to evacuate her left main bronchus of thick secretions.
On POD 6 she had a bedside swallow evaluation for possible aspiration with thin liquids.
Post operatively she developed atrial fibrillation for which she was placed on amiodarone and anticoagulation.
She developed a left lower extremity hematoma/seroma with bloody drainage from both of her leg incisions.
On POD11 She had a Left pleural effusion and underwent left thoracentesis for approx.
On POD 12 she underwent a TEE which did not show any evidence of left ventricular thrombus and subsequent D/C cardioversion.
She had bilateral venous doppler u/s of her lower extremities to assess for DVT which was negative.
On POD 16 she became hypotensive which failed to respond to fluid boluses.
An emergent abdominal CT scan showed a retropertoneal bleed.
This was attributed to having poor po intake with OHA.
On POD 21 Mrs. [**Known lastname 98282**] slipped on the bathroom floor and suffered a scalp hematoma with laceration.
A stat head CT was negative for intracranial hemorrhage and her physical exam was unremarkable for fracture or nuerologic insult.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
