There's been minimal cough, minimal sputum production, no hemoptysis, no wheezing, no orthopnea/pnd, no chest pain or palpitations, no uri sx.
The cancer is hormone refractory, and he was initially treated with lupron; when disease progression was demonstrated on this regimen, he underwent 28 cycles of taxotere/estramustine.
Most recently he's had taxotere and carboplatin for 12 cycles with good response though complicated by acute colitis.
Family History: His mother seems to have a malignancy but bx's have been unrevealing thus far.

[**2-1**] CXR: Subtle right lower lobe posterior basilar opacity, which may be due to atelectasis or early pneumonia.
Linear retrosternal upper lobe opacity, likely atelectasis.
New 2.0 x 1.3 cc cm focus of hypointensity in the right inferior frontal lobe.
[**2-2**] LENIs: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis.
Patchy bilateral ground-glass opacities, likely consistent with pulmonary edema from congestive heart failure.
[**2-2**] CXR: Interval worsening of multifocal bilateral hazy (ground glass) opacities, which is likely due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema or atypical infection.
Differential diagnosis includes hemorrhage and drug toxicity.
[**2-5**] Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a very small pericardial effusion (seen posteriorly).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**2-7**] CXR: No evidence of pneumothorax.
Slight worsening of parenchymal opacities.
[**2-7**] Bronchial Washings: negative for malignant cells.
There are diffuse ground glass opacities throughout both lung fields, most marked in the upper lobes.
There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
There are no effusions appreciated.
Bone windows reveal some rarified areas within scattered vertebral bodies raising the question of metastatic foci, unchanged compared to the prior exam.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are appreciated and appear new since the prior study.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Marked progression in diffuse ground glass infiltrates with relative sparing of the right lower lobe.
This is associated with development of new small bilateral effusions.
Study is otherwise unchanged including multiple areas within the thoracic vertebral body raising the question of bony involvement by this patient's underlying malignancy.
(Right upper lobe): a.  Patchy organizing pneumonitis with features of bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia (BOOP).
Marked accumulation of intraalveolar macrophages.
c.  Subpleural fibrosis with intimal thickening of pulmonary arteries.
(Right middle lobe): a.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with prostate origin, microscopic focus (slide G).
Tumor cells are positive for PSA and keratin cocktail and negative for PSAP, keratin 7 and 20. b.  Patchy organizing pneumonitis with features of bronchiolitis obliterated-organizing pneumonitis (BOOP).
c.  Marked accumulation of intraalveolar macrophages.
d.  Subpleural fibrosis with intimal thickening of pulmonary arteries.
Initial work up ruled out cardiac ischemia with a normal EKG and negative cardiac enzymes.
Initially, the patient was treated with levofloxacin for community acquired pneumonia.
When the patient continued to be febrile, ceftriaxone and azithromycin were started for community acquired pneumonia, and coverage was then broadened to zosyn and vancomycin to cover nosocomial pneumonia as the patient's infiltrates on chest xray were worsening while the patient was hospitalized.
A viral antigen screen was negative, ruling out influenza and several other viral infections.
The gram stain from the BAL showed no organisms, and the respiratory culture grew oropharyngeal flora.
However, the PCP screen in patients with malignancy is not always reliable, so bactrim and steroids were started to cover PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient was also continued on isolation precautions for TB until additional sputum samples could be obtained, for similar reasons.
The main concern, other than the above differential, was lymphangitic spread of his tumor, which could be confirmed with tissue, as well as BOOP, which was a concern given recent chemo therapy with tor-inhibitor, which has a known association with BOOP.
However pt had an episode of respiratory decompensation, requiring a transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and non-invasive ventilation with BiPAP.
was still very SOB, and the team was not confident that his SOB could be contributed to pulmonary edema and PE alone)  It was also noted that pt's decompensation happened after steroids were d/ced, and so a steroid responsive process like BOOP was considered.
Pathology showed BOOP + evidence of metastatic prostate CA in the lung.
In the end pt's SOB was felt to be multifactorial, from PE, lung mets from prostate CA, BOOP, which was most likely [**1-18**] pt's recent chemotherapy regimen, and from CHF with diastolic dysfunction.
A Renal US at that point showed no obstruction.
#CAD -- The patient was ruled out for MI on admission.
He was monitored on telemetry for a few days with no significant events.
#HTN -- We continued lisinopril, and doxazosin, which the patient was on as an outpatient, and added a beta blocker for better BP control, particularly given the patient's history of coronary artery disease.
There was no obvious source of blood loss or hemolysis.
The anemia was microcytic with a low retic count.
Laboratory studies were consistent with this etiology.
Improved with fluid restriction.
#Skin rash -- This was secondary to chemotherapy.
Celebrex was initially held due to elevated creatinine, but was restarted after a few days.
