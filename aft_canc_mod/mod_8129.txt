On arrival he was noted to have significant runs of NSVT (hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic but 40-50 beats at rate of approx 140 - given the slow rate his ICD did not fire) so cardiology and EP were consulted.
His coreg was transitioned to metoprolol at the recommendation of EP, and his electrolytes were optimized and his  and underwent anesthesia and an ERCP with brush biopsy of the stenotic-appearing ampulla with placement of a metal stent with resultant decrease in his bilirubin after discussion of the significant cardiac risks of the procedure with the pt.
He tolerated the procedure well and had moderate pain following, but his diet was advanced without difficulty.
His lasix and enalapril were held given relative hypotension on occasion.
His pain was largely controlled with very low and intermittant doses of morphine.
On [**9-18**] he began to have BRBPR, and by the morning his Hct had dropped to 27 from the mid 30s.
He underwent EGD on [**9-19**] that revealed an adherent clot in the duodenum but no active bleeding.
He continued to have episodes of melena and hematemesis suggesting ongoing bleeding and was transfused intermittently.
After a series of meetings with the patient and his family, it was decided that the patient would want angiography to treat his ongoing bleeding and then would prefer to be discharged home to enjoy the remainder of his time with his family.
The evening after angiography, the patient passed a small bloody bowel movement.
It was decided that the patient would like his GI bleeding addressed with angiography, but would not pursue surgery if angiography was unsuccessful.
He also did not wish to undergo an EUS/FNA to definitively diagnose his pancreatic head mass.
His antihypertensive medications were held on discharge and his digoxin dose was cut in half given his acute kidney injury.

You were treated with blood transfusions and an angio procedure where a small blood vessel was clipped.
The bleeding slowed down such that you are stable to go home.
