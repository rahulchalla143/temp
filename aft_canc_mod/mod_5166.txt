Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 77M with hx of DM, asthma, cervical spine fractures s/p fusion and repair, aspiration pneumonia s/p PEG placement, esophageal cancer presents with acute on chronic anemia .
Ct abdomen and chest were negative for acute bleeds and the pt was guaiac negative.
A CT neck was performed demonstrating that the hematoma on his neck had enlarged.
This was thus felt to be the most likely source of bleeding for the pt given the other negative findings/imaging.
However, by this time the pt's hct had stabilized and ortho felt no intervention was warranted.
A repeat b/l U/S demonstrated no presence of DVT on either side.
3) Metastatic esophageal cancer: The pt's esophageal cancer was not an active issue during this admission.
7) Stage 3 sacral decub: The pt was continued on vitamin C, zinc, and daily wound care and placed on an air mattress.
