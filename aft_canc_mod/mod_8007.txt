Was otherwise in USOH until earlier this week when developed "a cold", complaining of fever, congestion, and cough productive of "dark sputum."

A speech and swallow evaluation was concerning for esophageal dysphagia; since this was known to be old by his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
On admission, he was also found to have an NSTEMI with CKs peaking at [**2160**] in the setting of marked anterior ST depressions which subsequently improved; he was not heparinized due to his supratherapeutic INR, and he was loaded with clopidogrel.
A TTE showed a marked drop in his LVEF to 25% (from 71% on nuclear stress in [**10/2146**]) presumed secondary to ischemia.
In the setting of this NSTEMI and also due to clinical volume overload, he was diuresed with a series of Lasix boluses.
They also reviewed his cardiac cath report from [**1-/2148**] and recommended that he have a P-MIBI due to this new, large drop in his LVEF.
Per cardiology, even if he had a large reversible defect on his MIBI, his [**1-/2148**] cath report showed few (if any) options for potential further revascularization.
He was on home warfarin given his recent diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
On admission, however, he was noted to have a markedly elevated INR which was presumed to be due to his concurrent antibiotic use.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted to be in acute-on-chronic renal failure upon admission.
