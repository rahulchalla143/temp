Yesterday, she was getting up from bed and reaching for her walker, when she felt dizzy, stumbled and fell forward, striking her left forehead and left knee/hip.
No associated chest pain, shortness of breath, loss of bowel/bladder function.
Currently, she notes left hip/leg pain, worse with movement, [**1-23**], and a headache "all over my head" with tenderness over left frontal area.
The patient has a history of recurrent nausea/vomiting, attributed to achalasia and GERD, which has worsened recently.
She notes frequent nausea, without vomiting on a daily basis.
Its timing is not clearly associated with time of day or food, although she has noted decreased appetite/oral intake.
She has a chronic non-productive cough, no recent change.
She does note pleuritic central chest pain without SOB, which started this morning, intermittent, sharp.
The ICU was asked to evaluate the patient for placement of central line as no other access was available.
Shortly thereafter, the patient became tachycardic to 140's but not hypotensive.
At time of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] eval, the chest pain was absent and the patient cannot remember enough about it to describe it in more detail.
ROS: As above, in addition: No weight loss.
No fever, chills, night sweats, change in vision (legally blind), (+) mild rhinorrhea.
No sore throat.
(+) increase urinary frequency.

Compared to the prior stress echo report    ([**2197-5-15**]), mild fixed posterobasal defect is unchanged.

The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal akinesis of the distal inferior wall, distal anterior wall and apex.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild-moderate ([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (distal LAD lesion).
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
The hospitalist spoke with her gastroenterologist, who revealed that the patient has a history of fundic polyps with recurrent bleeding.
No active bleed.
# Hyponatremia: likely hypovolemic - GI bleed, poor PO intake, N/V.
#Troponin leak/NSTEMI: Developed tachycardia with ST segement depressions in V3-V6 in the setting of low HCT.
TnT peaked 0.77, with flat CKs and elevated MBs; likely demand ischemia in setting of active tachycardia and anemia.
Repeat TTE done, which showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (distal LAD lesion).
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Pt never developed chest pain or anginal sx.
Case discussed without patient cardiologist, who agreed with medical management as pt high risk for bleeding.
Acute Blood Loss Anemia 2.
