Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81 year-old man who has a known history of myelodysplastic syndrome.
He was originally hospitalized at an outside hospital after he presented with expressive aphagia on [**2170-9-24**] in the setting of profound thrombocytopenia.
The neurosurgery team felt he was not a good surgical candidate secondary to the size of his subdural hematoma as well as his thrombocytopenia.
The recommendations included to continue transfusing platelets to keep the platelet count greater then 100,000 and to continue his steroids to decrease cerebral edema and to aid the patient's response to the platelet transfusion and also to simply continue to monitor the patient's leukocytosis.
The initial feeling in the MICU was the patient may have a source of infection and the patient was continued on Ceftazidime one gram q 8 hours.
Throughout the course of the admission, however, no obvious source for infection was obtained (negative chest x-ray, negative urinalysis, negative blood cultures).
The patient's antibiotics were discontinued on hospital day number two after it was clear there was no infectious etiology for his leukocytosis.
He has been seen by physical therapy throughout the course of his hospitalization on the general medicine floor and the patient will be discharged to St. [**Known firstname 11042**] Hospital for short term rehabilitation.
The patient has remained afebrile for the last 48 prior to his discharge.
