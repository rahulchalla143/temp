She was discharged on Motrin for further pain control and returned on the morning of admission with worsening pain, vomiting and confusion.
In the emergency room, the patient had difficulty finding words.
The patient became more confusion after her sodium came up to 126, and a head CT was obtained showing a left temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage of 3 cm.
Abdomen:  Soft, non-tender and non-distended with positive bowel sounds.
The patient had a MRI scan which was positive for the intraparenchymal hemorrhage and possible metastatic tumor.
She was taken to the operating room on [**2103-3-8**] and had a left temporoparietal craniotomy for resection of the hemorrhagic lesion which was sent for pathology.
A repeat head CT on the 19th showed the left temporoparietal craniotomy with a hypo-dense area posterior to the bleed which was possibly consistent with edema.
