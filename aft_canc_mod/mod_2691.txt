RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY, WITHOUT CONTRAST:  PRELIMINARY WET [**Location (un) **]:  Please note that a wet [**Location (un) 1131**] was provided by the radiology resident on the PACS requisition as follows: "extensively comminuted tibial plateau fracture involving joint surface with hematoma and deep tissue air.
Comminuted proximal fibular fracture (spiral).
Discussed with trauma team (by resident [**Doctor Last Name **], M,"  FINAL REPORT:  There is a markedly comminuted fracture of the proximal tibia, extending into the tibial plateau, with considerable axial dispersion of the fracture fragments.
The distal major fracture lines exit in the medial and lateral metaphyses, with comminution.
The main longitudinal axis of the tibial shaft is displaced posteriorly with respect to the markedly comminuted proximal tibia, best appreciated on sagittal views.
There is also considerable comminution at the expected insertion site of the posterior cruciate ligament.
There is extensive surrounding soft tissue edema as well as some subcutaneous emphysema.
There is a comminuted fracture of the proximal diaphysis of the fibula.
Markedly comminuted and impacted fracture of the proximal tibia, with extensive involvement of the tibial plateau and posterior displacement of the main shaft of the tibia.
Proximal fibular diaphyseal fracture.
No comparison.
FINDINGS: Note is made of severe scoliosis, however, there is no gross fracture or dislocation.
No prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
No gross fracture or dislocation.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is a compression fracture of T4, with retropulsion of an inferior endplate fragment.
There appears to be only mild osseous encroachment on the canal, but the possibility of soft tissue abnormality, such as disk protusion or hematoma, cannot be evaluated.
He was emergently taken to the operating room on [**2152-6-12**] for incision and drainage of his right tibial plateau and spanning ex-fix.
He remained intubated secondary to his poor respiratory status.
On [**2152-6-14**] he was taken to the operating room for ORIF of his right acetabulum and R gamma nail.
On [**2152-6-16**] he was brought to the operating room for ORIF of his right tibial plateau.
The patient developed fevers in the TSICU.
On [**2152-6-26**] he was taken to the operating room with spine service for fixation of his sacral fractures and L4 fracture.
He received tranfusions for post-operative anemia and his electrolytes were repleted.
On [**2152-7-3**] he was brought to the operating room for revision of his right gamma nail and VAC placement of his [**Date Range **].
His hospital course was otherwise without incident.
