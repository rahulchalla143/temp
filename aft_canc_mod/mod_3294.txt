Admission Date:  [**2109-12-18**]     Discharge Date:  [**2110-1-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2054-4-22**]     Sex:  F  Service:  BMT  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 55-year-old female with a history of thyroid cancer, status post radioactive iodine therapy, who presented to her primary care physician several months ago with a history of easy bruisability.
Over the weekend, she developed a low grade temperature to 100.0, fever, cough and production of a green sputum.
On [**2109-12-16**], she was given the likely diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia based on those bone marrow biopsy results.
On review of systems, the patient reports no recent easy bruising.
She has had a good appetite, no dyspnea on exertion, no shortness of breath, no headache, no fevers, no upper respiratory infection symptoms, no gastrointestinal complaints, no nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, no bone pain, no joint pain, no pruritus, no vision changes, no hearing changes, no sinus problems.
She does use CPAP for obstructive sleep apnea secondary to vocal cord paralysis, but has stopped ten days ago because of concern about infection.
Obstructive sleep apnea secondary to vocal cord paralysis.

Neck - no lymphadenopathy, supple, no thyromegaly.
Heart - regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
No rales or rhonchi.
Extremities - thin, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Urinalysis negative, white blood cells five, red blood cells two, many bacteria on microscopy.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 55-year-old female with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia, who presents for induction chemotherapy.
Hematology/oncology - The patient presented with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia by bone marrow biopsy done prior to admission.
She presented with neutropenia and was maintained on neutropenic precautions for the entirety of her hospital stay.
She was anemic on admission and became thrombocytopenic shortly after the initiation of chemotherapy and required multiple transfusions throughout her hospital stay to address both her anemia and thrombocytopenia.
The patient tolerated induction chemotherapy well but subsequently developed febrile neutropenia and had a complicated course beyond that including extensive infectious disease workup with aggressive antibiotic coverage and subsequent development of respiratory failure in conjunction with high fevers and possible transfusion reaction resulting in capillary leak requiring Medical Intensive Care Unit stay for diuresis.
Transfusion medicine attending was consulted in regard to this respiratory failure to consider the possibility of transfusion related acute lung injury, which this patient had some features of but did not fully meet criteria for this disorder.
Subsequent day fourteen bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence of leukemia suggesting successful induction therapy.
During the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, she received multiple transfusions to address her anemia and thrombocytopenia as mentioned above.
Transfusions were held at this time for this reason and due to the patient's dramatic fevers to 105 degrees.
The pathology results did show no evidence of leukemia.
She remained afebrile until [**2109-12-29**], when she spiked a fever and was pancultured.
As fevers did recur, she was started on AmBisome for antifungal coverage.
On [**2110-1-3**], she continued to spike fevers, but had no localizing symptoms.
On [**2110-1-4**], fevers to 103 persisted and Cefepime was changed to Aztreonam for broad coverage.
Her fevers markedly increased despite change in medication and her Aztreanam was changed to Meropenem for gram positive gram negative anaerobic coverage in addition to Vancomycin and AmBisome.
On [**2110-1-6**], she spiked fevers to 105 degrees.
A CAT scan of the chest done on that day did reveal a right lower lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia.
The patient has slow improvement of her fever curve during her Intensive Care Unit stay and subsequent stay on the floor.
She did have persistent diarrhea and was suspected to be Clostridium difficile positive, however, this was not supported by stool studies.
Vascular access - On [**2110-12-19**], right subclavian Hickman line was placed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from the surgical service.
Endocrine - The patient was continued on Synthroid for history of hypothyroidism.
She was also continued on a proton pump inhibitor, Protonix, for prophylaxis.
She was noted to have transaminase elevation up to mid 300s for AST and ALT between [**2110-1-4**], and [**2110-1-12**].
Right upper quadrant ultrasound on [**2110-1-13**], showed a heterogeneous liver of nonspecific appearance.
The patient did develop diarrhea in the days leading up to discharge.
Clostridium difficile infection was suspected given the marked antibiotic administration.
Dermatology - The patient developed a rash during her chemotherapy course, but [**2109-12-26**], the dermatology team was consulted.
They suggested that her morbilliform eruption most likely represented hypersensitivity reaction, possibly from chemotherapy or perhaps Levofloxacin.
On [**2110-1-8**], the consultation service made further recommendations for Clobetasol for seven to ten days for ongoing rash and for Hydrocortisone 2.5% for the face, ears and other sensitive areas.
Prior to discharge, the patient had ongoing rash suspected to be related to Flagyl and therefore was transitioned to Vancomycin p.o.
for treatment of her suspected Clostridium difficile.
Respiratory - The patient had no respiratory issues early on in her hospital stay but on [**2110-1-6**], developed a new oxygen requirement in the setting of a new discovery of a right lower lobe pneumonia.
The patient developed significant hypoxia and ultimately respiratory failure on [**2110-1-7**], suspected to be due to worsening pneumonia and also possibly capillary leak in the setting of recent transfusion and possible transfusion reaction.
The bronchoscopy impression was that of pulmonary edema.
Transfusion related capillary leak was suspected and for the remainder of the patient's Intensive Care Unit stay, she was diuresed aggressively and had improving respiratory status.
On [**2110-1-10**], she was extubated without complication and she remained on three liters for several days and was slowly improved to adequate saturation in room air by [**2110-1-16**].
Cardiovascular - An echocardiogram of the heart was done on [**2110-1-8**], which showed an ejection fraction of greater than 75% and left ventricular systolic function was hyperdynamic, 1+ mitral regurgitation was observed, 1 to 2+ tricuspid regurgitation was observed, pulmonary artery systolic hypertension was noted, and a small pericardial effusion was seen.
The patient was noted to be mildly hypotensive prior to transition to the Intensive Care Unit but had no other hemodynamic instability during her hospital stay.
Acute myeloid leukemia.
Acute respiratory failure.
mouth pain times fourteen days.
Hickman flush once daily, flush with 3ml normal saline and 3ml 100 units Heparin, change dressing every seven days and more frequently if becomes nonocclusive.
The patient was discharged with VNA services to provide Hickman care and monitoring of her respiratory status and to monitor for fever and signs of infection.
