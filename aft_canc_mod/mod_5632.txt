Admission Date:  [**2164-6-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-6-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2088-9-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Keflex / Lisinopril / Amiodarone / Percocet / Flecainide  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**] Chief Complaint: hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pulmonary Vein Isolation Ablation   History of Present Illness: Patient is a 75 year old woman with PMHx monomorphic VT arrest while on Flecainide, CAD s/p mid RCA and proximal LAD stenting in [**2157**], paroxysmal atrial fibrillation previously treated with Sotalol, Flecainide, Amiodarone and dronedarone who comes to the CCU after becoming hypotensive and 1 pressor dependent after a PVI.
The patient was previously treated with multiple agents for her A fib, most recently amiodarone which was d/c'd due to concern over pulmonary toxicity and dronedarone which was stopped in advance of the PVI.
She also underwent a TEE/DC Cardioversion on [**2164-3-26**], however reverted back to atrial fibrillation within a few weeks of the cardioversion.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, syncope or presyncope.

ECG: [**6-26**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Modest ST-T wave changes are non-specific.
Since the previous tracing of the same date the QTc interval appears shorter but there may be no significant change  [**6-26**]: Atrial fibrillation.
Since the previous tracing of [**2164-6-19**] probably no significant change  [**6-27**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Delayed R wave progression with late precordial QRS transition.
Since the previous tracing of [**2164-6-26**] no significant change.
[**6-27**]: Sinus rhythm with a single ventricular premature beat.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2164-6-27**] atrial fibrillation is no longer present  [**6-28**]: Sinus rhythm.
Poor R wave progression is likely a normal variant but consider prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2164-6-28**] no diagnostic interim change  [**6-28**]: Sinus rhythm.
Compared to tracing #1 ventricular premature beat is no longer present  Echo: PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad  CXR [**6-28**]: Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2163-2-15**].
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, but there is slight interval progression of interstitial opacities, finding that might represent interstitial pulmonary edema that has developed.
Repeated radiograph after diuresis, preferably in PA and lateral upright technique is recommended for precise characterization of the mediastinum and documentation of resolution of mild pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 75 y/o female with PMHx monomorphic VT arrest while on Flecainide, CAD s/p mid RCA and proximal LAD stenting in [**2157**], paroxysmal atrial fibrillation previously treated with Sotalol, Flecainide, Amiodarone and dronedarone who comes to the CCU after becoming hypotensive and 1 pressor dependent after a PVI.
# Hypotension - The patient underwent a PVI, afterwards which she developed hypotension and required dopamine to maintain her pressures.
Her pressure was maintained without need for pressors or IVF.
# Atrial fibrillation - She remained in atrial fibriallation after her PVI.
After the first day, her QT interval was noted to have elongated slightly.
# Hypertension - The patient was restarted on her valsartan but at a lower dose of 80mg.
The patient did have one episode of hypoxia overnight after she got up to use the bathroom.
Her EKG showed no changes, a CXR showed pulmonary edema.
It was thought the patient had flash pulmonary edema.
Her shortness of breath resolved and she was comfortable lying in bed.
# UA - The patient complained of dysuria on one occasion.
Her dipsticks showed no signs of infection.
She was instructed to call her PCP if she developed UTI symptoms.
