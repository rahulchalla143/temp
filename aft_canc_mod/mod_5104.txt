A recent echocardiogram in [**Month (only) **] revealed severe MR with a flail posterior leaflet.
He was admitted to the VA and underwent a TEE which was stopped due to NSVT vs. SVT.
Cardiac catheterization  in [**2162-1-17**] confirmed 4+ MR. Angiography revealed a 70% lesion in the circumflex and a 50% lesion in the LAD.
Mr. [**Known lastname 1617**] was seen in clinic and now presents for surgical management of his coronary artery disease and mitral regurgitation.

The operation was uneventful but his operative course was complicated by traumatic foley placement secondary to his BPH.
Given his history of SVT and Maze procedure, Amiodarone was resumed.
On postoperative day five, he experienced new onset slurred speech and left facial droop.
Head MR found no evidence of acute infarction or abnormalities except slightly diminished flow signal within the right Sylvian middle cerebral artery branches compared to the left side,  while CT scan showed no intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Carotid noninvasive studies found no evidence of significant carotid stenoses and showed appropriate antegrade flow in the vertebral arteries.
Based on the above studies, the neurology service suspected a TIA secondary to decreased cerebral perfusion.
He remained mostly in a normal sinus rhythm but intermittent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation versus SVT were noted on telemetry.
His oxygen sat was 98% on room air and his chest x-ray showed small bilateral pleural effusions.
He was voiding without difficulty and his hematuria had completely resolved.
