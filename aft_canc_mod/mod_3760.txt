Of note, the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital3 20445**] on [**2136-7-2**] for lower extremity cellulitis with cultures positive for pansensitive Pseudomonas, was just treated with ciprofloxacin and Zosyn.
The course was complicated by Clostridium difficile, for which the patient was treated with Flagyl as well as acute renal failure, which was attributed to mild ATN and prerenal azotemia.
On [**2136-7-12**], the patient was noted to have bandemia and elevated BNP.
The patient was treated with dopamine, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, levofloxacin, Flagyl but became progressively hypertensive and dyspneic despite Levophed, dobutamine, BiPAP.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Right ventricular heart failure secondary to anthracycline toxicity.
Mitral valve prolapse.
Acute renal failure.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies cigarettes or alcohol.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS ON TRANSFER TO [**Hospital1 18**]:  Her constitutional symptoms were abnormal.
She had abdominal pain.
She complained of dyspnea on exertion.
She complained of dyspnea with lying flat and orthopnea, and complained of edema.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  She was somnolent but arousable, cachetic and frail, in no apparent distress.
Chest:  With diminished breath sounds in anterior lower one half of her lung fields bilaterally with no rales bilaterally.
She had poor aeration overall.
Cardiovascular:  Irregular regular rate in 120s with normal S1, S2 with no audible murmur, rubs or gallop.
Abdomen:  With diffuse anasarca with pitting edema in the back and abdomen.
Abdomen was nontender, nondistended, no masses were appreciable.
Extremities:  Lower extremity ulcers at shins bilaterally with granulomatous tissue with some surrounding erythema.
No focal deficits.
RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  EKG on [**2136-7-15**] at 4 a.m. showed a rate of 118 beats per minute, regular, without obvious P waves, QRS 100 msec, question severe right axis deviation versus left axis deviation, possible lead reversal.
Her chest x-ray preliminary showed bilateral pleural effusions consistent with CHF.
ASSESSMENT:  A 78-year-old female who was transferred from outside hospital at 4 a.m. with hypertension, hypoxia, tachycardia, anasarca in the setting of CLL, anthracycline- induced cardiomyopathy, recent lower extremity pseudomonal infection, recent Clostridium difficile infection, acute renal failure, pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusions, thrombocytopenia, elevated INR of 1.6.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This patient appeared on transfer to be in shock likely secondary to sepsis in origin though also possibility of cardiogenic shock as well.
In any case, the patient clearly was in multiorgan system failure despite pressors and broad spectrum antibiotics, and her prognosis at the time of transfer appeared grim.
