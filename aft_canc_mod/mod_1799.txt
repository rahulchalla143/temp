He was taken to the OR on [**8-7**] by Drs [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who performed an orthotopic liver transplant with duct-to-duct anastomosis.
This was possibly a technical difficulty due to large abdominal size.
There was some concern due to velocities in the main portal vein ranging from 109 to 149 cm/sec, which was similar to the previous study.
An MR was initially suggestive of a Portal Vein stenosis and the patient was initiated on a heparin drip.
Portal venography was performed on [**8-15**] showing discrepancy in size between the native and donor portal veins with relative stenosis, but no significant pressure gradient across the anastomosis.
The patient had one remaining JP at the time of this test which was putting out about 1-1.2 liters of ascitic fluid tinged with bile daily.
Liver enzymes (AST and ALT) which had briefly elevated at the time of the portal venography trended back to normal.
Alk phos remained slightly elevated in addition to serum bilirubin of 5.9.
On [**8-19**], an ERCP was performed for concern for bile leak as the JP bili was 25.7.
This revealed biliary narrowing at the site of duct to duct anastomosis.
A CT without iv contrast was performed on [**8-20**] to assess for a perihepatic collection.
A collection was noted and this was drained in CT for 260cc of serosanguinous fluid.
On [**8-17**] (pod 9), the apex area of the incision was opened due to inadequete approximation of the incision and fluid noted at the site.
He did well with insulin teaching and experienced no low blood sugars.
