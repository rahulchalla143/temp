There is no hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of midline structures, or evidence of major vascular territorial infarction.
There is mild right maxillary sinus mucosal thickening (3:2).
No hemorrhage or mass effect.
MRI w/ gadolinium recommended to evaluate for tumor recurrence.
# CXR [**2161-2-13**]: (prelim) no acute cardiopulmonary process # MRI spine [**2161-2-15**]: Evaluation of the cervical spine demonstrates no evidence for osseous metastatic disease.
Multilevel spondylosis is seen including a disc osteophyte complex at C5/C6 and C6/C7.
There is also a left paracentral disc protrusion which is broad-based at C6/C7 extending into the foramen.
There is moderate stenosis at these two levels.
There is a small nonspecific lesion in the right thyroid lobe measuring approximately 7 mm.
There is no epidural disease seen.
Evaluation of the thoracic and lumbar spine demonstrates mild marrow hypointensity.
There is high signal within the sacrum which may be related to prior radiation to the rectum.
No convincing evidence for epidural or intradural metastatic disease is seen.
There is a central to left paracentral disc protrusion at L4-L5 causing left lateral recess narrowing and then abutting the left L5 nerve root.
There is heterogeneous appearance to the iliac wings bilaterally which again may be related to prior radiation.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for metastatic disease.
The electrophysiologic abnormalities are most consistent with a moderate generalized neuropathy with demyelinating and axonal features.
Given the time course of progression, the findings are consistent with an acquired neuropathy such as [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 7816**] [**Location (un) **] syndrome.
New DVT in the R common iliac v, appears to emanating from the R internal iliac v. The thrombosis extends to near the confluence of the common iliac.
Recommend urgent DVT ultrasound in the lower extremities.
Interval decrease of lung disease burden.
Post-radiation changes in the perirectal region.
No bowel obstruction.
Brief Hospital Course: 56M with rectal carcinoma s/p resection, chemoradiation who was referred to ED for R common iliac DVT and was found to be febrile.
He was treated with Lovenox, empiric antibiotics, however developed progressive weakness initially concerning for spinal cord compression (MRI pan spine showed no cord compression, while MRI of head showed a stable cerebellar herniation through craniotomy site without evidence of infection).
His exam progressed to bilateral leg weakness, worsened bilateral hand and lower leg numbness, tongue numbness, and dysphagia to liquids and solids and patient developed progressive loss of reflexes.
# GBS Patient with ascending weakness, loss of reflexes and CSF with albuninocytologic dissociation.
His NIF and vital capacity apparently declined while in medical ICU and he was intubated on [**2161-2-20**] based on above and in setting of tachypnea.
His strength slowly improved, however there remained mild assymetry of L > R weakness (including face) as well as more proximal vs. distal weakness.
# Weakness and parathesias: Overnight [**2-14**] patient developed neurologic sxs concerning for cord compression of the low cervical or high thoracic vertabrae, however normal spinal MRI without compression.
[**Month (only) 116**] also be complicated by cerebellar mets and chemo induced neuropathy.
Also on [**2-18**] the patient developed dyspnea with a RR to the low 20s and maintance of oxygen saturation in the 90s on RA.
He developed urinary retention (bladder scan with 500cc) though also may have been holding in his urine due to physical difficulty using urinal.
On [**2-18**] the patient had an IR guided LP revealing elevated protein with 1 WBCs.
A diagnosis of GBS was made based on progressive weakness and loss of reflexes (see above for GBS management).
# DVT: R common iliac thrombus seen on outpatient CT. LENIS showed no lower clot.
# Fever: Given recent chemotherapy, was initially concerning for infection.
Bandemia reflects recent Neulasta administration.
No evidence of sepsis.
Fever might also be related to DVT or chemo itself.
He continued to have intermittent low grade fevers (101F) which were attributed to DVT.
# elevated blood glucose: Hemoglobin A1C of 6.5 suggests glucose intolerance.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray [**Hospital1 **]: [**1-10**] Sprays Nasal QID (4 times a day) as needed for dry nose.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet [**Month/Day (2) **]: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Acetaminophen 650 mg Tablet [**Month/Day (2) **]: One (1) Tablet PO every four (4) hours as needed for fever or pain.
Discharge Condition: Mental status - intact Strength - diffusely weak, distal > proximal.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with a clot in your left leg and fevers.
You were evaluated for multiple causes of the fever, but they were negative.
You also developed progressive weakness in your arms and legs, and difficulty swallowing, and were diagnosed with [**Last Name (un) 30836**] [**Location (un) **] syndrome (also known by the acronym AIDP).
Your weakness improved somewhat, but will likely require several weeks (perhaps as long as 12 weeks) to return to normal.
In addition, while at the hospital, you were found to have signficantly elevated blood sugars.
This may be related to stress or an underlying early diabetes.
Should you develop any symptoms concerning to you or some of the listed below, please call your doctor or go to the emergency room.
