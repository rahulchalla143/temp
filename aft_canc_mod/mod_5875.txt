HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer to bone and brain, who was noted to be sluggish with change in mental status by the [**Hospital6 **] and by the family.
He denied any shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
He was seen in the Hematology/[**Hospital **] Clinic three days prior to admission and at that time it was noted that he had difficulty concentrating and processing information.
During that visit, he was also started on ketoconazole and hydrocortisone for his metastatic prostate cancer.
He had a CT angiogram of his chest, which showed very large bilateral pulmonary emboli.
He had MRI of the head, which showed a new dural brain metastases and a question of surrounding bleeding.
Prostate cancer diagnosed about [**2149**].
In [**2164-3-16**], the patient was found to have metastatic disease to his jaw and scheduled to start radiation on [**2164-4-17**].
History of DVT in [**2147**], as well as on [**12-16**], at which time he had an IVC filter placed.
History of atrial fibrillation, now in normal sinus on Quinidine and Digoxin.
History of right-sided pneumonia.
Oropharynx clear, no lymphadenopathy.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, grade 2 out of 6 holosystolic murmur at the left upper sternal border and [**2-22**] murmur at the right upper sternal border.
Respiratory crackles at the right base.
ABDOMEN:  Abdomen was nontender and nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  1+ edema bilaterally.
Urinalysis negative.
No ST or T wave changes.
Chest x-ray showed possible left lower lobe infiltrate.
Findings on the MRI showed a new focus dural-based tumor 1  x 1.5 cm in the right parietal region with similar contrast to the original right temporal-dural based tumor, which was resected.
There is a solitary punctate region of restrictive diffusion in the right parietal cortex, which could represent a minute area of ischemia and signs of chronic microvascular infarction in the cerebellum.
The patient also had a CT of the head, which showed status post craniotomy and tumor resection, methacrylate prosthesis and surgical changes, hyperdense enhancing foci anterior to the right frontal lobe and right occipital lobe concerning for a small foci of hemorrhage or tumor; MRI followed that CT scan.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  PULMONARY:  The patient was admitted with a very massive pulmonary emboli.
Due to his malignancy there was concern regarding starting of anticoagulation.
He was seen by the Department of Neurological Oncology, who has been following him and who reviewed the imaging studies.
It was thought to be consistent with a new dural metastases and bleed in the dura or brain parenchyma.
Heparin was then discontinued after the patient suffered intracranial bleeding as noted below.
It was thought that may be this was chronic in nature and the Department of Radiology could not determine whether it was acute or chronic.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] discussed the case with the Department of Vascular Surgery, who did not feel a surgical resection of the PE was appropriate at this time.
NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient was admitted with delta MS thought to be secondary to his hypoxia from the PE and possibly from new or old brain metastases.
He was noted over the 5th and 6th to have a decline in his mental status with word-finding difficulties and some visual changes.
He was also noted to have spiking temperatures.
This showed a large occipital bleed about 5 cm in size.
At the time of discharge, the patient continued to have word-finding difficulties, as well as left-sided visual deficits and neglect.
He needs assistance with all activities secondary to these defects.
This showed slowing over the right hemisphere suggesting damage or dysfunction of the cortical matter on the right and widespread mild encephalopathy, no epileptic forms were seen.
The patient remains mildly confused, but his primary neurological symptoms is difficulty speaking.
He was complaining of some difficulty swallowing, which was evaluated by a video speak, and swallow study and the patient passed this.
He is not at risk for aspiration.
He started with his XRT for his new mandible metastases on the third.
The patient developed low-grade temperatures on [**2164-4-20**].
Chest x-ray showed no evidence of infiltrate.
He was started on Levofloxacin on his admission to the hospital over concerns of pneumonia and that was continued through the 11th.
He has no localizing signs of infection and abnormal WBC at the time of discharge.
Suspicion for bacterial meningitis was very low and given his intracranial bleed, LP was not performed during this admission.
The patient should be given Tylenol for fevers and results of cultures should be followed by the physician at rehabilitation and the oncologist.
Metastatic prostate cancer.
Large bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Large occipital bleed.
Atrial fibrillation.
Please note:  Addendum to the above:  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient's fevers, at the time of discharge, were thought to either be secondary to drugs or more likely secondary to resolution and reabsorption of the bleeding inside the patient's head.
This was discussed with the Department of Neurosurgery and it is possible to have low-grade temperature secondary to the bleeding, although it is more common in the first few days status post bleed.
Fevers should be followed and discussed with the patient's physician before returning him to the hospital for fever workup.
