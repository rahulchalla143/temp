Admission Date:  [**2101-5-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-5-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2030-3-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2090**] Chief Complaint: transferred from OSH s/p GTC   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: endotracheal intubation flouroscopic guided LP   History of Present Illness: 71yo RH F h/o lung cancer diagnosed [**1-16**] metastatic to her kidney and adrenal gland on chemotherapy (agents unknown), who over the past couple of days has been having decreased PO intake and was seen by her family to have a "feeble, shuffling" gait and was slow to respond to questions, such as what she wanted for breakfast.
Her eyes then rolled back, all limbs tonically extended and then both arms shook repeatedly and her head turned purplish, with frothing at the mouth and she did not respond to her family.
Family History: mother died of lung cancer (non-smoker)   Physical Exam: Admission PE VS 98.7 92 28 162/94 98% 2L Gen Lying in bed in NAD Neck supple CV rrr no bruits Pulm ctab Abd soft benign Ext no edema .
CN III, IV, VI: EOMI no nystagmus CN V: b/l corneal reflexes and symmetric grimace to nasal tickle CN VII: full facial symmetry CN IX, X: cough to ET tube manipulation .
No seizure activity is apparent at this time .
EEG: ABNORMALITY #1: Persistent left centroparietal theta slowing was noted in the drowsy and sleeping states.
HYPERVENTILATION: Contraindicated due to patient's mental status.
SLEEP: The patient remained in either stage I or II sleep throughout the recording.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG in the drowsy and sleeping states due to the persistent left centroparietal theta slowing, suggesting a focal region of subcortical dysfunction.
No epileptiform features were noted.
Head CT:   Marked atrophy and right temporal lobe encephalomalacia, which may be a substrate for seizure, but no evidence of acute intracranial process.
Within these limitations, there is no evidence of large mass or acute infarct.
MRI Head [**5-20**]: Again an area of encephalomalacia is identified in the right parietotemporal region.
Moderate-to-severe brain atrophy is seen.
There is no midline shift identified or hydrocephalus seen.
No acute infarct on diffusion images seen although the images are somewhat limited by motion.
Again encephalomalacia in the right temporoparietal region and brain atrophy are noted as seen on the recent MRI of [**2101-5-19**].
CT Head With and Without Contrast, [**5-22**]: HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Compared with the prior exams, there has been no interval change.
There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures.
There is persistent encephalomalacia in the right parietotemporal region, consistent with old infarction.
Again seen is moderate-to-severe brain atrophy with prominence of the ventricles and sulci.
Again noted an air-fluid level in the left sphenoid sinus.
HEAD CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  No enhancing lesions are seen on the contrast-enhanced images.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of enhancing lesion.
CSF Cytology: Negative for malignant cells .
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler (cannot definitively exclude).
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal inferior hypokinesis).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Bone Scan: INTERPRETATION:   Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior a and posterior projections.
There are several foci of abnormal tracer localization that could potentially correspond to osseous metastases.
There is intense tracer uptake at the head of the right clavicle.
Mild-to-moderate intensity uptake is present in the right 3rd and left 7th ribs.
The pattern of intense uptake in the sacrum is an almost H-shaped configuration that is typical for insufficiency fracture.
The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer excretion.
There are no prior studies available for comparison.
No correlative anatomic imaging is available at the time of this study.
IMPRESSION: 1) Uptake abnormalities at right clavicular head and a couple of ribs are concerning for osseous metastases; however, fractures are also a possibility.
These areas can be correlated with anatomic imaging.
2) Pattern of intense sacral uptake is most suggestive of insufficiency fracture.
Hip X-Ray: Three radiographs of the left hip demonstrate no fracture.
Bilateral femoral head contours are smooth.
Nonspecific soft tissue calcification projects over the left lateral buttock.
Bilateral sacroiliac joint spaces and the pubic symphysis are unremarkable.
Degenerative changes involving the lumbosacral spine are incompletely assessed on these pelvic and hip radiographs.
Nonspecific soft tissue calcification projecting over the left lateral buttock.
Differential diagnosis is broad, but would include dystrophic calcification within the regional fat.
If available, comparison with previous radiographs would help to better assess for interval change.
EEG was performed (see results above) and showed R centroparietal theta slowing but no epileptiform discharges.
Head CT was negative for evidence of metastatic lesions or mass.
She had no further seizures in house.
On the floor, MRI was pursued to rule out metastatic lesion.
A CT with contrast was therefore performed and showed no evidence of metastatic disease as a possible seizure focus.
This showed no evidence of metastatic disease, 0 WBCs, 0 RBCs, protein 50, glucose 64.
We therefore felt that the most likely cause of her seizure was hyponatremia, as work up for a structural cause was negative.
We did not feel that she would benefit from an AED given that she had identified no structural focus.
A bone scan was performed (see results above) and did show evidence of bony mets.
had pain in her left lower back while in house (which contributed to her not being able to tolerate MRI).
The pain was felt to be musculoskeletal and responded to a Lidocaine patch and around the clock Tylenol.
Medications on Admission: Lorazepam PRN Cyclobenzaprine, tylenol PRN for back pain (no known bony mets) Citalopram Quetiapine   Discharge Medications: 1.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 533**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for Extended Care - [**Location 1268**]  Discharge Diagnosis: hyponatremia s/p generalized tonic clonic seizure, due to hyponatremia metastatic lung cancer   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Take all medications as prescribed.
Call your doctor or return to the hospital if you have any more seizures, fevers, chills, or any other concerning symptoms.
