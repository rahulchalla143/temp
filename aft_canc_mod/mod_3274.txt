[**Last Name (STitle) **].
[**Doctor Last Name **]/cma&#8222;  DIAGNOSIS  Aortic valve leaflets:  Extensive calcifications and focal chronic inflammation.
[**2150-1-27**] Compared to [**2150-1-24**], the overall appearance of the lungs and pleural spaces is unchanged.
The pleural fluid anteriorly in the right chest and the lateral pleural fluid/thickening raises the question of loculation to a small degree, though there appears to be persistent subpulmonic effusion making up the majority of the right effusion.
Atelectasis at the right lung base and mid lung persists.
There is a trace left pleural effusion and minimal left lung subsegmental atelectasis.
2.3 cm oval radiopaque lesion overlying the right inferior aspect of the liver is uncertain in location but also appeared to be present on the [**2150-1-24**] chest film and could represent a gallstone, though this is uncertain.
Unchanged appearance of the lungs and pleural spaces with complicated right pleural fluid, which could represent resolving hemothorax.
Nondependent portions of the collection raise question of small loculations, unchanged.
This is uncertain whether it is within the patient and would likely represent a gallstone, or external to the patient.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the LA.
Dynamic interatrial septum.
No ASD or PFO by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity.
Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Mildly dilated descending aorta.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Right ventricular systolic function is mildly hypokinetic.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: As mentioned in the HPI Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a cardiac cath which revealed severe AS, native CAD with clean bypass grafts.
Chest x-ray revealed small right apical PTX which slowly decreased in size throughout hospital course.
Once extubated she appeared to have some delirium which slowly improved over time with medication.
Her WBC remained elevated throughout hospital course (secondary to CML) but multiple blood and urine cultures were performed to r/o infection.
She remained stable over next several days and then had an episode of atrial fibrillation on post-op day seven which was successfully converted to SR with Lopressor.
