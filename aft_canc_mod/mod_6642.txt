Per report, pt noticed clogging, cloudy outpt from his urostomy tubes 1-2 days ago and 1 episode of vomiting.
He also reportedly denied change in ileostomy outpt, but was noted to have cloudy outpt from his R.nephrostomy tube.
The patient's abdomen was non-tender, non-distended, and had b/l nephrostomy tubes with cloudy/turbid outpt.
As the patient is now stable with a diagnosis of urosepsis, organism to be determined he is called out to the medical floor.
Chronic pain GERD   Social History: Pt lives in [**Location **], formerly lived in Hospice facility.
Sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing there is no significant change.
There is an 8 mm right thyroid lobe nodule.
The patient LUL collapse with a left hilar mass.
There are multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, consistent with known history of malignancy, metastatic lung cancer.
Evaluation of hilar structures is limited given lack of IV contrast, however, there is fullness adjacent to the left upper lobe bronchus with suggestion of a mass measuring 1.9 x 2.6 cm, may relate to patient's known malignancy (2:19).
There are bilateral pleural effusions.
There is right lower lobe consolidation may reflect atelectasis given enhancement.
The right adrenal demonstrates a mass, measuring 2.1 x 1.6 cm, suspicious for adrenal metastases.
There are multiple mesenteric lymph nodes, in the gastrosplenic ligament, measuring up to 1.2 cm and may reflect metastatic nodes.
The patient has an indwelling vena caval filter.
The leftkidney demonstrates mild hydronephrosis and hydroureter, could be due to clogged PCN tube, which is appropriately positioned in the renal pelvis.
There is no intraperitoneal free fluid or free air.
There is a left paramedian colostomy.
There is a right lower quadrant ileostomy.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is marked soft tissue thickening and fullness in the deep pelvis effacing the normal fat planes and limiting differentiation between bladder, prostate and residual rectum.
There is no inguinal or pelvicsidewall adenopathy.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no osteolytic or osteosclerotic lesions.
Innumerable pulmonary nodules, right adrenal metastases, mesenteric nodes, pelvic soft tissue mass, left peri hilar mass, and left upper lobe collapse, findings consistent with metastatic lung cancer.
A hydronephrotic left kidney with percutaneous nephrostomy tube in situ and moderate left hydronephrosis and hydroureter possibly due to  compression/infiltration from the pelvic mass and clogged PCN tube.
Bilateral Pleural effusions and RLL atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: Pt is a 51 y.o male with h.o colon ca who presents with hypotension found to have sepsis due to UTI.
The patient had a positive urinanalysis and urine cultures revealed Pseudomonas growing in both of his nephrostomy tubes which is sensitive to Cefepime.
While on the floors the patient was normotensive and afebrile without any complaints of shortness of breath, fevers, chills, or abdominal pain.
The patient had bouts of tachycardia to 120s during his stay on the floors which responded to high 90s with fluid boluses.
He did not have any episodes of hypoxia, hemoptysis or chest pain concerning for PE.
His pain was well controlled.
Of note, the patient says that he has a baseline tachycardia.
Metastatic colon cancer: A CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed extensive metastases.
The patient is s/p bowel resections with a colostomy, stoma and bilateral nephrostomies.
The patient stated that he is full code and wants chemotherapy for his disease.
It might have been leaking secondary to either kinking or increased debris.
Anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency anemia: The patient remains and lab values reveal an anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency anemia.
The use needs to be addressed for its immunosuppressive effects, especially in light of his recent infection.
Address goals of care for his metastatic cancer.
Acetaminophen 650 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6HR:PRN as needed for fever or pain: Do not exceed 4 grams per day.
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO q4HR: PRN as needed for anxiety.
Roxanol Concentrate 20 mg/mL Solution Sig: 4.5 mL PO Q2HR:PRN as needed for pain: Sublingually.

Sepsis due to UTI .
Metastatic colon cancer 2.
Anemia   Discharge Condition: Stable.

You were found to have an infection with bacteria called Pseudomonas growing in your urine.
While on the general medicine floors, you did not have a fever or low blood pressure.
It was probably leaking due to a kink in the tube.
