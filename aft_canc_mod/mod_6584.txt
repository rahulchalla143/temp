Large pelvic mass with rounded components within it certainly could represent a fibroid uterus although the differential includes malignant etiologies such as uterine sarcoma or spindle cell lesion.
Left renal infarcts (less likley pyelonephritis)  Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2148-3-11**] at 3:00:55 PM      FINAL Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Large pelvic mass with rounded components likely representing a fibroid uterus, although the differential includes malignant etiology such as uterine sarcoma as well, unchanged.
Multiple pulmonary emboli as described above.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2148-3-12**] no diagnostic interval change except for slowing of the rate.
[**Doctor Last Name 9885**] reads as follows: "Fibrin admixed with inflammatory cells, and degenerative cellular debris and cluster of atypical epithelioid cells.
It consists of a uterus with detached cervix and without attached adnexae.
Cannot differentiate from posterior and anterior surfaces due to marked distortion.
The serosa is smooth, except for subserosal leiomyoma and adnexal resection margins.
No other masses or lesions are seen in the endometrium.
The largest leiomyoma is sectioned to reveal whorled cut surfaces without hemorrhage or necrosis.
Gross diagnosis by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] reads as follows:  "Endometrium with two submucosal leiomyomas, myometrium with numerous leiomyomas without gross hemorrhage or necrosis, final diagnosis pending permanent sections".
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
There appears to by a moble hypoechoic mass attached to the lumen of the descending thoracic aorta at the level of the kidneys which could represent a clot or tumor.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 3/14/09/Admitted w/ Lt CFV DVT and likely aortic thrombus in the setting of large pelvic mass.
CT pelvis/abd- large pelvic mass, L CFV thrombosis, L renal infarcts.
Repeated CT pelvis w/&w/o con- same large pelvic mass, clot identified in the descending aorta, multiple pulmonar emboli, multiple renal infarcts.
Pre-op for IVC filter placement.
Taken to OR for dual Vascular and Gyn surgery (Aortic thrombectomy/endarterectomy and hysterectomy).
Placed on Nitro drip for BP control, given Fentanyl for pain control.
3/20-21/09 POD1-2 Remains in the CVICU, still on Nitro drip for BP control, recieving Fentanyl boluses for pain control.
[**2148-3-18**] POD4 No acute events.
