There is surrounding FLAIR hyperintense edema and there is depression of the body and frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle without significant rightward shift of midline structures.
There is some effacement of the left frontal sulci.
There are other areas of patchy FLAIR hyperintensity in the cerebral white matter, but no underlying enhancing lesion is seen elsewhere.
Posterior to the dens, there is low signal intensity material extending superiorly, along the posterior margin of the clivus, indenting the cervicomedullary junction without edema in the medulla or spinal cord.
The appearance of this low signal intensity material and the thick adjacent dural enhancement suggests a heavily calcified meningioma.
The lesion is of increased density on the CT that was obtained as a part of the PET scan on [**2130-3-15**].
It does not appear to have significantly changed in size.
There is an approximately 5-cm left frontal mass with some mass effect on the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
It could be related to the patient's lymphoma or could be another malignancy such as a glioblastoma.
There is an anterior extra-axial mass associated with the dens and clivus with thick adjacent dural enhancement almost certainly a meningioma.
There is a mild compression of the cervicomedullary junction.
He was evaluated for his altered mental status and brain lesion.
