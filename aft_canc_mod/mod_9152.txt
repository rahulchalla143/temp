At this time we were suspicious that she may have some hematoma underneath her wound and we conceded that her wound was going to breakdown.
At this time her staples were removed from the knee to the groin and her wound partially dehisced.
At this time a large amount in excess of 100 cc of old hematoma was expressed through the wound and the open edges were packed with normal saline wet to dry gauze and covered in ABd pads.
It was originally felt that this was due to liquefaction of old hematoma and a pressure dressing was applied.
On [**2195-4-10**] the patient's 15th postoperative day, she was taken to the operating room for exploration of her wound hematoma and presumed infection.
There she had evacuation of her hematoma and debridement of the wound edges.
During the operation the patient's vein graft was found to have a small pin hole leak which was subsequently repaired.
Cultures at the time of the operation grew methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus and two different species of carinii bacterium.
In addition to her wound complication the patient had some difficulty with constipation around the time of her two week postoperative period she had very poor po intake and felt extremely nauseous.
The patient achieved a stable bowel regimen of Colace and Senokot and lactulose with prn mineral water enemas which she did not always hold effectively and Dulcolax suppositories.
We were concerned that if she started to bear weight on that foot the wound may potentially breakdown the vein graft anastomosis to her dorsalis pedis artery lies directly underneath the wound and we would like to do everything we can to keep the wound integrity intact.
She has had Silvadene ointment applied to both the eschar and her dry heel ulcer and is being kept in a multi podas splint with good results.
