HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer who presented to the clinic on [**2186-11-3**] for followup with complaints of fatigue and nausea with vomiting of coffee-grounds material.
She also had a recently admission to [**Hospital1 190**] after a transient ischemic attack versus cerebrovascular accident in association with a hematocrit of 16.
She had been asymptomatic from a neurologic standpoint since that event, and she was hemodynamically stable when seen in the clinic.
In the Emergency Department, she had laboratories which revealed a hematocrit of 20.6, and she became acutely hypotensive, at which time she was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for management.
Breast cancer; originally diagnosed in [**2178**] as a stage II-B infiltrating ductal carcinoma.
In [**2182**], she was found to have increased tumor markers and bone pain and was diagnosed with metastases to the left femur.
In [**2183-7-17**], the patient was on Taxotere and also had an allergenic stem cell rescue.
In [**2184-8-17**], she had increased bony metastases and was started on Navelbine.
She was stable after that point until [**2185-6-17**] when she was found to have a large mass in her abdomen and underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
As stated above, treatment was complicated by recurrent thrombocytopenia and anemia.
Tuberculosis as a child.
She has a maternal uncle with leukemia and bladder cancer, and a maternal aunt who had lung cancer.
Her maternal grandmother had breast cancer as well.
There were no palpable nodes on her neck.
Her heart examination was regular without murmurs.
Her abdomen was soft with normal bowel sounds, and no hepatosplenomegaly.
She had no appreciable distention or ascites at the time.
Her extremities were no different than their baseline revealing left upper extremity lymphedema since her mastectomy and some left lower extremity lymphedema as well.
Chemistry-7 was unremarkable except for some slight renal insufficiency with a blood urea nitrogen of 36 and creatinine of 1.1.
UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit after becoming acutely hypotensive.
Gastrointestinal was consulted; however, deferred an esophagogastroduodenoscopy due to the patient's thrombocytopenia and the risk of increased bleeding.
The possibility of esophageal varices was raised, and a right upper quadrant ultrasound was done; which revealed normal flow demonstrated to the portal and splenic veins, mildly dilated common bile duct, and mild hydronephrosis of the right kidney.
There was normal echogenic texture without evidence of focal abnormality within the liver, and the spleen was found to mildly enlarged (measuring 15.7 cm).
There were no further events of hematemesis.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient has chronically low platelets; likely secondary to her chemotherapy.
As the patient remained hemodynamically stable, there was no evidence of any clotting or any obvious bleeding at that time, no further intervention was done regarding the possibility of disseminated intravascular coagulation.
GENITOURINARY:  The patient has had bilateral ureteral stents placed due to an obstruction from her abdominal mass.
These stents were overdue for replacement.
Afterward, the patient voided without difficulty.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Prior to undergoing the ureteral stent replacement, the patient was started on ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis and continued for a complete 7-day course following the procedure.
In addition, given her history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, at the request of the Infectious Disease Department, she had perirectal swabs as well as nares swabs which did reveal Staphylococcus aureus which was resistant to oxacillin.
Metastatic breast cancer.
Thrombocytopenia and anemia secondary to chemotherapy.
