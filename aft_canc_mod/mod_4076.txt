Postop course complicated by actinic esophagitis (s/p PEG tube placemnt and tracheostomy).
Pt last CT scan [**5-12**] scan c LUL small mass suspicious for recurrent Ca.
Pt admitted on [**2105-1-20**] to OSH for fever, leukocytosis and worsening hypoxia.
CT of chest showed new large paratracheal mediastinal mass c small pleural effusion.
Pt had no improvement with worsening fever, hypotension, sepsis, hypoxemia and with deteriorating renal function.
Also started on PO Vanc for questionable C diff.
MRSA [**1-25**] of sputum grew MRSA .
Bronchoscopy was done which showed completely occluded L main stem bronchi.
Pathology confirmed presence of NSCLL.
Per verbal report of IP fellow, there was a erythematous and easy bleeding bronchial mucosa, without significant pus coming from L main stem.
Stage 3 lung cancer as well as a separate Stage 1 lesion, status post incomplete round of [**Doctor Last Name **]-Taxol and is currently undergoing radiation therapy.
Interstitial nephritis secondary to Lithium toxicity.
His chronic renal failure is currently stable.
History of seizures on Clozaril.
Head injury in [**2077**] with a loss of consciousness.
Outside records indicate that he also had a suicide attempt by jumping off a bridge in the remote past (?[**2077**]).
He has been on a variety of antipsychotic and mood-stabilizing agents in the past and has had at least two sessions of electroconvulsive therapy.
The patient reports that his father died of a amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in [**2065**].
Family History: Maternal grandfather with alcohol abuse, he denies a family history of mental illness or suicide.

[**2105-2-8**] CXR: There is probably a small right anterior pneumothorax manifested as deepening of the right lateral pleural sulcus, despite right apical pleural drain.
There is no pleural effusion.
Obscuration of the right hilus by a region of likely radiation fibrosis, and distortion of the left hilus and aortopulmonic window with left apical pleural thickening, partially calcified are all chronic findings.
Subsequent assessment of pneumothorax is better achieved with upright radiographs and supine study, likely S1.
A dialysis catheter recently placed in an outside hospital is responsibe for the small right pneumothorax which persists despite a right pleural tube.
A new, partially enhancing, 7 x 4 cm left paratracheal mediastinal mass with central hypodensity is likely necrotic tumor (unless the patient has had recent mediastinoscopy or transbronchial procedure, in which case some components could be hemorrhage; it has too much internal tissue structure for an abscess).
The mass obliterate fat planes around the aortic arch, left lateral trachea and right main pulmonary artery and subsumes previously enlarged paratracheal nodes as it extends along the left side of the trachea from the undersurface of the arch of the aorta to the superior margin of the left main bronchus which is markedly irregular, more likely due to invasion by the mediastinal mass than retained secretions.
In addiation to change around the left hilum there is new soft tissue opacity around the left lower lobe and subsegmental bronchi which could be the remnants of pneumonia or tumor recurrence in the lung.
Bronchocentric nodules in both lower lobes may represent infection or aspiration.
A small left pleural effusion, with attenuation value of 27HU is likely an exudate.
Peribronchial thickening is noted along the right upper lobe bronchus may also have been radiation-induced.
There is no right hilar adenopathy.
Diffuse esophageal wall thickening could be secondary to esophagitis, but adjacent to the mass infiltration by tumor is also very likely.
There are no bone findings suspicious for malignancy.
New peribronchial soft tissue, left hilus, either local tumor recurrence or pneumonia.
Bronchocentric nodules in the lower lobes could be secondary to aspiration and/or infection.
Right pneumothorax with chest tube in place.
Esophageal wall thickening, suspicious for tumor invasion, and possible diffuse esophagitis.
The patient is again seen to be status post left upper lobe resection.
Probable small right apical pneumothorax persist.
There is a nasogastric tube, which is coiled in the stomach.
Right-sided chest tube and tiny right apical pneumothorax, unchanged.
There is persistent opacification of the left hemithorax.
Patient is again noted to be status post left upper lobe lobectomy.
There is persistent small right-sided pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was intially admitted to Thoracic Surgery for surgical resection of recurrent cancer obstructing the left main stem bronchus.
The patient was continued on vancomycin (until [**2-15**] to finish 14 days course) and zosyn for post-obstructive pneumonia that was started at outside hospital.
The pneumothorax which developed at the OSH [**1-8**] central venous access attempt was managed with a chest tube and avoidance of PEEP on the ventilator.
CXR at that time showed worsened collapse of the left lower lobe from the obstruction, and the patient was empirically restarted on Zosyn to for post-obstructive pneumonia and the stent was repositioned on [**2-14**].
