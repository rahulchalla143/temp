Central line placement   History of Present Illness: 57 yo man with renal cancer metastatic to the lungs receiving IL-2 therapy with multiple cardiac risk factors including tobacco use, +FHx of MI by father in his 50s, possibly uncontrolled cholesterol, HTN, and overweight developed acute substernal CP the morning of admission.
EKG showed Lateral ST elevations in leads I & aVL along with a new Left IVCD.
The patient had an ECHO which only showed a mildly depressed EF of 40-45% but had mild hypokinesis of inferior/lateral walls.
Cardiology initially felt that the patient is not a cardiac catheterization candidate b/c of his low platelets and high creatinine.
The patient will be medically treated in the ICU to monitor for ongoing CP & cardiac monitoring.
He was intially admitted on [**9-1**] for elective IL-2 infusions for treatment of metastatic renal cell ca.
His hospital course was complicated by temp to 102 on [**9-2**] (thought to be infusion-related), ongoing diarrhea, nausea/vomiting (given anzemet), and acute renal failure (treated w/ fluids).
He had an episode of hypotension the day prior to admission (thought to be IL-2 related) and was briefly on neo from [**12-20**] pm yesterday.
The morning of admission/transfer, he patient complained of substernal chest pain and had EKG changes described above.
The pain was previously worse and improved with SL NTG.
Renal Cell CA- mets to Lung- receiving IL-2 Tx -had painless hematuria [**12-19**] --> treated for UTI w/ resolution of sx's -recurrent hematuria [**3-18**] ---> ABD CT with right, large renal mass measuring 17 cm w/ extension into renal vein, IVC.
Multiple pulmonary nodules noted bilaterally.
-- radical nephrectomy on [**2188-4-23**]: clear cell renal carcinoma, [**Last Name (un) 9951**]  grade IV high-grade with necrosis, invading through the renal capsule into the perinephric fat at the hilus -- follow up CT [**5-18**] w/ slight but definitive increase in most of his lungs nodules since the previous study with the largest increasing from ten millimeters to 13 mm -- presented for onc eval here by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**6-17**], planned for IL-2 this admission.
HTN 3.
Hyperlipidemia 4.
Weekend use of EtOH- no Hx of abuse, no IVDU.
Family History: Father died of MI in 50s.
Physical Exam: Admission PE VS: 96.7 91/69 61 16 99% on 3L NC I/O: 1273/650 out today so far at admission Genl: NAD, sleeping in bed, seems very sleepy but easily arousable HEENT/Neck: MMM, OP-clear, mild JVD w/ JVP at 9 cm CV: RR with distant heart sounds,no murmurs Pulm: Diffusely rhoncous lungs, fine crackles, some bronchial sounds, deep/productive cough.
CXR: left subclavian in SVC, interstitial and alveolar pulmonary edema .
Echo: LVEF 40% to 45% Mild LA enlargement.
Mild (1+) MR Lateral and inferior hypokinesis.
RUQ u/s: Normal appearing liver and biliary system without evidence of biliary obstruction.
CXR: Slight improvement in perihilar edema with residual perihilar haziness remaining.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment: 57 yo man with metastatic renal cancer to the lungs s/p IL-2 treatment with STEMI s/p stenting of LAD and LCX complicated by respiratory distress requiring intubation.
STEMI vs. myocarditis: Initially it was unclear whether his chest pain was secondary to an STEMI or myocarditis.
However, after the cardiac catheterization that showed LAD and LCx disease, as well as the elevated cardiac enzymes and improvement in chest pain with stents, this was most likely an STEMI.
Initially, this was medically managed due to high creatinine and low platelets, but he continued to have chest pain.
He had an ECHO which showed an EF of 30-35% with new anterior wall hypokinesis.
Respiratory distress: He was noted to be in respiratory distress and needed to be intubated.
This was likely secondary to volume overload, and he was shortly extubated.
Hypotension: He had several episodes of hypotension while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
The hypotension was thought to be secondary to decreased SVR.
Etiology could have been sepsis - his sputum cx grew GNRs.
This was thought to be secondary to a renal cause.
Acute renal failure: He was noted to have an elevation in his creatinine, with the peak at 3.4.
Acute liver failure: This was also thought likely secondary to IL-2 or shock-liver from an MI.
Elevated amylase and lipase - amylase and lipase were elevated to 172 and 641.
This may have been secondary to pancreatitis from low flow state to pancreas during MI.
During the hospitalization, he denied nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and did not have any difficulty with po intake.
Leukocytosis: He was noted to have a leukocytosis throughout his hospitalization.
He remained afebrile and was thus not treated with antibiotics.
