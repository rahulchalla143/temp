Of note she has had chronic diarrhea since her Whipple procedure, her usual diarrhea is brown but for the last month she has had "black tarry stools".
Of note she did have guiac + stool and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was to arrange for GI evaluation at that time, last colonoscopy was 5 yrs ago and showed polyp per patient, has never had EGD.
Of note recently admitted [**4-18**] for allergic response to oxaliplatin but noted to have a decreasing hct, and coumadin for her hx of PE was held.
No abnormal soft tissue density within the surgical resection bed in the pancreas is identified.
never tachycardic or hypotensive.
ROS: + melena, abd pain improved since ER Denies NSAIDS, ETOH   Past Medical History: Oncologic History: Stage IIB pancreatic cancer, status post Whipple surgery on [**2109-5-10**].
In total, she completed five cycles of gemcitabine on [**2110-1-8**], complicated by the development of febrile illnesses including hypotension requiring  ICU hospitalization.
During that evaluation, CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed likely disease progression involving the porta hepatis in the site of her pancreatic resection.
There was no overt evidence of hepatic metastases.

Stomach:  Other There was a small amount of red blood in the stomach but no obvious abnormalities seen.
At the initial portion of the efferent limb was blood and a 2.5 cm linear ulcer in the setting of irregular, heaped up mucosa.
Impression: There was a small amount of red blood in the stomach but no obvious abnormalities seen.
At the initial portion of the efferent limb was blood and a 2.5 cm linear ulcer in the setting of irregular, heaped up mucosa.
Most consistent with recurrence of her pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Less likely a benign anastomotic ulcer.
Will initiate carafate qid while awaiting pathology results ---------------- CT [**4-30**]  CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Multiple surgical clips are seen within the pelvis.
There is a tiny amount of air within the bladder.
There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy.
There is a moderate amount of fluid within the pelvis.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion identified.
Moderate degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine are identified.
No abnormal soft tissue density within the surgical resection bed in the pancreas is identified.
-------------- Ultrasound:FINDINGS: There are innumerable anechoic and hypoechoic lesions within the hepatic parenchyma, better evaluated on the recent CT, largerst consistent with simple cysts.
The IVC, right mid and left hepatic veins were evaluated and demonstrate normal directionality of flow as well as waveforms.
No evidence of portal vein thrombosis.
Numerous hypo- and anechoic lesions within the hepatic parenchyma, largest consistent with symple cysts, some are suboptimally evaluated on this study.
Micro Urine culture: + Ecoli, pan-sensitive .

The patient underwent an EGD that revealed a 2.5-cm ulcer at site of Whipple anastamosis, with no active bleeding, concerning for pancreatic cancer recurrence.
There was no other intervention performed.
On the floor, she continued to have melena with slowly down-trending HCT.
The GI team reported that due to the size and shape of the ulcer and the lack of obvious vessels that endoscopic cauterization would only damage more tissue.
She continued to have small amounts of melena which were thought to be residual blood moving through the GI tract rather than new bleeding.
She was started intially started on Flagyl and Cefepime prior to speciation/sensitivities with the thought that she had a GI source.
She was also noted to to have an Ecoli UTI which could also have been a source.
On day 9 of 14 day course, she was found to have SBP and was switched from Cipro to Ceftriaxone.
On [**5-9**] the patient developed a rapidly enlarging abdomen over one day.
The patient never developed fevers or chills.
