[**2100-7-1**] w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 365**] for hand-assisted laparoscopic Left nephrectomy.
6) RML/RLL PNA with parapneumonic effusion on [**12-21**] admission.
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2100-7-2**]  4:36:36 PM Atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response.
Poor R wave progression.
Cannot rule out old anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Lateral ST-T wave changes have resolved.
There is mild symmetric left  ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function  (LVEF>55%).
There is a minimally increased  gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) central  aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**12-7**]+) mitral  regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial  effusion.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid  regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Moderately dilated thoracic  aorta.
Large hematoma in left nephrectomy bed, consistent with acute hemorrhage.
Cystic mass in head of pancreas for which followup MRI is recommended when patient is stable.
Large right renal cysts.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and patchy airspace disease.
Blood flow images are normal, without focal abnormal hyperemia.
Dynamic blood pool images show no focal abnormality to suggest active hemorrhage.
Delayed images obtained 8 hours later also fail to demonstrate any definite site of active hemorrhage.
There is vaguely increased background activity over the region of the left nephrectomy bed but none approaching the intensity of the vascular blood pool.
IMPRESSION: No site of active hemorrhage identified.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 82 year old female who was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-1**], [**2099**] with multiple medical problems, recently diagnosed renal cell carcinoma, recent pancreatic cyst aspiration on [**2100-6-29**], post op for hand-assisted laparoscopic Left nephrectomy on [**7-1**].
She was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 25503**]#2 becuase of uncontrolled atrial fibrillation.
Echo on [**2100-7-6**] showed no significant change from [**12-11**] except new PAH.
On the morning of [**7-8**], she developed diffuse abdominal pain and tenderness, nausea, and her BP dropped to 80s systolic.
Of note, she had also developed worsening joint pain and had been given 30 mg prednisone on the evening of [**2100-7-7**] for a presumed pseudogout flair.
Ms [**Known lastname 45417**] was transfered to the T-SICU on [**7-8**] with an indication of an  Acute [**Month/Day (4) **] drop 26->19->12, an episode of hypotension (with symptoms).
An immediate CT abdomen was ordered, which showed a significant hematoma at the nephrectomy site.
On [**7-9**], she had an episode of a rash and hypotension during administration of packed red blood cells.
The episode resolved and there were no further complications on this day.
Physical therapy came in to see her; they felt she could not go home immediately as she was slightly unsteady on her feet.
She complained of some pain, and was given IV morphine which helped resolve the pain.
