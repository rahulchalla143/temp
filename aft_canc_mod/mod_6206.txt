The patient reports considerable difficulties with ipilimumab including intermittent abdominal pain and diarrhea which began on [**2171-7-4**] and arthalgias which started on [**2171-8-11**].
The arthralgias involve her wrists, elbows, small joints of the hands, knees and ankles, and sometimes she notices associated swelling.
The patient experiences frequent loose bowel movements, up to 2-3 per day, that are somewhat manageable with loperamide.
On [**2171-9-1**] she developed bright red blood per rectum and was hospitalized in [**State 1727**] ([**Hospital 63985**] Medical Center).
Her fevers and gastrointestinal bleed subsided and she was discharged on [**2171-9-6**].
Ms [**Known lastname 1391**] is currently being admitted for continued chills, fatigue and subphrenic/subpleural collection (?abscess,?metastatic lesion).
Over the past few days she has noticed a significant decrease in her energy level; she spends most of her day in the recliner and has alternating periods of time that she feels hot or cold.

New soft tissue mass at the right base which appears to involve the diaphragm and extends superiorly to the lung parenchyma and inferiorly to the region of the postoperative bed from prior right hepatectomy.
Additionally, there is a loculated pleural effusion with air consistent with hydropneumothorax.
Findings consistent with colitis involving the transverse and descending colon.
LUE US [**2171-9-17**]: IMPRESSION:  No evidence of DVT in the left arm.
CHOLANGIOGRAPHY VIA EXISTING PTC [**2171-9-27**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Small biliary leak seen from a peripheral branch duct, on selective cholangiography.
No intervention was performed - continued biliary diversion using the existing 8Fr PTBD.
Patient had prior hemihepatectomy in [**2167**] for metastatic ocular melanoma.
Presumed biliary pleural fistula is smaller and air inside the tract has resolved.
Small loculated right pleural effusion has also decreased in size, with improvement of adjacent atelectasis.
The superior component is stable and inferior component has less air, but is slightly bigger in size.
One is slowly progressive since [**2170-9-22**] in the left upper lobe, worrisome for metastasis.
Unchanged 12 mm lesion in the spleen.
Unchanged lytic lesion in L4 vertebral body.
Brief Hospital Course: 46F with metastatic ocular melanoma recently treated with ipilimumab presenting for evaluation of a soft tissue mass in the right lung base associated with fatigue and chills.
Recent hospitalization at [**Hospital 63985**] Medical Center in [**State 1727**] for fevers and GIB [**Date range (1) 81838**], treated with IV antibiotics and red cell transfusions.
#RIGHT LUNG BASE SOFT TISSUE MASS: In the setting of recent fevers/chills/fatigue there was a concern for an abscess formation and potentially a bronchopleural fistula.
This grew [**Female First Name (un) **] and pseudomonas and rare growth of Lactobacilli.
She produced significant bilious output from this chest tube over the proceeding days.
It was theorized this was secondary to biliary-pleural fistula.
This intervention significantly reduced the volume of output via the chest tube and improved her cough as well.
Definitive demonstration of biliary-pleural fistula was performed via angiography on [**2171-9-27**], which found a small fistula at the medial aspect of right hemidiaphragm.
Antibiotic recommendations for this infected fluid collection were tailored according to ID recommendations.
During management of this complicated condition, she unfortunately suffered an acute kidney injury.
This was most likely secondary to her peri-septic state, and completely improved following fluid resuscitation and antibiotics.
#GIB/COLITIS: Thought to be ipilumimab colitis but seemed to be improving.
She continued to have some diarrhea with bloody bowel movements.
GIB likely secondary to inflammatory bowel disease initiated by ipilumimab.
Her anti-diarrheal agents were optimized as below, with some improvement.
#HYPOALBUMINEMIA: Secondary to poor nutrition and potentially protein loss through colitis.
The patient's edema is likely secondary to her low albumin and recent IVFs.
#METASTATIC OCULAR MELANOMA: Patient with long history of ocular melanoma, treated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with ipilumumab.
Patient's prior hospitalization in [**State 1727**] due to upper GI bleed is suspicious for autoimmune colitis secondary to ipilumumab toxicity.
Her biliary-pleural fistula is potentially related to metastatic melanoma, but insufficient tissue was able to biopsied during her IR procedures.
Final decisions on whether to resume this regimen will be made after this acute process resolves.

During your work-up, you were found to have a connection between a portion of your bile system in your liver and your right lung.
You will need to follow-up with the thoracic surgery team (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for management of your chest tube.
Upon discharge, please call Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 20641**] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 13016**] or present to your local ER if you experience any of the following: fever, chills, chest pain, worsening cough productive of bile, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, worsening diarrhea, bloody or dark colored bowel movements, increasing extremity swelling, or any other symptoms that concern you.
