His recent admission was complicated by hypoxia, a pneumothorax s/p chest tube placement and removal and then urinary retention which ultimately resolved.
On the day of admission, a VNA came to change his dressings.
She found that the patient was slightly hypotensive with SBP 80's and hypoxic and called an ambulance.
The patient himself states that has been feeling a little anxious and shaky but feels normal.
He denies any changes in his health in the past few days, denies taking additional dilauded, no fevers, no chills, no coughing, + vomiting on the day after discharge, but no subsequent vomiting, nausea or diarrhea.
He endorses left lateral/flank chest pain [**1-17**] recent incisions but denies substernal or "heart" pain.
He denies any sensation of lightheadedness or syncope.
In the ED: The patient had no complaints.
EKG showed deeper ST depressions and T wave inversion, trop 0.6 - > started on heparin for ACS vs PE.
A non-contrast CT showed no fluid collection, no hematoma, some bibasilar atelectasis.
The patient was also found to have renal failure and transaminitis.

Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed minimal disease of the LMCA, widely patent prior LAD stents, mild restenosis of OM1, and 100% occluded RCA that fills via LCx collaterals.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated and equalized right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP, mean PCWP, and LVEDP of 20 mm Hg.
PASP was severely elevated at 71 mm Hg.
Left ventriculography revealed 1+ mitral regurgitation and LVEF of 50% with inferior hypokinesis.
Severely elevated right heart pressures and pulmonary hypertension.
Equalization of left and right sided filling pressures with possible restrictive vs. constrictive physiology.
Right ventricular hypertrophy with secondary repolarization abnormalities.
CT chest/abd ([**2128-10-14**]): No evidence of focal fluid collection in the abdomen or pelvis to suggest an abscess.
No evidence of hematoma in the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
Mild compressive atelectasis is seen in the left lower lobe subjacent to a trace left pleural effusion.
The patient is status post left VATS wedge resection of a spiculated left lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
Note is made of subcutaneous air along the anterolateral left chest wall.
RUQ U/S ([**2128-10-14**]): FINDINGS: There are no focal liver lesions.
The gallbladder is not distended, and no gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid is present.
There is no free abdominal fluid.
There is no intra- or extra- hepatic biliary dilatation.
Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
Bilateral LENIs ([**2128-10-15**]): No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
Echo ([**2128-10-15**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45 %).
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis with apical sparing.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Moderate-sized left pleural effusion, with associated atelectasis of the adjacent lung.
Bilateral renal hypodensities, too small to characterize.
Extensive atheromatous disease of the abdominal aorta.
CXR [**2128-10-18**]: Moderate left pleural effusion with subpulmonic component slightly increased from previous imaging on [**2128-10-15**].
Small right pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 16807**] is a 60 year old male with a history of CAD, PVD, and NSCLC recently s/p VATS and LUL resection who presented with hypotension and hypoxia.
Hypotension: The patient's initial presentation with hypotension resolved after receiving IVF boluses.
The etiology is unclear, but likely a mix of poor PO intake, resuming normal home anti-hypertensive regimen, and taking dilaudid for pain control post-operatively at home.
He also had NSTEMI (see below) - unclear whether this was the primary event or a result of hypotension.
Chest CT revealed a left-sided pleural effusion.
There was no evidence of pneumonia.
CXR on [**10-18**] showed moderate left lower and middle lobe effusion, slightly increased from previous imaging on [**10-15**].
This was thought consistent with recent h/o thoracic surgery, and given patient's low blood pressures, diuresis was considered but held.
Fever: Patient presented with fever, but given negative blood and urine cultures, and no consolidation on CXR, infectious etiology was not thought to be the precipitant.
He did have a positive monospot test, though his symptoms are inconsistent with active infectious mononucleosis.
Transaminitis: On admission the patient was found to have a transaminitis.
He had a very similar episode of hypotension, renal failure, and transaminitis in [**2128-3-16**] in which he was diagnosed with shock liver.
His transaminitis is likely due to hypotension in the setting of extensive [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] disease.
Acute renal failure: The patient presented with acute renal failure and a creatinine elevated to 2.3 on presentation.
ARF likely due to hypotension and [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] disease.
NSTEMI: The patient presented with a troponin of 0.60, CKD 258 and EKG with worsening TWI and ST depressions suggesting ACS although MB fraction was low.
It is also possible that troponin was elevated in the setting of renal failure.
Enzyme leak likely related to transient hypotension and not to unstable clot formation, therefore his heparin drip was discontinued.
LENIs were negative for DVT.
Hydroxyzine HCl 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for itching.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Sublingual prn as needed for chest pain.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: hypotension, with associated NSTEMI, acute renal failure, and transaminitis  Seconary: s/p recent left lower lobe wedge resection   Discharge Condition: Stable, improved.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for low blood pressure, low oxygen saturation, and fevers.
Your visiting nurse found you with low blood pressures at home shortly following discharge from your recent admission for wedge resection of a right lung nodule.
Due to hypotension, your cardiac enzymes, liver function, and renal function all showed evidence of temporary hypotension, which resolved with IV fluids and holding your blood pressure medications.
Return to the hospital if you have low blood pressure, fevers, shortness of breath or low oxygen saturation, syncope, lightheadedness, or chest pain.
