[**2143-6-2**] CT C spine w/o contrast: Degenerative changes without visualized acute fracture.
Mild anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 which could be accounted for by facet joint hypertrophic changes.
[**2143-6-2**] CT head w/o contrast: No acute intracranial abnormality or hemorrhage.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.
Enlarged right paratracheal lymph nodes when compared to previous exam from two weeks prior.
Given short interval change, this could be reactive or due to inflammation/infection, although metastatic disease is not completely excluded.
No acute intra-abdominal process.
Multifocal liver lesions compatible with metastatic pancreatic carcinoma.
No change to ill-defined lesion of the pancreatic head.
3 mm right upper lobe pulmonary nodule for which continued followup is suggested.
Micro [**2143-6-2**] Blood Cx x2: No growth at the time of discharge  Brief Hospital Course: 70M w/PMHx DMII, HTN, and pancreatic Ca metastatic to the liver on gemcitabine (last dose 2 days prior to admission) presents with explosive diarrhea, fever, chills, and right sided chest pain.
# Hypotension and lactic acidosis: Attributed to associated intra-abdominal infection.
Given the patient's recent copious diarrhea, no signs of infection (no fever, no tachycardia), and quick response to IV fluids, hypotension likely [**1-10**] hypovolemia.
The acidosis resolved with treatment of his underlying process.
Upon review of his recent LFTs by the ERCP team, there was a question if the biliary obstruction noted at the time of the additional stent placement could have occurred gradually in the recent past.
# Tranaminitis with jaundice: The patient was noted to have a cholestatic picture in the setting of requiring a new stent in addition to the prior stents.
# R sided atypical chest pain: Resolved on admission to the floor.
ECG showed no ischemic changes.
This pain was likely related to his cholangitis and functional biliary obstruction, which improved after stent placement and treatment of his infection.
One episode of chest pain later in the admission occurred with a large dose of oral potassium.
S/P fall: No LOC, no disorientation, no head trauma.
Hyperbilirubinemia: Likely [**1-10**] pancreatic ca and liver mets, but is increased from baseline.
-Repeat bili and LFTs showed gradual improvement over the course of the admission, and slow resolution of his jaundice.
Imaging: -Enlarged R paratracheal lymph nodes were noted on CT exam, increased in size from 2 weeks prior.
Inflammatory/Infectious cause thought to be more likely but metastatic disease is a possibility.
-3 mm R upper lobe pulmonary nodule --- continued follow up is recommended -Incidental finding on chest CT: There is some atherosclerotic plaque with ulcerative plaque at the inferior margin of the aortic arch laterally which is a stable configuration compared to prior exam from [**2143-3-26**], without surrounding inflammatory changes.
