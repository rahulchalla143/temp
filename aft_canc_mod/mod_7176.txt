Her sputum culture grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and sparse growth of gram-negative rods, but no further identification.
BRONCHIECTASIS ISSUES:  As the patient has baseline bronchiectasis with an increased risk of recurrent pulmonary infections, she was continued on her outpatient regimen of Ceftin 500 mg by mouth twice per day for seven days the first week of every other month alternating with ciprofloxacin 500 mg by mouth twice per day the first week of every other month.

The recommendation was that the patient was to initiate a by mouth diet with a pureed consistency, and she should be eating only nectar-thickened liquids.
She should have a repeat video swallow in one to two weeks, as it was thought that her aspiration to thin liquids was likely due to fatigue, and this should improve with rehabilitation.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.
