[**2192-4-12**] Ultrsounds of Lower Extremities:  - No evidence for DVT in right or left lower extremity.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 89278**] presented with profound anemia and an acute pulmonary embolus after recovering from a recent ankle fracture.
However, on review of her history and lab studies she had evidence of chronic blood loss anemia worse over the few days prior to presentation.
Upper, lower, and capsule endoscopies revealed no source of bleeding other than internal hemorrhoids.
The best estimate at her presentation included worsening constipation/hemorrhoids and a DVT/PE while recovering from her recent ankle fracture.
Fortunately, she improved with treatments for each of these conditions and is being discharged to follow-up with her new PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
Management of specific medical problems outlined below:  1.
Acute pulmonary embolism:  - thought to be provoked from immobility with cast on left leg and recent plane flight from [**Location (un) 3156**].
- given the bleeding and anticoagulation a retrievable IVC filter (OptEase IVC filter) was placed on admission.
If she does not have any complications on anticoagulation this should be removed.
- despite profound anemia on presentation she was treated with many days of anticoagulation while hospitalized and had no drop in her hematocrit.
Chronic blood loss anemia  - thought to be from a slow bleed internal hemorrhoids  - she was advised to take water, fiber, and stool softeners as needed to avoid constipation.
If the hemorrhoids continue to bleed she may need referral to a surgeon for consideration of banding or surgery.
Ankle fracture  - cast removed while hospitalized and placed in a walking boot.
Breast lymph node  - at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] she was noted to have an abnormal left breast lymph node on her CT angiogram (description under the results section of this discharge summary).

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 89278**],  You were admitted with severe anemia.
We think this was from a slow bleed from your hemorrhoids.
If your hemorrhoids continue to bleed or you need more transfusions you may need to see a surgeon for consideration of surgery for your hemorrhoids.
While here you were also noted to have a blood clot in your lungs.
**  To have your IVC filter removed, please call Call the Radiology Care Unit at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6747**].
