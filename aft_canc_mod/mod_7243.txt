A small PTX was noted in the left lung after the procedure and a pigtail catheter was placed.
A RUL collapse was also noted thought to be secondary to mucus plugging or aspiration.
A CXR showed a new lower lobe infilitrate and small effusion on right.
Given bedside TEE findings that showed a decreased CO and a mixed venous O2 in the high 50s, a cardiogenic component to his shock was entertained and dobutamine was added.
A follow-up CXR showed the evolution of a large left sided pleural effusion.
Upon being transferred to the MICU the Pt had been given 10.5 L of LR and was on norepinephrine, epinephrine, dobutamine and vasopressin.
Two additional chest tubes were placed that drained 1.5L of blood out of the left pleural space.

Successful RF ablation of lesion in the left lower lobe.
Small left pneumothorax managed with chest tube.
Bibasilar atelectasis and small right pleural effusion.
The known left-sided lung nodule is not visualized due to atelectasis.
Decreased size of left complex effusion with hemothorax component and resolved right pleural effusion.
Improved aeration with decreased parenchymal opacities, likely due to resolving congestive heart failure.
Abnormal orientation and position of the tracheostomy tube as discussed above, with focal collection of air outside the tracheal lumen around the tube.
Left renal cystic lesions, not fully characterized on this study.
Interval improvement in the diffuse interstitial pulmonary abnormality over the last three days represents remission of a component of pulmonary edema though whether there is interstitial lung disease at the lung bases is radiographically indeterminate.
No definite pneumothorax is present.
A large bulla in the right middle lobe displaces the anterior junction to the left.
Bilateral Upper Extremity Ultrasound RIGHT SIDE.
There is an acute thrombus involving the right axillary vein and extending distally to the level of the brachial vein.
This thrombus is relatively anechoic and is producing expansion of the vessel.
EKG:  normal sinus rhythm @ 83 bpm, normal PR/QRS/QT intervals, normal T waves, no ST segment elevations or depressions.
Respitory Status:  Patient developed a small right pneumothorax and large left hemothorax after IR radio-ablation procedure for a NSCLC mass in the left lower lobe.
On hospital day 3 his sputum grew out MRSA and he was treated with vancomycin for a 7 day course.
His respiratory status on the vent waxed and waned and after fluid resuscitation for hypotension was noted to have significant pulmonary edema.
After his course of vanco he continued to spike fevers and then sputum from [**12-13**] grew out Klebsiella that was sensitive to meropenem/gent/imipenem/pip-tazo.
Since the meropenem was started his sputum samples have been contaminated so no new data is available.
His fevers have drifted down, but continues to have low grade fevers at times which is felt to be secondary to his cancer.
After this he continued to have some difficulties with the trach so we attempted to deflate the cuff on the trach and allow patient to breath through both trach and mouth.
He has MRSA and Klebsiella pna and C. diff.
Etilogy felt most likely [**3-5**] cancer; other etiology included residual hemothorax v. empyema, however these were considered less likely given the patient continued to improve.
CAD - s/p LAD stents ~3wk pta On asa, plavix, bb, gemofibrozil; added ACE-I and titrated to lisinopril 10mg.
No evidence of ischemia throughotu his stay.
Afib w/ RVR Initially complicated by hypotension.
Seizure disorder On dilantin, required several IV loads.
Underwent RF ablation given he was a poor surgical candidate.
Adrenal insufficiency Currently on prednisone at home dose of 20mg.
C.diff- Patient found to be cdiff positive on [**12-13**].
Thrush- Started on 7 day course of fluconazole for thrush that was not resopnsive to nystatin.
