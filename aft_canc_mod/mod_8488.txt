Admission Date:  [**2120-10-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-11-13**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**] Chief Complaint: respiratory distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Chest tube placement-pigtail on right, pigtail/chest tube on left.
Intubation Mechanical ventilation   History of Present Illness: 85F with CAD s/p PCI, AFib on coumadin, breast CA s/p radical mastectomy, recent admission at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 100413**] for cough and dyspnea due to a left pleural effusion and pericardial effusion complicated by pericardial tamponade.
Left-sided thoracentesis [**10-17**] with removal of 600 cc fluid - WBC 660 (11% PMN 5% lymph 77% macro 4% reactive mesothelial cells) RBC 470 Tprot 3.5 (serum total protein 5.3) gluc 97 LDH 88 (serum LDH 153).
Cultures from these sites have been no growth to date and cytology from both taps was negative for malignant cells.
Referred from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab MACU for acute dyspnea and markedly diminished breath sounds on the left.
Diverted to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital temporarily for hypotension and hypoxemia (BP and O2sat not documented).
EKG showed sinus with 1st degree AV conduction delay and old inferiolateral T-wave inversions, but no QRS prolongation or peaked T-waves.
CXR showed complete opacification of the left hemithorax without mediastinal shift, and a small to moderate right pleural effusion.
Non-contrast chest CT showed left lung collapse and simple pleural effusion and increased pericardial effusion since [**10-19**].
Bedside U/S reportedly showed a circumferential effusion but no evidence of tamponade.
Thoracic surgery consulted, plan for thoracentesis vs. pigtail catheter when coagulopathy corrected, as well as for possible VATS pericardial window & talc pleurodesis on [**10-28**].
Upon arrival in the MICU, patient is without complaints.
Endorses shortness of breath with minimal exertion and cough with white sputum.
CAD s/p PCI [**2117**] 2.
Breast cancer s/p L radical mastectomy [**2114**].
Iron deficiency anemia.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
8. h/o hyponatremia (on sodium chloride at home) 9.
Intracranial hemorrhage [**2117**].
Osteoporosis with history of vertebral compression fractures.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation  Social History: Resident of [**Hospital 100**] Rehab MACU as of [**2120-10-24**].
No tobacco or ETOH.
Non-specific T wave changes in I, II, III, aVF, V3-V6.Compared to the previous tracing of [**2120-10-17**], except for slowing of the rate and a change from atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm, there is no diagnostic interval change.
Complete collapse of the left lung with interval increase in moderate to large left- sided pleural effusio.
Possible mucus plugging in distal left-sided bronchi; although underlying obstructive bronchial/ peribronchial mass is not excluded and follow-up study is suggested.
Moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
Small amount of pericardial air likely secondary to recent pericardial fluid drainage.
Dilated ascending aorta again seen, not optimally evaluated given lack of IV contrast.
Stable compression deformities of the thoracic spine.
Echo ([**10-27**]): The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated .
There is a small, primarily anterior partially echofilled space c/w an organized pericardial effusion.. No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-10-24**], the effusion is slightly/minimally larger but without evidence of hemodynamic compromise.
Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas as due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.
Pleural fluid samples: All samples had no malignant cells.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a trivial/physiologic posterior pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-10-28**], no major change is evident.
Pelvic U/S ([**11-8**]): IMPRESSION: 3.1 cm adnexal simple cyst, slightly increased in size from the prior CT, but with no other concerning features.
Chest xray ([**11-11**]): IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to chest radiographs since [**10-29**], most recently [**11-7**]:  Small residual left pleural effusion change.
Severe left lower lobe atelectasis changed in distribution, and probably worsened since [**11-7**].
Atelectasis at the right lung base is milder than the left and improved since [**11-7**].
Right upper lobe is clear.
Brief Hospital Course: Summary: 85 yo female with coronary artery disease status post PCI, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, breast cancer status post radical mastectomy, recent hospitalization for cardiac tamponade status post pericardiocentesis left-sided pleural effusion status post thoracentesis readmitted with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis in the setting of recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions.
#Bilateral pleural effusion (left>right): The patient presented with respiratory distress and was found to have a recurrence of her left sided pleural effusion leading to complete left lung collapse and hypoxemia, requiring intubation.
A talc pleurodiesis was performed and the patient's pain was controlled with Dilaudid at first and then oxycodone thereafter.
She continued to be diuresed with Lasix, however, she developed a metabolic alkalosis with a respiratory acidosis.
Her final chest xray shows left lower lobe atelectasis.
The patient continues to have an oxygen requirement, likely due to her atelectasis and possibly an underlying pulmonary process.
Analysis of the pleural fluid showed the absence of malignant cells in cytology, no bacteria/viral/acid fast bacteria on repeat cultures, and flow cytometry showed no cells concerning for lymphoma.
The pleural effusions might be due to exacerbation of her diastolic heart failure, though on prior admissions, the effusion did not appear to be a transudate.
Lastly, A CT of the abdomen from [**2117**] showed a cyst in the lower abdomen.
A CA125 was mildly elevated and a CA19-9 was in the normal range.
A pelvic U/S was done to further characterize the cyst and it was noted to be a simple cyst and not concerning for malignancy.
#Septic shock:  The patient was initially hypotensive and the differential included septic shock vs. cardiogenic shock.
A bedside echo in the ED did not find evidence of tamponade, so the patient most likely had septic shock with the source of infection being pulmonary.
She was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics vancomycin/zosyn to cover hospital acquired pneumonia and the patient improved.
She completed a full course of vancomycin/zosyn for hospital acquired pneumonia and did not have any other signs of hemodynamic instability.
#Acute on chronic anemia: The patient continued to have a low hematocrit with iron=10 (L) and a slightly high ferritin.
The patient might have an underlying iron deficiency anemia, though it is unclear given her high ferritin.
#Acute renal failure:  The patient presented with acute renal failure, which was likely prerenal azotemia given UNa<10.
With treatment of her hypotension, the patient's renal failure trended towards her baseline around 0.6-1.0.
With continued diuresis and the addition of lisinopril for BP management, the patient developed acute renal failure again.
#Urinary tract infection: The patient presented with a urinary tract infection and was treated with vanco/zosyn as detailed above.
Two days after her Foley was removed, she had a leukocytosis without fever or dysruia.
A urine culture revealed pan-senstive Pseudomonas 10,000-100,000 colonies.
Treatment with Cipro was initiated and her leukocytosis trended downwards.
# Anxiety and Depression- Continue trazodone and ativan as needed.
The patient was noted to be anxious during the hospitalization and would consider further therapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor as an outpatient.
Since the patient remained in a sinus arrhythmia (not in atrial fibrillation on telemetry) throughout hospitalization, it was felt the risks of Coumadin outweighed the benefits, therefore, she will not continue on Coumadin.
She will continue to take aspirin, metoprolol and amiodarone for her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
# Recurrent pericardial effusion: The pericardial effusion has also been a recurrent issue.
A TTE showed an effusion without hemodynamic compromise, therefore, it was treated medically.
A repeat echocardiograms showed a reduced effusion.
#H/O hyponatremia: The patient has a history of hyponatremia that has been attributed to the syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone release.
In fact, she should avoid sodium since it might precipitate congestive heart failure, the possible etiology of her pleural effusions.
# Swollen right arm: The patient was noted to have a swollen right arm.
An ultrasound ruled out a deep venous thrombosis.
With diuresis, the swelling improved, so it was likely related to fluid overload.
# Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl .
# Osteoporosis: Continue Vitamin D/Calcium .
# GERD: Continue omeprazole .
# Memory loss: The patient's family states that she does not have any memory loss.
