A large, friable,ulcerated, oozing mass was noted at the efferent limb entrance.
Biopsies were positive for gastric adenoca with areas of invasion and ulceration.
EGD was complicated by duodenal perforation (anterior D3 wall thickened with air, retroperitoneal air), which was managed conservatively with NGT decompression, broad-spectrum antibiotics, TPN, and serial CT scans.
There was diffuse thickening of duodenal wall and possible gas within duodenal wall.
The collection was of high-density contrast which per the report sounds like it was extraluminal.
Follow up CT scan on [**2181-7-9**] showed a 7 x 8.2 cm mass arising from the greater curvature and fundus of the stomach, which is abutting and possibly invading the splenic flexure of the colon.
Another soft tissue lesion is noted adjacent to the lesser curvature of the stomach and body of the pancreas measuring approximately 23 mm (series 2 image 19) which cannot be further evaluated.
Small fluid collection with gas bubbles posterior to the second portion of the duodenum measures 3.2 x 1.5 cm, best seen on series 2, image 32.
No definite extravasation of oral contrast.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] consulted regarding possible surgical options.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] then came up with multiple options to deal with large mass and presented these options in detail to patient and family.
Patient developed worsening acidosis and hypotension and was taken back to the operating room on [**2181-7-24**].
Postoperatively he was in the intensive care unit on pressors and maximal support.
He slowly improved and went back to the operating room on [**2181-7-28**] for abdominal washout and exploration and then again on [**7-31**] for washout and abdominal closure.
CT scan obtained showing No drainable fluid collection.
