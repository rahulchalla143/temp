Admission Date:  [**2105-5-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2105-6-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2037-3-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**] Chief Complaint: Neck and Shoulder Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Septic joint washout PICC line placement L hallux ulcer debridement x2   History of Present Illness: This is a 68 yo M with a past medical history of DM, HTN, who presented to an OSH with neck pain on two different occasions and on the third presentation, has altered mental status and fevers, had an LP and was admitted.
His course was subsequently complicated by a GPC bacteremia, and worsening neck pain, and ?upper extremity weakness, was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for MRI of neck to rule out epidural abscess.
He was found on MRI to have no definite signs of epidural abscess in the cervical or thoracic spine, but was then found to have decreased L shoulder range of motion with significant pain.
Ortho was consulted, and tapped the joint, which was consistent with septic arthritis, with [**Numeric Identifier 79644**] WBC.
He was also noted to have an ulcer on his left foot which probed to bone.
Labs were notable for a white count of 20K, mild elevations in LFT's, mild hyponatremia and CRP>200, ESR 80.
At this time, patient denies fevers, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, hematochezia, melena, weakess or other symptoms.
He is currently denying shoulder pain after the surgery, but does not continued neck soreness, though improved from prior.
Past Medical History: HTN DM2 History of hyperkalemia Gout   Social History: Married with 6 children.
Family History: non-contributory, son has significant diabetes with complications  Physical Exam: VS: T 98.4 142/80 82 18 94% on RA GEN: NAD HEENT: AT, NC, PERRLA, EOMI, mild conjuctival injection, anicteric, OP clear, MM dry, Neck supple, no LAD, no carotid bruits, small area of tenderness over cervical spine but improved from prior per patient CV: RRR, nl s1, s2, I/VI SM @ LLSB no r/g PULM: CTAB, no w/r with good air movement throughout, scattered rhonchi on the right base ABD: soft, NT, ND, hypoactive BS, liver margin 2cm below costal margin.
EXT: warm, dry, +1 distal pulses BL with trace edema of the foot, per report 1x2cm ulcer on the bottom of the left great toe, slightly bloody, no obvious pus (had been wrapped and unwrapped throughout the day and patient deferred exam at this time).
L shoulder wrapped in sling, full radial pulse NEURO: alert & oriented, CN II-XII intact, left should exam limited due to immobility from surgery, otherwise, 5/5 strength throughout.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is a 0.3cm by 0.3cm mobile echodense structure (see cell 17) on the LVOT side of the aortic valve that may be a small vegetation (orLambl's excrescence).
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Possible small aortic valve vegetation; no aortic regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
MRI OF THE CERVICAL AND THORACIC SPINE.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with question of epidural abscess.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of epidural abscess seen in the cervical region.
No abnormal intraspinal enhancement is identified.
At the craniocervical junction and C2-3, degenerative disease is identified.
At C3-4 mild irregularity of the endplates is identified without abnormal signal within the disc or enhancement to indicate discitis.
Mild-to-moderate left foraminal narrowing seen.
At C4-5, C5-6, and C6-7, mild disc bulging and posterior ridging identified without spinal stenosis.
No definite signs of epidural abscess, discitis, or osteomyelitis.
Mild increased signal in the prevertebral soft tissues in the cervical region without distinct fluid collection.
This could be due to fluid within the nasopharynx.
If the patient has trauma, mild prevertebral edema can also have a similar appearance.
Mild multilevel degenerative changes.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of discitis, osteomyelitis or epidural abscess seen in the thoracic region.
No abnormal enhancement identified.
Mild posterior ridging of the mid lower thoracic vertebral bodies identified which appears to be congenital in nature.
Mild multilevel degenerative changes are seen.
The spinal cord shows normal intrinsic signal without extrinsic compression.
IMPRESSION: Mild degenerative changes.
No evidence of discitis, osteomyelitis or epidural abscess in the thoracic region.
COMMENT: A small amount of fluid is seen in the atlanto-odontoid and atlantoaxial joint anteriorly which could be due to degenerative in nature.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 68 yo M with GPC bacteremia with septic arthritis of L shoulder and electrolyte abnormalities.
# Group C Strep Bacteremia/Endocarditis: Initially with sepsis physiology though was stable upon arrival to the medicine floor.
Obvious cause is group C strep bacteremia, likely source is L toe ulcer that is also growly group C strep.
Neck pain was concerning for abscess, but MRI here did not show evidence of this, patient continued to refuse any further neck imagining despite continued decreased ROM of his neck.
Given bacteremia, TTE was done which was negative, however, TEE was performed showing evidence of an aortic valve vegetation.
# L foot ulcer: Patient had non-healing ulcer, swab positive for group C strep, and this likely represents the source of his bacteremia.
# Septic Arthritis: Patient has been bacteremic with group C strep, which is has likely seeded the L shoulder synovial space via hematogenous spread.
He has a history of gout, but an acute gouty flare in this joint is uncommon without multiple other joints being affected and the findings of pus on washout is also inconsistent with gout.
Also concern over persistent neck pain and evolving abscess or seeding as above.
He refused any further head or neck imaging throughout his stay.
# Acute renal failure: Patient with creatinine bump from 0.8 to 1.2 overnight during admission.
Patient maintained good UOP until his last day of admission at which time he had urinary urgency and hesitancy with a positive bladder scan.
He did have bilateral hydro on an OSH renal US, and a repeat renal US was performed showing unchanged mild-to-moderate hydronephrosis.
As the patient had difficulty urinating, likley due to BPH, he was sent home with a foley/leg bag with urology follow up as he refused to stay any longer for further work up.
# Transaminitis: Found on admission, resolved without intervention.
Otherwise, etiologies included congestion from sepsis, drug induced hepatitis (although level of transaminitis is quite low), CBD pathology (but TB is wnl).
Most likely secondary to dehydration from evolving sepsis on admission.
Abd ultrasound done was c/w fatty liver or other liver disease which cannot be excluded, though no evidence of emboli.
# Hyponatremia: On admission.
Silver Sulfadiazine 1 % Cream Sig: One (1) Appl Topical DAILY (Daily): to L foot ulcer with dressing change.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Group C strep bacteremia Aortic valve endocarditis Septic arthritis of left shoulder Hypertension Type II DM, uncontrolled Gout   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with bacteria in your blood.
Your shoulder had bacteria in it as well that was cleaned out by the Orthopedic surgeons.
You also were found to have bacteria on your heart valve (endocarditis).
You had a non-healing ulcer on your toe that is likely the reason you had bacteria in your blood.
If you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, increased shoulder pain or inability to move your shoulder, dizziness, vision changes, abdominal pain, or any other concerning symptom, please call your primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 10046**]d to the Emergency Room immediately.
