Admission Date:  [**2142-10-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-10-30**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1070**] Chief Complaint: cough, SOB, ARF.
History of Present Illness: 84 yo Russian speaking man with h/o MDS, PAF and new congestive heart failure of unclear etiology with gradual decline since the middle of [**Month (only) 359**].
Originally noted lower extremity edema and cough in mid [**8-27**] pillow orthopnea over the last year (change compared to previous [**11-26**] pillows last year).
He denied fever, chills, nausea or vomiting.
He appeared volume overloaded on exam and had an elevated BNP.
Since his discharge, he has had significant difficulties at home.
He had TFTs showing new hypothyroidism, but unlikely source of CHF.
Over the last 12 hours, no urine output.
No other symptoms.
Past Medical History: - Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); dx'd [**2131**], requiring Q 2wk transfusions (last 2u PRBCs [**9-24**]), treated with azacitidine first five cycles followed by thalidomide, but he since stopped this for unclear reason, possibly due to fatigue.
He does not have any history of drug abuse.
Abd: soft, NT/ND, +BS, no hepatosplenomegaly Ext: 2+ LE pitting edema, 2+ dp and radial pulses b/l, no cyanosis.
CXR [**2142-10-22**]: New bilateral small pleural effusions and mild fluid overload.
Enlarged bladder, no hydronephrosis in the setting of a moderately enlarged prostate gland.
Patient was unable to void and this is likely due to acute surely urinary retention, depending on clinical correlation.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis with mild hypokinesis elsewhere.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation are now more prominent.

The patient was evaluated by renal who felt much of his failure was also due to poor cardiac output in setting of his worsening heart failure.
2) Systolic congestive heart failure: The patient was volume overloaded on exam (elevated JVP and LE edema, and effusion on CXR) and was therefore diuresed with IV lasix.
Approximately 1.5L was diuresed, with modest improvement in SOB and resolution of LE edema.
Unfortunately, the Pt's recuperation seemed to be limited by a combination of poor PO intake and inability to tolerate cardiac meds (both afterload reducers for CHF, and rate and rhythm controllers for PAF), due to low bp (baseline 90s/50s).
IVF boluses did help to keep bp up, but due to poor cardiac function and tendency toward 3rd-spacing fluids, this was not an effective measure for long-term pressure support.
Several episodes of desaturation into the high-80s prompted a repeat CXR which revealed worsening bilateral pleural effusions.
was evaluated by both cardiology and renal, and his poor cardiac function was felt to be due to multi-vessel coronary artery disease and cardiomyopathy due to iron overload (from multiple transfusions for MDS).
was started on ASA, BB, and propafenone, the latter two of which were more often than not held due to low bp.
