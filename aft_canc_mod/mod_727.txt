Admission Date:  [**2134-2-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2134-2-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2064-8-4**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Location (un) 259**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69 year old male with a past medical history significant for renal cell carcinoma, coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction, deep venous thrombosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and pan-hypopituitarism, who was admitted to [**Hospital1 1444**] on [**2-11**], status post radiofrequency ablation of a residual renal mass.
The patient was subsequently noted to be hypotensive after the procedure which was refractory to intravenous fluids and necessitated a Medical Intensive Care Unit admission.
He was treated with Stress dose steroids, initially, given his history of pan-hypopituitarism.
His oxygen saturation decreased and he had a VQ scan to rule out pulmonary embolism, which was indeterminate.
On [**2-16**], he was noted to be increasingly somnolent and tachypneic, with gross hematuria, decreased urine output and an increased creatinine from 1.4 to 2.4.
The patient was intubated emergently for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
The patient subsequently had one out of four blood cultures positive for Gram negative rods as well as E. coli in his urine.
A chest x-ray on [**2-18**], revealed left lower lobe consolidation and collapse and his sputum revealed a three plus Gram negative rods.
The patient was seen by the Renal Service for acute renal failure on [**2-18**].
He was noted to have a CT scan with contrast on [**2-15**], and his acute renal failure was attributed both to hypotension as well as to contrast ATN.
He then complained of increasing groin pain, and his hematocrit was noted to have dropped six points.
A CT scan of his leg revealed a collection medial to the right femoral vein tracking down along the femur.
Renal cell carcinoma status post left partial nephrectomy in [**2128**].
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass graft times four in [**2128**]; this procedure was complicated by sternal dehiscence, status post partial sternotomy.
Atrial flutter status post DC cardioversion two years ago.
Deep venous thrombosis in [**2131**], on Coumadin initially and subsequently Lovenox for recurrence.
Status post lower gastrointestinal bleed in [**2133-10-1**], with colonoscopy revealing rectal ulcer and benign polyp.
T10 compression fracture.
Pituitary adenoma with pan-hypopituitarism.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.4 to 1.5.
ALLERGIES:   The patient has a questionable allergy to Lasix; he reports a rash in response to this medication.
In general, he was a very alert, pleasant and conversant male who was mildly dyspneic with conversation.
On neck examination, his neck was noted to be supple without lymphadenopathy or visible jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular examination:  The patient had an irregularly irregular rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
It was obese, soft, nontender, and nondistended, with no hepatosplenomegaly.
His extremities were warm without visible cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
He had right groin ecchymoses with a hematoma medially and posteriorly.
He had an EKG which revealed normal sinus rhythm with supraventricular extra systoles.
On studies on [**2-20**], he had a unilateral lower extremity vein ultrasound which did not reveal any evidence for deep venous thrombosis or pseudo-aneurysm.
On [**2-20**], he had a CT scan of the abdomen which revealed a heterogeneous mass extending from the level of the pubic symphysis to the proximal femur posteriorly consistent with hematoma.
On [**2-18**], he had a transesophageal echocardiogram which revealed an ejection fraction of 45%, mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction, left ventricular wall motion abnormalities with basal infero-septal and inferior and apical hypokinesis.
He had asynchronous motion of the inferior wall possibly secondary to a conduction delay.
On [**2-20**], he had a chest x-ray which revealed consolidation/collapse of the left lower lobe.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 69 male with a history of coronary artery disease, renal cell carcinoma status post left partial nephrectomy, admitted for hypotension in the setting of urosepsis.
Now, he presents with a right groin hematoma and decreasing hematocrit status post right femoral line placement.
He had had atrial fibrillation in the setting of anemia and sepsis.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient had a history of a lower GI bleed with a recent esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy, which were negative.
Here he had guaiac positive stools.
We will not evaluate the patient's GI tract during this hospital stay, however, we recommend that the patient have an outpatient GI evaluation.
He did not have any further evidence of renal failure.
Infectious Disease:  The patient was continued on Ceftriaxone to complete a ten-day course for pneumonia and urosepsis.
He remained afebrile throughout his hospital stay.
Renal cell carcinoma.
Deep venous thrombosis.
Diabetes mellitus.
Atrial flutter.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
