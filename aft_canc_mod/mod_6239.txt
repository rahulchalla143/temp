DIAGNOSIS: I. Ampullary adenoma (A-B): Adenoma with small focus of intramucosal adenocarcinoma.
Focal inactive pancreatitis with ductal mucinous metaplasia.
Duodenal mass (AO-AS): Adenocarcinoma arising in an adenoma with invasion into the duodenal wall.

There is obstruction of the right bronchus intermedius.
Small amount of pleural fluid on the left with associated atelectasis.
Unusual appearance of the left humerus, which is felt to be the result of the artifact.
Collection of gas and fluid subjacent to the anterior abdominal wall in the vicinity of several of the anastomotic sites.
Injection of the percutaneous biliary drain, demonstrated extravasation of contrast outside of the confines of the hepaticojejunostomy, with free extravasation outside of the jejunal limb, collecting around the region of the pigtail drainage catheter within the complex gas and fluid collection.

Circumferential/radial (mesenteric or retroperitoneal) margin:         Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma.
Distance of carcinoma from closest margin:  30 mm.

Following the procedure, he was kept intubated and intermittently on vasopressors and kept in the PACU overnight for close monitoring post operatively.
He was transfused 2 units RBC overnight for a low hematocrit.
