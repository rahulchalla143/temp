Admission Date:  [**2181-9-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2181-10-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-1-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Iodine / Lisinopril / Amoxicillin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: SOB, lethargy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation PICC line placement  History of Present Illness: 79 year old woman with history of severe oxygen dependent COPD, and recent diagnosis of likely metastatic lung cancer (diagnosed on imaging, no biopsy yet) who presents with 2 days of difficulty breathing, fatigue, slight confusion, and irritablity.
At baseline, the patient is on [**2-24**] L O2 at home for severe COPD.
Per her daughter and son, she has had increasing shortness of breath over the past 2 days with new production of green thick sputum.
No observed fevers or chills.
Symptoms are associated with increasing fatigue and appearance of anxiety.
The patient's family increased her O2 to 6L, but symptoms continued to progress.
New widespread right pulmonary opacities, concerning for infection versus edema.
Persistent right upper lobe mass.
Scan revealed an enlarging right upper lobe mass, bulkly mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and a presumed large liver metastasis.
No biopsy was performed, as the patient would likely be a poor candidate for both surgery and chemotherapy.
Postherpetic neuralgia.
Productive cough chronically.
Diabetes type 2.
Son prostate cancer and diabetes   Physical Exam: On admission  Vitals:  VS. 98.6  108/56  83 94% on CMV with FIO2 40%, TV 350, PEEP 10 General: Intubated, sedated.
Opens eyes and moves all 4 extremities to command; able to answer yes/no questions with nodding HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: Mild right-sided crackles; prolonged expiratory phase with poor air movement Abdomen: soft, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly GU: foley in place Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: Moves all 4 extremities on command.
New widespread right pulmonary opacities, concerning for infection versus edema.
Persistent right upper lobe mass.
Patient has known right upper lobe lung mass and hilar lymphadenopathy.
Diffuse heterogenous opacities in the right lung are unchanged.
There is most likely complication of lung cancer , less likely pneumonia.
If any there are small bilateral pleural effusions.
Left lower lobe opacity is new worrisome for focus of pneumonia.
There is no pneumothorax.
CXR ([**10-1**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimal improvement of the extensive parenchymal opacity on the right, notably the level of the right lower lobe.
A slight increase in lung density on the left is caused by positional factors.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 year old woman with history of severe oxygen dependent COPD, and recent diagnosis of likely metastatic lung cancer who presents with difficulty breathing, fatigue, confusion, and irritablity; found to have hypercarbic respiratory failure and likely pneumonia.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure [**2-22**] pneumonia and pulmonary malignancy:  She has baseline severe COPD and new diagnosis of lung cancer complicated by acute decompensation.
She was intubated in the ED for airway protection due to unresponsiveness.
Acute fluffy infiltrates on CXR (R > L), and worsening cough productive of green sputum concerning for large aspiration pneumonia as a source of decompensated lung disease.
She became very difficult to ventilate, given the 2 entirely different physiologic properties of the 2 lungs (congested, cancer-filled lung vs. hyperinflated, COPD lung).
Her peak airway pressures remained quite elevated and she required a large amount of sedation in order to be comfortable.
# Acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia:  As her condition continued to worsen, her creatinine started to rise and her urine output dropped off precipitously.
Concomitantly, her potassium increased markedly, likely secondary to the metabolic acidosis as well as severe constipation.
Her hyperkalemia eventually caused her to become increasingly bradycardic and eventually pass away.
