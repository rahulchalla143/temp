Admission Date:  [**2108-12-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2109-1-4**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Plavix  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**] Chief Complaint: GI bleeding due to Esophageal Ulcers  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endoscopic Gastroduodenography (EGD) External Beam Radiation therapy   History of Present Illness: 89 year-old female with a history of bladder cancer metastatic to liver who presents with melena, hematemesis.
The patient was initially evaluated in the emergency room and found to be tachycardic and given IV fluids.
The patient was transferred to 11 [**Hospital Ward Name 1827**] where the patient triggered for tachycardia to the 130s.
An NG lavage was done that showed coffee ground emesis that cleared with 700 cc lavage.
At that point GI consultation was called who recommended ICU transfer, pantoprazole IV drip and serial hematocrit.
On arrival to the medical floor the patient was afebrile with BP 118-123/60-78, HR 120-130s 100% RA.
On evaluation on the floor and on ICU transfer the patient had only mild dizziness and lightheadeness.
She denies chest pain, abdominal pain.
She was also noted with increasing acute renal failure on her stage III CKD.
ROS: In reviewing the recent weeks with the son, the patient has had worsening mental status over the last few weeks, increased weakness in the last month.
She has had persistent LQ abdominal pain that is treated with meds listed.
The pain has been intermittently controlled.
This is her first episode of epigastric chest pain, hematemesis and melena in the last few years.
Past Medical History: Bladder cancer [**2-17**] with known lung metastases, currently on radiation therapy for pain control Hypothyroidism anemia celiac sprue COPD (previous exacerbations requiring steroids) history of ventricular septal defect history of hysterectomy/BSO Nephroureterectomy in [**3-14**].
CVA [**2-17**]-- d/c with aggrenox ?
She ambulates around her apartment with a walker.
Family History: Non-Contributory  Physical Exam: GEN: Thin cachetic appearing woman in no acute distress.
HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, no epistaxis or rhinorrhea, pale, dry MM, OP Clear, swelling of right cheek NECK: No JVD,  no bruits, no cervical lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: RRR, no MRG, normal S1 S2, radial pulses +2 PULM: Lungs CTAB, no W/R/R ABD: Soft, NT, ND, +BS, no HSM, no masses EXT: 2+ edema of LE, pitting to knees, no palpable cords NEURO: alert, oriented to person, place, and time.
No gait disturbance.
No cerebellar dysfunction.
Alert and oriented x [**2-12**] (in hospital [**Location (un) 34564**], [**Month (only) **], knows DOB) SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
Sinus tachycardia.
Mild J point and ST segment elevation in the early precordial leads with Q waves through to lead V3 may be related to axis but consider anteroseptal myocardial infarction, age undetermined.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Diffuse intrathoracic metastatic disease.
Likely mild volume overload.
Extensive infiltrative process in the liver consistent with the history of metastatic bladder cancer.
Mild central biliary dilatation.
Small aortic aneurysm of 23 mm in diameter.
Residual evidence of old nonocclusive bilateral lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..          DUE TO LOSS OF VIABILITY, UNABLE TO IDENTIFY FURTHER  CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2108-12-30**] 4:49 AM FINDINGS: Metastatic lung nodules are again visualized with nodules and diffuse lymphangitic infiltration.
There is no new infiltrate.
There is likely small left effusion that is increased.
This may be due in part to lower lung volumes, but a small component of mild pulmonary edema is probably present even though heart size is normal and there has been no engorgement of mediastinal or hilar pulmonary vasculature.
Severe metastatic involvement of both lungs consists of scores of nodules up to 2 cm in size and diffuse lymphangitic infiltration.
Small bilateral pleural effusion is probably present.
There is no pneumothorax.
Gastrointestinal Bleeding due to Esophageal Ulcers: She underwent endoscopy, which showed a  superficial linear ulceration in the distal 3rd of esophagus.
No evidence of bleeding during the EGD.
At the GE junction, there was more extensive ulceration with a single 1 cm shelf-like lesion.
There was a 5 mm red spot without a vissible vessel and no active bleeding.
There was a large greyish material in fundus.
She was started on [**Hospital1 **] protonix, and had no further bleeding.
Would be wary of hypotension, and would suspect adrenal insufficiency if it develops and would give stress dose steroids.
History of Deep vein thrombosis, possible pulmonary embolism:  She was persistently tachycardic, and had lower extremity ultrasounds that showed evidence of an old DVT.
Due to risk of bleeding, with recent GI bleed and severe thrombocytopenia, Lovenox was discontinued except for prophylaxis dose subcutaneous heparin.
Non ST elevation myocardial infarction: She had evidence of elevated troponin and CK, in the setting of her upper GI bleed.
She did complain of chest pain which resolved with pain control.
Bladder cancer metastatic to Liver, Lung: She was recently diagnosed with a new bladder tumor, after having longstanding bladder cancer.
Per discussions with her oncologist, and work up here, this was found to be metastatic to liver and lung.
She was followed by palliative care, and was started on standing oxycodone for pain control, with good effect.
Acute Renal Failure on Chronic Kidney Disease Stage III, hyperkalemia: She has baseline stage III chronic kidney disease, with worsening here in the setting of the bleed.
Her abdominal ultrasound showed no kidney on the left, consistent with her prior nephrectomy, and no hydronephrosis on the right.
History of Stroke: Aspirin is currently on hold, and may be restarted post discharge for CVA prophylaxis.
Urinary tract infection:  Her initial UA showed many white cells, but culture showed gram positive rods.
She was treated with ciprofloxacin for 5 days, although the culture was never speciated due to technical reasons.
# Disposition:  To nursing facility, with likely transition to home hospice.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: One (1) Puff Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for dyspnea.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for fever or pain.
GlycoLax 100 % Powder Sig: One (1) packet PO once a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] of [**Location (un) 583**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Gastrointestinal bleed Esophageal Ulcers Metastatic bladder cancer with Mets to Liver Acute renal failure Chronic kidney disease Stage III Urinary tract infection Thrombocytopenia  Discharge Condition: Stable  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with vomiting blood from an esophageal ulcer.
You were also found to have old blood clots in your legs, and worsening kidney failure.
Return to the emergency room if you develop shortness of breath, chest pain, severe abdominal pain, inability to urinate, black tarry stools, vomitting blood, vomitting coffee ground material.
