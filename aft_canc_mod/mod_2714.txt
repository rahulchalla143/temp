Admission Date:  [**2116-12-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2116-12-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2053-4-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**] Chief Complaint: Arterial clot  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 61228**] is a 63 yo man with a history of advanced colorectal cancer on erbitux (C6D1 [**2116-12-4**]) who is a direct admit from the [**Hospital **] clinic for a right brachial arterial clot.
The patient began having RUE pain 2 weeks ago while on a trip to [**Location (un) 5354**].
An ultrasound found no RUE DVT.
At his clinic visit afterward, he reported no swelling although he noted that his right arm felt somewhat cold and a "dead weight".
He also c/o numbness in the arm distal to the elbow.
He was started on aspirin due to concern for an arterial clot and scheduled for RUE doppler today.
The doppler today showed a right brachial artery clot at the antecubital fossa.
Exam following this revealed a strong left radial putse but a notably weaker to absent right radial pulse as well as SBP decreased by 20-30 mmHg in the RUE.
His fingers did not appear blue or mottled.
He denied any fevers or chills.
Of note, the patient's erbitux treatment has been suboptimal due to his side effect of severe fatigue.
His dose frequency was reduced from weekly to every other week, and this has been further complicated by his travels during the holidays.
Currently, the patient denies any pallor, poikilothermia, pain, or paresthesias in the R distal arm.
Endorses exertional L calf pain with 300 yds, resolves with 3 min of rest.
He states that the quality/nature of this pain has not changed in years.
Past Medical History: Mr. [**Known lastname 61228**] is a patient with advanced colorectal cancer who has multiple therapies in the past.
His tumor was tested for DPD deficiency and he indeed was found to have a high susceptibility for toxicity from 5-FU based therapies based on heterozygous mutation in his DPYD gene.
His tumor also is wild type for K-RAS, and therefore, cetuximab based therapy has been initiated.
Erbitux has caused acneiform rash, and he has felt profound fatigue with this regimen.
He also had an episode of mild renal insufficiency of unclear etiology but this has resolved.

Other Past Medical History: Hypertension S/p appendectomy and tonsillectomy when he was a child s/p Right internal jugular vein thrombus, [**6-/2112**]   Social History: He owns a metal machining company.
He has a 15-pack-a-year smoking history - etOH: occasional - Illicits: none   Family History: Negative for colon cancer, uterine cancer, or any other GI malignancies.
Compared to [**2115-12-24**], the Q waves are more makred and the ST segments have become more concave with new reciprocal changes.
OTHER STUDIES: [**2116-12-22**] RUE ultrasound: No acute right upper extremity DVT.
[**2116-12-25**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the basal inferolateral wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Very suboptimal image quality.
Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
No definite valvular pathology identified.
No definite structural cardiac source of embolism identified.
Soft tissue mass within the retroperitoneum causing left-sided hydronephrosis and proximal left hydroureter is not significantly changed.
No significant change in tiny bilateral pulmonary nodules.
Status post left hepatic lobectomy.
Right hepatic lobe liver hypodense lesion is slightly decreased in size when compared to prior exam.
CT Head W/O Contrast [**2116-12-25**]: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass-effect.
If concern persists for intracranial mass, further evaluation with MR is recommended    Brief Hospital Course: This is a 63 year old man with hypertension and metastatic colon cancer presenting with new arterial thrombus and found to have ECG changes consistent with myocardial ischemia but with flat CK's.
1) Right brachial arterial thrombus: Patient was found to have a right brachial artery clot seen on ultrasound doppler on [**2116-12-25**], so was admitted for management.
He is predisposed to thromboembolism likely due to history of active malignancy.
Patient was started on heparin gtt after a head CT ruled out large mets, and he was evaluated by vascular surgery for thrombectomy.
The ideal management would be life-long lovenox; however, patient was adamant about not taking lovenox since he does not want to have bruises on his abdomen.
2) EKG changes: After patient was admitted to OMED, his ECG revealed concerning ECG changes including ST depressions laterally and elevations in II, III, and aVL.
Enzymes revealed an elevated troponin (but in the context of chronic kidney disease) with flat CK's suggesting a subacute event.
Patient denied any recent shortness of breath, chest pain, orthopnea, PND, syncope, or presyncope.
His EKG changes were impressive for inferior ischemia, but given old Q's and flat CK's, lack of symptoms, essentially normal EF, it did not seem that this was new acute ischemia.
Patient was continued to aspirin, beta-blocker, started on statin, and he was already on heparin for arterial thrombus.
3) Metastatic Colon Cancer: Patient will need further staging and management given difficulties in maximizing therapy.
4) Depression/Irritability: Patient was likely undergoing major depressive episode vs adjustment disorder exacerbated by steroids.
5) CKD: Baseline creatinine around 1.4-1.6, due to previous obstructive uropathy.
7) PPx: Patient was on heparin drip for DVT prophylaxis.
