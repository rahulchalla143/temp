Mild hypothermia protocol was initiated, and patient was transferred to the MICU for further management.
Upon arrival to MICU, patient exhibited progressive decline in systolic blood pressure to <70 mmHg, despite maximum doses of Phenylephrine, Epinephrine, and Norepinephrine and repeated iv fluid boluses, and exhibited persistent acidemia, lactic acidosis.
Following extensive discussion with family members (including daughter/HCP [**Name (NI) 4317**] [**Name (NI) 931**]) regarding overall poor prognosis and unlikelihood of recovery due to repeated episodes of pulseless cardiac arrest requiring CPR and profound hypotension despite extensive vasopressor support, no further interventions were pursued, no further CPR, and focus of care transitioned to comfort.
