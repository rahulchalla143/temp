HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 88 year old woman with past medical history of CLL, tuberculosis, status post nine months of medical treatment; nephrolithiasis; recurrent urinary tract infection; chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine between 1.5 and 2, who presented to the Emergency Department for malaise.
She was having no abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting or diarrhea.
She did complain of some chronic constipation.
She was having no urinary symptoms such as urgency, frequency or dysuria.
She has required previous transfusions related to decreased hematocrit from CLL.
Recurrent urinary tract infection.
Chronic renal failure.
Peripheral vascular disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
She had anicteric sclera.
Her neck was supple, with mild anterior tenderness over the area of the thyroid, which the patient reports is not new.
Regular rate and rhythm; normal S1 and S2; coarse breath sounds were noted, but no rhonchi, rales or wheezes.
Her abdomen was flat with poor muscle tone.
There were positive bowel sounds and diffuse mild tenderness to deep palpation.
Pitting edema was noted to the knee; left greater than right.
Urinalysis was cloudy, with moderate LE and positive nitrites, large blood; 30 protein; 21 to 50 white blood cells; 3 to 5 red blood cells; rare bacteria; 0 to 2 epis.
She had a chest x-ray done in the Emergency Department showing bilateral patchy opacities that may be secondary to atelectasis or low lung volume.
The patient was admitted to the floor for acute on chronic renal failure with noticeable elevated anion gap, metabolic acidosis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The [**Doctor First Name **] was well above one, arguing against a prerenal cause of her acute renal failure.
The positive urinary tract infection was treated with Ciprofloxacin.
The renal ultrasound acquired on the night of admission showed severe right hydronephrosis with a 16 mm stone in the lower pole of the right kidney.
The left kidney was not well visualized but in previous imaging done in [**2104-11-3**] had severe hydronephrosis.
CT non contrast of the abdomen was taken as well, which showed a very atrophic left kidney as well as right hydro.
Given the presence of obstructive uropathy, as well as evidence of infection in the urinalysis, a urology consult was called the night of admission.
Urology evaluated the patient and recommended watching the cultures and fever curve and continuing antibiotics and intravenous hydration.
A formal renal consult was called the following morning, in order to fully evaluate her acute renal failure.
Her tuberculosis medications were discontinued, secondary to concerns for INH exacerbating her acidosis as well as concern that multiple medications have been previously implicated as a cause of acute interstitial nephritis.
The Ciprofloxacin was dosed for her estimated creatinine clearance for her urinary tract infection.
She received intravenous fluids with b1 to attempt to compensate for her acidosis and her chemistries and arterial blood gases were monitored.
Renal felt there were multiple possible causes for the acute episode of renal failure, including infection, dehydration, medications and chronic obstruction.
Her urine was noted to be cloudy yellow and have some particulate matter in it.
Urinalysis clearly showed pyuria but cultures remained negative during the hospital stay.
The patient continued to receive intravenous fluids with bicarbonate as well as Ciprofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection and her creatinine continued to improve.
There was an ongoing discussion between the renal service, urology service and medicine service, with regards to help as to handle this episode of renal failure.
Her creatinine had clearly been climbing slowly over the last two years, in the setting of a chronic obstructive uropathy.
Urology was not included during this visit to engage in any lithotripsy or attempt to break up or remove the stone sitting in the right kidney.
They were concerned about her comorbidities as well as her low platelet count from CLL.
There was discussion of a possibility of a percutaneous nephrostomy for the right kidney, in order to attempt to relieve the obstruction and hence preserve some kidney function and stave off the need for ultimate dialysis.
Over the week-end of the [**11-16**], the patient developed persistent wheezing that was not particularly responsive to Albuterol and Atrovent nebs.
She had no known history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Repeated chest x-ray showed evidence of mild failure.
Given the absence of history of lung disease, the wheezing was preliminarily presumed to be a cardiac wheeze, as a result of hydration for the renal failure.
By this point, her creatinine had continued to fall and was now under 3.0 so the decision was made to add some Lasix diuresis prn in order to improve her congestive heart failure.
Despite successful diuresis, her wheezes continued and she continued to have shortness of breath.
The cause of the respiratory abnormalities were unclear to the care team.
The leading theory was still that intravenous fluids with bicarbonate as well as the transfusion she had required early in her stay for anemia had caused a fluid overload and the heart failure was the cause of her respiratory difficulty.
On the evening of [**11-20**], the cross cover house officer was called to the patient's side for shortness of breath and wheezing.
She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit that evening for her respiratory distress and maintained on ventilatory support.
A right internal jugular line was placed and she was briefly put on pressors for low blood pressure.
The patient had a CT of the chest ordered which showed multiple, ill-defined nodules in the right upper lobe, with peribronchial wall thickening, possibly due to progressive infection, such as granulomatous disease versus tracheobronchitis, via neoplastic infiltration.
There was also apparent tracheobronchial malacia noted when the patient breathed during the examination.
There was chronic middle lobe collapse with a probable broncholithiasis.
There was a small pericardial effusion that appeared improved from previous examination and interval resolution of the left pleural effusion.
An echo done on the 19th showed an ejection fraction of over 55% with mild left ventricular hypertrophy, 1+ aortic regurgitation, trace mitral regurgitation and no evidence of tamponade.
The pulmonary team remained unclear on the source of her CT abnormalities as well as her continued breathing difficulties.
The pulmonary team felt that bronchoscopy to take samples would be inappropriate given the code status and the potential for decompensation during the test.
The patient was placed on intravenous Ceftazidime and thought that perhaps this represented a pneumonia and that she might improve with antibiotics.
During the last days of her stay, her respiratory status did improve and she had decreased rhonchi, elimination of wheezing and improved shortness of breath.
The patient had the onset of some abdominal pain that she first noticed in the unit that increased over her first few days back on the floor.
She also noted episodes of diarrhea that created some incontinence and were very distressing to her.
During her hospital stay, the patient did develop a rash on her buttocks that appeared consistent with zoster.
The acute renal failure appeared to have completely resolved and her creatinine had fallen to 1.6.
She was diarrhea and abdominal pain free and feeling much better.
Acute on chronic renal failure.
Respiratory failure, status post intubation.
Possible misocomial pneumonia.
Nephrolithiasis with chronic obstructive uropathy.
