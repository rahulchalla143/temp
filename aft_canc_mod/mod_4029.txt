Patient was sent here due to hyperkalemia noted at [**Hospital **] rehab.
with EKG changes (EKG showed peaked T waves and a widened QRS).
He was found to be febrile and hypotensive with a leukocytosis.
Sources of infection included osteomyelitis/discitis verses AVF.
For his hyperkalemia he was dialyzed and his EKG was followed.
He developed Afib with rates to 150's, he was given an additional beta-blocker which helped.
All of his other medical problems were stable on home meds.
On the floor, patient without complaints.
Denies CP, SOB, abdominal pain, N, V, confusion, palpitations, melena, diarrhea or constipation.
He has no complaints now.

Physical Exam: In ICU Exam: 100.4 -->97.3, BP 115/47, HR 90, R 20, 100% on 2L Gen: NAD, pleasant HEENT: MMM, no JVD, EOMI CV: regular with frequent ectopy, no murmurs appreciated Chest: Abd: +BS, soft, nontender, nondistended ext: no edema, 2+ PT, warm neuro: CN 2-12 intact, strength 4/5 throughout .
On floor 97.1, BP 98/40, P 72, RR 16, 99%RA Gen: NAD, pleasant HEENT: MMM, no JVD, no LAD CV: RRR murmur noted though faint Chest:  CTAB Abd: +BS, soft, nontender, nondistended ext: no edema, 2+ PT, warm neuro: CN 2-12 intact, AAO    Pertinent Results: Initial EKG: baseline RBBB, widened QRS, peaked T waves .
EKG after HD: RBBB, QRS and T waves improved .
No evidence of pneumonia.
Probable compression deformity and narrowing of intervertebral disc space, upper lumbar spine.
ECHO: Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Regional left ventricular wall motion appears normal (in some views the inferior wall appears hypokinetic but this may be due to frequent ectopy/irregular rhythm).
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is heterogeneously increased T2 signal as well as diffuse enhancement of these vertebral bodies and disc, consistent with spondylitic discitis.
There is paraspinal and epidural phlegmon without a discrete abscess.
At T12/L1, there is a left lateral disc bulge extending from the foramen to the extraforaminal region.
There is no significant central canal or neural foraminal narrowing at this level.
IMPRESSION: L1/2 spondylodiscitis with paraspinal and epidural phlegmon without a discrete abscess.
Left venous upper extremity ultrasound: IMPRESSION: Intraluminal thrombus within the left IJ vein.
There is a small soft tissue fluid collection adjacent to the left shoulder, which may represent a small post-procedure hematoma .
Osseous destruction at L1-2 with paravertebral soft tissue consistent with osteomyelitis/discitis, better demonstrated on recent MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**2118-8-4**].
Bilateral pulmonary consolidation and pleural effusions, likely representing pulmonary edema, although superimposed pneumonia is not excluded.
No evidence of intra-abdominal abscess.
Gallstones, without evidence of cholecystitis.
Absent bilateral native kidneys and atrophic-appearing transplant kidney, right pelvis.
CXR [**8-9**]: There has been a substantial increase in perihilar pulmonary consolidation which is seen on the lateral view to lie in the upper and middle lobes, less so in the lower.
In addition, there are discretely nodular opacities seen in the lower lungs particularly on the right, all of which points to disseminated infection, alternatively progressive pulmonary hemorrhage, rather than pulmonary edema as suggested previously.
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable and there is no appreciable pleural effusion.
There has been interval increase in thickness of the right paratracheal and mediastinal soft tissue probably combination of azygos vein distention, mediastinal fat deposition, and some increase in central adenopathy.
Left supraclavicular dual-channel dialysis catheter has been advanced to the lower third of the SVC.
There is no pneumothorax .
Abnormal focal osseous uptake along the right aspect of the L1 and L2 vertebral bodies which may represent osteomyelitis, though non-specific.
Marked diffuse cardiac uptake, which could be consistent cardiac amyloidosis.
Pneumonia 2.
No convincing evidence for spinal osteomyelitis although In-111 white blood cells may have some decrease in sensitiviy in the spine.
There is a loculated high T2 signal collection anterior to the scapula extending anterior to the shoulder.
Several round low signal lesions are present in this collection.
Findings are nonspecific but most likely represent severe glenohumeral degenerative changes with an effusion containing degenerative loose bodies.
Bilateral upper lobe lung consolidations .

1) Fever of unknown origin/discitis/osteomyelitis/pneumonia: The patient presented with high fever spikes.
During hospital course, the patient continued to have fever spikes.
Therefore infectious disease was consulted regarding fever of unknown origin.
Patient also had a known history of discitis and osteomyelitis of L1-L2/epidural abscess in [**3-28**].
A new MR of spine was obtained during his hospital course that demonstrated continued L1/2 spondylodiscitis with paraspinal and epidural phlegmon without a discrete abscess.
Other infectious work up during hospital course included a trans-thoracic echocardiogram which was negative for valvular vegetations, ultrasound of chest wall (where HD catheter was) which was negative for absess, ultrasound of left upper extremity deep veins that demonstrated DVT in left IJ, initial CT thorax that did not demonstrate any absesses, but revealed bilateral pulmonary consolidation and pleural effusions, which likely represent fluid overload (although are considering other etiologies on differential), bone scan, WBC scan (revealing pneumonia), bronchoscopy, and an MR of the shoulder (possible effusion noted).
A repeat CXR was performed later in his course, which raised the possibility of disseminated infection or septic emboli.
This led to a pulmonary consult, and per their suggestions, we rechecked his Chest CT after dialysis, sent sputum samples and sent out an anti-GBM antibody.
Later in his course, the CT of the chest and the white cell scan revealed a multilobar pneumonia, so a bronchoscopy was performed.
This, with his fever and tachycardia was worrisome for sepsis, so he was transferred to the ICU for fluid resuscitation.
Later in his course all antibiotics were stopped such that the patient's fever curve and cultures could be followed off antibiotics.
2) Atrial fibrillation:  In the ICU, the patient converted into atrial fibrillation with a rate of 140-150 following hemodialysis.
The patient denies atrial fibrillation in the past, but this could be related to the stress of infection.
The patient remained on telemetry, and was only noted to have ventricular bigeminy.
Then patient was noted to not have this allergy, and started on heparin.
Deferred initiation of coumadin to outpatient setting (as patient was only in atrial fibrillation for short time period).
3) Hyperkalemia: His hyperkalemia resolved status post dialysis, kayexylate, calcium/bicarb and insulin.
His hyperkalemia on admission was attributed to the fact that he had recently missed dialysis and that his dialysis catheter was not functioning properly.
4) Left Internal Jugular Vein clot: The patient was noted to have a clot of Left internal jugular vein on ultrasound.
There was a questionable allergy to coumadin noted in the chart, so while this was being confirmed, anticoagulation was postponed.
He did well with nephrocaps, renal diet, and hemodialysis.
