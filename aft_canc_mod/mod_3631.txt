Admission Date:  [**2102-5-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2102-5-21**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Codeine / Vicodin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain and SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: patient expired [**5-21**].
History of Present Illness: 87 year old male with h/o CAD s/p CABG, Afib, SSS s/p PPM, CHF with EF 35%, moderate-severe AS, HTN, HL, and prostate cancer who presented on [**5-3**] to [**Hospital3 **] with worsening SOB found to have an [**Hospital 39700**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath, and now transferred to CCU in setting of worsening respiratory distress and [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing.
He reports over a month of shortness of breath which worsened in the few days prior to admission and was associated with worsening peripheral edema.
His weight increased 10 pounds over one week prior to admission with substantial peripheral edema.
He then developed nausea and vomiting and presented to the ED at [**Location (un) **].
At the time of admission to OSH he denied any chest pain.
He also endorsed 3 pillow orthopnea and severe PND.
Yesterday he had an episode of recurrent chest pain with transfer from chair to bed that lasted 15 minutes and resolved without intervention.
He was not given lovenox or a heparin gtt given anemia Hct to 28-30.
He was chest pain free on transfer.
He was also started on digoxin at the OSH for his CHF and was also started on amiodarone.
While at [**Hospital1 18**] today, he went to cardiac catheterization; prior to procedure he became very nauseous and endorsed difficulty breathing.
His breathing difficulty was noted to consist of periods of apnea associated with rapid, short breaths, thought to be consistent with [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of syncope or presyncope.

Probable severe aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 50, mean gradient of 30, which given his degree of left ventricular dysfunction likely represents critical aortic stenosis.

Moderate pulmonary insufficiency 7.
No other drugs.
[**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer or ?prostate cancer.
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.

Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa Neck: Supple with elevated JVP to the temple.
Loud crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur heard at LUSB and systolic murmur heard at apex.
Fine rales at the bases bilaterally with mild bronchial breath sounds in left midlung.
Nontender and slightly protuberant.
Extremities: 2+ peripheral edema to the knees on the left, to the shins on the right.
Left 4th digit with swelling and discoloration around the nail and severe pain with palpation.
Also mild erythema up to center of the dorsum of his right foot, no tenderness to palpation of that area.
There is calcification of the thoracic aorta.
There is a dual-lead right-sided pacemaker.
Lungs are grossly clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusions, or overt pulmonary edema.
There is tortuosity of thoracic aorta.
Degenerative changes of the AC joints and spine are noted.
There is severe end-stage osteoarthritic changes of the first MTP joint with complete loss of joint space and large spurs.
Vascular calcifications are also seen.
There are no signs for acute fractures or dislocations.
Extensive vascular calcifications are present.
There are no destructive bony changes to indicate radiographic evidence for osteomyelitis.
If there is high clinical concern, MRI could be performed.
No soft tissue gas is seen.
[**2102-5-11**] Echo: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
There is an inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Markedly dilated right ventricle with depressed systolic function.
Severe aortic stenosis (calculated by continuity equation, low cardiac output).

Severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Severe pulmonic regurgitation.

# Shortness of breath: Component pulmonary edema and [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] respirations.
Started Ultimately patient became DNR/DNI and wanted hospice with goal being comfortable breathing which was achieved with low doses of morphine and ativan po as needed at onset of respiratory distress.
Patient went into respiratory distress overnight [**5-20**], not responding to po or iv morphine.
CAD: Likely had NSTEMI in setting of recent demand from CHF with troponin elevations, however patient decided against intervention.

No acute intervention planned based on patient wishes.
