He was discharged [**10-1**] to home where he reports having done well for several days.
He was seen by ID on [**10-2**] at which time he mentioned a cough and a sputem sample was sent.
He has a cough at baseline (x3 years) however this has become productive of brownish sputem over the last few weeks.
No acute process on OSH Hospital CXR.
Denies worsening of his abdominal wound infection.
Labs were notable for leukopenia with WBC count 0.2 (34% PMNs).
He denied any specific complaints.
-  Status post left nephrectomy in [**12/2139**] with clear cell carcinoma of the kidney with stage limited to kidney only with no lymph node involvement.
-  Noted recurrence of his disease in [**12/2141**] with initiation of treatment on the bendamustine study, status post five cycles of therapy, which was then put on hold as of [**2142-3-27**] due to development of hemolytic anemia.
-  Status post Rituxan x 3 for noted paraspinal lesion then received XRT to the area, completed [**2143-1-2**].
-  CT scan in [**1-/2143**] showed wall thickening with 4-cm segment of sigmoid colon; follow up colonoscopy with noted focal prominent atypical B-cell infiltrate with immunoperoxidase studies revealing CD20 + B cells with co-expression of CD5.
-  Rituxan on hold as CT scan in [**3-/2144**] showed no evidence for lymphoma, but notable gallbladder soft tissue nodule confirmed on ultrasound on [**2144-5-20**].
Biopsy revealed the gallbladder with adenomyoma and mild chronic cholecystitis with no gallstones present.
Liver core biopsy showed no definitive fibrosis with features consistent with toxic/metabolic injury.
-  Persistent anemia with some dysplastic features noted on his differential which was followed over time and advised to decrease/stop drinking, which he has successfully done since [**42**]/[**2144**].
His counts have normalized with no further immature cells in his differential.
Cardiac catherization had shown 80% blockage of LAD with single vessel coronary artery disease.
-  Persistent abdominal cramping and change of bowel pattern.
CT scan in [**8-/2145**] showed no increased adenopathy but noted large sigmoid polyp; biopsy from [**2145-9-8**] revealed non-Hodgkin lymphoma with more aggressive phenotype with Mib fraction about 70%, initiated treatment with bendamustine and Rituxan on [**2145-10-12**] and status post four cycles of therapy completed on [**2146-1-4**].
-  FDG tumor imaging on [**2145-12-6**] following three cycles of therapy showed no evidence for FDG-avid lymphoma with no adenopathy noted within the bowel in particular.
-  Colonoscopy on [**2146-2-1**] showed no abnormalities noted on the sigmoid biopsy.
-  Admitted to OSH for pneumonia treated with antibiotics with resolution after a period of time.
Repeat CT scan at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2146-8-2**] showed the previously described left upper lobe nodule has decreased in size and become less round with two new lung nodules, measuring 13 mm in the right upper lobe, and measuring 5 mm in the right lower lobe corresponding to areas on CT from OSH.
-  VATS with right upper lobe wedge resection for biopsy of nodule on [**2146-9-9**] which revealed extranodal marginal zone lymphoma(MALT).
-  Persistent sinus symptoms with CT scan showing significant sinus disease.
Received prolonged course of antibiotics with plan for possible sinus surgery.
-  PET scan on [**2147-1-31**] showed progression of his lymphoma in the head and neck area including cervical nodes, left temporalis muscle, and likely left parotid involvement as well as within the left rectus muscle and left mesenteric external iliac nodes.
Core biopsy of the rectus abdominal muscle on [**2147-2-13**] showed involvement by his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma marginal zone.
-  CT scan of the chest from [**2147-9-29**] showed new diffuse peribronchovascular ground-glass opacities predominantly in the upper lobes, most suggestive of an infectious etiology.
Evaluated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] and felt to have bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and treated with Voriconazole with improvement in ground glass opacities.
-  CT of the chest abdomen and pelvis on [**2147-12-15**] showed no evidence for lymphomatous disease.
Improved ground-glass opacities in bilateral lungs compatible with improving infection.
Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
-  Sinus surgery on [**2148-2-1**], due to persistent sinus symptoms and receiving IVIG monthly due to hypogammaglobulinemia.
-  In [**3-/2148**], noted for an enlarging lymph node in the left lower cervical and supraclavicular area; PET imaging on [**2148-3-29**], showed new bilateral cervical lymph nodes, left supraclavicular lymph node peritoneal nodules and numerous musculoskeletal foci with FDG uptake consistent with recurrence.

# Septic Shock: SBPs 90s in ED which have which responded fluid resuscitation.
Most likely pulmonary source with sputum [**10-2**] with pan-sensitive pseudomonas.
Notably worsening cough with purulent sputum production.
No clear e/o PNA on CXR however possible retrocardiac process.
Other possible sources include a retropharyngeal abscess or less likely dissemination or his cutaneous M chelonae infection.
Considered fungal coverage and sent off beta-glucan and galactomannan per ID recs (both were negative).
Repeat CT chest showed new infiltrate and CT sinus showed worsening opacifications.
He underwent laryngoscopy by ENT, which did not reveal any evidence of sinus infection, but showed some laryngitis of unclear etiology.
# Sinusitis/Pharyngitis: Pt with few days of sore throat.
Given history, concern for retropharyngeal abscess or fungal infection.
CT sinuses showed evidence of worsening opacifications.
He was discharged on nystatin for  # Wound Infection:  Abdominal would infected with M chelonae.
# Marginal Zone Lymphoma: He has had marked progression of disease in the last few months, as seen on recent PET scan and was admitted for 1st cycle of RIME [**Date range (1) 51905**] Immunoglobulins were sent and showed low IgG and IgA.
Additionally, he was continued on valcyclovir & bactrim for prophylaxis.
He was continued on neupogen until he was no longer pancytopenic.

You were admitted for treatement of your neutropenic fever and sepsis.
You were determined to have an infection in your lungs which was likely contributing to your low blood pressure.
They saw that you have an infection in your larynx, which was also treated with antimicrobial agents.
While you were admitted you were found to have low levels of IgG and IgA.
During this infusion you had a reaction (rigors) despite pre-medication.
The infusion was stopped, and your symptoms were treated with medications including benadryl, hydrocortisone and demerol.
You stopped having fevers, and you no longer became neutropenic.
