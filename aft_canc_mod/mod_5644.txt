On arrival to the floor, the patient denies pain or difficulty breathing.

Wound dressed, bleeding through bandage.
There may be a small superficial ulcer, anteriorly, with no evidence of deeper subcutaneous emphysema or gas-filled tract reaching the underlying bone.
There is amorphous radiodense material in the deep soft tissues between the stump margin and the fibular resection site, which may represent heterotopic ossification, dressing material within the deep ulcer, or less likely, retained surgical material.
The knee joint, itself, is unremarkable, with no effusion or acute osseous abnormality.
There is no definite evidence of osteomyelitis.
There is a hemodialysis catheter, with the tip in the SVC.
There is a right pleural effusion, an area of increased opacity in the right lower lobe which is difficult to assess due to the marked rotation.
No definite pneumothorax seen.
Right pleural effusion, and questionable opacity in the right lower lobe .
No previous tracing available for comparison   Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo male with multiple medical problems, recent sepsis and R knee [**Name (NI) 6024**] who was admitted to the MICU for hypotension and unresponsiveness.
Given the patient's elevated lactate, it was thought that his hypotension was most likely due to sepsis.
The patient was given broad spectrum antibiotics including Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Zosyn given recent instrumentation and possible new opacity on chest x-ray.
It was felt by the surgery team that his wound was most likely not the source of infection as the site appeared relatively clean, with no frank pus.
Plain films were done and did not show any evidence of osteomyelitis, emphysema, or effusion.
Renal was also consulted as he was a dialysis patient.
It was felt that he did not require acute HD at that time, and it was recommended to pursue CVVH overnight if the patient became more overloaded with fluid resuscitation.
His elevated troponin in the setting of ESRD and hypotension was thought to be from demand rather than ACS, as his CK enzymes were flat and his EKG did not have any ST changes suggestive of ischemia.
An echo was ordered to assess for any wall motion abnormalities and it was planned to obtain his medical record from the VA to better understand his cardiac history.
Although the patient was found to be unresponsive in the ED, he was awake and oriented x 2 on arrival to the ICU.
She stated that she did not want central line placement, pressors, or antibiotics.
Another daughter was also present for the conversation, and it was discussed with both family members and the patient about what the cause of his hospitalization was thought to be, what role the antibiotics and IVF played in treating him, and that if these measures were to be stopped, he would most likely die.
The patient was given a dose of morphine to help with his progressing respiratory distress.
The patient became apneic, bradycardic, and eventually asystolic.
