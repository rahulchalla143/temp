These findings are indicative of multiple areas of cortical irritability with potential epileptogenicity particularly in the right posterior quadrant.
In addition, background is diffusely slow indicative of a mild to moderate diffuse encephalopathy of non-specific etiology.
No electrographic seizures are present.
CXR ([**3-24**]):   Brief Hospital Course: 69F with Stage IV NSCLC with brain mets, recently completed C1 chemotherapy (cisplatin/Taxol?
