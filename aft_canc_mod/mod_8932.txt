The calf veins were not visualized due to extensive soft tissue edema.
In the region of the bruise along the medial aspect of the left thigh, there is diffuse subcutaneous soft tissue swelling, without a focal hematoma.
IMPRESSION: No DVT in the left lower extremity.
CXR ([**2143-2-28**]): Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Bibasilar opacities may represent combination of effusion and atelectasis, although underlying early consolidation cannot be excluded.
1.3-cm nodular opacity projecting over the right lung may represent nipple shadow, this can be confirmed with repeat with nipple markers.
Calcified left hilar node again seen.
Moderate to large hematoma involving the left gluteus medius and vastus lateralis and the subcutaneous soft tissues of the left proximal and mid-thigh without evidence of active extravasation.
Right retrocrural and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy of unclear clinical significance.

#) Anemia/Spontaneous L Thigh Hematoma: Patient's severe anemia with 28 point HCT decrease in 8 days was attributed to his large atraumatic hematoma.
Patient likely had been slowly bleeding for several days given the time course of his symptoms.
His anticoagulation status certainly contributed to this with his significantly elevated INR of 12.
He also has heme positive stool, though denied any dark or bloody stools.
There was no active extravasation on the CTA.
His CHADS2 score is 2 suggesting that he would benefit from continued anticoagulation when his bleed stabilizes- per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2903**] he will try to obtain prior authorization for dabigatran given his adverse event with warfarin.
#) Hypotension: Patient intially presented w/ hypotension which was attributed to his active bleed.
He did show signs of mild end organ damage w/ [**Last Name (un) **] which resolved with 4 units pRBCs and 2L IVF (see below for discussion of troponins) but did not require any pressor support.
This persistent relative hypotension in the setting of a stable hct was attributed to intravascular volume depletion as the patient developed significant LE edema as well as poor forward output in the setting of his frequent AF w/ rapid rates as high as 140s.
#) Elevated Cardiac Enzymes: Elevated trop in the setting of severe anemia on [**Last Name (un) **].
EKG was reassuring w/o any acute ischemic changes.
His troponin leak was attributed to demand ischemia in the setting of severe anemia.
Trops were trended and no signficant elevation.
#) acute on chronic systolic CHF: Patient w/ EF of 40-45% in [**2141**] with moderate to severe MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], lasix was held in setting of bleed as was his toprol XL.
By day of discharge, patient was showing signs of significant volume overload w/ [**1-27**]+ LE edema, though his lungs were relatively clear.
Patient w/ elevated wbc up from 9 last week with hypersegmented neutrophils and 68 neutrophils.
Patient did not show signs of active infection.
#) Afib, uncontrolled: Patient was tachycardic in the 100s and would shoot up to the 130s-140s with excitation or movement.
The risks of his leaving including further bleed, MI, stroke, fall and fracture, fatal arrhythmia were discussed and the patient demonstrated capacity in understanding these issues.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to the medical ICU with low blood pressures due to a bleed in your thigh.
Your INR was found to be high so your coumadin was stopped and you were transfused blood and clotting factors.
Please elevated your legs and minimize movement around the house to reduce of falls.
Monitor your legs for increased swelling or pain and if these symptoms occur please return to the hospital.
