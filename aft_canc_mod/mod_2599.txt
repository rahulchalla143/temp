Marked diffuse arterial calcification consistent with known vascular disease.
Small left pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: NEURO/PAIN: The patient was maintained on IV pain medication in the immediate post-operative period and transitioned to PO narcotic medication with adequate pain control on POD#0.
VASCULAR: The patient did well following his left lower extremity angiography and left PTA with anterior tibial stenting.
There was some concern for left lower extremity phlebitis by HOD#[**2-19**] and the patient continued leg elevation with ACE bandages, although NSAIDs were avoided given his on-going renal concerns.
He has a known diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.
On POD#0-1 he developed some nausea with asymptomatic, V2-3 ST depressions and EKG changes, for which Cardiology was consulted.
In the AM of POD#[**1-18**] he triggered by the nursing staff for hypotension and some sinus tachycardia, which was attributed to demand ischemia and volume depletion.
On discharge, he had no cardiac issues, his blood pressure had normalized with his beta-blocker, and his home Coumadin was continued for his atrial fibrillation.
The patient had no episodes of desaturation or pulmonary concerns.
The patient denied cough or respiratory symptoms.
The patient experienced no nausea or vomiting.
GENITOURINARY: The patient's urine output was closely monitored in the immediate post-operative period, but is minimal given his peritoneal dialysis needs.
He was continued on Coumadin in the post-op period given his need for anticoagulation related to atrial fibrillation.
A CT scan was obtained on [**2150-5-15**] to ensure there was no retroperitoneal bleeding to create the demand ischemia and cardiac issues.
His hematocrit stabilized and no further transfusions were required.
ID: The patient showed no signs of infection and remained afebrile in the post-op period.
Their white count was stable post-operatively and their incision was closely monitored for any evidence of infection or erythema.
The patient also had sequential compression boot devices in place during immobilization to promote circulation.
He was discharged with VNA services given his peritoneal dialysis and LLE dressing changes for his phlebitis.
