Right pronator drift and leg drift towards bed.
No hemorrhage.
Mild hypodensity within the left pons.
MRI [**7-13**]: Focus of increased signal on diffusion images in the upper pons on the left side could be due to acute infarct or T2 shine-through.
TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear mildly thickened but with good leaflet excursion.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
