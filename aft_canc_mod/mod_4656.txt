She reports subjective leg weakness (although no problems with ambulation), imbalance (with one fall).
She was empirically started on dexamethasone 4mg [**Hospital1 **] and had a stat MRI last evening which demonstrated a 14mm mass in the right frontal lobe with extensive edema and midline shift, along with a 4mm mass in the left occipital lobe and a 2mm mass in the superior right frontal lobe.
However, given multiple questions from family members and no dramatic improvement, the decision was made today for direct admission.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Her oncologic history began in [**2179-1-27**] when a right kidney mass was suspected on angiography (status post superficial femoral angioplasty and stenting).
In [**2179-6-29**], she underwent abdominal/pelvic CT which revealed a right kidney mass.
Chest CT in [**2179-7-30**] revealed 2 small pulmonary nodules suspicious for metastatic disease.
She underwent left lower lobe wedge resection in [**2179-8-29**] with pathology revealing renal cell carcinoma of clear cell type.
She underwent cardiac catheterization with a 90-95% stenosis of the proximal LAD noted.
She had a balloon angioplasty and stenting of the LAD.
She recovered well without cardiac issues and passed follow- up stress test to meet eligibility for the high-dose IL-2 select trial.
There also was slight interval increase in the size of the left hilar node.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Diabetes - Hyperlipidemia - Hypertension - Peripheral vascular disease, s/p R superficial femoral artery stenting x 2 - CAD, cardiac catheterization revealing a 95-99% proximal stenosis of the LAD; s/p PCI stenting in [**2181-3-29**]   Social History: She continues to live in [**Hospital1 392**] and will occasionally help out at her relatives' Chinese restaurant answering phones.

4-mm left occipital lobe enhancing lesion with surrounding edema, 2 mm right superior frontal lobe enhancing lesion.
Overall, findings consistent with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
CXR ([**12-5**]): IMPRESSION: No evidence of osseous metastasis.
Multiple similar size pulmonary nodules consistent with metastatic disease.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] ([**12-7**]): IMPRESSION: Limited pre-op WAND study, for resection, demonstrating the dominant 15-mm right frontovertex enhancing lesion with large zone of associated vasogenic edema, additional punctiform enhancing lesion in the right frontal corona radiata, at the dorsal margin of the edematous zone, and 5.5-mm enhancing lesion with adjacent vasogenic edema in the left occipital pole.
CT Head ([**12-8**]): IMPRESSION: Expected postsurgical changes status post right frontal craniotomy and lesion resection.
No large intracranial hemorrhage.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] ([**12-9**]): Pending  Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 63year old woman with a history of renal cell carcinoma with known metastasis to the occipital lobe/T6 vertebrae and lungs, CAD s/p DES to proximal LAD on [**4-5**], DM, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented with left arm pain and outpatient MRI head on [**12-3**] showing a 14 mm enhancing lesion in the right frontal lobe with extensive surrounding edema and mild shift of midline structures, 4-mm left occipital lobe enhancing lesion with surrounding edema, and 2 mm right superior frontal lobe enhancing lesion.
Pre-op MRI WAND study was limited, but showed the dominant 15-mm right frontovertex enhancing lesion with large zone of associated vasogenic edema, additional punctiform enhancing lesion in the right frontal corona radiata, at the dorsal margin of the edematous zone, and 5.5-mm enhancing lesion with adjacent vasogenic edema in the left occipital pole.
She underwent a MRI and CT scan demonstrated a T6 metastasis with involvement of the [**5-5**] foramen.
She was determined to be symptomatic and at risk for instability.
Post operatively she was full strength, her incision was clean and dry she tolerated a regular diet and was voiding without difficulty.
She was noted to have a bump in creatinine and renal was consulted she was treated with fluid and her diovan and bactrim were dc'd.
