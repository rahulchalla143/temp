Also noted to have RBBB on EKG, but no STT changes per ED.
Past Medical History: most per phone conversation with rehab nurse: DM II HTN COPD (on 3-4L NC O2 per pt) CHF CAD ARF Hemorrhagic cystitis Skin ulcers   Social History: has 4 sons, closest in [**Name (NI) **], states it is not a closely knit family, does not want any of them to be primary decision makers.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Temp 98.4, BP 150/54, HR 112, RR 26, O2 sat 95% on 4L NC GENERAL: elderly, obese male, mild respiratory distress, awaker, fully oriented, coherent HEENT: OP clear, anicteric, L nares with some fresh bleeding NECK: full neck, unable to examine for JVD CARDIOVASCULAR: regular tachycardic, no murmurs LUNGS: diffuse wheezes, no crackles ABDOMEN: obese, non-distended, non-tender BACK: large area of erythema, macerated skin, and ulceration starting at coccyx EXTREMITIES: NEURO: AAOx3, moves all extremities   Pertinent Results: EKG: irregular, tachycardic, RBBB, no ST changes or T wave changes (same as previous read at prior hospitalization) .
There is likely a left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
No large pneumothorax is identified.
Evaluation is limited by patient positioning and body habitus.
There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, and basilar atelectasis, unchanged compared to the previous study.
No interval change .
No evidence of DVT seen within the right common femoral, proximal superficial femoral, and popliteal veins.
No intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage is clearly identified.
There is no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
No obvious intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Note added at attending review: There is an incompletely visualized expansile mass in the left maxillary alveolar ridge and there is a partially calcified mass in the left frontal sinus.
Ct scan of the facial bones suggested.
CT Sinus, prelim read: 2.4 x 1.4 cm expansile mass in the left maxillary alveolar ridge.
There is thinning of the cortical margins and areas of focal dehiscense.
The findings may be consistent with an ameloblastoma.
Partially calcified mass in the left frontal sinus.
Right maxillary and ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or  color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The right ventricular  cavity is mildly dilated.
The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

No previous available ABG values, however initial ABG with partly compensated respiratory acidosis and component of newly worsened hypercarbia c/w COPD exacerbation.
Pt became progressively sedated over the course of HOD #1 -> continued on BIPAP, pCO2 trended up to 76 (ABG 7.31/76/154).
Placed on ceftriaxone, azithromycin for cough, productive of yellow sputum, recent pneumonia, finished a course of this in-house.
refused further positive pressure ventilation, BiPAP, or intubation.
continued to have elevated PCO2 levels, which peaked at 95 and then trended down to 70s.
had no further sedation or AMS.
CHF exacerbation - EF 55-60% on TTE, evidence of diastolic dysfunction (see results above).
Difficult to evaluate fluid status on CXR although he did have marked LE edema on exam, and elevated BNP suggested CHF exacerbation.
# CAD - elevated troponin on presentation suggestive of previous ischemic event, trended down.
Noted to have allergic reaction to heparin in past, appears most likely had thrombocytopenia?, but HIT negative.
# HTN - continued losartan, metoprolol.
was beginning to develop a contraction alkalosis from lasix).
Elected not to anti-coagulate given acute illness, bleeding risk, though this should be considered in the future.
# Mass L maxillary ridge- this was noted incidentally on Head CT performed in MICU.
It was followed up with a CT sinus, the prelim read of which showed a mass concerning for ameloblastoma.
ENT was consulted and recommended outpatient work-up by OMFS and ENT (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] from ENT reviewed imaging and felt that it was c/w frontal sinus osteoma).
# UTI - treated with ceftriaxone and then cefepime in-house and discharged on the rest of a 12 day course (see urine culture above) .
# Decubitus ulcer - no clear cellulitis, but given past colonization with MRSA, elevated WBC, initially covered with vancomycin, stopped after cx's negative x48 hrs, afebrile.
# FEN: cardiac diet .
* Code status: DNR/DNI, no non-invasive ventilation per several discussions with pt.
