He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED in the midst of a RBC transfusion when he developed sudden shortness of breath that was interpreted as a possible transfusion reaction.
He appears to have severe COPD caused by an extensive smoking history.
He has poor exercise tolerance which has only worsened in the preceding months.
He recently underwent TTE evaluation of his exercise intolerance, at which point a relatively large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology was seen.
He was admitted to the CCU [**9-2**]- [**9-6**] and underwent pericardiocentesis, which revealed malignant cells.
His fatigue and poor exercise tolerance persisted.
Midway through the transfusion, he developed worsening SOB and increased RR.
In the ED, he was found to be tachycardic and tachypneic.
A bedside echo was done which showed no pericardial effusion per the ED read.
He describes frequent episodes similar to his breathlessness on transfusion, which often pass after coughing or spitting.
He notes no recent couging or cold-like smpyotms, no sore throat, fevers, chills, chest pains or pressure.
He has lower extremity edema but no PND, orthopnea.
No recent F/C.
In the midst of our interview, he had the urge to urinate and abruptly stood to use his urinal- he developed respiratory distress with saturations dipping to the 80s and tachypnea to 50.

ACUTE HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: --PNEUMONIA and ACUTE SYSTOLIC CHF: He developed acute shortness of breath early into his blood transfusion which he was receiving for anemia.
Transfusion reaction/TRALI was initially suspected though he lacked severe pulmonary edema or hypoxia to support this diagnosis.
He related numerous similar episodes of shortness of breath at home and related a progressive worsening of his overall respiratory status and exercise stamina over the preceding months.
His CXR showed mild edema and RLL haziness.
Widespread wheezing prompted treatment for COPD exacerbation.
The cause of his decompensation was felt to be multifactorial.
He had a trop of 1.00 on admission with flat CK/MB, but new LAD-distributed TWI on EKG, and new onset systolic dysfunction with EF to 40-45% on TTE (new since last month).
A cardiac event could have potentially caused his deterioration and CHF exacerbation.
Pneumonia was possible based on his RLL infiltrate, and he was treated for HCAP with vanco/cefepime/levaquin.
Sputum culture revealed commensal resp flora and sparse GNR.
He was started on nebs and steroids for possible COPD exacerbation as well,though these were quickly tapered due to suspicion for more of a CHF etiology.
His steroids were discontinued on [**2132-10-13**] as the etiology of his SOB was thought to be related to pulmonary edema and a possible pneumonia rather than a COPD exacerbation.
On the day prior to discharge, cefipime was discontinued as the patient had remained afebrile and without leukocytosis; prednisone was also discontinued since COPD flare appears to not have been the primary etiology of SOB and his symptoms were resolving.
2)NSTEMI: His troponin elevation to 1.00 is without any similar MB or CK elevation.
He had some nonspecific lateral T wave changes, but no chst pain or pressure to suggest ACS.
TTE revealed new onset systolic dysfunction with EF 45-50%.
Based on EKG and echo data, there was a possible partial occlusion in the LAD and that the patient may benefit from elective cathetrization.
However, based on the absence of symptoms and the comorbidities in the patient, oncology, medicine and the patient's family were in agreement with medical management.
An EKG was essentially unchanged and troponins showed a continued downward trend.
ANEMIA: HCT to 25 of unclear source, though inflammatory disease from malignancy  or myelosupression from chemo are both possible.
Though his hematrocrit trended downwards in the days prior to discharge, a transfusion was not thought to be necessary by cardiology (goal 25).
HYPERTENSION: The patient had recently been taken off his dose of 20 mg linisnopril QAM due to low blood pressures.

You were admitted to the medical ICU after presenting to the emergency department for acute onset shortness of breath during a blood transfusion.
A reaction to the blood transfusion itself was ruled out.
A chest xray showed possible signs of a pneumomia and you were started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
It is possible that yoru COPD was contributing to your shortness of breath and you were also given a steroid as well as your usual inhalers.
In the MICU you had a second acute episode of shortness of breath that was not responsive to oxygen.
Because of your worsening respiratory status you were intubated (given a breathing tube).
An echo cardiogram showed that you had a new onset of congestive heart failure (CHF).
It is likely that your shortness of breath was due to too much volume backing up in your lungs.
However, along with your oncolgy team, it was determined to be best to try to manage your heart disease with medical management.
Your steroids were stopped on the medical floor and the medicines for your pneumonia were narrowed to treat the most likely organism.
