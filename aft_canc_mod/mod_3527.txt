His postoperative course was complicated by a bronchopleural fistula and Serratia VAP for which he took cipro x 14 days.
On [**2101-1-13**], he was re-admitted with R empyema and partial dehiscence of the chest wall patch.
He then underwent bronchoscopy which demonstrated thin secretions in the trachea and proximal b/l bronchi.

Physical Exam: 98.5  73  120/63  16  100% AC 0.6/450 x 14/5 Gen: intubated, arousable to voice CVS: RRR Pulm: coarse breath sounds diffusely, CTs with purulent output, incisions c/d/i Abd: soft, NT, ND, +BS Ext: no c/c/e   Pertinent Results: WBC 10.6, Hct 24.5, plt 313; Na 142, K 5.6, Cl 109, bicarb 30, BUn 31, Cr 1.4, glu 146, Ca 8.5, Mg 1.6, P 5.4; PT 12.8, INR 1.1; ALT 15, AST 13, AP 143, t.bili 0.2, LDH 185, [**Doctor First Name **] 57, lip 30; vanc 32.8; lactate 0.7; 7.21/80/161/34/1  CXR: largely unchanged from [**2-14**] and [**2-21**], persistent pleural effusions  Bronchoscopy: thin secretions in trachea and b/l proximal bronchi   Brief Hospital Course: Neuro: patient was kept under light sedation for comfort while intubated with propofol.
His pain was initially controlled with prn fentanyl.
We attempted to keep his sedation minimal and only adminstered when he was agitated or requiring sedation for a procedure.
On [**2101-4-28**], head CT was obtained, showing marked predominantly vasogenic edema spread diffusely within both cerebral hemispheres, right cerebellum, and possibly within the brainstem with at least two focal hyperdense lesions noted within the left periventricular white matter and left basal ganglia.
These findings were consistent with widespread metastatic disease.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm without evidence of ischemic.
He was given prn doses of hydralazine and diltiazem for HTN or tachcardia.
Electrophysiology consult was obtained, and bradycardia was thought to be due to excess beta blockade.
He was found to have secretions in the trachea and b/l main stem bronchi, BAL was performed.
A CT chest was done which showed a moderate left pleural effusion.
He was rebronched on [**2101-2-26**] for RLL colapse and found to have a mucus plug and moderate to thick secretions in the RML and RLL bronchi.
His BAL grew out Serratia that was pansensitive.
Throughout his admission, patient had heavy secretions, requiring frequent tracheal suctioning and chest PT, as well as intermittent bronchoscopy.
Pt required brief transfer to ICU for hypoxia due to mucus plugging [**4-16**] but transferred back to floor the following day.
Renal: Pt was found to be in prerenal azotemia and acute tubular necrosis, peaking at Cr 4.6.
ID: Patient was found to have pneumonia, BAL growing out Serratia marcescens on admission.
During this admission, another episode of pneumonia was documented w/ BAL growing out Serratia, Acinetobacter and Enterobacter.
Pt went into PEA arrest but converted to unstable narrow complex tachycardia after epinephrine.
Given hemodynamic instability, pt was cardioverted x1 200J w/ return of sinus rhythm.
During the morning of [**2101-4-29**], pt was noted to have dilated R pupil w/o corneal or gag reflex.
STAT head CT showed uncal herniation and cerebellar tonsil herniation.
