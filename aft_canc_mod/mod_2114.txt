Transfer is requested for ongoing management of diastolic CHF.
On evaluation in the SICU before transfer, patient was sleeping but arousable, complaining of old back pain and of constipation.

Physical Exam: Physical exam on admission: Gen: obese, deconditioned, pain with movement of extremities.
Extrem: B LE edema Neuro: Mental status: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
Motor: Patient with severe bilateral wasting of muscles of hand.
New interval C5-C6 anterior fusion with intervertebral disc spacer, no immediate hardware complication.
Post-surgical changes in the soft tissue with subcutaneous emphysema mostly in the right submandibular region.
Mass at C1 level with associated cord compression consistent with known meningioma better described on recent MRI.
Soft tissue thickening at the right lung apex, not fully characterized on the current CT.
New interval left frontal subdural hyperdense extra-axial fluid collection with new interval subdural subfalcine extra-axial hyperdense fluid collection, indicating subdural hemorrhage, likely post-surgical but clinical correlation recommended.
Pneumocephalus with distribution at the basilar cisterns, mostly at the left sylvian fissure, and bifrontally at the falx, likely post-surgical, and additionally in the posterior fossa near the site of the occipital craniotomy.
Post-surgical changes with left craniotomy at the occipital bone and laminectomy at C1 with subcutaneous emphysema and hyperdense products, likely post-surgical.
Soft tissue hyperdensity at the posterior parietal, occipital soft tissue region, could be small post-surgical hematoma.
# C-spine MRI [**2176-8-31**]: Status post resection of C1 extradural tumor, likely meningioma with expectorated postoperative changes.
No large intraspinal hematoma seen.
There remains some persistent narrowing of the spinal canal at C1 level with indentation on the posterior aspect of the spinal cord.
Mild spinal cord atrophy could be secondary to chronic myelomalacia.
# LE arterial Duplex [**2176-9-3**]: The peak systolic velocity involving the native right common femoral artery is 104 cm/sec.
PATHOLOGY: # C1 tumor [**2176-8-30**]: Cervical medullary junction tumor: Meningioma, psammomatous subtype (WHO Grade I).
The tumor is composed of meningothelial cells with numerous psammoma bodies and collagen deposition with no typical features or mitotic activity.
Brief Hospital Course: 55-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2, severe peripheral [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] disease, CAD, diastolic CHF, atrial fibrillation, presented for planned anterior cervical decompression at C5-6 and removal of C1 meningioma.
# Cervical myelopathy and meningioma: Patient underwent anterior cervical decompression and C5/6 fusion on [**2176-8-29**] and removal of C1 meningioma on [**2176-8-30**].
He developed a small subdural hematoma on [**2176-8-30**] with no new neurologic symptom.
Clopidogrel, for recent left SFA stent, was restarted on POD#5, [**2176-9-4**], and warfarin, for atrial fibrillation, is to be restarted on [**2176-9-9**].
Of note, there was some concern that he had developed LE weakness after his procedure, but after re-evaluation with the neurosurgery team they felt that his strength in his legs were his baseline and this was not a change.
# Diastolic heart failure: The patient experienced an acute exacerbation of his diastolic heart failure likely secondary to significant fluid administration during surgery.
# Peripheral [**Date Range **] disease.
# Atrial fibrillation: The patient was not in atrial fibrillation during his hospitalization.
# DM II.
# Pressure ulcers.
The patient has a 2x2cm right heel full thickness ulcer that was without odor or drainage.

Pressure ulcer care was performed by repositioning, skin cleansing and conditioner application, and cover with ABD and kerlex.
# Chronic pain syndrome: The patient was continued on his home regimen of dilaudid 4mg PO Q3H:prn  # Chronic hyponatremia.
The patient had a history of chronic hyponatremia although his sodium remained between 130-140 during this admission.
