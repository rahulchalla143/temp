Admission Date:  [**2128-8-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-8-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-2-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 473**] Chief Complaint: Pancreatic head mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Whipple procedure, [**2128-8-3**]  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 87581**] was a 65 year old woman with no significant past medical history who was well until approximately one month prior to admission when she presented with jaundice and weight loss to an OSH.
She had a CT with visualization of the stricture as well as with dilation of both the pancreatic and common bile ducts.
She was subsequently referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for EUS with FNA of the CBD and pancreas however given her increased jaundice and pruritis it was thought that her current plastic stent in the CBD may not be providing adequate biliary drainage.
Since her discharge she continued to have persistent pruritis.
Repeat lab tests showed increased bilirubin (from 25 to 30).
She had insomnia secondary to the pruritis and urinary frequency.
Hypertension 2.
Ectopic pregnancy 3.
Smokes 14 cigarettes per day for many years; occasional alcohol.
The operation proceeded without complication.
Her narcotics were removed from her epidural and overall pain regimen.
Lab results showed significantly elevated LFTs -- ALT/AST 2229/2919 up from 231/336 the day prior.
A UTI was suspected based on UA dipstick and ciprofloxacin was started but stopped the next day after the urine cx returned no growth and no clinical signs of infection.
Over the course of the next few days, the patient was less agitated but her delirium was persistent with continued confusion, nonsensical speech and behavior and lack of orientation.
She tolerated all advances with no emesis, no apparent nausea or abdominal bloating.
On the evening of POD 7, the patient was intermittently alert and oriented with markedly less confusion and able to hold a sensible conversation with family members as well as members of the healthcare team.
This waxed and waned into POD 9 where she was clear most of the day, alert and oriented to person, time and place though continued to have intermittent nonsensical thought and speech.
She had several loose bowel movements, sample sent for c.diff and started on empiric flaygl therapy.
Oxycodone was thereafter removed from her medication list and replaced solely with tylenol.She had fewer loose bowel movements.
On the morning of POD 11, Mrs. [**Known lastname 87581**] was mentating, alert but not entirely oriented but interspersed with nonsensical speech.
Her physical exam was unchanged: the incision was clean, dry and intact, her abdomen soft, non-tender and with minimal distention, unchanged from prior exams.
In the early afternoon, after lunch, Mrs. [**Known lastname 87581**] had a loose bowel movement and was being cleaned by the nursing staff.
She was actively coded for 10 minutes prior to regaining a pulse with chest compressions performed throughout, receiving three shocks, epinephrine, bicarbonate and vasopressin.
CT scan done that night showed a large intraperitoneal bleed, mostly clotted, with no active extravasation of contrast.
Initially her bladder pressures were monitored frequently to monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome due to an on-going bleed.
The pressors were titrated accordingly to maintain increased renal perfusion and urine output.
She had some low blood pressure issues (SBPs in the 80s) and low urine output (20 cc/hr, Cr bumped suddenly to 1.7 from 0.6) for which she received a IVF boluses including both crystalloid and albumin, eventually had pressors restarted for a short period of time then dc'd after her toes were found to be blue then restarted after her toe ischemia resolved and pressures dropped again, this time with limited change in color of the toes.
Her fluid overload status continued to worsen by both clinical (edema, decreased pO2 on ABG) and radiologic measures (worsening CXR).
Her Cr remained elevated at 1.8 on [**8-27**].
Initially, she retracted her extremities in response to pain but this disappeared over the first day in the ICU.
She was thought to have had some seizure-like activity the morning of the 26th ( morning after the PEA arrest) which resolved when treated with midazolam.
Neurology was consulted and suggested a head CT to rule out a brain hemmorrhage which could have been an additional etiology leading to the PEA arrest.
They also noted that while some of the decreased alertness and activity may be the result of the poor liver function and its inability to clear sedatives, the lack of return to function two days post was a poor prognostic indicator.
They additionally recommended a monitoring EEG to rule out seizure activity.
The NCSE continued on EEG for the next several days, ultimately ceasing in NCSE activity by [**2128-8-20**] and showing slight improvement on exam but with no wakefulness and continued guarded prognosis.
[**8-22**] repeat CT Head showed no interval changes and no evidence of hemorrhage or hypoxia.
EEG monitoring, however, showed a burst suppression pattern which was thought to be an indicator of poor prognosis.
Neurology noted slim chances at improvement and suggested that her poor neurologic function could not be accounted for by metabolic or on-going multi-organ failure issues, possibly the result of ischemic insult to the brain.
Her poor prognosis was explained and the family agreed to a plan of DNR but continued life-sustaining medications until further discussions with the rest of the family for comfort-measures-only and withdrawal-of-care.
Of note, on an ID front, Mrs. [**Known lastname 87581**] was started on flagyl on [**8-14**] for empiric therapy of loose stools thought to be C. Diff.
A BAL done on [**2128-8-15**] grew coag + staph and Moraxella.
Pancreatic head carcinoma 2.
Liver failure 4.
Renal insufficiency 5.
