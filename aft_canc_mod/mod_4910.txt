Prior to this he had been having coughing fit and wife found him slumped on the couch with rhythmic jerking of hands but did not respond to voice but could squeeze his hands.
Head CT was obtained at OSH which was unchanged from scan [**10-31**] when mass initially discovered.
Has not been getting chemo but anemic and thrombocytopenic.
ED was not comfortable w/ doing LP given mass effect (though recommended by his neuro-oncologist) and thrombocytopenia to 64 (guideline is 80).
He was not given empiric Abx because he was afebrile, no leukocytosis and had a good reason for sz other than meningitis.
Past Medical History: # Mestatastic clear cell renal CA s/p R nephrectomy 3 yrs ago # Prostate CA s/p prostatectomy # HTN # DM # HL # Anxiety # GERD # Gout   Social History: Married.
He has no siblings.
Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION: General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema  PHYSICAL EXAM ON DISCHARGE: Vital signs: Tc 98.2 Tmax 99.1 BP 118/74 (118-146/70-82) HR 63 (63-70) O2 sat 100% RA FS 208-279 GEN: AOx3, NAD HEENT: PERRL.
Pulm: CTAB, no wheezes/crackles Abd: BS+, soft, NT, no rebound/guarding, no HSM, no [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign Extremities: wwp, no edema.
Contracture of right hand (chronic for 10 years) Skin: no rashes or bruising Neuro: A & O x 3, slow to speak, CNs II-XII intact.
ET tube terminates 5 cm from the carina without evidence of pneumothorax.
There is prominence of hilar and mediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature, which may be reflective of increased pulmonary vascular pressure.
Retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis or aspiration; however, superimposed infection cannot be entirely excluded.
CXR (PA & LAT) [**2144-1-26**]: IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:  The lateral view shows a wedge-shaped area of opacity in one of the lower lungs, could be a composite shadow of anterior spinal osteophytes and large lower lung vessels.
Two other regions of abnormality are the suggestion of 11-mm wide right upper lobe nodule at the level of the first anterior interspace and fullness in the right lower paratracheal mediastinum, which could be adenopathy or fat.
All these issues would be resolved with routine chest CT.  Heart is top normal size, there is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 yo M w/ renal cell CA to the brain p/w new onset seizure.
S/p seizure: Pt presented with new onset seizure at home.
Pt had mass lesion in brain and had been recently taken off seizure prophylaxis.
Lumbar puncture was not performed as he was afebrile with no leukocytosis and because he had thrombocytopenia (plts 60s).
He was placed back on keppra and dexamethasone and extubated on [**2144-1-25**] with no complications.
He did not have further seizures in the hospital.
Renal cell carcinoma: Pt with renal cell carcinoma metastatic to brain.
He was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma in [**6-/2141**] and was s/p right nephrectomy [**8-/2141**] with recently diagnosed left frontal brain mass.
Pt had chronic mild right hemiparesis, anomia, and dysphasia but no new neurologic deficits.
He had recently completed keppra course and had been on dexamethasone taper prior to presenting with new onset seizure.
?Aspiration: CXR on admission showed retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis vs. aspiration but could not rule out PNA.
Pt had low grade temp 100.2 upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED but was afebrile with no leukocytosis throughout remainder of hospital course.
Repeat cxr showed an opacity that was read as possible composite shadow of osteophytes and lung vessels; two other regions of fullness were interpreted as adenopathy or fat.
Pt also reportedly had difficulty swallowing at ICU and was put on thickened liquid diet.
Normocytic Anemia: Pt with normocytic anemia, Hct 30-35 during hospital admission.
Given anemia in conjunction with thrombocytopenia, SPEP and UPEP were sent to rule out multiple myeloma.
Hct remained stable and pt had no evidence of bleeding.
He had rare hyperglycemia to 400s while on dexamethasone which improved by time of discharge.
