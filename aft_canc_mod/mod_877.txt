Admission Date:  [**2167-7-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2167-7-21**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: AICD firing  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardioversion with sedation   History of Present Illness: He presented to [**Hospital6 17032**] [**7-13**] with nausea, vomitting, chills and stable VTach on ECG.
1/4 bottles were positive for E. coli.
CXR showed an early right base infiltrate.
He returned to the NVMC ED late that evening due to 9 episodes of ACID firing.
On his arrival with EMS he had witnessed VTach and appropriate AICD shock.
Patient states that there was no "warning" and felt well before ACID firing.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Dyslipidemia, Hypertension, s/p left carotid endarterectomy, CAD s/p MI '[**54**] 2.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: chronic renal insufficiency (baseline Cr 1.3), AAA s/p endovascular repair in [**2163**], s/p cholecysectomy, BPH s/p TURP, chronic anemia (early myelodysplasia).
-Tobacco history: nonsmoker -ETOH: 1 glass of wine daily -Illicit drugs: denies  Family History: no history of sudden/early cardiac death.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND EXTREMITIES: warm, no edema noted PULSES: distal 2+ pulses b/l   Pertinent Results: [**2167-7-17**] 12:55AM   WBC-6.7 RBC-2.71* HGB-9.8* HCT-29.4* MCV-109* MCH-36.1* MCHC-33.2 RDW-15.8* [**2167-7-17**] 12:55AM   NEUTS-78.2* LYMPHS-15.8* MONOS-4.7 EOS-0.8 BASOS-0.5 [**2167-7-17**] 12:55AM   PLT COUNT-191 [**2167-7-17**] 12:55AM   GLUCOSE-123* UREA N-40* CREAT-1.6* SODIUM-138 POTASSIUM-4.1 CHLORIDE-103 TOTAL CO2-23 ANION GAP-16 [**2167-7-17**] 12:55AM   CK(CPK)-61 [**2167-7-17**] 12:55AM   cTropnT-0.05* [**2167-7-17**] 12:55AM   PT-23.7* PTT-28.3 INR(PT)-2.3* [**2167-7-17**] 03:45AM URINE  BLOOD-NEG NITRITE-NEG PROTEIN-NEG GLUCOSE-NEG KETONE-NEG BILIRUBIN-NEG UROBILNGN-NEG PH-5.0 LEUK-NEG [**2167-7-17**] 05:45PM   TSH-1.4 .
CXR [**2167-7-17**] No pneumonia or CHF.
CXR [**2167-7-19**] In comparison with study of [**7-17**], there is little change.
Again there is the vague suggestion of a right upper lung nodule that could well represent progressive scarring.
Blood Cx [**7-13**] at NVMC: [**1-19**] bottle (+) for E coli; sensative to TMP/SMX, Amox/clavulonate, amp/sulbactam, cipro and levo; resistant to amp, cetriaxone, cefzolin, and cefuroxime   Brief Hospital Course: 89yo M with AICD placed s/p VFib arrest, CAD s/p CABG, and AFib recently d/c from OSH after being treated for E. coli bacteremia who presented after multiple AICD firings.
3 sets of cardiac enzymes have been unremarkable and there were no new ECG changes.
It was suspected that episodes of AFib were triggering VTach and thus the AICD shocks were appropriate.
# E. coli bateremia: Switched from Levaquin to Unasyn to avoid risk of QT prolongation.
Right lung process noted on CXR is unlikely to be a source of a gram (-) bacteremia.
Intrabdominal process was suspected at OSH, but no abdominal imaging done.
Called micro lab at OSH and E. coli was sensative to ertapenam.
# amiodorone - Mr. [**Known lastname **] has had multiple IV doses of amio as well as his home po dose over the past few days.
# CAD: S/p CABG.
No c/o chest pain or SOB.
No increase incardiac enzymes as noted above.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) **] Nursing Services  Discharge Diagnosis: Recurrent Ventricular tachycardia successfully terminated by ICD Atrial Fibrillation E.Coli bacterimia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
