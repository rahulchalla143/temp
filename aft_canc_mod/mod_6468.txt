He states that he had diarrhea, stood up  and became lightheaded and then had a loss of consciousness.
The fall itself was unwitnessed so it is uncertain if there was a head strike.
The patient denies headache, numbness, tingling, weakness vision, or hearing deficit.
He states that he has neck pain with range of motion especially chin to chest and has pain on the back of his right neck and right shoulder.
He sat up on the stretcher began sweating, became nauseous, was seen to have rolled his eyes back in his head and was unresponsive.
His wife states that he has a n adrenal insufficiency and is prone to dehydration.
Past Medical History: lung and prostate CA Recent Hyperkalemia I with Stent placement (on ASA 325 and Pradaxa) adrenal insufficiency Hypertension Hypercholesteremia syncope frequent falls   Social History: live at home with wife  Family History: non contributory  Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM: O: T: 97  BP:113/ 70    HR:18    R:18    O2Sats:100% Gen: comfortable, NAD.
HEENT: A traumatic Pupils:         EOMs: intact Neck:painful range of motion on chin to chest, + pain on palpation right neck and right scapula Extrem: Warm and well-perfused.
No dysarthria.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Pupilary irregularity again noted in right eye, otherwise non focal exam.
This appearance is nonspecific and the differential includes a Preliminary Reporthyperdense metastatic lesion, although focal hemorrhage is not excluded given reported recent fall.
A possible second area of hyperdensity in region of Preliminary Reportleft cingulate gyrus is likely due to similar process, although small Preliminary Reportsubarachnoid blood is not excluded.
MRI with/without contrast Brain [**2133-8-4**] One and possibly two metastatic lesions in the brain without significant perilesional edema.
MRI without contrast Neck [**2133-8-4**] Motion artifact degrades the quality and decreases the sensitivity of this study.
There is abnormal increased signal within the posterior paraspinal soft tissues, including the interspinous ligaments, concerning for ligamentous injury/sprain with edema.
There is mild disc space narrowing at C5-C6 and C6-C7.
At C2-C3, there is a small central disc bulge without significant spinal canal narrowing.
At C3-C4, there is a posterior disc bulge asymmetric to the left resulting in mild spinal canal narrowing.
There is mild right and moderate left neural foraminal narrowing due to uncovertebral and facet joint osteophytes.
At C4-C5, there are posterior intervertebral osteophytes without significant spinal canal narrowing.
There are moderate to severe bilateral neural foramina due to uncovertebral and facet joint osteophytes.
At C5-C6, there is a left paracentral disc bulge and intervertebral osteophyte deforming the anterior cord, resulting in moderate-to-severe spinal canal narrowing at this level.
The left neural foramen is also narrowed due to a combination of uncovertebral and posterior osteophytes.
At C6-C7, there are intervertebral posterior osteophytes and a disc bulge deforming the anterior cord.
There is also bilateral mild-to-moderate neural foraminal narrowing due to the disc bulge extending into both neural foramina.
At C7-T1, there is no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.
Within the limitations of this study, likely interspinous ligamentous injury/sprain with edema as described.
Moderate-to-severe spinal canal narrowing at C5-C6.
Multilevel spondylosis of the cervical spine as described  Echocardiogram [**2133-8-5**] No structural cardiac cause of syncope identified.
Poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild dilatation of the aortic root and ascending aorta.
Carotid Ultra sound:  Preliminary report of your ultrasound does not show any stenosis or occlusion of your carotid arteries.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 64 year old man on Aspirin 325 mg and Pradaxa with history of coronary artery disease with stenting, prostate cancer metastatic to bone and adrenals, syncope, and frequent falls who was in his bathroom today when he experiences a syncopal fall.
The patient had a Head CT that was consistent with left parietal hemorhage vs mass.
At that time, the patient denied headache, numbness, tingling,weakness vision, or hearing deficit.
A MRI of the brain with and without contrast was ordered and showed "One and possibly two metastatic lesions in the brain without significant perilesional edema and a large mass in the right masticator space, possibly representing metastatic disease.
He stated that he has neck pain with range of motion especially chin to chest and has pain on the back of his right neck and right shoulder.
A CT of the neck at [**Hospital 79882**] Hospital was negative for fracture.
Given the patients painful range of motion and recent fall a MRI of the cervical spine was ordered to rule out ligamentous injury.
The test was consistent wit abnormal increased signal within the posterior paraspinal soft tissues, including the interspinous ligaments, concerning for ligamentous injury/sprain with edema.
At that time he sat up on the stretcher began sweating, became nauseous, was seen to have rolled his eyes back in his head and was unresponsive.
His wife states that he has adrenal insufficiency and is prone to dehydration.
The patient was given two 500 cc normal saline bolus and a syncope work up was ordered which included EKG, craotid ultrasound, echocardiogram and cardiac enzymes.
The patient was admitted to the ICU for monitoring  On [**8-5**] the patient had an echocardiogram which only showed moderate MR with an EF of 55%.
His carotid ultrasounds showed no stenois.
His orthostatics were checked and showed no BP lability.
LeVETiracetam 500 mg PO BID RX *levetiracetam 500 mg 1 tablet(s) by mouth twice a day Disp #*60 Tablet Refills:*2   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: metastatic brain lesions Orthostatic hypotension Falls NOS   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital after a loss of consciousness and fall.
An MRI of your brain revealed what appears to be metastatic lesions in the brain.
You also had tests to evaluated the cause of your loss of consciousness.
Your echocardiogram showed only moderate mitral regurgitation and your carotid dopplers did not reveal any stenosis.
You should continue your follow up with your Cardiologist and Endocrinologist for further evaluation of your falls and sudden losses of conciousness.
Followup Instructions: You will be contact[**Name (NI) **] by [**Hospital3 **] radiation oncology for radiation planning.
