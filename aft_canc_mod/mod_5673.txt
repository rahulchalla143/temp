Although a left-sided pleural effusion is probably reduced, there is increasing parenchymal opacification with volume loss at the left base, which may be associated with increased extent of infection.
CT Chest [**2107-7-30**]: While there has been improvement in left-sided moderate pleural effusion, there are now confluent opacities at the left lower lobe suggestive of progression of multifocal pneumonia in this region.
Otherwise, there is stable appearance of consolidation involving the left upper lobe, left lower lobe, and lingula with little change in the appearance of left upper lobe cavitary lesion.
Advancement of disease, marked by increased size of a hepatic lesion and an increase in the lytic components of known osseous disease.
No new metastatic foci identified.
Likely unchanged metastatic disease to the kidneys, comparison is difficult given contrast timing.
Left lower lobe consolidation with volume loss consistent with known pneumonia.

Patient presented with a new LLL consolidation on CT despite recently completing treatment course of meropenem.
Aspiration event was likely given his vocal cord dysfunction.
He was evaluated by pulmonary and a bronchoscopy was performed on [**8-1**] which showed a large amount of secretions but no obstruction.
Pt with supplemental O2 requirements [**8-11**] and CXR noted to have increase in LLL PNA.
# [**Month/Day (4) 9036**] care: Pall care consult initiated at request of pt's sister, [**Name (NI) 66110**].
# Cachexia/malnutrition: Patient continued to have poor PO intake for multiple reasons.
He has difficulty and pain with swallowing with known vocal cord dysfunction, pain in his back that makes it uncomfortable for him to sit up and eat, and overall poor appetite.
CT abdomen showed possible progression of cancer which may indicated decreased response to tarceva.
# Anemia: Hct remained chronically low in low 20s.
There were no signs of frank bleeding and Hct remained stable.
# Left vocal cord paralysis: Noted on last admission.
The patient was transferred to the ICU overnight s/p L vocal cord injection with poor abduction of R cord and concern for possible airway obstruction secondary to b/l medialization of the cords.
Chronic issues: # Dysphagia/Odynophagia: Likely secondary to radiation therapy and tumor.
However, given long-standing dysphagia that pt reported was worsening, GI was curbsided regarding possibility of upper endoscopy.
Pt ended up getting G tube as opposed to PEG so endoscopy was not pursued to evaluate esophagus for cause of odynophagia.
Repeat CT abdomen/pelvis showed advancement of disease in liver and lytic components.
He was continued on erlotinib for his lung cancer and keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
Pt opted for [**Name (NI) **] measures with residential hospice.
# Back Pain: Chronic.
Likely due to axial metastatic lesions.
