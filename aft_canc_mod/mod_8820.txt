Admission Date:  [**2116-5-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2116-5-28**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: fever, chest pain, shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal Intubation Central Venous Line Arterial Line Foley Catheter Bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: 84M poor historian, with h/o multiple myeloma, COPD, PE, who by report, presented to [**Hospital1 882**] ED earlier today after developing left side SSCP while at the Infusion Center where he was receiving Velcade infusion for multiple myeloma.
He was receiving 2U PRBCs with his infusion, and then described 15 minutes of new onset chest pain, without sob, n/v, diaphoresis, which resolved spontaneously prior to arrival in the ED.
By report he also had a fever yesterday, and again this morning, but was afebrile at the time he started his transfusion.
He then developed a fever, cough, and chest discomfort in the setting of of blood transfusion, raising concern for transfusion reaction.
He then developed SSCP, and repeat ECG showed "T-wave normalization" for which he was given sl ntg, nitro paste.
CXR without focal infiltrate.
He was continued on heparin gtt, and empirically given vanc/zosyn x 1 for a presumed pulmonary source, along with solumedrol 125mg iv x 1.

In the setting of severe central airways disease, there is a small possibility that PE is present, but overall, there is low likelihood of pulmonary embolus .
Renal U/S: no hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.
[**2116-5-21**] CXR: PM in R chest, no focal infiltrate, +cardiomegaly.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
Immunoflourescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) (Final       [**2116-5-26**]):    NEGATIVE for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii)..    FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
Respiratory Viral Identification (Final [**2116-5-26**]):       Positive for Influenza A viral antigen.
Given the rapid progression of airspace disease, diffuse aspiration pneumonia is likely.
There is near complete occlusion of the bronchus intermedius from secretions.
Consolidation in the right lower lobe becomes mass like and should be followed in [**5-18**] weeks to ensure resolution.
Mediastinal adenopathy is likely reactive.
Right main pulmonary artery dilation to 3.1 cm likely represents pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Distal trachea and right greater than left bronchus tracheobronchomalacia is likely but can be confirmed on dedicated imaging if indicated.
Calcified hilar lymph nodes likely represent the sequela of prior granulomatous disease.
He received vanc/zosyn and solumedrol empirically given concern for neutropenic fever.
Dyspnea was transient with resolution by time of arrival to MICU, and hypoxia resolved by AM.
It is possible that resp distress occured in setting of pneumonia with fever accompanied by poor rate ctrl in pt with afib and baseline cardiomyopathy, which was further exacerbated by delivery of IV fluids at OSH per pt history.
Continued treatment for pneumonia given question of LLL infiltrate on CXR.
However, as not neutropenic with only first dose of velcade today, abx pared back to ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
He was not diuresed here despite highly elevated BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 4576**] here (baseline unknown) as appeared euvolemic in setting of improved rate control.
Of note, concern at OSH for blood transfusion reaction which was ruled out on further evaluation.
Given low likelihood of pulmonary embolus on V/Q scan and ruling out for MI by cardiac enzymes, heparin gtt discontinued.
Also discontinued steroids as thought to have poor air movement at baseline with COPD but no acute exacerbation; continued home meds.
Patient was treated for two days on the floor until he developed progressive dyspnea and tachypnea and required readmission to the ICU.
CXR showed the development of a right lung consolidation with rapid progression of airspace disease on CT chest.
Nasal swab for influenza returned positive.
Treatment for influenza with oseltamavir was initiated as well as broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and meropenem for health-care associated pneumonia.
# Multisystem Organ Failure: In setting of respiratory failure, he became hypotensive with increasing pressor requiring and developing acute renal failure progressing to anuria.
Poor prognosis of underlying multiple myeloma was confirmed with his outpatient oncologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2856**].
Initiation of hemodialysis was discussed with patient's HCP and it was decided that hemodialysis was not consistent with the patient's wishes.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine 2.0 in [**2115-9-17**],  Creatinine remained under baseline until patient was transferred back to the MICU when he developed anuric renal failure in the setting of septic shock.
# Multiple myeloma: Long standing, failed alkeran/prednisone and started on velcade on [**2116-5-14**], followed at [**Company 2860**].
Diff at [**Hospital1 882**] notable for 15% plasma cells on microscopy; with flow cytometry confirming plasmcytosis.
In discussion with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2856**], outpatient oncologist, poor prognosis was established and communicated to patient's family.
# Chest pain: H/o CAD s/p left LAD stent.
ECG with some dynamic t-wave changes with minimal ST depressions in the lateral leads likely due to poorly rate controlled afib with as resolved with rate control.
Completed rule out with serial cardiac enzymes.
Heparin gtt discontinued and not transfused blood for Hct <30 as no evidence of ongoing ischemia.
# Atrial fibrillation: Rate-controlled afib, on coumadin on admission.
S/p PPM for sick sinus syndrome which was confirmed to be functioning properly by EP.
Switched from atenolol to metoprolol given question of renal failure with goal to titrate to HR 60s.
# Anemia: Baseline hct ~24, attributed to myeloma and CLL.
No evidence of active ischemia so Hct transfusion goal lowered to >21.
