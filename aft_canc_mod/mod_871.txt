Admission Date:  [**2158-6-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-9-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2103-6-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Dilaudid / Codeine / Ativan  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5301**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 55 F with complicated medical history who has been transferred from Rehab/[**Hospital3 417**] for dyspnea, acute on chronic renal failure, volume overload, and fungemia.
In [**Month (only) 116**] of this year, presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with abdominal pain.
Has significant PMHx for T1DM, HTN, PVD and was found in the ED to have extensive calcification of her mesenteric arteries.
Post op had respiratory failure requiring prolonged intubation and eventual tracheostomy.
The etiology of her respiratory failure was unclear at her discharge.
During her hospitalization, she also had a "troponin leak" without EKG changes thought to be demand ischemia by their cardiology consultants.
An echo done on [**2158-6-18**] showed global hypokinesis with EF 25-30%, dilated LA, LVH, moderated MR, moderate TR, although image quality was poor.
Her hospitalization was also complicated by hyponatremia of unclear [**Name2 (NI) 10810**].
Her hospitalization was also complicated by acute on chronic renal failure (s/p transplant in [**2143**]).
She did have episode of ATN in setting of her mesenteric ischemia with peak Cr of 4.3 with return to her baseline of 1.4-1.8 at time of discharge.
On the day of admission, she also developed respiratory distress with increasing volume retention.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of her fungemia, renal failure and repiratory distress.
HEENT: NC/AT, Pupil reactive on right, EOMI without nystagmus, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in OP Neck: supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.

## Fungemia: Patient was diagnosed with fungemia by blood culture at [**Hospital1 **] and [**Hospital3 417**], likely due to TPN.
Other sources include possible seeding of chronic thrombus in UE.
TTE on [**2158-6-23**] demonstrated no evidence of vegetations.
Ophthalmology eval demonstrated no opthalmic candidemia.
Patient did however continue to spike fevers while on antibiotic therapy, concerning for a new or resistant infection in the context of patient's immunosuppresion.
Another possible source was pulmonary since patient's CT chest from [**2158-7-6**] demonstrated interval development of bilateral pulmonary nodules.
Unclear etiology for bilateral pulmonary nodules.
Nodules may have represented septic emboli from endocarditis, although no vegetations were demonstrated by echo on [**2158-6-23**] or [**2158-7-11**].
During this time, patient remained afebrile and was converted back to PO fluconazole prior to discharge.
A TTE was done which showed a small (0.7 x0.7 cm) mass attached to the highly calcified mitral annulus which may be a vegetation or a mobile piece of calcification coming off the larger mitral annular calcification.
A follow up TEE was recommended, however the patient began to have increased emesis and it was unable to be performed.
Renal u/s [**2158-6-23**] showed stable borderline hydronephrosis in the transplant kidney with elevated resistive indices and CT ab/pelvis [**2158-6-23**] showed air within the transplant kidney collecting systems, new from comparison, likely iatrogenic from foley placement.
Then upon admission to the floor, patient had intractable fluid overload with associated edema and shortness of breath.
Patient underwent hemodialysis three times which greatly improved fluid overload and shortness of breath.
The patient's acute on chronic renal failure was believed to be ATN vs. prerenal.
The renal service was closely following the patient and recommended placement of an HD catheter in preparation for hemodialysis based on her worsening renal function and fluid status.
The FK506 was elevated and the tacrolimus dose was halved.
## Respiratory failure and shortness of breath: Patient initially had respiratory failure in the MICU, likely secondary to a combination of acid-base abnormalities, stiffness from fluid overload, and infectious process.
Patient was started on cefepime and vancomycin initially for concern of gram negatives and MRSA, which was noted on OSH blood culture.
Cefepime was discontinued since there was no obvious target and vancomycin was maintained for MRSA.
Vancomycin was then discontinued given negative blood cultures and concern for vancomycin-induced thrombocytopenia.
After transfer from the MICU, patient developed increasing shortness of breath with concern for fluid overload and infectious process.
Patient's shortness of breath improved significantly with three rounds of hemodialysis.
However, a CT scan of chest demonstrated interval development of pleural effusions and bilateral pulmonary nodules, concerning for an infectious process.
Thoracentesis demonstrated a transudate effusion.
Her fluid status was closely monitored as she was getting an increasing fluid load for hypercalcemia treatment.
for altered mental status and question of respiratory distress.
A CXR was done which showed worsening pulmonary edema however the patient had good oxygen saturation The patient's mental status did not impro .
## Hypercalcemia: Ms. [**Known lastname **] had a persistently elevated Ca with unknown cause.
A bone scan was negative for metastatic osseous disease.
Hypercalcemia thought to be secondary to imobilization.
## Hyponatremia: Pt was initially hyponatremic to 125 on admission, likely in setting of volume overload from CHF/renal failure.
## Type 1 Diabetes melitus: Patient has type 1 diabetes with major complications as listed above.
## Anemia: Patient had anemia of chronic disease, most likely secondary to chronic renal insufficiency.
No other transfusions were given, and th pt may require outpt colonoscopy.
.. ## Thrombocytopenia: Patient developed thrombocytopenia during admission.
Thrombocytopenia was thought to have developed secondary to vancomycin and platelets increased after discontinuing vancomycin.
She again grew out many bacteria on a urine culture and was treated with ciprofloxacin and fluconazole (last day of cipro [**2158-9-23**], last day of fluconazole [**2158-9-18**]) .
## CAD: Patient is s/p MI x 2.
Patient had no symptoms during admission.
## HTN: Patient's blood pressures have been occasionally elevated and hydralazine was increased to 15mg PO qid to assess for improved BP control.
Ativan and ambien were discontinued secondary to increased somnolence with these meds.
There was no clear source, with possiblities being septic (LLL opacity and 4+ MRSA in sputum, though no fever or WBC), adrenal insufficiency (started empirically on stress dose steroids), or cardiogenic.
Cardiology was consulted who felt that this was not acute ischemia, and that the decrement in function was likely overstated; it was felt that her prior study had been of sub-optimal quality and that probably had not been a significant interval change in LV-EF, and that this low EF was probably a mix of a baseline ischemic cardiomyopathy with a superimposed toxic/infectious cardiomyopathy.
There was also concern, despite the physiologic controversy of this theory, that she was grossly volume overloaded and thus had tipped over to the disadvantageous arm of Starling's curve.
In the setting of this gross volume overload with associated large bilateral pleural effusions (that had been tapped one month prior and found to be transudative, thought to be due to heart failure), she developed worsening respiratory distress and was placed back on the ventilator on minimal settings (p/s [**9-28**], fio2 40%) with immediate relief of her dyspnea.
She tolerated this well and was able to be weaned off pressure support and onto a trach mask without difficulty.
She was started on CVVHD to relieve her gross volume overload.
With the combined effect of these interventions, her bp slowly climbed over the week, and she eventually became hypertensive with bp's in the 140-160's.
During the course, she had one episode of afib with RVR.
## Hallucinations/delusions: Pt having active hallucinations.
Being treated for urine bacterial and fungal infections.
No other abnormalities other than encephalopthy per EEG to explain new hallucinations.
MRI was unrevealing, Ca under control, head CT negative x2.
## Atrial fibrillation: Pt went into atrial fibrillation in the unit.
## Coronary artery disease: No evidence of active ischemia.
## Ischemic cardiomyopathy: Total body volume overloaded given sacral edema and bilateral pleural effusions.
## End stage renal disease s/p transplant: Needed HD and CVVH in unit.
## Diabetes mellitus, Type 1: Mildly hyperglycemic throughout the day.
## Respiratory failure: Pt c/o mild shortness of breath, but ascribes this to the valve on the trach collar.
Has required intermittent nebs for wheeziness.
## Hypercalcemia: Unlikely to be related to breast cancer as she has had a negative bone scan during this hospitalization.
[**Month (only) 116**] be hypercalcemia from immobility.
