She recently saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2028**] for initial visit after being referred to him by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] secondary to a recent discovery of an adnexal mass.
She feels that her abdominal distention is worse, and at times is making it difficult to breathe.
She is a gravida 1, para 0 woman who noted 2 weeks ago a little bit of spotting and abdominal bloating.
An ultrasound was performed, which revealed a complex solid right adnexal mass concerning for an ovarian malignancy.
A small amount of free fluid was noted.
The right adnexal mass measured 10.3 x 7.4 x 11 cm and had a moderate amount of internal vasculature.
There were central cystic changes and obviously it was solid as well.
She denies any chest pain, but does report feeling short of breath mostly from the pressure from her diaphragm.
She denies any lightheadedness, visual or hearing changes.
She does not have any family history suggestive of a predisposition to hereditary breast ovarian cancer syndrome.
Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  She does report a history of mitral valve prolapse.
She does not have a history of hypertension, asthma, or thromboembolic disorder.
No other surgery.
She does report a history of an abnormal Pap smear in the past, but biopsies have all been negative.
She denies any history of pelvic infections.
Ext:  no lower extremity edema, no calf tenderness .
I do not palpate any evidence of malignancy or irregularity.
There is some nodularity in the posterior cul-de-sac that I can appreciate only on bimanual exam.
There is a palpable mass noted in the midline that extends superiorly.
RADIOLOGY ========= CHEST PORT.
Aside from mild bibasilar atelectasis, lungs are clear.
No pneumothorax is present.
New bibasilar opacities ____might be consistent with combination of atelectasis and aspiration, although infection cannot be excluded.
Mild vascular engorgement.
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT Study Date of [**2143-9-12**] 8:45 AM IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT involving the right upper extremity.
Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease including fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
CARDIOLOGY ========== TTE (Complete) Done [**2143-9-3**] at 7:47:28 AM      FINAL Mild bileaflet mitral valve prolapse with mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Sinus rhythm.
Q waves in leads V1-V2 with mild ST segment elevation.
On hospital day 3, she underwent examination under anesthesia, exploratory laparotomy, drainage of ascites, tumor debulking, intracolic omentectomy, small bowel resection with reanastomosis (stapled), bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, supracervical hysterectomy, cystoscopy.
*) Neuro: Upon transfer to the floor post-operative day 1, Ms. [**Known lastname **] experienced hypoventilation (RR 5-6 during sleep) thought to be secondary to narcotics.
Her pain was subsequently managed with dilaudid and toradol with little relief of pain.
After being made DNR/DNI (see below under Palliative Care), Ms. [**Known lastname 16391**] pain was also managed with a fentanyl patch.
To help minimize pain from bowel edema and distention, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was also placed on IV dexamethasone on post-operative day 13. .
*) Cardiac: Given her history of mitral valve prolapse, an echocardiography was obtained and showed mild bileaflet mitral valve prolapse with mild mitral regurgitation; preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function mild pulmonary hypertension.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] had hypotension intra-operatively, requiring 3 untis of PRBC and placement on a neosynephrine drip.
She was transfused another 2 units of RPBC in the ICU, bolused 3 liters of IVF, and eventually weened off of the neo drip.
She had no other episodes of hypotension nor any cardiac complaints during her hospital course.
*) Respiratory After extubation in the ICU on post-operative day 1, Ms. [**Known lastname **] had no respiratory issues or complaints.
*) Renal Pre-operatively, Ms. [**Known lastname **] had decreased urine output from pre-renal etiology (FeNA <0.1), likely secondary to third spacing from increased vascular permeability and decreased intravascular oncotic pressures.
RUE extremity edema > LUE was evaluated on post-operative day 9 with an unremarkable RUE doppler study.
Hematology oncology was consulted on post-operative day 8 for possible chemotherapy during hospitalization.
Her pathology report was finalized on post-operative day 9 and after discussion of prognosis and potential response to chemotherapy with the medical oncologists and the palliative care service (see below), Ms. [**Known lastname **] and her partner decided to decline chemotherapy.
*) Palliative Care Ms. [**Known lastname **] and her partner desired to meet with the Palliative Care Service on post-operative day 10 after Ms. [**Known lastname **] had an elevated temperature (see below), for which she declined work-up of other than blood and urine cultures.
Given her small bowel resection, a NGT was placed intra-operatively.
Ms. [**Known lastname 16391**] nausea was well-controlled on IV antiemetics until post-operative day 8 when she began having nausea and vomiting.
Possible etiologies included TPN induced transaminitis, pre-existing fatty liver disease (as seen on CT scan [**2143-8-30**]), or toradol induced hepatotoxicity.
*) ID: afebrile Ms. [**Known lastname **] received Ancef and Flagyl x 3 days post-operatively for infection prophylaxis.
She remained afebrile until post-operative 10 when she had a T max 101.3.
She otherwise remained afebrile for the remainder of her hospital course.
She was unable to tolerate more than liquids during her hospital course and, after her nausea and vomiting recurred, was NPO for the remainder of her hospital course.
