History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 88012**] is an 84 year old gentleman transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] hospital for evaluation of complete heart block and possible coronary intervention.
In brief, the patient presented to dialysis on the morning of [**10-24**] with gross hematuria.
He makes little to no urine at baseline, but developed intermittent hematuria 4 months ago that was not worked up as he attributed it to aspirin.
Per an ICU admit note dated [**10-27**], the patient's abdominal CT demonstrated an irregularly shapped bladder wall concerning for neoplasm.
Cystoscopy attempted but unsuccessful due to hematuria.
Prior to biopsy, the patient developed chest pain in the setting of a 10 point Hct drop with an elevated troponin.
Cardiology reportedly cleared the patient for biopsy, but the morning of the procedure (and of transfer to the hospital) he developed 3 pauses of about 25 seconds each, twice requiring CPR (no greater specifics) before generating a 40bpm escape rhythm and was taken to cath for pacing wire placement and left heart cath.
Per the patient, he presented to [**Hospital1 1474**] on Sunday for worsening chronic hematuria.
He denies ever having chest pain or difficulty breathing.
He does describe a sensation of abdominal discomfort prior to his team's cardiac concerns.
He also reports intermittent penile discomfort with the three way foley in place as though he cannot urinate.
He has no other complaints at this time.
Per the patient's son in law, the patient has had several recent admissions for dyspnea, ?

The patient was planned for CABG within a week, but was found to have a bladder neoplasm concerning for metastatic disease and intravesicular clot in the setting of longstanding hematuria.
# Complete Heart Block: Upon admission, the patient was intermittently in complete heart block, either as an advancement of his trifasicular block, or the result of ischemia.
Pt developed Pacer induced tachycardia which was corrected by EP via manipulation of the pacer settings.
# CAD:  [**Hospital1 1474**] Cath report: 80% LAD: 80% ostial stenosis w/ 80-90% mid segment stenosis, RCA: 99% ostial stenosis with 90% proximal stenosis, LCSX: moderate diffuse disease wtih severe proximal OM stenosis.
The patient has a history of CAD and 3 vessel disease with plans to go to CABG within one week, given suspected ACS.
However, surgical plans were complicated by a newly found bladder vs prostate tumor and the decision was made to continue medical management.
He had continued episodes of angina initially in the setting of hematuria and initiation of therapy for presumed prostate cancer.
He was unable to tolerate long acting nitrate due to hypotension.
B-blocker and ACE-I were held initially in the setting of heart block but metoprolol was resumed prior to discharge.
Angina was stable without recurrent events in 48 hours prior to discharge.
# Hematuria: The patient has a bladder mass on CT with surrounding lymph nodes suggestive of metastatic disease.
Presumably causing hematuria and painful urethral clotting that initially required constant irrigation.
The patient's CBI was eventually discontinued and his hematuria resolved.
Both urology and oncology agreed that Mr. [**Known lastname 88012**] was not a candidate for cystoscopy and would not seek further direct imaging unless hematuria recurred.
# GERD/dysphagia: The patient had multiple complaints of heartburn, each time resolved with Tums.
The patient also complained of a feeling of food getting stuck in a substernal area, followed by a burning sensation, often relieved with belching.
The patient reports this sensation has been ongoing for several months.
# L Inguinal hernia: Appeared stable.

Discharge Instructions: You had a very slow heart rate called complete heart block and a pacemaker was inserted that will help your heart rhytm be regular and strong.
The blood in your urine was concerning and we found a suspicious mass on the CT scan that may be cancer in your bladder.
At the same time, your PSA was very elevated so we started you on Casedex, a medicine that may help to slow prostate cancer.
Because you are on aspirin for your heart, the oncologists were very reluctant to perform a biopsy in your bladder and prostate.
The bleeding in your bladder looks like it has almost stopped, you will also see a urologist in about 3 weeks.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 261**] if the bleeding from your penis increases.
Start taking Bicalutamide (Casodex) for possible prostate cancer 3.
Start taking nitroglycerin as needed for chest pain or jaw pain.
Call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] for any chest or jaw pain that does not go away after nitroglycerin.
