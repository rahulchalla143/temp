On [**12-27**] he was at rehab when he had a witnessed event consisting of generalized limb jerking for about 5 minutes.
He has had an LP which showed 19 WBC w/ a lymphocytic predominance and 1 RBC.
He denies HA, vision changes, numbness or sensory changes.
He also denies dysphagia or dysarthria.
He feels that he legs have "lost power" but is unable to characterize this further, He also reports abm pain which is sharp and intermittent, mostly in the RUQ.
He denies changes in bowel or bladder, fevers, chills or cough.
Medullary Astrocytoma: s/p stereotactic endoscopic ventriculostomy on [**2186-1-25**] and surgical debulking of the fourth ventricular exophytic pilocytic astrocytoma on [**2186-11-24**].
HTN   Social History: -EtOH: former -tobacco: former per records (but states that he is still smoking 2 PPD) -drugs: denies   Family History: -mother: HTN, stroke -father: died   Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 98.1  P: 80-95 R: 16 BP: 152/72 SaO2: 99% on trach General: Awake, cooperative, NAD.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx but limited view, trached with increased clear thick secretions Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity  Pulmonary: Lungs with transmitted upper airway sounds, decreased breath sounds @ bases, thick white secretions Cardiac: nl.
There are no paraphasic errors or dysarthria however what he says is not always logical (says he doesn't want to talk because he hasn't washed his mouth).
Comprehension seems slow and inconsistent at times, despite the translator.
No neglect but + apraxia bilaterally  CN I: not tested II,III: pt does not cooperate with formal VF testing but does blink to threat bilaterally, pupils 4mm->2mm bilaterally, fundi normal III,IV,V: does not bed sclera fully in any direction but this is symmetrical and he denies diplopia.
few beats of asterixis, + postural tremor.
No pronator drift.
Motor exam limited due to motor impersistence however he appears to have full strength with maximal impulse testing    Delt [**Hospital1 **] Tri WE FE Grip   C5   C6 C7  C6 C7 C8/T1 L 5- -------------------> R 5  ------------------->     IP Quad Hamst DF [**Last Name (un) 938**] PF   L2  L3  L4-S1 L4 L5  S1/S2 L 5- -------------------> R 5  ------------------->    Reflex: No clonus   [**Hospital1 **] Tri  Bra  Pat An Plantar   C5 C7   C6   L4  S1 CST L 1-------------   0  Flexor R 1-------------   0  Flexor  -Sensory: unreliable, no deficits pinprick, but cold sensation, vibratory sense, proprioception are extremely inconsistent.
-Coordination: dysdiadochokinesia w/ [**Name (NI) 11140**], pt does not cooperate with HSK bilaterally.
There was minimal waking background.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing, and  there were no epileptiform features.
Status post suboccipital craniectomy with extensive post-surgical changes and suggestion of possible residual tumor at the caudal aspect of the fourth ventricle without significant interval change.
Interval resolution of tiny intraventricular hemorrhage.
No new intracranial hemorrhage is identified.
IMPRESSION: Residual enhancing lesion in the left posterior medulla/fourth ventricle suggestive of residual neoplasm.
Interval increase in ventricular size and increase in periventricular hyperintensities which could represent transependymal CSF migration, ventricular enlargement vs. vasculitis or inflammatory lesions.
Interval enlargement of non-enhancing lesion in the right frontal lobe of uncertain etiology.
Lack of enhancement argues against neoplastic etiology.
No evidence for acute ischemia.
[**2187-1-24**] VIDEO SPEECH AND SWALLOW STUDY: There was aspiration after the swallow from residual that could not be passed through the upper esophageal sphincter.
The patient continues to present with severe to profound pharyngeal dysphagia.
12/29/08Lumbar puncture: Openning pressure of 21.5, no evidence of infection.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 50 year-old RH man with a PMH of a pilocytic astrocytoma s/p partial surgical resection who presented with a seizure from an OSH.
His neurologic exam on admission revealed marked encephalopathy, characterized by lack of orientation and inattention but no paraphasic errors, dysarthria or difficulty naming.
On exam, he had R facial droop with very mild L sided weakness of UMN pattern.
Given unclear precipitation for his seizure (brain stem tumor is not epileptogenic), he underwent LP which showed pleocytosis (WBC 19~52) with lymphocytic predominance.
The following other issues were addressed during his stay:  # Medullary Astrocytoma: s/p stereotactic endoscopic ventriculostomy on [**2186-1-25**] and surgical debulking of the fourth ventricular exophytic pilocytic astrocytoma on [**2186-11-24**].
He was given 3 days of gentamicin and vancomycin for prophylactic therapy.
He has a right frontal surgical scar which is healing well.
He will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**3-1**] for appt and head CT.  # Encephalopathy: Multifactorial delirium.
LP done and described as above without evidence of infection.
MR head on [**1-17**] showed ventricular dilatation and a VP shunt was placed on [**1-26**].
He was also given a scopalamine patch but developed delirium related to this.
Measures continued to be taken to improve his swallowing function as his greatest risk was repeated aspiration pneumonia from this.
A video swallow study on [**2187-1-24**] showed aspiration of nearly everything and patient was kept NPO with tube feeds via PEG.
# Acute renal failure: Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed ARF with Cr bumping up to 2.6 likely due to acyclovir +/- vancomycin given FENa 5%.
# Nutrition: On HD#1, while he was still quite encephalopathic, he pulled his PEG out.
Following PEG placement pt complained of abdominal pain and CT was done which was not indicative of acute issues but patient did have bilateral free air likely due to insufflation during PEG replacement.
# Aspiration PNA: He completed 8 days of Vancomycin and cefepime for hospital acquired aspiration pneumonia.
# Atrial fibrillation: During hospitalization patient went into Afib with RVR (Pulse into 140's).
It was decided to hold anticoagulation at this time due to risk of intracranial hemorrage.
A Pre-operative U/A showed 11 WBC and patient spiked fever to 100.7 and so treated with Bactrim for 7 days, ending the day of discharge.
# Anemia: Likely due to chronic disease and serial phlebotomy.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: Two (2) Tablet PO q6h as needed as needed for fever or pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7665**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Pilocytic astrocytoma in brainstem s/p subtotal resection Encephalopathy Seizures Hypertension Anemia of chronic disease Urinary tract infection Bulbar dysfunction Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation Acute renal failure   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You returned with 2 episodes of witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizures while you were at rehab.
Given pleocytosis, you were initially started on broad-spectrum antibiotics but upon no growth, your antibiotics were discontinued and you remained afebrile without seizure activity during this admission.
PEG was replaced per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**1-8**] without complication.
Also, you removed your own trach on [**1-5**] but given that you were breathing without difficulty with good cough reflex, it was not replaced.
An MRI of your brain and a spinal tap showed increased pressure in and around your brain.
You failed a video speech and swallow study.
You cannot take anything by mouth or you are at risk of choking, getting pneumonia and dying from this.
If you or your family notice further confusion, if you develop any chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain or other concerning symptoms please call your doctor.
