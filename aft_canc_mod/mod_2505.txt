The pathology report from [**Hospital6 **] revealed Renal Cell Carcinoma.
A metastatic work-up with Head CT, Chest CT, Abd-Pelvic CT, and Bone scan was negative except for an adrenal mass whose density was not consistent with benign adenoma.
He did develop LUE swelling but U/S and CT were negative for DVT.
He was extubated without complication on POD 1.
On POD 2 the chest tube was removed, CXR showed minimal PTX.
He was transfused 1 Unit PRBCs for anemia (Hct 27).
He remained in the ICU for observation related to mobilizing fluid and concern for volume overload given his compromised cardiac output.
It was noted that he developed a contact dermatitis, presumably from the tape during surgical positioning; this resolved after several days with topical cream for comfort.
At the time of discharge he was urinating independently, tolerating PO diet and pain moderately controlled on PO meds.
