He was recently discharged on [**3-16**] after 2 month hospital stay complicated by repeated respiratory failure ultimately requiring trach and VAP.
At the time of discharge from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] last week, he was not tolerating trach collar mask, but was off all antibiotics except for prophylactic antibiotics.
Patient is sent in today from [**Hospital1 **] for Fever to [**Age over 90 **] yesterday and increased work of breathing.
A chest CT performed here showed worsening pulmonary infiltrates suggestive of a VAP and was negative for PE.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: - [**4-/2154**] p/w fevers, night sweats, and weight loss in the setting of a left inguinal lymph node.
- Treated with six cycles of CHOP/Rituxan with good response, but showed evidence for relapse in [**12/2154**] and was treated with MINE chemotherapy for two cycles.
- Multiple GI bleeds requiring ICU admissions and multiple transfusions and embolization of his bleeding.
- Noted to have CNS lesions felt consistent with PTLD and this was treated with a course of Rituxan.
No evidence for recurrence of the PTLD.
- Acute liver GVHD, on CellCept, prednisone, and photophoresis.
- [**2157-12-28**] Photophoresis was d/c'd due to episodes of bacteremia and eventual removal of his apheresis catheter.
- [**2158-6-13**] restarted photopheresis on a weekly basis on , but then discontinued this again on [**2158-9-7**] as this was felt not to be making any impact on his liver function tests.
- undergone phlebotomy due to iron overload with corresponding drop in his ferritin.
He has continued with transient rises in his transaminases and bilirubin and has remained on varying doses of CellCept and prednisone which has been slowly tapered over the time.
- [**2159-1-19**] admission due to increasing right hip pain.
MRI revealed edema and infiltrating process in the psoas muscle bilaterally.
After extensive workup, this was felt related to an infection and required several admissions with completion of antibiotics in 03/[**2158**].
- [**7-/2160**]: Last scans showed no evidence for lymphom and he has remained in remission.
-In [**5-/2161**], noted to have tiny echogenic nodule on abdominal [**Year (4 digits) 950**].
MRI of the liver also showed this nodule but was not as concerning on review and he is due to have a repeat MRI imaging in early [**Month (only) **].
-On [**2161-8-3**], worsening cough and was noted to have a small new pneumothorax in the left apical area.
This has essentially resolved over time - Issues with weight loss (followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]); multiple tests done with no etiology found; question malabsorption related to GVHD - Has on and off respiratory infections and has been treated with antibiotics with possible pneumonia.
Question underlying exacerbations of pulmonary GVHD in setting of his URIs.

No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
No acute aortic pathology.
Bilateral small pleural effusions with associated atelectasis, decreased on the left and increased on the right since [**2162-3-4**].
Persistent lower lobe pulmonary consolidations with interval increased conspicuity of bilateral associated tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] abnormalities and layering lower lobe bronchus secretions, highly suggestive of aspiration superimposed on infection.
Mild improvement of left lower lobe consolidations.
Less confluent central consolidations on the right with new peripheral opacities in the right lower lobe as well as in the right upper lobe, concerning for worsening infection.
Right upper lobe opacities also demonstrate equivocal tiny cavitary foci, possibly related to patient's immunocompromised state.
Cirrhosis with ascites, as characterized previously on [**Male First Name (un) 950**] from [**2162-3-15**].

Klebsiella pneumonia and bacteremia.
Patient presented with fevers, increased pulmonary secretetions and increased ventillator requirements.
His blood cultures and sputum cultures were possitive for Klebsiella.
He was initially treated with Vancomycin/Meropenem/Bactrim (for concern for stenotrophomonas or acinetobacter), but this was later tailored to Meropenem and Tobramycin for ESBL Klebs double coverage.
Patient has broncholitis obliterans and muscle weakness, and is now trached.
He was tolerating up to 6 hours of trach collar mask at [**Hospital1 **] prior to admission.
There was some concern for a component of aspiration.
Likely due to malnutrition and prologned antibiotic use.
GVHD:  Resulting in elevated LFTs and broncholitis oblietans.
Given IvIG for low IgG levels.
The patient had an elevated Beta glucan level which was thought to be spurious.
# Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p allo [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3242**]: Most recent PET scan with no evidence of recurrent disease and he remains in remission.
# Hyperlipidemia: continue simvastatin  # Hypothyroidism: continued on Levothyroxine  # Anemia.
At baseline - normocytic anemia, workup showed anemia of chronic inflammation.
