She presented with chronic cough, worse for a 15 month duration, and a 13 pound weight loss.
She was found to have a poorly differentiated non small cell lung cancer in the left upper lobe, emanating from the lobar bronchus.
It measured 3 by 2.6 cm and was associated with bulky mediastinal adenopathy.
An otolaryngology examination confirmed the presence of vocal cord paralysis.
Her chest CT scan showed no evidence of liver or mediastinal involvement.
PET scan reportedly showed no evidence of metastatic involvement in the periphery.
She was initially deemed unresectable due to her bulky N2 disease and was started on definitive chemoradiotherapy with Carboplatinum and Taxotere.
She did well and a recent CT scan showed a dramatic response to the primary tumor as well as mediastinal lymph nodes.
During the operation, she had severe damage to her left lung from radiation therapy and her left lung became extremely edematous and she developed hemorrhage into her airways.
In the end, this turned out not to be necessary and we completed the operation through the median sternotomy and then converted it back to the thoracotomy for the final portions of it, which included the latissimus dorsi flap.
