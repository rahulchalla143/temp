Admission Date:  [**2152-6-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2152-7-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-3-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation Femoral central line Arterial line Internal jugular central line  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes and hypertension.
He presented to the ED today from pulmonary clinic for hypoxia and shortness of breath.
He was in his usual state of health until 6 days ago when he developed sore neck and malaise, then low grade fevers to 100, non-productive cough, and shortness of breath.
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was diagnosed with COPD in [**2152-3-13**] when he was hospitalized for several weeks for increasing shortness of breath and a CT scan revealed pulmonary edema, pulmonary nodules, and severe emphysema.
Of note, the patient had a recent COPD flare and was admitted for 2 days to [**Hospital3 4107**] from [**2063-6-1**].
On [**2152-6-16**], the day he developed his myalgias, he had f/u CT scan for his pulmonary nodules that showed extensive centrilobular emphysema, resolution of all but one pulmonary nodules, and some ground-glass opacities at the lung bases, that could represent inflammatory process or recurrent aspiration.
A CXR showed bilateral Lower Lobe PNA.
He was initially placed on BiPAP for presumed COPD flare, with variable effect, then placed on a nonrebreather and his saturations remained at 96%.
WBC was elevated at 18.
He was wearing the non-rebreather and was able to speak in complete sentences although he looked like he was in mild distress.
He was slightly tremulous.
ROS + for subjective fever, recent epistaxis and hemoptysis in setting of using home O2 as wll as some chest tightness.
General: Thin man in NAD HEENT: EOMI, PERRL slight scleral icterus, MMM, 7cm JVD (non-elevated) Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally, no wheezes, ronchi or rales Cardiac: RR, nl S1 S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated Abdomen: Distended, mildly tender to deep palpation over the RUQ, hepatomegaly noted 3-4 cm beneath subcostal margin + BS x 4  Extremities: No edema or asterixis noted Neurologic: Alert, oriented x 3.
Able to relate history without difficulty.

Patchy areas of ground-glass opacity and nodular foci are noted within the posterior aspect of the lingula and also within the right middle lobe.
These opacities appear to spare the periphery within the bilateral lower lobes and right middle lobe.
Diffuse severe centrilobular emphysema is again identified.
A stable right upper lobe triangular opacity is again noted most likely represents an intrapulmonary lymph node or small area of atelectasis.
No pleural effusions are identified.
Multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes are identified, some of which are slightly enlarged compared to the prior study.
Specifically, there is a precarinal lymph node currently measuring 13 mm and measuring 9 mm on the prior study.
Multiple other prominent mediastinal lymph nodes in the pretracheal, prevascular space and AP window are again identified.
No pericardial effusion is identified.
A healed right seventh rib fracture is again noted.
No new osseous fractures are identified.
There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions noted.
IMPRESSION: Multifocal diffuse ground-glass and nodular opacities noted predominantly within the bilateral lower lobes and the right middle lobe which have developed since prior CT of [**2152-6-16**].
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**Doctor First Name **] is a 50 year old man with a history of obesity, hypertension, and COPD who presented with hypoxia and low grade fever.
He was being treated for pneumonia/COPD exacerbation and was found to have AML on BM biopsy.
He was intubated for worsening respiratory status and developed ARF.
Initially was thought to be having COPD flare and was empirically covered with antibiotics and steroids.
CT scan showed Multifocal diffuse ground-glass and nodular opacities noted predominantly within the bilateral lower lobes and the right middle lobe which had developed since his prior CT one week earlier ([**2152-6-16**]).
Mechanical ventilation was unable to be weaned secondary to persistent profound hypoxia.
Due to monocytosis on CBC diff a bone marrow biopsy was obtained to rule out malignancy.
The biopsy revealed dense monocytosis in the bone marrow consistent with Acute Myelogenous Leukemia.
Required CVVH due to poor renal function (see below).
On hospital day 14, patient had progressive respiratory failure that was refractory to all interventions, developed progressive acidosis and peacefully passed away in the presence of his family at 2:08pm.
As above CVVH was continued for toxin removal in addition to controling his acidosis and volume overload.
# Acute renal failure: The patient developed acute renal failure from ATN.
He was found to have granular casts and his urine output decreased.
His blood glucose was elevated and this was thought to have been due to the stress dose steroids or underlying inflammatory process.
