CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
There are moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with associated collapse of the lower lobes bilaterally.
There are scattered ground-glass opacities within the lungs, predominantly in a perihilar distribution.
There are non-pathologically enlarged mediastinal nodes with no pathologic lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Bilateral pleural effusions with reactive atelectasis.
Scattered ground-glass opacities in a perihilar distribution.
These finding are nonspecific, but likely represents pulmonary edema.
2 cm soft tissue mass in the left anterior mediastinum posterior to the internal mammary vessels, of undetermined cause or significance.

Moderate-severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
No LV mass/thrombus.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: mid anterior - hypo; mid anteroseptal - hypo; mid inferolateral - hypo; mid anterolateral - hypo; anterior apex - akinetic; septal apex- akinetic; lateral apex - akinetic; apex - akinetic;  RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Mild (1+) MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include hypokinesis of the mid antero-septum, anterior and lateral walls with akinesis of the distal LV and apex.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
#Pain She had an epidural for pain control and was followed by the pain service.
A chest X-ray showed LLL consolidation, atelectasis and effusion.
She required a face mask and careful monitoring of her respiratory status.
She was again transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress with O2 sats in the 70's.
The incision was opened slightly on the right lower side and packed with a wet to dry dressing.
Her tube feedings were held for a short time due to continued respiratory distress.
#Cardiology POD 5 she awoke with chest pain and O2 sats in the 80's.
A chest CT showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
An ECHO was done that showed moderate to severe regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
A EKG showed changes, troponin was 0.05 x 2.
It is likely she had a cardiac event on POD 5.
Percocet 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every 4-6 hours as needed for pain for 4 weeks.
