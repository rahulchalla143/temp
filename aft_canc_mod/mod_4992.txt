Patient reportedly had no LOC and got back on his bike and continued riding.
Upon transfer patient was intubated for agitation and airway protection.
Father is at bedside and states that patient was an athlete but had been complaining of some dizziness and headaches prior to this incident.
Face symmetric Motor: moving all extremities spontaneously Toes mute bilaterally  Physical Exam upon Discharge: awake a+ox3 PERRL, EOMI decreased eye brow raise on right smile symmetric, tongue midline no pronator drift MAE's with 5/5 strengths sensation intact to light touch incision- well healing, [**Month/Day/Year 2729**] intact  ambulating independently, tolerating PO Diet, pain well controlled  Pertinent Results: [**9-10**] Head CT IMPRESSION: 1.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
No acute fracture.
Large, predominantly CSF-attenuation, cystic lesion with well-marginated medial border, centered in the right middle cranial fossa, likely representing an incidental arachnoid cyst.
No acute traumatic injury.
Bilateral lower lobe collapse.
Cannot exclude aspiration  [**9-10**] Brain MRI: IMPRESSION: Large non enhancing intra-axial mass in the right temporal lobe with local mass effect.
Appearances are consistent with a primary glial brain tumor.
Stable appearance of the right temporal lobe mass and associated mass effect.
CTA demonstrates no convincing vascular supply to the right temporal lobe mass.
Major venous sinuses are patent.
Possible arteriovenous malformation in the region of the left MCA bifurcation.
[**2169-9-14**] Brain MRI: IMPRESSION: Preoperative study performed as requested showing no interval change in the size and extent of the right temporal lobe tumor with local mass effect and mild midline shift to the left.
[**2169-9-15**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: Status post right craniotomy and right temporal lobe mass resection, now with expected subcutaneous gas and pneumocephalus; small focus of dense material may represent blood, but no large intraparenchymal or extra-axial hemorrhage.
[**2169-9-16**] Brain MRI: IMPRESSION: Postoperative changes of right temporal craniotomy without evidence of acute infarct, increase in mass effect or hydrocephalus.
Expected post-surgical changes with blood products in the surgical cavity and pneumocephalus as well as soft tissue swelling are identified in the surgical region.
He was started on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
CTA/CTV of the head was obtained to evaluate the blood supply of his R temporal tumor prior to his surgery on [**9-15**].
His pain medications were increased to every 3 hours as he continued to have some facial and rib pain,though his CT chest was negative for fracture.
The neuro-opthamology team was also consulted to obtain formal visual field testing given the location of his tumor and the risk of visual field deficit post operatively.
On [**9-14**] pt underwent MRI head with WAND study for pre-operative planning.
On [**9-15**] he underwent a right temporal craniotomy for evacuation and biopsy of his temporal lesion.
A routine post operative MRI was done which revealed good tumor resection and no hemorrhage or infarct.
He was started on Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **] for persistant elevated blood pressure and thorazine for hiccups.
He was ambulating independently and pain was well controlled.
He will follow up in the BTC once he has obtained insurance and will follow up with his PCP for following of his blood pressure.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Milk of Magnesia 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Constipation.
Chlorpromazine 25 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for persistent hiccups.
You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.
o	An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
?Please return to the office in [**7-8**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/[**Date Range 2729**] and a wound check.
Be sure to point out any incisions, which may be covered by clothing at the time of suture/staple removal.
