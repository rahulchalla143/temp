He was initially admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] for LGIB and chest pain.
He was transferred to the MICU for management of worsened LGIB and then returned to the general medicine floor after resolution of his LBIG.
#  NSTEMI: Patient has a history of CAD and previous NSTEMI with multiple stent placements.
He was admitted with severe angina on [**2171-9-4**] in the setting of a week of rectal bleeding.
He was found to have an elevated troponin level but a flat CK/CK-MB, which was attributed to demand ischemia in the setting of bleeding.
Notably, he had no ST depressions or elevation on EKG.
He had no further episode of angina while in the hospital and his EKG's remained unchanged.
#  GI bleeding: Patient reported a week of bloody stools prior to admission, but was admitted out of concern for NSTEMI after severe angina at home.
GI was consulted after he had another 100cc of BRBPR and they performed a sigmoidoscopy with demonstration of severe diverticulosis and active bleeding with a likely proximal colon source.
He received 2 additional units of blood and then underwent a repeat scope on [**9-7**] per Surgery's request, demonstrating diffuse diverticula without evidence of active bleeding.
After his hematocrit appeared to stabilize, he was transferred to the general medicine floor where he had non-bloody bowel movements and a rising Hct to 36.1.
# NSCLC: Patient has clincial stage II disease, s/p chemotherapy and radiation finished in [**2171-6-17**].
There were no active concerns in reference to his malignancy on this admission.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital due to concern for an internal bleed and a heart attack.
Gastroenterology was consulted to evaluate the source of your bleed and performed a colonoscopy showing small diverticula in your large bowel that were bleeding.
The bleeding has since resolved.
Once you are at home, if you notice any bloody bowel movements, blood in the toilet or on the toilet paper, feel lightheaded, dizzy, have chest pain or pressure, heart palpitations or feel like you might pass out, please call your primary care physician or go to the emergency room.
