Admission Date:  [**2140-3-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2140-3-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2080-2-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3227**] Chief Complaint: Weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**3-11**]: Left frontal craniotomy for mass resection   History of Present Illness: HPI:  Patient is a 60 yo man with PMH of metastatic lung ca,brain met s/p resection [**2140-2-7**], SDH s/p evacuation by craniotomy,bilateral pulmonary emboli, BPH and HTN who is known to the service from his crani and mass resection [**2140-2-7**].
Has been staying with his son and has been having fluctuating confusion and right sided weakness for the alst 1.5 weeks.
Was at its worst 2 days ago when he was drooling, confused and unable to lift his right hand of the bed.
Was taken to [**Hospital 5279**] Hospital where CT showed significant increase in edema with 1cm midline shift.
Patient reports slight frontal right sided headache intermittently since yesterday.
Past Medical History: #Hypertension #Lung Cancer Dx in [**1-14**] and was followed at the [**Hospital3 328**] until [**1-15**] when pt was found to have brains mets.
Pt presented with confusion and midline shift from assoc hematoma.
Now s/p L frontal craniotomy for subdural hematoma and metastatic dz.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Strength full power [**5-10**] throughout with the exception of 5- weakness in the right FE.
No pronator drift.
There is increased surrounding edema, but the degree of mass effect is unchanged.
There is approximately 9-10 mm of rightward shift of normally midline structures.
Of note, there is mildly increased central region of non-enhancement seen in the central regions of this lesion, suggesting increased necrosis, which may account for increasing size of the lesion.
There are no new lesions identified.
Minimal adjacent dural enhancement likely secondary to recent surgery.
IMPRESSION: Limited post-contrast T1 imaging performed for surgical planning purposes and demonstrates slightly increased size of surrounding edema in left frontal lobe enhancing mass.
No new lesions are identified.
Head CT [**3-11**](Post-op): FINDINGS: Postoperatively, there is a small amount of pneumocephalus adjacent to the left frontal craniotomy.
At the site of the prior soft tissue mass, there is a collection of low-density material mixed with air.
This surgical bed is lined by a thin rim of hyperdense material, likely reflecting a small amount of perioperative hemorrhage.
There is also a small amount of high-density material layering along the left frontal convexity adjacent to the craniotomy.
Extensive edema surrounding the surgical bed at the site of prior lesion is unchanged.
A small amount of rightward subfalcine herniation (9 mm) is also unchanged.
There are no new foci of intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no new edema or shift of normal structures.
There is no fracture.
The mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses remain well aerated.
IMPRESSION: Postoperative changes of the left frontal lobe with a small amount of pneumocephalus, and aerated low-density material in the surgical bed.
Small amount of acute blood lining the surgical bed and adjacent to the craniotomy.
No change in extensive edema and small amount of rightward subfalcine herniation.
No other acute abnormalities.
FINDINGS: The patient is status post resection of the left frontal lobe enhancing mass noted on the prior study.
Again identified is extensive left hemispheric edema with mass effect and midline shift.
There is a small amount of hemorrhage within the surgical bed, compatible with recent surgery.
Minimal enhancement at the surgical margins may represent post-operative enhancement, but the possibility of a small amount of residual tumor cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: 60M with known metastatic lung cancer transferred from [**Hospital 5279**] Hospital after he presented with altered mental status.
MRI of head was done showing mass recurrence in the left frontal lobe with significant vasogenic edema.
He was then taken to the OR on [**3-11**] for a craniotomy for mass resection.
On [**3-14**] he was started on heparin infusion to bridge his treatment for pulmonary emboli(previously diagnosed), with a goal ptt 50-70.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**7-15**] days (from your date of surgery) for a wound check.
