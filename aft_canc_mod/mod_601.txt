Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.

Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild mitral regurgitation.

Radiology Report UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US Study Date of [**2131-9-10**] 10:28 AM IMPRESSION: No evidence of right upper extremity DVT.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to appreciate given the bilateral increase in pleural effusion and perihilar opacities consistent with worsening of pulmonary edema.
The patient is after recent abdominal surgery.
Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2131-9-10**] 11:58 AM IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
STAPHYLOCOCCUS SPECIES.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.
Imaging at [**Location (un) 620**] noted an ileocolic intussuception that is likely due to a lead point of tumor or polyp.
This is causing a small bowel obstruction.
She agreed to surgery and went to the OR on [**2131-9-6**] for: Exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, ileocolic anastomosis, open cholecystectomy and transgastric feeding jejunostomy  Post-op Acute Respiratory Failure: Post-operatively she went into respiratory failure mid day.
TTE done by fellow [**Last Name (un) 16997**] Tan showed mild global hypokinesis and worsened TR (baseline 2+).
She received 1U PRBC for acute post-op blood loss anemia.
Post-op Atrial Fibrillation/Tachycardia: She was cardioverted in PACU for chronic afib with RVR to 120s as her BP dropped to 70s.
She was flipping between sinus 40-60s and afib with slow ventricular response to 40-60s.
Once on the floor, she had episodes of post-op bradycardia and so her Lopressor was held.
On POD 8, her Lopressor was restarted secondary to tachycardic episodes.
She went for imaging on [**9-10**] HEAD CT: No hemmorhage.
CXR: incr b/l effusion, worseing pulm edema vs. aspiration.
Abd: Her abdomen was soft and nontender.
Olanzapine 5 mg Tablet, Rapid Dissolve Sig: 0.5 Tablet, Rapid Dissolve PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for delerium.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) **] - [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Ileocolic intussusception secondary to submucosal mass, chronic cholecystitis with cholelithiasis.
