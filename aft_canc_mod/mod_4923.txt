Admission Date:  [**2154-1-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-1-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2091-1-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8487**] Chief Complaint: Sepsis, DIC  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation (at OSH)  History of Present Illness: 62y/o F with h/o COPD, CVA, + PPD [**12-27**] exposure to husband s/p INH course x9 months, dementia, EtOH, hypertension presented to OSH with increasing dyspnea.
Was recently d/c'ed with COPD exacerbation - treated with steroids and gatifloxacin.
One week later, c/o worsening dyspnea on [**12-29**].
Desatted, with episode of a fib with RVR - transferred to unit, treated with dig, lopressor, and dilt - converted to normal sinus.
She was found to have a RLL infiltrate on CXR.
Was on BiPAP initially, eventually intubated [**12-27**] worsening respiratory failure.
Had a chest CT with loculated R effusion, 2.2 cm RML spiculated mass and R axillary and supraclavicular LAD.
Head CT performed [**12-27**] MS changes - acute infarct in L frontal lobe.
Head CT 4 days later showed no change.
FFP, ?
Past Medical History: h/o TB exposure - INH x9 months lupus anticoagulant positive hypertension hyperlipidemia h/o CVA EtOH tobacco use   Social History: lives with one of her daughters.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: VS: 98.0 151/44 77 16 95% AC 450x16/7/0.5 Gen: not responsive to commands, intubated HEENT: PERRL CV: RRR, nl S1/S2, no m/r/g Pulm: clear bilaterally Abd: mildly distended, hypoactive bowel sounds Ext: dusky R foot with non-dopplerable pulses, purple R 3rd finger Neuro: does not open eyes on command   Pertinent Results: OSH Radiology Studies:  CT head without contrast [**12-31**] (OSH): c/w acute infarct, left frontal; atrophy with additional small areas of decreased attenuation c/w previous ischemic changes; R parietal temporal, L posterior parietal, deep central R parietal - c/w areas of previous infarct - no change from [**12-28**] .
CT chest with contrast [**12-31**] (OSH): anteriorly at R base, 2.2cm area of increased attenuation, possible rounded atelectasis but cannot exclude lung mass in RML; soft tissue prominence in R axilla, enhancing; soft tissue fullness in supraclavicular region on R c/w adenopathy .
Moderate loculated right pleural effusion.
Right paratracheal/suprahilar density, which may represent a mass or lymphadenopathy.
The right common femoral artery is patent as well, with a normal waveform, and without evidence of pseudoaneurysm.
Small amount of calcification is noted within the right common femoral artery.
No evidence of portal venous thrombosis.
The gallbladder is fairly distended with sludge and possible small amount shadowing stones within it.
There is no gallbladder wall thickening or edema, but there is a small amount of free fluid in the gallbladder fossa.
Right pleural effusion.
[**1-3**] Head CT: There are multiple moderate size areas of hypodensity in the cortex and subajcent white matter of both cerebral hemispheres.
These are associated with loss of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation and are suggestive of subacute-chronic infarcts.
The abnormal areas are in the frontal and parietal lobes bilaterally.
The distribution is consistent with embolic phenomenona but could be compatible with a watershed distribution as well.
There is no evidence of hemorrhagic transformation.
There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.
There was no evidence of acute bleeding, so FFP, platelets, and cryo were not given.
She was kept on respiratory precautions due to h/o TB exposure, and sputum cultures were ordered to r/o active pulmonary TB, given history.
It was thought that the patient's DIC and lupus anticoagulant, in addition to possibly being hypercoagulable [**12-27**] likely lung malignancy, placed Ms. [**Known lastname 65506**] at very high risk for arterial thrombosis, and vascular surgery recommended heparinization if possible.
Ms. [**Known lastname 65506**] was stable overnight until 6AM, when she became hypertensive and tachycardic to 160s, with ECG demonstrating afib with RVR.
She also appeared agitated, and was started on fentanyl and versed, after which she appeared more comfortable, and more hemodynamically stable.
In the morning, a repeat head CT was done, which revealed several large areas of hypoattenuation consistent with subacute stroke.
From the OSH head CT reports, which described small areas of old CVAs, this was thought to possible represent a progression with possible new or evolving infarcts.
Neurology was consulted, who recommended obtaining an MRI/MRA/MRV, given hypercoagulable status, maintaining SBP>140, and holding heparin in the context of possible ongoing stroke.
On auscultation, she had no respirations or heart sounds for two minutes, and had no palpable pulse over this time period.
She had no corneal reflex.
