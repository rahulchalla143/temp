There was no B/B loss.
His son states that the pt had been complaining yesterday of not feeling well, and had had a HA, but his son took his temperature and he was afebrile at 98F.
He states there have been no other seizures since his last discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] [**12-15**].
He was brought to [**Hospital3 15402**] Hosp, where he was found to have a fever to 102.4 F, and repeat NCHCT showed significant L sided vasogenic edema and 6 mm shift.
Past Medical History: PMH: - L-BG hemorrhage, w/ unusual features concerning for neoplasm - Migraines - Cervical epidural hematoma - Depression - HTN - renal failure (on HD in the past, off since [**2133**]), AV fistula.
- hepatitis C  with cryoglobulinemia, - Appendectomy.
- Seizures Type 1:  Presyncope Aura:  Numbness of body, darkening of vision Ictal:  Last for seconds, no loss of consciousness, improves if he sits down and lowers his head.
Ictal:  No loss of consciousness or confusion TB/incont:  None Postictal:  None First:  Several months ago Frequency:  One to two per week??????
- Divorced.
Very lethargic with hypophonia and psychomotor slowing.
(+) BTT B/L.. Extraocular movements cross midline bilaterally, no obvious nystagmus.

Non-Contrast CT Head ([**2135-2-5**]) PRELIM: Interval enlargement in left basal ganglia lesion with worsening surrounding vasogenic edema and two similar appearing foci in the left frontal lobe concerning for underlying neoplasm rather than purely hypertensive hemorrhage.
Mass effect with 7mm rightward midline shift.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-12-10**], trace aortic regurgitation is now seen in the presence of normal valve morphology.
If the clinical suspicion for endocarditis is moderate or high, a TEE is suggested to better define the aortic valve.
PATHOLOGY Note: Final note: The findings in aggregate are sufficient for a diagnosis of Glioblastoma (WHO grade IV).
CT head [**2135-2-9**] FINDINGS: Again seen is left frontal burr hole with mild soft tissue swelling and associated gas in the soft tissues, biopsy tract, and within the biopsied left basal ganglia lesion.
This lesion measures approximately 39 x 33 mm and again demonstrates hyperattenuating rim and hypodense center, with associated vasogenic edema.
There is no large area of acute hemorrhage.
There is unchanged mass effect with effacement of adjacent sulci and the left lateral ventricle, as well as unchanged rightward displacement of the normally midline structures by 7 mm.
There is no evidence of transtentorial or uncal herniation.
There is no large vascular territorial infarct.
Two satellite lesions with similar characteristics in the superior left frontal lobe are again visualized, measuring 18 x 12 and 13 x 9 mm.
There are no fractures.
IMPRESSION: No new hemorrhage.
Biopsied left basal ganglia mass and satellite lesions.
There is evidence of minimal enlargement of the perihilar vessels, potentially suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.
The pre-existing subtle retrocardiac parenchymal opacities have markedly decreased.
Currently, no safe evidence of focal parenchymal opacities suggesting an infectious disease are present.
No evidence of pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 487**] is a 57 year-old right-handed man with past medical history including hypertension, hepatitis C, cryoglobulinemia, CKD, and prior left basal ganglia hemorrhage thought to be concerning for underlying malignancy who presented to [**Hospital3 **] following seizure activity and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] after a non-contrast CT of the head revealed significant vasogenic edema surrounding the left basal ganglia mass lesion associated with midline shift.
The imaging was thought to show interval enlargement in left basal ganglia lesion with worsening surrounding vasogenic edema concerning for underlying neoplasm.
A routine EEG completed on [**2-11**] demonstrated diffuse encephalopathy without evidence of seizure activity or foci.
ID There was concern for underlying infection and/or the presence of a brain abscess given the ring-enhancing apperance of the left basal ganglia lesion and the patient's recent history of strep pneumonia bacteremia ([**12-15**]).
In the setting of chronic kidney disease and low suspician for HSV infection, the acyclovir was soon discontinued.
No vegetations, thrombi, masses, or septal defects were noted on a trans-thoracic echocardiogram.
He had diarrhea as well as mild abdominal pain.
A c. dif was negative x1, LFTs were normal with the exception of an AST of 78 and lipase of 81, and a plain film of his abdomen revealed no obvious pathology.
RENAL The patient has chronic renal disease and has been on hemodialysis in the past, but not recently.
His creatinine this hospitalization ranged from [**2-9**] which is consistent with his baseline and has been receiving gentle hydration.
Olanzapine 5 mg Tablet, Rapid Dissolve Sig: One (1) Tablet, Rapid Dissolve PO QHS (once a day (at bedtime)) as needed for agitation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: Malignant Left Basal ganglia/thalamic glioma Lesion based seizure disorder   Discharge Condition: Severe dysarthria, inattention.
Right upper motor neuron facial weakness.
Right arm with flaccid plegia, right leg with mild paresis.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after a seizure and were found to have a mass in a part of your brain called the basal ganglia.
A biopsy of the mass was found a malignant glioma, a type of brain tumor.
