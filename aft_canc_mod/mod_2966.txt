Admission Date:  [**2131-1-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-2-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2092-12-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Latex / Adhesive Tape  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**] Chief Complaint: DOE - Hodgkin's Lyphoma   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Chest Tube Placement/VATS   History of Present Illness: This is a 38 yo female with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma (diagnosed in [**2123**]) that involves her lungs, who presents with worsening respiratory function.
In [**Month (only) 359**] fo [**2129**] she was admitted to OSH for pneumonia and treated with abx.
Her respiratory symptoms continued.
She was noted to have a left pleural effusion by x-ray and this was tapped in [**2130-10-26**].
At that time only 200cc of dark fluid was removed (per the patient) and this did not relieve her symptoms at all.
She does have an occasional productive cough "when I get excited" and produces clear sputum.
This cough has been present since [**2130-6-26**].
She states that approximately 2 weeks ago she had a low grade temp and was treated for two weeks with Avelox (this was stopped on [**1-2**]).
The Avelox helped her dyspnea for the first week, but her symptoms got worse during the second week of treatment.
She also notes that approximately one week ago she developed a gastroenteritis (which she got from her son), and had two days of nausea/vomiting and diarrhea that have resolved.
She was seen in clinic today and noted to have DOE with walking short distances, RR 40 and hypotension with BPs 82/64.
Currently she is SOB with speaking but feels better since she has been placed on 4 L NC O2.
(+) for daily CP midsternal and under right breast (since [**Month (only) **] [**2129**]) (+) cough, described above (+) night sweats when she takes vicodin (+) pain in her bones (in her back mostly) for which she takes vcodin   Past Medical History: 1.
3. h/o herpes zoster.
4. per prior notes has history of Fen-Phen use.
Clot in left SVC that resulted in swelling of left breast, should be taking coumadin for this but stopped taking it last friday b/c she was upset 6. left pleural effusion  Oncology History: Diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, nodular sclerosing) in [**2123**].
The patient initially was treated with Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine with subsequent disease recurrence.
In [**2-/2130**] (about one year post transplant) a CT evaluation revealed recurrent disease in her chest and abdomen.
She underwent a biopsy of her anterior mediastinal adenopathy that revealed recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Father diagnosed just recently with pancreatic, liver and colon CA (primary ca not known)-also states father has cancer from asbestos   Physical Exam: VS: Tc 96.5 HR 145 BP 104/70 O2 sat 98% on 2L Gen: Young female with dyspnea while talking, but able to speak in full sentances HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric sclera, MMM, clear oropharynx Neck: supple, no LAD Cardio: tachy with reg rhythm, nl S1 S2, no m/r/g Pulm: CTA B but with decreased breath sounds on left side about halfway up lung with dullness to percussion as well, decrease breath sounds at right lung base Abd: soft, NT, +BS, mild tenderness in LLQ Ext: no edema Neuro: CN 2-12 intact, Muscle strength 5/5 in b/l upper and lower extremities Sensation to light touch intact   Pertinent Results: Imaging: [**2131-1-10**] CXR - Large amount of left pleural fluid which is worse in comparison to the previous study.
Small amount of right pleural fluid - unchanged in comparison to the previous film.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
[**2131-1-11**] Chest CT - Large left pleural effusion responsible for near-complete collapse of the left lung.
Small right pleural effusion.
Minimal pleural nodularity, but no evidence of loculation.
Extensive prevascular lymphadenopathy extending to and destroying portions of the sternum, left 1st through 3rd anterior ribs, and other left anterior chest wall structures.
Superior mediastinal lymphadenopathy with mild narrowing of the trachea at the thoracic inlet.
Right supraclavicular, paratracheal, subcarinal, paraesophageal, and diaphragmatic lymphadenopathy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
An echo dense mass is noted anterior to the heart/right ventricle outside the pericardial space.
[**2131-1-14**] Unilateral breast U/S - No fluid collections.
Right pleural effusion.
[**2131-1-14**] Unilateral L upper ext U/S - Abnormal finding in the left internal jugular area likely representing a necrotic lymph node and adjacent patent diminutive internal jugular vein.
Alternatively, if the patient has had prior procedures or radiation, this may represent chronic fibrosis with focal chronic thrombus.
If clinically indicated, this may be further evaluated with a contrast-enhanced neck CT.  [**2131-1-16**] CTA - No pulmonary embolism.
No consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
Unchanged bilateral masses and chest wall mass consistent with known metastatic disease  [**2131-1-17**] CTA - No pulmonary embolism.
No consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
Unchanged bilateral masses and chest wall mass consistent with known metastatic disease.
[**2131-1-20**] CXR - Overall stable appearance of the chest with no pneumothorax identified.
Stable position of the left chest tube.
[**2131-1-21**] CT Abdomen - Marked retroperitoneal and retrocrural lymphadenopathy.
Two soft tissue density nodules within the mesentery adjacent to the small bowel also likely represent areas of disease involvement.
No bowel obstruction.
[**2131-1-25**] CXR - Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions are again demonstrated with apparent loculation on the left.
Overall, since the recent radiograph of earlier the same date, there has not been a significant change in the appearance of the chest.
There are bilateral pleural effusions left greater than right.
There are bibasilar patchy areas of volume loss.
Hazy increased opacity in the left mid lung corresponds to known mediastinal mass with adjacent chest wall invasion.
Compared to the film from 2 days ago, the effusions are slightly smaller.
[**2131-1-29**] ECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-1-14**], the small pericardial effusion is more evident on this complete study.
[**2131-2-1**] CXR - No interval change in pleural effusions.
[**2131-2-5**] CXR - Mild pulmonary edema improved since [**1-28**] and 9.
Contraction of the left hemithorax is longstanding, and left lower lobe atelectasis has been stable since [**1-28**].
Small right and moderate left pleural effusion are unchanged.
Cardiac silhouette is partially obscured by adjacent pleural and parenchymal abnormality but not grossly changed from mild cardiomegaly in the interim.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 38 yo female with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma (diagnosed in [**2123**]) and with disease in her lungs, known left pleural effusion who presented with significant dyspnea on exertion.
She was admitted with known disease relapse and progression.
Most of her symptoms (pain, dyspnea on exertion, shortness of breath, breast swelling) were all thought secondary to disease infiltration.
*DOE:  Patient has had progressive DOE since [**Month (only) 216**].
Likely [**12-28**] to underlying Hodgkin's disease (some reports of paralyzed left diaphragm), pleural effusion and possible overlying PNA.
Recent PFTs done as outpatient showed FEV1 of 0.8, which suggested obstructive disease.
At admission she was tachypneic and febrile and started on empiric vancomycin and ceftriaxone for possible pneumonia.
Imaging done here with CXR and chest CT showed diffuse disease in chest and left sided pleural effusion with almost complete collapse of left lung.
Patient had tachypnea and pain post procedure.
Had O2 sats in low 90s, upper 80s and did not use much O2 because of history of bleomycin exposure.
She had a CTA to evaluate for PE and was negative.
She remained stable and was treated with morphine PCA and fentanly patch for pain control.
It was felt that the only way to further improve her symptoms was to treat the underlying disease.
During the later half of her hospital stay she was intermittently treated with lasix for SOB and put on a steroid taper of dexmethasone (on 2mg [**Hospital1 **] upon discharge).
Repeat X-rays showed improving pulmonary edema after lasix treatment.
(multiple ECHO's showed a normal EF)  *H/o left subclavian vein clot: Patient had a left subclavian clot several months prior to admission.
Her coumadin was held during the early part of her admission because she was scheduled to have a thoracentesis and then VATS and required an INR of <1.5 for these procedures.
Patient did have some swelling of left breast and left upper extremity.
Ultrasound of left uppper extremity showed: Abnormal finding in the left internal jugular area likely representing a necrotic lymph node and adjacent patent diminutive internal jugular vein.
Alternatively, if the patient had prior procedures or radiation, this could represent chronic fibrosis with focal chronic thrombus.
Breast ultrasound showed no fluid collections.
*Fevers: Patient had a fever a few weeks prior to admission and was treated with Avelox at that time.
Had fever at admission.
CXR showed large left pleural effusion and she was started on ceftriaxone and vancomycin for now for broad spectrum abx coverage to cover for possible PNA hidden behind the effusion.
She was treated with a 14 day course ([**Date range (2) 50855**]) with no further fevers.
The patient remained afebrile off antibiotics.
*Paralyzed vocal cords: Patient was found to have hoarse voice and paralyzed vocal cords in the ICU.
It was unclear if was secondary to VAT or her Hodgkin's disease affectling the recurrent laryngeal never.
*Anxiety - The patient had continued anxiety and depression throughout her hospital course.
Of note, she had an adverse reaction to IV ativan (hallucinations, confusion).
*Tachycardia: Pt had sinus tachycardia with unclear source.
Thought to be secondary to infection or dyspnea secondary to collapsed lung.
