This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to       hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..     FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2162-8-16**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary): Imaging: CXR [**8-11**]: Severe emphysematous changes are redemonstrated.
Again noted is a moderate-sized left pleural effusion, which may be slightly larger when compared to the prior study.
Worsening bibasilar air space opacities are noted which is concerning for infection or aspiration.
Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement is also noted.
There is no pneumothorax.
Small right pleural effusion is increased when compared to the prior study.
Extensive degenerative changes of the left glenohumeral joint are noted.
There is no pneumothorax.
Cardiac silhouette size is difficult to assess given the presence of bibasilar air space opacities and bilateral pleural effusions.
Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta with atherosclerotic calcifications is again noted.
Worsening bibasilar air space opacities which is concerning for infection or aspiration.
Moderate-sized left and small right pleural effusions.
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
Severe emphysema.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Bilateral lungs are hyperinflated consistent with extensive emphysema changes.
Left pleural effusion has significantly reduced and there is residual minimal pleural effusion with atelectasis of the underlying lung.
Mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged basal atelectasis.
Mild interstitial thickening is seen in the left mid and bilateral lung bases suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.
There is mild cardiomegaly.
Brief Hospital Course: 83F with COPD oh home O2, severe systolic and diastolic CHF (EF=25%), squamous cell lung CA was admitted with  dyspnea x 1 week that worsened acutely on the day of admission.
# Dyspnea - Patient's dyspnea was thought to be multifactorial but was consistent with flash pulmonary edema/acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure.
The patient was initially started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for possibility of pneumonia, but she remained afebrile and exhibited no signs of infection, so antibiotics were discontinued.
Serial cardiac enzymes were negative for acute MI.
Despite diuresis, she continued to have a large right pleural effusion of unclear etiology.
Interventional pulmonary performed a thoracentesis and pigtail catheter placement and drained approximately 1 L of fluid, most suggestive of transudate BUT pleural fluid CYTOLOGY is still PENDING.
After drainage, her oxygen requirement decreased to 1L NC and the pigtail catheter has been removed.
She had intermittent episodes of anxiety and was started on oral morphiine solution.
# Hypertension - She was quite hypertensive per report of the EMTs who arrived at her home.
# Anemia - She has been chronically anemic and her hematocrit remained stable.
She had no signs of active bleed.
# Urinary retention: Throughout her hospital course, she had a few episodes of urinary retention ("feeling that she had to urinate but couldn't go").
This was likely due to severe constipation.
She is now able to void without difficulty.
A UA was negative for infection.
# Glaucoma - She was continued on her eye drops (pilocarpine, brimonidine, timolol, latanprost).
I discussed in detail what we would do, the likely futility of the attempts given her severe heart failure, lung CA, and other medical problems, and the very low probability that whe would be able to come off the ventilator if she needed intubation.
Clearly this issue should be re-discussed with her and her daughter periodically given the very poor prognosis of her severe heart failure combined with severe emphysema, lung cancer, and renal failure as well as her age.
She will need: -daily weights -daily physician or NP/PA review of her clinical status and medication regimen -monitoring of her renal function in the setting of diuresis -availability of chest X-Ray for evaluation of decreasing sats - DDX includes pulmonary edema, re-development of pleural effusion (lower likelyhood if she is maintained on the "dry" side as she is now), PNA.
Would transfuse only if she is symptomatic or if her Hct drops below 22%, though we leave this to the discretion of the [**Hospital1 1501**] physician.
15. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for insomnia.
21. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
22. camphor-menthol 0.5-0.5 % Lotion Sig: One (1) Appl Topical QID (4 times a day) as needed for itchiness to back.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute exacerbation of systolc heart failure Severe, O2-dependent COPD (emphysema) Squamous cell lung CA Acute renal failure in the setting of aggressive diuresis Acute on chronic anemia Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
No recent changes have been made to her anti-hypertensive regimen, but should be considered if her BP continues to run low.
Given her severe systolic heart failure, we would be very cautious about transfusing blood products due to concern about heart failure exacerbation.
She is on chronic low flow O2 (1-2L by NC) for her severe emphysema.
