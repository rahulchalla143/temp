No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is no significant change in the left basal consolidation and at least partially loculated left pleural effusion including the apical component.
There is a lucency projecting over the left apical fluid collection that may represent small loculated pneumothorax.
Soft tissue density mass posterior to the tracheostomy catheter was seen on prior CT scan and is consistent with patient's metastatic esophageal cancer.
Multiple right-sided right lung as well as right pleural nodules concerning for progression of metastatic disease on that side.
Overall stable appearance to extensive pleural as well as parenchymal metastatic disease in the left lung.
Nodular foci in the right and left lungs, however, could also represent foci of infectious process and would recommend followup to assess for change or resolution.
CT Neck: Ill-defined soft tissue associated with the esophagus in the post-cricoid region and hypopharynx in the area of prior FDG avidity.
Brief Hospital Course: 40 yo F with metastatic esophageal carcinoma s/p recent initiation of carboplatin and 5fu, s/p trach in past, admitted to oncology with febrile neutropenia and transferred for concerning increased stridor and narrowed airway.
## Stridor: Patient with history of stridor in past, leading to trach in [**10-25**] for esophageal perforation possibly in setting of nausea/vomiting and laryngeal edema.
Recent PET scan with increased uptake in this area.
Pt received IV decadron without improvement.
# Neutropenic fever/sepsis: Patient spiking fevers to 101 on cefepime on the floor.
She also spiked fever subsequently after coming back from the OR.
She compleated the antibiotic course in house and was afebrile afterwards.
# Sinus tachy: has been ongoing issue per last discharge summary, has been ranging in 120s in past, is of unknown etiology.
Has been persistent despite fluid resuscitation, transfusion, and correction of hypercalcemia in past.
It is possible that this could be secondary to vagus nerve infiltration of her tumor, leading to unopposed sympathetic stimulation.
# Metastatic esophageal cancer: with mets to lungs, recent PET scan showed increased disease in lung, upper esophagus, and paratracheal region.
As per family meetings while in the ICU, the plan is to give her 2 week holiday and then assess and consider palliative chemotherapy.
# Left flank/back pain: Likely secondary to mets.

Disp:*250 Mililiters* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 269**] Hospice Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Respiratory Distress/Failure secondary to either chemical irritation of the airway or esophageal cancer infiltration to the esophagus.
Secondary Diagnosis: Esophageal strictures and webs.
Discharge Instructions: You were seen at the [**Hospital1 18**] for neutropenic fever after your chemotherapy.
Upon arrival you mentioned that you had been having difficulty breathing during the last days.
You were seen by the ENT, who saw a very narrow arway.
You were evaluated by speech and swallow, but everytime you had any liquids you started coughing and there is risk of aspiration and food/liquids going down the wrong pipe.
