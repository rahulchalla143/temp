Admission Date:  [**2167-8-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2167-9-3**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bleomycins / Strawberry / Pineapple  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 477**] Chief Complaint: s/p fall  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 85M with PMH of both Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins lymphoma currently on chemo who presented to an OSH after a fall in his driveway, pt was noted to be febrile and tachycardic in ED so transferred to ICU for further evaluation and work-up.
He reports that he bumped his head in the fall.
He was initially taken to [**Hospital3 **] where an EKG was performed that was concerning for ST-segment elevations.
EKG was notable for sinus tachycardia to the 140s.
A CT scan of C/A/P was done in the ED that was negative for pulmonary emboli and intra-abdominal pathology but he was noted to have a small-moderate pericardial effusion.
The patient was again noted to have an elevated white blood cell count with a bandemia of 8%.
Past Medical History: HODGKIN LYMPHOMA: Relapsed disease:  In [**2165-12-9**], he was markedly symptomatic with fatigue, feeling lousy, and weight loss.Bone marrow examination in [**Month (only) **] showed extensive involvement by Hodgkin lymphoma.
He had poor appetite and worsening anemia.
He had an immediate reaction to the bleomycin and did not received further bleomycin.
In [**2165-4-8**], repeat bone marrow showed no evidence of lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease either by flow cytometry or by histology.
NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA: Mr. [**Known lastname 23552**] had been previous treated first for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and later for Hodgkin's disease.
Herb presented initially with a low grade lymphoma/massive splenomegaly.
His symptoms, fatigue and loss of appetite, resolved.
In [**2163-5-10**] Herb began a course of Rituxan x 4 as part of a maintenance program.
OTHER ISSUES: He had a right leg common femoral artery to posterior tibial bypass by the [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] surgery service, and then had a successful right lower vein graft angioplasty ([**December 2166**]).
No further syncopal issues.

with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for review) of [**2166-7-28**], the right ventricle is no longer dilated and globally hypocontractile.
INDICATION: Fever, tachycardia and fall.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained without oral or IV contrast as the patient could not tolerate fluids and had a recent IV contrast.
CT Abdomen: There is a moderate-sized pericardial effusion.
There is atherosclerotic calcification in the thoracic aorta.
There is mild dependent atelectasis at the lung bases.
There is [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] calcification of the aorta, the splenic artery, the origin of the SMA and the renal arteries as well as the common, external and internal iliac arteries.
There is no free fluid, free air, or adenopathy.
There is a Foley in the bladder.
There is no free fluid, inguinal or pelvic adenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: There is degenerative change in the lumbar spine.
The minimally displaced right 12th rib fracture is again noted.
No acute intra-abdominal process.
Male w/ Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma undergoing chemotherapy with Gemzar/[**Hospital 23553**] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from OSH for questionable ST elevation s/p fall, transferred to Oncology following negative fever, cardiac work up now with unsteady gait likely [**1-10**] hospitalization, asymptomatic atrial tachycardia.
# Fever, hypotension, leukocytosis with bandemia: Upon admission to the ICU pt was noted to have a low BP, tachycardia, fevers and leukocytosis meeting SIRS.
Pt was hydrated with IV fluids, work up included a CT chest/abdomen scan which showed a small pericardial effusion, no evidence of pulmonary embolism, no intraabdominal process.
Following negative cultures, and fevers in spite of antibiotic therapy, pt's fevers were attributed to his Lymphoma and his leukocytosis with bandemia was atrributed to the pt's recent Neulasta treatment prior to admission.
Prior to discharge pt was afebrile with leukocytosis only returning with onset of Neupogen.
# Atrial Tachycardia: During hospitalization pt has intermittently going into Atrial Tachycardia usually with a heart rate in the 120s, he has been asymptomatic during these episodes and this may have been the inciting event for the pt's fall on admission.
In the ICU pt was started on an Esmolol drip which showed no effect, pt spontaneously went back into sinus after it was discotninued.
Since his transfer to the Oncology floor Cardiology has been following the patient, it is unclear as to the cause of the pt's Atrial tachycardia or how long he has had these episodes for.
# Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Pt's primarty oncologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], prior to discharge pt was started on his 19th cycle of gemzar/navelbine.
# History of PE: Pt is currently on coumadin for his history of Pulmonary Embolism.
# Renal Insufficiency; Pt has a history of renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine 1.2-1.3.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Atrial Tachycardia, Hodgkin's Lymphoma Secondary Diagnoses: - Renal Insufficiency - Hypertension - Peripheral [**Location (un) **] Disease - H/O Pulmonary Embolism and Right DVT on warfarin   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile.
Whilst in the ICU our tests showed you didn't have a heart attack but your heart rate was beating fast.
During your hospital stay you had difficulty walking with full strength which is why we recommended you got to a rehabilitation facility.
You also experienced some fevers which we believe is due to your cancer.
