There is no pathology in our system and the note that refers to this documents that this occurred circa [**2105**].

[**6-7**]: TTE: Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There is a mild coarctation of the distal aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**6-9**]: CXR IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**6-9**]: RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale, color, and spectral Doppler analysis were performed.
There is no evidence of thrombus in the right internal jugular vein, right subclavian vein, right axillary vein, and right brachial vein.
There is thrombus in the mid right cephalic vein extending distally to the level of the antecubital fossa.
No right upper extremity deep venous thrombosis.
[**6-12**]: TEE: Conclusions: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are complex (>4mm non mobile) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No vegetation or abscess seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 yo m with PMH DM, HTN, carcinoid tumor, hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism on Ca supplements, recent adm for hypercalcemia presents with fever and found to have cellulitis at prior IV site.
Fever/cellulitis: The patient initially presented with what seemed to be a local cellulitis in the right antecubital fossa, but given that the patient was also febrile on admission, blood cultures were obtained which ended up growing out MSSA.
Additionally, to evaluate the patient for possible endocarditis, he received a TTE first which suggested aortic valve vegetations, but a TEE only showed evidence of aortic plaques, no vegetations and no evidence of abscess.
An ultrasound of the antecubital fossa showed a superficial thrombophlebitis.
Infectious Disease consult was involved and recommended a total of 4 weeks of nafcillin from the date of last positive blood culture ([**6-4**]).
Mild Transaminitis: the patient had a mild bump in his liver function tests soon after starting nafcillin.
CRI: the patient had a small bump in his creatinine on admission, likely secondary to relative volume depletion in setting of insensible losses with fever.
DM: The patient's metformin was held in the setting of bacteremia out of concern for acidemia.
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 3 ml IV DAILY:PRN Peripheral IV - Inspect site every shift   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 4657**] - [**Location 1268**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Cellulitis Bacteremia (MSSA) Status Post Nafcillin Desensitization .
Secondary Type 2 Diabetes Hypoparathyroidism Hypothyroidism Rectal Carcinoid Tumor   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because of a skin infection around the site of a peripheral IV.
The bacteria managed to enter your blood stream and therefore we needed to rule out bacterial invasion of the heart, which was ruled out by transesophageal echocardiography.
If you experience fevers, chills, shortness of breath or chest pain, please seek medical attention.
