Admission Date:  [**2152-10-28**]     Discharge Date:  [**2152-11-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2106-6-1**]     Sex:  M   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 46-year-old male with known metastatic renal cancer and known portal vein thrombosis and biliary obstruction with esophageal varices, diagnosed in [**2152-4-2**], who was transferred from an gastrointestinal bleed.
At that time, he complained of nausea and vomiting times three days, hematemesis, and melena times two days.
He was noted to have hematemesis in the Emergency Department and his admission hematocrit was 20.1.
[**3-5**]+ esophageal varices without acute bleed and without stigmata of bleed.
There was an adherent clot with normal underlying mucosa.
Patient was witnessed to have around 500 cc of bright red blood with clots in route.
Also, had bright red blood per rectum at that time.
Metastatic renal cell carcinoma, status post right nephrectomy in [**2139**], status post high dose IL-2 therapy in [**2141**], status post right pulmonary nodule resection in [**2143**] and status post high dose IL-2 therapy in [**2149**], then status post IL-12 with IL-2 in [**Month (only) **] to [**2151-11-3**].
Went through one and a half cycles and stopped secondary to personal reasons, status post thalidomide from [**2152-5-2**] to present.
Biliary obstruction, status post biliary stent in [**2152-4-2**] which was replaced by a new biliary stent in [**2152-4-2**].
Peripheral neuropathy secondary to thalidomide.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No tobacco and no alcohol.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema, warm, 2+ distal pulses and pale (that was the physical examination from the first progress note on [**10-29**], no physical examination from the [**10-28**] night float admission note).
Abdominal CT on [**2152-8-14**] masses at pancreatic and peripancreatic region, masses of adrenals bilaterally, splenomegaly with a splenic mass, splenic vein obliterated by tumor with collateral varices, status post right nephrectomy, lesion of left kidney, inguinal and pelvic lymph nodes, no free fluid and persistent extrinsic occlusion of the portal vein.
Malignant looking common bile duct stricture with multiple filling defects and a 7 cm stent was placed.
Electrocardiogram on [**10-27**] at outside hospital with sinus tachycardia at 122, axis 61, intervals 125.84.419 corrected.
No ST elevation or depression.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This was a 46-year-old man with metastatic renal cancer with known esophageal varices and portal hypertension, secondary to extrinsic compression of the portal system by the mass and portal vein thrombosis who presented to an outside hospital with an upper gastrointestinal bleed thought to be secondary to gastric varices.
Upper gastrointestinal bleed:  The patient with endoscopy at outside hospital, negative for stigma of variceal bleed, most likely secondary to gastric varices.
Despite this, patient continues to have active bleeding.
Patient was planned to have abdominal ultrasound and then Gastrointestinal and Interventional Radiology to evaluate.
A multiphasic CT showed unchanged metastases with portal vein flow distally but minimal flow proximally.
He developed a left lower lobe pneumonia, believed to be due to an aspiration pneumonia during patient's intubation.
Difficult with extubation, secondary to low oxygen saturation.
Patient was later found to have an abnormally high AA gradient and also a VQ mismatch.
This was believed to possibly be secondary to small pulmonary emboli being sent from patient's existent left popliteal deep vein thrombosis.
During the procedure, it was discovered that patient's inferior vena cava was abruptly tapered secondary to extrinsic compression by tumor.
During patient's intubation, he was agitated on his vent, and, therefore, started on propofol at which time he became hypotensive and required Neo-Synephrine in order to maintain blood pressure.
Patient also experienced acute renal failure likely secondary to the dye load given during a CT and angio procedure during the admission.
Upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to gastric varices.
Renal cell cancer with metastases.
Deep vein thrombosis, status post internal and external biliary stent, status post portal vein stent and peripheral neuropathy.
Addendum: Patient developed moderate abdominal discomfort shortly after arrival home and was told by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to uncap the biliary drain and resume external drainage.
