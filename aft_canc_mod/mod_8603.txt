Admission Date:  [**2124-4-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2124-5-12**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: Chest Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation.
History of Present Illness:    This is an 87 year-old male with history of 3 vessel coronary disease, congestive heart failure, aortic stenosis, diabetes, end-stage renal disease not on dialysis who presents with ST elevation infarction.
He had been having intermittent chest pain with exertion that resolved with rest for the past month.
The morning of admission, he had [**8-13**] burning substernal chest pain with intermittent radiation to the left chest.
He came into the emergency department and was found to have ST elecations inferiorly.
It was felt that he had collateral insufficiency given inferior ST elevations in the setting of a known occluded right coronary.
His chest pain resolved in the emergency department, and he was transferedd to the CCU.
Upon arrival to the CCU, he complained of persistent burning substernal chest pain, and he EKG had persistent ST elevations inferiorly with ST elevations in V4 with right-sided leads.
He became acutely hypoxic to the 80s on a non-rebreather.
A bedside echocardiogram showed severely depressed left ventricular function with preserved right ventricular function.
After discussions with his outpatient nephrologist, covering cardiologist, and daughters, he was taken emergently to the catherization lab for a diagnostic and potentially therapeutic catherization despite the risk of needing dialysis after the [**Month/Year (2) **] load.
He was started on pressors for cardiogenic shock.
Catherization revealed severe stenosis at the left main trifucation.
Coronary artery disease status post an MI [**47**] years ago.
A catherization in [**2115**] showed severe 3 vessel disease.
Persantine-MIBI on [**4-18**] showed fixed inferior and inferiolateral perfusion defect.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 19% on persantine-MIBI [**2124-4-18**].
Aortic Stenosis with a gradient of 41 mmHg in [**5-8**].
Diabetes that is diet controlled.
End stage renal disease not on dialysis.
Hiatal hernia with gastroesophageal reflux.
Prostate cancer with watchful waiting.
Pulmonary: Bibasilar crackles anteriorly.
Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, s1, s2, with III/VI harsh systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur heard thoughout.
Abdomen: Soft, mildly nondistended with decreased bowel sounds.
Dopplerable dorsalis pedis on the right and posterior tibial on the left.
EKG [**2124-4-21**]: Normal sinus rhythm with ST elevations in III and aVF and ST depressions in I, aVL, V2-V4.
Right sided leads had ST elevations in V4R.
The LAD had a 90% stenosis at the origin and a 70% stenosis at the mid-portion.
The D1 had a 95% ostial stenosis.
The circumflex had moderate disease without any critical lesions.
His right ventricular end diastolic pressure was elevated at 20 mmHg, and his wedge was elevated at 30 mmHg.
CXR [**2124-5-11**]: IMPRESSION: Increasing cardiomegaly with worsening moderate pulmonary edema denote cardiac decompensation.
Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 87 year-old gentleman with known 3 vessel coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure EF 25%, aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.9 cm2), diabetes who presented with an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction secondary to collateral insufficiency.
He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with complaints of chest pain and found to have significant CAD based on a Persantine MIBI test, however a cardiac catheterization could not be performed given the severe acute on chronic renal failure.
This particular hospitalizations was complicated by multiple factors including cardiogenic shock, septic shock, repeated episodes of aspiration PNA, and flash pulmonary edema.
After his last episode of hypoxic respiratory failure and intubation/extubation, the pt was made DNR/DNI after long discussions with the patient and his family.
However he suffered another episode of respiratory distress during which time he was made [**Hospital1 3225**] after discussion with the patient and the HCP.
However, this hospitalization for STEMI was complicated by episodes of shock and hypoxic respiratory distress requiring intubation/extubation after which point the patient was made DNR/DNI.
However he experienced another episode of respiratory distress from pulmonary edema on the evening of [**2124-5-10**].
In addition, the pt was written for PRN nebulizers and promethazine.
STEMI: His inferior infarction was attributed to collateral insufficiency.
Initially, there was concern for right ventricular involvement.
Catherization confirmed severe 3 vessel disease.
After catheterization, the patient did not have any complaint of chest pain, nor did he have concerning EKG changes.
Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: His initial respiratory failure was likely secondary to cardiogenic shock in the setting of his ST elevation myocardial infarction.
Post-procedure, he developed copious amounts of dark thick sputum.
At that time, he developed a fever and a white count.
He was presumed to have an aspiration pneumonia as below.
As his shock resolved, he became more hypertensive with elevated pulmonary artery pressures.
At that time, he had evidence of pulmonary edema.
On hospital day 9, he had an episode of hypoxia in the setting of hypertension that was consistent with flash pulmonary edema.
A chest x-ray showed marked increased in bilateral pulmonary edema.
His symptoms improved with diuresis.
On [**5-5**] he developed respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary edema and likely aspiration pneumonia, which was treated with triple antibiotics.
His pulmonary edema responded poorly to attempted diuresis.
Given poor prognosis decision was made with the family to move toward comfort care/hospice.
Shock: Initially, he had evidence of cardiogenic shock with a low cardiac index on dopamine.
On hospital day 3, he had evidence of septic shock give and elevated cardiac index with a low systemic vascular resistance.
He had developed a fever to 101.3 and a white count of 22.
He was started empirically of vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl for a presumed aspiration pneumonia and completed a 10 day course.
On hospital day 9, he had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate with associated hypotension.
In the setting of septic shock, he became total body fluid overloaded and required diuresis with Lasix.
He did go into flash pulmonary edema on [**5-5**] which eventually resolved.
This rise was likely from decreased renal perfusion.
As he was weaned off of the pressors and as his blood pressure improved, his urine output increased with a subsequent decrease in his creatinine.
Dialysis was discussed with patient and family but this was not consistent with his known wishes.
After several days, a abdominal plain film showed dilated colonic loops.
An abdominal CT confirmed the dilated loops of bowel and showed no signs of obstruction.
Surgery was consulted and felt that this was consisted with ileus likely secondary to the fentanyl during sedation.
Repeat abdominal plain films showed no further dilatation.
Aortic stenosis: He has severe aortic stenosis with a gradient of 64 mmHg and a valve area of 0.9.
Diabetes: His blood glucose was slightly elevated during the initial periods of septic shock.
He had peripheral IVs.
Eventually he underwent video speech and swallow evaluation which revealed delayed laryngeal closure; it was recommended that he try ground solids and thickened liquids.
Soon after beginning this, he had likely aspiration event leading to PNA (see above).
He continues to be at high risk for aspiration.

He should be followed as necessary in the facility for titration of his pain medications.
