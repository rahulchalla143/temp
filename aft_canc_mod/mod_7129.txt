While antibiotics were being given, patient developed hypotension to 40/20s, and was given 1 mg epinephrine IV, out of concern for anaphylaxis, which resulted in narrow-complex tachycardia.
EKG at the time showed ST segment elevation in the inferior leads.
Bedside TEE performed showing hyperdynamic ventricle with poor filling.
After a first DC shock of 200J, there was initial return of sinus bradycardia, which degenerated into VT again.
The patient then was noted to be pulseless and received CPR for 3-5 minutes with resultant ROSC.
EKG following the arrest showed sinus tachycardia, with less then 1mm ST elevations in inferior leads and persistent ST depressions in anterior precordial leads.
During this episode, the patient developed a diffuse pink, blanching rash.
Symptomatic uterine fibroids: had caused pain in the past, and patient was recommended to have TAH due to size of fibroids 2.)
Hyperlipidemia   Social History: Lives at home in [**Location (un) 86**] with two daughters.
No known chemical exposures.
Family History: Mother, still living, with DM and HTN.
No family history of cardiovascular disease or anaphylaxis.
No family history of sudden cardiac death.

EKG [**2184-10-4**] (#1): sinus tach with inferior and lateral ST elevations EKG [**2184-10-4**] (#2): sinus tach with new Q-waves in inferior leads  Brief Hospital Course: Briefly, the pt is a 54 yo F who presented initially on day of admission for an elective hysterectomy for symptomatic uterine fibroids.
Prior to surgery, following intubation and administration of IV Cefazolin, the patient developed hypotension to the 40's/20's.
Then given IV epinephrine with subsequent development of narrow-complex tachycardia, which degenerated into VT/VF, with  unsuccessful debibrillation, subsequent PEA arrest, received CPR for approximately 4 minutes and return of spontaneous circulation.
Of note, during this incident, pt had 2 bedside echocardiograms done showing some inferior wall hypokinesis, and EKG's showed initially some ST elevations that resolved but with some new inferior Q waves.
During the episode, the pt was noted to have a diffuse body rash, which responded to Benadryl and famotidine.
# Anaphylactic Shock: given the patient's acute hypotension and rash following administration of IV cefazolin, the pt is presumed to have a severe allergy to cephlasporins.
Following the acute episode in the OR, the patiet remained hemodynamically stable without any pressors or aggressive IVF.
The patient and her daughter were informed that she has a severe allergic, potentially fatal, reaction to cephlasporins.
She has been instructed to abstain from cephlasporins and penicillins, and to avoid antibiotics in general if possible for now, until she follows-up in [**Hospital 9039**] Clinic after discharge.
She may need further allergen testing once the acute phase of her anaphylaxis has resolved.
She also received a prescription  for Epipen's, and was instructed on how to administer and also given an informational handout.
Furthermore, if she did have symptoms consistent with anaphylactic shock, Epipen would be the appropriate immediate treatment.
A tryptase level is currently still pending.
# VT arrest:  The patient developed VT/VF following her anaphylactic shock and administration of IV epinephrine, and was noted to have some wall motion abnormality on bedside Echo, EKG changes, and elevated troponin.
As such, Cardiology felt it was very unlikely for the patient to have underlying coronary artery or structural heart disease.
She may also need to have her lipids rechecked in the outpatient setting given a reported prior history of dyslipidemia.
She will need to continue on Aspirin for 2 weeks and have a outpt exercise-stress echocardiogram, which has already been scheduled, and follow-up with Cardiology after the stress testing.
She also has a pending tryptase level that may aid in the confirmation of her diagnosis of anaphylaxis reaction to cephlasporins.
She will follow-up with her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] she has pending culture data, including a MRSA screen, blood culture, urine culture, and catheter-tip culture.
EpiPen 0.3 mg/0.3 mL Pen Injector Sig: One (1) injection Intramuscular once as needed for anaphylaxis - shortness of breath, tongue swelling, rash, low blood pressure: please keep 1 injection on you at all times or in your purse, keep 1 in your car or your house.
Disp:*2 injectors* Refills:*1*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Anaphylactic allergic reaction medication Ventricular Tachycardia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You presented to the hospital for an elective GYN surgery for fibroids, however, prior to your sugery, your developed an anaphylactic allergic reaction with low blood pressure to an antibiotic (cefazolin) and also developed a cardiac arrest, requiring CPR and electric shocks.
There were some mild abnormalities seen on ultrasound of the heart, so the cardiologists recommend that you take Aspirin for the next 2 weeks.
The Epipen is to be used if you develop any reaction similar to what you experienced here in the hospital, with low blood pressure, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, rash.
