Admission Date:  [**2192-5-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2192-5-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2124-6-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Verapamil  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10323**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath, chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 67 year old man with a history of metastatic pancreatic cancer and hx of DVT diagnosed in [**Month (only) 958**] on Lovenox 1mg/kg [**Hospital1 **] who is admitted following CT Torso today to assess for progression pancreatic cancer that showed bilateral PEs with possible right heart strain.
At time of diagnosis, he did have right lower extremity tenderness.
Since initiation of lovenox, the patient has taken it meticulously at 8am and 8pm daily and lower extremity pain has long resolved.
However, this Saturday morning (4 days PTA), he awoke with intermittent sharp stabbing right sided chest pain (non-pleuritic), associated with right-sided abdominal pain radiating around his side.
Chest pain did not radiate.
Pain was associated with dyspnea on exertion on climbing 1 flight of stairs and occasional palpitatons.
No lightheadedness/dizziness or syncope.
The patient was evaluated by his oncologist, who increased his fentaynl patch for radiating abdominal pain, and referred him for a CT torso with contrast to evaluate for progression of disease.
CT showed multiple segmental pulmonary emboli, and thrombus surrounding the tip of his porto-cath extending into his low SVC.
The patient states that chest pain currently resolved.
He denies shortness of breath at rest, calf tenderness, palpitations.
Abdominal pain well controlled on fentanyl patch (due to be changed [**5-10**]).
No recent fevers, chills.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI; recent history of constipation, improved on increase in bowel regimen (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies cough or wheezing.
Denies abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark or bloody stools.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
Past Medical History: - IPMN - adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (see below) - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Elevated PSA since approx [**2179**] with 4 negative Bx - Microscopic hematuria - Colon polyps (benign) (last colonoscopy [**2187**], planned 5-year follow-up) - Glaucoma (mild, low tension) - Nephrolithiasis - h/o tendonitis (R index) - Diverticulosis - Lumbar disc disease - Ventral hernia - h/o positive PPD - s/p fusion of lower spine ([**2179**]) .
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - [**10-17**] diagnosed with IPMN - [**1-/2192**]: admitted to [**Hospital1 112**] with intense, crampy abdominal pain.
MRI showed a lesion in the uncinate head of the pancreas.
- [**2192-2-16**]: EUS done at [**Hospital1 18**] showed a 2.5 x 2.5 cm mass in the uncinate process of the pancreas as well as several cysts.
Biopsy of the mass in the tail continued to show mucinous fluid, consistent with IPMN.
Liver and pancreatic biopsies were taken and he was proven to have adenocarcinoma in the liver.
ERCP was done with sphincterotomy and CBD stent placed - [**2192-4-16**]: Gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 day 8 - [**2192-4-23**]: day 15 Gemcitabine HELD due to dehydration - [**2192-5-1**]: Gemcitabine given  Social History: Originally from [**Location (un) 4708**].
Family History: Older brother died of pancreatic cancer in his 60s.
[**Name (NI) **] brother died of lung cancer at age 53.
Father had DM and possible heart disease.
No family history of hypercoagulability.
Physical Exam: Physical Exam: Vitals:  BP 154/81  P 101  O2 99%RA General: Pleasant, Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, + S4 and loud P2 Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi Abdomen: soft, non-distended, bowel sounds present, + hepatomegaly, no tenderness to palpation, no rebound or guarding  GU: no foley Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema; no calf tenderness Neuro: CNII-XII intact, 5/5 strength upper/lower extremities, grossly normal sensation, 2+ reflexes bilaterally, gait deferred.
Bilateral pulmonary emboli with occlusion of the right lower lobe pulmonary artery, new from [**2192-4-6**].
Eccentric thrombus in the left lower lobe pulmonary artery suggests that this portion may be subacute, but it is still new from [**2192-4-6**].
There is no definite evidence of right heart strain.
Heterogeneous opacity in the right lower lobe with extension into the right middle lobe may represent aspiration, infection or right lower lobe infarct.
Filling defect at the inferior tip of the Port-A-Cath within the SVC may be due to thrombus at the tip, less likely due to mixing of contrast.
Interval increase in size of numerous hepatic hypodensities, consistent with metastatic disease.
The pancreatic head adenocarcinoma is similar to [**2192-4-6**].
A hypodense lesion in the pancreatic tail is likely a side branch IPMN, which is slightly larger, possibly due to progressive ductal obstruction.
Fat stranding in the right upper quadrant omentum may represent post-surgical or post-radiation change, but omental metastasis is not excluded.
Partially occlusive thrombus in the mid superficial femoral vein on the left.
ECHO:  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is a 1.6 x 1.7 round, mildly mobile echogenic mass in the right atrium, likely representing the extension of a known catheter-associated thrombus.
An independent pathology, such as myxoma or other tumor cannot be entirely excluded.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate-sized right atrial mass, likely thrombus.
No PFO or ASD seen.
