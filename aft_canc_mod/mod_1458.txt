# B/L Lower Extremity Heal Ulcers: after the aforementioned procedure, he was stabilized on the floor, given ASA and plavix, and treated with Meropenem per [**Hospital1 18**] ID recommendations.
On [**2167-6-16**], he returned to the angio suite with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], for LLE angio with Left SFA stent and posterior tibial angioplasty with balloon.
Because he has baseline anemia and lost about 150 mL of blood during surgery, he received one unit of blood and 1L of normal saline in the OR.
The patient continued to mentate well with no evidence of end-organ damage, but in the setting of proteus and e.coli in blood cxs, was transferred to MICU out of concern for sepsis.
He was not bolused because of his ESRD.
Given the patient's stable mental status and lack of evidence of end-organ damage, he was continued on mereopenm without further change in his antibiotics prior to transfer to the general wards.
# E Coli/Proteus in Blood Culture: he was continued on Meropenem and Vancomycin but grew nothing from his blood cultures at [**Hospital1 18**] with ID team following.
# CLL/SLL: Recent PET CT [**2-/2167**] which showed FDG avid uptake in hilar nodes but not intra-abdominally.
However, because hilar nodes were concerning on PET CT, he received bronchoscopy with hilar lymph biopsy [**2167-3-13**].
