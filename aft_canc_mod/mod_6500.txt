He had presented to [**Hospital3 **] with hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring CPAP.
He was treated with Vancomycin and Pip/Tazo epirically, however this was later discontinued after bronchoscopy as post-obstructive pneumonia was thought less likely.
He underwent bronchoscopy on [**2176-1-2**] which revealed the RLL mass obstructing the bronchus.
Biopsy was taken and revealed moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.
Pt currently denies subjective SOB at rest, but admits to significant dyspnea with minimal exertion.

Brief Hospital Course: 69 yo male with hx of severe COPD with hx of hospitalizations requiring intubations in the past, squamous cell lung cancer with hx of LLL lobectomy, presents in transfer from [**Hospital1 **] s/p episode of hypercarbic respiratory failure.
During that hospitalization, he was treated with CPAP and underwent bronchoscopy for concern of RLL collapse which revealed mass obstructing the bronchus, and was confirmed to have recurrence of squamous cell cancer.
# Severe COPD, CO2 retention Floor course unclear, however patient was initially admitted to the floor, where BIPAP was not started.
Overnight [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] staff was called to take the patient to the unit, secondary to elevated CO2 and evidence of CO2 narcosis.
On exam some evidence of CO2 toxicity persists.
As definitive treatment of this issue would be relief of dead space via XRT of his obstructing SCC, and because his oncological care is at the [**Hospital1 84145**] transfer to [**Hospital1 112**] for initiation of XRT was undertaken.
# Squamous cell cancer, with RLL mass/RLL collapse Bronchoscopically evaluated at [**Hospital1 **], found to have SCC obstructing bronchus intermedius.
# BPH with hx of retention - We continued his flomax .
# Hx of dCHF (EF 50-55%) - Per records, pt no longer on betablocker, diuretics, or other cardiac medications, he never displayed signs of volume overload.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after being transferred from [**Hospital3 4107**] for having difficulty breathing resulting in high carbon dioxide levels.
You also underwent a bronchoscopy which showed a RLL mass causing bronchus obstruction of the RML and RLL.
You were briefly admitted to the medicine floor but then transferred to the ICU after your oxygen level was noted to be low (70%) and your carbon dioxide level was high.
