Admission Date:  [**2186-8-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2186-8-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2127-2-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: scallop  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**] Chief Complaint: unresponsiveness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: (obtained from transfer medical records, OMR, and transfer s/o) Mrs. [**Known lastname 4048**] is a 59-year-old right-handed woman with history of HTN, HLD, COPD on home O2, CHF, cervical and endometrial adenocarcinoma, paraganglioma of the left skull base s/p radiation, seizure disorder due to paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis who is transferred from OSH intubated after episode of unresponsiveness for further of current presentation and skull base tumor.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 4048**] initially presented to OSH on [**2186-8-24**] after having a transient (seconds to minutes) loss of consciousness.
No activity concerning for seizure.
She was initially hypertensive but then required pressors for blood pressure support.
They could find no clear cause for the decompensation.
This paraganglioma has since enlarged extending further, invasive of the left skull base and petrous temporal bone.
Her last brain MRI was done [**2-/2186**] (report in Atrius) which noted that "there was a marked increase in size of the metastatic lesion in the left petrous apex bone.
There is extension of the mass into the posterior fossa, the foramen magnum, and into the infratemporal fossa on the left.
With respect to Mrs. [**Known lastname 4048**]' oncologic history, a paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis was the first presenting suggestion of an oncologic process.
She developed a complex partial seizure disorder greater than three years ago culminating in the diagnosis of a paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis with increased FLAIR signal in both medial and temporal lobes on MRI.
She received one course of IVIG, steroids and plasmapheresis which apparently halved the antibody titer.
The grade of the cervical carcinoma was T1N1M1,and the grade of the endometrial adenocarcinoma was grade I, T1b.
The seizure disorder is characterized by complex partial seizures which do not generalize.
The husband does not notice the seizures, but the daughter notices them, and these have been previously captured on EEG, per the patient.
Per the husband, the daughter notices a vacant look, and the patient seems spacey for a short time.
Early last summer, the patient began to experience difficulty swallowing.
She had difficulty swallowing boluses with gagging, choking, and demonstrated projectile vomiting.
Soon after this, she was noted to have a hoarse voice.
Workup included imaging of the skull base, which included an MRI in [**Month (only) 956**] this year as a follow up set of images.
The MRI read from [**Month (only) 956**] suggests "a metastatic lesion."
Thus, paraganglioma was considered the most likely diagnosis.
She saw an ear, nose and throat surgeon at [**Hospital 13128**] who suggested that intervention surgically would be dangerous and result in significant morbidity given the location of the tumor at the skull base adjacent to cranial nerves and great vessels.
Therefore, she underwent radiation treatment with the radiation to it including the left skull base and the lesion.
There has been no biopsy of this lesion to demonstrate its underlying nature.
She was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] in [**Hospital **] clinic to discuss surgical intervention or proton beam or Gamma Knife intervention.
She denied any difficulty swallowing recently with no choking or vomiting.
Of note, in clinic the patient mentions a left-sided ptosis that has appeared about two months ago.
No appreciated change in sweating on the left side of the face.
Past Medical History: PMHx: -Hypertension -Hyperlipidemia -hx of traumatic SDH that did not require surgical intervention -hx of T3 vertebral fx s/p fall -Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis in [**2183**] resulting in seizures  and some difficulty with memory.
-Seizure disorder (complex partial, do not generalize) -Cervical and uterine cancer 2.5 years ago s/p surgery and chemoradiation -COPD with chronic CO2 retention; with minimal tobacco history; baseline bicarb 36; able to walk about 40 to 50 feet, meaning that she can get to and from the kitchen and to his car without difficulty.
-The patient previously smoked in her teens and young adult group, but this was less than one pack a day and was only for several years.
-She drinks no alcohol and had previously only had rare alcohol.
Family History: -no lung disease, COPD, seizures, or known cancers.
No wheezes, rales, rhonchi Cardiac: RRR, no murmurs Abdomen: soft, nontender, nondistended Extremities: trace pedal edema, 1+ DPs Skin: no rashes or lesions.
Full EOMI to the right, unable to bury sclera on leftward gaze with 2-3 beats of fatigueable right beating nystagmus.
No adventitious movements.
The left skull base mass involves the anterior and posterior elements of C1 and C2.
Though paravertebral expansion is present, there is no significant spinal canal encroachment, and no spinal cord compression.
Abnormal high T2 signal in the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter of the spinal cord from the craniocervical junction through C3, with patchy associated contrast enhancement, most likely related to subacute infarction, given the presence of contiguous subacute infarction in the left lateral medulla and the left posterior inferior cerebellar hemisphere.
Recommend follow-up to exclude the less likely possibility of malignant involvement.
Chronic compression deformities of T1 through T3 vertebral bodies, without evidence of associated masses.
Mild retropulsion at T3 does not compress the spinal cord.
Cervical degenerative disease from C3-4 through C6-7 without spinal cord compression.
Large infarction with hemorrhagic transformation in the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery territory, involving the cerebellar hemisphere as well as the left lateral medulla.
Severe compression of the fourth ventricle.
No dilatation of the third and lateral ventricles at this time.
8 mm rim-enhancing leptomeningeal nodule in the left inferior parietal region, likely a metastasis.
No associated edema.
Large left skull base mass invading the clivus, petrous temporal bone, occipital bone, and the C1 vertebra.
The mass abuts the carotid canal and multiple skull base foramina.
Irregularity and narrowing of the distal cervical and proximal intracranial left vertebral artery at the level of the left skull base mass, where the artery is encased by the mass.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 4048**] is a 59-year-old right-handed woman with history of HTN, HLD, COPD on home O2, CHF, cervical and endometrial adenocarcinoma, paraganglioma of the left skull base s/p radiation, seizure disorder after episode of paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis who is transferred from OSH intubated after episode of unresponsiveness for evaluation of skull base tumor and recurrent episodes of unresponsiveness.
# Neuro: On admission exam, patient was alert, opened eyes to voice, following axial simple commands (closed eyes and opened eyes, stuck out tongue), with impaired left gaze>right and R gaze preference.
Per husband who is in the room, prior to hospitalization on [**8-24**], Mrs. [**Known lastname 4048**] was able to walk without assistance, feed herself and bathe with minimal assistance.
This was quite concerning for metastatic or compressive involvement of the cervical cord.
Her presentation of at least 3 transient losses of consciousness and then a more severe unresponsiveness with is concerning for possible seizure activity vs. autonomic dysfunction vs. cardiac cause.
Given the location of the skull base mass and the mass effect seen on the medulla and cerebellum, it is plausible that this mass could be causing a vagal effect.
We pursued further evaluation of this mass to look for potential treatment.
Patient with known skull base mass, seizure disorder,and several episodes of unresponsiveness.
On admission, initiated 24 hour urine metanephrines and catecholamines to eval for paraganglioma.
Also, continued home AEDs: Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] and lacosamide 250mg bidAlso, new onset quadriplegia from hospitalization on [**8-24**].
MRI head w/ subacute left posterior inferior cerebellar infarct extending into the lateral medulla with hemorrhagic conversion.
EEG with no seizure activity, but did have decreased amplitude since midnight.
Currently, on exam, patient has locked in syndrome--she is quadriplegic, only eye movements intact, but, has R III and VI palsy as well as L VI.
# Cardiac: labile BP, hx of CHF with unknown EF.
Did have b/l pleural effusions concerning for component of CHF exacerbation contributing to poor respiratory status.
This is also likely due to autonomic dysfunction.
Also has b/l pleural effusions further adding to her barriers to extubation initially.
