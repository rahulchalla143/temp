Admission Date:  [**2163-2-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2163-3-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2115-7-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3016**] Chief Complaint: worsening pain, weakness, and low grade fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 47 yo F with multiple sclerosis and metastatic melanoma p/w FTT at home.
Known metastatic disease to brain, spleen, spine.
Patient with chronic back pain secondary to metastatic disease.
The patient reports that it has been difficult to manage at home since around [**Holiday **] when she discovered the recurrence of the melanoma in her left axilla.
Over the past 1-2 weeks she has had persistent lower back pain and poor PO intake.
She reports low grade fevers to 99 at home with difficulty sleeping over the last few weeks.
Poor PO intake over last few weeks.
She was seen in the Pain [**Hospital 9085**] clinic and started on oxycontin and oxycodone for her back pain without much relief.
This morning her family felt that it was becoming too difficult to manage her symptoms at home and felt it was necessary to bring her to the ED.
A CT scan was performed and did not show any drainable abscess from her left axilla.
Past Medical History: # Metastatic Melamoma - [**2162-2-8**], underwent an excisional biopsy for what was felt to be a 7.2 thick, [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level IV, nonulcerated melanoma with 10 mitoses/m2 on her left shoulder.
There was evidence of lymphovascular invasion and a question of perineural invasion.
She underwent a wide local excision and left axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy on [**2162-3-12**] with pathology revealing melanoma in 4 sentinel lymph nodes with evidence of extracapsular extension.
She underwent a completion left axillary node dissection on [**2162-3-26**] with pathology showing no melanoma in 3 lymph nodes identified.
She was placed on interferon alpha-1a (Rebif) for multiple sclerosis on [**2162-7-6**].
She presented to Clinic on [**2163-1-26**] with multiple nodules in the left axilla consistent with recurrence within the radiation field.
Subsequent head MRI showed multiple CNS metastases.

**FINAL REPORT [**2163-3-2**]**     Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2163-3-2**]):    NO GROWTH.
No evidence of drainable fluid collection.
If concern exists for neurologic change or compromise, consider MRI imaging to help evaluate the soft tissue encroachment on the thecal sac and/or nerve roots.
Innumerable bony metastatic foci throughout the lumbar spine, the sacrum, and the visualized ilia.
Apparent epidural extension of tumor at the L3-4 level causing mild canal stenosis.
No definite signal abnormality within the distal spinal cord or nerve roots.
[**2163-2-23**] CXR IMPRESSION: No new pneumonia in the visualized portions of the lungs.
Multiple melanoma metastases as on prior.
Bony metastatic disease.
No evidence of cord compression.
Intrinsic signal abnormalities within the spinal cord secondary to multiple sclerosis with a possible enhancing multiple sclerosis plaque at T7-8 level.
No epidural mass seen.
[**2163-2-26**] RLE Ultrasound IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT within the right lower extremity.
Several new enhancing lesions, less than 1 cm, consistent with further progression of metastatic melanoma.
No evidence of edema, mass effect, or hemorrhage.

She was continued on Vanc and Cefepime for broad coverage given her left axillary wound and she remained hemodynamically stable.
She was continued on decadron for her spinal met and dilaudid for pain control.
OMED COURSE: 47 F w/ metastatic melanoma to lung, liver, brain, severe MS p/w weakness and FTT.
Monitored for narcosis or depressed respiratory rate.
# Confusion - Briefly noted early during inpatient course.
Initially thought to be most likely a side effect of medications, but patient has known brain metastases.
MRI brain showed small new mets c/w melanoma, also stable demyelinating disease.
# Hypertension - No history of this in the past, but pt persistently hypertensive on the floor (although BPs were taken in legs because L arm with invasive melanoma, R arm with PICC, so BP likely overestimated).
BPs's decreased as pain has come under better control but ultimately required continued metoprolol for BP control, discharged on this medication.
# Metastatic Melanoma w/ axillary wound - Plan to continue chemo with TMZ 200mg per m2 at later date, currently not able [**3-12**] compromised health.
Pan Spinal MRI showed intrinsic signal abnormalities within the spinal cord secondary to multiple sclerosis, as well as diffuse bony metastatic disease, with no evidence of cord compression seen.
Wound care was consulted for axillary wound and followed patient throughout stay.
# Intermittent Fever - Most likely related to malignancy.
Patient presented with fever in ED.
Unclear source for an infection, as CT showed no axillary abscess and all cultures either negative or with NGTD.
No further antibiotics were given and no further evidence of infection was found.
# Multiple Sclerosis - Last med was Rebif, d/c'ed in [**Month (only) **], with no relapses.
Spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10835**], would defer all MS rx at this time while undergoing chemo; a last ditch option would be MTX or cyclophosphamide.
If undergoing brain XRT may need more steroids as higher risk for MS relapse, but this is deferred to outpatient follow-up if patient becomes symptomatic from new brain metastases.
# Shoulder Pain - Complained of R shoulder pain that began the day prior to admission following upper extremity physical therapy.
Patient was consistent with muscle strain, which patient thought was true as well.
Abdominal exam benign with no signs of radiating origin.
# Anxiety - Psych consulted, continued prn BZD.
Duloxetine added for pain control.
# Code - DNR/DNI - discussed with patient at time of admission  Medications on Admission: Dexamthasone 4mg [**Hospital1 **] Ambien 10mg PRN Oxycontin 20mg [**Hospital1 **] Oxycodone 5mg prn Neurontin 300mg , uptitrating Xanax 0.5mg PRN Fiorinal 50-325-40mg cap 1 cap daily prn headache Ibuprofen 600mg q8h compazine 10mg tab q6h prn nausea  Discharge Medications: 1.
Methadone 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours): hold for oversedation or confusion.
Lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO BID (2 times a day): Hold for loose stools.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 2670**] - [**Location (un) 1456**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: weakness .
Secondary: # Metastatic Melanoma - mets to brain, pelvis, femurs, spleen, adrenals, and spine # Multiple Sclerosis - Diagnosed in [**2154**], relapsing/remitting   Discharge Condition: stable, pain under good control   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with worsening lower back pain, lower extremity weakness, and low grade fevers at home.
You were initially admitted to our ICU for close observation because we were worried about an possible infection in your bloodstream.
However, no source for an infection was ever found and you were then transferred to our oncology floor.
You had some intermittent fevers but again, no infection was found.
We did an MRI of your spine which showed diffuse bony metastases which were likely causing your pain and weakness.
Our pain service consulted and put you on an extensive pain control regimen which lowered your pain to an acceptable level.
At points you were confused, which was likely a side effect of the large amount of pain medicine you were on.
This scan showed a few new small lesions that were unlikely to be responsible for the confusion.
We continued to treat your cancer with a drug called temozolomide, as well as with the palliative chemotherapy.
If you experience any symptoms that disturb you, such as new weakness, fevers,chills, please call your doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 10836**] to the ER.
