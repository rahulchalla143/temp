Underlying infection in this region cannot be excluded.
Moderate left and small right pleural effusions.
Overdose: The patient overdosed with beta blocker and valium, complicated by cardiogenic shock.
She was on pressors for hypotension and was intubated for airway protection.
Psychiatric issues: Patient has been very anxious and depressed.
Psychiatry recommended Haldol prn and Quetiapine prn for agitation and anxiety.
She spiked fever, developed cough and new oxygen requirements.
CXR showed left retrocardiac opacity.
Levofloxacin and metronidazole were started empirically for presumed aspiration pneumonia on [**2109-11-16**].
Blood cultures had no growth.
Prior to discharge, she was satting >93% on room air and has been afebrile without leukocytosis for several day.
FENa calculated from urine electrolytes on [**2109-10-16**] was 24%, suggesting intrarenal process.
Patient's renal failure has resolved and Cr was 0.5 prior to discharge.
Elevated PTT: Unclear etiology for transiently elevated PTT x several days.
Likely due to contamination with heparin.
Afib, newly diagnosed: Patient has had several episodes of atrial fibrillation since resolution of bradycardia.
While the possibility that a fib was in the setting of cardiogenic shock/synmpathetic overdrive, it was felt that anticoagulation is warranted.
Iron studies were consistent with ACD but appears that these were drawn after blood transfusion and may not be reliable.
The cause of her anemia is not entirely clear.
The patient should follow up with gastroenterology regarding her biopsy results and should be seen in 4 weeks for possible SBFT/capsule enteroscopy.
Cardiogenic Shock secondary to #2.
Atrial Fibrillation, newly diagnosed.
Acute Renal Failure.
Please start anticoagulating the patient with warfarin with heparin bridging on [**2109-10-28**] (weeks after EGD and colonoscopy with biopsies/polypectomy) for atrial fibrillation.
Please fihish full 10 day course of antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia.
Where: [**Hospital6 29**] CARDIAC SERVICES Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 902**] Date/Time:[**2109-12-25**] 11:00  Please follow up with gastroenterology regarding biopsy results and possible small bowel FT or caplule enteroscopy.
Thyroid function tests should also be rechecked once the patient is over acute illness.
