She was found to have pre-renal acute renal failure and was admitted to the medical service for hydration.
A pelvic ultrasound and an abdominal CT revealed massive ascites and a 12-cm pelvic mass.
A pelvic MRI revealed a heterogeneous pelvic mass suspicious for a neoplasm, thought to be arising from the uterus, or less likely from the ovary or from the rectum.
There was a small-to-moderate amount of ascites with proteinaceous debris in the procedure cul-de-sac.
Her CEA level was 212 and her CA-125 level was only elevated to 71.
Ms. [**Known lastname 29257**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 1170**] on [**2199-9-13**], and discharged from the hospital after resoluation of her renal failure.

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2199-10-24**] 10:36 PM FINDINGS: No previous images.
The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size and there is mild tortuosity of the aorta.
Specifically, no evidence of pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or acute pneumonia.
There may be minimal bibasilar atelectatic change.
No evidence of hydronephrosis to explain low urine output.
Decompressed bladder with Foley catheter in place.
PORTABLE CHEST, [**2199-10-25**] FINDINGS: The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, but pulmonary vascularity is normal, and there is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
Minor areas of atelectasis are present, with linear opacities in the right infrahilar and left retrocardiac region.
Possible very small left pleural effusion.
No evidence of mediastinal or hilar adenopathy.
Subpleural 2-3 mm lung nodules.
Dependent atelectatic changes.
Moderate ascites.
*) Hyperkalemia: - Post operatively had elevated K up to 5.7, which was not treated and improved spontaneously.
Thought to be due to third spacing of fluid and intravascular hypovolemia.
Improved with fluid boluses.
This was further evaluated with a chest CT which revealed no lymphadenopathy, but did show 2-3 mm subpleural nodules.
*) C. Diff:  - Patient had one day of loose stools on POD#5, and her stool tested positive for C. Diff.
She had no fever or dehydration or electrolyte abnormalities.
