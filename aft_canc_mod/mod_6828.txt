Also with subjective fatigue, 30 lb unintentional weight loss, and n/v.
He does have a productive cough for white sputum, no hemoptysis.
Has back pain associated with this worsening SOB and has been having extensive workups as an outpatient.
He was thought to have DJD vs. OA as causes of his pain.
Recent MRI of upper back showed suspicious lesion and he was scheduled for biopsy in the next few weeks.
Due to his worsening SOB, his wife insisted that he come to the [**Name (NI) **] for evaluation.
He was tachypneic and tachycardic throughout ED course.
He received 1L NS, dilaudid for pain, and vanco, cefepime and levofloxacin for coverage of HAP or CAP.
He was tired and wanted to sleep but otherwise had no other complaints.

CT chest/abd/pelvis: CHEST: The aorta is normal in course and caliber without evidence of dissection or aneurysm.
The central pulmonary arterial tree opacifies normally and demonstrates no filling defect to suggest the presence of a pulmonary embolism.
There is bulky lymphadenopathy in the anterior, middle and posterior mediastinal compartments with the posterior nodes appearing the largest measuring 2.9 cm in short axis diameter (S400b:33).
Superior mediastinal nodes measure up to 1.9 cm in short axis diameter (S3:9).
Conglomerate left hilar lymphadenopathy results in encasement of the bronchovasculature with the large nodes individually approximating 2-cm in short axis diameter (S3:9).
Nodal encasement of the airway supplying the lingula and left lower lobe resulting in complete atelectasis of these portions of the left lung.
Additionally, there is nodal encasement of the left lower lobe draining pulmonary vein without evidence of thrombosis at this time, though given this appearance future thrombosis is a likely complication.
Note is also made of enlarged axillary lymph nodes measuring up to 2.6 cm in short axis on the right and 1.5 cm on the left.
An enlarged lymph node is noted just above the left hemidiaphragm on series 3, image 107 measuring 2.4 cm in short axis diameter.
There is a large left pleural effusion which layers posteriorly and surrounds the collapsed lingula and left lower lobe.
There is invasion into the left posterio chest wall by this malignant appearing pleural mass.
Infiltrative mass is seen extending intercostally into the chest wall with a thickness of 4.5 cm (S3:105).
In addition, there is a left paraspinal component of this pleural-based mass which may involve and/or extend into the left lower thoracic neural foramina (as described on recent MRI).
The right lung is essentially clear aside from chronic-appearing consolidation in the right lung apex, which may be related to chronic granulomatous disease.
In addition, there is some scarring/suture noted in the right middle lobe which may reflect the provided history of prior partial resection.
The heart is normal in size with only trace pericardial thickening versus effusion noted inferiorly.
Extensive calcification along the tracheobronchial tree is noted.
The airway is centrally patent though collapse of the lingula and left lower lobe appears secondary to airway compromise at the level of the left infrahilar region due to the bulky lymphadenopathy.
The pancreas, spleen and adrenal glands appear normal.
Kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast promptly without evidence of focal concerning renal lesion.
Lymphadenopathy is noted in the retrocrural space measuring up to 3.2 cm in short axis diameter.
Additionally, there is enlargement of the celiac axis node measuring up to 2.1 cm.
The abdominal aorta and major branch vessels appear patent with minimal calcification along the distal abdominal aorta.
No free air or free fluid is seen.
A node is seen inferior to the spleen on series 5, image 36 measuring 11 mm in short axis  PELVIS: Loops of small and large bowel demonstrate no evidence of ileus or obstruction.
Please note lack of enteric contrast does limit evaluation for bowel wall thickening and mesenteric masses.
Mesenteric lymph nodes appear grossly unremarkable.
There is a small nodule in the right iliac fossa on series 5, image 42.
No definite inguinal lymphadenopathy is seen.
The urinary bladder is mostly decompressed.
No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are seen along the iliac chain bilaterally.
BONE WINDOWS: While the left paraspinal and left posterior chest wall infiltrative mass is invested between the ribs and appears to enter several left lower thoracic neural foramina (better assessed on MRI), there is no bone invasion or evidence of osseous metastasis.
Spinal alignment appears normal with mild degenerative changes noted in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine.
Old right posterolateral rib fractures may be related to history of prior partial right lung resection.
No acute fractures are seen.
Diffuse body wall edema is noted.
Large left posterior pleural mass with invasion into the chest wall with associated large left pleural effusion.
Abdominal lymphadenopathy as well as bulky mediastinal, left hilar, axillary lymphadenopathy with compression and collapse of the left lower lobe and lingula.
Overall findings are concerning for malignancy with lymphoma being a strong consideration.
Please note, if drainage of the left effusion is attempted, efforts should be made to avoid traversing the pleural soft tissue abnormality.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic process.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 73 y/o M with DOE, worsening SOB and large mediastinal lymphnodes and pleural effusion concerning for malignancy.
#  Pleural Effusion:  possibly malignant effusion vs. emphyema.
Fluid consistent with exudate.
Pathology was equivocal but lymph node biopsy consistent with large B cell lymphoma.
Chest tube eventually pulled and patient continued to breath well without signs of effusion clinically.
#  Lymphoma - had L axillary lymph node biopsy confirming diagnosis.
Course was complicated by intense fatigue and constipation.
Patient also was very edematous and receiving lasix daily but was still edematous at the time of discharge.
#  Pain: likely from metastatic disease, will be exacerbated by pain caused after thoracentesis.
# Access - patient had severe swelling in R arm where PICC was placed, was pulled the day prior to discharge.
Did not have a clot based on UE ultrasound.
Medications on Admission: Lipitor 10 mg daily ASA 81 mg daily Glucosamine supplements variety of narcotics for "sciatica" pain   Discharge Medications: 1.
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO once a day: do not take if having loose stools.
Large B cell lymphoma 2.
Malignant pleural effusion   Discharge Condition: patient walking around with walker, afebrile, vital signs normal, still with 2+ pedal edema, 95% on room air   Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital to have evaluation of a mass seen on a scan done by your PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] admission you were found to have a large pleural effusion.
Then a biopsy of one of your lymph nodes was done and a diagnosis of large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was made.
The chemotherapy lasted 5 days and you tolerated it well except for some severe fatigue.
You also had a PICC line placed in your R arm and had some swelling in your R hand.
These were the pain pills you were getting while in the hospital.
Please call the hospital or be seen in the emergency room for any fevers with a temperature over 100.4, chills, falls, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting or any other concerns.
