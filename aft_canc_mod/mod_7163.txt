Admission Date:  [**2192-9-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2192-9-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2111-7-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ciprofloxacin Hcl  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**] Chief Complaint: multiple spinal metastases, concern for spinal cord compression  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: T8 vertebrectomy, T6-T10 fusion, T12 kyphoplasty  History of Present Illness: This is a 81 yo Portugese-speaking male with a history of prostate cancer, CHF, COPD, DM, new diagnosis of cirrhosis, who presented to OSH on [**2192-9-5**] with agitation and back pain and who was found to have tumor causing fracture in spine transfered her for NSURG evaluation.
The patient has been having back pain for approximately a month.
The day of admission he then fell out of a recliner chair and in severe pain and confused per his family.
A CT of the spine and a MRI were performed at OSH, which showed a pathologic fracture at T8 and a large tumor that has almost completley destroyed T8 vertebra with cord impingement.
On admission to OSH pt was extremely agitated and required 4 pt restraints, code grey called, and he injured right leg against railing.
The etiology of mass is also unknown -- so will need biopsy.
Patient was being treated with bactrim for UTI, but UCx grew enterococcus which was resistant to bactrim.
He currently denies any pain and feels well.
(+) Per HPI and for constipation and very small amount of dysuria.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.

There is no evidence of intraspinal mass seen.
At C3-4, there is disc bulging and mild narrowing of foramina.
At C4-5, disc bulging and moderate narrowing of both foramina seen with mild spinal stenosis and minimal extrinsic indentation on the thecal sac.
At C5-6, disc bulging and mild-to-moderate spinal stenosis and minimal extrinsic indentation on the spinal cord seen with mild-to-moderate bilateral foraminal narrowing.
At C6-7, disc bulging and mild spinal stenosis seen with indentation on the thecal sac and minimal indentation on the anterior aspect of the spinal cord with mild narrowing of foramina.
At C7-T1 to T3-4, mild degenerative change seen.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of bony metastasis in the cervical region or evidence of neoplastic cord compression.
Degenerative changes predominantly from C4-5 to C6-7 with mild extrinsic indentation on the spinal cord by disc bulging at C5-6 and C6-7.
LUMBAR SPINE: FINDINGS: The T12 vertebra demonstrates signal changes with low T1 and high inversion recovery signal involving the anterior half of the vertebral body and posterior inferior quadrant of the vertebral body with uninvolved posterior superior portion of vertebral body and pedicles.
There is mild compression of the vertebra seen without retropulsion.
In addition, there is a focal signal abnormality in the posterior inferior portion of L1 vertebral body with low T1 and mixed low and high T2 and inversion recovery signal.
The post-gadolinium axial and sagittal images are limited by motion, but no obvious large epidural extension from bony metastatic lesions identified.
There are no other foci of bony metastasis seen.
Degenerative changes with disc bulging noted from L1-2 to L5-S1 level.
No evidence of high-grade foraminal narrowing is seen.
The distal spinal cord and paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable on limited evaluation on motion limited axial images.
IMPRESSION: Infiltrative process involving the T12 and L1 vertebral bodies with mild pathologic compression of T12 vertebra.
No evidence of epidural mass identified or high-grade thecal sac compression seen.
Degenerative changes identified.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus.
Small left ventricular with hyperdynamic function.
A focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
CXR: [**9-15**] Continued left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
New or worse right effusion, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
This may all be due to pulmonary edema.
Pathology (spinal mass Bx - [**9-12**]): Results Still Pending **> Will Need Outpt Follow-Up<**  Brief Hospital Course: ID: This is a 81 yo male with a history of prostate cancer, CHF, COPD, DM, new diagnosis of cirrhosis, who presented to OSH with back pain and found to have tumor causing fracture in spine transferred her for NSURG evaluation.
Multiple lytic spinal metasrases from initially unknown primary: Transferred from OSH with multiple lytic lesions causing significant back discomfort, T8 and T12 compression fractures, and on CT scan, concerning for spinal metastases.
Primary tumor unknown and limited evaluation at OSH showed a low PSA and negative SPEP.
Postoperative pain managed with morphine bolus prn, transitioned to PRN PO morphine.
Agitation/AMS: Hospital course complicated by persistent agitation/ confusion dating back to initial admission at OSH.
Following surgical procedure, he became agitated while weaning off propofol gtt and was subsequently placed on precedex.
His mental status was thought to be secondary to toxic-metabolic encephalopathy from pain following the surgery, medication SE (on precedex gtt in setting hepatic insufficiency), hypoxemia from decompensated CHF/ anemia (see below), and communication difficulties (mainly portuguese- speaking patient).
Infectious evaluation with CXR, [**Hospital1 **] cultures, U/A and culture were negative; neurologic exam was nonfocal with OSH CT head showing no signs of metastases.
Precedex gtt was discontinued and morphine was judiciously administered for pain control.
Mental status improved over the next couple of days to the point where pt only had mild inattention at time of discharge.
Diastolic CHF: Upon admission, patient appeared euvolemic with ECHO showing hyperdynamic LV with an EF of 75%.
In the setting of aggressive volume and [**Hospital1 **] resuscitation during surgical procedure and post-operative care, patient became clinically hypervolemic.
At the time of admission to medical ICU, patient was in mild respiratory alkalosis with crackles at bases and evidence of vascular congestion on CXR.
Further diuresis initially held upon transfer to the medicine floor as pt had bump in Na, BUN, and Cr after ICU diuresis.
DM: Upon admission, patient had hyperglycemia likely due to high doses of decadron used.
UTI: Patient reported dysuria on admission to OSH which is almost gone now per patient.
Cx ultimately showed enterococcus [**Last Name (un) 36**] to ampicillin but resistant to bactrim.
CT scan of abdomen consistent with cirrhosis.
possibly euthyroid sick syndrome, vs subclinical hypothyroidism but pt had been started on low dose of synthroid at OSH and this was continued at [**Hospital1 18**] due to uncertainty around clinical situation.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospital for Continuing Medical Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: 1)Spinal/paraspinal masses - tissue diagnosis pending 2)Delirium  Secondary Diagnosis: 1)Transaminitis with liver cirrhosis 2)Balantitis 3)Urinary retention   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
At [**Hospital3 **] you were found to have multiple masses in and around the bones of your spine.
There was concern that your spine bones would become unstable because of these masses and a surgery was performed to stabilize your spine and to obtain a biopsy of the tissue to allow diagnosis of the mass.
Both before and after surgery you suffered from delirium which before surgery may have been triggered by ativan and after surgery by the effects of a large surgery.
