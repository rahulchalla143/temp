Once she arrived to the Emergency Room she denied headache, dizziness, numbness, or tingling.
A computerized axial tomography scan showed a large area of edema in her central right posterior fossae likely representing a neoplasm; most likely metastasis from her lung cancer.
She also had mild dilation of her third ventricle.
No hemorrhage.
She had increased lethargy.
She was admitted for further workup of this new brain tumor.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denied fever, upper respiratory infection symptoms, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, or bowel complaints.
Had not seen a doctor for 30 years until a recent lung cancer diagnosis.
Slightly somnolent.
No tenderness.
Chest revealed faint bilateral rhonchi.
The abdomen was soft and nontender.
RADIOLOGY:  Again, a head computer tomography showed a 1.5-cm x 2-cm mass in the left cerebellum with surrounding and compression of the fourth and fifth ventricles.
Had an enlarged third and lateral ventricle.
There was no intraoperative complications.
Not sedated and unresponsive to vocal stimuli; however, she responded to painful stimuli.
A head computer tomography done postoperatively showed postoperative changes, but no active bleed.
Due to her inability awake post surgery, she did have a ventriculostomy placed without any complications.
She had a magnetic resonance imaging of her head that showed postoperative changes.
They did not favor further systemic therapy prior to management of her CNS disease or prior to recovering from surgery.
On [**10-27**], she had a computerized axial tomography scan which showed postoperative changes with slight improvement of her hydrocephalus.
On [**10-29**], she underwent a magnetic resonance imaging which showed a reduction in mass effect as a consequence of the resection of the cluster right cerebellar metastatic lesions; however, other supratentorial metastatic lesions were noted.
She continued to be monitored in the Neurology stepdown unit for periods of agitation and to continue to assess her neurologic status.
She continued to have sutures in her head that will need to be removed on [**11-11**].
[**Name (NI) **] incision was healing well, and she had an increased appetite.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Cerebellar metastasis from non-small- cell lung carcinoma.
