Past Medical History: lung cancers as above, hypertension, GERD, COPD,   Social History: previous heavy EtOH (5+ beers/day, stopped 8 days ago, never diagnosed with liver disease), previous heavy smoker 60-80 pack-years in total, no illicits.

The left cerebellar lesion is causing significant mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
Lesions are consistent with metastases.
No evidence of transependymal signal change to suggest acute hydrocephalus.
There is expected pneumocephalus and post-surgical change, as well as a 1.5 x 2.6 cm post-operative hematoma in the resection bed.
Stable appearance of necrotic mass in the left temporoparietal region, with local mass effect upon the left lateral ventricle and no significant shift of midline structures.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST [**2116-7-19**]  The patient is status post left occipital tumor resection in the left cerebellar hemisphere, the expected surgical changes are visualized consistent with blood products and air in the surgical cavity, this lesion has been decreased in size since the prior study and the surgical bed is filling with blood products and CSF.
Supratentorially the cystic necrotic mass lesion is redemonstrated with internal nodularity and enhancement, relatively unchanged since the prior study.
No new metastatic lesions are visualized since the most recent examination.
A brain MRI obtained on [**7-17**] demonstrated enhaninc cystic lesion in the left cerbellar region and left temporal region consistent with metastasis.
A post-op CT demonstrated post-operative changes with hyperintensity in the surgical bed likely surgical material and mild hemorrhage.
MRI showed reduced size of lesion with blood in surgical bed, no new metastatic lesion were seen.
Disp:*60 Capsule(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Left cerebellar mass Left temporal mass   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**8-9**] days(from your date of surgery) for removal of your sutures and/or a wound check.
