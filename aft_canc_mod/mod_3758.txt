Admission Date:  [**2133-5-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-6-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2060-3-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Morphine / Ativan  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status.
History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 71459**] is a 73-year-old woman with an extensive medical history most notable for the diagnosis of CNS lymphoma in [**1-4**] was brought in to an OSH ED by the staff at her nursing home ([**Location (un) 51681**]) yesterday when she was found to have altered mental status at 1800; she is typically A&O x3 but was "pleasantly confused."
She was unable to carry on a conversaton, eat, or bear weight.
A head CT was done and reportedly showed mild midline shift.
CNS lymphoma diagnosed [**1-4**] when an OSH head CT showed a left frontal mass with significant associated edema; a subsequent brain biopsy here confirmed the diagnosis of CNS lymphoma.
PET scanning showed no evidence of FDG avidity elsewhere.
Cervical cancer s/p TAH-BSO and pelvic XRT that was complicated by radiation proctitis and right kidney failure ([**2130**]) for which she was treated with a cystectomy and nephrectomy with an ileostomy and ileal conduit.
3. chronic renal failure 4. renal tubular acidosis 5.
C. difficile colitis 6. deep venous thrombosis 7. gastroesophageal reflux disease 8. recurrent MRSA UTI 9. chronic anemia 10.
Osteoporosis with multiple compression fractures  Social History: Ms. [**Known lastname 71459**] is a widow and formerly lived in [**Hospital3 4634**].
GENERAL: frail, cachectic, elderly woman with temporal wasting SKIN: No rashes or lesions.
HEENT: No sinus tenderness.
Anicteric sclerae.
OP clear without lesions or thrush.
LYMPH NODES: No cervical or supraclavicular adenopathy.
PULMONARY: Poor effort, dense crackles more prominent on the left (over the lower [**12-30**] to [**1-31**] of the lung field) than on the right (over the lower [**12-31**] of the lung field).
No wheezes or rhonchi.
Ostomy bag with slightly cloudy urine.
GENITOURINARY: No CVA tenderness.

New left retrocardiac opacity is noted with indistinction of the left hemidiaphragm and possible small amount of left pleural effusion .
Increase in vasogenic edema in left but increasingly also involving the right frontal lobe.
Increased subfalcine herniation with midline shift to the right.
3)EEG ([**2133-5-25**]): This is an abnormal EEG in the waking and drowsy states due to the bursts of rhythmic slowing seen in the left frontotemporal region, without any obvious clinical correlate.
Very rare sharp waves were seen in the left parietal region towards the end of the recording, suggestive of an area of cortical hypersynchrony but no electrographic seizures were seen.
The bursts of generalized slowing suggest subcortical or deep midline dysfunction.
If clinical suspicion is high for subclinical seizures, continuous bedside telemetry may be helpful for further diagnosis.
4)MRI ([**2133-5-26**]): Increase in the number and extent of enhancing lesions involving multiple areas of the brain as described above as well as an increase in the surrounding white matter edema.
5)EEG ([**2133-5-27**]): Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the persistent and occasionally rhythmic sharp wave discharges in the left frontal region and due to the disorganized and slow background.
The first abnormality indicates an area of cortical hypersynchrony in the left frontal region.
Discharges were persistent and occasionally rhythmic although they did not constitute a definite clinical seizure at the time of the recording.
They suggest the possibility of seizures emanating from this site at other times.
The slow and disorganized background indicates a widespread encephalopathy.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
Decreased total number enhancing lesions within the brain parenchyma suggestive of chemotherapy steroid response.
New hyperintense T1 lesions displaying restricted diffusion predominantly within the prefrontal subcortical white matter.
Differential diagnosis includes new small hemorrhagic metastatic lesions or hemorrhagic small vessel infarcts from an etiology such as vasculitis.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 71459**] is a 73-year-old woman who recently received 4 cycles of rituximab and temozolomide for treatment of CNS lymphoma who p/w altered mental status possibly from seizure though toxic metabolic also could be contributing.
(1)Altered Mental Status: Patient initially presented with mental status changes.
CT head on admission showed increased mid-line shift.
Given the acute change and underlying brain mass, seizure was high on the differential although she had been on Keppra.
EEG on admission did not suggest seizure activity and was consistent with an encephalopathy.
Toxic/metabolic causes were also considered.
She had received a dose of Ceftriaxone at the OSH but given her history of Pseudomonal UTI she was started on Vancomycin and Ceftazidime.
On [**5-25**] patient acutely decompensated with decreased responsiveness.
At time of discharge she was placed on Ativan 0.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] to prevent seizure activity.
(2)CNS Lymphoma: CT scan at OSH reportedly not changed from [**3-4**] MRI but repeat imaging here showed an increased midline shift.
Repeat MRI showed response to chemotherapy.
No evidence of DVT at this time.
Given her acute decline in mental status, all oral feeds were stopped.
Opium Tincture 10 mg/mL Tincture Sig: 5-10 drops PO every [**4-3**] hours as needed for diarrhea.
Loperamide 2 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for diarrhea.
2)She will be discharged only on sublingual Ativan 0.5mg twice daily for seizure control.
