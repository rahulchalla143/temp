He received Unasyn for bacteremia which was changed to ceftriaxone [**7-11**] based on sensitivities.
He continued to do well clinically without fever and decreasing WBC (max 13.8 at [**Hospital1 18**]).
Given his advanced age and comorbidities, treatment options for adenocarcinoma are limited and we recommend hospice care -  the data compiled here are most consistent with cholangiocarcinoma, however, pancreatic adenocarcinoma is also a possibility.
As he has severe CKD and other co-morbidities, he is not a surgical candidate given this and his age.
