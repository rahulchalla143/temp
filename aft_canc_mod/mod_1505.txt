EGD [**2134-5-17**] Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and an endoscope was introduced through the mouth and advanced under direct visualization until the third part of the duodenum was reached.
There were no complications.
Findings: Esophagus:  Mucosa: Esophagitis with no bleeding was seen in the GE junctoin, compatible with mild esophagitis.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Erythema of the mucosa with no bleeding was noted in the antrum.
These findings are compatible with mild gastritis.
Impression: Esophagitis in the GE junctoin compatible with mild esophagitis Linear erosion on the greater curvature of the stomach consistent with NG tube trauma Erythema in the antrum compatible with mild gastritis Normal mucosa in the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: No clear explanation for the patient's GI bleed from this EGD.
Estimated blood loss = zero.
Bronchoscopy [**2134-5-26**]  Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
There were no complications.
Estimated blood loss = 25 ml.
Colonoscopy [**2134-5-31**] Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
The efficiency of a colonoscopy in detecting lesions was discussed with the patient and it was pointed out that a small percentage of polyps and other lesions can be missed with the test.
The patient was administered moderate sedation.
There were no complications.
Excavated Lesions A single circular ulcer was found in the rectum.
A single linear ulcer was found in the rectum.
Impression: Polyps in the ascending, descending, sigmoid Ulcer in the rectum Ulcer in the rectum Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations: Colonoscopy in 6 mos.
Estimated blood loss = zero.
No specimens were taken for pathology   Brief Hospital Course: 65yo M with a PMH of afib on coumadin, diabetes, HIV, HTN, and CHF admitted to the ICU with likely subacute GIB, with hct 12.8 in the context of supratherapeutic INR at 14.2.
Originally he was hypotensive secondary to significant blood loss.
He then receivied 6 units PRBCs and FFP with a massive transfusion protocol with SBPs in the 100s with a trauma line that was placed.
His atrial fibrillation normally treated with coumadin and diltiazem at home became Afib with RVR likely 2ndary to anemia (rates in the 120s to 140s).
Patient then became agitiated and went into flash pulmonary edema.
He improved afterwards and was able to breath off of the ventilator without hemodynamic compromise.
# Anemia [**12-24**] gastrointestinal bleeding: Patient reports a history of weeks of dark stools and was noted to have dark guaiac positive stool on rectal exam.
He does not carry a diagnosis of liver disease or known GI pathology, however he has also not seen a GI physician and has not had an EGD or colonoscopy previously.
His EGD showed esophagitis in the GE junctoin compatible with mild esophagitis, linear erosion on the greater curvature of the stomach consistent with NG tube trauma, erythema in the antrum compatible with mild gastritis.
He had a colonoscopy that showed several rectal ulcers and polyps in the ascending, descending, and sigmoid colon.
No clear explanation of the GI bleed was discovered and a colonscopy was recommened in 6 months.
# Supratherapeutic INR: patient is on coumadin for atrial fibrillation.
#CHF Pt required large doses of iv lasix and lasix drips to treat vol overload and lost over 19 kilograms during the hospitalization likely due to a fluid overloaded state and LE edema that resolved by the time of discharge.
#Hypertension: History of htn he was treated before with clonidine, Isosorbide Dinitrate, Lisinopril, Diltiazem ER, Metoprolol, and Minoxidil.
He was treated with clonidine, diltiazem, metoprolol mainly, but several medicines were used on a prn basis including hydralazine and a nitroglycerin drip.
# Elevated troponin: Likely due to demand ischemia [**12-24**] tachycardia and significant anemia.
# HIV: patient reports an undetectable viral load.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were treated in the hospital for low blood pressures likely from a gastrointestinal bleed in the setting of a high INR, which is a measure of the thinness of your blood on coumadin.
Because you stopped bleeding your coumadin was restarted on discharge.
Because you were critically ill, you were treated in the intensive care unit and were intubated for several days due to fluid in your lungs.
Since you had the breathing tube in for several days and it had been replaced several times, we changed your tube to a tracheostomy, which is the breathing tube that was placed in your neck.
