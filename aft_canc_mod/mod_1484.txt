[**2-3**] - CTA neg for PE, loculated R hydropneumothorax; also w/ large L sided-effusion w/ assoc atelectesis .
EKG's [**2-1**] - NSR at 88 bpm, 1 mm STD's and TWI's V4-V6, TWI's I & AVL  [**2-3**] - NSR at 84 bpm, resolved TWI's and STD's V4-V6; still w/ TWI's I & AVL (ols changes compared to [**5-/2136**])  [**2138-2-7**]:  IMPRESSION:  1)  AV fistulogram demonstrated complete thrombosis of the brachiocephalic vein fistula.
A significant stenosis was identified within the right brachiocephalic vein.
2)  Successful lysis of the thrombosed fistula using a total of 10 mg of t-PA. 3)  Venoplasty of the outflow cephalic vein stenoses using an 8-mm balloon and of the severe right brachiocephalic stenosis using a 12-mm balloon, all with good angiographic success and restoration of forward flow.
[**2138-2-10**]  Chest, Abd, Pelvis CT: 1)  No evidence of abscess, and no definite evidence of pneumonia.
There is airspace opacity along the tract of the prior chest tube which may represent contusion vs. consolidation.
2)  There are bilateral pleural effusions, loculated, which have increased in the interim since the prior exam.
The left effusion is large and the right effusion is moderate, and there is associated atelectasis.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Scattered areas of hypodensity within both thalami and the basal ganglia having an appearance consistent with chronic lacunar infarction.
No ultrasonographic evidence of cholecystitis.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions and associated bibasilar atelectases, essentially unchanged since the prior film of [**2138-2-11**].
No new lung lesions.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 year old man type II diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease s/p CABG, congestive heart failure (nml EF), CML, end stage renal disease s/p failed renal transplant on hemodialysis, transferred from outside hospital with hemothorax to Transplant surgery SICU team.
He developed respiratory failure requiring intubation on [**2138-2-3**], and transfer to the MICU.
Studies were not done on the initial specimen showing a spun Hct >50%.
He was ruled out for PE by negative CTA.
There was no history of trauma or previous history of COPD or bled formation.
Pleural effusions reaccumulated after removal of the chest tube.
A thoracentesis was done which showed an exudative effusion on the right, the side of the hemothorax, and a transudative effusion on the left.
Cytolgy showed no malignant cells.
By the time of discharge he had stable small bilateral pleural effusions by CXR and was saturating well on room air, not short of breath.
The effusions were attributed to CHF and chronic renal failure; the right appearing exudative as a complication of the high blood count.
The initial decompensation requiring intubation was thought to be due to mucus plugging.
There was no sign of pneumonia or abscess.
He was treated for a day with Zosyn and Vancomycin for concern of hospital acquired or aspiration pneumonia.
Sputum grew gram negative rods E. coli and Enterobacter.
As no findings were seen on CXR or chest CT, this was attributed to tracheobronchitis and treated with a 7day course of levofloxacin.
Delirium:  the patient developed a delirium complicated by agitation requiring a 1:1 sitter, Zyprex and Haldol, soft restraints.
The delirium resolved with treatment of his multiple medical issues.
A swallow study was done once the patient was more alert and initially showed risk of aspiration.
Hypotension:  in the ICU the patient became hypotensive and required a small dose of levophed.
Pancreatitis:  On [**2138-2-12**], after initiating a po diet, the patient developed nausea and epigastric pain.
LFTs showed mildly elevated transaminases, normal alk phos and total bilirubin, and moderately elevated lipase and amylase.
It was felt he developed a pancreatitis secondary to gallbladder sludging while on tubefeeds.
Nausea and abdominal pain resolved.
Cardiac:  He has known CAD s/p CABG and stent and CHF.
Echo was done and showed mild [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1915**], 1+MR, otherwise normal.
He ruled out for acute MI, and no further acute cardiac issues developed.
Type II diabetes mellitus:  he was monitored with QID fingersticks and treated with a regular insulin sliding scale.
He was continued on prednisone 5mg daily for his failed renal transplant.
Chronic myelogenous leukemia:  Diagnosed in [**2136**], the patient was previously on Gleevec.
This was held in the setting of his acute pulmonary issues.
They recommended holding the patient's Gleevec until he follows up with outpatient Oncology given his persistant state of fluid overload (he still had small pleural effusions), modestly elevated LFTs and recent course of pancreatitis.
He should bring all records regarding his history of CML and iron overload to that appointment.
Elevated CK:  On [**2138-2-10**] the patient was noted to have an elevated CK to 1300.
There was no CK-MB or Trop elevation to suggest a cardiac etiology.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % Solution Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) puff Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
