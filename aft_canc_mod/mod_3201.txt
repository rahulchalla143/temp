Admission Date:  [**2162-5-18**]     Discharge Date:  [**2162-5-27**]  Date of Birth:   [**2095-9-25**]     Sex:  M  Service:  NEUROLOGY  HISTORY:  This is a 65-year-old man with a past medical history of prostate cancer for the last seven years first diagnosed then and chronic urinary tract infection for the last eight months who presents with acute left sided weakness on the date of admission.
He then took two aspirin 325 mg because he was worried about having a heart attack.
He was brought to the Emergency Room at [**Hospital **] Hospital where a CT scan showed a right basal ganglia hemorrhage without mass effect.
He was noted by his wife not to be able to move his left arm or left leg at all.
His speech had also worsened in the last few hours and he states that he was unable to feel his left arm and left leg.
He had a mild headache, but had no other complaints regarding visual changes, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting.
He had no other associated complaints.
Prostate cancer x7 years with resection, history of normal    PSA.
Urinary tract infection x8 months.
No hypertension, checked with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] few weeks ago.
He is well-nourished in no acute distress.
No paraphasic errors.
No apraxia, and neglect was difficult to assess due to sensory loss.
No vesiculations.
His motor examination was normal bulk and tone, however, his tone was increased on the left upper extremity, no tremor on the right.
He had a left hemiplegia 0-1/5 in the upper extremity and 0/5 in the lower extremity.
He had a slight flicker at the shoulder.
He could not perform any of these tests on the left.
CT scan of the brain showed a 2.5 x 1.7 x 4 cuts intraparenchymal bleed involving the right thalamus, and capsule slightly increased in size compared to outside films with slight mass effect.
The location of his bleed was initially suspicious for a hypertensive hemorrhage.
However, on review of his records, he had not at that point, nor had ever been hypertensive, which raises the suspicion of a possible underlying lesion such as a metastatic lesion that bled or an aneurysm, most likely AVM.
Prostate cancer is a low likelihood of going to brain as well as bleeding, however, as a heavy smoker, metastatic lung cancer in the differential much also be ruled out.
We admitted him to the Neuromedicine service in the Intensive Care Unit for close blood pressure monitoring with a goal of less than 160 and close neurologic examination with plans to repeat the CT scan if any change in neurological examination.
He was seen by Neurosurgery, who felt that he was stable, and requested MRI when the patient was stable to rule out aneurysm.
He continued to have a dense left hemiplegia and also with slight several silver-wiring on funduscopic examination, however, no other major findings.
There is no end organ evidence for hypertensive disease.
We were concerned about a past history of thyroid nodule and history of smoking to investigate for underlying cancer.
Throughout his admission he continued to have a left facial droop and left hemiplegia, and did not gain any strength.
He was seen by Heme Onc on the first for the history of thyroid cancer, and we reviewed his past thyroid aspirate which showed atypical cells, however, it was not sufficient for full diagnosis.
Patient was seen by Heme Onc and after noting the left shift with hypersegmented polys and large platelets, I felt that he may have a myeloproliferative disease that can be associated with platelet disorders.
If the patient was actively bleeding with this disorder, one might given exogenous platelets given the platelet count was normal, however, he did not continue to bleed.
Although spontaneous bleeds are rare in myeloproliferative disorders, we needed to rule this out, and he was bruising and did have an intracranial bleed.
He was afebrile and doing well.
He was re-evaluated by Speech and Swallow, who felt that he was at low risk for aspiration.
Speech saw them again on the 5th and showed that he was a silent aspirator on the video swallow study meaning that he does not demonstrate any signs or symptoms of aspiration or difficulty in drinking thin liquids, but actually was aspirating.
We were concerned that the relationship between the right thyroid nodule and basal ganglial bleed as thyroid cancer is known to met to the brain and known to also bleed.
They did feel that his nodule appeared to have shrunken overtime and the initial cytology was relatively benign.
There was a low likelihood of malignancy, however, we can agree with the plan to check a fine needle.
Right basal ganglia bleed with resultant in left hemiplegia.
Chronic urinary tract infection.
We discussed with the family that some point in the future he may need a repeat bone marrow biopsy to be considered for evaluation for myeloproliferative disorder, but at this time he can be followed closely by hematologist.
He will also need a repeat urinalysis if his symptoms worsen and a urine culture that was sent on [**5-26**] will need to be re-evaluated for growth, however, it was pending on discharge.
