Admission Date:  [**2126-5-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2126-5-21**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Lisinopril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 19836**] Chief Complaint: DOE, lightheadedness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Colonoscopy Capsule study   History of Present Illness: This is a 83 year-old female with a h/o ischemic colitis, MGUS, HTN, AS who presents with SOB, lightheaded, found to have Hct of 19 down from 26.
She developed a transfusion reaction vs flash pulmonary edema in the ED and was admitted to MICU for further monitoring.
Pt recently had an episode of nonbloody vomiting, felt also more tired, lightheaded and had DOE.
She is being closely followed by her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] found to have worsened anemia with Hct from baseline of 30s down to 24 on [**2126-5-6**].
EGD was unremarkable but pt had a granulomatous mass on colonoscopy in [**9-/2125**] which was initially suspicious for plasma cell neoplasm and led eventually to the diagnosis of MGUS (per last Heme/Onc note from [**2126-3-27**]).
Of note, she has known ischemic colitis with LGIB in [**2121**] and [**7-/2125**], treated conservatively.
She was guaiac positive but takes iron.
CXR with no acute process.
However, after 60cc of blood, she developed facial redness, diaphoresis, was cool and pale, and was sob with diffuse crackles on exam.
Repeat CXR showed fluid overload.
Transfusion medicine feels that she did not have a blood reaction, but likely flash pulmonary edema.
ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, nightsweats, abdominal pain, chest pain, or lower extremity edema.
Moderate aortic stenosis.
Ischemic colitis with LGIB in [**2121**] and [**7-/2125**], treated conservatively.
-1.2L  GEN: WDWN elderly female in no acute distress HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, MMM, OP Clear NECK: No JVD COR: RRR, 3/6 SEM at USB radiating to both carotids, no G/R, normal S1 S2.
pulsus parvus/tardus PULM: Lungs CTAB, no W/R/R ABD: Soft, NT, ND, +BS, no HSM, no masses EXT: No C/C/E, 2+ DP pulses NEURO: alert, oriented.
No ecchymoses.
Brief Hospital Course: Anemia: Black, guaiac positive stools suggestive of UGI source.
Hypoxia: Was thought to be secondary to TRALI versus pulmonary edema from acute blood-transfusion-related volume overload.
In the end a diagnosis of TRALI was preferred given the right timing of onset, hypotension and facial flushing.
Hypoxia completely resolved since being on the floor.
At baseline she is asymptomatic with AS, though this may have contributed to her SOB/hypoxia here as noted above.
