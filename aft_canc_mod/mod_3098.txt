Mass effect on the chiasm and pre- chiasmatic optic nerves is stable.
No obvious vascular invasion is identified.
No other abnormal enhancing lesions are noted within the brain parenchyma.
IMPRESSION: Slight interval growth from [**2184**] of large planum sphenoidale meningioma with stable adjacent mass effect.
There has been interval removal of a suprasellar mass as seen on most recent prior MRI.
There is a 1.0 x 1.6 cm focus of high attenuation located in the right frontal lobe (2A:7) that likely represents focal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, not significantly changed when compared to prior exam.
High-attenuation material tracking along the right frontal lobe convexity is unchanged.
There has been interval decrease in extensive pneumocephalus.
There is no evidence of acute infarction or change in ventricular size and configuration.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus.
No new hemorrhage is identified.
No significant change in right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and right frontal hyperdensity seen layering along the dura.
Interval decrease in expected pneumocephalus  MRI Head [**7-30**]: FINDINGS: Since the previous study, the patient has undergone resection of tuberculum sella and subfrontal meningioma.
There is a right frontal craniotomy seen with a subdural collection in this region as seen on the recent CT. Small amount of blood products are seen in the inferior frontal region on the right secondary to the surgery.
There is no hydrocephalus or midline shift is seen.
No acute infarct seen on diffusion images.
Following gadolinium administration, no residual nodular area of enhancement seen in the region of tuberculum sella or the inferior frontal region.
The suprasellar lesion seen on the previous study has been resected.
Slight hyperintensity of the right intraorbital or intracranial optic nerve is also seen on diffusion images.
It is unclear whether this is secondary to edema or ischemia in the optic nerve.
IMPRESSION: Postoperative changes with resection of the subfrontal tumor without residual enhancing mass lesion identified.
Slight increased signal of the right optic nerve is seen on the T2 and diffusion images.
This could be secondary to edema from mass effect.
No acute territorial infarct seen.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 51216**] was admitted for an elective craniotomy for resection of a supersellar meningeoma on [**2185-7-29**].
She was monitored with close neurological observation she was found to have decreased vision in the right eye with possible light recognition.
MRI showed postoperative changes with resection of the subfrontal tumor without residual enhancing mass lesion identified.
Slight increased signal of the right optic nerve is seen on the T2 and diffusion images, no infarct was seen.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.

?Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
?Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
?Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
?You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
?New onset of tremors or seizures.
?Any confusion or change in mental status.
?Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
?Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
?Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**7-29**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and a wound check.
