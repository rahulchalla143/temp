He reported a cough productive of thick yellow sputum.
He also reported ongoing [**10-16**] frontal headache that has occured over the past week after initiation of radiation therapy to brain.
Per neurosurgery note, patient had nausea, vomiting, diarrhea at home.
Head CT was reportedly unchanged, though bilateral ventriculomegaly and cerebellar vasogenic edema was noted.
He later became tachycardic to 200s.
He became hypoxic requiring a NRB.
He became hypotensive to 72/41 so was started on a neo drip.

Engineer, occasional vodka use, no IVDU.
-Sibling w/DM  Physical Exam: VS: HR 74, BP 104/50, o2 sat 99%, Gen: sedated, intubated HEENT: PERRL, right sided sutures CV: RRR, no m/r/g Pulm: course bs bilaterally Abd: soft, NT, ND, bowel sounds present Ext: no peripheral edema Neuro: sedated, intubated   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 75361**] is an 81 year old male with recently diagnosed SCLC with brain mets s/p XRT and ventriculostomy placment, admitted with migrated endobronchial stent with LLL collapse s/p stent removal, episode x 2 of a. fib with RVR s/p cardioversion in ED, and headaches, admitted to MICU for respiratory failure and unstable hemodynamics with atrial fibrillation, transferred to floor once stable.
[**Name (NI) **] PNA - pt was initially started on vancomycin for post-obstructive PNA, showed downward trend in febrile temperatures and leukoctyosis.
Patient had OR procedure with interventional pulmonology for removal of bronchial stent removal and tolerated procedure well.
Patient was extubated without event or complication and was weaned from oxygen requirement.
Atrial fibrillation - pt had initial episode of atrial fibrillation in ED, requiring cardioversion back to sinus rhythm, then had second episode of atrial fibrillation with RVR to 190s on [**2161-10-18**] after returning from OR for stent removal, thought maybe precipitated by stent removal with cardia compression.
The pressor requirement was transient and patient was then continued on amiodorone and load with digoxin (dig loaded [**11-19**]).
An echocardiogram showed no  pericardial effusion with improved EF from prior and regional wall abnormalities.
Hypertension - patient has been hypotensive while in ICU in setting of afib and his anti-hypertensive medications were held.
Brain Mets/Headache - patient presented with severe frontal daily headaches associated with nausea and vomiting, thought likely related to increased ICP, also noted to have bilateral ventriculomegaly.
He was s/p endobronchial stent placement for palliation on his last admission, but as per above the stent migrated and had to be removed this admission.
# NSTEMI, CAD: Pt has a history of MI, EF 45% with RWMA, had troponin up to 2 in setting of cardioversion, though no EKG changes noted and rose again after prolonged tachycardia in setting of a. fib.
NSTEMI felt to be due to demand ischemia in setting of Afib with RVR, PNA and hypotension.
# Chronic systolic CHF:  EF 45-50% on TTE this admission with septal/apical hypokinesis.
His metoprolol was initially held due to hypotension, but was restarted once BP tolerated.
#  Chronic kidney failure, stage II:  creatinine remained at baseline.
