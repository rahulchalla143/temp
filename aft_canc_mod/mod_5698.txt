Admission Date:  [**2118-4-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-4-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2038-7-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Interferon Alfa  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath, chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization central line placement Swan-Ganz line placement  History of Present Illness: 79 year old F, hx renal cell CA s/p R nephrectomy and s/p chemo for recurrence, adrenal insuffiency, anemia with intermittent outpt transfusions.
Pt was admitted to OSH, c/o four days of SOB and chest pain, palpitations, increased when lying down.
Pt had CXR c/w pulmonary edema, BNP 83K, treated with diuresis BIPAP with some improvement.
This morning developed chest pain at 10AM, EKG with T wave inversions, echo performed with LVEF 25%, 3+ MR and 3+ TR (nl last year), found to have elevation in troponin to 0.09.
Subsequently pt developed AFib with RVR in the 200s, resistant to small doses of lopressor.
Arrived to [**Hospital1 18**], found to have AFib with RVR at 150 bpm, started on amiodarone, cardioverted to NSR, had cardiac catheterization showing LCx with large ramus 80% lesion, tx with BMS x2.
Aorta: 101/72/84 RV: 42/9/15 PA: 42/27/34 PCwp: 22 CO: 2.88 (CI 1.88) Upon transfer to CCU patient denies any chest pain, palpitations or shortness of breath.
She attributes the beginning of her breathing problems to the weight gain she experienced after starting on hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency leading to 15 lb weight gain.
Renal cell CA s/p right nephrectomy [**2104**] 2.
HTN 4.
Depression 5.
Hyperlipidemia 6.
Anemia [**2-10**] IFN: baseline HCT 25 over past 2 months, transfusion dependent 7.
Adrenal insufficiency, dx 1 month ago after presenting with weight loss.
Pertinent Results: Echo ([**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]) [**4-4**]: LF fxn severely depressed, hypokinesis of distal anteroseptum and inferoseptum, apex akinetic.
Asymmetric pulmonary edema, right greater than left.
Left basilar consolidation in the left retrocardiac region which may represent some atelectasis or edema.
Residual contrast persisting in the left renal collecting system and left renal parenchyma - question time of contrast administration.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed 2 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had mild luminal irregularities and gave rise to a moderate sized D1 which had a 60% stenosis.
The RCA was a dominant vessel with mild luminal irregularities.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided filling pressures with PCWP of 22mmHg with depressed cardiac index and low systemic blood pressure.
4  The proximal lesion in the ramus intermedius was predilated with a 2.5 X 15mm Voyager balloon, stented with overlapping 2.5 X 12mm and 2.5 X 08mm Minivision (Bare metal) stents with lesion reduction from 80% to 0%.
the final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no dissection and no embolisation.
On arrival to teh cath lab pateint with in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricularresponse.
Elevated left sided filling pressures, reduced cardiac index.
Rapid atrial fibrillation.
Successful stenting of the ramus intermedius lesion with bare metal stents .
CXR [**4-5**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-4**]: Pulmonary edema is markedly asymmetric, severe in the right lung, though improved since [**4-4**], and mild on the left.
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly with suggestion of left atrial enlargement is unchanged.
Small bilateral pleural effusions stable.
No pneumothorax.
No pneumothorax.
Echo [**4-5**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferior wall, mid inferolateral wall, distal half of the septum and apex .
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
CXR [**4-13**]: IMPRESSION: Resolving asymmetrical combined alveolar and interstitial process, likely due to resolving asymmetric edema.
Underlying infection in the right lung is not excluded in the appropriate setting.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed with inferior hypokinesis.
The mid to distal septum has borderline systolic thickening.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-10**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
F hx renal CA s/p nephrectomy, chemo presented with 1 wk of CHF sx's, found to have new cardiomyopathy, combination of ischemic and non-ischemic.
# Cardiac - Cardiomyopathy/systolic CHF - at presentation to outside hospital, pt was reportedly found to have both mitral and tricuspid severe regurgitation, , severely depressed LVEF and anteroseptal and inferoseptal hypokinesis.
However, this was not thought to be sufficient to explain her extensive echocardiographic changes.
Work-up for other non-ischemic causes of her cardiomyopathy reveal a normal TSH, iron labs showed Fe 326, TIBC 113, and although she had required some transfusions as outpatient since chemotherapy, this was not thought to be sufficient to cause iron overload or hemochormatosis type CM.
Given that the patient presented with AFib and tachycardia, tachycardia induced CM was thought to be the most likely secondary explanation.
The patient was treated with agressive diuresis using Swan-Ganz line for hemodynamic monitoring.
Her symptoms improved significantly.
Her ACE-I was held in light of increased Cr to 1.4, although improving at time of discharge.
# CAD - ramus lesion stented, started on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need plavix for 1 month.
# Rhythm - initially found to have AFib in the setting of decompensated CHF, started on metoprolol which was insufficient to rate control, and amiodarone was added.
She was loaded for one week with 200mg three times daily dosing, this was decreased to 200mg daily on day of discharge because of persistent nausea and poor po intake.
She did experience an episode of significant R sided anterior nasal bleeding while on heparin, however her PTT at this time was 41.8 and INR was 1.9.
The nose bleeding was controlled with pressure, Afrin, and silver nitrate localized cauderization.
This was thought to be most likely related to irritation from oxygen and the nasal cannula, however she may need to have a goal INR slightly lower of 1.8-2.5.
No further nose bleeds noted over next few days.
# UTI - she was complaining of dysuria, U/A was sent and found to have >200 WBC, + bacteria, started on bactrim on [**4-14**], her Cr jumped slightly and Bactrim was switched to cipro starting on [**4-18**] for a 5 day course.
# Renal carcinoma - in the past pt has been on experimental chemotherapy, however was intolerant to side effects.
Given malignancy, the thought of pulmonary embolus to exlain her shortness of breath was entertained, however given her improvement with diuresis thought less likely.
On previous CT images, she is noted to have a possible IVC thrombus, cardiac echo did not demonstrate extensive progression of this.
She has chronic anemia related to past chemo, epo has been tried in past and ineffective, needs occassional outpt transfusions.
# Depression - continued celexa, pt had poor nutrition and flat affect, although this seemed to improve at the time of discharge.
Psychiatry was consulted to recommend something for mood and possibly for appetite.
Recommended continuing Lexapro.
# Ppx - bowel meds, on coumadin .
