Anemia: Likely from a slow ooze, considering she has not noticed a change in her bowel movements, and is relatively well compensated for a Hct of 18.
The morning after admission had a small, tarry stool.
Upper endoscopy showed a large, ulcerated, bleeding mass in the antrum highly suspicious for gastric carcinoma.
A repeat endoscopy was performed after stabilization of her hematocrit, and pathology showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
The patient was set up with oncology follow-up for possible neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and partial gastrectomy.
SOB and dyspepsia with exertion: almost definitely related to severe anemia, however story also suspicious for ACS.
EKG shows possible mild strain, but not ACS.
Troponins were negative, and mild ST depressions resolved.
# CAD: continued rosuvastatin.
2. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
