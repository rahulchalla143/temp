IMAGES: [**2101-9-13**]   Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)     [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] R. In comparison with the study of [**9-12**], there is less prominence of the cardiac silhouette and no evidence of vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute pneumonia.

Findings are not specific for any particular type of infection .
There is an area of increased opacification at the right base medially.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion .
No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease .
No acute intracranial process.
Specifically, no intracranial hemorrhage.
Mild bimaxillary sinus mucosal thickening.
Scattered left mastoid air cell opacification, stable .
Findings suggest acute appendicitis with new peri-appendiceal fat-stranding about a dilated appendix.
No CT evidence of colitis.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2101-5-10**] no diagnostic interval change.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS # Febrile Neutropenia: His symptoms prior to admission were abdominal pain and diarrhea.
He denied symptoms of respiratory illness, however, his CT chest was suggestive of a bilateral ground glass pneumonia.
CT abdomen was also suggestive of acute appendicitis and he had melanotic diarrhea for a few days prior to admission.
Patient was empirically started on vancomycin (did not have a port), cefepime (neutropenic fever regimen), levofloxacin (atypical bilateral pneumonia coverage), and flagyl (intra-abdominal infection coverage).
He was discharged to complete a 14 day course of levofloxacin/flagyl for neutropenic fever and appendicitis.
# Sepsis: Upon admission, he met criteria for sepsis, but responded to volume resusitation with resolution of his hypotension.
TTE ruled out cardiac vegetations.
He persisted with tachycardia after his blood pressure was normal.
This was consistent with a pre-renal picture in context of hypotension/sepsis.
Suspectd to be due to nutrition.
PTT is normal and had low suspicion for other process like DIC.
# Pancytopenia: Likely due to chemotherapy with contributing factor of sepsis and possible GI blood loss.
# Syncope: Fell and hit his head quite hard at home.
CT head negative for intracranial hemorrhage.
Syncope likely due to hypovolemia given history of diarrhea and malaise with poor PO intake, elevated creatinine and fevers he undoubtedly had increased insensible losses.
TTE showed no evidence of structural disease leading to sycope and patient was monitored on telemetry without arrthymia events.
# AML: Monocytic differentiation, s/p 7+3 induction and finished consolidation with HiDAC, Cycle 4.
Antibiotics were administered as above, and fluconazole ppx was continued until he was no longer neutropenic.
Hyperglycemia during this admission was likely related to sepsis and resolved prior to [**Date Range **].
His A1c was normal, however, he had elevated FBS and may need therapy in the future.
He is already working on diet and exercise for weight loss  Medications on Admission: ciprofloxacin 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] fluconazole 200 mg daily ondansetron 8 mg q8h prn nausea  [**Hospital1 **] Medications: 1. levofloxacin 750 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily): Take for 7 days.
3. alum-mag hydroxide-simeth 200-200-20 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for dyspepsia, heartburn.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   [**Hospital1 **] Disposition: Home  [**Hospital1 **] Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Neutropenic fever .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: Acute myelocytic leukemia Normocytic anemia   [**Hospital1 **] Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital because you were having fevers and had very low white blood cell counts--called neutropenic fever.
This is a concerning condition because your body's defenses against infection are low due to chemotherapy.
You were found to have inflammation in your appendix suggestive of an infection and also possible pneumonia.
You also had low red blood cell counts in the hospital--called anemia.
This is common with chemotherapy, however, you may have had some bleeding in your GI tract which made this worse.
Bleeding in your GI tract causes black tarry stools and can result in a fast heart rate and low blood pressure like you experienced.
- You can use acetaminophen for pain control   - You can use Maalox as needed for abdominal bloating/heartburn .
