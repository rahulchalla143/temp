Admission Date:  [**2164-6-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-6-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2105-2-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**] Chief Complaint: persistant confusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Quinton catheter placement  History of Present Illness: This is a 59 y/o Haitian male with a PMHx sig only for recently diagnosed DMII who presented to an OSH on [**6-10**] with 3 day hx of worsening MS/confusion with visual hallucinations.
He also c/o neck stiffness.
Smear (-) for schistocytes.
HEME: Pancytopenia on admission.
GI: Initial labs AST 137, ALT42, Lipase 116, amylase 151; CT abd with mild pancreatic inflammation.
EXT: 2+ edema bilat.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
No evidence of tuberculosis or another infection.
13 mm subcarinal lymph node, possibly reactive.
Small amount of free fluid in the left upper abdomen.
Head CT [**6-21**] IMPRESSION: Large posterior fossa infarct with associated hemorrhage and mass effect with obstructive hydrocephalus.
EEG [**6-21**] IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the prolonged and prominent delta slowing on the right and the low voltage minimally slow background on the left.
This suggests a major structural abnormality on the right.
The left side appears better formed, but the widespread low voltage can also signify a cortical dysfunction on that side.
There were some sharp features (on the right), but there were no overtly epileptiform abnormalities.
Brief Hospital Course: /P: 59 y/o Haitian male with a PMHx sig only for recently diagnosed DMII who presented to an OSH on [**6-10**] with 3 day hx of worsening MS/confusion, fevers, found to have encephalitis, ARF, resp distress s/p intubation, pancytopenia, and acalculous cholecystitis.
Resp Failure Pt intubated at OSH for resp distress on [**6-11**], unclear exact etiology (hypercarbic vs hypoxic).
Pt's mental status never recovered and patient was continued on the ventilator on AC until he was discovered to have a massive ICH as below with cessation of independant respiratory function.
Pancytopenia Pt with a profound pancytopenia with an extensive w/u at the OSH that included malaria smear, (-) PPD, (-) HIV, SPEP/UPEP (-), histoplasma (-), Equine IgG/IgM (-), Rickettsial Ab (-).
Repeat smears at OSH(-) for TTP/hemangiopathic anemia.
Dif here with evidence of de-marginalization and dysmorphic BM including 17% bandemia, with nRBC seen on dif.
Heme was consulted who felt this was likely primary marrow failure vs TTP and recommended plasmapheresis.
Immediately after his catheter placement, pt was discovered to have neurologic deterioration and was found to have an ICH with herniation into his brain stem.
His BM from the OSH was sent over and reviewed by our pathologists and heme specialists who found a high incidence of marrow fibrosis that may be consistant with diffuse metastatic disease.
ARF Pt with ARF on admission to OSH, that initially improved with hydration and then began to increase with diuresis as needed to improve volume overload state.
DDx ATN vs pre-renal azotemia with ATN more likely diagnosis.
Renal was consulted who recommended HD but prior to initiation, pt had massive ICH as above and expired.
ID Pt with a pseudomonas bacteremia at OSH presumed due to line sepsis.
Due to his neutropenia and fever on arrival, pt was placed on Meropenem and Vancomycin for neutropenic fever coverage.
5. delta MS Pt with an initial MS change and confusion that brought pt to OSH 10 days ago.
On [**6-21**], after returning from IR for HD catheter placement, pt was found obtunded and unresponsive with fixed pupils.
An emergent CT scan showed a massive ICH with herniation posteriorly.
Neurology was consulted which revealed that there was no independant activity; although prior to the official declaration of brain death, pt developed cardiac arrest and due to his poor prognosis and discussion with the family, no resuscitation was undertaken.
