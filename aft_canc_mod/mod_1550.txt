Admission Date:  [**2104-7-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2104-8-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2035-6-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Ativan / Ambien  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4760**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory distress  MICU admit for:Respiratory failure   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation Femoral line placement OGT placement Radiation to sarcoma  History of Present Illness: 69 yo male w/ PMHx of obesity, tobacco abuse, osteoarthritis and chronic low back pain presenting from rehab with abd pain, SOB and hypoxia.
After c/o persistent and worsening low back pain pt found to have new soft tissue mass around L2 on imaging this summer, he [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] resection with hardware removal and tumor debulking [**7-3**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1352**] with subsequent nerve sheath and retroperitoneal resection with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1924**] on [**7-14**].
Pathology from surgery is consistent with sarcoma and high grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.
His pain from his incision was well controlled but pt became more and more constipated in setting of narcotics use resulting in escalating use of narcotics to treat pain.
He had no respiratory complaints and no oxygen requirements until [**Known lastname **] of admission.
He was complaining of abdominal pain and SOB in am, was found to be cyanotic with 02 sats in low 80s on room air.
He was initially treated with high dose IV steroids for a concern for wheezing with a history of reactive airways disease.
Pt hypotensive after intubation, initially given levo for BP 56/42, but developed AF and a question of VT vs AF with aberrancy.
His INR was noted to be very elevated at 18.
PE, PNA and bowel perforation prior to transfer to the MICU.
Denied abd pain, endorsed pain at his incision site at right flank, requesting assistance with repositioning.
Nodded that he had been having BM/flatus for past several [**Known lastname **] but had felt constipated.
sclera anicteric.
Hypoactive bs present.
No rebound or guarding.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
No splinter hemorrhages, osler nodes or [**Last Name (un) **] lesions noted.
sensation intact LE, b/l LE weakness R>L with 1/5 on right and [**1-15**] on left.
Less than optimal exam secondary to body habitus and limited field of view.
Compared to prior exam there is increased size of large right paraspinal mass and associated destruction of the adjacent vertebral bodies and posterior elements.
Paraspinal soft tissue mass contains gas.
Interval development of multiple foci of air in the large right paraspinal mass, with interal enlargement of the mas and increase in surrounding fat stranding.
Bilateral scattered groundglass opacities, concerning for pneumonia.
Right lower lobe consolidation may represent pneumonia and atelectasis.
Small right pleural effusion.
Interval increase in size of right paraspinal mass from [**7-7**].
No new bony destruction to suggest osteomyelitis.
No evidence of metastatic lesion.
CXR [**2104-8-25**]:COMPARED TO [**2104-8-22**], THE DEGREE OF PULMONARY EDEMA, PLEURAL FFUSION (RIGHT>LEFT) AND MULTIFOCAL ATELECTASIS/AIR SPACE DISEASE (WORSE AT THE BASES), IS UNCHANGED  Brief Hospital Course: 69M with recently diagnosed high grade sarcoma s/p resection presented from NH with hypoxic respiratory failure, elevated INR, leukocytosis.
Repeat CT scan one week after admission demonstrated rapid progression of tumor with increasing size of RP mass.
The pt was noted to have worsening neurologic function in his LEs with sensation nearly absent in LLE and mostly absent (to ~knee) on RLE and motor essentially absent in b/l extremities.
At the time of transfer from the MICU, the pt had elected to pursue palliative XRT for tumor control and possible symptomatic benefit.
He [**Month/Day (4) 1834**] several treatments, and had severe difficulty with pain during positioning during the procedure.
He seemed to have good pain control with this regimen if he was not being moved or transferred.
The patient received a total of 6 treatments with radiation therapy and decided not to complete all 10 treatments due to severe pain related to movement for these treatments.
## Respiratory failure: The etiology of the pt's respiratory failure was thought to most likely be aspiration with a possible component of fluid overload.
He continued to have O2 requirement of 3 LNC even on the floor.
This was felt to be likely secondary to atelectasis.
His continued O2 requirement during his stay was felt to be due to atelectasis and mild acute diastolic heart failure.
## Anemia of chronic disease: The patient was transfused 2 units of PRBC prior to discharge for hematocrit of 22, along with IV Lasix.
## Paraspinal soft tissue infection: The pt had findings on CT with air and stranding concerning for infection with gas producing organism.
The pt's surgical teams were consulted and felt that these findings were likely consistent with post-operative change.
Towards the end of his MICU stay, the pt was noted to develop a low-grade temp and WBC count, and therefore was started on an emperic 7-[**Known lastname **] course of vancomycin and Zosyn, which he completed.
## Pain control/ileus: The pt had been requiring increasing doses of narcotics at rehab to achieve adequet pain control.
During this admission, he was very initially very uncomfortable and frequent adjustment of his medication regimen was required to achieve adequent pain control without excessive sedation or illeus (pt required several [**Known lastname **] of NG decompression after extubation).
The patient was requiring very high amounts of pain medications to control his pain, and he had pain with very minimal movement.
Because the patient would be unable to  transport from home to XRT due to his severe pain, it was decided to pursue XRT in house.
The chronic pain service was reconsulted after it was noted the pt continued to have somnolence but pain at the same time.
An intrathecal pump was considered, but patient's pain improved with MSIR alone, requiring higher doses of narcotics only with movement and decision was made not to place an intrathecal pump.
?reason not totally clear, although it was likely for DVT prophylaxis.
Pt w/ paroxysmal AF here, though no known prior h/o AF.
He was noted to have excoriations and sacral ulcers.
A flexiseal was initially placed and then removed due to severe excoriation in the area.
He has a foley due to urinary incontinence related to his sarcoma.
