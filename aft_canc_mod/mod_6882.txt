Pertinent Results: Labs on Admission: [**2145-6-19**] 11:00PM BLOOD WBC-9.0 RBC-3.77* Hgb-11.3* Hct-33.1* MCV-88 MCH-29.9 MCHC-34.0 RDW-13.7 Plt Ct-328 [**2145-6-19**] 11:00PM BLOOD Neuts-75.4* Lymphs-20.2 Monos-2.7 Eos-1.6 Baso-0.1 [**2145-6-19**] 11:00PM BLOOD Glucose-120* UreaN-19 Creat-0.9 Na-145 K-4.3 Cl-114* HCO3-21* AnGap-14 [**2145-6-20**] 08:35AM BLOOD Phenyto-13.2  Imaging: Head CT [**6-19**]: FINDINGS: There is a 2.8 x 3.2 x 2.3 cm mildly hyperdense right frontal lesion near the vertex with a hypodense interior that avidly enhances.
There does not appear to be cortical erosion of bone or hyperostosis.
There is no pronounced perilesional edema.
No other mass is seen.
There is small calcification in the left temporal lobe.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
IMPRESSION: Right frontal enhancing mass with necrotic interior most likely a brain neoplasm.
Consider MR for further characterization.
There are no concerning airspace opacities, or pulmonary nodules.
There is no pleural effusion.
There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, hilum, or axilla according to CT size criteria.
There are subcentimeter lymph nodes in the axilla; however do not meet the CT criteria for pathological enlargement.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast symmetrically with bilateral hypodensities too small to characterize, likely small renal cysts.
There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum or mesentery.
The loops of small and large bowel appear normal.
There is no free fluid.
There is no free air.
The sigmoid and loops of small bowel within the pelvis appear normal.
There is no free fluid in the pelvis.
There are no enlarged lymph nodes in the pelvic or inguinal area according to CT size criteria.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen in the bones.
No evidence of primary tumor in the CT torso.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
MRI Head [**6-22**]: FINDINGS: There is a 2.7 cm round circumscribed extra-axial mass at the right vertex, depressing the paracentral lobule inferiorly.
There is mild associated vasogenic edema in the adjacent frontal and parietal lobes.
The mass demonstrates isointensity on the pre-contrast T1-weighted images, mild hyperintensity on T2-weighted images, neither fast nor slow diffusion, and predominantly solid enhancement with a small non-enhancing center on the postcontrast T1-weighted images.
A small portion of the non-enhancing center demonstrates low signal on the gradient-echo images without evidence of blooming, which is somewhat more likely to represent calcification rather than blood products.
Faint hyperdensity within the mass on the preceding CT scan is compatible with either calcification or blood products.
Overall, the mass is most consistent with a meningioma.
No other intra-axial or extra-axial masses are seen.
There is no acute infarction.
IMPRESSION: 2.7 cm extra-axial mass at the right vertex, most likely a meningioma, with mild vasogenic edema in the paracentral lobule.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 41F who is transferred from OSH after identification of new right parietal mass in the setting of seizure.
The patient went to the OR for craniotomy on [**6-23**] and the procedure went well without complications.
She had a post-op MRI which showed expected surgical changes without evidence of new infarct.

Parietal Mass   Discharge Condition: Neurologically Stable   Discharge Instructions: General Instructions/Information  ?????
?Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
?Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
?Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
?You have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
?You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
?New onset of tremors or seizures.
?Any confusion or change in mental status.
?Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
?Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
?Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
