Family History: No known family history of cancer or other pertinent family hx.
Pulm: No dullness to percussion, end exp wheezes throughout, no crackles.
No spinal tenderness.
Extremities: wwp, no edema.
Skin: no rashes or bruising, hairs noted on LE, no evidence of venous stasis Neuro/Psych: CNs II-XII intact.
Rectal tone intact.
Interval decrease in multiple mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
MR of the L-spine is more sensitive for evaluation of the central canal, however, no gross evidence of spine or central canal involvement is noted.
Mild collapse of the L4 vertebral body inferior endplate and L3 vertebral body superior endplate is new since [**2179**] and may represent lymphomatous involvement.
Diffuse ulcerated soft plaque throughout the aorta with an unchanged infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 32 x 35 mm.
CT head [**2181-11-22**]:  No acute intracranial process including no evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect.
Mediastinal contours are unchanged including mild prominence of the aortopulmonic window due to known lymph nodes.
Hilar prominence due to known lymph nodes on the left is unchanged as well.
There is no interval development of focal abnormality, but diffuse prominence of the perihilar interstitium and lower lungs might be consistent with interval development of pulmonary edema versus infectious process such as mycoplasma or viral infection.
No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.

# Altered Mental Status: The Patient was sent to the MICU with with altered mental status and hypercarbia.
CT head was negative for acute intracranial processes.
Her AMS was likely secondary to hypoventilation due to opiates as she became lethargic and desaturated after administration of oxycodone, prompting initiation of BiPAP.
She was kept on short acting opiates prior to discharge with follow up in [**Hospital 3242**] clinic for management of her lower back pain.
# Respiratory Depression: She was sent to the ICU for hypoventilation and hypercarbia in the setting of long acting opiates and underlying obstructive lung disease.
Her long acting opiates were stopped and her respiratory status improved and she was gradually transitioned from BiPAP to face mask and eventually weaned to 2L nasal cannula before call out to the floor.
She had evidence of mild pulmonary edema on CXR and was given gentle diuresis with IV lasix 10mg x2.
She was also given albuteral and ipratropium nebs for her underlying asthma/COPD due to concern she may have had a COPD/Asthma exacerbation.
#Back pain:  She presented with pronounced back pain which was moderately controlled at home on oxycontin 10mg TID, vicodin for break through.
Likely a combination of chronic spinal stenosis (pain previously improved w/PT), now w/evidence of lymphomatous involvement of L3-L4 on imaging.
The imaging had suggested that this may represent lytic metastases of her lymphoma verses infection.
CT did not reveal any spinal cord involvement and the patient was mobile from bed to chair with assistance and did not exhibit a sensory level to suggest intra-spinal abscess.
However, she developed respiratory depression after the initiation of long acting opiates, and she was resumed on short acting opiates after she was briefly admitted to the ICU for respiratory monitoring in addition to hypoglycemia.
Upon return to the floor her pain was well controlled with short acting opiates.
CT torso w/contrast revealed involvement of L4, MRI more sensitive; no evidence of cord involvement.
#Hypoglycemia with DM2: HgbA1c 7.6 on [**2181-7-23**].
Patient persistently hypoglycemic during admission w/finger stick glucose values ranging from 40s-90s; pt was written for home regimen, however did not receive any of her standing or sliding scale insulin.
Her hypoglycemia was probably secondary to poor PO intake due to persistent pain.
Adrenal insufficiency was ruled out with a fasting cortisol.
#Anemia: Likely secondary to her underlying lymphoma, diabetes, chronic disease.
Of note, she did receive additional nebs in the ICU for concern of a COPD flare.
However, upon arrival to the floor her respiratory depression and hypercarbia were thought to be secondary to opiates and not an underlying flare of her obstructive respiratory disease.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Multicultural [**Hospital1 269**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Lower Back Pain .
Secondary Diagnosis: Lymphoma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Imaging of the spine revealed degenerative changes in the spine, and potentially cancer in the spine.
Your hospital course was complicated by an admission to the ICU due to an episode of slow breathing, as well as low blood sugars.
Your blood sugars are normal, and your pain is now well controlled.
