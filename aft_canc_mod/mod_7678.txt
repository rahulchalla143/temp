#Left main bronchial obstruction/hypoxia/h/o NSCLC: The patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with shortness of breath and hypoxia.
He was subsequently found to have near total collapse of his left lung with mediastinal shift towards the collapsed lung on chest X-ray.
The patient has a  known tumor in left mainstem region.
He has had 3 previous bronchial stents for left main bronchial obstruction and hypoxia .
A repeat chest xray immediately following the procedure showed reinflation of the upper lobe but persistant collapse in the lower lobe.
The patient was noted to have desaturations into the 80s on ambulatory pulse ox, but remained asymptomatic with no shortness of breath during these episodes.
# Presumed Post Obstructive Pneumonia-  During the bronchoscopy the patient was noted to have several thick mucous plugs, and per Interventional pulmonary was started on Levofloxacin for presumptive  post-obstructive pneumonia.
His BAL cultures grew oxacillin sensitive staph aureus which was also sensitive to levofloxacin.
#Anemia, NOS: During his stay in the MICU the patient was noted to have a drop in  hematocrit from 41.9 pre-operatively to 32.1 post-op day 1.
He received 3.5 liters of normal saline during his MICU stay and the drop was thought to possibly be dilution versus peri-procedural bleeding.
The patient maintained good urine output with no signs of end organ damage such chest pain or decreased urine output and no obvious sign of bleeding were noted.
You were found to have near total collapse of your left lung due to an obstruction of one of the main airways.
You were also found to have a pneumonia and were started on antibiotics to treat the infection.
