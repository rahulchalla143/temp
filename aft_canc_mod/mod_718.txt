Brief Hospital Course: 59 year old male with history of hepatitis C cirrhosis and recurrent HCC as well as stage IV CKD who presents with [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD.
# VARICEAL BLEED:  He had a very large upper GI bleed on [**2106-4-11**] secondary to known esophageal varices.
He had no further bleeding episodes and transfused 2 units of FFP [**4-12**] for elevated INR with some transient improvement and was extubated.
Hepatitis C cirrhosis (decompensated): Following esophageal bleed, and stably worsening liver function, it was felt that the patient was not a candidate for TIPS or liver [**Month/Year (2) **].
# AOCKD: Cr elevated from 3.2 on [**2106-3-5**] to 6 on admission.
Sources considered for decompesnation included SBP (paracentesis negative), GI bleed (guiaic negative, pt without symptoms), and portal [**Last Name (un) **] thrombosis (RUQ U/S was negative).
Patient presentation felt to be most consistent with hepato-renal syndrome.
Hypertension: Patient was not hypertensive in house, although he was off his blood pressure medication.
Thrombocytopenia: Patient has platelt of 76, drop in 6 days from 207 on admission, and has intermittently received heparin here in house as well as on admission on [**2106-3-5**].
There is an intermediate probability that this patient has HITT based on the 4T score.
However, heparin antibody was negative, and patient's thrombocytopenia was attributed to his liver disease, and heparin SC was restarted.
Elevated lactate: Noted to be elevated on admission to 3.5.
Patient without anion gap currently, and without hypoperfusion physiology.
Lactate felt to be most likely secondary patient's known malignancy.
Elevated cardiac enzymes: Likely elevated in the setting of kidney injury, and stable without chest pain and without acute changes on EKG.
GERD: Managed with rantidine in house secondary to initial concerns for AIN, was switched to home dose of pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q24H on discharge  #.
Chronic Pain: Patient was started on 30 Q AM / 20 Q PM doses of his home methadone given his acute kidney injury.
# Macrocytic anemia: Most consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation given elevated ferritin, normal iron.
Discharge Medications: None  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: - Hepatorenal syndrome - Hepatitis C Cirrhosis - Hepatocellular Carcinoma   Discharge Condition: patient expired   Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 805**], was admitted because he was found to be in renal failure, his hospital course was complicated by a large variceal bleed.
Given his multiple comorbidities and decompensated liver disease, after a family meeting it was decided to make him comfort measures only and he passed away on inpatient hospice.
