Biliary mass:  The patient tolerated the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedure with stent well and liver function tests declined after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedure.
The 8D cells sampled on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography were found to be atypical, likely thought to be cholangiocarcinoma versus pancreatic cancer.
A CT with aortic protocol was performed.
Right renal mass:  This is suspected to be renal cell carcinoma based on the CT urogram findings.
Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease status post lung reduction surgery with home O2:  The patient is currently relatively well compensated on his meter dose inhalers with occasional nebulizer use.
Pulmonary consulted on this patient and felt that he had severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and was a significant perioperative pulmonary risk.
Cardiovascular:  Congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, the patient's echocardiogram showed systolic dysfunction with ejection fraction of approximately 30%.
It also showed a mild perfusion defect of the inferoapical wall with partial reversibility and also global hypokinesis.
Cardiac catheterization showed normal pulmonary wedge pressures again and ejection fraction of 30%, overall hypokinetic motion, no focal stenoses though diffuse disease in the right coronary artery and the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery as well as the proximal circumflex.
He was in sinus rhythm with regard to his atrial fibrillation after being placed on a beta blocker and having his Verapamil tapered down.
His anticoagulation, which had been held at the initial time of his bleed was held on discharge given his risk of bleeding from his biliary tumor.
The patient should call your primary care physician or come to the Emergency Department if he has fevers or chills, nausea, vomiting, bleeding from below or worsening abdominal pain.
You should make your dentist aware that you require prophylaxis and you should call your primary care physician for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] prescription for a dental appointment.
Given your bleeding from biliary system you should not restart your Coumadin.
You should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of vascular surgery.
Atrial fibrillation.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Coronary artery disease.
Abnormal liver function studies.
Right renal mass.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm.
DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Biliary obstruction relieved with stent, hematocrit stable, appetite improved.
