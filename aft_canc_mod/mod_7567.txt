If BRAF wildtype, there will be no therapeutic options.
Past Medical History: Oncologic History (metastatic melanoma w/peritoneal carcinomatosis): [**2134-3-22**] CT abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a moderate-to-large amount of abdominal ascites with extensive carcinomatosis and hepatic metastasis potential measuring 1.3 cm.
[**2134-3-22**] CT scan abdomen and pelvis, diffuse peritoneal thickening and nodularity consistent with carcinomatosis.
Moderate-to-large amount of abdominal and pelvic ascites.
1.3 cm right posterior segment liver lesion.
Liver diffusely low density consistent with fatty infiltration.
[**2134-3-23**] numerous calcified bilateral pleural plaques bilaterally indicating asbestos exposure, well-marginated fluid collection in the mediastinum in station 2R and 4R 2.6 cm in width.
[**2134-3-29**] PET scan, extensive soft tissue density along the anterior peritoneum consistent with diffuse omental caking with marked hypermetabolism, maximum SUV 9.
Diffuse perisplenic and perihepatic ascites, omental implants anterior to the liver, relatively focal areas of hypermetabolism adjacent to the liver.
Essentially physiologic distribution elsewhere in chest, abdomen and pelvis.
Small amount of fluid in the pericardial recesses.
[**2134-4-1**] PET scan, MRI brain, no findings for metastatic disease, nonspecific white matter abnormalities consistent with old microvascular infarcts.

DDx for ARF included compression of renal veins from ascites (abdominal compartment syndrome), prerenal ARF (high spec gravity on UA) [**3-4**] poor PO intake and/or third-spacing (due to malignancy causing exudative ascites; hypoalbuminemia also decreasing intravascular oncotic pressure), less likely ureteral/renal obstruction from mets (would need to be bilateral to cause Cr bump).
#Metastatic melanoma/Malignant ascites: Pt has been requiring ascitic fluid drainage every 3-4 days likely [**3-4**] increased vascular permeability and blockage of lymphatic drainage.
No clinical evidence of SBP and also labs were negative for bacterial growth.
Ascitic fluid labs (ANC 131 cells/uL; SAAG 0.9, ascitic-fluid-to-serum LDH ratio >1, protein >2.5) consistent with exudative ascites, non-infected.
A CT guided biopsy of a peritoneal tumor was performed by IR and sample was sent for BRAF V600E testing to determine whether pt is a candidate for vemurafenib.
Possible contribution from increased abdominal pressure pushing on IVC and decreasing preload.
AM cortisol 24 ruled out adrenal insufficiency.
Chronic Issues: #DM2: glipizide and metformin were held.

You were admitted to the hospital with low blood pressure, high potassium levels and kidney failure.
We have corrected these problems with IV fluids and medications and now your potassium level is normal, your blood pressure has improved and your kidneys are functioning back at your baseline.
The following changes have been made to your medications: STOP: Lisinopril, Tamsulosin because both medicines can lower your blood pressure  START: Furosemide 20mg by mouth daily to decrease potassium levels  Your potassium level was mildly elevated the day you left.
