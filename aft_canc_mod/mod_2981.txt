On [**2182-3-20**] Mrs. [**Known lastname **] underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial biopsy of the left main stem bronchus with Argon plasma coagulation of the bleeding mucosa of the left main stem bronchus for further evaluation of the left main stem occlusion with a tumor.
Over the next several days the patient continued to be short of breath while requiring non-rebreather face mask to maintain her oxygen saturation.
Bronchoscopy found abnormal oropharynx with poor dentition and abnormal areas with large amount of tumor in the left main stem bronchus and main to the left lower lobe.
Attention was made to destroy to coagulate the tumor with argon plasma coagulation.
In addition, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] was consulted during the procedure about the feasibility of placing a left main stem stent, but given that he planned for a possible lobectomy or pneumonectomy, he felt that a stent in the airway would not be appropriate.
Post procedure the patient had multiple bouts of hypotension and hypoxemia as well as during the procedure.
In addition, Hematology/Oncology was consulted for assistance in the treatment of her left main stem bronchus and the possible role of chemotherapy.
The pathology from [**2182-3-20**] showed non-small cell poorly differentiated lung carcinoma.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] had a head CT which was negative for metastases.
The CT scan on [**2182-3-19**] had documented the enhancing soft tissue mass within 2 cm of the carina and a question of an extrabronchial component of the neoplastic mass in the left hilum.
In addition, there were multiple right lung nodules which were concerning for metastases which were less than 5 mm.
Furthermore, there was an enlarged left adrenal gland which was indeterminate for malignancy.
In addition, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] had had an echocardiogram which showed left ventricular outflow track gradient of 37 and moderate left ventricular outflow obstruction as well as aortic stenosis.
In the [**Known lastname 52538**] Intensive Care Unit Mrs.[**Known lastname 52537**] chief problem was her respiratory failure, which was felt to be hypoxia secondary to shunt from the large endobronchial tumor obstructing her left main stem bronchi.
When the PEEP was decreased below 8, Mrs.[**Known lastname 52537**] left upper lobe was noted to collapse in addition to the persistent collapse of her left lower lobe.
The first occasion which her left upper lobe collapsed was on [**2182-4-1**] after having her morning radiation therapy.
An urgent bronchoscopy was performed which removed some mucus plugging and some bloody secretions and documented the tumor obstructing 75% of her left main stem bronchi.
It was felt that part of the difficulty weaning Mrs. [**Known lastname **] to pressure-support ventilation was secondary to volume overload given that she was significantly net positive and by chest x-ray had evidence of congestive heart failure.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was diuresed very gingerly secondary to episodes of hypotension and episodes of requiring pressors while in the Intensive Care Unit.
He felt that there was little role for a stent as the stent could not open up the obstruction in the left lower lobe and was only useful if there was persistent left upper lobe clots.
A repeat urgent bronchoscopy was performed which showed that the left main stem bronchus appeared to be about 85% occluded by the tumor at this point.
She had significant blood secretions and adherent mucus secretions in her airway.
The repeat chest CT scan was unable to fully assess the right lung field for the nodules which were again seen secondary to motion artifact.
On [**2182-4-12**], a chest CT scan did show worsening bilateral pleural effusions and persistent left lower lobe collapse and probable direct invasions of the mass in the mediastinum posteriorly.
Her other chief medical problems during her stay in the [**Name (NI) 52538**] Intensive Care Unit from the date [**2182-3-28**] to [**2182-4-10**] included episodes of hypotension requiring intermittent pressure support with Neo-Synephrine as well as congestive heart failure complicated by hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy requiring careful diuresis.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] initially expressed a wish not to be resuscitated if her heart were to stop.
However, Mrs.[**Known lastname 52537**] mental status began to wax and wane during her Intensive Care Unit stay, so the team felt that it was appropriate to continue Mrs. [**Known lastname **] as a Full Code in accordance with her husband's wishes as she did not appear to have the capacity to make the decision on her own.
