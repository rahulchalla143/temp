CYTOLOGY: [**2168-5-11**] common bile duct brushings: Atypical glandular cells [**2168-5-11**] common hepatic duct brushings: A few groups of highly atypical glandular cells, see note.
[**2168-5-16**] omental node pathology: -Metastatic, well differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with pancreaticobiliary origin in the appropriate clinical setting.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 91793**] was admitted to the Hepatobiliary surgical service on [**2168-5-10**] because of poor oral intake due to nausea and vomiting in the setting of gastric outlet obstruction of unclear etiology.
