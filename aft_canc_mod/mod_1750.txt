Admission Date:  [**2155-6-30**]       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2094-12-9**]       Sex:  M  Service:  ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Status post Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **] esophagogastrectomy complicated by anastomotic leak.
He underwent an uncomplicated procedure and was noted to have a cirrhotic liver in the OR.
On postoperative day #6 he developed a fever to 101.4 and subsequent respiratory distress requiring intubation.
Chest CT with Methylene Blue via chest tube showed a mediastinal leak.
He had a sputum positive for MRSA.
On postoperative day #10 repeat CT scan showed gross extravasation of contrast with apparent anastomotic collection and a large right pleural effusion.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes mellitus, Barrett's esophagus, esophageal adenocarcinoma, villous pemphigoid, history of GI bleed, iron deficiency anemia, history of urinary incontinence.
On CT chest the findings were a right lower lobe collapse, two small anastomotic leaks decompressed by chest tube.
He also underwent a bronchoscopy which showed mucus plugs and was otherwise normal.
He was noted to have elevated LFTs on the initial lab work with a total bilirubin of 11.9 and also raised BUN and creatinine.
He also underwent a right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed minimal edema in the gallbladder wall and a small amount of fluid around the gallbladder consistent with ascites.
There was no evidence of gallstones, biliary dilation or hepatic parenchymal abnormality.
On [**7-3**] he was noted to have increased respiratory secretions requiring Ambu bagging, lavage and suctioning.
He was tachypneic and hypotensive.
On [**7-4**] it was noted that he spiked a fever to 101.6.
There was no abscess noted.
The CT also showed persistent ground glass opacities scattered throughout both lungs.
Underlying pneumonia could not be excluded.
His bilateral effusions had improved somewhat on the CT.  Over the course of [**7-4**] and [**7-5**] he was weaned slowly to C-PAP, his low grade temperature continued.
He had a weak cough and he was wheezing which improved with treatment.
He continued to have diarrhea and his fluid was sent for C. diff.
On [**7-10**] due to persistent tachypnea and difficulty handling secretions, a pulmonary consult was obtained.
It was noted by them that he had many reasons for tachypnea, mainly his pain, stomach and right chest, thoracotomy, right lower lobe consolidation.
On the early morning of [**7-11**] he had an episode of tachypnea and he was agitated.
He continued to be stable during the day but had high nursing requirements with frequent respiratory care requirements.
He also underwent a CT angiogram to rule out PE and contrast was given to evaluate for a leak.
There was no evidence of PE, there was no evidence of leak from the esophagus.
The CT also showed small bilateral pleural effusions with a loculated component at the right upper lobe posteriorly.
There was no evidence of pneumothorax.
There was a probable post inflammatory nodule at the left apex and there was a right lower lobe collapse.
He continued to be stable though he had episodes of respiratory distress which improved with treatment.
On [**7-14**] an ENT consult was obtained for possibility of tracheomalacia or upper airway obstruction.
A laryngoscopy at this time revealed no evidence of upper airway obstruction.
His Foley was discontinued on [**7-17**] and he had no difficulty voiding urine.
Microbiology on this admission:  [**6-30**]:  Urine culture, no growth.
Blood culture, aerobic and anaerobic bottle, no growth.
Culture showed staph aureus coag positive, Oxacillin resistant, also sparse growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Sputum [**7-3**], gram stain more than 25 PMN's, 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
Culture positive for staph aureus coagulase positive.
Blood culture [**7-3**], no growth.
[**7-4**] blood culture, no growth.
[**7-8**], Clostridium difficile negative.
[**7-9**], Clostridium difficile negative.
[**7-10**], Clostridium difficile negative.
