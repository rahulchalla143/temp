Admission Date:  [**2115-9-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2115-9-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2039-4-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Shellfish  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**] Chief Complaint: ?GI bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 4541**] is a 76 year-old female with past medical history of myelodysplastic syndrome (finished her third cycle of 5-Azacitidine four days prior to admission), status post recent MI who was transferred from an OSH status post one episode of brown emesis.
She went for her chemotherapy with Vadasa and was found to have low hematocrit and thrombocytopenia.
She states that over the past few days she has had diffuse abdominal pain with "gas pains" through her abdomen and pain in her upper back.
She had one episode of brown emesis, but did not note streaks of blood or coffee ground emesis.
She denies diarrhea and states she has been constipated over the past few days.
She has occasionally noted small amounts of bright red blood on her toilet paper, but none in the toilet.
The day or admission she states that she initially had constipation and then one large loose brown bowel movement.
She presented to an OSH for the emesis and abdominal pain.
She was found to have guaiac positive brown stool on exam.
Her SBPs trended down to the upper 80s and she was transfused an additional unit of PRBCs for possible bleed (hematocrit was around 29 at that time and had risen appropriately).
She was also noted to be slightly hypoxic with O2 saturations 92% off O2.
The relative hypoxia was believed to be secondary to some component of volume overload.
(+) abdominal pain (+) fatigue (+) occasional headache  Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1.
Coronary artery disease status post Cypher stent to LAD [**11-30**] off Plavix shortly thereafter with oncology input; recent MI [**7-31**] treated medically secondary to thrombocytopenia.
Stress MIBI [**9-6**] showed moderate inferolateral reversible defect.
Hypertension 5.
Hypercholesterolemia 6.
Left nephrectomy 20 years ago secondary to nephrolithiasis 9.
Sister died at 59 of heart disease.
Brother with myocardial infarction at age 63, son in 40s.
No evidence of retroperitoneal or other intraabdominal hemorrhage.
Extensive atherosclerotic disease.
Status post left nephrectomy.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Severe degenerative disease throughout the lumbar spine.
ECG Study Date of [**2115-9-23**] Sinus rhythm Atrial premature complex Nonspecific inferolateral ST-T wave abnormalities Since previous tracing of 9=18-06, T wave changes slightly less prominent .
There is no pleural effusion.
Mild cardiomegaly is stable, and pulmonary vasculature is mildly engorged.
There is no free subdiaphragmatic gas.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2115-9-25**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**9-24**]: Borderline cardiomegaly unchanged.
Mediastinal fullness and leftward tracheal deviation suggest an enlarged right thyroid lobe.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 year-old female with MDS on chemotherapy with several days of increasing lethargy, small amounts of BRBPR, and one episode of brown emesis transferred from OSH with worsening anemia and thrombocytopenia.
Her anemia is likely secondary to recent chemotherapy and her underlying disease with some component of gastrointestinal losses.
The patient was admitted with abdominal pain and one episode of brown emesis.
She complained of occasional small amounts of bright red blood per rectum over the course of the week.
Possible sources for bleed are hemorrhoids in the setting of thrombocytopenia (the patient has a history of hemorrhoids), gastritis secondary to steroids, polyps, AVMs, or diverticula.
She had no episodes of overt GI bleeding during hospitalization although she was guaiac positive on admission.
Gastroenterology believed the presumed upper GI bleeding to be secondary to steroid gastritis versus lower GI bleeding from diverticula.
The patient's oncologist did not want the patient to continue on aspirin with her history of MDS and thrombocytopenia and the patient was instructed not to restart aspirin.
The patient complained of diffuse lower abdominal pain on admission.
CT abdomen showed evidence of diverticulitis as above.
No evidence for ischemia.
Lactate remained elevated and was believed secondary to the patient's underlying hematologic malignancy.
The patient's abdominal pain was resolved on discharge.
Myelodysplastic syndrome.
WBC was elevated at 34 on admit with evidence of atypical cells on smear.
History of recent myocardial infarction.
The patient has a recent history of inferior myocardial infarction.
Cardiac enzymes were slightly elevated on admission, likely secondary to demand.
Acute renal failure.
Consistent with pre-renal etiology.
Elevated lactate.
The patient's lactate remained elevated on admission.
The elevated lactate was likely secondary to the patient's underlying hematologic malignancy.
