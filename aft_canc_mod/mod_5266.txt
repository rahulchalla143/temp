He was h/o chronic anemia with baseline Hct 25-30 secondary to warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Chronic kidney disease, and myelodysplasia.
He had recent admission for HCT drop and upper endoscopy which showed a non-bleeding duodenal polyp and a small hiatal hernia.
He has history of esophageal erosions/non bleeding stomach ulcers/gastritis/lymphangiectasias.
However, pt did also have radiation for prostate cancer which could lead to a lower GI etiology.
The EGD showed a small hernia but was otherwise normal with no identifiable source of bleeding.
# Atrial fibrillation - pt had new onset a fib with RVR to 130s-150s on hospital day number 2.
At discharge, heart rate noted to be regular with sinus rhythm on EKG.
# Possible Bacteremia - blood cultures on [**12-24**], drawn in setting of temp to 100.6, with one out of four bottles positive for Gram + rods and Gram + cocci.
# CAD s/p NSTEMI: Pt with shoulder pain in ED.
During last admission had left arm pain which was felt to be the result of demand ischemia in the setting of an acute HCT drop.
# Aortic mechanical valve:  Noted to have supratherapeutic INR of 6.1 on admission (normally his goal INR is 2.5-3.5).
# Stage III CKD: Baseline appears to be 1.2 to 1.3 since [**Month (only) 216**].
Pt at recent creatinine baseline.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Gastrointestinal bleeding Bacteremia Atrial fibrillation  Secondary: Aortic mechanical valve Autoimmune hemolytic anemia Chronic kidney disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab to [**Hospital1 18**] for a drop in your hematocrit (red blood cell count) and dark stools suggesting bleeding in your GI tract.
The gastroenterologists evaluated you and did an EGD (upper endoscopy) which showed a small hernia but was otherwise normal.
Your blood counts remained stable and there was no further evidence of active gastrointestinal bleeding.
Before the procedue, you were found to have an arrhythmia in your heart called atrial fibrillation.
