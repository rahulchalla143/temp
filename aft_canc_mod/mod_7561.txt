While upper respiratory symptoms began three days ago, patient first noted fever of 100.2 this morning.
Patient has had malaise, aches, vomiting and cough productive of white sputum sputum as well.
Because of his vomiting and diarrhea, he has had decreased oral intake.
He also notes headaches, responsive to Tylenol, without any visual changes or neck stiffness.
He denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, neck stiffness, changes in vision, hematuria, dysuria, hematochezia, hematemesis or new rashes.
He notes that the infection on his left leg is improving.
Of note, his wife has been sick at home with an ear infection and cough.

Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY He originally presented to [**Hospital3 **] ED with dyspnea on exertion and lower extremity edema.
Labs showed him to be anemic with a Hgb of 7.1 and Hct of 21 and thrombocytopenic with a platelet count of 13,000.
A bone marrow biopsy was performed and per OSH records pathology was consistent with acute leukemia, although no Heme/Path reports were sent.
He was started on Hyper C-VAD part A on [**2132-3-22**], which was complicated by tumor lysis syndrome and low-grade DIC.
During his nadir on [**2132-3-29**] he spiked a fever and was started on Cefepime and vancomycin.
An echo showed no signs of vegetation, and a replacement PICC was placed after 48 hours of remaining afebrile.
Several days later he spiked fevers again and was noted to have infiltrates on CT suggestive of multi-focal pneumonia, a subsequent bronch with BAL demonstrated MRSA.
Repeat echo again did not show any evidence of vegetations.
This was felt to be secondary to an episode of relative hypotension coupled with toxic levels of vancomycin.
A bone marrow biopsy on day +23 of his treatment showed no evidence of leukemia and normal cytogenetics indicative of remission.
After his discharge on [**2132-4-18**], he was re-admitted on [**2132-4-22**] with a diffuse rash and a RUE DVT at his PICC.
The rash was thought to be due either to nifedipine, which was started during his prior admission for hypertension, or vancomycin, although this was thought to be less likely because he did not havedesquamation.
Instead of completing a 3 week course of vancomycin, this drug was stopped after approximately 2 weeks due to development of his rash as per ID recommendations, and he was discharged on [**2132-4-25**] off antibiotics.
Ultimately he ended up having 4 weekly doses of prophylactic IT methotrexate given locally by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his last dose was on [**2132-6-17**].
His post-transplant course has been complicated by MRSA bacteremia, acute kidney injury d/t tacrolimus toxicity (was accidentally given 10 mg of tacro versus 1 mg), urinary BK virus, and CMV viremia requiring therapy with Foscarnet.
On day +98 he was re-admitted with sudden onset RUQ abdominal pain and fever.
An ultrasound showed gallbladder sludge without cholecystitis and an ERCP was performed revealing blocked common bile duct.
A sphincterotomy was performed with extraction of sludge, stone fragments, and a small amount of pus.His total bilirubin was elevated to 10.3 several days s/p ERCP with stenting.
A repeat ERCP and MRCP showed no residual biliary obstruction.
In [**2132-11-1**], pulmonary nodules noted on CT scan, and aspergillus in sputum.

This study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
Once again, there is air in the gallbladder and a 14-mm hypodensity in the interpolar region of the left kidney, probably a cyst, present without appreciable change since [**2132-5-2**].
There is no adrenal mass.
Extensive bronchiolar consolidation in the posterior and apical segments of the left upper lobe, in the superior segment of the left lower lobe, and in the lateral and posterior basal segments of both lower lobes, converges into consolidation at the left base is all new since [**12-10**] when there was only a very small region of bronchiolar nodulation in the superior segment of the right lower lobe, subsequently cleared.

These appears similar to the opacities seen on the recent CT scan, and likely represent an atypical infection.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Multifocal pneumonia appears similar to recent CT scan and likely represents a viral or bacterial infection.
Stable rightward tracheal deviation secondary to known enlarged thyroid.
However, there are no new foci of consolidations.
Previously visualized cavitary lesions including 8 mm fluid-filled cavitary lesion in the right middle lobe (3:27) and 6 mm fluid filled cavitary lesion in the superior segment of the left lower lobe (3:30) have remained stable.
There are no new cavitary lesions.
The non-opacified portions of the heart and great vessels appear stable with atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic arch.

There were frequent bifrontally predominant or independent, right more than left, frontocentral spike and wave epileptiform discharges with phase reversals at F4-C4 and C4.
At times, these bifrontally predominant spike and wave epileptiform discharges appeared to be periodic at 2.5 Hz for a few seconds at a time.
Review of the continuous EEG showed frequent frontal discharges with a prolonged run of 1 Hz periodic discharges in the frontal region for 10 seconds, but no video was available for clinical correlation.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were 330 automated spike detections predominantly for electrode and movement artifact but also for the epileptiform discharges in the bilateral frontal and right frontocentral regions.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were 12 automated seizure detections predominantly for muscle artifact and for 2.5 Hz periodic spike and wave bifrontal discharges.
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were no pushbutton activations.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of frequent epileptiform discharges in the bilateral frontal or right frontocentral regions which are briefly periodic, at times, for few seconds without clear clinical change seen on video.
There was a prolonged run of such discharges lasting 10 seconds suggestive of a brief electrographic seizure, but no video was available for clinical correlation.
These findings are indicative of epileptogenic cortex in the bilateral frontal regions and right more than left.
The background showed generalized slowing in the theta frequency range indicative of mild to moderate diffuse encephalopathy which is etiologically non- specific.
There were frequent bifrontally predominant or independent, right more than left, frontocentral spike and wave epileptiform discharges with phase reversals at F4-C4 and C4.
At times, these bifrontally predominant spike and wave epileptiform discharges appeared to be periodic at 1-2 Hz for several seconds but did not have any clear clinical correlate.
Review of the continuous EEG showed frequent such discharges during the evening and night recording with two prolonged runs of 1 Hz periodic discharges for 15 seconds.
There was no video recording available at these times to clinically correlate with these runs of periodic discharges.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were six automated seizure detections predominantly for muscle artifact.
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were no pushbutton activations.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of frequent epileptiform discharges in the bifrontal or right frontocentral region which were briefly periodic at 1-2 Hz, at times, for a few seconds without clear clinical correlate.
There were two more prolonged bursts lasting up to 15 seconds consistent with electrographic seizures.
These findings are indicative of potentially epileptogenic cortex in the bilateral frontal regions and right more than left.
The background shows generalized background slowing in the theta frequency range, indicative of mild to moderate diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically non-specific.
Compared to the prior day's recording, there appears to be a deterioration due to the more frequent bifrontal epileptiform discharges and two prolonged bursts of periodic discharges lasting 15 seconds.
The right lung is now clear without consolidation.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
There is no pulmonary edema.
[**2133-2-18**] BEDSIDE EEG WITH VIDEO: ROUTINE SAMPLING/CONTINUOUS EEG: The background activity showed a symmetric 7 Hz activity with excess diffuse beta activity.
There were frequent bifrontally predominant or independent right more than left frontocentral spike and wave epileptiform discharges with phase reversal at F4-C4 and C4.
At times, these bifrontally predominant spike and wave epileptiform discharges appeared to be periodic at 1.5-2 Hz for few seconds with no prolonged discharges on continuous EEG.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were no automated spike detections.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were four automated seizure detections predominantly for bursts of bifrontal discharges or for muscle artifact.
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were no pushbutton activations.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of frequent epileptiform discharges in the bifrontal or right frontocentral region which were briefly periodic at times for few seconds.
These findings are indicative of potentially epileptogenic cortex in the bifrontal, right more than left frontocentral regions.
The background showed generalized slowing in the theta frequency range indicative of mild to moderate diffuse encephalopathy which is etiologically non-specific.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 89956**] is a 61-year-old gentleman, with a PMH Ph+ ALL in remission s/p chemotherapy (DVA, Gleevec) and s/p MUD myeloablative allo-BMT [**2132-7-9**] c/b GVHD of the liver, CMV viremia, R leg Zygomycetes infection treated with ambisome/micafungin c/b PICC line thrombus and [**Last Name (un) **], admitted with fevers, malaise and URI symptoms, found to have RSV, with course complicated by seizures, acute on chronic gut GVHD, acute on chronic anemia, and brief orthostasis.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Febrile neutropenia secondary to RSV pneumonia: Patient's presentation, with overall malaise and upper respiratory symptoms were most consistent with a viral respiratory illness (most likely grandchildren were source of infection).
CT appearance was most consistent with atypical bacterial pneumonia vs. viral pneumonia.
He was also provided with Duonebs for shortness of breath and wheezing.
As the patient has a slow-growing AFB at the state lab from [**Month (only) **] and AFB on sputa from this admission, he was kept on airborne precautions.
# Seizures: Patient developed confusion and decreased responsiveness on [**2133-2-13**].
Initial differential for causes of encephalopathy included progression of pneumonia, lymphoma progression to CNS, other infection (including meningitis/encephalitis), seizure with prolonged post-ictal period, and PE.
Non-contrast CT head did not show any evidence of hemorrhage, edema or mass effect.
MRI head showed decreased subcortical T2 hyperenhancements when compared to prior, and no new abnormalities.
After treatment with palivizumab for RSV pneumonia, he began to have some clearing of his encephalopathy.
Neuro-Oncology weighed in, noting frontal lobar deficits on exam that raised suspicion for seizures.
EEG confirmed abnormal activity in bilateral frontal lobes.
Cause of seizures was most likely toxic-metabolic encephalopathy vs. lowered seizure threshold from fever, exacerbated by medications (?cefepime, ?tacrolimus).
# Acute on chronic GVHD: Patient with fluctuating volume and frequency of diarrhea during this admission.
This was most likely secondary to GVHD, as steroids had been reduced in the context of severe infection.
Stool volume and frequency lessened with increased doses of steroids.
# Acute on chronic anemia: Hematocrit fluctuated during this admission, ranging mostly 23-25.
Baseline chronic anemia is likely multifactorial, secondary to marrow suppression along with anemia of chronic disease.
There were no overt signs of bleeding, and labs not consistent with hemolysis.
# Orthostasis: Patient had a brief episode of orthostasis on [**2133-2-7**].
This was most likely secondary to infection, with poor PO intake and deconditioning.
Adrenal insufficiency was less likely given ongoing steroids.
At the time, blood pressure and FSBS were within normal range, with a high heart rate.
Orthostasis resolved.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # ALL: In remission now s/p chemotherapy and allogeneic transplant.
# Right leg zygomycetes infection: Patient and outpatient providers note that this is stable.
# Hypokalemia/hypomagnesemia: History of ongoing low potassium and magnesium, thought to be secondary to IV amphotericin treatment.
# Chronic renal insufficiency: Creatinine ranged 1.0-1.6 during this admission, around recent baseline 1.3-1.7.
# History of LUE PICC-associated DVT: No associated pain.
# History of wide-complex tachycardia: No issues during this admission.
