# Melena: The patient presented with one episode of melena after years on [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4532**] and recent episodes of increased etoh use.
He denied any sob, lightheadedness, dizziness, but did endorse mild fatigue.
Vital signs were stable and NG lavage showed no signs of acute bleed.
In the AM he underwent endoscopy with GI which revealed a 1cm gastric ulcer in the antrum, cratered but clean based without active bleeding or visible vessel.
Patient continued to be asymptomatic besides fatigue and was discharged with follow-up with PCP and instructions to return if he became symptomatic.
# CAD with [**Hospital1 **]: continued [**Hospital1 4532**] and [**Hospital1 **].
The attending on the patient had communicated with the patient's outpatient cardiologist and PCP regarding the fact that both protonix and plaxix would be given at the same time putting the patient at least at a theoretical risk for decreased effectiveness of [**Hospital1 4532**].
You underwent endoscopy showing a gastric ulcer likely responsible for your bleed.
You also have a blood test pending for a bacteria that can cause ulcers.
You will likely have some dark stools for the next few days, but please call or come back to the hospital if you develop frank bleeding, shortness of breath, chest pain, lightheadedness, or dizziness.
