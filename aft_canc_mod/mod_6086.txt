-[**6-28**] CXR: Substantial progression of consolidation in and around growing multiple lung nodules, accompanied by new left pleural effusion consistent with active spreading infection, more likely bacterial than fungal due to the rapid change.
Mild interstitial edema is also new, presumably reflecting interval volume support.
There is no pneumothorax.
A small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
Multifocal rounded opacities located throughout both lungs have minimally worsened consistent with worsening multifocal pneumonia   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is a 74 y/o F with recurrent AML who was admitted to the BMT service on [**2124-6-27**] for neutropenic fevers.
She continued to have high fevers with a max of 103F, and she had an oxygen requirement which slowly increased to 3 liters.
Follow up CXR with her developing oxygen requirement demonstrated multifocal pneumonia.
Of note the previous week, she has been admitted with pseudomonal bacteremia and pneumonia which was sensitive to zosyn.
The evening of [**2124-6-28**] the patient became unresponsive while transferring from the commode to the bed and was unresponsive.
The monitor was attached about 2 minutes into chest compressions, which showed sinus tachycardia.
