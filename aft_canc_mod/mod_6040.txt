IMAGING: CT HEAD W/OUT CONTRAST [**2118-4-10**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
ELBOW X-RAY [**2118-4-10**]: IMPRESSION: Mildly displaced comminuted lateral epicondyle fracture with 6 mm osseous fragment within the joint space.
PELVIC X-RAY [**2118-4-10**]: IMPRESSION: No definite fracture or dislocation.
If there is continuedconcern for a hip fracture, dedicated radiographs of the hip are recommended for further evaluation.
CXR [**2118-4-10**]: IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement and bibasilar atelectasis.
Echocardiogram (TTE) [**2118-4-12**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Severe pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-3-25**], tricuspid regurgitation is more prominent and pulmonary pressures are higher.
Left ventricular function and the other findings are similar  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 1617**] is a 88F with hx of CAD, AF on coumadin, CML, CRI who presented s/p fall and found to have UTI complicated by hypotension.
She subsequently developed pneumonia, complicated by sepsis, Afib with rapid ventricular response, and heart failure exacerbation.
# Urinary tract infection, complicate by sepsis: The patient's admission urine culture grew E. coli.
She was initially treated ceftriaxone, with was broadened to cefepime and vancomycin on [**4-11**] in the setting of hypotension and concern for sepsis.
Antibiotics were briefly narrowed to just ceftriaxone on [**4-13**] when the sensitivities of the E. coli became available, but were broadened to cefepime, vancomycin, and azithromycin the same day, as the patient's clinical condition worsened and it became clear that she also had pneumomia.
# Pneumonia: On [**4-13**], the patient developed increased respiratory distress.
CXR showed a right perihilar opacity that was concerning for pneumonia.
# Sepsis/Hypotension: On [**4-11**], the patient became hypotensive to the 60s.
She subsequently developed hypotension to the 70s, which responded to a 250-cc normal saline boluses.
Blood pressures stabilized without need for pressors.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient developed increasing respiratory distress, which was initially attributed to heart failure in the setting of fluid resuscitation for hypotension.
The patient developed worsening hypoxia, requiring high-flow masks and eventually non-invasive positive pressure ventillation.
As the patient's hypoxemia and dyspnea worsening, the patient and her family decided to focus her care on comfort.
# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient was initially treated with IV fluids for sepsis.
She subsequently developed increased work of breathing, which was multifactorial, related to pneumonia and CHF.
She was also given IV morphine and intermittently required BiPAP.
On [**4-17**], she decided to focus her care on comfort, with no further treatment for her worsening respiratory failure.
# Wide complex tachycardia: On [**4-13**], the patient a wide-complex tachycardia, which was likely due to Afib with aberrency.
# Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: On [**4-13**], the patient developed Afib, with RVR.
# Acute on chronic kidney injury: She has known CKD with baseline creatintine of 2.0.
Her acute kidney injury was likely pre-renal and improved with IV fluids.
# s/p fall: Patient reports this was a mechanical fall without associated LOC or syncope although hypotension may have constributed.
Her pain was treated with Tylenol.
# Coronary artery disease: Most recent echo showed EF of 35%, pt s/p PM and ICD placement, most recent cath in [**2103**] showed sizable inferior wall akinesis and RCA occlusion.
# CML: Continued Gleevec.
# Anemia: Her baseline hct is 35, and she is currently 30, with MCV of 106 (baseline in the 100's).
Her chronic anemia is likely [**12-15**] CML and treatment.
As the patient's respiratory status worsened, goals of care were again discussed, and the patient and her family again affirmed that the patient would not want to be intubated or resuscitated, even though she would likely die without intubation.
