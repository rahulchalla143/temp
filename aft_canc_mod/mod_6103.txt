Neuro:  He was initially on a PCA for pain control.
He did develop atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response requiring IV metoprolol and an IV amiodarone gtt.
He did have complaints of right sided chest pain that initially subsided with pain medication.
This pain persisted so a CTA of his chest was obtained and it revealed a right middle lobe subsegmental pulmonary embolus.
GI:  He underwent a successful minimally invasive esophagectomy.
His diet was advanced and initially he was doing quite well but then had this persistent right sided chest pain.
This was worked up and he was noted to have a PE but the pain persisted on anticoagulation.
Plain films were done to evaluate his neoesophagus and these were negative for dilatation.
An EGD was obtained and this showed an ulcer at the anastomotic site.
GU:  He voided without difficulty.
ID:  He was started on a course of cefazolin for erythema that developed around the cervical incision.
The erythema improved and he was discharged on no antibiotics.
