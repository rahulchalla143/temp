He presented with a three day history of abdominal pain.
He was found to have an incarcerated hernia and was admitted to the surgery service for successful repair.
After the surgery, he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with a left bundle branch block on his electrocardiogram.
He denies any chest pain or shortness of breath.
At home, the patient is very functional.
He does not complain of chest pain or shortness of breath.
He denies any orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, leg swelling.
Surgery service requested an echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 25%, normal left ventricular wall thickness and severe regional wall motion abnormalities; akinesis of the inferior septal wall; hypokinesis of the septal wall.
3+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ mitral regurgitation, moderate pulmonary hypertension.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Non Hodgkin's lymphoma in [**2185**], status post radiation treatment, status post CHOP chemotherapy in [**2186**] and [**2187**], currently in remission.
Interestingly, the patient was institutionalized as a child and has wariness for medical care.
No known drug allergies.
Sclera anicteric.
Has a glass eye in the right orbit.
Neck: Some jugular venous distention, no carotid bruits.
Chest: Mild crackles at bases.
CV: Irregularly irregular, no murmurs appreciated.
Extremities: Trace to 1+ edema bilaterally.
No femoral bruits.
Electrocardiogram showed left bundle branch morphology and irregularly irregular rhythm.
He had a dehiscence of the lower groin incision; however, the wound was clean and did not have any drainage.
Coronary artery disease:  The patient had an echocardiogram on [**2198-11-14**] which showed a moderately dilated left atrium.
Severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior akinesis, septal hypokinesis, apical hypokinesis/akinesis and hypokinesis elsewhere.
3+ mitral regurgitation.
2+ tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The patient was then taken for a cardiac catheterization on [**2198-11-16**] where he was found to have a diffuse 30% stenosis of the proximal right coronary artery, 30% stenosis at the mid right coronary artery and 60% stenosis at the distal right coronary artery.
He had discrete 30% stenosis of the left main, discrete 50% stenosis of the mid left anterior descending and a 90% stenosis of the diffusely diseased left circumflex.
Mildly elevated LVEDP.
No aortic stenosis.
Atrial fibrillation.
Successful stenting of the mid left circumflex.
He complained of no further chest pain.
However, during the course of subsequent events in the hospital and stresses, it was noted that when the patient had an increased heart rate, he had mildly elevated troponin 2.05, believed to be related to elevated heart rate.
Congestive heart failure:  The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for acute congestive heart failure exacerbation during the course of the hospitalization.
At the time of this dictation, he is well compensated without signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure.
Mental status change:  After the time of the patient's DC cardioversion, the patient was noted to have some mental status changes.
At that time, he had a CT scan and MR which were both negative for acute bleed.
However, the MR was poor study because of his movement.
He was also seen in consultation by the neurology service and an EEG was obtained which showed diffuse encephalopathy but no focal seizure activity.
It was felt that his change in mental status was secondary to delirium which could be caused by a multiple of factors including changes in electrolytes.
He also had a chest x-ray which showed a right lower lobe infiltrate, believed to be an aspiration pneumonia.
At that time, he was placed on Ceftriaxone and Flagyl to treat the aspiration pneumonia.
He had a total of two speech and swallow evaluations during his hospitalization, both of which showed contrast slipping into the trachea and not prompting a swallow reflex.
The cause of his decline in swallowing is thought to be secondary to his mental status changes and delirium.
Mental status changes:  The patient's mental status changes could be due to a number of causes during this hospitalization but, at the time of this dictation, his mental status has improved to the point where he is appropriately responding to sign language interpreters and his family, although he is extremely fatigued and weak and is not able to be attentive for more than a few minutes at a time.
Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure, Ejection fraction of 25%.
Atrial fibrillation.
