Liver US [**2170-6-26**]: The examination is limited due to body habitus.
Specifically, there is limited evaluation of the liver parenchyma and gallbladder; however, there is no evidence suggestive of cholecystitis such as no evidence of wall thickening, gallstones, or intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
A small amount of ascites is seen in the right lower quadrant.
MRI Abdomen [**2170-6-18**]: Examination of the liver and renal parenchyma demonstrates no overt or dominant mass, allowing for the limitations of this examination.
There is splenomegaly, also consistent with portal hypertension.
Within the limits of the examination, no nodules are seen within the liver, and no adenopathy is seen.
TTE [**2170-6-15**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear  structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is probable mild cardiomegaly, with an unfolded aorta.
There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, with some more confluent alveolar opacities at the bases.
Right and left costophrenic angles are excluded from the film, but no gross effusion is identified.
Old healed right-sided rib fractures noted.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 61 yo male with hx of mod etoh abuse presents to [**Hospital1 **] on [**5-31**] with diarrheal illness, hepatitis, altered mental status.
Found to also have elevated creatinine, ?
Transferred to the ICU on [**6-2**] after found to be lethargic and short of breath.
In ICU, pt started having coffee ground emesis.
He was electively intubated and EGD showed portal gastropathy and grade I varices.
# Resp failure/ARDS: Pt was intubated on [**6-2**] for EGD in setting of upper GI bleed.
Later that day, he was reintubated for resp distress not improved with BiPAP.
He was emergently bronched following intubation for suspected aspiration and 250cc of bilious fluid was suctioned out.
# Hepatitis/Liver failure: Probable EtOh hepatitis but hemochromatosis also on differential.
Pt was started on albumin and rifaxamin for hepatorenal syndrome.
Abd U/S showed ascites, however there was not enough fluid to tap.
Transplant team followed for the entire course of the hospitalization but continued to feel that he was not a transplant candidate given his persistant hypotension and fever with no clear source, despite broad antibiotic/antifungal coverage.
# GI Bleed: thought to be [**1-18**] esophagitis, has grade I varices but no overt signs of bleeding.
Then again, on [**6-19**], pt had a large amount of hematemesis and another variceal bleed was found.
# Elevated PTT: Pt found to have elevated PTT.
This is likely due to his liver disease.
# Bacteremia - e.coli bacteremia from [**6-2**] blood cx, sensitive to ceftriaxone for which he received a 14 day course (completed [**6-16**]).
# Fever: On [**6-21**], five days after completion of ceftriaxone, pt spiked a fever to 101.
Following his traumatic NGT placement concerning for an aspiration event, he was rebroadened to cefepime/flagyl and vanc.
Patient continued to spike fevers and no clear source of infection was found.
Due to his liver and renal failure, he was not a candidate for chemical cardioversion, and on [**6-17**], pt was electrically cardioverted with 200J.
Once he was off pressors, a trial of intermittent HD was attempted but pt became hypotensive to the 60s so CVVHD was reinitiated.
# Thrombocytopenia - Likely secondary to liver failure.
Patient was transfused platelets as necessary for procedures.
Given his refractory hypotension, requiring pressors and his persistant fever despite very broad coverage he was deemed not be a transplant candidate.
