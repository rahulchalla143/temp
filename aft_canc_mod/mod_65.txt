The patient initially was in the [**Hospital 5353**] Hospital ED on [**9-8**] with chest pain.
He was transfeed to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for a GIB and a HCT of 21.
From the medicine admission note: Pt states he has never had liver problems or h/o jaundice, but has taken about 14 tylenol over past week for chronic back pain.
Around the time he came back he developed chest pain and was seen in the [**Hospital3 **] ED where chest pain resolved with NG and he was discharged.
Pt is very unclear about this - states that he had an MI but was only given SL NG and was discharged without admission.
Since that time he developed melena and jaundice.
He denies dizziness or chest pain but in the [**Hospital3 **] ED he was found to have elevated LFTs, Hct of 22, received 1u PRBC and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED received 2u PRBC, octreotide and PPIs as well as KCL for hypokalemia, N-acetylcysteine for elevated tylenol levels, and antibiotics for bandemia.
RUQ showed gall baldder sludge but no bilary dilation.
He was felt to have no ascites and so was not tapped.

Other forms of liver disease including hepatitis and severe hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this examination.
Associated mild gallbladder wall edema is a non-specific finding which can be seen in low albumin states.
No definite evidence for cholecystitis.
The right  atrium is markedly dilated.
The left ventricular cavity  is mildly dilated.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include basal and mid  inferior and inferolateral akinesis..  3.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation  is seen.
4.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral  regurgitation is seen.
5.Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary  artery systolic hypertension.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
Markedly fatty liver containing a subcentimeter hypodense lesion that is too small to accurately characterize.
An additional focus of hyperdensity anteriorly within segment IV is incompletely characterized, and could represent a focus of fatty sparing.
No evidence of mesenteric vascular occlusion or secondary signs of mesenteric ischemia.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
[**9-21**] renal US: The right and left kidneys measure 12.8 and 13.2 cm respectively without evidence of stones, masses or hydronephrosis.
Patchy bilateral pulmonary opacities and dense bilateral lower lobe atelectasis and consolidation, findings that suggest infectious process superimposed upon atelectasis.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Interval increase in intraabdominal ascites.
No definite evidence of free intraperitoneal air.
Two foci of gas within the right lower quadrant are likely located within decompressed and non-opacified loops of small bowel.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Pt is a 50yo man with anemia, GI bleed, liver insufficiency, hyperbilirubinemia, bandemia, elevated troponin with new EKG changes, desaturation consistent with volume overload, alcohol abuse.
Blood loss Anemia and GI bleed- Likley [**12-25**] to GIB, acute on chronic since he was also anemic on [**9-8**] at [**Hospital1 392**].
GI preformed EGD which showed gastropathy and grade I varices, no active or h/o bleeding.
ABdominal CT scan revealed hyperdensity in the liver and fatty infiltration.
A colonoscopy showed a non-bleeding small polyp.
On presentation, he was jaundiced, had evidence of GI bleeding.
His liver failure was likely a result of alcoholic hepatitis.
RUQ US showed GB wall edema with sludge, no biliary obstruction, no ascites, some fatty infiltration of the liver.
CT scan (no contrast) of the abdomen showed ascites with an enlarged liver, with evidence of fatty infiltration.
Hepatitis serologies were negative for infection (Hep A, B, C).
Bilirubin improved slightly with these supportive measures, but this still remained very elevated.
After 5-6 weeks of supportive care, liver team felt that possibility of improvement was remote.
Neurology was consulted and felt that this was likely secondary to a toxic-metabolic cause.
MRI of the brain was performed and was negative for any focal lesion, enhancement, or other abnormality.
Mental status cleared; confusion was likely a result of hepatic and uremic encephalopathy.
ID:  Although initially afebrile on admission, he developed a WBC count and fever, bandemia.
Ascites was tapped and was negative for signs of infection/SBP.
CXR was suspicious for blossoming pneumonia.
CAD: On [**9-8**], he went to an outside hospital with chest pain, had an EKG with "nonspecific ST-T changes", and once his pain resolved he left the ED AMA.
Cardiology evaluated him and thought his current changes in the inferior lead was demand ischemia (in the setting of blood loss anemia).
An echocardiogram revealed a markedly dilated right atrium, 2+tr, moderate pulmonary hypertension, mildly dilated LV with basal, mid-inferior and inferolateral akinesis with 1+mr and EF 40%.
His atenolol and aspirin were held while he had a GI bleed.
This was most likely due to hepatorenal syndrome.
