MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Centered within the right cerebellum is a predominantly cystic 35 x 38 mm lesion with well-defined borders and a 8 x 20 mm enhancing mural component.
There is mild-to-moderate surrounding vasogenic edema which extends into the left cerebellar hemisphere and results in complete effacement of the fourth ventricle as well as mass effect on the adjacent medulla.
Mild dilatation is noted involving the third and lateral ventricular system with slightly increased FLAIR hyperintensity adjacent to the ventricular horns, which may relate to chronic small vessel disease or acute transependymal flow of CSF.
Additional scattered punctate subcortical white matter lesions are noted within the frontal lobes bilaterally, likely related to chronic small vessel disease.
There is no region of acute infarction, hemorrhage, or cerebral edema/enhancing lesions identified.
IMPRESSION:  Predominantly cystic lesion with enhancing rim/pseudocapsule as well as a large enhancing mural nodular component with mild-to-moderate surrounding vasogenic edema resulting in marked mass effect on the adjacent fourth ventricle as well as mild hydrocephalus.
Given the patient's history, a cystic metastatic lesion is felt most likely with the differential also including hemangioblastoma.

FINDINGS:  CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is a central catheter with its tip in the right atrium.
There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.
There is a large soft tissue mass that extends from the AP window to the right posterior infrahilar area and compresses the left pulmonary artery and bronchi to the subsegmental portions of the left lower lobe where there is some post-obstructive atelectasis (2, 34).
This necrotic soft tissue mass measures approximately 6.8 x 2.5 cm in AP and transverse dimensions.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Cystic changes upper lobe predominance suggests emphysema.
There is an area of possible pleural thickening versus pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe (series 2, image 19).
There is a 1.5 x 2.3 soft tissue mass in the apex of the left lung.
Post-surgical changes are seen in the left thorax posteriorly (2, 28).
While these could represent cysts or biliary hamartomas in this clinical context and with some of the cysts appearing of intermediate density (series 2, image 59) metastases needs to be considered.
The gallbladder is unremarkable excepting for a radiopaque gallstone.
The kidneys symmetrically take up and excrete contrast and there are multiple bilateral hypodensities.
There is no free air, free fluid or pathologic lymphadenopathy.
The abdominal vasculature demonstrates moderate atherosclerotic vascular calcification.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
There is no pelvic free air, free fluid or pathologic lymphadenopathy.
No suspicious osteolytic or osteoblastic lesion is seen.
Multilevel degenerative change is seen.
There is a sclerotic focus in the right iliac well marginated.
Extensive metastatic lung cancer with a soft tissue implant in the apex of the left lung, left upper paratracheal node, extensive left hilar mass causing compression of the left main pulmonary artery and subsegmental bronchi to the left lower lobe, right paratracheal conglomeration of necrotic nodes.
Multiple cystic and mixed-density lesions within the liver concerning for metastases in this patient.
Recommend MR for further characterization.
Multiple hepatic hypodensities.
Usually these are simple cysts but given this clinical context recommend evaluation at the time of abdominal MR.  4.
No suspicious osteolytic or osteoblastic lesion although, with the sclerotic focus seen in the right iliac, bone scan is recommended for further evaluation.
Cystic changes in the lungs suggest emphysema.
Likely bilateral staghorn calculi.
Consider non-contrast CT  COMMENT: These results were posted to the ED dashboard at the time of interpretation, 20 minutes after scanning    The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Provisional Findings Impression: JKPe TUE [**2131-5-15**] 6:10 PM Status post suboccipital craniectomy with cerebellar lesion excision.
The surgical cavity contains a large hematoma within it measuring 37 x 40 mm with persistent surrounding vasogenic edema and complete effacement of the fourth ventricle.
Additionally, there is an interval increase in the size of both the lateral and third ventricular system suggesting a slightly increased transependymal CSF flow likely reflective of increased intracranial pressure.
Final Report HISTORY: Status post suboccipital craniectomy for cerebellar mass lesion removal.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT  In the interval, the patient has underwent a right-sided suboccipital craniectomy with removal of the previously described predominantly cystic right cerebellar mass in this patient with known non-small cell lung cancer.
Large hematoma is noted to fill the surgical resection bed measuring approximately 37 x 40 mm and there is persistent vasogenic edema around the surgical bed resulting in complete effacement of the fourth ventricle.
Additionally, there is slightly increased size to the lateral ventricular system and a more ballooned appearance and dilatation of the third ventricle as well as the slightly increased low attenuation surrounding the ventricular system suggesting elevated intracranial pressure/ transependymal flow of CSF.
Expected pneumocephalus and subcutaneous emphysema is noted about the surgical site.
IMPRESSION:  Large hematoma within the surgical bed with persistent complete effacement of the fourth ventricle and surrounding vasogenic edema.
Interval increase in size of third and lateral ventricular system with suggestion of increased transependymal CSF flow.
No other changes.

FINDINGS: Since the previous MRI study, the patient has undergone right-sided suboccipital craniectomy.
Minimal enhancement is seen in the medial aspect of the surgical bed, which is not explained by pre-gadolinium blood products.
The surrounding edema is unchanged and there is continued deformity of the fourth ventricle.
Moderate ventriculomegaly with mild periventricular hyperintensities are again seen, unchanged.
New since the previous MRI is a signal change within the right basal ganglia extending to the periventricular region.
In correlation with the CT examinations, particularly that of [**2131-5-16**] it appears that the ventricular drain initially coursed down the right periventricular region through the basal ganglia and this could represent edema from that drain placement.
There is no evidence of low ADC in this region to indicate an acute infarct.
There is no midline shift seen.
Mild residual enhancement is seen at the medial aspect of the surgical bed.
The edema is unchanged and the ventricular size is also unchanged, which is moderately enlarged.
New signal change in the right basal ganglia could be explained from placement of the ventricular drain as this area was traversed by the drain on the CT of [**2131-5-16**].
This does not appear to be due to an acute infarct given the absence of ADC abnormality.
