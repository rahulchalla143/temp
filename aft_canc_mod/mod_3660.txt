He was in his usual state of health and had no complaints.
His CVL was flushed with 20 mL of NS prior to infusion but after his nurse tried to withdraw blood from the line his eyes rolled to the left side, he became extremely somnolent and was not able to move his left side.
He was taken emergently for CTA head which showed no focal abnormality of transit time or blood flow to suggest a focus of infarction/ischemia and no ICH.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he became acutely confused and would answer [**2085-2-4**], which is his birthday, to every question.
He can also say he is in pain but cannot say where the pain is located.

Pancolonic wall thickening and pericolonic fat stranding compatible with colitits.
New opacities in bilateral lungs may reflect developing infection.
MRI w/and w/out constrast head  [**2111-9-5**]:  Interval development of non-enhancing white matter abnormalities predominantly in the right parietal and occipital lobes.
Differential diagnosis would include venous ischemia versus encephalitis or vasculitis.
Sulcal FLAIR hyperintensity is also noted along the vertex of the brain .
There is slow flow in the left transverse sigmoid sinus.
Consider MRV to exclude the possibility of venous sinus thrombosis.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or obvious hypodense area to suggest an acute infarct.
However, if there is continued clinical concern given the symptoms and signs, consider MR of the head if not contraindicated.
Patent major arteries of the head and neck without focal flow-limiting stenosis or occlusion.
No acute infarction or mass effect.
These may represent tiny foci of gas, with accurate assessment of the attenuation value on the prior CT being limited due to volume averaging artifact.
Maxillary retention cysts .
ECHO: [**2111-8-31**] No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers .
MRI w/o contrast of Head [**2111-9-5**]: Interval development of non-enhancing white matter abnormalities predominantly in the right parietal and occipital lobes.
Differential diagnosis would include venous ischemia versus encephalitis or vasculitis.
Sulcal FLAIR hyperintensity is also noted along the vertex of the brain .
There is slow flow in the left transverse sigmoid sinus.
Consider MRV to exclude the possibility of venous sinus thrombosis.
Pancolonic wall thickening and pericolonic fat stranding compatible with colitits.
New opacities in bilateral lungs may reflect developing infection.
No fluid or hematoma around the PICC insertion site near the antecubital fossa.
Bilateral upper extremity ultrasound [**2111-9-24**]:No evidence of thrombus in the internal jugular and visualized portions of the subclavian veins.
This study is unable to completely rule out SVC syndrome.
Altered mental status: Mr. [**Known lastname 33419**] is a gentleman with small lymphocytic leukemia status post stem cell transplant on [**2111-5-1**] who had an episode of unresponsiveness and left sided hemiplegia at a routine clinic blood draw from his tunneled central line.
MRI and CT of his brain did not show evidence of infarct but raised question of air emboli in right parietal lobe which was thought to be the cause of the initial event.
His treatment course in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] included work-up for infectious and toxic causes of his acute mental status changes were all unremarkable.
Infectious diseases was consulted, an infectious encephalopathic picture was felt to be less likely, viral studies pending.
He was treated empirically with IVIG for BC/[**Male First Name (un) 2326**] and Foscarnet  briefly for herpes virus.
A 24 hour EEG demonstrated slow right sided sharp waves which may have served as epilogenic focus, but no seizures.
Repeat MRI imaging demonstrated white matter lesions in the right parietal and occipital lobes with slow flow through the left transverse sinus which were not visualized on the first MRI.
An MRA/MRV was suggested but not completed due to the requirement of medication to have the study completed.
His hallucinations of people, voices and events had resolved by HD 15. .
# Questionable Bacteremia: There was concern that Mr. [**Known lastname 33419**] suffered from bacteremia following manipulation of his tunneled line.
He was started on Vancomycin empirically given his prior history of MRSA infection.
The likely source was an infected right IJ catheter, which was removed on [**2111-9-17**] due to persistently positive cultures.
He remained afebrile and asymptomatic throughout.
# New pulmonary infiltrate on chest CT: A chest CT on HD 7 demonstrated new pulmonary infiltrates concerning for an aspiration event while Mr. [**Known lastname 33419**] was altered.
GI GVHD: Patient has a history of GI GVHD being treated with cyclosporine and prednisone.
He continued to have [**3-19**] loose bowel movements daily with mild LLQ abdominal pain on exam.
His cyclosporine dosing was decreased with concern for neurotoxicity.
Prednisone was concommitantly increased on admission but was slowly tapered as Mr. [**Known lastname 33419**] [**Last Name (Titles) 48752**] his baseline mental status.
PICC thrombus:  Patient received left PICC line on [**2111-9-19**] for parenteral antibiotics due to his bacteremia.
It thrombosed on [**2111-9-20**] with pain and swelling of the left upper extremity.
HTN: During his admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 33419**] was noted to have elevated blood pressures, with diastolic pressures over 100.
On HD 16, Mr. [**Known lastname 33419**] complained of bilateral pedal edema.
Of note several EKGs during his admission were significant for evidence of bigemy and trigemy, which was consistent with Mr. [**Known lastname 62232**] past medical history.
Upper extremity U/S demonstrated no evidence of SVC syndrome.
No upper extremity venous engorgement or Pembertons sign was noted on exam.
Graft versus host disease   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile, ambulatory.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 33419**],  You were initially admitted to the hospital because of confusion and a difficulty moving the right side of your body.
A CT scan and MRI of your brain did not show any signs of stroke, and we tested you for a possible infection of the brain which was also negative.
You unfortunately developed a blood infection from an infected catheter in your neck that we removed.
We also kept you on a higher dose of steroids in the hospital because of your worsening "GVH" disease.
