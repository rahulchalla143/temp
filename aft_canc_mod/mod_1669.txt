Over the course of the day on [**2128-3-9**] the patient felt increasingly fatigued and, in the evening, developed fever to 102F with chills.
He denies any cough but claims somewhat chronic mild nasal congestion with minimal post-nasal drip.
No dysuria or diarrhea.
He reports a dull frontal headache with mild photophobia but no neck stiffness or any focal neurologic symptoms.
No recent travel or sick contact.
[**Name (NI) **] influenza vaccination.
Review of Systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies recent weight loss or gain.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations, lower extremity edema.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezes.
Denies dysuria, stool or urine incontinence.
Denies rashes or skin breakdown.
The patient presented with three weeks of fatigue, sore throat, preauricular pain and two days of a headache on [**2127-10-9**].
He underwent a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy and pathology demonstrated acute myelogenous leukemia with myelomonocytic differentiation that was positive for the inversion 16 mutation.
His course was complicated by pulmonary edema during induction requiring ICU transfer, febrile neutropenia and respiratory bronchiolitis.
Cycle 1 was complicated by fever/neutropenia requiring admission.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - asthma - allergies - motor vehicle accident in [**2126-7-24**], in which he hit his head   Social History: Mr. [**Known lastname 27628**] is engaged and his fiancee just gave birth to a baby girl named [**Name (NI) 27631**] on [**1-16**].
Family History: His father died of kidney cancer in his 40s.
HEENT: EOMI, sclera anicteric, conjunctivae clear, OP moist and without lesions.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
SKIN: Small cut on left shin, no erythema or drainage.
NEURO: Oriented x 3, normal attention, CN II-XII intact, no nuchal rigidity PSYCH: Appropriate, pleasant.
HEENT: EOMI, sclera anicteric, conjunctivae clear, OP moist and without lesions.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
SKIN: No lesions or rash.
IMAGING: [**2128-3-10**] CXR: No acute intrathoracic process.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly to moderately depressed (LVEF=40-45%) with mild global hypokinesis (and inferior near akinesis).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2128-3-12**] Lower Extremity U/S: no DVT in either leg .
[**2128-3-12**] CT Chest w/o con: Widespread infiltrative pulmonary abnormality, infection and/or pulmonary hemorrhage.
Some component of edema is likely.
[**2128-3-12**] RUQ U/S: Mild gallbladder wall edema and sludge but no evidence of stones, pericholecystic fluid and the [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign is negative.
Therefore, acute cholecystitis is unlikely, however, clinical correlation is recommended.
Pulmonary vasculature is normal, although mediastinal veins are mildly distended.
There is no pleural effusion.
Given the appearance of the chest CT performed concurrently with the most recent prior chest radiograph, I do not believe this is pulmonary edema and favor atypical pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage instead.
Brief Hospital Course: 33 year old man with AML on day 16 of his fourth cycle of HiDAC who presented with neutropenic fever, found to have Strep viridans bacteremia and pneumonia.
# Neutropenic fever: Upon admission, CXR and UA were both negative and the patient denied any URI, GI, or meningeal symptoms.
He was noted to have a small cut on his left lower extremity which did not appear infected.
He continued to experience fevers to 104 and desaturation to the low 90s, so voriconazole and levofloxacin were added.
Blood cultures returned positive for Strep viridans (4/4 bottles), so antibiotics were changed to vanc/meropenem/vori.
A TTE showed depressed LVEF and RVEF compared to a prior study in [**9-/2127**], c/w a toxic/metabolic process.
He remained hypoxic, so LENI was done which showed no DVT.
CT chest showed a widespread pulmonary infiltrate suspicious for infection or pulmonary hemorrhage, as well as some component of pulmonary edema.
He was diuresed with good effect and his O2 requirement slowly declined.
The patient experienced diarrhea and was empirically started on PO vancomycin.
A PICC was placed and the patient was discharged home on vanc/meropenem for a total 7-day course for pneumonia (to be completed on [**3-22**]).
# Chest pain: The patient complained of mild chest pain during his ICU stay.
Troponins were initially slightly elevated, but the CK-MBs were flat and he did not have any EKG changes.
The pain resolved spontaneously and was felt to be due to his underlying pneumonia.
He was evaluated by ophthalmology which revealed a macular hemorrhage with multiple cotton wool spots in the right eye and multiple intraretinal hemorrhages in the left eye, likely from his underlying AML.
He was neutropenic upon admission and received several days of Neupogen while in the ICU, which was discontinued on the floor since he was no longer neutropenic.
3. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: One (1) puff Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Critical Care Systems  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Bacteremia - Pneumonia .
Secondary: - Acute myelogenous leukemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 27628**], You were admitted with fevers and were found to have an infection in your blood and lungs which we are treating with antibiotics.
You also reported blurry vision in your right eye.
