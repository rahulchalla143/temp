History of Present Illness: 57 y/o male w/ probable metastatic lung ca, met to L5 spine, who presents from OSH with leg weakness secondary to cauda equina syndrome.
He was admitted to [**Hospital **] hospital on [**2152-4-17**] with a 20 lb weight loss and long standing history of progressive low back pain, followed by leg weakness.
The low back pain has been an issue for the last 2-3 years, but over the last 2 months has become more severe and has radiated to his posterior thigh and calves.
He reports that he cannot stand due to pain rather than to weakness.
He denies loss of bowel or bladder function.
Neuro evaluation there on [**2152-4-17**] showed normal pin sensation of LEs, although there was subjective numbness of the feet.
No focal weakness of the extremity muscles was noted to manual testing and DTRs were noted to be 1+ and symmetric at knees, and absent at ankles.
Work-up showed a destructive lesion in L5 with a soft tissue component, likely representing metastatic disease.
There was also evidence of pathologic compression of the body of L5 and severe foraminal narrowing at L5-S1 with cauda equina compression.
He was also found to have a cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe of the lung measuring almost 1cm, suspicious for nonsmall cell lung cancer, likely squamous cell.
His pain improved after optimization of his pain regimen, however he became constipated.
Clinically the patient was not improving and still had significant leg weakness, and therefore it was recommended by the neurosurgeons to transfer him for consideration of cyberknife treatment.
Note dated [**2152-4-24**] reports patient can lift lower extremities bilaterally but cannot wiggle toes with slight foot drop on L.  On arrival today, patient reports pain in low back.
Complains of weakness and numbness of his lower extremities, which he reports has become worse over the last 2 days.
He reports constipation and abdominal distention, however he does admit to having a small BM yesterday.
He also admits though that he does have numbness in his buttocks and does not feel that he has full control over his bowel movements.
Denies upper extremity weakness or numbness.
also denies cough, sob, sputum production or hemoptysis.
low back pain, + left hip pain, lower extremity weakness, and numbness in toes.
Past Medical History: probable metastatic lung ca (9mm lesion RUL) h/o low back pain hepatitis C h/o ETOH   Social History: smokes [**12-22**] pack cigarettes per day.

no m/r/g abd- soft, distended, tympanic to persussion, w/o tenderness to palpation, rebound or guarding.
no pain ellicitid w/ knee flexion/extention.
Sensation largely intact to pinprick and light touch with exception of decreased sensation in large toes b/l (L>R) and reported decreased sensation in buttocks area, however felt examiner easily on rectal exam.
unable to elicit anal wink on rectal exam, with decreased rectal tone.
unable to ellicit L patella reflex, with R patella reflex 1 + .
On discharge: 102.8, 99.8, 101, 96/57, 27, 100 Trach mask Alert and Oriented He is able to fully move UE - has no LE motor function Tracheostomy in proper position without surrounding erythema or exudate Tachycardia but regular rhythm Coarse breath sounds bilateral lungs with R>L Abdomen is flat and nondistended.
He has a midline wound that is granulating in nicely.
LE as mentioned no motor function.
No edema   Pertinent Results: Reports- MRI [**2152-4-18**]- Mild pathologic compression fx of L5.
Tumor has destroyed posterior cortex of the vertebral body and causes critical spinal stenosis at this level with critical compression of the cauda equina.
Severe bilateral foraminal narrowing at L5-S1 and moderate bilateral foraminal narrowing at L4-L5.
Ct guided bone bx [**2152-4-21**]- pending at time of transfer  [**2152-4-22**] KUB no intestinal obstruction or other acute intr-abdominal abnormality.
lytic metastatic dx involving left side body L5.
[**2152-4-19**] Bone scan- probable mild to moderate generalized peripheral arthritic changes as described above.
Otherwise negative for significant focal skeletal lesion in the rest of the whole body.
Negative for significant focal skeletal lesion in the thoracolumbar vertebrae.
[**2152-4-20**]- MRI brain- no evidence of intracranial metastasis.
Trace chronic paranasal sinus disease.
[**2152-4-18**]- CT chest- Cavity lesion right upper lung, 9mm.
Right hilar adenopathy.
small non-calcified nodule left upper lung posteriorly.
no extra or intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Multifocal ground-glass opacity and consolidation superimposed upon diffuse centrilobular emphysema.
The most likely cause for these findings includes ARDS or multifocal pneumonia.
Small pneumoperitoneum.
Increase in size of the patient's right upper lobe cavitary lesion as noted.
Decreased prominence of bilateral patchy airspace opacities previously noted.
Persistent airspace opacities seen within the right lung with debris in the right mainstem bronchus as noted.
Significant distention of numerous loops of small bowel.
The diffuse nature of this distention suggests a functional ileus.
No area of transition is seen to suggest a mechanical small-bowel obstruction.
Free fluid seen within the peritoneal cavity.
[**2152-5-10**] CXR (most recent) REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Assess cardiopulmonary process HISTORY: Ventilator-dependent failure with right cavitary lesion.
Again there is a large left upper lung cavity.
The atelectatic change at the left base has essentially cleared.
.6, Glc 100  LFTs: [**2152-5-5**] AST 13, ALT 20, Alk Phos 64, Amylase 109*, T. bili 4.6*  CEA 2.1 PSA 1.1   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 57 y/o male w/ probable metastatic lung ca, met to L5 spine, who presents from OSH with leg weakness secondary to cauda equina syndrome - will resulting colonic perforation.
Neuro: He was admitted for workup and treatment of his symptomatic spine lesion.
He was to be operated on but was found to have perforated bowel.
He was never operated on and his symptoms of cauda equina persisted.
CV: Patient was in sinus tachycardia throughout the hospitalization.
He has a large right lung abscess that was assessed by the thoracics team.
Any intervention would not likely improve survival  GI: abdominal distention/constipation- KUB [**4-22**] w/o evidence of obstruction.
On the operating table for spine surgery he was found to have abdominal distension and a portable xray was done which showed air under the diaphragm.
His urine output has been adequate  Endo: He was on a RISS  ID:  He was covered broadly for his lung abscess and post operative prophylaxis.
Fluconazole was started for yeast in Urine and Sputum.
FEN: has had hyponatremia - we have had him KVO and are trying to fluid restrict him.
