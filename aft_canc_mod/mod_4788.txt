Large, probably loculated right pleural effusion and smaller volume of pleural air, projecting through the intercostal plane into the submuscular right chest wall, probably facilitated by separated surgical rib fractures.
Diffuse narrowing, right bronchial tree distal to the main bronchus, not due to hematoma.
Moderately severe atelectasis, right lung, probably due to a combination of bronchial narrowing and restriction by thickened pleura and pleural effusion.
No right pleural drain is seen currently.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis, right greater than left, are stable.
A small right apical air collection is stable without evidence of tension.
Subcutaneous air in the right chest wall is again noted.
