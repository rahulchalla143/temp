Patient was initially admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with respiratory distress, thought to be secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
Course at [**Location (un) 620**] was complicated by UTI with administration of CTX.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical evaluation for her aortic stenosis and possible balloon aortic valvuloplasty.
Initially patient responded to 20mgIV lasix (received a total of 40mg IV) however again became tachypneic and less responsive so discussion was made to transfer to the CCU for initiation of BiPAP.

The aortic valve was then crossed with a 0.014 straight wire and a pigtail catheter was placed in the left ventricle for simultaneous pressure recordings.
A 0.035 Amplatz SuperStiff guidewire was placed in the left ventricle and a single balloon inflation was performed using a 18 mm Tyshak II balloon.
Immediately after balloon deflation, the patient developed marked hypotension.
There was no evidence of aortic regurgitation and no evidence of pericardial fluid.

# PUMP: Patient with known critical AS and transferred to CCU for monitoring of heart failure symptoms prior to valvuloplasty.
She was on bipap briefly and then given lasix IV prn for diuresis.
Unfortunately immediately after balloon deflation, the patient developed marked hypotension.
Per cath report there was no evidence of aortic regurgitation and no evidence of pericardial fluid.
