He had a second episode of hemoptysis on [**2172-11-20**] and presented to OSH ED.
Because the pt had several episodes of hemoptysis (and one in the ED) the pt was admitted for bronchoscopy.
On [**2172-11-20**] the pt was taken for bronchoscopy which was unable to be performed due to difficulties with sedation, and a significant amount of periglottic edema.
The pt was then taken to the OR for bronchoscopy under genearal anesthesia and endotracheal intubation, and during the procedure a fresh clot was visualized in the left lingula, which, when gently disturbed, produced brisk bleeding.

Mildly confused but oriented.
Aortogram and left bronchial arteriogram demonstrating the anatomy.
Left bronchial arteriogram demonstrated active contrast extravasation from both superior and inferior branches.
No spinal arterial contribution was noted from either branch of the left bronchial artery.
Post embolization arteriogram showed satisfactory angiographic result.
CT head [**12-6**]: No acute intracranial pathology.
At the left, some small areas of retrocardiac atelectasis persist.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.

Active Issues:  # Hemoptysis:  PE ruled out on CTA at OSH.
Evidence of bleeding on bronch after two evaluations thought [**1-14**] AVM.
Pt is s/p IR embolization of left bronchial artery without hemopytysis since the [**11-23**].
# Respiratory distress/MRSA VAP: Patient transferred intubated because of hemoptysis.
Concern for multifocal pneumonia on CT.
Scopalamine patch trialed on [**11-30**] for copious oral secretions, but this was ineffective.
Two days after extubation, there was no evidence of withdrawal but still had mild confusion with confabulation.
# elevated INR: Likely in setting of poor nutrition, improved to 1.3 on discharge.
Transitional Care: 1) Anemia/Thrombocytosis: recheck CBC as outpt 2) Elevated Lipase: No clinical signs of pancreatits but at risk bc of alcohol, if abd pain develops consider CT abd/pel 3) Elevated ALT: Likely chronic from ETOH vs NASH, consider w/u as outpatient  Medications on Admission: Propofol gtt Fentanyl gtt Protonix 40 IV daily MVI daily Thiamine 100mg daily Senna 1 tab [**Hospital1 **] Artificial tears   Discharge Medications: 1.
