No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %).
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic valve abscess is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild to moderate ([**1-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetation, or pacemaker associated mass or vegetation visualized.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mildly depressed left ventricular systolic function.
Limited evaluation demonstrating nodular hepatic contour with increased heterogeneous hepatic echogenicity, suggestive of cirrhosis.
Patent hepatic vasculature without evaluation of the right posterior portal vein due to patient body habitus and overlying gas.
Evaluation of the hepatic arteries was also suboptimal due to patient difficulty breath-holding.
There was minimal erythema at the distal antrum.
Brief Hospital Course: Brief Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 19122**] is a 78F with PMH of cardiomyopathy (EF 45% per OSH records), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, questionable liver cirrhosis, recent ERCP [**2179-1-29**] with sphincterotomy given CBD, discharged on [**2179-1-31**], who was transferred for Hct drop and dark stools.
She was admitted to the ICU for EGD and monitoring.
EGD showed post-sphincterotomy bleed, which was injected with epi.
She had no recurrent bleeding.
# Anemia/GIB:  She had acute GI bleeding on account of a post sphincterotomy bleed.
She had no further bleeding after injection of the sphincterotomy site with epinephrine.
In discussion with her outpatient providers, we learned that she had been admitted to [**Hospital3 3765**] in [**2178**] with a hematocrit of 20 with guaiaic positive stool.
Given that she had no recurrent bleeding, and that no additional potential bleeding site was identified, she was advised to resume coumadin with lovenox bridge at home on the night of discharge.
Cirrhosis:  u/s showed nodular liver suggestive of cirrhosis, but no mention of portal hypertension on that exam.
# Chronic congestive heart failure EF at OSH 45% per report.
On discharge, patient has no rales on exam.
# LE edema:  Patient with marked hyperpigmentation, suggestive of venous stasis.
She does have 1+ pitting edema on discharge with a pressure blister over her left shin.
LE edema likely from venous stasis and prednisone use as her lungs are clear.
# Hypothyroidism: most recent TSH elevated at 15.66, free T4 1.11.
Continued Levothyroxine 150 mcg daily, and will need repeat TFT's with outpatient PCP  # Hypertension:  Bp meds held during admission b/c of initial hypotension and GI bleed.
# Asthma exacerbation:  Patient had acute development of wheezing while hospitalized.
Medications on Admission: - amiodarone 200mg daily - Lovenox 70mcg q12hr - Levothyroxine 125mcg daily - Omeprazole 20mg [**Hospital1 **] - Pravastatin 20mg qhs - Warfarin 2mg daily - ASA 81mg daily - Ativan 1mg po qhs prn insomnia   Discharge Medications: 1. amiodarone 200 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
8. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
9. furosemide 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: take as needed for leg swelling, or as otherwise specified by your primary care doctor.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] home care  Discharge Diagnosis: Post sphincterotomy bleed Asthma exacerbation Chronic systolic heart failure Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had a procedure called an ERCP and were found to have blood loss at the site of the sphincterotomy which you had recently had.
You also had bacteria in your blood.
There were no infectious growths on your heart valve as a consequence of having bacteria in your blood.
Subsequent blood cultures showed that the bacteria had been cleared from your blood with this treatment.
You had a worsening of your asthma when you were here and required a few days of prednisone and breathing treatments.
You were also seen by our gastroenterology team in evaluation of anemia (low blood count) that your doctors [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] were evaluating.
You developed some swelling in your legs and a blister in your legs.
