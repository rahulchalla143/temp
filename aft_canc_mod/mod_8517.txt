Admission Date:  [**2107-6-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-7-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2034-2-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Shellfish / Carboplatin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1556**] Chief Complaint:   weight loss & unable to take POs.
Biopsy of peritoneal implant.
Repair of incisional hernia with mesh.
Female w/ stage IIIc papillary serous ovarian cancer s/p  Paclitaxel, 6 cycles of Carboplatin/Gemcitabine, on cycle 6 of Doxorubicin, h.o.
SBO w/ necrotic ileum s/p ileostomy, multiple abdominal surgery who is being admitted directly from clinic due to concern about her rapid weight loss and inability to eat.
Her CT scan at that time showed SBO with a transition point within the left pelvis, extensive adhesions and decrease in mesentery deposits compatible with treatment response.
She has continued to have emesis despite restriction to a full liquid diet.
She had a rapid 20 lb weight loss since her previous discharge and has only been able to tolerate water for the past few days.
She reports that she feels nauseated after eating any food or fluid and generally vomits a half an hour or so after eating.
She denies having any abdominal pain.
Review of Systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezes.
No recent change in bladder habits.
Pulm: No dullness to percussion, CTAB no crackles or wheezes Abd: high pitched bowel sounds.
Extremities: wwp, no edema.
Skin: no rashes or bruising Neuro/Psych: CNs II-XII grossly intact, MAE.
Dilated small bowel proximally with a probable transition point in the pelvis and relatively decompressed distal small bowel and colon, compatible with small bowel obstruction.
No evidence of perforation.
New areas of hypodensity in the left hepatic lobe may represent focal fat deposition, although metastatic disease cannot be fully excluded.
Dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels and distal decompressed loops of small bowel with transition region noted within the midline pelvis in region of newly created small bowel anastomosis.
This is concerning for small-bowel obstruction but appears similar to prior exams and should be correlated with clinical picture.
Large thin-rim-enhancing fluid collection within the midline central pelvis extending into the lower abdomen near new anastomotic site.
Underlying abscess is not excluded.
Interval increase in right pleural effusion with new left pleural effusion.
Small amount of new intra-abdominal ascites.
Status post repair of ventral hernia.
Overall decrease in size of multiple loculations of right lower quadrant abdominal fluid collection.
An anteriorly located collection is not contiguous with these loculations and is slightly increased in size.
Persistent bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right, small on the left.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Small hiatal hernia.
Interval decrease in thin rim-enhancing fluid collection within the midline central pelvis extending into the lower abdomen near the enteroenteric anastomotic site.
Interval removal of drain within the fluid collection immediately adjacent to the anastomotic site and superior to the bladder.
Anteriorly located fluid collection does not appear contiguous with these loculations and is stable in size and appearance compared to [**2107-7-12**].
Dilated loops of proximal small bowel with distal decompressed loops of small bowel with transition point noted within the midline pelvis within the region of the small bowel anastomosis.
Findings are concerning for partial small bowel obstruction, however, appears similar to prior examinations and may represent chronic dilated small bowel.
Interval decrease in right-sided pleural effusion with resolution of left pleural effusion.
Adjacent compressive atelectasis within the right lung base.
Unchanged bilateral adrenal nodules, previously characterized as adenomas     Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 73 year ole female with stage IIIc papillary serous ovarian cancer s/p Paclitaxel, 6 cycles of Carboplatin/Gemcitabine, on cycle 6 of Doxorubicin; h/o SBO with necrotic ileum s/p ileostomy, multiple abdominal surgeries who was admitted for rapid weight loss and inability to eat in the setting of chronic SBO seen on CT scan one month prior to admission when the plan was conservative management with slow advancement of diet.
Also, an incisional hernia was repaired with a veritas bioprosthetic mesh.
The operation proceeded without complication and she was transferred to the floor after a short stay in the PACU.
On POD 4, her right arm was noted to be edematous and there was increased resistance in flushing the PICC.
Right upper extremity duplex was consistent with thrombotic occlusion of right brachial vein and right axillary vein.
While Ms. [**Known lastname 103423**] overall status appeared to be improving, she complained of new lower abdominal pain on POD 8.
CT scan showed a pelvic fluid collection and on POD 9, a pigtail catheter was placed by IR to drain the fluid yielded 210 cc of brownish, cream-colored serosanguinous fluid.
She was started on cipro/flagyl therapy, was briefly switched to zosyn for monotherapy, then switched back to ciprofloxacin after fluid cultures grew e. coli sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
On POD 15 a repeat CT scan showed another fluid collection and a small collection near the midline mesh.
A second pigtail catheter was placed, draining 15 cc of fluid and 25 cc of fluid was aspirated from the midline mesh area.
She was placed on calorie counts, given protein supplements and continued on a regular diet which she tolerated well in small amounts.
She had a repeat CT scan on [**2107-7-19**] to assess the fluid collections which had markedly decreased.
There was scant drainage from the tubes and they were removed on [**2107-7-16**] and [**2107-7-20**] respectively without difficulty.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain not controlled by acetaminophen.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for anxiety, nausea.
Stage IIIc papillary serous ovarian cancer 4.
