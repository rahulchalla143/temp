No shift of normally midline structures.
Note is made of anterior temporal branch of MCA arising from M1.
No anterograde flow is seen from right MCA bifurcation.
Distally, sylvian branches are filled, probably due to collateral circulation.
On perfusion mapping, note is made of slight decrease in perfusion in posterior temporal lobe on the right.
Multiplanar reformation images confirm the above finding.
IMPRESSION: Occlusion of proximal M2 segment of the right MCA at bifurcation, without evidence of anterograde flow.
No evidence of infarction visible on non-contrast CT within brain parenchyma, however, there is slight perfusion decrease in right posterior temporal lobe.
EKG: Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response.
CXR: UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Heart is mildly enlarged.
There are no focal consolidations, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Mild cardiomegaly.
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
[**4-3**] MRI:  FINDINGS - BRAIN MRI:  The diffusion images demonstrate slow diffusion in the right frontal lobe and subinsular region and the right temporal lobe consistent with acute infarct in the distribution of right middle cerebral artery.
There is moderate brain atrophy seen.
No evidence of midline shift, mass effect, or hydrocephalus identified.
No evidence of acute or chronic blood products seen.
Susceptibility images demonstrate an area of low signal in the region of bifurcation of the right middle cerebral artery suggestive for a thrombus.
IMPRESSION: Acute right middle cerebral artery territorial infarct involving the frontal, temporal, and subinsular regions of the right cerebral hemisphere.
Probable thrombus in the bifurcation region of right middle cerebral artery.
No acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
MRA OF THE HEAD:  The head MRA demonstrates narrowing of the flow signal in the lateral portion of the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery with diminished flow signal in the sylvian branches of right middle cerebral artery consistent with a thrombus in the middle cerebral artery.
Compared to the prior CTA, there appears to be some increased flow within the region of the right MCA bifurcation.
However, there is persistent decreased flow signal in sylvian branches of the right middle cerebral artery secondary to thrombus in the MCA.
No other abnormalities on the MRA of the head.
EEG:   FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: There is intermittent right frontal central slowing in the 2 Hz delta frequency range.
ABNORMALITY #2: The background is slow in the 7 Hz theta frequency range and those in the entire right hemisphere was mildly disorganized and shows some increased voltage gradient.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG obtained in wakefulness progressing to drowsiness due to the presence of intermittent right frontal central slowing in the delta frequency range and slow and mildly over the right hemisphere disorganized background rhythm.
This abnormality suggests deep, midline subcortical dysfunction consistent with a mild encephalopathy.
The first abnormality is suggestive of subcortical dysfunction over the right frontal temporal region.
There were no clear epileptiform abnormalities recorded.
There was an irregular heart beat noted.
ECHO:  Conclusions: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
No intracardiac thrombus seen.The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism identified.
GI BX 1 DISTAL ESOPHAGUS: Distal esophagus, mucosa, biopsy:  Squamous epithelium with mild active esophagitis.
EGD FINDINGS [**4-5**]: -Small hiatal hernia, displacing Z-line to 37 cm from incisors, with narrowing at 40 cm from the incisors -Grade 4 esophagitis with spontaneous bleeding in the middle third of the esophagus, lower third of the esophagus and GE jxn.
Bx taken (above) -Evidence of previous partial gastrectomy with Bilroth II seen -Diffuse erythema and congestion of the mucosa of the stomach with no bleeding -Single 4 mm nonbleeding nodule at the GJ anastomosis site -Gastric PH was 5 - low - raises question of retained antrum syndrome -Rec: [**Hospital1 **] PPI, Carafate 1 g qid -Normal duodenum   Brief Hospital Course: This is a 79 year old man with atrial fibrillation and history of GI bleeds in the past, who had presented with slurred speech and left arm weakness, who was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] and received TPA at 3 hours after onset of symptoms (11AM) following CTA that revealed occlusion or tight stenosis of right MCA approximately at the bifurcation.
Also noted on CTA were enhancement of peripheral small vessels, likley to be collaterals, and on perfusion mapping, note was is made of slight decrease in perfusion in posterior temporal lobe on the right.
He was admitted to the ICU following TPA for close monitoring; blood pressure autoregulated and after 24 hours, aspirin was recommended, which he refused given his GI bleed history (including a large GI bleed following aspirin use).
His exam continued to improve, and at discharge, he had mild dysarthria and subtle left finger extensor weakness alone.
As coumadin had also caused GI bleeding in the past, GI was consulted for further management considering this history of bleeding, and with the question of whether aspirin would be better or worse than coumadin with regards to GI bleed risk.
He was transfused for a drop in HCT, and underwent endoscopy, which revealed gastritis and esophagitis (see "results" section), with low gastric PH, raising the possibility of retained antrum syndrome following a Billroth II operation.
[**Hospital1 **] PPI and QID carafate were recommended, and GI felt that part of his history of GI bleeds related to medication noncompliance with protective and acid-reducing medications.
The risks and benefits of the medications were explained to the patient, an in the end, with equivalent risk profiles and coumadin providing better protection from another cardioembolic event considering his embolic infarct and atrial fibrillation, coumadin was started after protein C and S panels were sent (results of which were pending at discharge, but appear to be normal).
He was advised of the importance of continuing his GI medications.
He was set up with the [**Company 191**] coumadin clinic to follow his INR on this medication, with the goal INR being the narrow range of [**1-15**].5 in order to protect him as much as possible from both GI bleed and stroke.
)(s)* Refills:*2*  -Flomax, B12 and folate should be restarted as an outpatient  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Cerebral Infarction - R MCA   Discharge Condition: good - exam with left facial droop, very mild left hand extensor weakness, and mild dysarthria.
Discharge Instructions: Please [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD or return to ED if you experience new sx suggestive of stroke.
