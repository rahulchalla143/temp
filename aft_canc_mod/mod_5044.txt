Mr. [**Known lastname **] was recently admitted on the BMT service from [**9-6**] to [**9-10**] with a fever and a new morbilliform rash.
No infectious source for his fevers was identified (chest CT was done as well as urine/blood cx NGTD; CMV VL is still pending).
He defervesced and was discharged home after being afebrile x 24 hous.
The evening of discharge he developed low-grade fever at home, but then spiked to over 102 overnight.
He reports that his rash has not significantly changed and possibly is less confluent now.
He has had 4 loose watery non-bloody BMs with some abdominal cramping prior to BMs.
He felt weak and tired with fevers, but had no other symtpoms.
Specifically, no abdominal pain.
Zosyn then d/c'd but then restarted on [**9-15**] for fever to 101.4.
On day of transfer, pt actuely desat'd to mid 80's but recovered with supplimental oxygen.
CTA of chest done showed bilateral ground glass opacities.
He was urgently transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for intubation and resp failure.
- s/p ABVD x4 cycles with good response, then ABVD x2 with poor response.
- s/p CEP x2 with poor response.
- s/p auto-SCT with Cytoxan [**9-/2145**], with persistent adenopathy and PET +.
- s/p mini-matched unrelated donor (MUD) allo transplant [**2146-6-27**] with evidence of disease progression on CT  - s/p Gemcitabine [**2146-7-21**], last treatment [**8-11**]  - s/p DLI [**2146-8-25**].
His maternal grandmother with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer and paternal cousin has pancreatic cancer.
Physical Exam: Vitals: 99.6, HR 113, 88/44, RR 21-23, AAC 100%, 400 x 20, PEEP 5 Gen: tired ill appearing young man in acute distress HEENT: pt on [**Name2 (NI) 597**] Pulm: CTAB.
w/ distant BS, no wheezes CV: regular, nl S1S2, no m/r/g.
Neuro: AAOx3, no focal neuro deficits on gross exam.
Skin: diffuse erythematous rash confluent on chest and back, + blanching, with discrete macules and papules on extremities, abdomen, behind ears.
When compared to the prior day's examination, there appears to be improvement in the minimal patchy increased density at the left base likely due to improvement of some subsegmental atelectasis.
There is patchy increased density in the right base, which is new and which may represent minimal airspaces and/or atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 30 yo male with h/o refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p reduced intensity non-myeloablative MUD allo transplant who was admitted with GVHD rash and diarrhea who was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with hypoxic respiratory failure.
1)Respiratory Failure: The cause of Mr. [**Known lastname 63572**] respiratory failure was thought to be secondary to the Bleomycin, which he had received as part of his chemotherapy regimen in the past.
Cxray suggested diffuse atelectasis in addition to basilar opacities.
No source of infection was identified; all cultures were negative.
Pt was made CMO once discussions with the BMT and [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] team suggested that he had a poor prognosis.
2) LUE DVT: Pt with spontaneous L subclavian, brachial, and axillary non-occlusive DVT and unchanged small LLL filling defect on chest CTA.
D/w BMT team, who agreed that given this pt's high risk of bleeding, will not treat DVT at this point with anticoagulation.
Stool cultures were negative for c.diff and overlying infectious etiology.
5) Thrombocytopenia: Likely secondary to his underlying and refractory malignancy.
Likely secondary to GVHD and possibility of red-man syndrome secondary to Vancomycin.
CT [**9-8**] showed some regression of tumors.
He was also placed on PPI for GI regimen.
