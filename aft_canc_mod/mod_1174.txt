2 days prior to admission, she reports that she felt well and had been afebrile but then progressively became more confused w/ increased tenderness near her port site.
Since admission, she was found to have elevated lactate levels, and port site noted to have purulent drainage.
Fem line was placed as pt has difficult access.
She defervesced quickly, and has remained afebrile for 24hrs.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Peripheral vascular disease with bilateral carotid stenoses status post TIA.
In [**8-/2103**], the patient had left upper extremity weakness and slurred speech with complete resolution in less than 24 hours.
Coronary artery disease (1 vessel).
The first cardiac cath in [**8-/2103**] showed total occlusion of right coronary artery.
However, there were significant left-to-right collaterals.
Second cardiac cath in [**12/2107**] showed  no progression of her coronary artery disease.
Status post undisplaced pathological fracture of her right pelvis, both inferior and superior rami in 09/[**2107**].
Metastatic sarcomatoid kidney cancer.
Family History: One brother died at a young age probably secondary to Addison disease.
Two brothers have coronary artery disease.
There is no history of osteoporosis in her family.
general: ill-appearing, pleasant, uncomfortable secondary to pain HEENT: PERLLA, EOMI, anicteric, posterior skull with multiple raised areas, no sinus tenderness, MMdry , op without lesions, no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, no jvd, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules lungs: crackles bilaterally chest: kyphosis, tenderness at former port-a-cath site--site is erythematous, warm and tender heart: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated abdomen: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly extremities: no cyanosis, clubbing or edema skin/nails: chest skin as above--otherwise no rashes or lesions.
EKG: NSR at 75, nl axis, nl intervals, no st changes.
Radiologic: CXR: INDICATION: Addison's disease and metastatic sarcomatoid kidney cancer, now with fever.
FINDINGS: There is a new right central line, the tip overlying the distal SVC.
No pneumothorax is seen.
There are bilateral linear interstitial markings consistent with CHF on a background of emphysema.
Left upper lung mass is partially obscured by the scapular shadow, but persists.
ECHO [**2108-5-4**]: EF 60-65%, 1+ MR, mod pulm artery HTN, no valvular vegetations.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 74 year-old woman with metastatic sarcamatoid kidney cancer, Addison's disease, admitted with fever and hypotension likely from port infection.
# GPC/MSSA sepsis: Port is likely source of infxn given purulence when it was examined in ED; was improving initially after starting on vancomycin.
TTE to eval for vegetation in setting of gram positive sepsis was negative; TEE was performed also confirming no endocarditis.
She remains afebrile, with port site without erythema, induration or drainage.
# Elevated WBC ct, persistent during admission: No clear source.
TEE was negative for valvular lesions.
# Hypotension, resolved: At baseline, BP fluctuates given hx of Addison's.
However, considered other etiologies for hypotension - sepsis, adrenal insufficiency (s/p IV steroids tapered to po prednisone), cardiogenic given cad history (unlikely), hypovolemia/bleeding - hematocrit drop likely secondary to fluids.
# Addison's: Was receiving hydrocort in ICU; transitioned to PO steroids.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline Cr near 1.5; may have had failure from prerenal etiology.
restarted ACEI as she is hypertensive and renal fxn back to baseline.
# Anemia/ thrombocytopenia: likely secondary to chronic disease, renal disease, chemotherapy.
# Pain: both at port-a-cath site and due to bone mets; on tylenol #3 at home, pain is now well controlled with Tylenol III's.
# DNR/DNI .
