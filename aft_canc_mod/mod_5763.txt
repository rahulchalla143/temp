HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old female with history of hypertension, diabetes type 2, and diverticulosis by colonoscopy in [**7-10**], who presents with large volume of BRBPR x2 this a.m.
She has never had prior GI bleeding and denied chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, palpitations, recent fevers and chills, recent NSAID use, GERD, anticoagulation, ETOH.
Diverticulosis with no history of GI bleed (colonoscopy, [**7-10**], showing diverticula of sigmoid and descending colon and grade 1 internal hemorrhoids, otherwise normal to cecum).
Seborrheic keratosis.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location 96323**] with husband (who is currently hospitalized in Rehab Center with CVA), no tobacco or ETOH.
Neck:  Supple, no JVD, no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2; no murmurs, rubs, or gallop.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema, 2 plus PT pulses.
On [**2140-5-16**], ECG, normal sinus rhythm at 79 beats per minute, normal axis and intervals, left atrial enlargement, frequent PACs, no ST-T wave changes from prior ECG.
Patient was typed and crossed for several units of packed red cells and was ensured adequate peripheral IV access and given normal saline for volume resuscitation.
Over the course of the evening, she had several more episodes of hematochezia while attempting to prep for colonoscopy for the following day.
She was monitored in the MICU for the next several days and transfused several units of packed red cells for continually decreasing hematocrit.
She had a colonoscopy on [**2140-5-17**] showing extensive diverticulosis in the entire colon, though more concentrated in the left colon, and fresh blood in the rectosigmoid colon to about 50 cm from the anal verge, but most concentrated from about 40 to 50 cm and no bleeding proximally.
While fresh blood was continually seen, no specific bleeding diverticulum was identified.
She stabilized over the next few days and continued on IV Protonix, though the most likely source of bleeding was from the sigmoid or descending colon, secondary to diverticulosis.
However, we discussed with the patient that these episodes were likely to recur and should they recur surgery may be indicated in the future.
The patient will not need to continue PPI at home as unlikely to have upper GI lesions.
