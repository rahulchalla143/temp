He recently presented to his PCP complaining of weight loss and was referred for repeat colonoscopy [**10-16**] which was was incomplete due to luminal narrowing.
Report read that "Patient has severe narrowing and sense of external compression with hard to navigate left colon."
EGD performed at the same time as the colonoscopy showed a reducible small size hiatal hernia , Grade II ESOPHAGITIS with no bleeding, mild gastritis, Abnormal mucosa with contact bleeding was noted throughout the duodenum, A single sessile 10mm non-bleeding polyp of benign appearance was found in the proximal bulb.
Virtual Colonoscopy on the same day was performed and showed a 4 cm annular lesion in the mid transverse colon with local lymphadenopathy, multiple abdominal and pelvic metastatic deposits, and a large amount of intra-abdominal pelvic ascites, likely malignant.
Of note in [**4-6**], for positive occult blood, he had colonoscopy which showed a single hyperplastic polyp.
EGD showed duodenal polyp- biopsy consistent with chronic inflammation.
He initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for complaint of rectal bleeding on [**10-19**].
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] lavage was negative with bilious return.
MICU course notable for: - Aggressive volume resusitation with 7UPRBC and Hct increased from 15 to 28 - Corrected coagulopathy with 2U FFP - Started on iv PPI - Aflutter in the setting of volume depletion (since resolved) - He was made DNR/DNI and discussions were made regarding hospice care - Pt initially hypotensive iwth SBP in 70s but improved with blood transfusions.
Unclear if due to hypovolemic or cardiogenic shock as troponin elevated and pt went into rapid aflutter.

The mass caused a partial obstruction.
Excavated Lesions Multiple severe non-bleeding diverticula with mixed openings were seen in the sigmoid colon.
Impression: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon Mass in the transverse colon, partially obstructing mass Recommendations: Follow-up biopsy results Follow HCT.
Serum Hpylori pending   Brief Hospital Course: In summary, a 71 yo M w/ h/o CAD s/p CABG '[**14**], chronic type A aortic dissection, probable colon cancer recently diagnosed, and sz disorder admitted with GIB in setting of known colon mass but also w/ h/o abnormal duodenal mucosa s/p duodenal polypectomy.
Had initially been considered too unstable for EGD/flex sig to look for bleeding source.
He had an episode of malanotic stool on the evening of [**10-25**] at 9pm and EGD [**10-26**] showed non-bleeding broad based ulcer.
GI thinks that melena [**10-25**] could have been residual blood from that ulcer which has now heeled.
We recommend that his Hct continued to be monitored as an outpatient by his PCP/oncology given likely ongoing slow bleed from GI malignancy.
# Malignancy.
Likely metastatic colon cancer.
CEA is not elevated and LDH is elevated, but has h/o large B cell lymphoma that was treated, unlikely cause of GI mass.
# Shock: Initially admitted to the MICU in shock.
His beta blockers and ace inhibitors wer held due to hypotension.
# Tachycardia: Has history of PAF s/p CV.
Went into rapid Afibin the  setting of shock which improved with fluid resusciation.
# Systolic CHF; (EF 35%).
His home furosemide was held due to initial hypotension.
TEDs stockings were placed due to lower extremity edema and he was diuresed with iv furosemide.
His aspirin was held due to the GI bleed and the betablocker and ac inhibtotor were held due to blood pressures in the low 90s-100.
# Coagulopathy:  He was noted to have an elevated INR but normal platelets and PTT.
Consistent with vitamin K deficiency, felt likely due to poor po intake.
#  ARF: Initially admitted with elevated Creatiine that improved with volume resuscitation.
# CAD s/p CABG '[**14**]: Troponin was initially increased but CK/MB normal.
# PPX: PPI, pneumoboots .
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO every twelve (12) hours as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
