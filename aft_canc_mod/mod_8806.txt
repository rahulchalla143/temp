The patient received a screening colonscopy 5 days ago ([**2155-2-26**]) at [**Hospital3 **] which resulted in the resection and retrieval of 4 polyps and evidence of diverticulosis.
A subsequent colonscopy on [**2155-2-28**] was unsatisfactory, and thus the patient was admitted to the wards for observation, where he exhibited a persistently downtrending Hct from [**Date range (1) 100834**] (42 -> 34.9 -> 33.8 -> 27.7) and expressed significant abdominal discomfort, dizziness and orthostatic hypotension.
Given these continuing symptoms and decreasing Hct, a technetium bleeding scan was performed on [**2155-3-3**] which revealed extravasation at hepatic flexure, and the patient was subsequently transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU.
He reports fatigue, light-headedness and abdominal cramping.

Sub-4-mm bilateral lower lobe pulmonary nodules.
Layering hyperdensity within the cecum adjacent to the ileocecal valve, which could be consistent with hemorrhage in this area.
No active extravasation is identified throughout the abdomen and pelvis.
Left adrenal adenoma.
Variant hepatic arterial anatomy with a replaced left hepatic artery arising from the left gastric.

[**2155-3-8**] Colonoscopy Polyp in the ascending colon Diverticulosis of the sigmoid and descending colon Tattooing and scarring seen at the site of the former polypectomy at the hepatic flexure 3 clips seen in the rectum, no active bleeding Cecal ulcer with vessel at the site of former polypectomy (endoclip, endoclip) Linear areas of superficial bleeding in the cecum consistent with barotrauma Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum  Brief Hospital Course: 67 y/o M with AVR on Coumadin, diverticulosis, and past history of ulcers and pyloroplasty who presented from [**Hospital3 **] with a downtrending hematocrit and evidence of GI bleeding.
Given his history and recent colonoscopy, there was concern for persistent bleeding from a retracted polyp at hepatic flexure or from rectal tears.
Ultimately, the decision was made to stop anti-coagulation to allow the bleeding to stop on its own, which all teams involved expected.
On [**3-8**] the patient had a colonoscopy which showed a polyp in the ascending colon, Diverticulosis of the sigmoid and descending colon, Tattooing and scarring seen at the site of the former polypectomy at the hepatic flexure 3 clips seen in the rectum, no active bleeding, Cecal ulcer with vessel at the site of former polypectomy (endoclip, endoclip).
Linear areas of superficial bleeding in the cecum consistent with barotrauma, Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum.
On [**3-7**] a presumptive idenitification of > 100,000 CFU/mL of E. coli was identified.
Leukocytosis: Patient presented with WBC of 16.6 with a left shift of 88% PMNs.
Patient had no infectious symptoms on presentation and this was attributed to a stress response and resolved by day 3 of admission.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Sub-4-mm bilateral lower lobe pulmonary nodules.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Lower GI Bleed Colonic polyp in ascending colon Small pulmonary nodules  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 100833**],  You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] for a lower gastrointestinal bleed after you had polypectomies performed.
You were initially admitted to the intensive care unit and given blood until your blood counts stabilized.
Our GI doctors also performed a colonscopy which did not show any significant active bleeding that required further intervention.
