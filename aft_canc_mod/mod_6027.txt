Admission Date:  [**2160-11-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-12-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2091-12-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / ibuprofen  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Transfer for respiratory failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intra-abdmonial abscess drainage  History of Present Illness: 68 yo male with history of PE, recurrent bowel obstructions, a fib who was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for worsening respiratory distress.
Pt initially presented to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1459**] Hospital on [**2160-11-6**] for elective abdominal wall reconstruction and lysis of adhesions given multiple recurrences of bowel obstructions.
On [**2160-11-11**], pt developed respiratory distress.
CXR showed possible LLL pneumonia.
Pt initially improved, however on [**11-16**] pt had episode of tachycardia to 130-140s associated wtih increased respiratory distress.
Given worsening renal status, pt was evaluated with V/Q scan which again showed no evidence of PE.
The following day, CT abdomen showed ilieus with no bowel obstruction and LLL pneumonia.
Sputum cultures returned positive on [**11-18**] for Klebsiella and the patient was noted to be febrile.
Repeat CT scan did not show e/o abscess or other intra-abdominal source.
On morning of [**11-25**], pt was intubated for worsening respiratory failure.
Past Medical History: - [**Month/Year (2) **] in the past requiring ex-lap - Colonic resection in past (unclear if related to [**Name (NI) **]) - [**Name (NI) **] SBOs; 3 in past year - H/o PE now s/p IVC filter - A Fib not on coumadin - COPD - HTN - HL - OCD and depression - H/o alcohol abuse   Social History: Past history of alcoholism, quit 35 years ago.
Rhoncorous breath sounds throughout CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, large staple line in midline.
GU: Foley in place Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: Sedated  On Discharge: General: Lying in bed in NAD HEENT :PERRLA, Sclera anicteric Lungs: Still rhoncorous but improved.
No major change since yesterday.
GU: Foley in place Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: Awake, alert and oriented.
ECHO [**11-26**] - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Rim enhancing, air-containing fluid collection in the lower abdomen / upper pelvis.
Although this collection was present on [**11-24**], the rim enhancement and gas are new and concerning for abscess.
Despite proximity to old small bowel anastamosis, no extravasation or oral contrast.
Two smaller rim-enhancing collections below the liver and in the pelvis are not suitable for drainage.
Common bile duct dilation with a smooth taper towards the pancreatic head.
Differential enhancement of the pancreatic head and punctate calcifications are consistent with sequela prior acute or chronic pancreatitis.
Persistent pneumonia with improved aeration of the left lower lobe.
Extensive paranasal sinus disease is likely secondary to both chronic sinusitis and patient's recent intubation.
While there is no definite evidence of acute sinusitis, this diagnosis cannot be excluded.
Complete obstruction of the left maxillary sinus.
Collapse of the right lower quadrant abdominal collection with a sliver of remaining fluid and drainage catheter located within.
Unchanged appearance to tiny pelvic and subhepatic fluid collections.
Slightly improved multifocal ground glass opacities likely reflect infectious process with improved aeration in left lower lobe.
Hypodensities in the pancreatic head could reflect prominent side branches, and if indicated can be assessed by MRI.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Prominent main pulmonary artery, again suggesting underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Multifocal consolidative and ground-glass opacities, demonstrating variable progression and improvement compared to [**2160-12-5**], as detailed above.
These remain most consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
Coronary artery calcifications.
Trace pleural effusions.
Slight interval reexpansion of a right lower quadrant fluid collection.
Decreased subhepatic and perirectal fluid collections.
Mildly improved bilateral bibasilar multifocal opacities compatible with a resolving pneumonia.
Small left pleural effusion increased since [**12-9**], [**2160**].
Bilateral renal cysts, stable.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 49985**] is a 68 year-old man transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with pneumonia and worsening respiratory failure s/p intubation.
Hospital Course ----------- The patient was admitted at [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1459**] Hospital from [**2160-11-6**] until [**2160-11-26**], initially for an elective surgery and subsequently for a worsening pneumonia.
Sputum cultures there were ploymicrobial including klebsiella/yeast/MRSA implicating aspiration as a possible etiology.
Sputum cultures revealed MRSA and corynebacterium.
A CT torso was performed that showed an organizing intra-abdominal abscess with communication to the bowel.
The patient went for IR drainage of the communicating abscess.
Surgery saw the patient regarding the communication with the bowel and felt this was a low output fistula and declined intervention.
Radiographically his pneumonia was improving as well.
On [**12-10**], the patient had a likely aspiration event causing a transient desat and leukocytosis.
On [**12-11**] the patient underwent repeat abdominal CT scan that showed a small interval increase in size of the perihepatic collection and a decrease in size in other collection.
Anemia - The patient had a baseline hematocrit and [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) 1459**] of ~35.
No obvious bleeding source and hemolysis labs were negative.
Urinary retenetion - The patient reports having a history of urinary retention for which he sees a urologist.
Atrial Fibrillation - The patient has a history of afib fow which he is rhythym controlled with amiodarone.
He is not an AC at baseline most likely due to a low CHADS2 score.
COPD - The patient has a history of COPD.
Unclear baseline PFTs or oxygen saturation.
HTN - Held his home lisinopril in the setting of severe infection.
Bipolar d/o - Initially held all psychoactive medication including seroquel, amytriptiline, and welbutrin.
4) Reccomend CT abd/pelvis to evaluate for itnerval change in fluid collections after completing antibiotic course on [**2160-12-26**] 5) Speach and swallow evaluation.
Has been on tube feeds while in the ICU due to aspiration event.
Recent contrast exposure.
3. white petrolatum-mineral oil 56.8-42.5 % Ointment Sig: One (1) Appl Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dry eyes.
