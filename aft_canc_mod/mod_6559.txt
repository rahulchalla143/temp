Multiple seizures with significant QRS widening and ECG changes.
A brief description of her problems according to problem is described below: .
# TCA overdose.
Fit clinical scenario with CNS depression, widened QRS, seizure, hypotension initially at OSH.
# Respiratory failure.
Later in the setting of intensive vent requirements was found to have a MRSA pneumonia as well, which was treated with IV vancomycin.
After extubation she had one day of marked stridor that resolved with decadron and racemic epinephrin.
Her sputum cultures reflect MRSA colonization not infection as she is without symptoms, fever or elevated WBC.
# Seizure: Most likely from TCA overdose and GABA receptor antagonist activity.
No prior history of seizures known.
She was started on propofol gtt and and TCA overdose was treated.
She was prescribed benzodiazepines for breakthrough seizures.
No seizures since.
At times she showed symptoms of delirium without a clear organic cause.
Her affect seems pleasant and she currently states that she does not have suicidal ideation.
# Pancreatitis: Patient was found to have elevated lipase and amylase [**12-27**] in the setting of low-grade fevers and leukocytosis, most likely due to prolonged sedation with propofol.
She improved clinically with no abdominal pain, was advanced to regular diet with no problems.
# Hypokalemia: associated with TCA overdose treatment and movement of K across cell membrane.
# Wide complex tachycardia.
Precordial negative concordance and axis change most suspicious for VT.  Also consider sinus tach with QRS widening from TCAs.
She was monitored on continuous telemetry, which was eventually discontinued as there were no further events.
# Combined respiratory/metabolic alkalosis with superimposed metabolic acidosis due to TCAs and lactate: She had regular ABG and electrolytes measured for monitoring.
# Thrombocytosis: Pt was noted to have elevated platelet count.
Given recent pneumonia and pancreatitis, likely reactive thrombocytosis.
# Volume overload: Pt was estimated to be volume overloaded up to 17L total during her stay in the ICU due to the large amount of fat emulsion solution that was used to treat TCA overdose.
