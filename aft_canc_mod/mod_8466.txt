CXR [**2200-11-2**] FINDINGS: Right internal jugular vascular catheter has been repositioned, now terminating in the mid superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax.
Persistent right lower lobe scarring versus atelectasis adjacent to surgical chain sutures as well as a small right pleural effusion versus pleural thickening.
No new or worsening lung or pleural abnormalities.
ECG [**2200-11-2**] Sinus tachycardia, rate 107 with frequent ventricular premature beats.
There is moderate baseline artifact.
Left atrial abnormality.

Brain, right craniotomy: Necrosis and changes consistent with radiation changes.
Brain, right craniotomy: Necrosis and changes consistent with radiation changes.
Right frontal enhancing mass from tumor/radiation necrosis at the resection site with associated significant perilesional edema/ radiation induced changes.
There is extensive perilesional FLAIR and T2 hyperintensity surrounding this mass.
There is mild decrease in enhancement as compared to the previous MRIS with no change in the perilesional hyperintensity.
This mass is likely to represent radiation induced necrosis rather than residual/ recurrent neoplasm.
For surgical planning.
No evidence of new enhancing lesion.
