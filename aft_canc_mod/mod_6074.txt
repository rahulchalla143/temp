Admission Date:  [**2115-10-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2115-11-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2040-5-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: indomethacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**] Chief Complaint: Right sided weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None this hospitalization   History of Present Illness: 75M with recently diagnosed metastatic esophageal cancer, presented to the ED this morning after experiencing sudden right sided weakness.
He was diagnosed with metastatic esophageal cancer while vacationing in [**Country **] earlier this month.
While brushing his teeth this morning, he felt suddenly weak in his right arm and unable to hold the toothbrush.
Neurology noted mild R hand weakness.
CT noted a perfusion defect.
Guaiac positive stools so neurology recommended starting heparin, no tPA.
Also found to have a PE on neck CTA.
On the floor, he complains only of abdominal pain, which has been increasing for the previous few weeks.
He endorses early satiety and poor appetite, along with a 15lb weight loss over the last couple weeks.
He has noticed some shortness of breath and chest tightness that began during his flight to [**Country **] and has been intermittent.
Past Medical History: 1) Esophageal cancer (The patient was diagnosed esophageal adenocarcinoma in [**Country 1073**].
[**Location (un) 2274**] provider ordered CTA of abdomen and pelvis which showed a mass with and planned to biopsy [**10-28**]) 2) Oral cancer treated with XRT at [**Hospital1 2025**] in [**2083**] 3) Macular degeneration / b/l cataracts 4) Migraine aura without HA 5) Hypothyroidism 6) Labyrinthitis   Social History: Lives in the [**Hospital1 1426**] area alone.
VS: 122/64 75 18 95% on 4L GEN: cachectic and pale, fatigued HEENT: Sclera anicteric, dry mucus membranes NECK: supple, JVP to halfway up neck, no lymphadenopathy LUNGS: CTA b/l, no wheezes, good inspiratory effort CV: RRR no m/r/g ABD: soft, non-tender, non-distended, +BS, no masses palpable EXT: no edema, arm vitiligo SKIN: warm and dry, pale NEURO: CN 2-12 grossly intact, strength 4/5 in right arm and extensors, [**5-16**] right flexors and left arm, [**5-16**] bilateral legs, 3+ reflexes equal bilaterally  Pertinent Results: American Hospital in [**Country **], Endoscopy Report: Large mass in the distal esophagus and gastric cardia.
IMAGING: [**2115-10-28**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST - No acute intracranial process.
[**2115-10-28**] CT BRAIN PERFUSION - Acute ischemia in a small territory of the superior division of the left MCA with increased mean transit time but no significant abnormality of blood volume; this represents a significant "ischemic penumbra."
Acute pulmonary embolism in the right upper lobar pulmonary artery branches, incompletely imaged.
[**2115-10-28**] MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAS - Small acute infarct in the left precentral gyrus.
Possible punctate acute infarct in the right occipital lobe.
Acute infarcts in bilateral cerebral hemispheres would suggest central embolic etiology.
No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease.
This finding is most consistent with a patent foramen ovale.
Aspiration of pooled contents with nectar thick and thin liquids.
[**2115-10-30**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST - No acute intracranial process, with known embolic infarcts not identified.
Left-sided PICC line.
Unchanged mild pulmonary edema.
Unchanged left pleural effusion with left basal and retrocardiac atelectasis.
[**2115-11-6**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - In comparison with the study of [**11-3**], there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary edema.
Opacification at the left base is consistent with effusion and atelectasis.
[**2115-11-6**] 09:37PM BLOOD Lactate-1.5  Brief Hospital Course: 75M with a PMH significant for recently diagnosed metastataic esophageal carcinoma, HTN, hypothyroidism who presented with acute respiratory failure found to have left ischemic stroke with incidental pulmonary embolus undergoing heparinization complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring MICU transfer due to presumed aspiration PNA .
PLAN: # METASTATIC ESOPHAGEAL CARCINOMA - Originally diagnosed in [**Country **] at the American Hospital with evidence of metastatic disease based on reports provided, although no tissue was provided.
The patient's staging work-up was completed in [**Country **] - with CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis, EGD showing a distal obstructing mass extending to the gastric cardia region, and a colonoscopy which was reassuring.
This admission, the patient initially had a GI evaluation for possible repeat endoscopy with biopsy, but this idea was aborted given the decision to transition to hospice without further oncologic intervention.
It was noted that even if he obtained a feeding tube and underwent rehabilitation, his clinical status would likely not be optimal to pursue systemic chemotherapy or radiation.
In the transition to hospice, the patient's pain was controlled with liquid/PO Dilaudid, and Lorazepam liquid PO for anxiety regarding his condition.
ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA - There was a concern for an aspiration event this admission given his hypoxemic respiratory failure (from secretions, was NPO at the time).
A video swallow evaluation showed marked pooling within the valleculae with delayed hypopharyngeal transit.
Aspiration of pooled contents with nectar thick and thin liquids was noted.
A CXR showed pleural effusion with left basal and retrocardiac atelectasis, with concern for aspiration.
This event occurred on the medicine floor and required MICU transfer given acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring supplementation oxygenation without intubation.
He was treated with 8-days of Vancomycin and Zosyn for aspiration pneumonia coverage.
He was also given IV Lasix given evidence of volume overload, to which he responded well with increased urine output.
# ENTEROCOCCUS UTI - The patient was without symptoms of dysuria or urinary frequency or urgency but given concern for sepsis in the setting of an underlying malignancy, his urine studies revealed an Enterococcus UTI, which was treated with 7-days of IV Vancomycin.
A Foley catheter was also maintained given his history of hypotonic bladder.
# NUTRITIONAL CONCERNS - Speech and swallow performed a video swallow evaluation showing recurrent aspiration attributed to history of throat radiation from prior H&N malignancy.
# CVA/STROKE AND PATENT FORAMEN OVALE - The patient initially presented with concerns of right sided weakness, found to have a left precentral gyrus ischemic infarct and the right occipital lobe was involved, per MR imaging of the brain.
He endured some residual right hand weakness from the CVA/stroke.
Given low ischemic infarct risk, a 2D-Echo confirmed the suspicion of a patent foramen ovale with showering emboli from VTE phenomenon; increased given his malignancy status.
There were no further deteriorations in his neurologic exam.
# PULMONARY EMBOLUS - Acute pulmonary embolism in the right upper lobar pulmonary artery branches was noted on brain perfusion study performed for his ischemic stroke event.
Given his underlying malignancy, this was not an unlikely finding.
He was therefore anticoagulated with a continuous heparin infusion for both the pulmonary embolus, but also his ischemic stroke issues.
# HYPOTHYROIDISM - He was continued on Synthroid 75 mcg IV dosing given his NPO status (home dose Levothyroxine 150 mg PO daily).
# HYPERLIPIDEMIA - We continued his home dose of Simvastatin 40 mg PO daily.
