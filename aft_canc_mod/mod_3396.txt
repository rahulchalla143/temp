Admission Date:  [**2118-3-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-4-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2050-10-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**] Chief Complaint: Fatigue, decreased PO intake  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar puncture   History of Present Illness: 67 yo male, h/o stage IIIB IgG kappa MM s/p recent hospitalization for stem cell mobilization with high dose cytoxan (in preparation for autologous stem cell transplantation), who originally presented from home with malaise and fevers.
No diarrhea/vomiting/abdominal pain.
No headache/neck stiffness/urinary symptoms/difficulty breathing.
In the ED, SBP was 90-100s (responded to fluids), and he was slightly tachycardic with temperature to 99.6.
He is admitted for decreased mental status and febrile neutropenia.
When he arrived to the floor he was found to have decreased mental status which was concerning in the setting of severe hyponatremia and low WBC.
While in the ICU, he continued to receive NS IV fluids as well as stress dose steroids (Dexamethasone).
A cortisol stim test was done showed somewhat decreased cortisol elevation (2-->15).
The patient's mental status seemed to be more clear by [**3-19**], but on [**3-20**] still with mild encephalopathy which may be related to steroid psychosis.

MRI head FINDINGS: There is a large infiltrating enhancing mass centered in the right clivus and petrous bone, involving the right cavernous sinus, engulfing, displacing, and potentially obliterating the right cavernous carotid artery.
There is enhancing, thickened dura extending from this mass, and correlation with the prior CT demonstrates hyperostosis of the right aspect of the clivus.
No other enhancing lesions are appreciated within the brain parenchyma, nor focal signal abnormalities involving the remainder of the osseous structures.
Small calcified dural thickening vs. a calcified meningioma involving the superior falx.
Additionally, there is a small acute right convexity subdural hematoma, which appears new compared to the prior CT of [**2118-3-18**].
There is no restricted diffusion or susceptibility artifact to indicate acute infarction or hemorrhage.
IMPRESSION: 1) Large infiltrating mass centered in the right clivus/petrous bone with contiguous thickened and enhancing dura, engulfing and potentially obliterating the right cavernous carotid artery.
Despite the history of pituitary tumor resection, imaging findings are not typical for tumor recurrence or post-surgical change.
2) Small, but acute right convexity subdural hematoma, new from the CT of [**2118-3-18**].
.... MRA head: IMPRESSION: 1) Diminutive right proximal ICA, with complete loss of signal in the cavernous portion, suggesting either occlusion or very slow flow.
There is reconstitution of very faint flow in the supraclinoid portion with diminutive flow seen in the right MCA, right PCOM, and right ophthalmic arteries.
2) Known right skull base mass not well evaluated on this study, see prior discussion from the MRI brain and CT sella/orbit.
..... CT head with thin cuts through clivus: IMPRESSION: 1) Soft tissue mass, better delineated on the prior MRI, centered adjacent to the right cavernous sinus causes extensive hyperostosis of the petrous apex, body of the sphenoid bone, and right aspect of the clivus, suggestive of a meningioma, though see differential diagnosis provided on the prior MRI.
As stated in prior MRI, the right cavernous carotid artery is likely either displaced or occluded which could be further evaluated by dedicated MRA or CTA.
2) Known small right frontal convexity subdural hematoma, not well visualized on today's CT.  Brief Hospital Course: Assessment/Plan: 67 yo M with stage IIIA IgG kappa multiple myeloma with decreased mental status, hyponatremia and febrile neutropenia admitted originally to ICU now with improvement in MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] of counts.
# Mental status changes: Admitted initially with hyponatremia and febrile neutropenia.
[**Month (only) 116**] have had initial AMS secondary to hyponatremia as well as delirium secondary to infection.
However element of mental status changes seem to be a result of low cortisol as patient improved with the administration of hydrocortisone.
CT head showed tiny subdural hematoma thought to be non-contributory per Neurosurgery.
LP initially done did not show signs of viral infection.
Was briefly in ICU for AMS and was started on Acyclovir that was discontinued.
# Subdural hematoma/clivus mass: Hematoma thought to not be clinically significant (except to preclude anticoagulation).
However mass very significant as it is likely the cause of the electrolyte and other endocrine abnormalities as it is in the pituitary region.
Mass is not resectable as it is obstructive of the right carotid and other right cerebral vessels.
# Hyponatremia- Improved with NS IVF Likely secondary to a combination of both hypovolemia and endocrinopathies.
# Multiple Myeloma: He is s/p Stem cell mobilization with high dose Cytoxan the collection occurred on [**3-22**].
# Diabetes: The patient has a history of adult onset diabetes previously controlled with diet which has been exacerbated by Decadron administration.
Patient had small requirements for insulin sliding scale at discharge.
# Anemia: Thought to be secondary to patient's multiple myeloma.
# h/o Pituitary Microadenoma/Endocrinology: Patient is s/p transphenoidal resection of the pituitary gland and s/p post-resection radiation therapy.
He had a cortisol stimulation test which showed adrenal insufficiency.
Patient will be discharged on prednisone 5mg PO BID with instructions to call doctor with any illness for stress dose steroids.
# Vertebral fractures: no pain currently.
# FEN: very low phosphate, calcium and sodium.
