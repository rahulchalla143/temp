She regained this mental mental capacity about 30 minutes later.
An MRI of her brain was performed, which was negative for acute pathology, including metastatic disease or stroke.
On [**5-2**], the patient had a brief episode of afib with HR in the 160s.
She also complained of mild chest pain.

Moderate brain atrophy noted with dilatation of the ventricles and prominence of sulci.
There are periventricular hyperintensities identified predominantly in the frontal lobes.
There are chronic lacunes visualized in bilateral basal ganglia region.
There is no midline shift or hydrocephalus.
Increased signal in the pons and the midbrain appears to be due to changes of small vessel disease.
Soft tissue changes are seen in the sphenoid and right maxillary sinuses.
Following gadolinium no abnormal parenchymal, vascular, or meningeal enhancement identified.
IMPRESSION: Somewhat motion-limited post-gadolinium images.
No definite enhancing brain lesions are seen.
No acute infarcts.
Small vessel disease and brain atrophy.
