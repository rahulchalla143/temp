At the OSH, she had a CT head that showed a large posterior fossa cerebellar hemorrhage with surrounding edema and herniation.

CT Head: FINDINGS: A large parenchymal hemorrhage extends from the cerebellar vermis superiorly via the midbrain to involve the thalami bilaterally.
There is surrounding edema relating to both the supra- and infratentorial components of the hemorrhage, and perhaps slightly more extensive than was noted on the prior study within the right thalamic region.
There is a large amount of intraventricular blood in the lateral ventricles, opacifying the third and fourth ventricles, and extending through the foramina of Luschka bilaterally.
Obliteration of the quadrigeminal plate cistern is consistent with upward transtentorial herniation.
In addition, there is mild tonsillar herniation into the foramen magnum.
Vascular calcifications involve the internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
There are no concerning osseous lesions.
Large cerebellar vermian region hemorrhage extending superiorly to the level of the thalami, with a large amount of intraventricular blood and hydrocephalus.
The quantity of intracranial hemorrhage is similar to the prior study.
Parenchymal edema surrounding the hemorrhage has increased slightly from the prior study- see above report regarding this latter finding.
Upward transtentorial herniation and tonsillar herniation through the foramen magnum.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 yo F with complex past medical history, admitted after being found with obtunded with agonal breathing overnight, found to have a large intracranial hemorrhage with evidence of herniation.
# ICH: Imaging as above, ED exam concerning for no cornea, no gag, no withdrawl to pain, decerbrate on L arm, extensor in extremities, pupils nonreactive.
