Per patients wife and confirmed with the patient, the pt started experiencing decreased appetitie, headaches, mild confusion and lightheadedness on Sunday night [**2119-11-5**].
That night the pt became more disoriented with 3-5 episodes of yellowish emesis.
No neck stiffness.
No recent travel or sick contacts.
Review of symptoms was positive for occasional blood on his stool without frank melena or without gross hematochezia.
Also the pt complained of mild burning with urination.
Otherwise no abdominal pain, constipation, melena, chest pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, cough, urinary, dysuria, lightheadedness, no focal weakness, no vision changes, no skin changes.
Treated with FCR X 3 and is without evidence of recurrence since [**2116**].
-Hodgkin lymphoma: diagnosed in [**4-6**] after presenting in [**2-4**] with high fever and syncope.
Complicated by paraneoplasic neuropathy manifested as dysphagia requiring G-tube placement  -s/p 6 cycles of ABVD - most recent scans ([**8-7**]) no significant evidence of adenopathy, small bilateral pulmonary nodules that were tiny, and ill-defined etiology and modest splenomegaly.
- ([**8-7**]) Bone Marrow BX: No evidence of CLL or Hodgkin's disease.
- Hx of anal fissure,(followed by surgery) - Basal cell carcinoma of the skin - Perianal Warts (Anal Brushing confirming HPV) - Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (I.D.)
and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (Surgery) - chronic complaint of his G-tube bothering him, - Held bleomycin setting of decrease DLCO.
Married, not working, Denies Tobacco/Etoh  Family History: Non-Contributory  Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 98.6 BP: 114/72 HR: 85 RR: 16 O2Sat: 98% GEN: Thin appearing, speaking slightly slowly but fluently, no acute distress HEENT: NCAT, PERRL, EOMI, Oropharynx Clear for erythema or lesions.
Sclera anicteric, no epistaxis or rhinorrhea, MMM.
NECK: Neck Veins flat, No cervical, submental or submandibular appreciable lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: S1S2 No MRG PULM: R basilar crackles.
Lungs otherwise CTAB, no W/R/R ABD: Soft, NT, ND, +BS, slightly erythematous and tenderness at site of prior PEG.
No HSM, No masses.
No gait disturbance.
No cerebellar dysfunction.
No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
RECTAL: Positive Perianal Warts without frank erythema or tenderness, no DRE was performed.
Examination of cytospin preparation reveals collection of histiocytes, suggestive of granulomata along with increased eosinophils.
Spinal fluid [**11-12**] NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
============ Radiology ============ CT Head [**11-8**] No hemorrhage or fracture.
Concerning for infection (e.g.
Bilateral periventricular subependymal enhancing foci with associated white matter abnormalities.
Additionally, there is also questionable enhancement along the right internal auditory canal, raising the possibility of leptomeningeal spread.
The possibility of opportunistic infection is unlikely given the the pattern of white matter abnormality.
New areas of enhancement are seen in the right medial temporal lobe and along the right sylvian fissure.
Multiple periventricular enhancing lesions are again noted.
Given the rapid progression of the changes, infection is favored over neoplastic lesion.
Stable postoperative appearance following a right frontal lobe biopsy, without evidence for intracranial hemorrhage.
CT Head [**11-14**] Interval effacement of the cerebral sulci, which could be related to debris deposited in the leptomeninges likely infectious in nature.
Emergent neurosurgical consult is recommended for possible ventriculostomy to reduce intracranial pressure.
No immediate surgical complications detected.
Persistent appearance of loss of sulci and high-density material in the basal cisterns.
This finding is extremely worrisome for severe progression of meningitis.
============ Neurology ============ EEG [**11-10**] IMPRESSION: Abnormal routine EEG due to the presence of a slow background.
These findings suggest a widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.
Medications,  metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
Hypoxia is another possible explanation.
Nevertheless, there were no areas of prominent focal slowing although encephalopathies can obscure focal findings.
There were no clearly epileptiform features.
Brief Hospital Course: 66M hx of CLL with subsequent evidence of Hodgkin's Lymphoma that p/w low grade fever, headache and mild confusion likely communicating hydrocephalus.
Plan: # Eosinophilic Meningitis: The patient presented subtle mental status changes.
Given his change in mental status a non-contast CT was performed (details above).
Given evidence a non-communicated hydrocephalus, an LP was performed (details above) that has an opening pressure of 22cm on H20 and revealed an eosinophilic meningitis.
The pt underwent EEG revealing a toxic encephalopathy.
Tuesday Morning the pt was unresponsive but withdrawing to pain early in the AM.
The pt was found to be in Sinus Bradycardia, had minimally responsive pupils, and bilateral upgoing toes.
Subsequent CT scan demonsrated interval noncommunicating hydrocephalus with effacement of the sulci.
CSF was again consistent with eosinophilic meningitis.
Given the patient's rapid decline, there was also concern for infectious etiology.
Patient failed apnea test on [**11-15**].
# NHL: No current evidence for residual disaese per recent PET-CT, but given presentation there was some concern for CNS disease (see above).
# hx of CLL: No evidence of residual disaese: .
# Anal Fissures: No evidence on exam for infection.
