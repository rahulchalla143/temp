She presented to the Emergency Room on [**2152-10-3**], with altered mental status, decreased p.o.
intake, confusion and headache over several weeks, and was found to have three mass lesions in her brain on head CT.
In the Emergency Room she became hypertensive and was sent to the SICU.
The patient was also noted to have cellulitis on her left knee and was initially maintained on Vancomycin and later changed to Keflex.
During her Intensive Care Unit stay, the patient had increased alertness and was more oriented, although she does have a history of baseline dementia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Metastatic melanoma status post resection in [**2138**] with recurrence in [**2146**] status post treatment with Taxol.
History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with anticoagulation in the past.
Status post PCM for sinoatrial dysfunction.
History of coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2143**].
Peptic ulcer disease.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Dry mucous membranes.
There was poor dentition.
There was an early systolic ejection murmur, 3 out of 6.
Extremities:  There were bilateral skin eschars.
The left knee had excoriation and was erythematous.
She had a limited neurologic exam.
Right lower extremity with decreased strength, apparently chronic secondary to polio.
Electrocardiogram was paced, lateral T-wave inversion, inferior T-wave inversion which new consistent with [**2152-6-23**].
Head CT showed three moderately large-sized mass lesions in the right posterior frontal, right anterior frontal lobe and left parietal lesion with significant edema.
There was a small amount of peripheral density, question of hemorrhage or calcification.
Chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly, atelectasis, but no overt failure.
Knee films showed no fracture and no dislocation and degenerative changes with small right knee effusion.
Altered mental status:  This was felt to be secondary to metastatic disease to the brain.
The patient's blood pressures were maintained in the 140s to 160s systolic, and it was decided that this was an appropriate range given that the patient needed to have adequate perfusion in the face of increased intracranial pressure.
The patient did not develop any rash or other complications Keflex.
Her cellulitis was improved by the time of discharge.
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction, and her electrocardiogram remained stable without any EKG changes.
She was held off all anticoagulation given her metastatic disease to the brain.
She did have limited movement in her arms, given that she has a history of bursitis.
She could not ambulate without assistance and does need help with all bed transfers.
Her strength was notable for weakness throughout but was symmetric.
Metastatic melanoma with metastases to the liver, lung and brain.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Coronary artery disease.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
for UTI  prophylaxis.
