Admission Date:  [**2165-12-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2165-12-24**]   Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5547**] Chief Complaint: Repeated small bowel obstructions  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Wedge biopsy of lesion in left lateral segment of the liver.
History of Present Illness: 81-year-old lady with a history of hypertension, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and a possible right renal cell carcinoma, who has been admitted on three separate occasions to [**Hospital3 36606**] Hospital in [**Hospital1 189**] over the last several months for repeated small bowel obstructions.
She states that prior to presentation to this hospital, she had significant complaints of crampy abdominal pain with excessive nausea and vomiting.
She was told that these repeated bowel obstructions were secondary to adhesions related to her prior abdominal operations.
An upper GI series with small bowel follow-through was obtained on [**2165-12-6**], and this showed evidence of a 5-cm stricture at the jejunoileal transition, suggestive of an inflammatory process but also consistent with infection, ischemia, or tumor.
Past Medical History: hypertension, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and a possible right renal cell carcinoma  Social History: The patient is married and is accompanied to this visit today by her husband as well as by one of her three children ([**Female First Name (un) 24743**]).
Family History: There is no family history of malignancies or inflammatory bowel disease.
There are no carotid bruits.
Abdomen reveals a right paramedian as well as a lower midline incision.
There is no evidence of hernia.
Her abdomen is soft and nontender without palpable mass.
Right renal mass, for which the differential includes oncocytoma or renal cell carcinoma.
Complex left renal cyst.
Mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, including a calcified mesenteric nodal mass.
Findings consistent with pulmonary hypertension.
No pulmonary masses to correspond to recent chest x-ray.
[**2165-12-23**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (may be due to hyperdynamic state).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic gradient is likely related to high cardiac output.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Postoperatively the patient remained AF with VSS, the only complication being low urine output for which the patient responded well to fluid boluses.
EKG was obtained which was consistent for afib, and Hct were sent which was WNL.
Cardiology also felt that the patient's two episodes of syncope in the past were the result of autonomic dysfunction, advocating slow elevation from the bedside or from a sitting position to avoid further episodes.
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Please call a physician or go to the emergency room if you experience fever >101.4F, pain unrelieved by medication, intractable nausea or vomiting, or foul-smelling drainage coming from your incision.
