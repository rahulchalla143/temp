He began to develop worsening voice and slowly progressive shortness of breath, noisy breathing and was initially treated for a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation flare with oxygen nebulizers, intravenous steroids and antibiotics.
He was then worked up by an outside otolaryngologist who found what is believed to be a T4N0M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the glottis.
He was seen by cardiology who determined him to be high risk surgical candidate secondary to congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, but surgery was necessary and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for an ENT evaluation for tracheotomy versus laryngectomy.
His examination revealed inspiratory [**Last Name (un) 15883**], speaking without distress.
His left nare showed polypoid changes of the posterior aspect of the left inferior turbinate.
The neck showed fullness anteriorly, but no obviously palpable lymph nodes.
On the fiberoptic examination it revealed a large irregular mass on the right arytenoid with fixation of the right true vocal cord.
There was poor excursion of the left true vocal cord with a 2 mm airway.
Lungs had faint expiratory wheezes.
Anterior Q waves in V1 through V4 with ST elevation.
CT scan of the chest with contrast on [**2170-7-27**] showed no evidence of metastatic disease in the thorax.
It did show thickening of the mucosa with enhancement in the laryngeal region consistent with his known laryngeal cancer.
On postoperative day six the patient developed erythema and induration at the stoma site with no fluctuance and at that time one JP drain was discontinued.
On postoperative day eight the patient had an episode of hypotension to 80/42.
He remained asymptomatic and recheck of the blood pressure was 90/60 with an unchanged electrocardiogram.
Later that same evening the patient had an episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia times ten beats at 125 beats per minute, but was asymptomatic with stable blood pressure.
On day eleven the patient had a swallow study, which showed no aspiration.
The patient will also follow up with his primary care physician regarding his cardiac health and diabetes management.
