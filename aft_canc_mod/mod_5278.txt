The symptoms started between 8-9am ~ 2 hours prior to presentation and started at rest.
At home she did note associated nausea and diaphoresis.
No associated LH or SOB.
She denies any [**Known lastname **] chest pain.
No radiation to back.
No fevers, chills, or vomiting.
Of note, she had a recent normal stress Echo in [**4-/2192**], ordered because she had some shortness of breath during her most recent admission for diarrhea.
ECG showed < 1mm [**Apartment Address(1) **],3 w/ 1 mm STD 1, aVL and was discussed with Cardiology fellow.
She received viscous lidocaine and morphine with resolution of her discomfort.
Currently chest pain free.
Past Medical History: - AML - Hypertension - Hypercholesterolemia - GERD - Type two diabetes mellitus - diet controlled - Diverticulosis, noted on colonoscopy 4 years ago - Occasional bronchospasm treated with Primatene Mist - h/o SVC clot [**2191**] [**2-18**] PORT (s/p course of lovenox) - h/o C.Diff [**3-23**] & [**5-23**] .
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY (from OMR): The patient was diagnosed with AML in [**9-22**] on routine blood work that showed pancytopenia, bone marrow biopsy showed myelodysplasia with no cytogenetic abnormalities, repeat bone marrow biopsy showed acute erythroleukemia admitted [**2-23**] for induction chemotherapy with 7+3 cytarabine and idarubicin, which she tolerated well, Day 14 bone marrow showed zero blasts, consistent with complete ablation.
She then underwent allogeneic transplantation from an HLA matched sibling donor with pentostatin/TBI in [**3-23**] c/b mild GVHD, skin (mouth [**12-23**]) and colon (preliminary colon bx suggestive of gvhd [**1-24**], however final diagnosis of no definitive diagnosis of graft-versus-host disease communicated after the case has been reviewed).
Father with history of colon caner.
No other known history of cancer in the family.
No known blood disorders.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Bibasilar crackles 1/4 up, higher R>L.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+   Pertinent Results: [**Age over 90 2239**]|104| 21 / 208   AGap=14 3.5| 26|1.1 \                                     99 CK: 38  MB: Notdone Trop-T: <0.01       8.0\______/227 ALT: 18 AP: 68 Tbili: 0.2 Alb:             / 38.8 \ AST: 19 [**Doctor First Name **]:  Lip: 41  ECG [**2192-6-10**]: Tracing at 10:29am Regular Sinus at 65 bpm, Regular intervals, Leftward axis, 1mm STD I, aVL (downward sloping) wiht 1mm STE in III, aVF, and possibly in II as well suggesting inferior active ischemia.
Tracing at 15:59:26 Sinus bradycardia at HR 51 bpm, Q waves in II (1mmx0.5mm), III, aVF, TWI in III aVF still with ~0.5-1mm STE.
Right sided leads without ischmic changes.
No acute intrathoracic pathology is noted.
Rim-like lucency is noted under the left hemidiaphragm, the presence of free air cannot be excluded.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed severe 2 vessel coronary disease.
The LCX had no obstructive coronary disease.
The RCA had serial stenoses, the greatest of which was 99% in the mid-portion with evidence of thrombus or dissection.
Successful thrombectomy, and direct stenting of the proximal and mid RCA lesions with overlapping (distal to proximal) 3x33, 3.5x13,3.5x23, 3.5x13mm cypher stents post dilated to 4.0mm.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and timi 3 flow.
TTE (Focused views) Done [**2192-6-12**] There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal basal to mid inferior akinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2192-5-15**], the inferior wall motion abnormality is new and the right ventricular basal free wall motion abnormality is also new.
MYOCARDIAL ELEVATION, TRANSIENT ST ELEVATION The patinet was started on heparin in the ED after she developed transient ST elevations in inferior leads and lateral STD; initial cardiac enzymes were negative.
ECG evolved over the next six hours with TWI in interior leads and resolution of lateral STD.
She had no further episodes of her presenting constellation of symptoms, but did have intermittent epigastric discomfort and nausea.
ECG on am of [**2192-6-11**] had reemergence of lateral STD and she was taken to the catheterization lab.
LAD lesion not intervened upon as it was not the culprit lesion.
Unclear what options remain for intervention should she develop in-stent thrombosis/restenosis or LAD occlusion; CABG may be an option.
ANAPHYLACTOID/CONTRAST ALLERGY The patient developed an anaphylactoid reaction to IV contrast used during cardiac cath.
Prior to the procedure on [**2192-6-11**], she was started on fluids, diphenhydramine 50mg po, ranitidine 150mg po, methylprednisolone 125mg IV, and prednisone 40mg as pretreatment for a known iodidine allergy.
The evening of her procedure she developed generalized erythema.
She had no other complaints at the time, SBP was 90s, and exam was normal except for diffuse blanching erythema.
Her rash erythema improved.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient's course was complicated by prerenal failure from poor forward flow in setting of hypotension; her acute renal failure improved to 1.0 as she became normotensive.
Received 125mg methylprednisolone in setting of hypotension initially, then steroid regimen as per anaphylactoid reaction treatment described above.
Blood glucose was elevated secondary to steroids.
Diphenhydramine HCl 25 mg Capsule Sig: [**1-18**] Capsules PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for itching.
Disp:*60 Capsule(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: ST elevation myocardial infarction s/p stent to RCA Anaphylactoid reaction to IV contrast   Discharge Condition: Stable, on room air, ambulating; cleared by PT   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with chest pain and were found to have a blockage in one of your coronary arteries, which caused a heart attack.
You had a reaction to the contrast dye given during angiography which caused a diffuse body rash and required ICU transfer.
