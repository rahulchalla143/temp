Hypoattenuating periventricular and subcortical right and left frontal lesions display no evidence of enhancement (contrast still within the intracranial circulation from prior contrast-enhanced CT) which is highly suggestive of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
If there is continued high clinical suspicion, MRI may be ordered for more sensitive evaluation.
Limited evaluation due to marked amount of respiratory artifact.
No evidence of aortic dissection or central/segmental pulmonary emboli.
Multifocal right and left lower lobe pneumonia with large amount of secretions noted within the airways, suggesting aspiration as etiology.
Soft tissue thickening along the left lower lobe bronchovascular bundle, may be reactive in etiology, however, underlying neoplastic involvement cannot be excluded.
Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules in this patient who is status post right upper lobectomy consistent with metastatic lung cancer.
Hypoattenuating right thyroid lesion likely benign.
If alteration clinical management will occur, can consider further evaluation with dedicated ultrasound.
Dilated main pulmonary artery suggestive of underlying pulmonary hypertension in this patient with backgroun emphysema.
pulm edema evidence heart failure  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 80 year old man with aspiration pneumonia, copd, non small lung cancer s/p fluid rescucitation with crackles, oxygen requirement  REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: ?
pulm edema evidence heart failure HISTORY: Aspiration pneumonia with the previous malignancy status post fluid resuscitation with crackles, to evaluate for overhydration.
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2-25**], there is little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
Specifically, no evidence of pulmonary congestion.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Respiratory distress/PNA: multifocal pneumonia on CT s/p witnessed aspiration events.
Influenza negative.
Speech and swallow evaluation with some aspiration but recommended regular diet, crushed pills.
No further aspiration in house.

No suspicion for acute coronary syndrome/acute coronary thrombus.
ECG without specific ST changes.
No beta blocker given severe pulmonary disease, deferred to outpatient providers.
Transient hypotension/Hypertension on presentation:  Pt was initially hypertensive in ED, but then developed transient hypotension to 80's after recieiving nitro gtt and ?nitropaste.
Pt became normotensive after only 500cc NS in emergency room.
NSCLC: metastatic disease on palliative treatment.
No signs of metastatic disease on head CT.
6.Diarrhea:  Patient with chronic intermittent diarrhea.
Family reports occurs with chemo or antibiotics and sometimes randomly, usually prn loperamide.
In house, developed diarrhea on [**3-1**].
Additionally,  metformin had been re-started that day so possible side effect vs. antibiotic effect vs. chronic issue.
No further diarrhea.
Discharged on 5 days flagyl beyond cessation of other antibiotics given high risk for c. diff infection.
A few days of nebulizers in place of combivent given penumonia but back on home regimen by [**3-2**].
Loperamide 2 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for diarrhea.

As we discussed, the metformin can cause nausea and diarrhea.
