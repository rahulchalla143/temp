Current medical history began in [**2196-5-10**] when he experienced generalized tonic clonic seizure.
He was found to have a left frontal mass.
At that time, he also developed a DVT and had an IVC filter placed.
The mass was eventually resected on [**2196-6-20**] with pathology consistent for glioblastoma multiforme.
He also developed a shuffling gait and some unsteadiness on his feet and urinary incontinence.
He had been started on Ditropan XL with improvement of his urinary incontinence and urinary urgency.
The patient denied headaches, nausea, vomiting or tonic clonic seizures.
Glioblastoma multiforme, status post resection, status post boron neutron capture therapy on [**2196-7-26**].
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE: (1) Encephalopathy:  Multiple possible explanations for encephalopathy were pursued.
First of all, for question of dehydration the patient was given IV fluids.
The patient underwent an EEG which showed generalized slowing, but no seizure activity.
The patient also had a lumbar puncture performed to rule out any infectious etiology or neoplastic meningitis.
The patient underwent an MRI of his head on [**2196-9-17**], which showed no bleed and no significant swelling.
The patient's encephalopathy and also gait disturbance seemed most likely to be consistent with radiation somnolence syndrome especially given his experimental status for this therapy.
Possible treatment for his encephalopathy and gait disturbance the patient was started on Sinemet.
His MRI on [**2196-9-6**] and also on [**2196-9-16**], did not show any significant findings that would be consistent with the glioblastoma multiforme as the cause for the patient's current symptoms.
(3) Cardiovascular:  On [**2196-9-18**], the patient became acutely diaphoretic and had decreased oxygen saturations.
An EKG was obtained, which showed a new right bundle branch block and also some ST segment elevations.
The patient was treated for this acute coronary syndrome with a sublingual nitroglycerin, aspirin and additional doses of IV Lopressor.
Although the patient had originally not experienced any chest pain with this event, shortly afterwards the patient developed substernal chest pain, which radiated to his arm.
