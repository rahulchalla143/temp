Scheduled for rigid bronch [**2108-11-12**] but did not wake up after procedure and became progressively apneic and hypotensive.
Pt has recent hx of stent placements due to occlusion [**1-2**] metastatic lesions.
Pt returned for bronch on day of admission and had debridement of mucous and granulation tissue.
After bronchoscope removed pt as unresponsive and apneic.

Abd: soft non tender non distended, +bs Ext: WWP, tatoo on left upper extremity, DP 2+ bilaterally  Pertinent Results: [**2108-11-12**] 09:42PM   CORTISOL-40.8* [**2108-11-12**] 06:25PM   TYPE-ART TEMP-36.4 RATES-16/3 TIDAL VOL-475 PEEP-5 O2-40 PO2-72* PCO2-55* PH-7.40 TOTAL CO2-35* BASE XS-6 INTUBATED-INTUBATED VENT-CONTROLLED [**2108-11-12**] 04:00PM   TYPE-ART TEMP-36.7 PO2-171* PCO2-66* PH-7.32* TOTAL CO2-36* BASE XS-5 [**2108-11-12**] 03:55PM   PT-13.6 PTT-30.6 INR(PT)-1.2 [**2108-11-12**] 03:13PM   freeCa-0.97* [**2108-11-12**] 03:00PM   GLUCOSE-57* UREA N-14 CREAT-0.5 SODIUM-129* POTASSIUM-4.3 CHLORIDE-101 TOTAL CO2-23 ANION GAP-9 [**2108-11-12**] 03:00PM   WBC-3.2*# HCT-20.0*#  ECG: Atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response Q waves inferiorly - consider inferior myocardial infarction  CT CHEST BEFORE AND AFTER IV CONTRAST: There is adequate opacification of the pulmonary arterial vasculature without evidence of embolus or thrombus.
There is a large right upper lobe perihilar mass with branching soft tissue structures extending into the right upper lobe consistent with mucus plugging or tumor.
There are moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis in both lower lobes.
There are air bronchograms seen peripherally at the right base and this can suggest pneumonia.
Multiple rounded nodules are seen scattered throughout the right middle lobe and left lung, consistent with the given history of metastatic disease.
Early arterial views of the upper abdomen show a large liver without focally-enhancing masses but the timing of contrast is not optimal for detecting liver metastases.
No suspicious lesions are seen in the bones.
No pulmonary embolus.
Branching tubular opacities in the left upper lung can relate to mucus plugging, tumor infiltration, and infection there is certainly not excluded.
Large effusions with bibasilar atelectasis/consolidation.
Multiple rounded nodules consistent with metastatic disease.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 67 year-old male with progressive metastatic colon cancer to lung, s/p RMSB stent placement, admitted with respiratory failure post procedure.
Repeat bronch on [**11-13**] showed 50% occlusion of R mainstem bronchus, aspirated.
No evidence of post-obstructive pneumonia.
Rebronch on [**11-14**] revealed 50% occluded stent which was removed, tumor debrided and stent replaced with residual distal granulation tissue.
Sputum cx from [**11-25**] eventually grew out Enterobacter, sensitive to all abx.
On [**11-27**] pt grew gram neg rods on sputum gram stain, likely contaminate.
In light of patient's fevers and worsening secreations pt was placed on Vanco and Levo initially, then Zosyn to replace Levo.
[**11-27**]: restarted vanco/levo/gent for worsening secretions and fever.
Etiology of such weakness unclear, but likely secondary to increased dead space with tumor infiltration of pulmonary vasculature (demonstrated by CT scan) + respiratory muscle deconditioning.
2) HTN: pt started on captopril  3) AF: Patient with intermittent episodes of afib with slow ventricular response.
4) DM: good glycemic control was achieved with SSI and standing NPH  5) MS changes: pt was extremely agitated at times initially treated with Haldol and then well controlled with zyprexa 2.5mg TID  6) Nutrition: a PEG tube was placed on [**2108-12-5**] without complication and tube feeds were initiated via the PEG the next day.
