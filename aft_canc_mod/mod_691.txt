Benign prostatic hypertrophy with PSA of 16 and normal imaging.
Chronic rectal bleeding in the setting with known colon carcinoma treated for several months with transfusions.
Squamous cell carcinoma of the left shoulder.
Abdominal examination:  The patient had a soft, nontender, nondistended abdomen, no palpable masses.
Postoperatively, the patient was noted to be slightly tachycardic with a pulse of 102.
Overnight on postoperative day one, the patient did well complaining of only mild pain.
On postoperative day two, [**2115-11-9**], the Green Surgery team was contact[**Name (NI) **] by the floor, called to see the patient for a complaint of heart pounding.
An electrocardiogram was obtained which demonstrated atrial fibrillation.
The patient was placed on Telemetry for monitoring.
Following this, the patient was given 20 mg of Lopressor and 50 mg of diltiazem without response.
He was noted to have a low potassium for which he was put on 40 mEq of IV potassium.
At that time, the patient was also formally ruled out for myocardial infarction through serial CKs all went over 226, serial troponins that rose to a level of 0.3.
During transport to the Intensive Care Unit, the patient spontaneously converted into a sinus rhythm, and after further review of the electrocardiogram, it was decided that the patient's symptoms are more likely a supraventricular tachycardia versus aflutter and afib.
Cardiology service came to see the patient with the impression that patient had postoperative atrial fibrillation, paroxysmal and asymptomatic as well as hypertension.
The patient was transferred on Telemetry to the floor, where he is noted to be in a rhythm of atrial flutter versus atrial fibrillation with a rate somewhat tachycardic in the low 100s.
After these discussions, it was felt by the attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**], the patient was fully aware of the risks to his health if he left the hospital without proper workup and treatment of his dysrhythmia in light of this patient's wish to leave.
