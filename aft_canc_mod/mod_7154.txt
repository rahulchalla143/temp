Patient was section'd 12 by PCP today as there was a question of competency and sent to the ED.
Per patient, he reports diarrhea recently off and on over the last 2 weeks, no BRBPR/melena/hematochezia.
Seborrheic dermatitis 4. h/o diastolic murmur 5.
MM dry, OP clear Neck: supple, no LAD or JVD Chest: CTA-B, no w/r/r CV: RRR s1 s2 normal, [**2-25**] diastolic murmur loudest at LUSB, no radiation Abd: soft, NT/ND, NABS, no HSM Ext: no c/c/e, wwp Neuro: AO x 2 (person, place, but not time).
No focal deficits.
Skin: multiple excoriations on extremities    Pertinent Results: [**2194-6-23**] CXR CHF with interstitial edema.
Subsegmental atelectasis, without focal consolidation.
Although no definite obstructing mass is seen, evaluation is limited due to absence of intravenous contrast.
Marked splenomegaly, displacing the left kidney anteromedially.
Cardiomegaly, anemia, and evidence of chronic lung disease.
[**2194-6-24**] Renal U/S Echogenic kidneys consistent with chronic medical renal disease.
Differential diagnosis includes a stone or potentially distal tumor.
Massive splenomegaly.
Potential right renal artery stenosis.
[**2194-6-24**] TTE The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction 40 percent).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is moderately dilated athe sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**1-21**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2194-6-25**] CTA Chest No pulmonary embolism.
Progression of consolidation at the left lung base concerning for aspiration/pneumonia.
Nodular opacities in the right upper lobe, one with a small cavity concerning for infection.
[**2194-6-25**] CT Head No acute abnormality.
Bone marrow biopsy Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by: a CD5 positive B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.
Pathology consistent with mantle cell lymphoma.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 y/o male resistant to medical care who presented with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia.
Acute Renal failure The pt was admitted to the ICU after he was found to be in severe acute renal failure accompanied by hyperkalemia.
U/A was significant for muddy brown casts and FeNa of 8%.
In addition, he had large left-sided hydronephrosis secondary to anatomic displacement of the left kidney by an enlarged spleen.
No stones or other causes were identified for the obstructive picture.
He was initiated on HD on admission for hyperkalemia after a right femoral HD line was placed on [**2194-6-23**], which improved with one session.
He was also given 1 bag of platelets and 2 doses of dDAVP given his uremic platelets.
Hemolysis labs on admission were negative, no evidence of TTP on peripheral smear.
In addition, flow cytometry has been sent and is consistent with mantle cell lymphoma.
FISH analysis confirmed mantle cell lymphoma.
The pt will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2148**] in one week for further management of his mantle cell lymphoma.
If pt elects to have treatment, it would be 3 or more weeks after discharge.
Lung lesions Patient underwent a CTA on [**2194-6-25**] to r/o PE as he developed sudden-onset tachycardia and hypoxia.
This was negative for PE and his symptoms were likely [**2-21**] volume overload from blood products.
This was reviewed the MICU attending who did not feel an active infection was present.
He has not had any symptoms of fever, cough, or productive sputum.
Given these abnormal findings and the fact that the patient will need chemotherapy, he will likely need a bronch prior to proceeding with treatment for his lymphoma.
# Hematuria - patient developed persistent hematuria with few clots beginning on [**2194-6-25**] after changing his foley.
Urology saw the patient and did not have any other additional recs.
# Elevated troponin - likely in setting of severe renal failure, CK-MB flat.
Troponin has remained elevated but stable with repeated sets, no new EKG changes.
ASA is being held given the thrombocytopenia and dysfunction platelets and oozing blood from lines and hematuria.
# Positive U/A - patient is on day 3 of ciprofloxacin, urine cx grew staph, however without significant growth.
# Capacity - patient was initially sectioned 12 by his PCP as he has been resistant to medical care and there was concern for whether he had capacity to make his decisions.
Psychiatry saw the patient and deemed him to have capacity to make his decisions; however, if he becomes uncooperative with medical treatments, they need to be [**Name (NI) 653**], as there is some concern whether the patient has full understanding of the situation.
# F/E/N - renal diet .
# PPx - pneumoboots .
# Access - 2 PIV, right femoral HD cath .
# Dispo - to floor as stable   Medications on Admission: None  Discharge Medications: 1.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Renal failure Mantle Cell Lymphoma .
Secondary: Hypertension   Discharge Condition: The patient was discharged to rehab hemodynamically stable afebrile with appropriate follow up.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for renal failure.
You were also diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma after your spleen was found to be very large which was not allowing the urine to drain from your kidney.
