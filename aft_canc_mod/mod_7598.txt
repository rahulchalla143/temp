Admission Date:  [**2171-3-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-3-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2090-5-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillin V  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30062**] Chief Complaint: Lightheadedness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Placement of ET tube Placement of NG tube Placement of central line  History of Present Illness: 80 y/o F with h/o CAD s/p MI with stents in [**2164**], Htn, HL and recent bout of pneumonia, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH where she was found to have a leukocytosis of 137K with 88% lymphocytes.
She had been in USOH after discharge on [**3-1**] from recent admission for pneumonia at [**Hospital **] hospital, where she had been treated with antibiotics and steroids.
She saw her PCP earlier today, who found her to have orthostatic hypotension, and checked labs revealing leukocytosis to 113K with 84% lymphocytes and many atypical lymphs.
She was referred to [**Hospital **] Hospital, where repeat labs showed WBC of 137K, with 88% lymphocytes and moderate smudge cells.
Of note, she was recently admitted to [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital from [**2-24**] for pneumonia, and was discharged on antibiotics (completed course on [**3-5**]) and prednisone (last dose of 30 mg taken on [**3-7**]).
Exam was notable for irregularly irregular heart rhythm.
Labs revealed leukocytosis of 96.3K with 88% lymphocytes and no bands.
ECG showed atrial fibrillation at ~80 bpm, LAD, TWI in I, aVL, V4-V6, and Q waves in V1-V2.
While on the floor this morning, the team noted that she was hypotensive to 90s/60s and she was started on vancomycin and cefepime for coverage of possible HCAP.
Heme/onc also saw the patient and reviewed her blood smear and saw that she had smudge cells consistent with CLL but also some immature lymphocytes.
This in conjunction with a rapid rise in her WBC count over the past year made cause for concern that she might have an immature clone, and her blood was sent for flow cytometry.
This evening, the patient subsequently developed an extremely rapid heart rate of 130s-140s while continuing to drop her pressures, which nadired at 78 systolic on the floor and spiked a temperature of 101.1.
She also developed some respiratory distress and wheezing and was given a duoneb.
The patient continued to mentate throughout, and complained of dizziness and lightheadedness whenever she moved.
She reported some mild shortness of breath but no chest pain.
Past Medical History: -CAD s/p MI and stent placement x2 in [**2164**] (First stent [**2164-8-30**], 2nd [**2164-10-10**]) -Htn -HL -atrial fibrillation (never on warfarin, [**2-20**] past GI bleed) -hx of hemolytic anemia in [**2165**] (confirmed by PCP), Rx'd rituximab (not confirmed by PCP patient does not remember) -iron deficiency anemia -s/p appendectomy -s/p hysterectomy -s/p L shoulder arthroscopy [**2166**] -s/p tonsillectomy  Social History: Lives at home with children/grandchildren.
Performs all her own ADLs, and remains active with her employment.
No cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
+[**3-24**] holosystolic murmur most prominent at apex.
No S3/S4 Abdomen: no splenomegaly or hepatomegaly.
soft, NT/ND, BS present, no rebound tenderness or guarding Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
No axillary or inguinal lymphadenopathy Neuro: 5/5 strength upper and lower extremities, proximally and distally.
PATHOLOGY: [**2171-3-8**] CXR: Right middle lobe opacity may represent atelectasis or pneumonia.
Small right pleural effusion.
[**2171-3-10**] B/l LE LENI: No DVT of the bilateral lower extremity.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a moderate resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Moderate LVH, small, hyperdynamic left ventricle with consequent development of an LVOT gradient as the mitral valve, chordae and papillary muscle contact the interventricular septum during systole.
Diastolic dysfunction probably present.
There is calcific aortic stenosis, again the severity cannot be determined on the basis of this echo.
There is at least mild mitral regurgitation.
[**2171-3-12**] TTE: Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
The heart rate is much slower and the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now identified.
Severe aortic valve stenosis is suggested with a peak velocity of 4m/s (64 mmHg).
[**2171-3-18**] Renal U/S: No hydronephrosis and no stones.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 y/o F with h/o CAD s/p MI with stents in [**2164**], Htn, HL and recent bout of pneumonia, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH where she was found to have a leukocytosis of 137K with 88% lymphocytes concerning for leukemia.
She developed hypotension and respiratory distress in the setting of Afib with RVR, and was tranferred to the ICU for further management.
A TEE demonstrated severe LVOT obstruction.
She was made comfortable with a morphine gtt, scopolamine patch, lorazepam and sublingual levsin.
# Respiratory distress/Shock: Initially felt to be secondary to sepsis considering the patient's recent treatment for pneumonia, small infiltrate on CXR, and sputum positive for GNRs.
She was intubated on [**3-11**] due to worsening respiratory distress.
An ECHO revealed a hyperdynamic LV with consequent development of an LVOT gradient at the mitral valve.
Repeat ECHO showed severe AS, and much of her symptoms were felt to be due to this.
However, subsequent TEE demonstrated that patient's cardiac dysfunction was secondary to significant LVOT obstruction, and that her aortic valve was not significantly stenosed.
She was given increased volume with hopes of increasing cardiac output, without significant improvement.
She continued to have RVR and was started on an amiodarone gtt and heparin gtt.
On [**3-11**] she developed SVT vs. VT (rate 200/minute), pulse present.
Shock delivered - returned to atrial fibrillation with slower rate (<100).
This was felt likely due to poor renal perfusion in the setting of hypotension.
# CLL: Peripheral smear showed smudge cells and immature lymphoctyes, concerning for acute transformation.
She was started on allopurinoal and IVF due to elevated uric acid and risk of tumor lysis.
# GI Bleed: Pt with h/o erosive gastritis seen on an EGD in [**2161**].
She had intermittent coffee-ground material suctioned from her NG tube.
# CAD, MI s/p stenting: .
# Hypertension: Anti-hypertensives were initially held in the setting of sepsis.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued simvastatin.
