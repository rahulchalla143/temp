Pt has long-standing pericardial effusion with slow progression in size over the last year.
Denies SOB at rest, orthopnea, PND, CP, palpitations  Recently admitted from [**12-2**] for similar symptoms of worsening DOE.
During that admission chest CT and echo were performed which showed moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion extending 1.7 cm posterior and lateral to the left ventricle, 2.0 cm around the right ventricular free wall, 1.7 cm around the right atrium without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Dyslipidemia 3.
Narrow angle glaucoma s/p Laser eye surgery 4.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2161-12-1**], there has been no significant change.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2161-12-11**]: CXR: no evidence of pneumomediastinum or other complications post-pericardiocentesis  Brief Hospital Course: 1.
No tamponade physiology.
Several minutes post-procedure, pt became agitated and stridorous without evidence of laryngeal edema or tongue swelling.
The patient then developed pericarditis after the drain was pulled with manifested itself as [**11-15**] chest pressure, mainly pleurtic, and an EKG with PR depressions and ST scooping.
She also had elevations in her CK, but a negative MB and negative troponins and therefore not from myocardial destruction.
Dyspnea: Since significant removal of pericardial fluid occurred an the patient's DOE did not improve, the effusion is likely not related to her DOE.
Alprazolam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
Ibuprofen 600 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for chest pain.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: pericardial drain pericarditis metastatic breast cancer   Discharge Condition: good  Discharge Instructions: Call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if you experience chest pain again.
