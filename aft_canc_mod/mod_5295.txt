These were associated with chills and body aches but no rigors or nightsweats.
At LGH, the patient was found to be neutropenic with 72% lymphocytes and a WBC of 0.5.
Further lab tests upon admission included a leukemia/lymphoma eval which yielded abundant myeloblasts with a probable diagnosis of AML.
CT of the chest and abdomen was performed as part of the lymphoma workup with the following key findings:  1) R paratracheal mass (3.2cm)with BL pleural effusions.
2) Multiple small liver and splenic lesions of intermediate nature.
3) Small pancreatic lesion (1.6cm) 4) BL inguinal hernias.
Hypertension treated with Toprol XL 100mg daily at home for some time.
No other medical issues or surgeries.
Family History: Mother died age 53 of a heart attack.
Neck: No LAD, No JVD, Midline trachea.
Normal sized thyroid with no palpable nodules.
Chest: decreased breath sounds bilaterally CV: irregular, irregular, II/VI SM Abd: BS normoactive, nontender, nondistended, increased adiposity of gut.
No tender nodules.
Pertinent Results: At [**Hospital6 3105**]:  CT of the chest and abdomen was performed as part of the lymphoma workup with the following key findings:  1) R paratracheal mass (3.2cm)with BL pleural effusions.
2) Multiple small liver and splenic lesions of intermediate nature.
3) Small pancreatic lesion (1.6cm) 4) BL inguinal hernias.
DAY 1 was [**2169-8-18**], BM bx completed three times, with the latest report from [**10-2**] showing no evidence of leukemic cells.
Fever and neutropenia/ID: High fevers persisted, pt had multiple imaging studies including a CT Chest, Abd Pelvis that revealed multiple splenic and liver nodules and mediastinal LAD.
Pt was seen by ID and pulm (for RLL effusion and mediastinal LAD seen on CT scan).
Patient developed some diarrhea, C.diff sent, which was negative on multiple occasions.
Stool also tested for cryptosporidium/O and P/campylobacter- all of which were negative.
Repeat thoracentesis failed to show further afb growth in culture, was also negative for CMV.
CT chest on [**9-5**] revealed stable nodules but new pericardial effusion.
When patient returned to BMT, he was placed on Rifabutin, Ethambutol, Pyridoxine, Clarithromycin for MAC coverage, as TB+ blood cxs likely MAC vs. TB, anti-TB meds d/ced, other atypical mycobacteria was also a consideration.
Patient was started on Vanc empirically on [**9-17**] as blood cultures from [**9-15**] returned [**2-14**] gram + cocci=coag neg staph and those from [**9-17**].
On [**9-21**], patient underwent a TEE, which was negative for endocarditis, and a mediastinal LN biopsy, which was positive for afb on smear and culture.
Patient underwent repeat thorax CT, which showed enlarging abdominal LN and an increasing number of splenic and liver lesions.
Patient underwent a repeat echo and chest x-ray which showed a small to moderate pleural effusion and a small decrease in the mediastinal LAD.
The patient was placed on an 11 week steroid taper (beginning with 60mg prednisone daily) per ID recs to help lessen risk of constrictive pericarditis.
Patient was arranged with follow-up in the [**Hospital **] clinic in [**Month (only) 359**], and will be followed by the state center for tuberculosis as well for medication administration.
Cardiology: Patient developed AFib w/ rapid response to 180's, and unstable BP (SBP=90's) - therefore was transferred to the ICU on [**9-11**] where he underwent unsuccessful attempts at cardioversion x3.
An CXR showed an increased interstitial and alveolar infiltrate especially on the R side with positive air bronchograms on the R side.
An emergent ECHO showed no signs of cardiac tamponade.
Abxs were stopped as repeat CXR did not show any signs of infection and WBC was back to normal.
Acute respiratory failure was thought to have happened in the setting of intravascular fluid depletion with decreased preload leading to tachycardia and tachypnea, worsening the preload even more.
In addition a pulmonary edema and an increasing pleural effusion pressing on the lund might have contributed.
Cardiology also recommended continued diuresis for pleural and pericardial effusions.
Patient was decreased to 200mg of daily amiodarone on [**10-2**], with monitoring of LFTs and TSH, which were normal.
Echo on [**10-3**] ECHO w/ EF=30%, global LV hypokinesis, and repeat on [**10-9**] shows small-moderate pleural effusion.
Splenic/Liver Lesions Initially thought to be mets, lymph nodes, or other primary cancer contributing to recent development of changes in blood glucose levels.
Pt also experienced chronic RUQ abd pain during his hospitalization.
Necrotic lymph nodes in the superior mediastinum and in the periportal region.
Multiple tiny areas of low attenuation in liver and spleen.
Although non-specific, these could represent microabscesses from hematogenous spread of infection, including tuberculosis or fungal infections.
MRI on [**8-25**] confirmed CT findings and showed potential renal involvement.
Follow-up CT on [**10-2**] showed an increased number of lesions in both liver and spleen (all < 1cm), still thought to be dissemintated TB.
A repeat chest CT [**9-18**] showed increased size of pulm nodules 3mm->5mm.
A repeat CT on [**10-2**] showed no change.
Elevated Blood Glucose Despite no prior history of DM, this patient has consistently had elevated glucoses on FS in the past week.
Given his increasing O2 requirements and increased work of breathing, he was intubated in the ICU.
Coagulopathy:  Pt w/ persistently elevated INR, PT.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you develop fever/chills/nausea or vomiting.
