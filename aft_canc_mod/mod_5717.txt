Admission Date:  [**2174-2-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2174-3-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2122-12-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 562**] Chief Complaint: hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: R internal jugular central line  History of Present Illness: 51 yo male with AIDs (dx [**2158**], on HAART, VL undetectable, CD4 90 [**1-3**], h/o thrush and esophagitis) admitted with back pain/flank pain and fevers.
He was in hus USOH until [**2174-1-27**] when he went to his PCP's with R sided pleurtic chest pain.
He also had a resurangence of fevers to 102 - 105 and night sweats which he had had for 13 years, then stopped 2 years prior when he started HAART.
CXR on [**2174-1-27**] showed infiltrate within the left upper lobe and an opacityl at the right heart border.
Then on [**2174-2-3**], he went to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with L calf pain.
Chest CT at that time also showed multiple bilateral segments and subsegmental pulmonary emboli, consolidation vs. infarct in the posterior left upper lobe and anterior right lower lobe, multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
During this stay, he had no pulmonary symptoms.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was not doing well at home since he was having extreem pain in both his legs.
The swelling in the LLE diminished, but the right increased.
He had no pulmonary symptoms until the afternoon on [**2-18**] when he began to become SOB.
In ED, initial vitals were 103.6, HR 145, BP 78/62, RR 18, 98% -> 100% on 2L .He was complaiing of worsening SOB and pleurtic right chest pain.
A ct chest revealed a left upper lobe opacity, subsegmental PE's, multiple B pulm nodules.
Currently, he is SOB and c/o pleurtic right sided and posterior chest pain and bilateral calf pain.
He has been having fevers to 102 - 105 daily with night sweats.
Denies large weight gain (he has had touble with weight loss since his MAC).
No neck pain.
No recent PPD.
No recent travel.
Past Medical History: AIDS on HAART c/b thrush H/O MAC infection of unknown site DVT left leg- [**2174-2-3**] COPD- bullous changes intermittent diplopia asymptomatic UTI Moderate cervical spondylosis with moderate spinal canal stenosis and multilevel bilateral neural foraminal narrowing seen on MR cervical spine- [**2170**] Epidermal inclusion cyst- right thigh   Social History: +tobacco ([**1-31**] pack a day) x35 years and quit 2 weeks ago, no ETOH.
dentures in, no thrush seen.
no scleral icterus noted, MMM.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: diffusly tender with voluntary guarding.
normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
extreme right CVAT Extremities: 1+ pitting edema bilaterally on calf.
His shock is most likely due to sepsis given his increasing WBC and low CVP making right heart strain from PE unlikley.
Most likely this is sepsis, given that he is immunocompromised with fevers and respiratory distress.
Given his immunocomprimised state, he has many potential sources for sepsis including bactreial, fungal, and viral.
He had episode of NSVT on arrival while on dopamine and was changed over to levophed, which he required for several days of his addmision to keep MAP>65.
Given persistent hypotension concern for neurogenic shock secondary to autonomic dysfunction, Neuro consult was obtained who did not think that patient has autonomic dysfunction on initial assessement.
#  Respiratory distress - as above, most likely secondary to pulmonary infection complicated by pulmonary emboli.
# PE/DVT: Hx of DVT and PE on recent hospitalization.
Given likely coumadin failure IVC filter was placed.
[**2-27**] AM with RUE swelling as well, with DVT.
- Given recurrent dvt and ?pulmonary nodules and enlarged lymphnode concern for malignancy in setting of hypercoguble state high.
hemoptysis - likely secondary to underlying pulmonary processes.
Continues to urinate to the point of hypotension despite IVF being stopped.
They did not think that the pt has diabetes insipidus given that the patient has had normal Uosm and Una.
More likely, this is consistent with a solute diuresis from the large amounts of fluid the patient has received during this hospitalization.
# Infection - unclear etiology most likely source of infectionis pulmonary, but differential in this immunocompromised patient is very broad.
Also with nystagmus on exam concerning for brainstem process.
- MRI/MRA -small L cerebellar stroke, w/ sluggish basilar artery flow, CTA also showed no thrombus but decreased basilar artery flow.
Per Neuro ordered TTE w/ bubble, no ASD or PFO - Daily CT showed no change (needs daily CTx7 day to assess no hemorrhagic development .
If decompensates of hemoptysis progresses beyond tsp amounts will need bronchoscopy and possible surgical consult.
Also with nystagmus on exam concerning for brainstem process.
# AIDS: Initially held  HAART therapy.
o/w infection as above.
with LUL mass, discuss timing of biopsy as differential includes lymphoma vs lung neoplasm, will need to discuss holding anticoagulation.
An IVC filter was placed to prevent further pulmonary emboli.
He developed ischemic bowel with thrombosis of celiac and mesenteric arteries.
