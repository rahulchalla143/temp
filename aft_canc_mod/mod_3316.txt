Patient was no longer having melenic stools.
Patient was started on IV fluids for rehydration after patient had bouts of diarrhea secondary to C. diff, and his hematocrit slowly trended to 24.
Stools remained guiac positive although were grossly normal light brown color suggesting the slow decrease in Hct was secondary to ongoing oozing from the mass with a component of hemodilution from IVF.
Patient remained hemodynamically stable.
Pathology biopsy revealed poorly differentiated carcinoma with some endocrine features on routine microscopy.
CTA abdomen revealed abdominal lymphadenopathy centered around the porta hepatis concerning for metastatic spreads from patient's known ampullary cancer.
# Bacteremia: Clostridium perfringens bacteremia at [**Location (un) **] with concern over complications such as ascending cholangitis characterized by Charcot's triad (fever, jaundice, and abdominal pain) or [**Last Name (un) **] pentad (confusion and hypotension).
# Leukocytosis: Patient continued having leukocytosis despite covering for C. Perfringens, initially believed to be caused by pneumonia.
However, patient's WBC continued increasing, with no bandemia.
Patient remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable throughout.
# AAA: An infrarenal AAA measuring up to 3.3cm with associated periaortic triangular density suspicious for contained aortic wall rupture was incidentally discovered on CTA abdomen.
# Back pain: Patient has had chronic back pain, with no neurological deficits.
MRI was done to r/o cord compression vs epidural abscess and was normal.
Patient's pain was well controlled with Ultram 50mg po TID.
# Atherosclerosis: Ectasia and tortuosity of the abdominal aorta with atherosclerosis and possible ulcerated plaque were also noted on CTA abdomen.
# Respiratory distress: Patient was triggered for decreased respiratory rate and low oxygen saturations.
Patient was having some cough and was started on Levofloxacin with coverage later expanded to Vancomycin.
CTA was done to rule out pneumonia versus PE given poor oxygen saturation despite antibiotics and revealed no abnormalities.
Patient had low grade fevers to 100.4 and leukocytosis.
Patient did not have episodes of RVR during this hospitalization.
# INR: Was slightly elevated in setting of infection/malnutrition/liver congestion.
# Prostate Cancer: s/p radiation treatment at DF-peripheral site, metastatic to bones, no active issues, stable.
# PPX: IV PPI, pneumoboots  # Code: DNR/DNI confirmed with patient  # communication: with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 52**] (brother) at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 73429**] or [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 52**] (nephew) at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 73430**].
