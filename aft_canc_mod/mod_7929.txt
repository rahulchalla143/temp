Decreased intrahepatic biliary dilatation compared to prior study.
Massive abdominal lymphadenopathy with multiple splenic hypodense lesions highly concerning for lymphoma.
New 3.5 cm low density lesion anterior to spleen may reflect newly involved lymph node; otherwise, lymphadenopathy is not significantly changed.
Compression of the distal duodenum by the marked lymphadenopathy with distention of the stomach, suggesting duodenal obstrution.
Increasing bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, .
Redemonstration of right lower lung 5 mm pulmonary nodule with other previously noted lung nodules less evident, may be inflammatory or infectious in etiology, though metastases are a consideration.
CT chest [**10-23**]: IMPRESSION: Extensive lymphadenopathy in the thoracic inlet.
Numerical increase of non-enlarged thoracic lymph nodes.
Bilateral pleural effusions with subsequent areas of atelectasis.
Diffuse clustered nodular opacities in the lung parenchyma, assuming a distribution that suggests non-recent infection, compared with areas of parenchymal fibrosis and traction bronchiectasis as well as paramediastinal fibrosis.
Aerobilia of the biliary drainage.
Left level III/IV, level V, and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
Pleural effusions, pulmonary opacities, and mediastinal lymph nodes are better assessed on the concurrent chest CT. .
INTERPRETATION Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by a Kappa light chain restricted B-cell lymphoproliferative process which expresses CD10 and is negative for CD5, CD23 and FMC-7.
The differential diagnosis includes large B-cell lymphoma, Follicular lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma.
There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Preserved biventricular regional and global systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation in a structurally normal valve.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**10-24**]: IMPRESSION: Small area of possible focal gliosis is noted on the right frontal lobe, measuring approximately 10 x 6 mm in size, there is no evidence of abnormal enhancement in this lesion, other entities, including a non-enhancing mass lesion cannot be completely excluded.
There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to indicate acute or subacute ischemic changes.
Pathology [**10-26**]: DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal lymph nodes, incisional biopsy      Diffuse & Nodular large B cell lymphoma (See note) .
CXR [**10-26**]: Some atelectasis at the left base is seen but this was present on the prior chest x-ray of [**Month (only) **] the 11th.
No evidence of aspiration is otherwise identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of new opacity.
CSF Cytology [**10-29**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
CSF FLOW CYTOMETRY [**11-9**] Diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by B-cell lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
MR Pituitary [**11-1**]: IMPRESSION: Diffusely abnormal enhancement of the pituitary gland of unclear etiology, may be secondary to previous biopsy.
Please upload preoperative imaging if available to PACS for comparison.
Post-surgical changes along the anterior wall of the sphenoid sinus.
Bony defects in the anterior and inferior margins of the clivus.
Interval improvement of left biliary tree dilatation with persistent mild right intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Marked improvement of extensive periportal, paraduodenal, mesenteric, and paraaortic conglomerate adenopathy.
Interval decrease in size of a metastatic lesion anterior to the spleen.
Recommend followup to resolution in this patient with known malignancy.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with interval decrease on the left.
Splenic lesions are less conspicuous, possibly related to interval disease improvement and/or phase of contrast.
Unusual globular appearance of the pancreatic tail which appears isodense to the spleen; consider ectopic spleen, which could be confirmed with sulfur colloid study or damaged RBC study on a non-emergent basis.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary reason for hospitalization: Mr. [**Known lastname 28445**] is a 75 year old man with history of panhypopituitarism and suspected pituitary lesion status post undiagnostic transphenoidal biopsy who presented with sepsis due to biliary obstruction from mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
Patient recieved a percutaneous biliary drain and underwent a laparoscopic lymph node biopsy, results show diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
ACTIVE PROBLEMS BY ISSUE: # DLBCL: FNA provided differential of DLBCL, follicular, or Burkitt's.
Laparoscopic excisional LN biopsy definitively characterize as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
TTE for baseline cardiac assessment was grossly normal with EF>55% and no valvular abnormalities or focal hypokinesis.
LP was performed; Cytology of CSF shows no malignant cells.
Flow cytometry of CSF shows negative for malignant cells.
e was kept in the hospital for to assess need for CNS treatment for lymphoma as well given his pituitary problems below, however, it was finally decided that the pituitary is not due to lymphoma.
# Sepsis/Cholangitis: Patient had cholangitis secondary to biliary obstruction from large mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
Blood cultures drawn during sepsis grew pansensitve Klebsiella, and he completed a 14 day course of piperacillin/tazobactam.
Unfortunately, once he became neutropenic, he again developed sepsis and a cholangitis picture with right upper quadrant pain and elevated liver enzymes especially alkaline phosphatase.
# Hypernatremia: Patient was hypernatremic several times in the setting of high serum Osm and low urine Osm.
Patient had some guiac positive stools during admission and some diarrhea.
He was consistently negative for C. diff infection and it was thought that his diarrhea was due to the cathartic effect of blood.
MCV also trended down this hospitalization, more indicative of active bleeding leading to iron deficiency.
The most likely explanation for his intermittent guiac positive stools was small bleeding from his perc drain.
# Pituitary Mass/Panhypopituitarism:  Obtained [**Hospital1 3278**] records which showed patient was found to be panhypopit after presenting in severe malaise.
Then, presented with diplopia and was found to have unilateral 6th nerve palsy.
MRI brain showed abnormal enhancement of pituitary infundibulum.
Received transphenoidal biopsy, which showed normal bone in clivus and normal brain tissue in pituitary, no tumor cells.
MR brain this admission shows normal size and shape of pituitary; evidence of prior biopsy/surgery; no evidence of CNS lymphoma.
Patient also was diagnosed with central diabetes insipidus by endocrinology this admission (see below).
He was discharged on prednisone 10 mg daily to support his adrenal function and his levothyroxine was increased to 100 daily due to constipation and 4 low-normal.
It was decided by the neuro-oncolgy tumor board that without evidence of CNS lymphoma by MRI, biopsy, and 2 LPs it was unlikely that he had a lymphoma causing panhypopit.
He should have a repeat MRI in [**4-13**] weeks and follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**] (neuro-oncologist) to make sure no tumor appears.
Differential diagnosis included granulomatous dz conversion of 25VitD to 1,25VitD, paraneoplastic syndrome or bone mets (but no evidence of such on imaging).
25-OH vitD was normal and 1,25-OH vitD was low, which is not consistent with increased conversion from lymphoma/granulomatous dz.
Hypercalcemia resolved with IV hydration for hypernatremia.
# ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY ([**Last Name (un) **]): Patient's Cr was initially elevated to 1.5, likely mixed ATN/pre-renal process as patient was septic.
It was not felt that tumor lysis syndrome was contributing to this because he had a normal uric acid and LDH.
CHRONIC PROBLEMS BY ISSUE: .
# Hypertension (HTN): Patient was hypotensive in the ICU when coming out of a septic picture.
#Urethral bleeding:  Patient was catheterized early on transfer to the floor for DDAVP test and started to have mild urethral bleeding.
It was getting progressively worse, eventually turning into gross bleeding from urethra after urination.
Bleeding stopped with holding pressure.
Urology consultants felt this was likely foley trauma and after 3-5days it healed without intervention.
# Pulmonary Nodules:  Patient had CT chest that showed diffuse and partly clustered micronodules with tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] distribution, as well as airway wall thickening and mild irregularities.
Unclear if this is infectious, inflammatory or malignant process.
Pulmonary consult believes it is a result of severe pneumonia patient states he had many decades ago.
# Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): Continued on home omeprazole.
# Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (BPH): continued on home finasteride 5mg daily.
He has been stable on desmopressin 0.05 mg PO at night - Please check hematocrit, calcium, and creatinine at follow-up to ensure that these are remaining normal - He should have a repeat MRI in [**4-13**] weeks and follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**] (neuro-oncologist) to make sure no tumor appears.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: Panhypopituitarism   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital because you were having low blood pressures and fevers--called sepsis.
We found that your lymphoma was obstructing the drainage of your gallbladder, causing bacteria from your gut to spill into your blood.
You were treated with antibiotics for the infection and a drain was placed in your gallbladder to open up the blockage.
Finally, you were found to have high sodium levels in your blood.
You will follow with an endocrinologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4160**], for your high sodium and hypopituitarism.
The following changes were made to your medications: START TAKING THE FOLLOWING MEDICATIONS:    - filgrastim 300 mcg every day for 10 days in between chemotherapy    - prednisone 10 mg daily    - desmopressin  0.05 mg at night, your dose might be adjusted by      Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4160**], his office will call you everyday    - lidocaine gel apply topically to drain every 24 hours under       dressing    - oxycodone 5 mg every 6 hours as needed for pain    - acyclovir 400 mg every 8 hours to prevent viral infections    - ciprofloxacin 500 mg daily until [**11-25**]    - metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours until [**11-25**].
