In [**2108-11-26**], he presented with acute worsening abdominal pain and peritonitis.
Radiological findings suggested large mass at the rectosigmoid junction adhering to the bladder wall causing cancerous colovesical fistula.
During the surgical exploration, colonoscopy was done which showed exophytic tumor w/ biopsy positive for invasive adenocarcinoma.
Further staging CT on [**2109-1-31**] revealed 2 lesions in the liver suggestive of metastatis.
RUQ ultrasound showed portal vein thrombosis and he was started and has completed coumadin.

Brief Hospital Course: 57yo M w/ metastatic rectal cancer presents with fatigue, diarrhea, and persistent hypoglycemia.
RECTAL CANCER: The majority of problems that the patient experienced while inpatient were thought to be due to advanced metastatic disease.
HYPOGLYCEMIA/Hyperglycemia - The patient was initially admitted with severe hypoglycemia that has now resolved.
The initial cause is likely a combination of decreased metabolism of insulin with possible infection (now resolved).
Pt was treated with antibiotics at first, but discontinued as pt was afebrile without localizing symptoms.
Then small doses of glargine were started, but pt began to have hypoglycemia and the lantus was discontinued.
Liver Failure: Pt with significant elevation of LFTs over last weeks which was likely due to invasive process with cancer.
Pt likely with progression of liver disease as a result of liver metastases.
- RUQ u/s showed echogenic liver consistent with history of multiple hepatic metastasis.
No ductal dilation.
- LFT elevation limits opportunities for chemotherapy.
Renal failure- pt has increasing BUN, creatinine.
Likely hepatorenal syndrome and due to metastatic disease.
Thrush: pt continues to have oral symptoms.
He has had increasing swelling while inpatient.
He had some relief with spironolactone.
