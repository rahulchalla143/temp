Over the week prior to presentation, he said that he would get short of breath walking approximately 400 yards.
1-2 days prior to presentation he noticed that he would have chest pain and breathing would become more painful when he would lie on his back.
He denied dizzyness, lightheadedness, vision changes, LOC, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, difficulty urinaring, change in bowel or bladder habits, or lower extremity edema.
Most recently he has come back from [**Country 3396**] in mid [**Month (only) 956**] - he had travelled into rural areas during the trip but denied any illnesses during or after.
He presented to an OSH on [**9-28**] and was noted to be tachycardic and anemic with non-specific EKG changes.
An ECHO done on [**9-30**] showed an EF >55%, mild LVH, and a 4-5cm circumferential pericardial effusion, respiratory variation R+L ventricle, and R atrial collapse.
Anemia - recently diagnosed 3.
Tachycardia 4.
Chronic shoulder pain - no trauma history  Social History: The patient has worked in construction for many years but retired in [**7-18**] ("it's a young man's job").
Family History: Father - [**Name (NI) **] cancer Sister - [**Name (NI) **] cancer  Physical Exam: On admission to CCU: Vitals: T 99.4, P 115, BP 129/91, MAP 104, RR 23-26, 95-96% RA Gen: pleasant, middle aged man, reclining in bed, NAD HEENT: PERRL, MMM, OP clear, no jaundice Neck: No JVD CV: tachycardic, regular, 2/6 systolic murmur at LLSB Lungs: clear on anterior exam Abd: soft, distended, +BS, ?hepatomegaly, R groin soft, no bruit Ext: w/wp, no edema, strong pulses.
Left shoulder: denies current pain, no pain with palpation, full ROM, [**5-19**] strenth with internal and external rotation.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not stenotic.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a large pericardial effusion.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
There is sustained right atrial collapse, consistent with low filling pressures or very early tamponade.
There is left atrial collapse.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
888 cc of bloody fluid was aspirated and sent for cytology, chemistry and microscopy.
Hemodynamics after the pericardiocentesis showed resolution of the tamponade physiology.
Echocardiogram done after the pericardiocentesis showed a small pericardial effusion with no echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
Pericardial tamponade.
There is a small residual posterior pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
A round extrinsic mass (approximately 3 cm in diameter) abutting and compressing the right atrium is now seen  Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2190-10-1**], most of the fluid in the pericardial sac has been removed.
An extrinsic mass compressing the right atrium is now seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 1.Cardiovascular -- Pericardial Effusion: patient presented with SOB, exercise intolerance, and nonspecific systemic sx including fevers, chills, sweats, and weight loss.
He presented to an OSH and was found to be anemic and tachycardic, with non specific EKG changes.
An ECHO showed a collapsing RA concerning for tmponande, and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for pericardiocentesis.
888cc bloody fluid sent for analysis, patient subjectively much improved after tap.
Etiology: metastatic vs. infectious (TB, HIV, other viral) vs. hypothyroid vs. mediastinal radiation (XRT for [**Month/Year (2) 499**] CA?).
Cytology was negative for malignancy.
-- Rate/Rhythm: sinus tachycardia - question of possibly [**2-15**] anemia - received 1 unit of blood, fluid boluses without change; may be secondary to RA mass (compensatory for decreased in flow) -- Mass: 3cm extrinsic mass compressing RA - ?etiology - chest CT to better visualize in AM once drain is removed.
Respiratory: good oxygen saturations on room air; CXR - no evidence of metastatic disease; long smoking hx - COPD - nebs PRN 3.
Multiple liver lesions on CT.  Liver bx [**10-7**] showed multiple necrotic metastases.
Musculoskeletal: left shoulder pain worse than basline shoulder pain and only on L - possibly referred from cardiac mass.
Zolpidem Tartrate 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for sleep.
Disp:*60 Tablet Sustained Release 12HR(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: metatstatic cancer pericardial effusion   Discharge Condition: improved - no [**Last Name (un) 7186**] of breath, shoulder pain well controlled  Discharge Instructions: Call your doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7186**] of breath, chest pain, worsening abd pain, depression, anything that concerns you.
