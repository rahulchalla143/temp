No f/cp/palp/n/v/d/abd pain/sob/wheeze but chronic cough and episodes hemoptysis.
Other ROS + chills, depression related to acute illness.
Pt had been hospitalized [**Date range (1) 27024**] after presenting with fever after recently having been discharged from hospital for paraspinous abscess s/p tx with Abx with vanco and levaquin.
Had also c/o neck pain, found to have pseudomonal UTI but no other source of fever; imaging showed fluid collection at L3-4 and stable cervical spine dz; cervical lesion through to be either neoplastic vs abscess.
She persistently spiked, extensive ID, rheum and malig w/u with the following results: [**Doctor First Name **] weakly positive; CRP elev 298; pleural-based nodules s/p VATS neg for malignancy or infection including AFB/fungal; BAL neg x some [**Female First Name (un) **]; numerous neg bcx; stool neg c-diff; LP neg cytology and other studies nl (prot 55, gluc 34, no cells); bone scan pos.
Eventually underwent lami for tissue dx epidural mass - was negative for malig, afb or fungus.
Hosp course also sig for pseudogout (crystals on tap); neck pain with fluid collection at site of IND prev admission for paraspinous abscess, improved by end of hosp on vanco; tremor->MRI brain rec by neuro, found 2.5 cm meningioma R parietal, no mets, no explanation for tremor x possible metabolic derangement; hemoptysis and chronic cough (vats neg for malig), ARF thought some prerenal; anemia requiring several transfusions; yeast infection; elev TSH thought related to time of dosing per endocrine.
Stable on coumadin, and dm and htn were under control at time.
Improved at rehab and was sent home on [**Holiday **]; returned to rehab for anemia sx, transfused and sent home the following wednesday.
Also had numerous tiny well-circumscribed nodules, of unclr etiology, but with one that  on last CT was enlarging (in LUL), was supposed to go for bronch  vs transthoracic bx but did not f/u.
DM x 30 years with peripheral neuropathy 7.
HTN 8.
PVD- Fem-ant/tib bypass on L in [**2099**] on coumadin since then presumably for low flow state; no hx dvt's or pe's, no hx afib 10.

Able to relate history without difficulty.
There was no apraxia.
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light bilaterally, and visual fields intact to confrontation bilaterally with no hemineglect.
No ptosis is noted, and on fundoscopic exam discs were hard to visualize.
Palate and uvula elevate at midline.
Tongue protrudes in midline, with no fasciculations.

PATIENT REEXAMINED AT 5:45PM FOR ACUTE CHANGE IN MS (last seen at 5:30PM): -pt now unresponsive to voice and sternal rub; finally awoke to deep sternal rub and could raise hand on command, open eyes but did not stay awake unless stimulated.
Poor R wave progression, cannot rule out old anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Loss of R waves in leads III and aVF, consider old inferior wall myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2110-11-12**] loss of R waves in lead aVF is new.
MRI with contrast [**1-4**] FINDINGS: Again seen are numerous intraparenchymal enhancing masses with associated hemorrhage.
These are compatible with the clinical impression of metastatic disease.
Note that a large right frontal extra-axial lesion most likely represents a meningioma.
The extra-axial lesion appears approximately stable since the MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**2110-9-25**].
The intraparenchymal lesions are new since that time, but appeared stable since the study of [**2111-1-3**].
A preliminary report was issued that read "Multiple hemorrhagic enhancing metastases are again seen, with variable amounts of surrounding edema.
CONCLUSION: Numerous hemorrhagic enhancing intraparenchymal masses compatible with the clinical impression of metastatic disease.
Extra-axial lesion at the right vertex likely representing a meningioma.
Since the prior examinations, there have been development of numerous well-circumscribed rounded lesions of increased attenuation seen scattered throughout both frontal and temporal lobes.
The largest two lesions are in the left frontal lobe measuring approximately 10 x 12 mm and in the right temporal lobe measuring 12 x 9 mm.
There is no subdural or subarachnoid hemorrhage seen.
There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.
Interval development of numerous hyperdense lesions within both frontal and temporal lobes.
The differential for this is hemorrhagic metastases or traumatic contusion.
The appearances are suggestive of hemorrhagic metastasis.
2nd CT brain [**1-3**]: There has been no change in the appearance of innumerable bilateral hemorrhagic lesions, likely hemorrhagic metastases.
The extent of surrounding vasogenic edema within the left frontoparietal and right temporal lobes is also unchanged.
There is no new intracranial hemorrhage.
CT TORSO: FINDINGS: Images of the lower thorax again demonstrate nodular thickening of the left pleura which is slightly increased since the prior exam of [**2110-10-16**].
Interstitial thickening is present in the left base which was also seen previously and is slightly more prominent on the current exam.
Again visualized is a left subpulmonic fluid collection measuring 7.0 x 8.6 x 7.8 cm.
It is predominantly low density with iso and hyperdense material present within it.
No associated rib lesions are present.
Again noted is a 2.2 x 2.7 cm nodule in the right adrenal gland which was seen on the recent MRI at which time it likely represented an adenoma.
There is no abdominal lymphadenopathy.
There is no evidence of intra-abdominal hemorrhage.
A nodule is present in the subcutaneous soft tissues of the anterior abdominal wall which measures 1.4 cm in diameter.
There are no dilated bowel loops.
CT PELVIS FINDINGS: There is free fluid in the dependent position of the pelvis.
The urinary bladder is well distended and contains gas likely related to the patient's Foley catheter.
There are no dilated bowel loops in the pelvis.
Graft material is seen in the left external iliac artery.
Bone windows demonstrate degenerative changes in the spine.
No blastic or lytic lesions are present.
Stable appearance of a left subpulmonic fluid collection representing either an abscess or hematoma.
No dense material present within the abdomen on the current examination to suggest hemorrhage.
Nodular thickening involving the left pleura and interstitial thickening involving the left base likely representing metastatic disease slightly worse since the previous exam.
The pericardium is slightly thickened on the current exam as well but not significantly changed since the prior exam.
A soft tissue nodule in the right hemipelvis likely represent an ovary.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo woman with dm, htn, past malignancies including RCC and thyroid ca, and recent w/u with negative path for malignancy but concerning bone scan, mult known pulm nodules, adrenal nodule, who p/w right weak hand and left facial droop, multiple areas of hemorrhage on ct with no substantial edema or effacement of the grey-white jxn, no midline shift, vents open.
Initial exam showed left facial droop and right arm weakness; however, several hours after being in the ED, (hours after being given 10 mg IV decadron and 1.5g IV dilantin) she became unresponsive.
Could have recurrence of RCC, which can met to brain and bleed, versus new lung cancer versus new malignancy of other source versus recurrence of her thyroid cancer.
Infection, autoimmune still possibilities, but less likely given pattern of lesions, and hemorrhagic component.
WBC was initially elevated with negative UA (except RBC's), CXR with no change.
She was managed on an insulin sliding scale, and given protonix and pneumoboots for prophylaxis.
She was extubated within 24 hours with no recurrence of seizure activity and return to her pre-mental status change state, with some improvement of strength in the hand and facial droop.
CEA and rad-onc consult, bx pelvic lesion by surgery (not reachable per interv.rads); rad onc aware.
Pelvic nodule is really an ovary, not a mass, so can't be bx'ed.
CEA mildly elevated- unhelpful in differentiating lung from renal cell.
No complaints.
Continued RUE weakness ([**4-29**]).
CT neck/chest today with increased pleural thickening and nodularity.
[**1-8**]:  AVSS w/ increased WBC to 32 likely secondary to steroids.
FNA of abdominal wall mass.
[**1-9**]: AVSS with increased WBC to 34.
No complaints.
Percutaneous biopsy of pleura performed without complication.
[**Date range (1) 27026**]:  No XRT.
[**1-11**] patient experienced [**9-3**] chest pain relieved with nitorglycerin.
No ECG changes.
Patient NPO for possible open biopsy today.
[**1-13**]: AVSS with BP controlled.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Metastatic non small cell carcinoma 2.
Anemia   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: 1.
