Admission Date:  [**2125-4-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**2125-4-10**]  Date of Birth:   [**2051-8-20**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73 year old female with a history of colon cancer who was admitted to an outside hospital on [**2125-4-7**] with diarrhea, hypokalemia and severe dehydration.
The patient started vomiting last night, vomited this morning, and was subsequently found to have decreased responsiveness.
An arterial blood gas performed after intubation at the outside hospital revealed a severe acidosis, predominantly metabolic and less respiratory, with a serum bicarbonate of 9.
This is likely secondary to her profound diarrhea, and possibly an aspiration event.
A chest x-ray done after intubation showed evolving bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent with aspiration, and possibly evolving adult respiratory distress syndrome.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Lungs:  course breath sounds throughout, with poor air movement throughout.
This is a case of an unfortunate female who suffered acute respiratory decompensation, secondary to an aspiration event this morning, causing hypoxemia, hypercarbia, with a concomitant profound metabolic acidosis secondary to prolonged diarrhea.
The patient was doing very poorly upon transfer over here, with worsening ventilation, oxygenation and persistent metabolic acidosis despite maximal ventilatory support and an attempt at correction of her metabolic acidosis.
The family, mainly her daughter [**Name (NI) 501**] who is her healthcare proxy, desired for the patient to receive no cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and no defibrillation for resuscitation.
The family stated that they wanted no heroic efforts.
At 6:03 p.m., the patient became asystolic on telemetry with undetectable oxygen saturations.
At this point, on examining the patient, the pupils were fixed and dilated and the patient was unresponsive to sternal rubs.
There were no audible spontaneous respirations or heart sounds.
