There is significant mass effect on the neighboring structures, resulting in a 17-mm leftward shift of the septum pellucidum.
In addition, there is a subdural component of the hematoma at the right frontal convexity, best seen in image 3:12.
There is a rightward subfalcine and uncal herniation present.
The left lateral ventricle is moderately dilated, concerning for early hydrocephalus.
There is mild effacement of the quadrigeminal cistern, concerning for downward transtentorial herniation.
There is fullness at the level of the foramen magnum, concerning for early tonsillar herniation.
There are no acute fractures.
There is mild mucosal thickening of the ethmoid sinuses and mild mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus.
Remaining included portions of the paranasal sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION: Large right parietooccipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage with adjacent subdural component overlying the right frontal convexity, with extension into and effacement of the right lateral ventricle.
There is leftward subfalcine herniation, right-sided uncal herniation, and early downward transtentorial herniation.
CT HEAD [**2146-10-24**] A large focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered in the right occipital and parietal lobes is redemonstrated.
Consequent mass effect to this larger area is redemonstrated, with a 15 mm left shift of the septum pellucidum, in comparison with a 17 mm shift, seen previously.
The subdural hemorrhage overlying the right frontal lobe described previously is now decreased in size and visible as subdural hypodensity.
There is no new intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no evidence of cerebellar tonsillar herniation.
There is no fracture.
IMPRESSION: Redemonstration of large right parietooccipital hemorrhage with surrounding edema and extensive mass effect, the degree of which appears essentially unchanged from the comparison study.
The associated intraventricular and right subdural hemorrhage have apparently resolved, with no new hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: # Intracranial hemmorhage with severe headache.
Exam was notable for left sided visual field deficit on confrontation, pronator drift on the left, and an inability for eyes to cross midline to the left.
She still complained of severe headache.
Attempts were made to transition her to sublingual concentrated morphine solution, but pain was inadeqautely controlled requiring additional IV morphine.
On [**10-24**] she was noted to again be somnolent, difficult to arouse, her dexamethasone was re-increased, a head CT was re-checked which showed no increased or new bleeding.
She was seen by neurology and chronic pain, who recomended restarting her decadron as well as eventually setting on the following regimen.
Our suggested taper would be long (10 days), with low threshold to go back up in the face of worsening neurologic symptoms.
H/O ASD with paradoxical emboli: After much back and forth Ms. [**Known lastname 1557**] and her family decided against closing her ASD at this time.
Nutrition h/o short gut with ileostomy, [**Location (un) **] On arrival to the floor, nutrition services was consulted and patient was started on total parenteral nutrition.
History of paradoxical emboli.
History of Klebsiella Bacteremia.
# VTE Prophylaxis: Given intracranial hemmorhage, pneumoboots were used for VTE prophylaxis.
To be instilled into central catheter port for local dwell.
Morphine 10 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: Twenty (20) mg PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for migraine.
If headache returns or worsens significantly would contact neuro and slow taper.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7665**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Intracranial hemorrhage   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable and afebrile with decreasing neurological deficits of left sided visual field deficits.
You continued to improve greatly and at current only have some visual deficits from your bleed.
The following changes were made to your medications:  Please return to the ED if you have - slurred speech, dont feel your thinking is clear, have persistent fever higher than 101, new weakness or any other signs concerning to you.
