CTA revealed posterior consolidations bilaterally most consistent with pneumonia.
Per ICU attending there, his imaging/presentation did not seem consistent with PCP and serum LDH was normal at 230.
Of note, his nasal swabs at [**Hospital3 417**] tested positive for MRSA and VRE.
Upon review of OMR, he was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2103-4-13**] to [**2103-4-18**] for AMS and a positive blood culture.
Urine cultures from [**Year/Month/Day **] was positive for ESBL Klebsiella and pseudomonas resistant to meropenem.
Repeat urine culture showed no growth.
Portable chest X-ray showed no evidence of pneumonia.
His mental status and clinical condition improved with antibiotics and fluids in the ICU.
Vancomycin was discontinued (given patient had only 1 out of 4 bottles positive for coag-positive staph at [**Year/Month/Day **], with negative blood culture here).
On the floor here, he reports "a lot" of abdominal pain over the past four days and continued pain in both of his legs.
He also states that his shortness of breath is improved compared to a few days ago.
Review of Systems: (+) Per HPI (-) He denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
He denies visual changes, headache, dizziness, sinus tenderness, neck stiffness, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat or dysphagia.
There is no dysuria, urinary frequency.
He denies arthralgias or myalgias.
There is no increasing lower extremity swelling.
There is no numbness/tingling or muscle weakness in extremities.
There is no feelings of depression or anxiety.

Compared to [**2103-3-26**] MR, there is no suspicous interval change to suggest recurrence, and no evidence of acute pathology.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
The right temporal tumor site and posttreatment changes are better evaluated on the head MRI from [**2103-5-28**].
EEG [**2103-5-30**] IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal extended routine EEG, due to the presence of continuous 0.5-1 Hz delta slowing seen over the right fronto-temporal region with rare associated sharp discharges (F4/T4).
This is consistent with a focal underlying structural lesion with epileptogenic potential.
In addition, the presence of a disorganized [**6-19**] Hz theta frequency background is suggestive of a mild diffuse encephalopathy, seen with medication effect, metabolic disturbance, or infection.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 13013**] is a 56-year-old man with glioblastoma, s/p resection and chemo-irradiation, and most recently on bevacizumab and dexamethasone as well as history of PCP PNA and PE Bilat DVTs admitted to OSH ICU for bilateral PNA.
His hospitalization was complicated by confusion related to sedating medications.
OSH imaging suggestive of bibasilar atelectasis and consolidation.
Induced sputum was negative for PJP.
(2) Seizure Disorder:  Patient suffered seizure and cardiac arrest [**11/2102**] and has been on valproic acid since.
Patient developed worsening confusion [**5-26**] and given recently decreased VPA dose, concern was raised for non-convulsive seizures, 20 min EEG was obtained and showed no epileptiform discharges and only diffuse encephalopathy which had been seen on previous EEGs.
On [**2103-5-29**], patient had possible convulsive seizure witnessed by shaking of L>R extremities and patient was given 1mg Ativan however shaking had resolved prior to medication administration.
Head CT was obtained which was negative for acute hemorrhage.
A 24-hour EEG showed epileptiform discharges however the findings were relatively subtle and unlikely to cause convulsive seizure activity.
No further shaking episodes were observed.
(3) Altered Mental Status:  Patient was noted to be lethargic on [**2103-5-29**], with noted jerking movements of his upper extremities bilaterally.
Differential for this included underlying glioblastoma multiforme, question of seizure activity, infection and medications with sedative properties.
He underwent lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis, CSF culture was negative and cell count was not suggestive of meningitis.
(4) Sepsis:  On [**2103-5-29**], patient developed hypothermia and hypotension to SBP 90's.
(5) Diarrhea:  On admission, patient was having [**1-15**] loose bowel movements daily, and abdominal pain was attributed to enteritis.
He appeared distended on [**2103-5-29**] and a plan film of the abdomen showed no evidence of obstruciton or megacolon.
Diarrhea is attributed to antibiotic therapy with secondary effect on GI flora.
(6) Gliobastoma/Seizure Disorder:  Patient s/p resection with intracranial chemo and s/p VP shunt.
Course complicated by intracranial hemorrhage x 3.
MRI shows stable disease however concern was raised for progression of glioblastoma that cannot be seen on MRI.
(7) Headahce:  Following removal of oxycodone and morphine for pain control, patient complained of intermittant headaches.
His neurological examination remained unchanged and there was low suspicion for acute intracranial process.
Headaches were believed to have a component of rebound following withdraw of opiates.
Gabapentin 300 Q noon added [**2103-6-7**], could increase to 600 Q noon if headaches worsen.
(8) Acute Renal Failure:  Patient developed acute renal failure related to vancomycin.
(10) History of DVT/PE:  This was diagnosed in [**11/2102**] with bilateral PE and patient has IVC filter in place, not systemically anticoagulated due to history of intracranial bleeding x 3.
(11) Macrocytic Anemia:  This is likely related to chemotherapeutic agents.
(12) Thrombocytopenia:  His platelets trended up form low 100's at OSH likely medication effect from chemotherapeutic agents.
(13) Osteoporosis:  This is related to chronic dexamethasone therapy.
He has a history of compression fractures.

We treated you with antibiotics and your symptoms improved.
Your primary oncologist, Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 724**] noted that you seemed confused and was concerned that you were having a seizure, we performed an EEG which did not show anything to explain the confusion.
You were having diarrhea and we checked you for an infectious cause and the tests were negative.
