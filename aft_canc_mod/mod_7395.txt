Admission Date:  [**2117-3-5**]       Discharge Date:  [**2117-3-12**]   Service:  MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is an 86 year old male with a history of prostate cancer, laryngeal cancer and lymphoma, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35%, who was admitted with a distal left femur fracture status post mechanical fall.
He denies syncopal symptoms.
No shortness of breath, no chest pain, no lightheadedness, no seizure activity, no tongue biting or loss of bowel or bladder dysfunction.
He was reaching for an object, rotated and fell on his left leg which subsequently resulted in a left femur fracture.
He has no complaints of left leg pain.
Prostate cancer status post XRT.
Laryngeal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma status post laryngectomy.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35%.
Status post bilateral hernia repairs.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Positive stoma; no erythema, no secretions, no bruits.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm with a III/VI systolic murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla.
Able to move his left foot without difficulty.
Chest x-ray showed an enlarged left ventricle, tortuous aorta.
No consolidation, no effusion or pneumonia.
Left femur was a comminuted spiral fracture of the distal left femur with posterior medial displacement of the proximal fragment.
The hip showed no fracture of the proximal left femur.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 4334**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] Medicine Service on [**2117-3-5**] for primary work-up and treatment of a left femur fracture status post a mechanical fall.
Left femur fracture and cardiovascular clearance:  Mr. [**Known lastname 4334**] was admitted to the Medicine Service for preoperative cardiac clearance for his left femur fracture surgery.
His outpatient Cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] was consulted and recommended the patient be ruled out for a myocardial infarction with serial CKs.
This was done overnight without any acute rise in his cardiac enzymes.
In addition, the patient had a Persantine thallium done which showed mild to moderate partially reversible perfusion defect in the inferior wall which is more apparent when compared to his prior study.
He had a left open reduction and internal fixation of his femur performed on [**2117-3-9**], that was performed well without any complications.
The patient was noted to have a drop in his hematocrit from 36 to 29 in the setting of the operation which was felt secondary to blood loss during the operation.
There were no acute signs of gastrointestinal bleeding or blood loss post surgery.
He was seen by Physical Therapy who recommended rehabilitation and the patient will be transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for extensive rehabilitation after discharge from the hospital.
Aspiration pneumonia:  On hospital day two, the patient was noted to have vomiting and aspiration.
The patient was lying in bed flat because of his left leg fracture and was noted to have an emesis of bright yellow material, presumably bilious and/or vanilla pudding.
He was suctioned; however, then noted to have increasing oxygen requirement and his blood pressure dropped to approximately 70 to 80 systolic overnight.
It was thought to be evidence of aspiration pneumonia and he was continued on Levofloxacin and Flagyl times seven days.
Genitourinary:  The patient was noted to have urinary tract infection secondary to Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus during the hospitalization.
This was noted to occur after he had his orthopedic surgery and it was felt best to treat this with a seven-day course of Vancomycin since the patient has hardware after surgery.
He had no symptoms of urinary tract infection and we will check a urinalysis and urine culture after he has completed the Vancomycin course.
He will continue his antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia and Vancomycin there and will acutely rehabilitate after his left femur fracture before being transferred home and resume care under his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus urinary tract infection.
Aspiration pneumonia.
