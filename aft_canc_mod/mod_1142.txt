Patient also described abd pain as well.
An hour later, patient became hypotensive to 95/46.
DKA was thought to be perhaps due to infection and patient was pan cultured.
Vanc, Levo, & Flagyl were started, as patient has PCN allergy.
CXR was obtained which showed bilat opacities c/w pna.
An abd CT was performed as well as patient was complaining of abd pain, but was essentially negative, did show inguinal hernia.
Patient's cardiac enzymes were checked as well and were found to be elevated at 0.83.
EKG revealed sinus tachy @100 with normal axis, normal intervals, new ST depressions in lat leads.
Unclear if sedation due to medications given in ED or if this was how nursing home found patient.
Rpt EKG showed resolution of lateral ST depression but new TWI in V3 but rpt enzymes show trop elevation to 2.97 with MB 80s and MBI 6.6.
Type I diabetes on an insulin pump 3.
Family History: Father had a question of coronary artery disease and had a pacemaker and died at the age of 81.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity.
Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.
AORTA: Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild (1+) MR. TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild PA systolic hypertension.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild septal hypokinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Dilated right ventricle with mild systolic dysfunction.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2140-10-6**] 10:49 AM IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the bilateral lower extremities.
Head CT [**10-5**]-IMPRESSION: Chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
[**10-5**]:CT abd/pelvis IMPRESSION: 1.
No evidence for mesenteric ischemia.
Bilateral lower lobe consolidations, left more than right, consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
Small amount of ascites and gallbladder wall edema, consistent with third spacing, possibly related to vigorous fluid resuscitation.
Left inguinal hernia containing ascites.
There are low lung volumes.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 y/o male with a history of DM1 on an insulin pump last A1c 8.1, hypertension and glaucoma who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis, NSTEMI, and pneumonia.
#Diabetetic Ketoacidosis: The potential causes include pneumonia, NSTEMI, or potentially malfunctioning insulin pump.
NSTEMI: The patient was found to have new EKG changes with elevation in troponin, peaking at 5.21.
TTE showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD.
The etiology of his MI was either secondary to hypoperfusion in setting of pneumonia/sepsis OR he had a primary cardiac event.
The decision was made to not pursue cardiac catheterization given high probability he would have multivessel disease and the patient was not interested in bypass surgery.
#Pneumonia: He was found to have bilateral lower lobe consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics for health care acquired pneumonia given that he is a nursing home resident.
His respiratory status has improved significantly,  he has been afebrile, and his leukocytosis  has resolved as well.
#Altered mental status/encephalopathy- This was likely due to toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, which was likely multifactorial in the setting of infection, NSTEMI, DKA.
Pt was treated for infection.
#Acute kidney injury: His elevated creatinine on admission was thought to be due to pre-renal etiology, likely volume depletion in the setting of infection.
#Thrombocytosis-likely reactive thrombocytosis due to recent infection and DKA.

Discharge Instructions: You were sent from your assisted-living facility for elevated blood sugars.
Initially, you admitted to the ICU and found to have diabetic ketoacidosis, pneumonia and a heart attack.
For your diabetic ketoacidosis you were followed by the [**Last Name (un) **] service, given insulin, and your symptoms improved.
