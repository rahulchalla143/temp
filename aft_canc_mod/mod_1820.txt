He has had an indwelling pleural catheter, which was used to drain his pleural space q3 days and has previously had a negative work up for metastasis, who then underwent six cycles of carboplatin and Taxol, which was completed one week ago.
He felt well until the day prior to admission when he developed mild dyspnea, malaise and a productive cough with green sputum.
He had a routine visit in the oncology clinic on the day prior to admission for blood work and administration of Aranesp.
Later that evening the patient checked his temperature and it was 101, so he went to the ER and was found to have a temperature of 102.5.
He does have numbness and paresthesias of his hands and feet, which started at the time of initiating chemotherapy.

Although the chest x-ray did not show signs of an infiltrate the right sided effusion could have been obscuring a pneumonia on the right.

Pulmonary:  The patient had pneumonia as stated above.
He also had an increasing effusion in his right lung.
The initial pleural fluid studies were not consistent with empyema.
Heme:  The patient was noted to have an elevated PT and PTT, his fibrinogen level was elevated, so it was felt that this was likely secondary to a vitamin K deficiency.
