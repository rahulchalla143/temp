Complicated by bleeding from mass in ampulla of Vater requiring EGD cauterization.
He presents to the ER today with CC of fever and chills for two days as well as 1 day of coffee ground emesis and weakness.
Per OMR notes he has had recent transfusion-dependent anemia from suspected upper GI source - pt states last transfused about 2w ago.
CXR revealed bilateral nodules and masses and a possible retrocardiac opacity.
NG lavage revealed coffee ground return.
A R IJ line was placed and was adjusted after CXR showed poor positioning.

Again seen are pleural opacities along the right pleural surface, and nodular opacities within the right upper lobe, corresponding to the patient's history of known metastatic nodules.
Additionally, there are bilateral pleural effusions and an area of opacity at the right lung base which may represent associated atelectasis and/or consolidation.
There is an area of opacity in the left lung base, which may represent an area of pleural thickening or atelectasis, though there is limited evaluation secondary to motion.
No definite pneumothorax is seen.
Again seen are findings from the patient's known history of metastatic malignancy, including areas of pleural opacity and thickening within the right hemithorax.
Right pleural effusion and associated opacity which may represent volume loss and/or consolidation.
Area of opacity in the left lower lobe which is not well evaluated secondary to respiratory motion.
CT ABDOMEN:  Within the visualized lung bases, there are bilateral pleural effusions with enhancing pleural metastases.
Adjacent compressive atelectasis is also evident, greater on the right.
Numerous parenchymal nodules are identified.
There is no significant intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.
Multiple low attenuation lesions are identified scattered throughout the liver.
A small amount of perihepatic fluid is identified, new from the previous examination.
The pancreatic head is enlarged, and a mass is identified within the pancreatic tail.
There is soft tissue within the porta hepatis.
A 1 cm right adrenal nodule is again identified.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.
Note is made of small retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
Free fluid is identified within the pelvis, which is of increased attenuation, and likely hemorrhagic.
There is no evidence of colonic obstruction.
There are multiple osseous metastases noted within the left femoral head, right iliac crest, left L3 vertebral body.
Other than a small increase in perihepatic fluid, there has been no appreciable change compared to the [**2128-10-29**] examination.
Widespread metastatic disease.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The lung bases show interval progression of both parenchymal and pleural-based nodules, consistent with metastatic disease.
There are bilateral low-density pleural effusions with adjacent areas of opacity most likely to represent atelectasis.
Numerous metastases in the liver were much better demonstrated on the recent ultrasound from [**2128-10-25**].
There is a new percutaneous biliary drain extending into the right lobe of the liver and terminating in the duodenum.
There is interval improvement in the degree of intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Ill-defined abnormal soft tissue is present in the hepatic hilum.
A large mass in the head of the pancreas is perhaps minimally increased in size, now measuring 6.2 x 4.8 cm in axial dimensions, compared to 5.9 x 4.8 cm previously.
A further mid body metastasis which is new is seen also.
A stent in the distal common bile duct is in an unchanged position.
There is a new stent in the duodenum since the prior study with partial opacification by contrast in its proximal course, although not distally.
There is a new small right adrenal nodule of 10 mm in diameter raising concern for metastatic disease.
A left-sided renal cyst is unchanged.A new left sided retroperitoneal; deposit is seen-represewnting progressive mets.
There is a small rim of high-density ascites about the liver anteriorly.
There are multiple small retroperitoneal lymph nodes, not meeting size criteria for pathological enlargement.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a small-to-moderate amount of high- density ascites, up to 40 Hounsfield units in the lower pelvis, most consistent with recent hemorrhage, probably related to recent percutaneous drain placement.
There is sigmoid diverticulosis, without diverticulitis.
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: There is a new lytic lesion in the left femoral head.
In fact, there are increased lucencies in both femoral heads.
There is also a new soft tissue mass along the right iliac crest with bony destruction, measuring 2.8 x 2.0 cm in axial dimensions, new since the prior study.
There is also a new soft tissue mass with bony destruction along the posterior aspect of the left L3 vertebral body, also new since the prior study.
Status post placement of percutaneous biliary catheter and duodenal stent.
Progressive metastatic disease, including new osseous metastases, progressive lung nodules, and perhaps slightly increased size of pancreatic mass.
Bone metastases include a small mass in L3 with slight posterior extension into the spinal canal.
It is doubtful that this lesion produces mass effect on the spinal cord at present, although posterior extension into the canal may become a consideration later if it were to become larger.
No evidence of obstruction, with free distal passage of contrast.
Cholangiogram demonstrating intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation as well as dilation of the common bile duct; contrast extended into the duodenum.
Sludge and debris were seen within the common bile duct.
A common bile duct as well as a duodenal stent were in situ.
Approximately 30 mL of dark brown bile and sanguinous material were extracted during the procedure.
Duodenoscope could not be negotiated past a reported extrinsic stenosis of the post-bulbar duodenum.
Subsequent image shows deployment of an incompletely expanded metallic stent across the stenosis.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
More significantly, there has been blossoming of diffuse hepatic metastatic disease with very extensive progression since the CT scan.
There is also mild-to-moderate dilatation of the common hepatic and intrahepatic bile ducts, despite the presence of biliary stent.
Brief Hospital Course: # Acute blood loss anemia: from GI bleeding - coffee ground emesis/[**Last Name (un) 15557**]:  with most likely source is bowel invasion of tumor given pt's history.
The patient also had hemoperitoneum which could be from tumor bleeding which was slightly increased on a subsequent CT.
# acute cholangitis - due to VRE - on culture from the bile.
# C diff colitis - during the course in the hospital, pt developed C diff diarrhea that was treated with flagyl.
# Pulmonay metastasis - caused intermittent hemoptysis.
Was possibly due to bone marrow invasion by tumor.
also has DM, hypothyroidism - medically managed.
During the ast few days, the patient developed severe hypotension, tachycardia and severe abdminal pain.
