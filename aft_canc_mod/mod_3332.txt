He got - CT Chest [**4-23**]: this was a screening high res CT scan (part of clinical trial and showed a 4x4 left hilar mass.
- His wife also noted recent changes in mental status changes with word-finding difficulties, able to recognize objects but lost the ability to read, write.
- CT Brain at OSH showed left parietal lesion - Bronch at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**5-13**]: Cytology suspicious for small cell lung cancer - Brain MRI [**5-14**]: ring-enhancing mass lesion on the left occipital lobe; lesion associated with vasogenic edema; no significant midline shift demonstrated.
Mild mass effect is noted on the left occipital ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**] - CT Abd/Pelvis [**5-15**]: Numerous hepatic metastases involving all lobes of the liver.
Lytic lesion within the left femoral head and left acetabulum - RadOnc: recommended Decardon - Neurosurg: Likely Stereotactic biopsy of mass later in week - Onc: chemo to likely start on [**5-16**] in AM   Past Medical History: Past Medical History: s/p MI with stent COPD s/p left upper extremity sympathectomy s/p hernia repair anemia   Social History: 100 pack yrs of smoking.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Gen: comfrotable, communicating very well, AOx3 HEENT: PERLA, no LAD palpable CVS: RRR, no murmurs Resp: decreased breath sounds, course breath sounds on left Abd: voluntary guarding, distended, non-tender Ext: 1+ edema up to knees, no rashes; righ shoulder and hand twiched consistently throughout visit   Pertinent Results: AMDISSION LABS: Chem7: [**2120-5-13**] 04:55PM   GLUCOSE-136* UREA N-28* CREAT-1.4* SODIUM-143 POTASSIUM-5.8* CHLORIDE-103 TOTAL CO2-35* ANION GAP-11 [**2120-5-13**] 04:55PM   CALCIUM-9.1 PHOSPHATE-3.4 MAGNESIUM-2.7* .
CT Chest [**4-23**]: this was a screening high res CT scan (part of clinical trial and showed a 4x4 left hilar mass.
- CT Brain at OSH showed left parietal lesion .
- Brain MRI [**5-14**]: ring-enhancing mass lesion on the left occipital lobe; lesion associated with vasogenic edema; no significant midline shift demonstrated.
Mild mass effect is noted on the left occipital ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**] .
Lytic lesion within the left femoral head and left acetabulum Echo: ([**5-13**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferolateral akinesis, inferior and inferoseptal hypokinesis.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
No major valvular abnormalities seen.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
EEG: IMPRESSION: This is a moderately abnormal EEG due to the presence of a  slow background with multifocal slow transients; this pattern is most consistent with a mild to moderate encephalopathy or other process involving both hemispheres equally.
No epileptiform features were seen.
Pathology: Tissue specimen: (Lung) Left main bronchus, endobronchial biopsy:  Poorly differentiated carcinoma, consistent with small cell carcinoma; see note.
Large left sided pleural effusion.
Small right sided pleural effusion.
Large left hilar mass with resultant bronchial obstruction.
Large right paratracheal lymph node with mass effect on the SVC.
On [**2120-5-19**], he developed worsening mental status and was intubated for hypoxemia.
There was also concern for compression of the SVC by a large right paratracheal lymph node, likley contributing to his hypotension and pressor-dependence.
It was felt he was fully competent to make the decision to become CMO, and the family felt this would be consistent with his prior wishes given the progression of the tumor and its effects.
