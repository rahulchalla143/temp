HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is an 83 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease status post left anterior descending stent requiring LGIB, status post history of arteriovenous malformation, colon cancer status post colectomy and ileocolonic anastomosis.
He presents with black stools and lightheadedness times three days.
The patient was complaining of minor lightheadedness, however, declined any shortness of breath, chest pain or abdominal pain.
Gastrointestinal was consulted and recommended tagged red blood cell scan and subsequent esophagogastroduodenoscopy if the patient became hemodynamically unstable again.
Coronary artery disease.
Three plus mitral regurgitation and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy seen on echocardiogram on present admission.
Multiple arteriovenous malformations with 15 year history of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Duke's A colon cancer status post right hemicolectomy in [**2176**].
Jejunal lipoma in [**2176**].
History of hemolysis previously in transfusion.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Mother with cerebrovascular accident at 67; lung cancer at 87.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Upon review of systems, the patient notes shortness of breath times two days; melena at least once a month.
Pulmonary examination was clear to auscultation bilaterally with good breath sounds; no evidence of wheezing or crackles.
On cardiac examination:  Demonstrated a holosystolic murmur V/VI, loudest at the apex.
Regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2 within normal limits; no gallops or rubs.
No hepatosplenomegaly appreciated.
No costovertebral angle tenderness.
Extremities well perfused with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Dorsalis pedis two plus bilaterally.
No focal abnormalities were evident on neurological examination.
On [**2188-2-15**], the patient underwent enteroscopy which demonstrated polyps in the stomach body and fundus, blood in the duodenum and proximal jejunum.
No angiomas were seen at that time; otherwise enteroscopy was normal.
The Gastrointestinal tagged red blood cell study on [**2188-2-14**], had demonstrated very small amounts of gastrointestinal bleeding in the left upper quadrant, probably within the small bowel.
When the patient's hematocrit fell to 28, he often became symptomatic complaining of either lightheadedness, substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, or minimal shortness of breath.
The first episode of substernal chest pain without radiation, the patient was placed on continuous Telemetry and ruled out for myocardial infarction.
On a separate occasion, the patient became very tachycardic and his heart rate was ranging between the 110s and 120s.
He was symptomatic as well, complaining of chest pain with radiation down the left arm, shortness of breath and diaphoresis.
On a separate occasion when the patient's hematocrit was 28.1, he was being evaluated by Physical Therapy and walked approximately five feet before feeling lightheadedness and extremely diaphoretic.
The episodes of drop in hematocrit often coincided with melanotic stools, usually ranging from 150 to 200 cc with no obvious signs of bright red blood but being darkly melanotic.
As well, there was diverticula in the second part of the duodenum; otherwise showing normal ampulla with clear bile seen from its orifice.
Because of dropping hematocrits and recurrent melanotic stools, the patient also underwent a pill study on [**2188-2-22**] which demonstrated some fresh blood and active bleeding from arteriovenous malformations in the proximal small bowel.
Impressions of the study demonstrated erythema and nodularity in the antrum compatible with gastritis, angiectasias in the proximal jejunum at 1 meter.
The patient's hematocrits were relatively stable for the next couple of days with no melanotic stools reported; however on [**2188-2-26**], the patient experienced one melanotic stool around 05:30 a.m.
He stated that he felt some reflux and knew that something was wrong because this was an unusual symptom for him.
As well, he became very diaphoretic with minimal shortness of breath and felt very lightheaded.
He denied chest pain and abdominal pain.
EKG demonstrated T wave inversions and ST depressions in V3 through V5, although difficult for comparison because his EKG at baseline is abnormal.
The patient denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, and the decision was made to transfer the patient to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he could be more closely observed.
