The patient had consistent and mental status changes with fever and hypotension for one week prior to admission.
He also had a [**12-15**] day history of purulent drainage from his lumbar incision.

Chest x-ray showed no pneumothorax, no infiltrate.
Head CT was negative for masses, bleeds or bone destruction.
Lumbar CT showed no epidural abscess or collection in the soft tissue.
LABORATORY DATA:  CT of the lumbar spine again showed no abscess but some gas in the soft tissue.
Wound culture came back positive for gram-negative rods, enterococcus and Staphylococcus aureus.
Blood cultures, 1out of 6, came back positive with gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
MRI of the lumbar spine showed large fluid collection posterior to the L4-L5 laminectomy site consistent with pseudomeningocele, and an abnormal single .................. At the L4-L5 level which could be consistent with osteomyelitis.
