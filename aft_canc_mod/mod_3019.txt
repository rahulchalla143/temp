Admission Date:  [**2177-6-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2177-7-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2116-2-28**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HEPATOBILIARY  SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 61-year-old previously healthy female, who presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital on [**6-21**] complaining of right upper quadrant pain and nausea worsening over two weeks.
The right upper quadrant pain described as being dull, unrelenting.
Laboratory studies at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital were within normal limits except for elevated alkaline phosphatase of 722 and T bilirubin of 7.2 and direct bilirubin of 4.3.
There was evidence of ductal dilatation.
ERCP was initially attempted, but was aborted because patient became bradycardic.
MRCP done at [**Hospital3 **] showed marked dilatation at the intrahepatic and hepatic ducts bilaterally due to confluence with tapered narrowing.
Pancreatic and peripancreatic edema was also noted.
ERCP done, subsequent MRCP showed dilatation but the point of stricture was now visualized.
CT scan done at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital showed no mass near the extrahepatic duct and no mass at the head of the pancreas.
Intrahepatic duct filled with contrast.
On admission, the patient was afebrile at 96.7, tachycardic with a pulse rate of 100, blood pressure 100/60, respiratory rate of 18, 97% O2 saturation on room air.
Cardiac exam was tachycardic, rate and rhythm regular, S1, S2, no murmurs.
Lung examinations are clear to auscultation bilaterally, without any crackles, wheezes, or rhonchi.
Abdominal examination was significant for tenderness of the right upper quadrant and left upper quadrant and periumbilical area without any rebound and without any guarding.
Abdomen was soft and nondistended, and had bowel sounds.
There was no peripheral edema noted at the time.
A few hours after admission to [**Hospital1 **], the patient was complaining of nausea and vomiting, and had vomited coffee-ground like vomitus.
The bile culture and the blood culture also came back with Klebsiella oxytoca and Serratia marcescens, which both were pansensitive.
EGD showed blood in the stomach and two erosions in the second part of the duodenum.
Patient underwent emergent decompression of biliary system by PTCA and drainage, which showed a mild stricture of the common bile duct and the common hepatic duct with dilatation at the distal ducts.
After receiving the right PTC tube, the patient became tachycardic and hypertensive, and received volume resuscitation, and was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.
Hemoclip was applied with bleeding that was stopped at one site, but a secondary site was still bleeding.
On hospital day seven, the patient underwent left sided PTC and drainage without any complication, and continued to recover on the floor.
CT scan of the abdomen showed minimal stranding around the pancreas.
Patient went to the operating room on hospital day three, underwent open cholecystectomy, common bile duct exploration, or choledochoscopy, Roux-en-Y side-to-side hepaticojejunostomy, and biopsy of the porta hepatis area.
During the operation, the patient was found to have thickened gallbladder wall with mid common bile duct stricture, hardening of the pancreas.
There was severe fibrosis of the porta and contracted duodenum densely draining into the porta and the pancreas.
Frozen section biopsy of the fibrous tissue around the porta hepatis came back positive for malignant cells, and cystic and a common bile duct node were also positive.
The final pathology came back with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder with full thickness involvement and positive cystic ductal margins, the common bile duct and cystic duct were also found to have adenocarcinoma cells.
Bile cultures on hospital day 18, postoperative day five came back with Cipro resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens, which was resistant to tobramycin and intermediate resistant to gentamicin.
Postoperative day 15, patient underwent upper GI with small bowel follow-through which showed a near total gastric outlet obstruction and EGD study showed mucosal edema of the proximal part of the second part of the duodenum.
Adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder with involvement of the cystic duct, bile duct.
Septic shock.
