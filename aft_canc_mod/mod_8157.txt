**FINAL REPORT [**2148-4-6**]**     MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2148-4-6**]):    No MRSA isolated.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 51305**] was seen in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2148-3-27**] where he was found to have an infected wound bed with an overlying bolster still in place.
The following day, on [**2148-3-28**] he was taken to the operating room for removal of his bolster, wound washout and debridement.
He had excellent preservation of function of his CN VII and CN V. There was mild erythema overlying the anterior portion of his wound.
The wound culture grew out pan-sensitive Serratia.
Twice per day dressing changes were then begun on Post Op Day (POD) 1 with wet-to-dry gauze.
This helped considerably to continue gentle debridement of the area and to preserve the underlying healthy tissue.
Neuro: Pain was controlled using combination of oxycodone PO and Dilaudid IV.
The patient did not have any significant problems with pain.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.

POD#1: Patient was intubated, sedated on propofol and fentanyl drips.
Patient was noted to have some left upper extremity swelling and there was concern for possible DVT.
A venous doppler study was negative for thrombus.
Patient's pain was controlled with combination of tylenol, oxycodone, oxycontin and dilaudid.
Flap checks remained stable and pain well controlled.
At the time of discharge on POD#6, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
There was a dependent area of swelling about the mid-temple area.
