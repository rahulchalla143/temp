Admission Date:  [**2136-9-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-9-10**]   Service: MED  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**] Chief Complaint: MS changes  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of melanoma skin who is being transferred from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 4 days PTA when she began to experience increasing confusion.
She presented to the ED on [**9-1**] at which time a head CT showed 3 discrete masses, two within the left parietal lobe and one in the left frontal lobe, with surrounding hemorrhage, most consistent with metastatic neoplasm or possibly infection.
The patient was diagnosed with melanoma in 12/99, at which time three lesions, the largest 4.5mm in diameter, were each resected with clean margins.
One of the lesions showed in situ melanoma, while the other two showed invasive melanoma of unclassified type.
After resection she had no recurrence of the melanoma.
Past Medical History: h/o melanoma - resection 6 years ago.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Vitals: temp: 97.7 HR: 85 BP: 105/70 RR: 20 O2sat: 96%RA Gen: in NAD HEENT: PERRLA, EOMI, no sceral icterus.
Neck: supple, no lymphadenopathy.
No wheezes or crackles Abd: S/NT/ND.
Skin: + multiple melanocytic papules on back, several >2 cm in size.
Pertinent Results: Head CT: Multiple high density lesions identified within the left parietal and left frontal lobe, with surrouding edema and mass effect seen associated wtih the left parietal lobe lesions.
These findings are most suggestive of hemorrhagic metastatic disease.
There is no shift of midline structures and no hydrocephalus.
CXR: Left lower lobe opacity.
This could be due to focal "round" pneumonia, aspiration, or a discrete lung mass.
Again demonstrated are three hemorrhagic lesions suggesting metastases in the left cerebral hemisphere.
Chest CT: 1) 3 cm mass in the left lower lobe associated with peripheral patchy consolidations and ground-glass, which can represent primary lung cancer with obstructive pneumonia or metastasis with hemorrhagic changes.
2) Low-density mass posterior to the left kidney, which could represent renal cell carcinoma, metastasis, or exophytic renal cyst.
Decreased mental status possibly brain massess complicated by hyponatremia given acute presentation of MS changes.
Likely that brain lesions have been there for awhile.
Started Keppra [**9-5**] for seizure prophylaxis given hemorrhagic mets.
CT chest shows likely pulmonary source for mets to brain.
Patient also had melanoma resected in [**2131**] with reported negative margins.
Hyponatremia - presented with mixed picture of likely lasix-induced salt wasting as well as some component of SIADH.
AFib: Echo r/o'd LV thrombus as source for possible emboli to brain.
Pt is not a candidate for anticoagulation given fall risk and hemorrhagic brain metastases.
developed infection at site of IV in left antecubital fossa.
This should also cover potential UTI with gram+ cocci as indicated on prior urine culture.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 2716**] [**Last Name (un) **] - [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic lung cancer.
