Admission Date:  [**2179-4-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-4-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2116-12-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3227**] Chief Complaint: L-Sided weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2179-4-23**]: Right Crani for Mass resection/decompression (Radiation Necrosis)   History of Present Illness: Patient is a 62M known to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for metastatic melanoma to the brain.
During the last office visit at the BTC, it was recommended that open craniotomy be pursued to decompress intracranial lesion.
Imaging there revealed a punctate right thalamic hemorrhage, however significant sub falcine herniation and sulcal effacement.
Given these findings, and his newly resultant left hemiplegia and neglect, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for definitive care per the family's request.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements are with defect to the left lateral gaze (CN6) V, VII: Facial there is a left facial droop.
XII: Tongue is somewhat atonic on the left side though without gross deviation.
EXAM ON DISCHARGE: The patient has continued left facial droop, left tongue deviation, left hemineglect.
New right uncal herniation, with effacement of the right perimesencephalic cistern and mass effect on the right cerebral peduncle.
Effacement of the right cerebral sulci and mass effect on the right lateral ventricle is likely unchanged from MRI [**2179-3-20**].
New punctate subcortical white matter hyperdense foci, which may be hemorrhage, measuring up to 8 mm.
Hyperdense 6 mm right frontal lesion, difficult to determine whether this is a new finding from MRI [**2176-3-19**].
Extensive white matter hypoattenuation consistent with edema/radiation effect, likely similar to MRI, [**2179-3-20**], allowing for differences in technique.
Four new enhancing lesions, as described above, with marked "blooming" artifact consistent with blood products, melanin or both, with stability size and appearance of the dominant enhancing lesion and interval decrease in size of the adjacent "satellite" lesion.
Findings are consistent with mixed-response to treatment.
Persistent confluent FLAIR-hyperintensity extending to, but not including, the subcortical U-fibers with persistent mass effect and decreased shift of the normally midline structures; the appearance is consistent with radiation toxicity.
No acute infarction  MRI Head [**4-24**]: 1.
Status post very recent right frontal craniotomy with resection of the dominant mass superficially located in the right frontal lobe; however, there is persistent band-like enhancement at the posterior and caudal margin of the resection cavity, highly suspicious for residual tumor.
At least four small enhancing foci with marked "blooming" susceptibility artifact in the right frontal corona radiata and forceps minor, as described, also unchanged and likely representing metastases.
No definite hemorrhage or acute infarction elsewhere in the brain  CT Head [**4-28**]: 1.
Apparent increase in the fluid-filled surgical cavity, with new dependent hyperdensity consistent with hemorrhage.
MRI revealed a region of contrast enhancement in the right frontal lobe and extensive surrounding edema.
The preliminary pathology report was positive for radiation necrosis.
He had an MRI on [**4-24**] which revealed persistent VG edema, but no new hemorrhage or infarct.
Medications on Admission: Initial medications: Dexamethasone 6 mg IV Q6H, LeVETiracetam 1000 mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **], Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5 mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **], Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg PO/NG DAILY, Lisinopril 20 mg PO/NG DAILY, Polyethylene Glycol 17 g PO/NG DAILY:PRN, Senna 1 TAB PO/NG [**Hospital1 **]:PRN, Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID, Insulin SC Sliding Scale, Glucagon 1 mg IM Q15MIN:PRN hypoglycemia protocol, Dextrose 50% 12.5 gm IV PRN hypoglycemia protocol, Famotidine 20 mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Medications: 1.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.
-An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.
Loss of vision, either partial or total.
Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.
Severe sensitivity to light.
Severe headache or change in headache.
Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
New onset of seizure or change in seizure, or seizure from which you wake up confused.
Due to the complexity of neurosurgical procedures and treatment of neurosurgical problems, effective advice regarding emergency situations cannot be given over the telephone.
Should you have a situation which is not life-threatening, but you feel needs addressing before normal office hours or on the weekend, please present to the local emergency room, where the physician there will evaluate you and contact us if needed.
