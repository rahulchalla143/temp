Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an 81-year-old female status post fall and hip fracture about a week ago, after which she had been placed on lovenox for prophylaxis, and subsequently developed an acute on subacute and chronic subdural hematoma with significant midline shift and mass effect.
However, in the ED following the dilantin load, she became hypotensive to the 70s/40s and lethargic with progression to unresponsiveness.
Postoperatively, her exam waxed and waned, and her poor respiratory function and hypoxia prevented extubation.
A CTPA was negative for pulmonary embolism.
