Admission Date:  [**2200-7-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2200-8-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2139-3-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: adhesive tape / tolvaptan  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: Hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Tonsil biopsy ([**7-16**]) Chemotherapy port placement ([**7-19**])   History of Present Illness: 61 year old male with history of NASH cirrhosis who is on the transplant list, with ascites complicated by diuretics limited due to hyponatremia, s/p TIPS on [**5-14**] who was recently admitted to the hospital for peritonsillar mass s/p biopsy on [**7-16**] (discharged [**7-17**]), readmitted to the SICU on [**2200-7-18**] with oropharyngeal bleeding.
He woke up the morning of admission and began coughing up small amounts of bright red blood and clots.
ENT packed his oropharynx and he was scoped by ENT twice without signs of active bleeding.
Clot was visualized consistent with recent biopsy.
IR embolization was not pursued out of concern for necrosis of the tongue.
He remained in the ICU as his hematocrit was not appropriately bumping for days, however no active bleeding was ever seen.
Per SICU resident, patient has not had melanotic stools.
Packing was removed on [**7-20**] without signs of further bleeding.
He was extubated on [**7-22**] and his VS remained stable with one episode of afib during his SICU course, which converted out of with IV metoprolol.
He and his family are aware of the diagnosis and that he will not currently be listed for a liver transplant.
Feels tired, but otherwise without complaints.
Past Medical History: -Decompensated Cirrhosis with ascites secondary to NASH, c/b ascites responsive to diuretics but developed hyponatremia -s/p TIPS on [**5-14**] for management of ascites -hyponatremia -Bilateral cataract repair.
-Incisional hernia repair.
-History of sigmoid resection over 20 years ago due to diverticulitis.
Family History: Negative for liver disease or liver cancer.
No GI cancer in his family  Physical Exam: TRANSFER PHYSICAL EXAM VITALS: 98.2 120/70 78 22 94% 4L GENERAL: No acute distress, alert HEENT: OP with large right tonsilar mass.
LYMPHATICS: No cervical, supraclavicular, or axillary lymphadenopathy or inguinal adenopathy appreciated.
decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally ABDOMEN: distended ascitic abdomen without tenderness EXTREMITIES: warm, well perfused , 3+ edema NEURO: cranial nerves II-XII grossly intact.
Mass noted paratonsilar with no active bleeding NECK: No JVD CARDIAC: RRR with no m/r/g LUNGS: CTA b/l no w/r/r.
Dullness to percussion over dependent areas but tympanic anteriorly.
No HSM or tenderness appreciated.
Midline vertical scar s/p sigmoidectomy EXTREMITIES: [**12-16**]+ pitting edema b/l (much improved over past few days).
Warm and well perfused, no clubbing or cyanosis.
Note: Sections are of squamous mucosa with underlying dense submucosal lymphoid infiltrates with focal necrosis, hemorrhage and crush artifact.
The infiltrate is diffuse and comprised of large cells with moderate amount of eosinophilic to foamy cytoplasm, round to irregular vesicular nuclei, and dispersed chromatin.
There are numerous apoptotic bodies and occasional mitotic figures.
Small lymphocytes are also admixed, but constitute only a minority of the cells in the sections.
Although the proliferation fraction is extremely high and lymphoma cells lack BCL-2 staining, the morphological features do not suggest Burkitt lymphoma and are more in keeping with high grade diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
IMAGING ======= CT CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST ([**7-25**]) HISTORY:  61-year-old male with cirrhosis, awaiting liver transplant, now found to have B-cell lymphoma on the lateral aspect of the tongue, now in need of staging.
There is no axillary or hilar lymphadenopathy.
Multiple prominent lymph nodes are seen in the mediastinum and in the paratracheal station measuring 9 mm (2:16), and 10 mm in the short axis (2:22), in the aortopulmonary window measuring 8 mm in its short axis (2:24) and in the subcarinal station measuring 16 mm in a short axis (2:28).
Calcified coronary artery disease is present.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Bilateral large nonhemorrhagic effusions are present with associated atelectasis resulting in near-complete collapse of the bilateral lower lobes.
The remaining aerated upper and right middle lobes demonstrate emphysematous changes without masses or nodules.
Dependent edema is present in the left upper lobe (2:22).
Hypodensity in the right lobe of the liver is not changed since prior exam and measures 10 mm (2:60); an additional hypodensity in the left lobe of the liver measures 10 mm, and is unchanged from prior exam (2:57).
These previously were shown to represent cysts at MRI.
A 2.0 cm (2:50) lesion in segment II anteriorly is hypodense on the delayed phase of imaging provided, and cannot be fully evaluated on a single phase examination.
The gallbladder shows no stones or wall edema.
An 11 mm splenule is present just inferior to the splenic hilum (2:71).
The pancreas is somewhat atrophic, but shows no masses.
The kidneys enhance with and excrete contrast symmetrically; bilateral hypodensities in the bilateral mid pole is too small to characterize, but likely represent cysts.
The large and small bowel shows no evidence of obstruction.
No lymphadenopathy or free air is present.
A large amount of nonhemorrhagic ascites is seen.
The aorta demonstrates aneurysmal dilatation in its infrarenal portion, measuring 5 cm in diameter in the axial plane (2:83), similar to slight increased from prior exam.
Additionally, there is aneurysmal dilatation of the right common iliac artery up to 28 mm in diameter and the left common iliac artery measuring 21 mm in diameter (2:100), similar to slightly increased compared to prior exam.
The bladder, there is small amount of layering excreted contrast within it as well as a focus of gas in the antidependent portion, likely the result of recent catheterization, although a gas-producing infection cannot be entirely excluded.
No lymphadenopathy is seen.
BONES:  No aggressive-appearing lytic or sclerotic lesions are present.
An old right postero-lateral 8th rib fracture is present.
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy as described above.
No abdominal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
Large bilateral non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions with associated atelectasis; emphysema.
2.0 cm lesion in segment II anteriorly is hypodense on the single delayed phase image provided and cannot be fully characterized.
Recommend multiphasic CT or MRI as clinically indicated.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm, 5 cm, and aneurysmal dilatation of the bilateral common iliac arteries, similar to slightly increased from prior exam.
Locule of gas within the bladder, likely sequelae of recent catheterization, although if no recent catheterization then infection cannot be excluded; correlate with history.

and new diagnosis of Non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma, now off the liver transplant list, who presented one day after being discharged following peripharyngeal biopsy with hemoptysis.
No signs of active bleeding.
Large pleural effusions seen on CT scan.
New oxygen requirement while on BMT service with oxygen saturations in low 90s, but without dyspnea.
Patients anasarca much improved with increased diuretics and on discharge, his dosage was decreased and told to have his electrolytes checked as an outpatient and his diuretics titrated by his PCP or hepatologist.
#) TONSILAR NON-HODGKIN B-CELL LYMPHOMA: Currently no respiratory compromise or dysphagia.
PET CT showed disease localized to tonsil, but suspicious mediastinal lymphadenopathy seen.
Bone marrow biopsy deferred due to coagulopathy.
#) NASH CIRRHOSIS, c/b recurrent ascites: s/p TIPS [**5-14**] and TIPS redo [**2200-7-3**] (no intervention required at that time).
He is no longer on the liver transplant list given his diagnosis of lymphoma.
Last EGD in [**2200-5-16**] showed erosive esophagitis/duodenitis with grade 1 esophageal varices and portal gastropathy.
We continued his home bactrim SS Qday for SBP ppx.
Lactulose titrated to 3-4BM daily to prevent hepatic encephalopathy.
Possibly starting nadolol for variceal bleed prophylaxis.
#) UTI: Patient does not clearly have UTI given lack of symptoms prior and negative UA.
CHRONIC ISSUES ============== #) DIABETES MELLITUS: Controlled on metformin at home.
At home, he was on 20mg Lasix prn for weight gain which he rarely took.
He was discharged on 20mg Lasix and Spironolactone 50mg and told to have electrolytes checked prior to his Tuesday Hem/Onc appointment.
His diuretics should be changed based on his electrolytes, fluid status, and kidney status by his PCP or hepatologist.
#) Cirrhosis with mass seen in liver: Patient should follow up with his hepatologist to discuss the results of the MRI to evaluate the mass seen on abdominal CT.  #) B Cell Lymphoma: Patient to follow up with Hem/Onc on Tuesday [**8-5**] to receive chemotherapy and radiation.

You were admitted for a mass in your tonsil that was unfortunately found to be lymphoma.
The biopsy of your tonsil was complicated by bleeding requiring blood products, but you were stabilized and transferred to the oncology floor.
Because of your liver disease, you became volume overloaded, so we increased your water pills to remove excess fluid which helped your breathing.
