There was no associated fall or trauma.
Was reportedly aphasic and weak in the right upper extremity initially, but these deficits resolved at some point as noted in the OSH records.
It is not known at this time if she was receiving CPR for cardiac arrest or respiratory arrest.
CT at OSH showed Intracranial hemorhhage.
Undocumented, but according to son, has history of "golf-ball sized" meningioma in the left part of brain.
No spontaneous movements.
No spontaneous movements.
Tone moderately rigid in bilateral upper extremities.
No Adventitious movements.
Admission CT Head: CT OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  A large left frontoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage is again noted.
There is questionable minimal increase in prominence of the caudal portion of the hemorrhage in comparison with the examination of several hours earlier.
The degree of hypodensity surrounding the inferior portion of the hemorrhage also appears minimally increased, consistent with slight increase in edema.
There is no hydrocephalus or evidence of transtentorial herniation.
Bilateral cerebral periventricular white matter hypodensity is consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic change.
There is no evidence of extra-axial hemorrhage.
Bone windows demonstrate no evidence of fracture within the surrounding osseous structures.
The mastoid air cells and visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses are normally pneumatized.
IMPRESSION:  Left frontoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, questionably minimally increased along its caudal aspect, without change in degree of mass effect.
No fracture or malalignment seen.
Extensive degenerative disc disease as well as multilevel DJD.
No change in degree of mass effect .
EEG [**6-30**]: ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording there were frequent bursts of mixed frequency slowing with a generalized distribution.
There were also occasional bursts of bitemporal mixed frequency slowing.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the bursts of generalized slowing with additional bitemporal mixed frequency slowing.
These findings suggest multifocal subcortical abnormalities.
Vascular disease is a relatively common cause of such findings.
There were no areas of prominent and  persistent focal slowing, and there were no clear epileptiform features.
No evidence of acute DVT.
Evidence of prior DVT of the left popliteal vein.
MRI/MRA Brain: FINDINGS:  As noted on the prior CT, there is an acute 4 cm left  frontoparietal intraparenchymal hematoma.
There is a small amount of subdural blood present over the anterior left temporal lobe.
There is mass effect upon the atrium of the ipsilateral lateral ventricle.
However, there is no significant midline shift or herniation.
There are no additional foci of abnormal magnetic susceptibility to indicate other microhemorrhages.
There are multiple T2 hyperintensities within the subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres due to chronic microvascular infarct.
There is no slow diffusion to indicate an acute infarct.
IMPRESSION:  Large intraparenchymal left frontoparietal acute hematoma with a tiny amount of subdural blood along the left middle cranial fossa.
There is no evidence of other microhemorrhages.
No acute infarct.
Chronic microvascular infarct.
There were no clear epileptiform discharges seen throughout the recording.
The right hemisphere is mildly disorganized but reaches normal alpha frequency ranges.
There was a continuous widespread QRS complex seen.
AUTOMATIC SEIZURE DETECTIONS: There were no entries in these files.
All entries represent movement and muscle artifact.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal discontinuous 24-hour long term EEG monitoring due to the presence of continuous slowing over the mixed delta and theta frequency range over the entire left hemisphere.
There were no clear epileptiform discharges or seizure activity recorded.
A widespread QRS complex was noted.
EEG [**7-4**]: TIME SAMPLES: Throughout the recording, there is a persistent moderate voltage slowing in the [**11-30**] Hz delta frequency range and intermittent theta frequency slowing over the entire left hemisphere with left temporal emphasis.
As the study progressed, there are initially isolated sharp features over the left temporal region with phase  reversing around T3 and runs of semi-rhythmic 5 Hz theta frequency slowing in the left central region lasting up to 20 seconds.
Beginning in the early evening of the recording, there are frequent semi-rhythmic sharp and slow wave and spike slow wave discharges seen phase reversing around F7 and T3, secondarily spreading over the entire left hemisphere.
There was no clear seizure activity recorded.
There were also a few sharp wave discharges over the left temporal region captured.
There are prolonged widespread QRS complexes alternating with normal QRS complexes seen.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal 24-hour discontinuous EEG telemetry due to the presence of prolonged epileptiform sharp and spike slow wave discharges seen over the left fronto-temporal region spreading over the entire left hemisphere.
Additionally, there is continuous delta frequency slowing over the entire left hemisphere.
This finding suggests cortical and subcortical structural abnormalities.
Over the 24-hour EEG recording, there are described discharges over the left hemisphere which became more frequent and persistent but there were no clear seizures recorded.
EEG [**7-8**]: ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording, there are intermittent  bicentral sharp slowing seen independently occasionally followed by a slow wave.
ABNORMALITY #2: There is increased voltage gradient over the entire left hemisphere with a diffuse mixed theta and delta frequency slowing.
There is no clear anterior-posterior voltage gradient on both hemispheres.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of intermittent, independent, bicentral sharp slowing and sharp slow wave discharges and due to slow and disorganized background rhythms with diffuse theta frequency slowing and increased voltage gradient over the entire left hemisphere.
The background slowing suggests cortical/ subcortical dysfunctions and a mild encephalopathy.
Epileptiform  discharges represent most likely cortical dysfunction in central  parietal regions.
Superimposed fast activity is most likely due to medication effect.
CT Head [**7-8**]: Comparison with the prior study of [**2151-7-1**], reveals reduction in the density of the large hemorrhage, but negligible change in its degree of mass effect or surrounding edema.
Once again, there is considerable compression of the posterior aspect of the body of the left lateral ventricle as well as the atrium.
No new area of intracranial hemorrhage is identified.
There is moderate mucosal thickening within the posterior aspect of the left ethmoid sinus, which has evolved since the prior study.
TTE [**7-9**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the mid antero-septum, distal LV and apex.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
However, she did receive narcotics at the OSH and was found to have UTI on admission both of which could account for a change in neurological status.
Failed multiple bedside swallow exams and was NPO with NG in place.
failed a repeat bedside swallow evaluation.
Vitals were all initially stable with tachycardia, but became hypotensive in post-ictal period.
Dilantin discontinued as she had cyanotic fingertips which was presumably as a reaction to the Dilantin (purple glove syndrome).
Neuro exam on discharge was significant for diffuse mild L sided weakness ([**3-3**] in all muscles groups), trace movement of R ankle but 0/5 strength of all muscle groups on the right, and some inattention and perseveration, as well as problems following complex commands.
CVS: Cardiovascularly ruled out for MI with serial enzymes.
No significant events on Telemetry.
Ruled out again for MI with serial enzymes.
Had echo (please see results section) which showed mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the mid antero-septum, distal LV and apex, EF 35%.
She should have a repeat TTE when she is more medically stable to f/u these findings.
Extubated after 48 hours without complications.
GI: Failed multiple swallow evals and NG placed.
ID: Had UTI on admission which was treated with IV Levaquin for 7 days.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) Left frontoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage 2) Generalized tonic-clonic seizure   Discharge Condition: stable, tolerating medications   Discharge Instructions: 1) Please return for increasing weakness, trouble speaking, inability to take medications, uncontrolled bleeding, vomiting and fevers.
