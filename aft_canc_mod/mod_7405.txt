Admission Date:  [**2122-10-4**]       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2067-1-2**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55 year old female with a history of bilateral breast cancer, status post bilateral resection with positive bilateral lymph nodes (ER positive with infiltrating ductal/lobular carcinoma), status post Cytoxan and Adriamycin times four cycles, status post Taxol times one cycle.
Chemotherapy was complicated by decreased ejection fraction (unclear if this was secondary to Adriamycin or to ischemia).
Recent history significant for admission for hyponatremia over the last several months.
Recent history is also notable for difficulty breathing on Friday.
The patient complained of weakness and had slurred speech.
Her husband who is a physician was concerned that the patient may be experiencing hyponatremia as she has had similar episodes in the past.
Course in the Emergency Department was notable for recurrent hypoglycemia necessitating D50.
Head CT was done which was negative for hemorrhages or mass lesions.
Bilateral breast carcinoma, core biopsies consistent with infiltrating ductal/lobular carcinoma, grade I to II.
Right 1.3 centimeter infiltrating ductal carcinoma grade III with five out of twelve positive lymph nodes.
On the left, there was a 1.0 centimeter infiltrating ductal carcinoma grade II with three out of nine positive lymph nodes.
On [**2122-2-13**], the patient had one cycle of Taxol complicated by pulmonary edema.
On [**2122-2-14**], the patient was admitted to [**Hospital 2725**] Hospital with congestive heart failure and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and was started on Amiodarone.
On [**2122-2-16**], echocardiogram showed dilated left ventricle, akinesis of septum/apex, severe hypokinesis of lateral/posterior walls, ejection fraction of 20 to 25%, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation.
Left knee arthroplasty in 04/99.
Morphine and Codeine causes nausea and vomiting.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for carcinoma.
Father died at age [**Age over 90 **] of myocardial infarction, and mother died at age 50 of acute renal failure.
No tobacco and no ETOH.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient is lethargic and agitated.
Cardiovascular - regular, II/VI systolic murmur at the left sternal border.
Pulmonary - crackles at the bases bilaterally.
The abdomen revealed postsurgical scar.
Extremities revealed 2+ pitting edema to thighs.
Lymph - No axillary lymphadenopathy.
Chest x-ray revealed four chamber cardiomegaly and subsequent atelectasis at the left base.
Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm, left axis deviation, poor R wave progression, no ischemic changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, this is a 55 year old female with a past medical history of breast cancer, status post chemotherapy and radiation therapy who presented on [**2122-10-4**], with hypotension and delirium.
She is status post bilateral mastectomy with five out of twelve positive lymph nodes on the right and three out of nine positive lymph nodes on the left.
The patient had four cycles of Adriamycin and one cycle of Taxol which was complicated by pulmonary edema.
At that time, it was thought that the patient's congestive heart failure was secondary to Adriamycin resulting in an ejection fraction of 20%.
The patient did have wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram and was to have a cardiac catheterization planned for the future to rule out coronary artery disease, however, the patient has never had documented evidence of coronary artery disease in the past.
Since chemotherapy, the patient has had multiple admissions to outside hospitals for hyponatremia and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
She was noted by her family to be lethargic and somnolent.
The patient was originally admitted to the floor, however, she was hypotensive and was also found to have increased white blood cell count and 14% bandemia.
Urine culture was positive for pansensitive E. coli, however, no other source for sepsis was found.
Cardiovascular - Congestive heart failure - Atrial fibrillation -  The day after admission the patient was found to have a 20 beat run of what was thought to be ventricular tachycardia and then converted to a supraventricular tachycardia.
That evening, the patient converted to a wide complex tachycardia and was shocked several more times.
Electrophysiology felt that the patient had atrial fibrillation with aberrancy and was recommending continuing the Amiodarone drip.
There was also high suspicion of HIT antibody positivity in this patient even though the patient was not HIT positive by laboratory results.
On [**2122-10-19**], the patient converted to sinus spontaneously and then to atrial tachycardia with a 2:1 block.
Congestive heart failure - Soon after admission, because of hemodynamic instability and uncertainty of whether the patient was experiencing sepsis versus cardiogenic shock, a Swan was placed.
Repeat echocardiogram showed no tamponade, 4+ tricuspid regurgitation and 4+ mitral regurgitation with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%.
The patient was 24 liters positive and had severe anasarca.
The patient was extubated on [**2122-10-13**], but had to be reintubated due to respiratory distress.
The pleural effusions were consistent with exudates by LDH and had 700 to 1000 white blood cells.
However, the team felt that this was still consistent with congestive heart failure.
Renal - The patient presented with acute renal failure which improved after the patient's cardiac output improved.
Infectious disease - No source for the patient's sepsis was ever found and infectious disease was not convinced that the positive urine cultures could be responsible for the patient's septic physiology.
The patient was started on Vancomycin and Meropenem for empiric coverage.
CT of the abdomen was negative but could not definitively rule out cholecystitis.
The patient did have positive alpha streptococcus in the right pleural fluid but the Intensive Care Unit team felt that this was not a significant pathogen at the time.
Of note, the patient's lactic acidosis peaked at 9.0 and it was thought this was most likely due to a low flow state and hypoperfusion.
Gastrointestinal - The patient had increased bilirubin at 3.3 which was present on admission and slightly elevated ALT/AST which has been thought to be due to right sided failure.
Endocrine - The patient has hypothyroidism and was maintained on her outpatient Synthroid dose.
Psychiatry - As an outpatient, the patient has noted to be anxious and has been on low dose benzodiazepines, however, these benzodiazepines were avoided during her Intensive Care Unit stay due to her acute renal failure and mental status changes.
Vascular - The patient has distal extremity ischemia thought to be due to Levophed use.
Vascular surgery was consulted and agree that pressors were probably responsible for her distal ischemia.
They, however, recommended a Transesophageal Echocardiogram to rule out embolic event, however, the Medical Intensive Care Unit felt that the probability of emboli was low and a Transesophageal Echocardiogram was not performed.
