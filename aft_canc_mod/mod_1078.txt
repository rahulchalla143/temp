He is a 72M who is s/p (4th portion) for adenocarcinoid tumor (duodenal primary w Lung Mets) and CCY [**3-14**].
He was previously admitted for tumor recurrence in mediastinal nodes [**2-14**], and biliary obstruction.
However on the day following his discharge he felt lightheaded and had an experienced a fall due to weakness, without loosing consciousness.
He was transferred to SICU, where he temporally required pressors ( no intubation) and was treated with multiple antibiotics for sepsis, presuming his biliary system as the source of infection.
On the floor patient was intermittently hypotensive with poor renal and liver function.
On [**2177-5-4**] Patient presented with worsening cough and abdominal pain, and later increasingly hypoxic with O2 sats low 80s, 92% on NRB.
He subsequently developed worsening mental status.
CXR revealed total white out of left lung likely from fluid and collapse.
He was started on three pressors with no improvement in his hypotension as well as broad spectrum antibiotics.
Family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and informed of his morbid state.
His hospital course is broken down by systems:  Neuro His pain has been well controlled, however he developed new abdominal tenderness prior to transfer to the ICU which was treated with IV Dilaudid.
Given episodic hypotension he was also started on Octreotide TID and Albumin [**Hospital1 **] with good response.
He was v-paced without episodes of arrythmia.
He tolerated this procedure well without complication.
LFTs, T-[**Female First Name (un) 7925**] improved only mildly during the course.
During the course, his diet was slowly advanced as tolerated from clears, and he tolerated po's without nausea or vomiting.
Renal: pt developed acute renal failure, which was thought to be prerenal with possible HRS in he setting of poor liver function, as well as possible ATN in the setting of hypotension.
Renal was consulted and patient was treated with Midodrine/Octreotide/Albumin for HRS with improvement of renal function.
During the course pt was found to have UTI, and Zosyn was given renally dosed.
