Admission Date:  [**2138-1-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-1-16**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Lisinopril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**] Chief Complaint: Dizziness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PEG tube placement   History of Present Illness: 89 yo RH woman with AS, HTN who presents after fall last night.
She then fell on her rear without LOC or head injury.
She felt unwell with nausea and emesis, followed by generalized weakness.
She continued to have generalized weakness and nausea/emesis for which she was brought in to ED for further evaluation.
With fall and generalized weakness, CTH was obtained which demonstrated R frontal calcified mass (likely meningioma) and  neurology was consulted for further evaluation.
Patient now c/o L frontal dull HA.
After admit found to have a L facial droop.
The patient was unaware of a facial droop but reported that she had difficulty swallowing since yesterday evening.
She also noted seeing double when looking at the clock on the wall but denied diplopia otherwise.
She also denied dizziness, room spinning, nausea, HA, numbness, weakness or oscillopsia.
Pt taken urgently to CT and which showed a L cerebellar subacute infarct.
CN: pupils 2->1 mm bilaterally, EOMI but with L beating nystagmus with end gaze to the L. No diplopia in any position.
Decreased pin and temperature over the L side of the face in V1-3 with diminished corneals and nasal tickle on the L. L NLF flattening (even when teeth in place).
Able to turn head and shrug shoulders bilaterally as well.
Acute infarct in the left cerebellar hemisphere, extending into the left side of the medulla, with a short segment occlusion/ near-total of the lft distal vertebral artery in the V4 segment, as well as nonvisualization of the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery.
If further evaluation is necessary regarding the flow in the vertebral artery, CTA can be considered as there is some discrepancy in the flow pattern in the cervical vertebral artery between the 2D TOF and Gado MRA Neck.
3.0 x 3.5 cm extra-axial lesion in the right parietal region, representing a meningioma, but aggressive in appearance, with extension into the adjacent bone marrow.
Atherosclerotic disease involving the common carotid arteries and thecervical internal carotid arteries proximally on both sides with mild-moderate stenosis in the proximal cervical internal carotid artery, without flow limitation.
This was felt due to left vertebral artery occlusion, causing left-sided ataxia, left-sided Horner's, left facial loss of pain/temperature and right hemibody loss of pain/temp and dysphagia, the latter of which required PEG for feeding.
She was incidentally found to have large frontal meningioma.
She has had elevated BP's during the admission we have been working on getting better control.
Over the past 2 days she has had brief episodes of bradycardia while on the metoprolol, so we are holding today's doses and starting losartan.
- Holding for bradycardia 6.
