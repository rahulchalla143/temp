Patient otherwise completely asymptomatic and has been taking his coumadin dose as directed, no changes in diet, no recent nausea/vomiting/diarrhea or decreased PO intake.
CT head showed no acute process.
Past Medical History: - Cerebral palsy, wheelchair bound as of ~[**2130**] - History of PEs (bilateral in [**12/2134**], right subsegmental in [**8-/2138**]) on anticoagulation - A-flutter s/p cardioversion [**10-2**], on amiodarone and anticoagulated - HTN - Right heart failure with moderate Pulmonary hypertension, 2+ TR on TTE (but done in the setting of PE [**8-/2138**]) - Hypothyroidism - h/o recurrent MRSA cellulitis - Incontinence - Cervical spondylosis - Chronic back pain - Obesity - Hyperlipidemia - Chronic venous insufficiency - Depression - Open heart surgery at age 12, unknown type of repair (patent foramen ovale or ventricular septal defect?)
- Hematuria w/ atypical cells [**8-/2138**]  Social History: Apparently lives by himself with a "caretaker;" per d/c summary in [**2138**], could not perform ADLs.
NECK: Supple, no thyromegaly, no JVD, no carotid bruits.
ABDOMEN: Soft/NT/ND, no masses or HSM, no rebound/guarding.
SKIN: No rashes or lesions.
NEURO: Awake, A&Ox3, no focal deficits noted.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2139-10-4**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
No acute intracranial pathologic process.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
Similar marked global atrophy, with moderate chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  [**2139-10-10**] There are mild bibasilar atelectasis.
There are no focal hepatic lesions.
The gallbladder is slightly distended but there is no evidence of cholecystitis.
The adrenal glands are prominent bilaterally but no evidence of focal lesions.
There are scattered, non-pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
There are mild atherosclerotic calcifications of the abdominal aorta.
There is no free intraperitoneal fluid.
There is a large left rectus sheath hematoma which extends into the left extraperitoneal pelvic space.
The hematoma has a fluid-fluid level consistent with an acute on chronic component.
The urinary bladder is displaced posteriorly.
Additionally, there is subcutaneous stranding at the left flank overlying the left iliac crest, also representing a small amount of hematoma.
There is no evidence of active extravasation within the hematoma.
BONES: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.
IMPRESSION: Large left rectus sheath and left extraperitoneal acute on chronic hematoma as described above.
Supertherapeutic INR: After discussion with care givers and pharmacy, it is likely that this was an accidental overdose by caregivers.
[**Name (NI) **] was admitted with bleeding from peripheral IV site which was treated with compression.
Head CT was negative for acute hemorrhagic stroke.
Patient underwent ablation of inferior epigastric arteries, though no active rectus sheath bleeding was noted on IR.
Pneumonia: On hospital day 2, patient complained of cough productive of green sputum and later had fever to 100.9.
He was treated with levofloxacin for community acquired pneumonia and metronidazole for anaerobic coverage given aspiration risk.
Coverage for health care associated pneumonia was considered unnecessary and patient improved after 8 days of the above regimen.
He developed muscle strain related to coughing and was treated with acetaminophen, oxycodone and lidocaine patch.
Standing oxycodone was discontinued prior to discharge, but he required occasional oxycodone 5mg doses for breakthrough pain.
Ileus: On [**2139-10-8**] he had abdominal distention and worsening abdominal pain, plain film showed ileus.
He was treated with suppositories and bowel rest with improvment in abdominal pain and distention.
Rectus sheath hematoma: while coughing, patient developed abdominal pain related to muscle strain.
He was treated with oxycodone for pain with improvement.
On the evening of [**2139-10-9**] patient became hypotensive after a large bowel movement.
CT scan showed a large rectus sheath hematoma without evidence of active bleeding.
The hematoma resolved over the course of the rest of his stay.
# Recurrent pulmonary embolism: Patient has suffered two pulmonary emobli in [**2136**] and [**2138**] and had been on life long anticoagulation.
Lower extremitity ultrasound for DVT was performed and was very limited.
# EKG changes: admission EKG was remarkable for ST Depressions in V4-5 which appeared more prominent in comparison to EKG from [**2138-11-21**].
He complained of mild lower back pain which was considered unlikely to represent angina.
He ruled out for myocardial infarction by three sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
Serial EKGS showed persistence of ST Depressions in V4-5.
CHRONIC ISSUES ============== #.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES ============== # Prediabetic state: During this admission, the patient was noted to have consistently impaired fasting glucose (AM glucose between 100 and 125), and on several occasions his AM glucose was >125.
The patient is thus most likely in a pre-diabetic state.
Given his obesity, cerebral palsy, and other co-morbidities, lifestyle modifications may be difficult or impossible, and his primary care physician may consider [**Name9 (PRE) 44072**] him on a metformin regimen.
