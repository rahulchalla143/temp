She was treated with XRT cisplatin/etoposide and later presented with central airway obstruction and was referred here where she had a placement and removal of a silicone Y-stent, placement of 2 Ultraflex metal stents (one in distal trachea, one in R main stem bronchus), and argon plasma coagulation of tumor.
Since then she was reasonably well until [**2178-4-2**], when she had persistent dyspnea and prioductive cough.
She was been treated with avelox for suspected PNA 4-5 times since [**Month (only) 547**].
About two weeks ago, she presented with progressive dyspnea and could barely ambulate across the room.
PET CT on [**2178-7-9**] showed R lung collapse, intense uptake at distal trachea and proximal R mainstem bronchus.
Bronchoscopy on [**2178-7-22**] revealed complete malignant right sided airway obstruction with growth of the tumor through the mesh of the stent.
Biopsy was positive for SCC.
She signed out AMA, but then re presented with progressive dyspnea on [**7-27**].
A plan for brachytherapy was considered, but patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] to relieve airway obstruction and for further therapy.
On transfer, she was on a medical floor with no respiratory distress or stridor on 1L NC.
She was found have complete obstruction of the right main bronchus and partial obstruction of the left main bronchus with purulent secretions throughout.
The right mid and lower lobes were localized and were open, right upper lobe is completely gone.

It was noted that she had a pericardial effusion on the CT scan, which cardiology came to evaluate with echo and determined that there were no signs of tamponade.
She was started on antibiotics (Vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]) empirically for transient bacteremia ([**2-3**] to IP procedure) and possible post-obstructive pneumonia.
There were appreciable pus and partial blockage of the left main bronchus from the tumor.
