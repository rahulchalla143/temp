Admission Date:  [**2177-10-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2177-10-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2108-8-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Morphine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 45**] Chief Complaint: admission after pericardial centesis.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: pericardiocentesis and drain placement.
History of Present Illness: Pt is a 69 yof with PMH of locally advanced mediastinal carcinoma (?thymic CA vs NSCLCA) on treatment with Cisplatin/etopside, and XRT.
Pt udernwent CT for evaluation of mass recently which demonstrated mod-large pericardial effusion ant.
mediastinal mass surrounding aorta, pulm artery and hilar LAD.
Echo confirmed presence of pericardial effusion, ?RV deformation.
On admission to CCU pt only complained of mild chest discomfort surrounding the procedure site.
Denied any chest pain or difficulty breathing.
Past Medical History: h/o Mediastinal mass  Social History: 40 pack year history.
Pericardial drain in place wound site without drainage.
No hematoma or gross oozing appreciated.
Anterior mediastinal mass which partially surrounding the aorta and pulmonary artery with enlarged left hilar lymph nodes appears stable.
No chest wall invasion is identified.
Moderate- to large-sized pericardial effusion, which has increased in size when compared to the previous exam.
There is a large, circumferential pericardial effusion with fibrin deposits  on the surface of the heart.
There is sustained right and left atrial invagination, consistent with low filling pressures or early tamponade.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral valve inflow, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape unavailable for review) of [**2173-3-1**], the pericarial effusion and tamponade are new.
Cath [**10-29**] Resting preprocedure hemodynamics revealed equalization of pressures between the RA (RA mean pressure 11mmHG) and the pericardium (12mmHg) consistent with tamponade physiology.
Successful drainage of 400cc serosanguinous fluid from pericardial space.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with  paradoxical septal motion.
Resting regional  wall motion abnormalities include hypokinesis of the anterior septum and anterior walls.
The remaining segments are mildly hypokinetic (?related to tachycardia).
There is a 1.2cm echogenic space seen anterior to the right ventricular free wall in the subcostal view - c/w organized effusion, hematomya, or tumor.
There is no evidence for RV diastolic collapse/tamponade physiology.
Compared with the prior study of [**2177-10-30**], the anterior echogenic space is  more prominent/larger - but the views are not directly comparable and may be related to technical factors.
Brief Hospital Course: A&P:  69 yof with mediastinal mass ?thymic ca vs nscla with malignant pericardial effusion now s/p pericardial drainage transfer to CCU for mgmt.
Pump - Patient with significant cardial effusion with equalization in pressures consistent with temponade now s/p pericardial effusion removal 400cc.
However per post cath echo pt with continued depressed EF.
Repeat echo the following day revealed that pt continued to have mild hypokinesis however not clear if this due to the views vs. pt being tachycardic.
Tachy at times upto 120s.
[] Pericardial Effusion - Drain in place post procedure and monitored on tele.
DDx for pleural effusion is wide however given the cell count with numerous RBC, this is likely hemorrhagic pericardial effusion.
Potential etiologies for hemorrhagic effusions include Malignancy ??????
18%, Postpericardiotomy syndrome ??????
13%, Complications of myocardial infarction (free wall rupture, thrombolysis) ??????
11%, Idiopathic ??????
7%, Aortic dissection ??????
4%, Trauma ??????
- f/u fluid cytology.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: cardiac tamponade pericardial effusion tachycardia mediastinal mass anemia   Discharge Condition: good   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for fluid around you heart.
We do NOT feel you are at risk for heart failure at this time.
