HOSPITAL COUSRE:  This 72 year-old female with anemia, coagulopathy secondary to Coumadin and GI bleed.
All of her stools remained guaiac positive.
Biopsies were obtained of this as well as EGD demonstrated benign appearing masses in the second part of the duodenum and atrophy and scalloping in the second part of the duodenum.
Colonoscopy revealed liquid melanotic stool in the rectum, sigmoid colon and descending colon.
There was a single sessile 10 mm nonbleeding polyp of benign appearance in the distal transverse colon 80 cm.
These were not removed secondary to poor   prep.
The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation.
Given her GI bleed Coumadin therapy was discontinued and her coagulopathy was reversed.
Given the history of this GI bleed, Coumadin will not be restarted until at least after a repeat colonoscopy.
Her Amiodarone was discontinued secondary to her being in fibrillation.
For her diabetes she is to continue on her Glucotrol.
