Admission Date:  [**2130-2-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-2-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2058-2-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11040**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 71 yo F with h/o CAD, A. Fib, COPD, recent diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma presents with one day of worsening shortness of breath.
She reports that within the last week, she developed productive cough and shortness of breath which worsened so that she was feeling short of breath at rest this morning and albuterol nebs, combivent MDI were not providing any relief.
She denies subjective fevers with her worsening respiratory status, but says she transiently had low grade fevers on Wednesday [**2130-2-1**] in the setting of diarrhea which has since resolved.
She denies chest pain/palpitations.
She does report chronic low right lateral rib pain in the setting of her hepatic malignancy.
CXR did not reveal e/o CHF nor infiltrates and CT chest did not show consolidation.
She had a CT head for her headache in the setting of known malignancy which has not yet been read.
CT abdomen showed liver mass causing mass effect on IVC, but no evidence of IVC thrombosis.
It also showed diverticulosis/no diverticulitis.
CTA chest showed second order left lower lobe PE of doubtful clinical significance.
She has been requiring continuous nebs and, thus, was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for continued respiratory care.
ROS:  She has had Left occipital to left frontal headache x 2days.
She had diarrhea upon return from a recent cruise, but C. diff and stool studies were negative.
She has not had diarrhea x several days.
She reports poor UOP x 2 days and decreased PO food and fluid [**3-3**] poor appetite.

muscles currently HEENT: PERRL, dry MM Neck: No JVD appreciated, but difficult given body habitus, supple, no LAD appreciated CV: tachycardic, irreg.
No crackles nor rhonchi.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[**2130-2-5**] EKG:  A. Fib 82 bpm, no acute ST, T wave changes.
There is tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
Lungs are clear without focal infiltrates, pleural effusions, or signs of pulmonary edema.
Somewhat limited comparison of liver masses due to difference in modality but approximate stability of largest mass.
Liver mass causes mass effect on IVC, but no evidence of IVC thrombosis.
Severe atherosclerotic disease involving coronary arteries, great vessels, abdominal aorta, and major tributaries.
Focal aneurysmatic dilatation of the mid abdominal aorta.
Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Severe degenerative changes involving the bony structures.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 yo F with h/o CAD, A. fib, COPD, hepatocellular carcinoma admitted for shortness of breath requiring continuous nebulizer treatments.
# Shortness of breath/COPD exacerbation:  Her shortness of breath was attributed to COPD exacerbation as she remained diffusely bronchospastic on exam.
Although she was recently diagnosed with PE, CTA chest upon admission did not reveal propagation, but rather showed stable second order chronic PE in the left lower lobe and this was thought unlikely to be contributing to her symptoms.
Additionally, there were no infiltrates on CXR nor CT chest.
Recent CT abdomen showed liver mass causing mass effect on IVC, but no evidence of IVC thrombosis.
# CAD: s/p MI and CABG in [**2115**].
Cardiac enzymes originally revealed MB index slightly elevated at 6.5 and troponin also up at 0.05, but with full cycling, troponin decreased to 0.02 and index was no longer significant.
EKG did not reveal any ischemic changes and she denied any symptoms of chest pain.
She was continued on aspirin, BB was restarted when blood pressure could tolerate and statin was held in the setting of her hepatic malignancy.
# CHF:  Although BNP was elevated to 8340, she had no evidence of fluid overload on exam nor on CXR.
# HTN:  She remained hypotensive compared to her baseline and appeared dry on exam.
Resolved with IV hydration and likely represented prerenal etiology given her dry appearance on exam and response to hydration.
# RA:  She was continued on steroids, plaquenil, and methotrexate and oxycodone for breakthrough pain.
# Pulmonary embolism: h/o PE s/p IVC filter placement.
CTA in ED revealed small PE which was thought unlikely clinically significant given not hypoxic.
# Code:  As above, her code status was reevaluated in the setting of her rapidly progressing hepatocellular carcinoma and was changed to CMO.
She was placed on morphine gtt for respiratory comfort.
