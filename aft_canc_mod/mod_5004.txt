Admission Date:  [**2181-11-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2181-11-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2123-12-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 15373**] Chief Complaint: 57 year old man with history of malignant melanoma, left parietal infarct, multiple intracranial lesions most likely consistent with metastasis, and ischemic right foot.
Right femoral popliteal bypass   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 66264**] is a 57 year old man with a history of melanoma status post excision in [**2181-7-14**], lung nodule on CXR 2-3 months ago, as well as history of deep vein thrombosis, peripheral vascular disease and hypothyroidism who transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-4**] for workup of a cold, blue right foot.
Over the past 2 weeks, his family has noted intermittent episodes of confusion and agitation.
He also complained of a mild headache and vomited several times.
His wife called an ambulance and he was brought to a local ED where he was found to have a cold, blue foot.
Peripheral vascular disease 5.
Hypothyroidism 6.
No history of stroke or seizure 7.
?GERD-admitted on Protonix   Social History: No history of tobacco or alcohol.
Family History: Father died of "rare blood disease" at 39.
History of diabetes in his mother.
Physical Exam: Exam: T-99.5 BP-142/77 HR-81-89 RR-[**11-28**] O2Sat-96% Gen: Lying in bed, NAD HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2 Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally Abd: +BS soft, nontender Ext: right foot cold and mottled, no palpable pulse.
Speech is fluent with mildly impaired comrehension (unable to "point to source of illumination" though can follow simpler appendicular commands), repetition is intact; naming impaired for low frequency objects, but was able to name all items on the stroke card.
No dysarthria.
[**Location (un) **] and writing profoundly impaired:  He is able to write illegibly in capital letters, but no discernable words formed.
No finger anomia.
Evidence of apraxia or neglect.
Extraocular movements intact bilaterally, no nystagmus.
No observed myoclonus or tremor.
Gait/Romberg: Unable to assess due to ischemic foot.
EEG:[**2181-11-4**] This is an abnormal EEG of stage II sleep due to the infrequent bursts of generalized delta frequency slowing.
This abnormality suggests a deep midline subcortical dysfunction.
Enhancing 7 mm lesion in the left parietal lobe, concerning for metastatic focus given history of melanoma.
Surrounding edema within the left parietal lobe may be secondary to this metastatic focus.
Given its large distribution relative to metastatic lesion and loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation and sulcal effacement, infarction should also be considered.
Mild shift of midline rightward approximately 2 mm.
No evidence of gross herniation.
Subacute infarction in the left posterior MCA/PCA - MCA watershed zone distribution.
Three more rounded areas of enhancement in the left hemisphere, likely representing metastatic disease.
There is a wedge-shaped area of increased T1 signal which partially enhances following intravenous gadolinium administration involving the left posterior parietal lobe along the watershed distribution.
No other abnormal enhancements are seen within the brain parenchyma.
The examination does not exclude the presence of metastatic disease.
There is a small enhancing lesion involving the left caudate nucleus which was present on the previous exam.
The left posterior parietal lesion is not visualized on the current exam.
Possible prior inferior infarct.
Since previous tracing, no significant change.
Carotid Ultrasound:  No evidence of internal carotid artery stenosis on either side.
Imaging studies demonstrated a subacute infarction in the left posterior MCA/PCA territory along with multiple lesions suggestive of metastatic disease, question melanoma.
Outside pathology confirmed incidence of malignant melanoma ([**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1105**]) on his back from that was removed with negative lymph nodes in [**7-19**].
A Neuro-oncology consult was obtained and workup for potential source of metastatic appearing brain lesions was performed.
On [**11-6**], a CT torso was negative; notably, it did not show evidence of the pulmonary nodules seen previously at [**Hospital3 **].
On [**11-7**], a bone scan was negative for osseious disease.
Cytology from cerebrospinal fluid failed to demonstrate malignant cells in the CSF.
The family were able to meet with Neuro-Oncologist [**Initials (NamePattern5) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern5) 4253**] to discuss options for diagnosis of the brain lesions and therapeutic options.
A WAND study of the brain was conducted on [**2181-11-22**], and due to changes in the parietal lesion, which was more wedge-shaped and consistent with infarct, the decision was made to reimage the brain via MRI with and without contrast and MR spectroscopy with plan to discharge Mr. [**Known lastname 68587**] to rehab and have him follow-up with the [**Known lastname **] and Neurosurgical teams.
In regards to his initial presentation, seizures were considered a possible explanation for his behavioral changes.
EEG was abnormal but without epileptiform activity.
Patient was started on Keppra but developed depressed mood.
Dilantin was ceased on [**2181-11-19**] due to supratherapeutic levels and suspected drug rash owing to associated blanching erythematous maculopapular rash and fever.
ECG showed changes suggestive of old infarct.
Duplex ultrasound of carotids found no significant disease.
Vascular: Patient presented with ischemic right foot.
Right lower extremity angiogram was performed.
This showed occlusion of the distal SFA with reconstitution of an anterior tibial artery at its origin with run off to the foot via this vessel.
There was some stenosis or occlusion of the mid anterior tibial with reconstitution distally and flow into the foot via patent dorsalis pedis artery (Please see results).
The decision was made to take the patient to the operating room for a lower extremity revascularization.
As Mr. [**Known lastname 68587**] continued to experience significant pain, a pain consult was obtained and his pain regiment was improved, although it remained difficult to control due to ischemia.
The wound is healing well.
Mr [**Known lastname 68587**] has some post operative pain likely neuropathic in origin due to vascular damage to nerves.
There was no deterioration throughout.
Infectitious disease: Post operative fevers occurred on [**2181-11-17**] and [**2181-11-19**].
Derm: The patient developed an erythematous morbilliform rash during the last week of his admission.
Left MCA parietal lobe stroke, question underlying mass lesions 2.
Peripheral vascular disease status post ischemic right leg status post femoral popliteal bypass 3.
Still with residual parietal lobe infarction signs with difficulty attending to the right side of the world, dyscalculia, difficulty [**Location (un) 1131**] and writing, right left confusion, and finger agnosia.
Please return to the closest Emergency Room if you have any headaches, visual changes, speech or language disturbances, focal numbness, weakness, incoordination.
Please call for an appointment; needs to be seen in 1 week to have staples removed.
