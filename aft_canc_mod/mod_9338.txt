Chief Complaint: Headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2145-2-9**] Bilateral Bur hole evacuation of Subdural Hematoma   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 70M w/ history of Burkitt's lymphoma with progressive disease, currently receiving IVAC chemo C2D12 who presents from [**Hospital 14342**] clinic with headache, found to have spontaneous SDH.
Patient received CT head and was found to have bilateral subdural hemorrhage with midline shift.
He denies blurry vision, numbness (other than chronic chin numbness), tingling, weakness of the extremities (outside of chronic weakness which has been attributed to vincristine toxicity, and compression neuropathy due to weight loss).
Patient denies any history of trauma - falls or bumping head.
Labs significant for pancytopenia (WBC 0.1, ANC 80, hct 21.4, plts 7), electrolytes and coags WNL (INR 0.9).
EKG showed sinus @ 90, no acute changes.
Neurosurgery was consulted, and recommended no acute intervention at this time, but stated they will follow patient during admission and give further recs.
It was felt that  some component of his headache may have been related to post-LP given positional nature (patient had LP 1 week prior to admission), however given his clinical deterioration, it became apparent that this was unlikely.
Chronic lower lip numbness and b/l ankle weakness (chronic) were his only apparent neurological  deficits noted.
He had persistent headaches and nausea, patient received multiple head CTs, which were stable until [**2-9**] when midline shift increased, and patient became more lethargic.
He also had persistent emesis.
Post-op CT showed pneumocephalus as expected.
He had  some dizziness and nausea when elevated with PT.
The patient was felt by the Neurosurgery service to be well enough for discharge on [**2-12**]; however, BMT requested that he be transferred back to their service for further managment of headaches and nausea.
On arrival to the floor, he stats he has a frontal headache which is [**4-27**] inintensity but similar to that he had before.
He also complained of some nausea which resolved with medication.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.

There was also new focal FDG uptake in the L4 vertebral body and left humeral head are also consistent with a neoplastic process.

The degree of pneumocephalus is clearly improved.
No new foci of hyperdensity to suggest interval hemorrhage are seen.
Minimal midline shift, less than 2 mm to the left, is unchanged.
There is edema and sulcal effacement with mass effect on the ventricles as compared to the CT of [**2144-8-2**], which was obtained prior to the hemorrhage.
An ovoid hypodensity in the region of the right cerebellar hemisphere appears unchanged and may be related to extra-axial fluid.
No concerning osseous lesion is seen.
No new foci of hemorrhage identified.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: As above, there is a somewhat ill-defined 2.6 (AP) x 2.1 cm (TRV) fluid-attenuation collection in the right superior aspect of the posterior fossa, with slight mass effect on the subjacent cerebellar hemisphere (2:[**11-29**]).
While of slightly more fluid-attenuation over the series of studies since [**2145-2-2**], it is not clearly present on MR studies of [**9-26**] and [**2144-12-11**], and may represent a relatively acute posterior fossa subdural hygroma.
