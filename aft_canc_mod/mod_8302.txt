Admission Date:  [**2121-4-20**]       Discharge Date:  [**2103-4-23**]  Date of Birth:   [**2030-1-29**]       Sex:  M  Service:  FENARD ICU  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old male with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed in [**2103-2-16**] and recent radiation therapy to spine.
History of coronary artery disease status post CABG and MI in [**2100**].
The patient presents with hypotension and nausea, requiring dopamine pressors.
The patient has a recent admission to [**Hospital1 190**] from [**4-9**] to [**4-18**] for right upper lobe pneumonia and left arm cellulitis.
He was treated with oxacillin, which was changed to dicloxacillin for cellulitis and Levaquin for right upper lobe pneumonia.
The patient was also found to be adrenally insufficient and had some episodes with hypotension and orthostasis during that admission.
He was taken to [**Location (un) **] Emergency Room, where he was found to be afebrile with pulse of 60 and blood pressure 104/51.
There was little response to these therapies and the patient was started on Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin for presumptive sepsis.
The EKG at the outside hospital showed on significant change and no evidence of ischemia.
When the patient arrived to [**Hospital1 188**] MICU he was mentating but lethargic with systolic blood pressures from 110 to 130s on dopamine drip at 15 mcg per kilogram per minute.
The patient was unable to remember the recent events since that morning.
The patient denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, nauseas, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, vision changes, abdominal pain, numbness, weakness, tingling, fevers, chills, bright red blood per rectum, or melena.
Coronary artery disease status post CABG in [**2100**], status post MI in [**2100**], EF 50% [**2103-3-19**].
Status post T11 fracture and vertebroplasty.
Left arm cellulitis treated two weeks ago.
Recent pneumonia in the right upper lobe.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco or alcohol.
GENERAL:  The patient was alert and oriented times three, lethargic at times, but arousable.
NECK:  No lymphadenopathy or jugulovenous distention.
LUNGS: Lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
BACK:  Healing spinal scar, no erythema or fluctuance.
ABDOMEN:  Old right upper quadrant scar, soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.
No perirectal abscesses.
No other evidence of edema except for the right upper extremity.
EKG from outside hospital showed normal sinus rhythm with normal axis, normal intervals with nonspecific T-wave abnormalities.
Chest x-ray on admission showed the following:  Right lower lobe opacification and probably small effusion.
IMPRESSION:  This is a 73-year-old male with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and history of CABG/MI presenting with hypotension requiring pressors.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient has a history of coronary artery disease status post CABG and MI now with hypotension and question of reported chest pressure, nausea, and diaphoresis.
EKG did not show any evidence of ischemia.
He remained chest pain free during the hospital stay.
Therefore, cardiac cause of hypotension was unlikely.
The patient did appear to be intravascularly depleted with dry mucous membranes and history of orthostasis.
PULMONARY:  The patient has recent admission with right upper lobe pneumonia treated with a seven-day course of Levaquin.
On chest x-ray from this admission the patient had right upper lobe and right lower lobe infiltrates.
He denied any complaints of cough, shortness of breath or chest pain.
He remained afebrile during the entire hospital stay.
Treatment was changed to just empiric coverage for community-acquired pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonia with the third generation cephalosporin as above.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  As above in pulmonary section.
The patient has a bandemia, but low white blood cell possibly secondary to immunocompromise.
As stated above, the patient remained afebrile during the hospital stay and once his intravascular status was repleted, he maintained good blood pressures, therefore, making sepsis as an etiology much less likely.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient has history of constipation and question of malabsorption syndrome.
The patient has history of psychiatric obsession with bowels per report.
HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY:  The patient has history of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma recently diagnosed now status post XRT times two treatments to T11.
His pain was well controlled with Methadone and Lidocaine patch and Neurontin.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient has known adrenal insufficiency from the last hospital stay, which displayed a positive cortisol stimulation test and low minimal and corticoid levels.
The patient's peripheral IVs in the right arm were removed secondary to tenderness and ecchymosis.
He arrived upon transfer with Dopamine flowing into his right arm peripheral IV, therefore, most likely the symptoms were secondary to either thrombophlebitis versus mild skin necrosis.
The patient's ecchymotic areas began to improve prior to discharge as did the isolated right upper extremity edema.
Hypotension likely secondary to dehydration.
Right lower lobe pneumonia and adrenal insufficiency.
