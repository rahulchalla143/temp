Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Existing 10 French modified pigtail drain patent in its intrahepatic component, but obstructed distally with no contrast drainage noted into the hepaticojejunostomy.
Several separate areas of stricturing identified within the intrahepatic ducts in segments not directly accessed by the existing tube.
Multiple large liver and smaller uterine abscesses, likely secondary to hematogenous spread of pathogen.
Possible bilateral lower lobe pneumonia, concerning for aspiration etiology.
Biliary drainage catheter in unchanged position, surrounded by a locally recurrent mass at the Whipple resection bed.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan:  This is a 52yo female with PMH of pancreatic cancer s/p whipple and with metastases to the liver who presents from home with fever, malaise, and leakage of fluid from around her biliary drain site.
This is concerning for cholangitis with report of BC positive for GNR at outside lab facility.
# Biliary Drainage: Patient presented from home with blockage of external drainage from biliary drain and leakage of fluid from around the tube.
Her bilirubin was elevated on presentation likely from acute biliary drainage blockage and improved after the exchange.
However, following the tube exchange, she was noted to have decreased drainage.
CT abdomen was performed which revealed her biliary tube to be in good positions, however there are also multiple hepatic and uterine abscesses which may be due to hematogenous spread of pathogen or possibly superinfection of necrotic metasteses.
# GNR/GPC/GNC bacteremia: Patient reportedly has positive BC from outside lab for GNR.
Her bacteremia is likely biliary in origin, with hematogenous spread to her liver, resulting in these abscesses.
The etiology of her bacteremia being these multiple hepatic abscesses was discussed with the patient and her family, and a decision was reached to forgoe IR intervention, and to continue just with IV antibiotics and her home hospice care.
# Pancreatic Carcinoma: Patient has pancreatic adenocarcinoma with metastases to the liver.
Her CT scan after biliary stent replacement showed likely superinfection of necrotic metasteses in her liver, which is a very poor prognostic sign.
She will continue with her prior pain and nausea regimen consisting of hydromorphone and morphine prn, as well as ondansetron, compazine and lorazepam.
She will continue creon for pancreatic enzyme repletion.
She had no further episodes of hypoxia.
She did not require supplemental oxygen at the time of discharge and does not experience any shortness of breath of dyspnea.
