Admission Date:  [**2169-7-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-8-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2111-1-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 598**] Chief Complaint: Polytrauma  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2169-7-11**] EXTERNAL FIXATION PELVIC FRACTURE [**Doctor Last Name 7376**] [**2169-7-13**] ORIF OF ANTERIOR RING; ORIF POSTERIOR RING; EXAM UNDER ANESTHESIA LEFT SHOULDER AND ELBOW;I AND D LEFT ARM AND WOUND CLOSURE [**Doctor Last Name 1005**] [**2169-7-21**] REVISION OF SACRAL SCREW WITH CANNULATED SCREW   History of Present Illness: 58 y.o.
CT scans were performed that showed left depressed skull fracture with associated SDH, left temporal bone fracture, ?
basilar fracture with extension into carotid, open book pelvic fracture with pelvic hematoma, extraperitoneal bladder rupture, left [**12-19**] posterior rib fractures, posterior [**4-21**] fractures on left.
Dried blood in the nares bilaterally.
Active bleeding from the L auditory canal.
Significant contusion along L lateral chest wall Cardiac: RRR.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements intact on R with only upward\gaze impaired on L No nystagmus.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Thin acute left subdural hematoma and possible small focus of left frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage, as above.
Extensive left sided skull and skull base fractures, including left temporal bone fracture with extension through the petrous apex adjacent to the expected course of the internal carotid artery.
Extensive pelvic fractures including a wide diastasis of the symphysis pubis and a longitudinal fracture traversing the sacrum, coccyx and L5 vertebral bodies.
The sacral fracture abuts the central canal raising concern for possible nerve root/cord injury.
Recommend delayed views through the bladder to further assess with more contrast excreted, may demonstrate evidence of a bladder rupture, although if none seen, can not be excluded.
Extensive hematoma involving the perineum and base of the urethra as well as a foci of pelvic hyperdensity, raising concern for vascular injury.
Numerous left rib fractures as detailed above.
[**2169-7-10**] Left elbow : Note is made of fragmentation at the olecranon process, which may be chronic or alternatively reflect acute injury.
Otherwise, there is no evidence of additional fracture or dislocation.
There are no radiopaque foreign bodies or soft tissue calcifications.
Mild narrowing of the petrous segment of the left internal carotid artery compared to the right, may relate to vasospasm/some material within the carotid canal.
There is decreased enhancement of the left cavernous sinus, in addition.
Further evaluation with head and neck MR, with axial fat sat sequences to exclude intramural hematoma/dissection can be considered for better assessment.
Diffuse narrowed caliber of the left vertebral artery, likely due to hypoplasia.
However, evaluation at the level of C2 and C3 is limited due to prominent adjacent venous plexus.
Fluid in the paranasal sinuses and the mastoid air cells on the left side as described above.
Extraperitoneal bladder rupture.
Increased dense material in the right medial thigh as well as anterior subcutaneous tissues and rectus abdominal musculature, new from the previous study and reflecting interval bleeding since the preceding scan.
Extraperitoneal rupture of the urinary bladder, with contrast  extravasating into the extraperitoneal pelvic cavity and extending to the right inguinal canal layering into the scrotum and along soft tissue of the anterior lower abdominal wall and right thigh.
Fat stranding and hyperdense material along the right thigh and anterior subcutaneous tissues could be a combination of hematoma, urine and contrast.
Interval increase in size of the scrotum, with hyperdense fluid filling the scrotal sac, with increase amount compared to prior, likely mixed urine and contrast; however, cannot exclude hematoscrotum.
Severe pelvic fracture including wide diastasis of symphysis pubis and longitudinal fracture traversing L5 vertebral body and entire sacrum with distraction of fracture fragments at the sacrum of 1.3cm.
Anterior epidural hematoma, from L4-5 intervertebral disc level to S2, with displacement and deformity of the thecal sac along with crowding of the roots of the cauda equina and moderate-canal stenosis as described above.
Degenerative changes at L4-5 level resulting in bilateral moderate neural foraminal narrowing and mild impingement on the L5 nerves on both sides.
No source for elevated bilirubin identified with no intra- or  extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
Distended gallbladder without secondary signs of cholecystitis.
Moderate right pleural effusion with associated right lung atelectasis.
[**2169-7-29**] EEG : This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the presence of sharply contoured theta slowing seen best over the left temporal region suggestive of an underlying structual lesion.
Furthermore, the presence of frequent bursts of generalized delta slowing visualized throughout the record is suggestive of a deep midline structural abnormality.
There was no epileptiform activity seen.
Markedly reduced but persistent leak of contrast outside the bladder secondary to traumatic bladder rupture.
Interval resolution of pelvic fluid collection.
No frank fracture detected.
Surrounding irregular density may represent post-traumatic calcification, suggesting a subacute injury.
2) There is evidence of several fractures involving the left- sided ribs.

2) There is evidence of several fractures involving the left- sided ribs         Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 2470**] was admitted to the T/SICU.
He went to the OR emergently for an external fixation of his pelvic fracture with orthopedics.
On POD 3 he went back to the OR for a definitive ORIF of the anterior and posterior pelvis, reduction of left shoulder under fluoroscopy and washout of the L elbow wound.
He was started on cefepime/vanco at Urology's request for the extraperitoneal bladder rupture.
On POD [**3-16**] a repeat CTH was performed demonstrating a stable SDH but a new small L temporal lobe hematoma adjacent to evolving contusion.
On POD [**4-16**] his chest xray showed worsening infiltrates so a bronch was done showing LUL & LLL mucus plugging and purulent fluid.
On [**7-17**] his urine output decreased so a renal ultrasound was performed and negative for hydronephrosis.
He was also started on zosyn for GNR in sputum (Pseudomonas).
On [**7-19**] the patients oxygen saturations dropped with a chest xray showing fluid overload so he was diuresed with lasix.
Neuro: He was followed by Neursosurgery for his left parieto-occipitial skull fracture with small subjacent SDH which was manged nonoperatively, Serial head CT scans and his exam were followed closely.
An EEG was also done to assess for seizure activity, no epileptiform activity was seen.
He has no chest pain or shortness of breath and has remained free of any arrhythmias.
Resp:  His pseudomonas pneumonia resolved with double coverage with Tobra and Zosyn and he is currently off oxygen with RA saturations of 97%.
He has no sputum production and has been afebrile.
From a GI standpoint he is taking a regular diet and tolerating it well after passing a speech and swallow evaluation.
He has a seperated left shoulder which will require follow up as an outpatinet in [**Hospital 1957**] clinic; discussion re: surgery will take place at that time.
Milk of Magnesia 800 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML's PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
