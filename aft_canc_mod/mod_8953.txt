On arrival he was noted to have sBP in 60's and was started on levophed and bolused with IVF.
ECG showed peaked t waves and K was 6.8.

Understands simple english SKIN: cool, dry HEENT: mmm w/ dried blood at gumline, scleral icterus, arcus senilus NECK: prominent venous pulsations, no LAD; no carotid bruits; neck supple LUNGS: bilateral rales by anterior exam; no wheezes or rhonchi HEART: tachycardic, could not appreciate murmur ABDOMEN: faint bowel sounds, soft, tender at RUQ, distended, liver palpable (about 1cm under costal margin) EXTREMITIES: edema 1+R, 2+L (chronic); marked asterixis NEURO: alert, intermittently answering questions.
Studies: CXR ([**2181-6-16**]) 6:49 p.m.: There are multiple new ill-defined patchy opacities throughout both lungs, perihilar haze, and an effaced right diaphragmatic border.
This is secondary to multifocal pneumonia, asymmetric pulmonary edema, or combination.
A small right pleural effusion is also present.
IMPRESSION:  Multifocal pneumonia, asymmetric pulmonary edema, or combination.
CXR (5/13/06)7:57 p.m.: In the one hour interval, a right internal jugular central venous catheter has been placed with the tip projecting over the cavoatrial junction.
There is no evidence for pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Worsening bilateral opacification with new central venous line provjecting over cavoatrial junction.
Portal vein thrombosis with apparent cavernous transformation.
Heterogeneous right liver lobe lesions consistent with HCC.
Gallbladder wall thickening with no evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 54 yo M with h/o HCV, hepatocellular ca, cirrhosis, ascites who presents with sepsis, hyperkalemia and ARF.
# septic shock: The patient was admitted with concern for septic shock of a cholagitis or lung origin.
# hypotension: Pt's BP at presentation was 70s/palp.
# MS changes: The pt was unresponsive off sedation, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy but intracranial process is another possibility.
# GI bleed: Pt reported to have coffee-ground material from NG aspirate.
Pt has known cirrhosis and portal vein thrombosis which has likely resulted in the development of porto-caval anastomosis and varices.
Of note, pt had EGD in [**4-9**] which did not show any evidence of varices.
# ?ST depression: there was no CE elevation .
# coagulopathy: INR elevated to 2.1 - likely due to liver failure.
Pt got vitamin K but coagulopathy worsened.
# HCC: Pt has a large liver mass and elevated alpha-fetoprotein.
Patient is not a candidate for surgery or transplant due to the size of his mass, and the presence of cirrhosis and portal venous involvement.
This was the underlying cause of his worsening status over this hospital stay.
On the final day of hospitalization he developed bleeding from the ETT, line site, and HCT dropped.
The ETT was withdrawn and the patient developed cardiopulmonary failure within 15 minutes.
