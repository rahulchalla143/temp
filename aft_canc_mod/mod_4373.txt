Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
[**5-22**] CXR: Left lower lung linear atelectasis versus scarring.
[**5-23**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %) with anterior, septal and apical akinesis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**5-27**] CXR: In comparison with the prior studies, there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary edema.
Some mild atelectatic changes are seen at the bases.
However, no evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
No acute intracranial abnormality; specifically, there is no evidence of hemorrhage or edema.
Clear included paranasal sinuses, middle ear cavities and mastoid air cells.
Well-defined lesion in the right frontovertex scalp soft tissues; this should be correlated directly with physical examination.
[**5-29**] EGD: - Erythema and congestion in the gastroesophageal junction compatible with esophagitis - Mild erythema, mild atrophy in the stomach body compatible with gastritis (biopsy) - Small hiatal hernia - Mild congestion and erythema in the antrum compatible with gastritis (biopsy) - Ulcer in the incisura (endoclip) - The antrum was deformed, suggesting previous PUD.
The tissue around pyloric channel was edematous - Granularity, erythema and congestion in the duodenal bulb and first part of the duodenum compatible with duodenitis (biopsy) - The duodenal bulb was deformed, suggesting previous PUD.
- Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: - follow-up biopsy results - Pt needs repeat EGD to have biopsy from the ulcer to r/o gastric CA while she is more stable.
Fundic mucosa with chronic inactive gastritis.
No intestinal metaplasia seen.
Antral mucosa with chronic focally active gastritis.
No intestinal metaplasia seen.
C.  Duodenum: Duodenal mucosa, no diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The patient has moderate mitral regurgitation.
Based on [**2101**] ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in 1 year.
DISCHARGE LABS [**2105-6-3**]: WBC 10.3 HCT 25.7 (stable) Plt 504 Na 143 K 4.1 Cl 110 HCO3 23 BUN 20 Cr 1.5 Glc 78  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 77625**] is a 73yo F with h/o CRI admitted with tachycardia, anemia and hypocalcemia.
# Anemia: The patient had guaiac postive light brown stool on arrival to the ICU, no known baseline HCT.
She underwent upper and lower endoscopy, which revealed an ulcer in the incisura - the ulcer began bleeding after the first endoclip was placed, so 2 more endoclips were placed afterward with resolution of the bleeding.
Biopsy taken in the stomach showed chronic inactive gastritis, no intestinal metaplasia, and negative [**Doctor Last Name 6311**] stain.
GI recommended a repeat biopsy of the stomach ulcer when the patient is more stable.
She had intermittent runs of SVT during the first few days of hospitalization.
She remained asymptomatic during the tachycardia and was hemodynamically stable.
It was most likely due to cardiac irritability in the setting of severe anemia and transient cardiomyopathy (see below).
- f/u will be scheduled with Atrius cardiology  # Hypocalcemia: Unclear etiology, though given social stressors and concern for possible depression may not have been having reliable po intake.
Additionally, she may have been using magnesium citrate excessively as a laxative that could be contributing to her electrolyte abnormalities (documented in visit from PCP's office).
PTH was noted to be markedly elevated to 510.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt noted to have baseline creatine ~1.5.
Creatinine was elevated to 2.0 during the hospitalization, likely due to profound anemia.
Pt was also noted to have a urinary tract infection, which was treated for a 7d course of Clindamycin.
# Respiratory Distress: The patient developed respiratory distress in the MICU, requiring intubation.
The WBC continued to climb for a few days after starting treatment - however CXR was unremarkable, BCx were negative, and the patient had no other localizing signs or symptoms.
She remained mildly confused for several days after, with good improvement day to day.
Only e/o infection was the UTI, as above.
# PUMP: Initial TTE, in the setting of tachycardia, showed moderately depressed LV systolic function, EF 30%.
The patient was fluid overloaded in the MICU, requiring intubation and diuresis.
Moderate MR was noted, and repeat ECHO in 1 year was recommended.
- repeat ECHO in 1 year - stress test as outpatient - has Atrius cards follow up scheduled  # Positive PAP: Family notified us of positive malignant cells on recent PAP smear.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Anemia GI bleed Supraventricular tachycardia Urinary tract infection Acute on chronic renal failure Hypocalcemia Altered mental status Pulmonary edema   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital with a low blood count and a fast heart rate.
Your rate heart is now being controlled with new medications.
Your low blood count was due to a bleeding ulcer in your stomach - this was clipped by the gastroenterologists, and there has been no further bleeding.
You were also found to have a urinary tract infection, and you finished a course of antibiotics to treat this.
Your heart function was depressed, likely because of the low blood count and the fast heart rate.
