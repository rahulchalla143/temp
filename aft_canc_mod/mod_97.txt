Admission Date:  [**2180-9-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2180-10-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2109-8-6**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CARDIAC CARE UNIT  ADDENDUM:  RADIOGRAPHIC EXAMINATION:  Chest x-ray on [**2180-10-17**]: No pneumothorax.
Moderate left ventricular enlargement.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound:  The liver has a homogeneous echotexture and contains two small echogenic lesions, both of which are in the right lobe.
These are compatible with small hemangioma.
No other focal liver lesions.
The gallbladder was mildly distended.
No gallbladder wall edema, no evidence of cholelithiasis.
Impression:  Normal appearing gallbladder given the patient's fasting state without evidence of cholelithiasis, small hemangioma ....................  CT of the abdomen and pelvis:  Impression:  1.
No fluid collection or abscess identified.
Mild thickening of the wall of the ascending colon, similar to prior examination.
This pattern is persistent since the last CT examination and raises the possibility of colitis, infectious, ischemic, or inflammatory.
Left pneumothorax with epicardial pacer wires traversing the left pleura.
Bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis in the lung bases.
7 mm nodule in the right major fissure.
While this appears to have increased since the prior study, there may be associated volume averaging from the fluid in the fissure.
Possible thickening of the cecum which is most likely due to circumferential fluid.
There is no surrounding fat stranding.
Left atrium is mildly dilated.
Aortic valve leaflets were mildly thickened.
Mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened.
No pacing wires were visualized.
Left atrium mildly dilated.
The right atrium is mildly dilated.
In some views, very small 2 mm, highly mobile echodensity seen in close proximity attached to the atrial lead consistent with possible thrombus vegetation artifact.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with akinesis of the inferior inferolateral walls.
No left ventricular thrombus is seen.
There is moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened but not stenotic.
Mitral leaflets were mildly thickened.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was transferred over to [**Hospital6 256**] with evidence of cellulitis surrounding the pacemaker site.
Blood cultures and cultures from site resulted in MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus).
During treatment with Oxacillin, the patient developed Clostridium difficile infection.
The patient's blood cultures grew back fungemia with evidence of yeast in the blood.
The patient was successfully treated with fluconazole for elimination of the yeast infection; however, the patient developed transaminitis with ALT peaking at 419 and AST peaking at 746.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient on admission had late extraction of right atrium and right ventricle and CS leads in the Operating Room.
The patient had placement of left ventricular leads (epicardial) and left atrial lead.
Pacemaker replacement was deferred until infection was successfully treated.
The patient was treated for congestive heart failure with a successful regimen of milrinone, Natrecor, and Bumex.
On [**2180-10-17**], the patient had a pacemaker revision without any complications.
The patient was maintained on heparin throughout the hospital course due to history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and was started on Coumadin on the day prior to discharge.
The heparin was off for procedures and restarted right after.
PULMONARY:  The patient was noted to have bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis on the chest x-ray and appreciated on the examination.
With aggressive diuresis for volume status and continued respiratory support, the patient's lung examination improved with improvement and resolution of effusions.
RENAL:  The patient has baseline chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine of 1.5 to 1.9.
There was a notable increase in creatinine and renal function with replacement of the patient's pacemaker.
OPHTHALMOLOGY:  The patient had an eye examination due to treatment of yeast infection with fluconazole.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  The patient had two episodes of gout each lasting about three days with tenderness, warmth and erythema over the left ankle on the first episode and left metatarsal joints on the second episode.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient had elevated LFTs secondary to treatment with fluconazole.
Inferior myocardial infarction.
Congestive heart failure, systolic and diastolic, acute on chronic.
Atrial fibrillation.
Acute renal failure.
Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus infection.
Atrial flutter.
