However, she continued to have symptoms and was sent to [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital where a head CT demonstrated cerebellar infarcts.
Patient denies fall, chest pain, shortness of breath.
Patient underwent echocardiogram today which showed large left atrial myxoma.
Cardiac surgery is consulted for resection due to high risk of further neurological complications.

There is a focal area of opacity at the right lung base near the site of the removed chest tube -- ?
atelectasis and/or changes related to the chest tube.
No obvious pneumothorax or gross effusion.
Focal opacity at right base near previous site of chest tube and slight improvement in retrocardiac patchy density.
Although there is a curvilinear density at the right lung apex, no lucency to confirm the presence of pneumothorax is identified.
AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta with no atherosclerotic plaque.
Conclusions Pre-CPB: This is a directed study to confirm a left atrial myxoma.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Radiology Report MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2145-9-7**] 7:36 PM MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:55 year old woman s/p L atrial myxoma resection Preliminary Report !!
Multifocal area of acute to subacute infarction as described above involving supra- and infratentorial structures suggestive of embolic etiology.
Areas of susceptibility artifact which appear to lie within the sulci of the bifrontal, right occipital, and left parietal regions.
There is no signal abnormality on other sequences, and no subarachnoid blood products were seen on the recent prior CT, however subarachnoid hemorrhage cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Name13 (STitle) 3952**] was admitted to the Neurology service for unsteady gait, urinary incontinance, slurred speach and paresis of distal upper extremities.
A head CT at an outside hospital revealed cerebellar infarcts.
A TEE was performed which revealed a large left atrial mass which was likely a myxoma.
No PFO or [**Name13 (STitle) **].
She was referred to cardiac surgery for resection of atrial myxoma.
She remained in the ICU for further recovery from surgery and hemodynamic monitoring.
