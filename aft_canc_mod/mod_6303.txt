Admission Date:  [**2164-5-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-6-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2083-5-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Prednisone / Tetanus / Paxil / Prochlorperazine Maleate  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3619**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 80 yo F with a new diagnosis small cell lung cancer on chemotherapy less than 24 hours, transferred to the ICU with progressive hypoxia.
She denies chest pain or shortness of breath.
She does note a non-productive cough for several hours.
She received 10mg IV furosemide given that she likely had a positive fluid balance not well recorded since admission.
Due to persistent hypoxia she is transferred to the ICU.
The patient was originally transferred from [**Hospital6 17390**] ICU with a new diagnosis small cell lung cancer.
She underwent an outpatient work-up including normal nuclear stress test and CT abd/pelvis with mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
On [**2164-3-8**] she was admitted to a hospital in [**Location (un) 78617**], FL for laparoscopic biopsy of a mesenteric node, cecal mass and omentum.
She returned to her PCP with complaints of persistent weight loss and weakness.
She was found on staging to have liver mets and peribronchial lymphadenopathy.
CTA at [**Hospital6 **] revealed right lower lobe bronchus compression with right lower lobe collapse, diffuse lymphadenopathy, small bilateral pleural effusions and by verbal report to have invasion of the SVC with associated SVC thrombus.
ROS: Patient denies any complaints and cannot clearly recall the symptoms that brought her in to the hospital.
She denies fevers, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria, diarrhea, rashes, arthralgias or any other concerning symptoms.
Past Medical History: - Metastatic small cell lung cancer - Hypertension.
- Hyperlipidemia.
- Hypothyroidism.
- History of CVA with left facial numbness.
Lives in [**State 108**]  Family History: Cancer in two uncles on the maternal side and vaginal cancer in maternal grandmother.
[**Name (NI) **] died of lung cancer at age 40, and was a nonsmoker.
Some paradoxical breathing with exaggerated stomach expansion with inspiration.
Ext: Trace bilateral lower extremity edema.
CXR ([**2164-5-5**]): Bilateral pleural effusions with RLL collapse.
External compression of pulmonary artery branches on the right due to extensive mediastinal adenopathy.
Widespread lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum, right hilum, right supraclavicular region and upper abdomen, in keeping with the history of small cell lung cancer.
Left adrenal and likely widespread hepatic metastases.
Superior vena cava is mildly compressed by the right paratracheal lymph nodes but appears patent.
Moderate right and small left dependent pleural effusions.
In the absence of intervention in this region, a primary breast cancer should be considered for the dominant lesion, although differential diagnosis includes inflammatory and infectious etiologies as well as a metastatic focus.
Her respiratory compromise was felt most likely due to airway and vasculature compression/obstruction from tumor burden as seen on recent CTA at the OSH.
The patient also probably had a component of volume overload as seen on CXR and consistent with a recent history of volume rescucitation.
Of note she likely has a contribution of compression from pleural effusions though this was felt not likely to be the primary force causing hypoxia.
The patient was started on chemotherapy with the goal of reducing tumor burden.
Radiation oncology was consulted for consideration of palliative XRT.
If her respiratory status improves and she is able to lie flat, then she could be an XRT candidate in the future.
She was reimaged on [**2164-5-18**] and in comparison to previous CT scan showed 40-50% reduction in tumor burden post-chemotherapy.
A decision was made to initiate a second cycle of chemotherapy with 3 days of etoposide and cisplatinin which she tolerated without difficulty.
A repeat CT scan on day #14 after this chemotherapy showed regression of previously extensive hilar adenopathy.
# Hyponatremia: She also was found to have hyponatremia to 125 without mental status changes.
Urine lytes revealed SIADH, likely [**12-24**] paraneoplastic effect of small cell lung ca.
Hyponatremia eventually resolved and was normal at time of discharge.
# Neutropenia:  patient became neutropenic likely secondary to chemotherapy dosing on admission.
Her white count was monitored closely after second cycle of chemotherapy and became neutropenic with lowest measured ANC of 144 at time of discharge.
She remained afebrile however.
# UTI: A screening urinalysis with culture showed enterococcus in the urine on [**5-26**] and vancomycin was given empirically.
Patient was switched to oral therapy with macrobid and will continue on this for a total of four doses to complete a 10-day course of antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection.
# Diarrhea: Developed diarrhea several days after cycle 2 of chemotherapy with multiple watery bowel movements daily (up to 10 bm's per day).
Infection with Clostridium difficile was suspected, and antibiotics were started.

Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: The [**Location (un) 33316**] Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Small Cell Lung Cancer  Secondary: Hypertension Depression Hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable and afebrile.
Please return to the emergency room if you experience difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, chest pain, or any other symptoms that are concerning to you.
