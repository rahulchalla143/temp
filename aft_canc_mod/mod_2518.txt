Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 52 year old male w/ metastatic prostate cancer s/p neo-adjuvant Rx and RRP admitted for recurrent hematuria s/p Cystoscopy, fulguration of bladder, clot evacuation.
Two days at his rehab facility pt noticed clots in his urine again.
Day of admission pt stated he noticed a lot of blood clots in his urine and decreased urine flow.
He was admitted to Urology and underwent cystoscopic evaluation yesterday for his hematuria, notable for radiation cystitis, with bladder neck bleeding s/p vessel fulguration.
He has continued to have gross hematuria causing a drop in his Hct 30.2->26.9->20.9.
Pt has also had scleral icterus and jaundice for the past few weeks.
Past Medical History: Oncologic history: diagnosed with prostate cancer in [**2163**].
He was recently treated with samarium on [**2170-5-23**], for diffuse bony pain and he was hospitalized in the interim for pain control and altered mental status, thought to be secondary to narcotics.
He also has extensive history of DVT for which he is on Lovenox and PE.
# metastatic prostate cancer to bone refractory to hormone therapy # B LE DVTs c/b B PE s/p IVC filter [**4-/2168**] - s/p IVC venogram and mechanical thrombolysis with local TPA on [**2170-5-7**] for worsening clot burden - lovenox dose increased from 80 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 120 mg [**Hospital1 **] with therapeutic factor Xa on that dose # Psoriasis # Hypercholesterolemia # h/o fundus angioectasia s/p thermal therapy # duodenal bezoar # depression # Seasonal allergies # Obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP  Social History: He lives at home with his wife and his 12 year-old son.
Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally, no wheezes, ronchi or rales Cardiac: RR, nl S1 S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated Abdomen: Soft, NT, ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted Extremities: No edema, 2+ radial, DP pulses b/l Lymphatics: No cervical, supraclavicular, axillary or inguinal lymphadenopathy noted.
Skin: Pupuric lesions noted diffusely on pt's abdomen (present since last admission per pt and pt's wife).
Able to relate history without difficulty.
No abnormal movements noted.
No nystagmus, dysarthria, intention or action tremor.
2+ biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellar reflexes and 2+ ankle jerks bilaterally.

Able to relate history without difficulty.
No abnormal movements noted.
No nystagmus, dysarthria, intention or action tremor.
2+ biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellar reflexes and 2+ ankle jerks bilaterally.
Innumerable hypoechoic hepatic lesions, consistent with diffuse hepatic metastatic disease.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Images of the kidneys demonstrate no hydronephrosis.
[**2170-10-15**] RUQ U/s: No evidence of cholecystitis.
No acute retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Unchanged metastatic disease.
[**2170-10-18**] CXR: Increasing vascular congestion.
[**2170-10-30**]:  Lung volumes are appreciably lower today than previously, which may account for some of the increase in opacification of both lungs, particular the right, but there is clearly new perihilar consolidation in the left lung and probably interstitial abnormality on the right.
Differential diagnosis is either a very asymmetric pulmonary edema or large left upper lobe pneumonia and mild edema elsewhere.
Heart size is partially obscured by elevated diaphragm, but does not appear grossly enlarged.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 52 year old man with metastatic prostate cancer, who had been recently admitted with hematuria; also with history of DVT and PE now off Lovenox since recent admission, presented again with hematuria and bladder discomfort.
## Hematuria: Pt's has gross hematuria from radiation cystitis.
Still with mild hematuria ([**Location (un) 2452**] to pink) with occasional passing of clots, but not hemodynamically significant.
Pt was continued on CBI and he continued to have hematuria requiring multiple blood and platelet transfusions.
Likely secondary to underlying malignancy and bony involvement.
Anemia likely secondary to blood loss anemia (hematuria and blood in stool) and AOCD given iron study results.
Indirect bilirubin not elevated and haptoglobin not elevated, so patient is unlikely to be hemolyzing.
In the ICU the patient continued to have a drop in his hct secondary to blood loss.
## Transaminitis: Likely secondary to hepatic involvement of prostate cancer.
Elevated GGT indicates high alkaline phosphatase is at least partly due to a hepatic source, if not entirely, and not just secondary to bony involvement of his prostate cancer.
Pt remains jaundiced with elevated direct bilirubin to 10 and positive asterixis.
RUQ U/s negative for stentable lesions but positive for metastatic disease.
Lactulose was started although subsequently stopped after prolonged period of constipation and high residuals.
##[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay: He was transferred to ICU on [**2170-10-15**] for hypotension, tachycardia, worsening anemia and acute renal failure (creatinine 1-->1.8).
Patient was found to be hypotensive at 10/6 at 4 am with systolic blood pressure in the mid 80s and HR 120s.
He was given a total of 1500 cc of fluid and bp improved to high 80s systolic.
Patient's temperature was 99.3 but he was on steroids for bony mets and pain control.
No recent procedures except for multiple bladder manipulations by urology for clotted catheters.
Pt has CBI with hematuria in foley.
The hypotension was likely due to hypovolemia from blood loss.
Transferred again to ICU on [**10-26**] due to hypotension in context of 1 out of 4 positive blood cultures with coag negative staph.
Also given 2U pRBCs due to low hematocrit.
Developed hypotension and tachycardia, treated with IV fluids, PRBCs, and started on pressors.
He grew Klebsiella out of his blood and sputum and enterococcus out of his blood.
