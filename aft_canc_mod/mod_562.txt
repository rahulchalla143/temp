He felt her speech was dysarthric, but felt that there was no focal weakness, sensory changes, HA, VC, ataxia, trouble understanding or expressing language, or any B/B incontinence.

Inattentive, cannot say DOW forewards or backwards.
Visual fields seem to show a L VF deficit (she has poor BTT coming from the left).
Palate elevation symmetrical.
No observed myoclonus or tremor Not completely cooperative with full strength testing, but within this context, appears to have full strength in the UE and in the LE at the IP, Ham and Quad, with the exception of perhaps 5-/5 in the Left Ham (though could be [**1-12**] inattention.
(+) extinction to DSS on the L.  Reflexes: +2 and symmetric throughout except at patellae which were 0 (though again, not relaxing enough for appropriate testing) Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: Able to do finger to nose x 1 without clear ataxia or dysmetria.

[**2178-7-9**] MRI brain: FINDINGS: There are multifocal areas of high T2/FLAIR signal intensity within the supra and infratentorial compartments, with large areas of abnormality involving the posterior right temporal and medial left temporal lobes.
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures.
No discrete mass is identified, though assessment is limited as there were no post- contrast imaging.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally aerated.
On MRA, the carotid and vertebral arteries appear within normal limits without evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm formation.
Multifocal infarcts within the supra and infratentorial compartments, including watershed regions.
These findings most likely represent embolic infarcts, as the vasculature appears patent without stenosis or occlusion.
Limited assessment for intracranial metastases as no post-contrast images were obtained, as detailed.
New parenchymal hemorrhage of the medial left temporal lobe, which may be hemorrhagic transformation in the region of the infarct on MRI [**2178-7-9**] or may be due to trauma.
Probable parenchymal hemorrhage of the right temporal lobe and left cerebellar hemisphere.
Multiple foci of supratentorial hemorrhage, some subarachnoid in location, others may be parenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Although most of the areas of enhancing lesions are likely due to infarcts, small associated metastatic lesion would be difficult to evaluate .
A followup MRI can help to exclude associated tiny metastatic lesions.
Largest area of ischemia/infarction in the right temporoparietal region demonstrates an approximately 1 cm focus of hyperdensity consistent with a small focus of hemorrhage.
[**2178-7-13**] transthoracic echocardiogram; The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %) (?related to the tachycardia).
Systolic function of apical segments is relatively preserved (suggesting a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-7-8**], the heart rate is much higher and the global LVEF is now mildly depressed.
The severity of mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation have increased.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 13834**] is a 68 yo F, of unclear handedness, hx of DM2, HTN, HLD, prior DVT, CRF, and metastatic endometrial CA, s/p recent onset of taxol/carboplatin chemo, received her second cycle of chemo [**7-2**] and since then has been acting "disoriented" per her son, who today was found on the ground in with more substantial MS changes and dysarthria.
Her NCHCT shows a L-PCA territory hypodensity as well as a L cerebellar hypodensity most c/w a subacute stroke.
She also was found to have acute-on-chronic renal failure, mild hyperkalemia, and a thrombocytopenia at the time of admission.
It was thought she did not have any evidence of acute coronary syndrome and the troponin leak may have been due to imbalance of the autonomic nervous system with excessive sympathetic activity and catecholamine release secondary to her stroke vs. demand ischemia, and possibly also contributed from her renal failure.
For her likely embolic strokes, she was continued on lovenox and was deemed not to be an aspirin candidate due to her thrombocytopenia (platelet count in 30s-40s).
A repeat CT head on [**7-10**] revealed new parenchymal hemorrhage of the medial right temporal lobe.
This may be hemorrhagic transformation in the region of infarct on MRI [**2178-7-9**] or due to trauma.
Multiple foci of possible subarachnoid or intraparenchymal hemorrhage were seen on the [**7-10**] Head CT.
However, subsequent MRI brain on [**7-12**] did not corroborate these areas of possible subarachnoid or intraparenchymal bleed.
The patient could not provide any history but had no complaints when examined and denied headache or neck pain.
She was transferred to the neuro ICU, lovenox was discontinued, and she was transfused platelets, fresh frozen plasma, and started on keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
She became hypotensive (SBP down to 60s), requiring three pressors, and intubated.
Her lactate was rising, renal failure worsening with very little urine output, and anemia and thrombocytopenia were worsening as well.
There was question of SVT vs. atrial fibrillation on telemetry and EKG, and she was started on diltiazem gtt for 1 hour.
She was tachycardic after receiving Atropine.
No spontaneous movement of her extremities, she does not withdraw any extremity to noxious.
