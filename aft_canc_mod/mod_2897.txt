He was also found at the time to have a pulmonary embolus and bulky right hilar lymphadenopathy.
Bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy for lymph node biopsy performed on [**12-10**] revealed a poorly differentiated carcinoma on staining, most consistent with a lung large cell malignancy, with invasion of the large vessels.
Staging PET scan showed extensive disseminated FDG-avid disease throughout the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis.
Head MRI showed multiple tiny ring-enhancing lesions throughout the supra and infratentorial compartments highly suspicious for metastatic disease.
Patient admitted [**2140-1-8**] with bilateral malignant pleural effusions that repeatedly recurred post-thoracentesis.
He was sent from [**Hospital1 **] today for obtundation, hypotension, and tachycardia with complaint of shortness of breath and per report, with low grade fevers.
BP dropped to 64/20, cordis placed into his right femoral vein, given total of 4L NS, started on Levophed, seen by cardiology who performed a bedside echocardiogram which showed no evidence of RA/RV collapse.
Patient's breathing appeared labored and he was reportedly more confused with ABG of 7.26/45/131, patient was intubated for respiratory distress, acidosis and airway protection with his worsening mental status.
CXR showed pulmonary edema.

Stable large pericardial effusion, with nodularity along the anterior and superior aspect of the pericardium.
2) Bibasilar atelectasis and consolidation.
Additional atelectasis within the lingula.
4) Emphysematous changes and diffuse intralobular septal thickening and nodularity, suggestive of lymphangitic spread of tumor.
Brief Hospital Course: 56 year-old male with metastatic large cell lung cancer, h/o pericardial tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis and window, malignant pleural effusion s/p talc pleurodesis, pulmonary embolus, now presents with altered mental status, respiratory distress, and hypotension.
Patient was intubated (as noted), started on levophed to maintain blood pressure, however, and patient was thought to be in sepsis with respiratory compromise from recurrent pleural effusion.
Patient was found to have enlarged right pleural effusion, with stable left, and pulsus paradoxicus of 10 (similar to last admission).
In addition, patient had intermittent episodes of tachycardia to 190s, thought to be secondary to myocardial irritability as a result of residual malignant pericardial effusion.
However, given his progressive and rapid clinical decline (including now lymphangitic spread of NSCLC) despite chemotherapy, a discussion was held between the patient's primary oncology fellow and the patient's family with regard to goals of care.
