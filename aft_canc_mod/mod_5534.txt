She had GTR of her L frontal met on  [**12-7**], with a good improvement of her transcortical motor aphasia; Admitted for elective craniotomy  Past Medical History: CHF with EF 40-55% mitral valve regurgitation HTN anemia related to folate and iron defic factor [**Month/Year (2) **] deficiency renal cell cancer diagnosed in [**8-26**] with a left renal mass, presented with LE swelling.
Now s/p L nephrectomy and adrenalectomy [**9-26**], pathology showing renal cell.
CHF with EF 40-55% mitral valve regurgitation HTN anemia related to folate and iron defic factor [**Last Name (STitle) **] deficiency  Social History: Lives with husband and son, HS education; formerly worked at [**Male First Name (un) 28447**] club/sales, quit tob 30 yrs ago, formerly smoked <1pd x 10 yrs, former etoh, no drugs, no toxic exposures  Family History: son with sz d/o, father d. lung ca with mets to brain; mother d. stroke, sister with cervical ca, brother with cad   Physical Exam: VITAL SIGNS: VSS GENERAL: She is alert, pleasant, cachectic, middle-aged woman, in no acute distress.
She is mildly inattentive.
She had positive right-left disorientation.
Her exam was orientated X2, following commands with word finding difficulty and right sided weakness.
She was transferred to the floor on day 1 she continued perservation/word finding difficulties had a right pronator drift.
Transvaginal examination was not attempted as the patient was unable to give consent secondary to mental status change.
The uterus is heterogeneous and enlarged measuring 8.9 x 7.0 x 8.5 cm.
There are several large hypoechoic masses consistent with fibroids, the largest located in the mid uterus measuring 3.4 x 3.5 x 3.9 cm.
Superior to the uterine fundus, there is a mixed solid-cystic lesion measuring 3.6 x 2.7 x 3.9 cm.
The origin and etiology of this mass is unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) **] other lesions are identified.
There is no free pelvic fluid.
A 1.5 cm thin- walled anechoic simple cyst is seen within the mid right kidney.
There is no evidence of calculi or hydronephrosis.
No tumor recurrence is seen within the visualized surgical bed.
The GYN service did not see the patient, they felt that the bleeding was related to endometrial thickening and did not warrent an inpatient consult and she should follow up as an outpatient.
A follow up MRI showed: The present study shows high T1 signal, apparently blood products, within the left frontal metastatic tumor resection bed.
Given the appearance of the mass on the prior studies, the enhancement raises the possibility of residual tumor.
There are additional, somewhat gyral shaped areas of contrast enhancement subjacent to the craniotomy flap and extending towards the left frontal tumor resection bed.
Thus, either altered vascular status secondary to the recent resection, leptomeningeal tumor and/or infection all have to be considered in the differential diagnosis of this finding.
The degree of mass effect upon the adjacent left lateral ventricle appears unaltered.
It is very difficult to demonstrate the enhancement of the left cerebellar lesion at this time, and this enhancement is only faintly discernible on the coronal and possibly the sagittal post-contrast images as well.
The edema associated with both lesions is re-demonstrated, as are the numerous punctate areas of elevated FLAIR signal within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, probably representing chronic small vessel infarcts.
The present study shows susceptibility within the left cerebellar metastasis, raising the question of interval hemorrhage compared to the prior susceptibility scan of [**11-14**], [**2187**] (more recent intervening MR studies did not have a susceptibility sequence).
The size of this susceptibility area conforms to the previously noted area of contrast enhancement at this locale.
Finally, there is re-demonstration of what is likely a 1 cm right maxillary antral mucous retention cyst.
This has improved and should continue to do so as edema from surgery resolves.
