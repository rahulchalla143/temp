Admission Date:  [**2175-12-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2175-12-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2092-8-31**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Atorvastatin / Celebrex  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: The patient is an 83-year-old woman with chronic diastolic CHF (LVH, EF 75%), chronic atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, severe pulmonary hypertension, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and metastatic thyroid cancer undergoing cyberknife therapy, who presents to the ED today with complaints of 20-pound weight gain over the last two weeks and increasing shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and PND.
She denies any palpitations, presyncope, or syncope.
She complained of progressive symptoms and was referred in to the ED for further evaluation.
CXR showed no significant effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation.
She received Ceftriaxone as empiric coverage given concern for sepsis contributing to her hypotension and possible underlying pneumonia.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.

Family History: Father with coronary artery disease, Two children and five grandchildren alive and healthy Daughter with hyperthyroidism  Physical Exam: VS: afeb, BP= 90s/40s, HR= 110s-130s, RR= 14-18, O2 sat= 96-99% NRB GENERAL: WD/WN elderly woman in moderate respiratory distress.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
Large firm multinodular mass in the thyroid area.
Tachycardia sensitive to Carotid Sinus Massage.
+[**2-16**] HSM at apex.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Resp tachypneic but unlabored, mild accessory muscle use.
+Crackles and decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.
No rhonchi or wheezes.
Mildly obese.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Fluently conversant w/ no focal neurologic abnormalities.
EKG [**2175-12-11**] Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Right axis deviation.
Persistent prominent S waves in the left precordial leads.
Modest right precordial lead T wave changes.
Findings are consistent with right ventricular hypertrophy/right ventricular overload.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
TTE [**2175-12-12**] IMPRESSION: Markedly dilated right ventricle with moderate global hypokinesis and relative sparing of the basal right ventricular segments.
Preserved left ventricular regional and global systolic function.
Severe diastolic dysfunction.
Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.
Mild aortic and moderate mitral regurgitation.
RADIOLOGY: CXR ([**2175-12-12**]): FINDINGS: Large right thyroid masses again appreciated with calcification and leftward deviation of the trachea.
Numerous rounded masses within the chest bilaterally are again depicted consistent with known metastatic disease.
No significant effusion or pneumothorax is detected.
Double density with regard to the cardiac shadow is consistent with a large hiatal hernia.
No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia is detected.
No pulmonary embolism.
Large pulmonary artery measuring 3.4 cm, greater than the aorta.
Septal thickening consistent with fluid overload.
Large pleural effusions, right greater than left, much worse than in [**Month (only) **].
Significant right and left lower lobe atelectasis.
Numerous metastatic pulmonary nodules as before.
CT Chest ([**12-21**]): pending   Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 83-yo woman w/ chronic dCHF (LVH, EF 75%), chronic A-fib on anticoagulation, severe pulm HTN, DM, HTN, HL, and metastatic thyroid Ca s/p CyberKnife therapy, p/w 20-pound weight gain x2 weeks and progressively worsening SOB and DOE, found to be in A-fib w/ RVR in the ED, hypotensive, and hypoxic, admitted to the CCU, improved w diuresis and transferred temporarily to regular floor.
Readmitted to CCU for hypercarbic respiratory failure improved on BiPaP.
# Hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure: Multiple potential etiologies, in part secondary to her hypervolemia as well as known pulmonary hypertension, cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
Considered tapping pleural effusions, but determined to be technically difficult as the patient had elevated INR.
PUMP: Pt w/ known chronic dCHF (LVH and EF 75%), p/w acute exacerbation in the setting of afib with RVR.
TTE showed EF 70-75%, markedly dilated RV w/ moderate global HK, preserved LV regional and global systolic function, severe diastolic dysfunction, moderate to severe pulmonary hypertenion.
Given hypotension and mild acute renal failure, lasix drip was continued with 1-1.5 L net diuresis daily.
With improvement in her volume status, she was transferred to the regular floor, however, readmitted to CCU for hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
Pt i/o slightly net negative, but unable to adequately diurese secondary to hypotension.
# RHYTHM: Pt was noted to have chronic atrial fibrillation, no previous attempts at cardioversion.
She was in a-Fib w/ RVR on presentation to ED, w/ hypotension as below, in setting of worsening symptoms since stopping Digoxin and uptitrating Toprol XL.
Low TSH also suggested a contribution of thyrotoxicity secondary to CyberKnife therapy for thyroid cancer.
# HYPOTENSION: Pt w/ SBP 80s-90s in ED in the setting of RVR, and neosynephrine  was started for BP support while on rate-controlling agents.
She was briefly febrile, but no infection was identified and sepsis was considered unlikely.
Random cortisol was high, ruling out adrenal insufficiency as a cause.
Hypotension was attributed to  poor forward flow from acute on chronic diastolic CHF and A-Fib/RVR.
Now low normal BP with fluctuating mentation.
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Likely [**1-15**] poor forward flow from A-Fib/RVR.
Urine lytes c/w prerenal physiology.
Renal following.
# DIABETES: On oral meds at home for glycemic control.
# CROHN'S DISEASE: continued home Pentasa, PPI.
# SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR: Pt on coumadin for a-fib, but INR now > 6, unclear etiology.
