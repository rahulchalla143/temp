Admission Date:  [**2109-1-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2109-2-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2050-12-22**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Augmentin / Trimethoprim / Macrolide Antibiotics  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3016**] Chief Complaint: Nausea/vomiting  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 58 yo F with recurrent stage IIIA NSCLC s/p carboplatin and pemetrexed on [**2108-12-26**] and recent admission here for gastroparesis who presented 2 days after discharge from here to [**Hospital1 1474**] with similar symptoms.
Of note, she had an MRI in [**11/2108**] for same concern, which was negative for metastases.
She triggered on arrival to the floor here at [**Hospital1 18**] for HTN to 200/100 HR 110.
HTN likely related to N/V/abdominal pain.
She reported mild epigastric pain.
She was diagnosed with gastroparesis in [**10/2108**] based on a gastric empyting study after presenting N/V.
She denies constipation or diarrhea.
ROS: Denies CP, SOB, palpitations, cough, HA, change in vision, dysuria, myalgias or arthralgias.
Past Medical History: Locoregional Recurrent NSCLC -- [**8-/2103**] presented with several months of persistent cough unresponsive to antibiotics.
-- [**10/2103**] Chest x-ray demonstrated a density in the left mid lung, which was confirmed by a chest CT. -- [**11/2103**] chest CT revealing a 1.8-cm left upper lobe spiculated mass with pleural extension consistent with a malignant neoplasm.
She also had a 2.6-cm right adrenal mass thought to be a simple adenoma as well as a 2.1-cm left lobe focus of nodular hyperplasia in the liver confirmed on an [**2103-11-23**] MRI.
-- [**2104-1-14**], she underwent a left upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection with pathology revealing adenocarcinoma with bronchioalveolar features well-to-moderately differentiated in a 1.5 cm tumor.
She had lymphovascular invasion and one of three peribronchial lymph nodes was positive.
There was also a tumor in the periaortic lymph node in the AP window region giving her a T1 N2 stage IIIA nonsmall cell lung cancer adenocarcinoma.
-- [**2-/2104**] She was treated postoperatively with one cycle of paclitaxel and carboplatin, but was hospitalized post infusion on [**2104-2-22**] with chest pain, which was a ST elevation MI.
She underwent emergent catheterization with a 60% LAD stenosis for which she got a Cypher drug-eluting stent.
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **] [**2107-5-2**] CT with no evidence of recurrence, although a small nodule is noted in the left lower lobe measuring 3 mm, which had not been reliably demonstrated on the prior study.
No mediastinal adenopathy reported on the [**2107**] scan.
She underwent an EGD with gastritis and gastric emptying study consistent with gastroparesis.
-- [**2108-10-25**] CT which confirmed a new soft tissue abnormality in the left mediastinum starting just distal to the aortic arch associated with abnormal density surrounding the left main bronchus posteriorly and small lymph nodes in the left hilum suspicious for lung cancer recurrence.
She also had a small pericardial effusion, a 2-mm right upper lobe nodule with associated ground-glass opacity.
Again, seen was a 2.5-cm adrenal lesion and a right hepatic lobe lesion.
She also underwent on [**2108-10-25**] an MRI of her L-spine, which was stopped for pain, but did not show metastatic involvement.
-- [**2108-10-26**], she underwent a bronchoscopy with EBUS, which showed a station 4L lymph node positive for malignant cells consistent with nonsmall cell cancer.
The left main stem bronchus biopsy was only notable for bronchial mucosa and a level 7 node was negative.
-- [**2108-11-7**] PET CT on [**2108-11-7**], which confirmed a PET avid paratracheal soft tissue density with an SUV of 6.7; a left hilar mass along the left main stem bronchus, which was also PET avid at SUV of 4.9; and a non PET-avid 6-mm right hilar lymph node; and 3-mm right lower lobe subpleural nodule.
There was no FDG avidity seen outside of the chest and her adrenal mass is non PET-avid.
-- [**2108-11-17**] MRI Brain: Subtle enhancement in the left parietal leptomeningeal area felt to represent a tiny vascular lesion like a cavernoma.
There is also question of an enhancing lesion in the left cerebellum but without associated mass effect or edema.
-- [**2108-12-1**] Chest CT with slight interval increase in adenopathy, no new findings.
OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: CAD s/p STEMI during paclitaxel, s/p Cypher drug-eluting stent to the LAD on [**2104-2-22**] Fibromyalgia History of pneumonia Uterine fibroids status post fibroidectomy COPD Incisional hernia Adrenal adenoma Status post appendectomy in [**5-/2105**] Neuropathy along the thoracotomy site History of MVC with head trauma requiring multiple sutures, no reported intracranial pathology  Social History: She lives alone.

Interval enlargement of ill-defined contrast enhancement in the anterior inferior left cerebellar hemisphere, most suggestive of progressing metastatic disease, which could be leptomeningeal and/or parenchymal.
Stable small focus of cortical contrast enhancement, with a possible leptomeningeal component, in the parasagittal left parietal region, which could represent a stable metastasis, or a vascular malformation such as a cavernoma.
[**2109-1-30**] CSF ATYPICAL.
Rare single atypical cell, not sufficient for definitive characterization.
[**2109-2-1**] CT Head There is also subtle edema in the left thalamus, which could represent acute ischemia.
No evidence of mesenteric ischemia.
Mild focal narrowing at the origin of the SMA with associated post-stenotic dilatation unlikely of clinical significance with widely patent celiac axis and its major branches.
Fibroid uterus.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE 58yo F with PMH recurrent NSCLC stage IIIA s/p chemo/XRT c/b gastroparesis, a/w persistant N/V, hospital course c/b MICU stay for HTN emergency w IPH, urinary retention, now w well-controlled BP, foley out without retention, no nausea/vomitting, discharged home.
ACTIVE #  HTN: Patient was admitted with recurrent HTN episodes to SBP 220 in setting of vomiting and severe nausea, c/b Intraparenchymal hemorrhage as discussed below.
Upon resolution of above issues, labile BP improved so that patient no longer required anti-HTN medications.
She underwent a workup for pheochromocytoma w negative urine metanephs.
# Gastroparesis w N/V:  Patient with a chronic hx gastroparesis of uncertain etiology ([**2-6**] radiation v chemo v paraneoplastic v narcotics v tumor infiltration).
During hospitalization, patient had improvement in nausea with narrowing of medications (it was thought that baseline nausea was being exacerbated by large amount of medications she was receiving).
# Urinary Retention: During her hospitalization, patient was found to be retaining large amount of urine and had a foley placed.
# s/p ICH: As mentioned above, on [**2-1**], in setting of HTN urgency, patient found to have 1.8cm basal ganglia bleed on CT. Neurosurg evaluated and felt that no surgical evacuation was needed.
# NSCLC:  Patient w history of NSCLC w metastases.
Imaging demonstrated stable metastases, with suspected brain met, but LP showed only 1 atypical cell.
# Thrush: Patient found to have thrush during admission, thought to be [**2-6**] inhaled steriod use.
