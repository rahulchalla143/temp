Admission Date:  [**2127-1-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-1-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2080-6-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: adhesive  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12**] Chief Complaint: confusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 46y/o lady with metastatic melanoma who was admitted with prolonged confusion after seizure.
She was initially diagnosed with melanoma in [**2102**] after the biopsy of a lesion on her abdomen, for which she underwent surgical resection.
Then in [**2120**], she was found to have metastatic melanoma after the biopsy of a shoulder mass prompted further workup and she was found to have brain and lung mets.
She began having seizures in [**2124**] and was admitted to OMED in [**7-/2126**] for a seizure that was attributed to her brain mets and her Lamotrigine was uptitrated.
She had headaches for which she was admitted to OMED again in [**10/2126**]; these were alleviated for the most part with steroids and whenever she has been tapered from these steroids she has recurrent headache.
She was transferred here as her mental status did not clear, and she was admitted to the ICU with continued altered mental status and transiently unequal pupils (which resolved after admission to the ICU).
In the ICU, her altered mental status was worked up and was presumed to be due to post-ictal state as well as edema.
Rt frontal slowing and cortical slowing.
No overt seizures.
- Initially presented with melanoma in-situ in [**2103**] on her abdominal wall which was resected - [**2120**] re-presented with a L axiallary nodule found to be LN with melanoma and multiple other metastatic sites.
- [**12/2122**], she developed severe intermittent headaches and an MRI showed extensive CNS metastases.

Neck:  No pain with flexion of neck.
Spine:  No spinal or paraspinal TTP Cards: RR S1/S2 normal.
Pulm: No dullness to percussion, CTAB no crackles or wheezes Abd: BS+, soft, NT, no rebound/guarding, no HSM, no [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign Extremities: wwp, no edema.
Skin: no rashes or bruising Neuro: Slowed and slightly slurred speech.
Some difficulty following instructions, but able to after they are repeated.
DISCHARGE EXAM: Vitals: Tm/Tc 98.1/96.8, BP 105/55 (100-120)/(55-70), HR 100 (55-100), RR 18, SaO2 96%RA GEN: NAD CV: S1, S2, no murmur PULM: CTA throughout all fields EXTREM: warm, well-perfused, no edema NEURO: Knows the date and can spell "world" backwards but cannot recite months backwards and does not recognize the examiner.
[**2127-1-6**]: CT head w/o contrast FINDINGS: Multiple mixed attenuation lesions are again noted, including lesions in the cerebellar vermis, posterior right temporal lobe, left posterior frontal lobe, the medial parafalcine left frontal and left parietal lobes, and the right frontal lobe.
There is extensive white matter hypodensity likely related to vasogenic edema and posttreatment changes, similar to [**2127-1-2**].
There an unchanged 3 mm leftward shift of midline structures.
The ventricles are stable in size, with persistent partial effacement of the right lateral ventricle.
There is a right parietal craniotomy.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesion is identified.
Mucosal thickening and a mucus retention cyst are noted in the left maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION: Multiple parenchymal metastases, grossly similar to the [**2127-1-2**] head MRI allowing for differences in modalities, with unchanged 3 mm leftward shift of midline structures.
EEG [**2127-1-7**] This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the presence of right fronto-central rare epileptiform discharges which represent epileptogenic cortex.
It is also abnormal due to the presence of right fronto-central focal slowing which represents a focal subcortical dysfunction.
There were no electrographic seizures noted.
Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. [**Known lastname 38170**] is a 46y/o lady who has metastatic melanoma with brain lesions, edema, and midline shift and presented after seizures with continued altered mental status.
During her stay, she was continued on steroids and an uptitrated antiepileptic regimen.
She had no more seizures and her mental status improved somewhat, so she was discharged home with service with close follow-up.
# Seizures/Altered Mental Status: likely due to brain mets and edema.
She had transiently unequal pupils but this resolved with no further interventions.
On recent MRI, her cerebral edema seems worse than before.
EEG confirms evidence of seizure activity.
While her level of attention improved during her stay, she still remained confused and had poor recall.
# Melanoma: metastatic to brain and lung.
She was very depressed about being in the hospital away from her family.
She has been on Escitalopram 10mg daily with some relief; she does report recent restless legs which are a possible side effect of SSRIs in general.
5. zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
6. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
8. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.

Disp:*90 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: VNA of Southeastern Mass  Discharge Diagnosis: seizures due to metastatic melanoma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
The seizures are likely due to brain swelling and brain metastases from your metastatic melanoma.
