Admission Date:  [**2198-4-14**]              [**Month/Day/Year **] Date:   [**2198-4-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2143-12-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IVC filter placement Right IJ central line placement and removal RUE PICC placement   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 33754**] is a 54-year-old woman with history of CNS lymphoma who presents with increasing seizures and hypotension.
She is bedbound at baseline, with chronic indwelling Foley, and lives with her husband who cares for her.
For the past 9 months, she has been having intermittent "attacks" consisting of eyes rolling back in her head and losing consciousness for approximately 30 seconds up to 5 minutes that consistently happen in association with positional changes.
Also, for the past 3 weeks, she has been "not herself," more confused compared to her baseline (which is oriented and coherent but with some word finding difficulties).
For the past week, she has been feeling generally not well, been more anorexic than usual, and had several episodes of nausea with nonbilious vomitting.
Review of systems was negative for recent fevers (had some fevers in [**2198-2-21**] and was treated as an outpatietn for UTI, none since).
There was no change in urine output or appearance of urine.
She had no cough, shortness of breath, chest pain.
She also did not have change in bowel movements or blood in bowel movements.
She was noted to have a positive urinalysis.
CT chest/abdomen with contrast was negative for PE but did show right thigh hematoma.
Past Medical History: - CNS Lymphoma, diagnosed by brain biopsy [**2197-6-2**] (path demonstrated large B-cell lymphoma); s/p 4 induction cycle of high-dose methotrexate ([**2197-6-5**]); she developed progressive disease that required the addition of rituximab to high-dose methotrexate but she progressed further; she later had whole brain cranial irradiation to 3,600 cGy completed on [**2197-7-27**]; she had a near total response on repeat head MRI on [**2197-7-26**].
- Right upper extremity DVT (PICC-related) in [**2197-6-23**] - Pulmonary embolism in [**2197-9-23**] - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Oophorectomy at young age  Social History: She lives with husband.
Family History: Her father is alive with diabetes and s/p coronary stent placement.
General:  She appears well, sitting up, awake and alert HEENT:  Right IJ in place, clean and dry Heart:  Regular, no murmurs Lungs:  Clear bilaterally Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, mild suprapubic tenderness, no rebound or guarding Back:  No CVA tenderness Extremities:  They are warm, strong distal pulses, no tenderness in thighs, 3+ LLE edema, no RLE edema, sensation intact  Neurological Examination:  Her Karnofsky Performance Score is 50.
Her muscle strengths are [**3-27**] in the left upper extremity, and 4-/5 in proximal left lower extremity and [**3-27**] in distal left lower extremity.
Her right upper extremity strength is about [**2-25**] while it is [**1-25**] in proximal right lower extremity and 4+/5 in distal right lower extremity.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Known left basal ganglia lesion not well characterized on this noncontrast study.
Probable hematoma in the right buttock and right obturator externus muscle (medial right upper thigh).
Diffuse osteopenia with generalized body wall atrophy.
No pulmonary embolism.
New small-to-moderate left pleural effusion.
Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.
Mild rectal wall thickening, ??
Similar size to hematoma with increase in density upon contrast administration raising the possibility of active extravasation.
An underlying mass is not excluded and recommend followup imaging study once treated.
Rectum not fully assessed in this study but prior suggestion of proctitis not totally excluded.
Persistent small simple free fluid in the pelvis.
Diffuse demineralization.
Suboptimal bolus to assess for venous thrombosis but no thrombus in proximal common and superfical femoral veins.
No diastolic LV dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, or clinically-significant valvular disease seen.
Left pleural effusion  [**2198-4-17**] Lower Extremity Ultrasound IMPRESSION: Right mid and distal superficial femoral vein deep venous thrombus.
[**2198-4-18**] Upper Extremity Ultrasound IMPRESSION: Chronic thrombus within the right cephalic vein.
The remainder of the vessels demonstrate no evidence for acute DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 33754**] is a 54-year-old right-handed woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with hypotension.
(1) Hypotension:  Differential included distributive (sepsis) vs cardiac vs adrenal insufficiency versus volume depletion.
There was no hypoxia to suggest PE, and had a negative CTA in the ED.
Another possibility was volume depletion, possibly secondary to blood loss into her thigh.
Most likely possibility was thought to be sepsis, possibly urosepsis given positive urinalysis in the ED and chronic indwelling urinary catheter.
Her hypotension was very fluid responsive, and levophed was weaned within hours of admission.
She was treated for presumed sepsis with aggressive fluid resuscitation to maintain MAP >65, although CVP was persistently at 0.
Vancomycin was discontinued when cx were no growth.
Hypotension was completely resolved on the floor for greater than 5 days prior to [**Known lastname **] and she remained normotensive with SBP 110's to 120's.
(2) Episodic Loss of Consciousness:  This was attributed to seizures by her husband and apparently by her neuro-oncologist, who recently increased her Keppra dosing to control this.
Also possible, she was orthostatic (given that episodes are reproducible with positional changes) and in the setting of worsening baseline hypotension recently has become more symptomatic.
CT head negative for acute change.
Neuro-oncology followed and did not recommend EEG or other further testing.
(3) Right Thigh Hematoma/Anemia:  Right obturator hematoma visualized on CT from the ED.
Anticoagulation with lovenox was continued initially given the small appearance of hematoma but stopped after the first day because of unstable Hct.
Repeat CT showed stable 8 cm hematoma with a question of an underlying mass.
There were no signs of compartment syndrome.
She was transfused for symptoms and to maintain HCT >24.
(4) History of DVT/PE:  LLE DVT with PE was diagnosed in [**2197-9-23**], with ongoing LLE edema.
LENIs were done, and she was found to have a RLE superficial femoral clot.
Likely secondary to elevated lactate (8.0).
She later developed a non-gap acidosis, likely secondary to normal saline, which was subsequently changed to lactated Ringer.
(6) Elevated Troponin:  She had flat CK, likely secondary to demand and hypotension.
EKG in the ED with ST depressions laterally new since [**2197-9-23**].
(7) Thrombocytopenia:  Patient had thrombocytopenia which trended down during admission, 41K on [**Year (4 digits) **], felt to be consistent with timing of side effect from temodar.
Hematology was consulted and did not feel timing was consistent with HIT or labs were consistent with DIC or TTP.
Nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for thrush for 7 days.
[**Telephone/Fax (1) **] Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7665**]  [**Hospital3 **] Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis Hypotension CNS lymphoma Deep venous Thrombosis Obturator hematoma Thrombocytopenia  [**Hospital3 **] Condition: Hemodynamically stable, afebrile >1 week and off antibiotics  [**Hospital3 **] Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with low blood pressure.
This was felt to be from an infection or from bleeding into your hip.
We stopped your lovenox since this thins the blood and you had a filter placed to prevent blood clots from going from your legs to your lungs.
You were also transfused blood for low blood counts.
We treated you with antibiotics for 1 week for a possible urinary tract infection.
We added Percocet, Zofran, and Compazine as needed for pain or nausea  Please return to the ER or call your primary care doctor if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, fever>101, chills, dizziness, lightheadedness, headache or any other concerning symptoms.
