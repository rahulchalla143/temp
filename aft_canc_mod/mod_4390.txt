Admission Date:  [**2183-10-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2183-11-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2123-4-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Back pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar Embolization  L1 vertebrectomy/resection of tumor with T10 to L3 thoracolumbar fusion/instrumentation   History of Present Illness: 60 female admitted after imaging at OSH revealing an L1 compression fracture and a renal mass extending into the L renal vein to the IVC and into the right atrium.
She reports dyspnea, back pain, leg weakness with exertion, leg swelling, transient hematuria, & constipation.. She denies any HA, CP, abdominal pain, diarrhea, melena, hematochezia.
She also reports that her exercise tolerance has decreased on account of her leg pain.
She says that she is not limited by her back pain of dyspnea, but that her legs "give out".
Past Medical History: Epilepsy Hypothyroidism Depression HT Glaucoma   Social History: Smoking: 15pk year history stopped in [**2182**], no alcohol use  Married with 2 children, worked as machine operator until [**Month (only) 547**] when she fx wrist in auto accident.
Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: 98.4 71 114/74 18 100% RA NAD, A&Ox3, comfortable, pain controlled.
Collapse of the L1 vertebral body with retropulsion of bony fragments into the canal, with probable severe cord compression.
Left-sided paraspinal mass, and mass in the left renal fossa.
Hyperdense focus in the left basal ganglia, with enhancement.
Lack of mass effect and edema is more suggestive of a cavernoma than a metastasis, but an MRI is recommended in order to evaluate further and to better characterize the lesion.
Surgical clip along the posterior aspect of the left maxillary sinus, possibly due to prior surgical treatment for hemorrhage.
A large (4x6.5 cm), mobile mass with a large cyst is seen in the right atrium, probably starting in the IVC, filling almost all of the right atrrium,  prolapsing through the tricuspid valve, and into the right ventricle.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity  size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**2183-10-31**] 3:21 PM IMPRESSION: Small focus of chronic blood products and enhancement in the left subinsular region adjacent to the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle as described above.
The differential diagnosis is between cavernous angioma and a metastatic disease given the patient's clinical history of a renal cell cancer.
The MRI appearances and the presence of developmental venous anomaly in the adjacent brain favor cavernous malformation as suggested on the previous CT.
No evidence of vascular occlusion or high-grade stenosis is seen in the arteries of anterior and posterior circulation.
IMPRESSION: Motion limited head MRA demonstrates no evidence of vascular occlusion.
Very large left renal mass with multiple associated bulky retroperitoneal, adrenal, and left paraspinal metastases.
This is again most consistent with renal cell carcinoma.
Destruction of the L1 vertebral body with associated epidural disease compressing the spinal canal superiorly at this level.
Extensive tumor thrombus within the inferior vena cava extending into the right atrium and crossing the tricuspid valve.
Evidence of pulmonary metastases with largest mass demonstrated in the right middle lobe.
Bilateral pleural effusions, ascites, and anasarca.
Technically successful fine needle aspiration and core biopsy of large left renal mass.
Mild spondylytic changes, without evidence of osseous metastatic disease in the cervical spine.
CT T-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2183-11-1**] 12:12 PM IMPRESSION: Allowing for differences in technique compared to the prior MR, similar appearance of compression fracture of L1 with associated enhancing soft tissue mass.
There is probably similar severe canal stenosis as well as involvement of the left-sided neural foramina at T12-L1 and L1-L2.
CT L-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2183-11-1**] 12:12 PM IMPRESSION: Allowing for differences in technique compared to the prior MR, similar appearance of compression fracture of L1 with associated enhancing soft tissue mass.
There is probably similar severe canal stenosis as well as involvement of the left-sided neural foramina at T12-L1 and L1-L2.
L1 compression fracture and mass consistent with the patient's known osseous metastasis.
XRAY L SPINE [**2183-11-9**] Standing L-Spine; Hardware intact, no shift  Brief Hospital Course: 60 YO F with newly diagnosed metastatic renal CA and pathologic with L1 compression fx and pain control.
PCA was transitioned to po pain med.
She has an old cavernous hemangioma that has been followed and is stable.
- TLSO brace: Patient has been fitted and will require brace when OOB or greater than 30 degrees in bed.
- Morphine for breakthrough pain.
Renal Mass - Most likely renal CA, path pending from recent CT-guided biopsy - Given thrombus/tumor extending into IVC to Right Atrium, patient on heparin gtt .
UTI-pt to be started on bactrim DS 1 tab po bid x 7days starting today 6. vascular recs - R/O dvt- = neg DVT on [**11-6**], will maintian sq heparin and start asa 325mg [**Last Name (un) **] day per dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Polyethylene Glycol 3350 17 g (100%) Packet Sig: One (1) Packet PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Morphine 2 mg/mL Syringe Sig: One (1)  Injection Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for breakthrough pain.
