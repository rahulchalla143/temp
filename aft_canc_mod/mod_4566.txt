No acute fracture.
Visualized portions of paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial mass effect to suggest underlying mass.
Note that CT has limited sensitivity for detection of metastasis and MR can be obtained as clinically indicated.
No overt mass effect is seen from these admittedly small lesions.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] calling the housetaff to inform them of this amended finding, and also to inquire as to whether there are any known vascular disease risk factors that may predispose this patient to infarction.
There is mild atherosclerotic calcification of the distal right vertebral artery, and to a minimal degree, the distal left vertebral artery, both at the level of the foramen magnum as well as the cavernous internal carotid arteries.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  57 year-old man with newly diagnosed metastatic cholangiocarcinoma admitted with tachycardia and hypotension, found to be in AVNRT.
There was originally concern for PE in setting of malignancy; a head CT was done (initial read showing no mets) and patient was guiac negative so a heparin ggt was started.
However, upon transfer to the ICU, diagnosis of PE was deemed unlikely and heparin ggt was stopped.
#  Leukocytosis:  In the setting of previous hypotension and hypothermia, there was initial concern for infection.
However, there was no left shift or localizing signs of infection, and WBC count went down to 8.4 on second hospital day.
We continued to monitor WBC and fever curve and held off on antibiotics as patient was clinically stable.
Blood cultures were pending upon discharge and urine culture showed no growth.
Patient was put on bowel regimen and given subcu heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
