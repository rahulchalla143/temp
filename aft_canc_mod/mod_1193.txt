Admission Date:  [**2151-5-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-6-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2081-11-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12**] Chief Complaint: Diarrhea, Weakness, Anemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Port-a-cath placement.
History of Present Illness: 69 yo F with h/o Anaplastic large cell lymphoma and granuloma annulare who presents with fatigue and weakness x 2-3 days.
Pt is poor historian but notes weakness x 2-3 days.
She also notes loose stools over this time period.
Per the patient's son, she has had no PO intake and has not got OOB x 2 weeks.
In [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to have diarrhea and poor rectal tone, neuro consulted.
--CT head-multiple lytic lesions seen in the right parietal and both occipital bones.
--CT C-spine - Multiple lytic lesions seen in the occipital bones bilaterally and lateral mass of C1 --MRI L-spine - Degenerative changes seen in the lower lumbar spine with no evidence of nerve root compression.
Diffuse mottled appearance seen within the vertebral bodies, the sacrum, and both iliac bones is nonspecific in etiology.
This can be seen in diffuse osteopenia, myeloproliferative or lymphomatous involvement of the osseous structures.
She also had elevated LFTs: --RUQ US - Multiple ill-defined small hypoechoic lesions throughout the right lobe of the liver and surrounding the gallbladder fossa.
--CT ABD - Diffuse stranding in the mesentery, which could suggest infiltration by neoplastic process or fluid.
cord compression and hypotension with anemia.
Found to be OB neg, received 4 units PRBC and ruled out for cord compression.
In addition, pt found to have PNA with hx of exposure to Pertussis.
CHEST: Decreased BS at b/l bases.
No rales or wheezes appreciated.
No masses appreciated.
L inguinal LAD with skin changes.
4-5 cm ulcerative lesion on R calf with surrounding erythema and lichenifcation of skin.
Pertinent Results: CXR [**2151-5-20**]: FINDINGS: There is interval increase in the left retrocardiac opacity with associated left pleural effusion.
There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature, suggestive of mild CHF.
No pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION: Left retrocardiac opacity and associated left pleural effusion, which is increased in comparison to the prior study, likely representing an evolving pneumonia.
There is mild prominence of the pulmonary vasculature, suggestive of associated mild CHF.
CT Head: FINDINGS: No previous examination available for comparison.
No intracranial masses effect and no hemorrhage is seen.
No findings to suggest an acute territorial infarction are noted.
Bone windows demonstrated lytic lesion seen in the left parietal skull measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter.
Multiple additional lytic lesions are seen in the occipital bones bilaterally.
RUQ ultrasound: IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, or choledocholithiasis.
Tiny comet tail artifact likely secondary to an adherent crystal versus a small cholesterol polyp.
2) Multiple ill-defined small hypoechoic lesions throughout the right lobe of the liver and surrounding the gallbladder fossa.
These may be secondary to focal fatty sparing, however, given the history of lymphoma a CT or MRI is recommended for definitive characterization.
CT pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
2) Diffuse stranding, likely related to third-spacing.
5) Similar appearance of left adnexal cyst.
6) Liver lesions not assessed without intravenous contrast.
Mild mucosal thickening is seen involving both posterior ethmoid sinuses.
Small fluid level is seen within the left sphenoid sinus and inferior left maxillary sinus.
INTERPRETATION: 1) No acute intracranial abnormalities.
2) Multiple lytic lesions seen in the right parietal and both occipital bones, clinical correlation is necessary.
There are echogenic foci within the myometrium.
A rounded left adnexal cyst is seen, measuring approximately 2.4 cm in diameter.
Thickened heterogeneous endometrium.
The differential diagnosis includes endometrial hyperplasia, carcinoma, adenomyosis, or polyp.
Left adnexal cyst.
The ovaries are not clearly identified  Brief Hospital Course: A 69-year-old female with past medical history significant for anaplastic large cell lymphoma, granuloma annulare, who presented with weakness, anemia, and hypertension.
Anaplastic large cell lymphoma:  The patient has been treated in the past with methotrexate successfully.
After the patient had received approximately 14 days of broad-spectrum antibiotics, it was felt that this rising white blood count was likely secondary to reactive leukocytosis.
The patient did not have any abnormal cells on blood smear; however, it was noted that she had new lymphadenopathy on the right side in the inguinal region per pelvic CT.
In addition, progression of her left-sided inguinal adenopathy was noted as the patient developed open draining sores, which she had had on prior admissions prior to treatment with methotrexate.
It was, therefore, felt that the patient's rising white blood counts and symptoms were likely secondary to reactive leukocytosis from her underlying lymphoma.
She had some nausea and vomiting on the first day, which was treated with antiemetics.
The plan will continue with CHOP chemotherapy as the patient will be unable to take methotrexate with pleural effusion seen on CT scan.
Fevers:  The patient was transferred to the medicine floor and subsequently developed fevers up to 101.
The patient's symptoms included tachypnea without shortness of breath.
She denied nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, lightheadedness, dizziness, or headache.
The patient also had a rising white blood cell count associated with fevers with a maximum while blood cell count of 55,000.
of asp pna due to altered MS on admission.
They recommended coverage for Pseudomonas, which would be the only thing that was not covered.
A CT scan was performed which showed bilateral large pleural effusions.
It was felt that the left-sided pleural effusion should be tapped to rule out empyema.
A thoracentesis was performed and the fluid was a transudate with no bacteria seen on Gram stain and no growth on culture.
The patient remained afebrile and at the time of dictation, both Brucella and Bartonella results were negative.
The patient was also ruled out for pertussis by PCR and cultures.
Therefore, it was felt that her fevers and leukocytosis were secondary to a reactive leukocytosis from her lymphoma.
The patient was afebrile after her CHOP chemotherapy and white blood cell count trended down.
Neuro: On admission, the patient was felt to be weak and there was a question of cauda equina syndrome.
The patient was assessed by neurology who felt that her symptoms of weakness and fatigue were likely associated with infection versus metabolic dysfunction.
The patient was found to have a hematocrit of 15 at the time of admission, and after transfusions and treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient's symptoms resolved.
The patient had an MRI as above which showed no evidence of compression.
Neurology signed off as they felt that the patient's symptoms were not secondary to neurologic dysfunction.
They felt that her weakness is secondary to deconditioning.
Anemia: Most likely secondary to inflammatory process with a background of lymphoma.
The patient had no clear source of bleeding initially on admission as well as stools were guaiac negative.
Pt found to have vaginal bleeding on [**6-4**].
Vaginal bleeding:  The patient was noted to have small amounts of vaginal bleeding after the CHOP chemotherapy.
The patient is postmenopausal and has never had the symptoms before.
She did allow a pelvic ultrasound, which showed a thickened heterogeneous endometrium and a left adnexal cyst was also noted.
The patient was educated and counseled about the risks of possible endometrial cancer.
After further discussion with the patient she agreed to had biopsy and further work-up as an outpatient.
Tachycardia: The patient was found to be tachycardic between 100 and 120 during the entire admission.
An Pt has a normal EF, but did have an element of diastolic dysfunction.
The patient should be started on a beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker for another trial after her lymphoma is stabilized.
Pneumonia:  It was felt that the patient had a pneumonia on initial admission to the MICU.
The patient's respiratory status improved after pleural effusion tapped on the left.
It is likely that her bilateral pleural effusions were secondary to volume overload as the patient was anasarcic after fluid resuscitation and transfusions.
Diarrhea: The patient noted on admission that she was having frequent loose bowel movements.
She also had stool cultures sent for ova and parasites, Salmonella, Cyclospora, and Giardia, all of which were negative.
Nutrition:  The patient was found to have an elevated INR on admission, which was felt to be nutritional.
She was noted to have hypoalbuminemia to 2.
Anxiety:  The patient has a history of anxiety and was continued on her Valium during this admission.
The patient also noted to have chronic hyponatremia.
13: Granuloma Annulare: Pt is being followed by dermatology as an outpatient.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Recurrent lymphoma Granulomata Annulare   Discharge Condition: Stable to rehab  Discharge Instructions: Please return to the hospital if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, severe nausea/vomiting or any other severe symtoms.
