Reason for MICU transfer: Hypotension   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central Line placement and removal   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 57655**] is a 63F with a history of melanoma originally diagnosed [**2098**] who is admitted for cycle 1 week 2 of HD IL-2 therapy.
Her melanoma history is pertinent for presenting lesion on left thigh removed [**2096**] but felt benign; two years later it recurred and biopsy was notable for 1.88 mm thick melanoma with microscopic deposits in [**1-15**] senitinel nodes.
She was initially treated with 32 weeks of interferon but course was terminated due to peripheral neuropathy.
She was then observed, and did well for 5 years but re-presented with hip pain; she was ultimately found to have necrosis of the femoral neck (biopsy unrevealing) but also lesions in liver and lung.
She underwent a first treatment cycle [**Date range (1) 69193**], which was complicated by pulmonary edema (two doses held) and toxic encephalopathy (two doses held; mental status improved to baseline).
She developed an erythematous, pruritic rash treated symptomatically, as well as N/V/D.
She also developed ARF with peak creatinine of 2.6 and oliguria.
Finally, she was noted to have CK elevated to 707 and CK-MB elevated to 162 felt to be consistent with myocardititis; these enzymes trended down and she was discharged home, where she reports doing fairly well in the interval time.
She is recovered well from week 1o f theraoy and is here to begin week of HD Il-2 on cycle 1.  Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.

Her dosing schedule was changed to [**Hospital1 **] dosing on day 2 given the previous week's neurotoxicity and other side effects.
She was also placed on telemetry given myocarditis observed during the previous week.
Her IV fluid was maintained at 50 ml/hr given pulmonary edema seen on week 1 however increased back to 75 ml/hr with hyperkalemia and acute renal failure.
Her course was complicated hypotension hypovolemic shock requiring further elevation of the pressor support and ultimately being transferred to ICU for further support on day +5.
She had acute renal failure with peak Cr of 3.0, her urine out put, daily labs were closely monitored and had continuous IVF for support.
She had hypokalemia and hyperkalemia without ECG changes on the telemetry and these were corrected accordingly.
