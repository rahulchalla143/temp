A triphasic CT scan at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2142-10-1**] demonstrated findings consistent with cirrhosis and an arterially- enhancing lesion in the anterior aspect of the right lobe demonstrating peripheral enhancement and that now measured 2.5 cm in maximum dimension.
There was an 8-mm arterially- enhancing focus more peripherally adjacent to the dominant lesion which may represent a satellite lesion or a focus of arteriovenous shunting.
No other liver lesions were noted.The portal vein was patent, and the spleen was not enlarged.There was no evidence of portal hypertension.
He also underwent a chest CT that demonstrated no evidence of pulmonary metastases.
Physical Exam: Vitals:Tmax=98.9,T curr=97.8,HR=88,BP=122/82,RR=20,Sat=94%/RA Gen: Alert and oriented x 3 HEENT:Pupils equally reactive to light,external occular muscles intact,moist mucous mebranes Neck: suppple,no lad,JVP not raised CHEST: slightly decreased breath sounds at the lung bases,diffuse crackles present b/l CVS: N S1S2.NO M/R/G Abd:soft, non tender,slightly distended,no rebound /guarding Incission C/D/I.
No erythema or hematoma present.
Ext:No pedal edema B/l, peripheral pulses palplable  Pertinent Results: [**2142-11-11**] CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS W/CONTRAST: 1.
No acute cardiothoracic process including no evidence of PE.
Post-surgical changes after resection of a liver mass with increase of perihepatic, intraperitoneal, and pelvic free fluid as well as intraperitoneal free air.
Unchanged moderate-to-severe atherosclerotic disease with 3-cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm extending into the common iliac vessels .
Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without signs of pulmonary edema.
On the right, no pleural effusions are seen.
On the left, there is minimal blunting of the costophrenic sinus, potentially suggesting a small pleural effusion.Subsequently, small left basal atelectasis and a retrocardiac atelectasis are seen.
No focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
[**2142-11-12**] CHEST XRAY: Lower lobe atelectasis is worsened and may explain respiratory insufficiency.Lateral aspect left lower chest is excluded from the examination.
On POD2 the patient developed shortness of breath,desaturation(O2sat of 91% on 6LNC) along with some confusion.His cardiac enzymes were negative for ischemia.CT showed atelectasis and effusion and was negative for PE.He was transferred to the ICU for the event.His urine output as well as SBP were stable during the POD2.
On POD3, the patient's foley was D/Ced, and the patient had 2 episode of urinary incontinance.
Keeping his history of low urine output in consideration, his foley was replaced for UOP charting.After an uneventful POD3,he was transferred back to the floor from the ICU.
