His hospital course by problem is as follows:  Neuro: His CTA showed Total occlusion of the left internal carotid artery, marked stenosis at the right common carotid artery bifurcation and occlusion of the proximal right vertebral artery.
His perfusion studies showed a prolonged mean transit time consistent with left middle cerebral arterial territory ischemia.
Outside hospital MRI was reviewed, and confirmed small cortical subacute infarcts in the MCA distribution.
It was discussed with him that the likely mechanism for his symptoms was a stroke due to total occlusion of the right ICA.
He continued to have BRBPR and after discussion anticoagulation was stopped and he was started on Aggrenox (no sxs of angina)  His blood pressure was target at SBP 120-180.
His Zocor was kept at 80mg and not decreased given concern for potential increased risk of stroke after reductions in statin dose.
He was also monitored on tele without events and ruled out for an MI with CE x 3.
A TTE was negative for a PFO and his repeat Carotid dopplers showed 80 to 99% stenosis of the R ICA and complete occlusion of the L ICA.
Neurology advised to postpone for 3 months to reduce the risk of futher complications given the recent stroke.
After a colonoscopy for his GI bleeding he was started on a heparin drip with a goal PTT maintained between 50 and 70.
He had an episode of BRBPR on [**2-25**] with about 50cc of stool and blood.
He was discharged on aggrenox [**Hospital1 **] given his apparent bleeding complication to full anticoagulation.
GI: He was admitted with a history of GI bleeding but no prior colonoscopy.
The patient was anticoagulated, but then had recurrent GI bleeding (hemodynamically stable), and heparin was stopped.
There were polyps noted on his colonoscopy, and he will require a repeat colonoscopy for purposes of polypectomy in a few months as arranged by his PCP.
His metoprolol was held given his recent episodes of GI bleeding.
Fe studies were consistent with Iron deficiency as well as chronic disease.
Endo: Given his recent stroke and renal insufficency at the OSH, his oral hypoglycemics where held on admission.
Rheumatology: The patient reported a history of gout in his left great toe, and reported similar pain in his left ankle.
The joint was noted to be warm, edematous with marked tenderness to palpation in the absence of trauma or infection.
He was not started on on colchicine for this likely exacerbation of acute gouty arthritis due to his anticoagulation and GI bleeding.
He was also provided a short course of vicodin for pain control.
He was instructed to call his PCP if the left ankle pain should worsen, or if he should develop any fevers or rashes.
Ophtho: He was maintained on his home regiment of Glaucoma medications.
Vicodin 5-500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every six (6) hours as needed for pain for 3 days: Do not drive or operate machinery while taking this medication.
Disp:*8 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: left MCA cortical infarct Bilateral Carotid Stenosis Gastrointestinal Bleeding Acute Gout   Discharge Condition: Stable, right pronator drift.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a stroke and found to have narrow arteries leading to your brain as well as gastrointestinal bleeding.
Your bleeding was stopped with cauterization during colonscopy and you were started on coumadin to prevent further strokes.
Call your doctor or 911 immediately if you have any blood in your stoool, unusually dark or black stools, dizziness, palpitations, sweating, shortness of breath, chest pain, new weakness, difficulty speaking, tingling, numbness or any other concerning symptoms.
You will need a follow up colonscopy in [**5-18**] months (off aggrenox 1 week prior) for removal of polyps noted on your colonoscopy performed here in the hospital.
