Admission Date:  [**2145-8-24**]       Discharge Date:  [**2145-9-29**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  Service:  THORACIC  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59 year-old male with a twenty three year history of smoking, discontinued approximately fifteen years ago who presented with a few months of stabbing and burning sensation over his face, extremities and torso.
Given his symptoms the patient had an extensive workup which revealed a right lower lobe lung mass.
No obvious lymphadenopathy was seen.
The patient was admitted for staging and a possible surgical intervention given no gross involvement of his lymph nodes.
A PET scan was positive for primary disease, but no other involvement was observed.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Alert and oriented and in no acute distress.
HEENT examination no JVD.
No lymphadenopathy palpable.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended without hepatosplenomegaly.
The pathology showed adenocarcinoma that was moderately differentiated with predominantly papillary features and bronchial alveolar pattern.
The frozen section was negative for metastatic disease.
The patient's pain was controlled with the epidural.
On [**2145-8-26**] in the evening the patient was noted to have low oxygen saturation and to be producing copious secretions out of his mouth.
The chest x-ray at the time showed persistent evidence of loculated basal and pneumothorax on the right side and parenchymal density on the right side was suspicious for aspiration.
Bilateral central pulmonary densities were thought to most likely represent pulmonary edema.
The blood gas at the time showed significant respiratory acidosis.
Bronchoscopy was performed, which revealed copious secretions bilaterally and culture of the secretions revealed gram negative rods.
The patient continued to have low grade fevers.
The CAT scan showed no evidence of hemorrhage or stroke at the time.
In addition a PET scan of the abdomen was performed on [**2145-9-2**] to rule out fluid collection.
No fluid collection was seen.
The infectious disease workup did not show any clear source of his fevers given the coverage with antibiotics.
The patient's prolonged respiratory failure was thought to be consistent with ARDS (adult respiratory distress syndrome).
On [**2145-9-7**] the patient complained of right upper quadrant pain and continued to have elevated white blood cell count.
Ultrasound of the gallbladder was performed, which showed no evidence of cholecystitis and showed echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
The patient did have periods of increased agitation and confusion.
He had copious amounts of thick yellow secretions.
On [**2145-9-10**] the patient appeared to have decreasing white blood cell count, decreasing infiltrate on the chest x-ray and no more fever spikes, although he continues to have low grade temperatures.
He continued to bring copious amounts of secretions and continued to be in a rather tenuous respiratory status after being extubated a few days earlier.
