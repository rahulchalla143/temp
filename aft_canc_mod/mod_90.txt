Evaluation included a colonoscopy which showed an ulcerative lesion in the rectum.
These were biopsied and showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.
The patient presents for curative resection.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Prostate cancer with radiation implants and external beam radiation; hypercholesterolemia; history of peptic ulcer disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco; occasional alcohol.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The patient had a #14 French q day catheter placed due to his history of prostate cancer and ureteral stenosis.
There were no intraoperative complications and he was transported to the Recovery Room in stable condition.
Immediately postoperatively, the patient was relatively comfortable with an epidural catheter in place for pain control.
Of note, he began to have a large amount of light brown loose output from his ostomy.
His abdomen became distended and his appetite worsened.
He also had an episode of emesis as well.
KUB revealed a PSBO.
His partial small bowel obstruction was slow to resolve where on postoperative day #18 he was started on clears with continued decompression through his ostomy via the red rubber catheter.
Postoperative day #13, the patient became hypotensive with a severe abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant above his ostomy.
and intravenous contrast was done which showed dilated loops of small bowel and mild edema proximal to the ostomy without free air or contrast extravasation.
There he underwent a VQ scan which was low probability for pulmonary embolus.
On rectal examination, he was found to have an area of anterior separation of his anastomosis and about 30 cc of serosanguinous fluid was drained.
CT scan of the abdomen was repeated which showed, again, thickened bowel but no contrast extravasation.
Of note, as well, the patient's white blood cell count had increased to 24, however, over the next few days, he stabilized with a decreasing white blood cell count, pain abating and better urine output.
During this time, while he was NPO, he was also started on TPN for nutritional support.
He did continue over the next few days to require a few fluid boluses due to his high ileostomy output.
He continued to make slow gains and required two additional CT scans that showed some free fluid in the abdomen which did not show evidence of having extravasated.
The first around the 17th and the 18th with the initial culture growing E-coli and Morganella Morgani and subsequent cultures with no growth.
He had a CT scan of his abdomen which did not show evidence of a leak or any new intra-abdominal fluid collections.
Status post proctocolectomy with coloanal anastomosis and a loop ileostomy.
Partial small bowel obstruction, resolved.
