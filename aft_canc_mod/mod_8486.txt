Admission Date:  [**2135-11-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2135-11-20**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3151**] Chief Complaint: hypotension/ atrial fibrillation with RVR.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] yo female with PMH CHF, PAF, polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], SIADH who presented to ED with decreased po intake.
Per caregiver, no [**Name2 (NI) **], fevers, increased leg swelling, or notable increased SOB.
In ED, CXR showed increased large bilateral pleural effusion.
Head CT was negative for acute process.
Pt with HR up to 150s on telemetry in rapid a fib and SBP dropped to 80s.
Pt given 750 cc NS in ED in boluses for hypotension with no improvement in HR.
Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] 2.
Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation 3.
Macular Degeneration 4.
Hypothyroidism 7.
T11 spinal comprssion.
10. chronic hyponatremia (baseline 125-135)  Social History: SH:  Pt splits her time between [**Location (un) 86**] and [**State 108**].
Family History: M heart problems F heart problems  Physical Exam: Physical Exam on Discharge: Pt deceased in hospital.
No spontaneous respirations.
No cardiac beats.
ED CXR [**2135-11-4**]:There are large bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis and obscuration of the lung bases.
No overt vascular congestion at this time.
The visualized lungs show no focal consolidations.
Large increasing bilateral pleural effusions without overt CHF at this time.
MICU CXR [**2135-11-5**]: Again noted is a small to moderate-sized left pleural effusion, which is not significantly changed since the previous exam.
Again demonstrated are increased interstitial changes bilaterally, most likely related to chronic CHF.
There is aortic atherosclerosis.
Findings consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressures and pleural effusions, the right pleural effusion has slightly improved since the prior exam.
EKG Results [**2135-11-5**]: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and ventricular premature beats.
Poor R wave progresion, probable normal variant.
Inferolateral T wave changes are non-specific.
ECHO [**2135-11-8**] The left and right atrium are markedly dilated.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the  severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence for tamponade physiology.
PHTN was thought to be secondary to longstanding MR. Viagra was was contraindicated because of low blood pressure.
No therapeutic options were available to treat PHTN.
Advised light diuresis to address edema with caustion about reflex tachycardia with more aggresive diuresis.
Advised low salt diet for CHF and  continued fluid restriction to address hyponatremia.
Heart rate was not adquately controled with diltiazem on Friday [**2135-11-10**] the patient and her family elected to have an atrial sinus ablation with a pacemaker placement.
Morphine was given only to make the patient comfortable and was held for respiratory depression.
The patient expired on [**2135-11-19**] on Saturday evening due to advanced congestive heart failure (specificaly pulmonary congestion).
Problems proceeding [**Name2 (NI) 9036**] Measures Only descision desciaion: 1.CHF: Pt grossly total body overloaded, but with recent decreased po intake and dry MM, ?
- patient came in with new b/l pulmonary infiltrates - diuresed with lasix 10IV in ICU and was net approx 1L on transfer to floor today [**2135-11-6**].
(gingerly given relative hypotension in [**Name (NI) **]) - cycle enzymes to r/o ischemia as etiology of CHF exacerbation.
[**11-7**] to [**2135-11-8**] No diuresis.
- It was felt that fluid overload in lungs was probably [**2-9**] rapid rate and poor filling and backup of fluid.
- [**2135-11-7**] 5 AM, pt had an episode of rapid refractory Afib, metoprolol was d/c'd and diltiazem restarted IV then PO 45 mg QID.
Placemant was performed without complication.
- Monitor BP closely.
Hyponatremia, attributed to SIADH, Na 125-135: at baseline - Fluid restriction for hyponatremia 750 mL was continued throughout stay.
Hypertonic saline was never used for fear of CHF exaserbation.
Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **]: - Follow Hct closely.
-Pt is currently untreated for Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] and blood count will continue to rise.
Hematology/Oncology: Was not consulted this admission but on last admission advised holding anticoagulants (coumadin) b/c of bleeding risk secondary to polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].
UTI: Noted on [**2133-11-8**] with UA positive for WBC, bacteria and yeast.
Furosemide 40 mg qod   Discharge Medications: None  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Rapid Atrial fibrillation with hypotension, Congestive Heart Failure.
