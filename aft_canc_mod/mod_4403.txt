Also recent finding of a chest lesion as well.
Due to mass effect and edema and for diagnostic purposes, surgery was recommended and risks and benefits were discussed.
Past Medical History: Type 2 diabetes  Social History: Notable for 1.5 PPD TOB for the past 30+ years   Family History: NC  Physical Exam: On admission: Nonfocal  On discharge: strength full, sensation intact, ambulatory without assistance, incision c/d/i with staples.
periorbital ecchymosis secondary to surgery  Pertinent Results: CT HEAD [**8-22**] 1.
Subtle foci of high attenuation layering along the sulci of the frontal lobes, bilaterally; a small amount of post-operative subarachnoid hemorrhage is not excluded.
There is no large extra-axial hemorrhage.
Expected post-operative changes with resection cavity within the left temporal region and pneumocephalus.
MRI BRAIN [**8-23**] The patient is status post left frontotemporal craniotomy and resection of a previously known rim-enhancing mass lesion in the left temporal lobe.
The expected post-surgical changes are identified consistent with pneumocephalus, residual blood products in the surgical bed, unchanged minimal midline shifting towards the right with approximately 2 mm of deviation.
No new lesions are identified.
Patchy bilateral mucosal thickening is noted in the mastoid air cells bilaterally.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient presented electively on [**8-22**] for resection of left temporal mass via left temporal craniotomy.
He was transported to the ICU post-operatively for observation and his post-op head CT showed minimal blood in the resection cavity.
Post-op MRI showed gross total resection of the mass and his exam was nonfocal with the exception of mild affect change.
