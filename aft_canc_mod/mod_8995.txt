4-cm mass within the right upper lung zone.
Approximately 3.7 x 2.4 cm noncalcified, noncavitating enhancing mass in right upper lobe abutting the right side of the mediastinum, with possible area of assocaited post- obstructive subsegmental atelectasis.
There is no pathologically enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
These findings are concerning for a primary bronchogenic carcinoma that may be accessible to tiisue diagnosis by transbronchial biopsy.
4-mm nonspecific noncalcified subpleural nodule within the right lower lobe.
Second possible smaller nodule in the right lower lobe.
Tiny hypodensity in the right lobe of the liver is too small to characterize.
Brief Hospital Course: 62 yo F c multiple sclerosis, chronic LBP, initially presents with hypercarbic respiratory distress, then intubated, trached and found to have NSCLC.
# Lung cancer - Biopsy of the right upper lobe mass result came back as nonsmall cell lung cancer and it is Stage III by mass size.
She will be followed by oncology as outpatient as necessary for possible palliative treamtment in the future.
# Respiratory failure-Patient initiailly presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration due to multiple sclerosis.
Weaning had been unsuccessful due mostly to muscles weakness from multiple sclerosis.
# Dysphagia/aspiration - Patient has significant aspiration per studies by speech and swallow.
