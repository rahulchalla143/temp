The left lung base is not imaged secondary to overlying cardiac device.
There are no infiltrates, consolidations, or effusions within the imaged lungs.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary disease.
Twelve-mm left apical lung mass, which is stable since [**2134-12-21**].
However, a slow growing metastatic lesion cannot be ruled out.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 6054**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with a history of colon cancer, chronic anemia due to intermittent rectal bleeding, PUD, HTN, and AAA who presented from his nursing home with fever, hypoxia, and hypotension after a blood transfusion.
Initially, given the timeline (2-6 hours after transfusion) and association with fever after blood transfusion, his presentation was thought to be secondary to transfusion related lung injury (TRALI).
This suggested that another process was responsible for his presenting symptoms of fever, hypotension, and respiratory distress.
An infectious source was never determined; however, pneumonia vs. UTI with urosepsis seems most likley.
He was tachypneic, and eventually went into hypoxemic respiratory failure and passed away later that day.
