Admission Date:  [**2178-3-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-4-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2101-12-31**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 16571**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea, hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ICU monitoring  History of Present Illness: 79 yo M with known metastatic nonsmall cell lung CA (mets to T-spine) p/w episodes every 2 hours of coughing up blood starting last night at 2300.
Associated with dyspnea over the past 2 days to the extent that he was unable to get out of bed yesterday.
Also, he had nausea and one episode of post-tussive emesis.
He felt feverish and had chills last night, but did not take his temperature.
He denies chest pain or abdominal pain.
Patient was given Levaquin 750mg IV x1 for CXR showing LLL infiltrate and effusion.
The EKG showed afib with ventricular rate of 113, NA, NI with no STE or changes from previous tracing.
CTA chest negative for PE, but showed tumor burden in L hilum with likely post-obstructive pneumonia in the setting of a left-sided pleural effusion.
On the floor, the patient had no complaints and was speaking in full sentences.
Past Medical History: # stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung dx [**2177-10-21**] by bronchoscopy, MRI [**10-26**] with bony mets to T11, 50-75% narrowing of spinal canal and mild to moderate spinal cord compression.

When compared with the prior radiograph there is interval increase in left basilar opacity compatible with effusion and likely post-obstructive atelectasis or pneumonia.
Increased vague opacity in the left mid lung is also concerning for post- obstructive pneumonia.
Left hilar mass is suboptimally assessed.
IMPRESSION: Post-obstructive pneumonia and atelectasis in the left mid and lower lung with associated effusion.
No pulmonary embolus.
Left hilar mass results in total occlusion of the left upper lobe bronchus and near complete obstruction of the lingular bronchus.
Probable postobstructive atelectasis and pneumonia is present within the left upper lobe with probable lymphangitic carcinomatosis in the left upper lobe.
Increased bilateral pleural effusions.
Tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacification in the right lung and left lower lobe concerning for a small airways disease process including aspiration and/or infection.
Unchanged thrombus in the left superior pulmonary vein.
New T11 pathologic compression fracture with slight retropulsion of the vertebral body into the canal.
------------ Arterial Embolization Report3/11/09: Tumor blush was visualized at the left hilar mass.
The left bronchial artery feeding to the tumor at the left hilum, was embolized with  particles until stagnation of the flow.
CXR [**2178-3-26**]: No pneumothorax.
Left pleural effusion decreased   Brief Hospital Course: This is a 76 year old family who presented from home with hemoptysis.
# Hemoptysis: This was likely secondary to bleeding from patient's lung cancer which is now obstructing his left main bronchus.
He was observed to have continued hemoptysis and required an additional two units of blood.
Patient underwent flexible bronchoscopy on [**2178-3-23**] by interventional pulmonology with APC to active bleeding on tumor site.
Patient's hemoptysis has nearly resolved at time of discharge.
# Hypoxia/Post-Obstructive Pneumonia/Bilateral Pleural Effusions: On admission patient determined to have postobstructive atelectasis and pneumonia on chest CT. PNA initially treated with unasyn and transitioned to levaquin for a total of 10 day course.
In addition patient noted to have bilateral pleural effusions.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient noted to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response to 150's.
# Pancytopenia: Likely secondary to recent treatment with pemetrexed (last dose [**2178-3-12**]).
# Back Pain: Patient has known metastasis to the spine with a particularly symptomatic lesion at T11 which he has received palliative radiation and more recently cyberknife therapy in [**1-23**].
# Type II Diabetes Mellitus: Patient has diet controlled diabetes.
#COPD: Patient had increased wheezing at time of discharge.
He will certainly require pulmonary rehab, pulmonary toilet and incentive spirometry.
His tiotropium bromide was changed to ipratropium bromide and Xopenex was added to his regimen for wheezing/shortness of breath PRN.
We prefer he receive Xopenex rather than albuterol given he has an underlying tachyarrthymia.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Bear [**Doctor Last Name **] Nursing Center - [**Location (un) 2199**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Hemoptysis secondary to left lung mass bleeding, Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, post obstructive pneumonia Secondary: Stage IV non small cell lung cancer, spinal compression fracture at T11 secondary to lung cancer metastases, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type II diabetes mellitus (diet controlled), Hypertension, hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: hemodynamically stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for management of the blood you were coughing up.
We determined that the blood in your lungs represented active bleeding from your lung tumor.
You have also had difficulty urinating which has required foley catheter placement.
If you begin coughing up blood, experience worsening shortness of breath or have fevers or chest pain please contact your primary oncologist or go to the emergency department for evaluation.
