Brief Hospital Course: ===================== BRIEF HOSPITAL SUMMARY ===================== 71M with h/o COPD s/p 2 intubations w/prior exacerbations, diastolic CHF, moderate pulm HTN, cryptogenic/alcoholic cirrhosis c/b portal HTN and varices admitted with presumed COPD exacerbation +/- CHF exacerbation transferred to MICU with respiratory distress and concern for sick sinus.
In the MICU, patient refused intubation and invasive treatment.
======================== ACTIVE ISSUES ======================== # Goals of care: COMFORT CARE Patient was transferred to ICU for respiratory distress early in his hospital course.
Patient made wishes very clear that he wanted to be DNR/DNI and did not want any invasive or heroic treatment.
Patient received boluses of PRN morphine for dyspnea and pain in the ICU.
The patient was extremely tenuous when all invasive measures were removed in the ICU, yet he improved and became interactive while on the medical [**Hospital1 **].
Given his advanced COPD and cirrhosis among other comorbid conditions, his life expectency is certainly <6 months.
Pt with history of COPD with 2 intubations, pulmonary HTN and diastolic CHF p/w cough and dyspnea x3-4D.
Pt with suspected COPD exacerbation aggravated by CHF exacerbation (BNP 5003, previously as high as 13K) in setting of medication non-adherance and high salt load.
CXR with bilateral fluffy infiltrates c/w pulmonary edema.
Less likely PE (negative LENIS, bradycardia); BS bilaterally with no evidence of pneumothorax on CXR.
#?Tachy-Brady Syndrome:   Pt with alternating sinus bradycardia and sinus tachycardia.
On tele, pt found to have HR between 100-150; repeat EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no ST changes, subsequently with HR dropped to 40s with hypotension requiring pressors; pt A&Ox3 with bradycardia, though lethargic.
Otherwise asx, with no focal neuro concerns or chest pain/pressure.
Cardiology consulted and felt no indication for temporary pacer and it was not in line with patient's wishes as above.
