He has had two recent hospitalizations (at B&W Hospital) since starting chemotherapy: one for dehydration, then soon after for acute CHF.
He needed a RBC transfusion ~1wk ago (previously five months ago for chronic AVM GI bleeding).
He was started on levofloxacin for pneumonia the day before admission, but the following day he was having difficulty breathing and coughing and weakness had substantially worsened.
He was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxia and altered mental status and given cefepime, vancomycin, and levofloxacin.
Improved altered mental status.
# Multiple myeloma: Held chemo during infection.
# Anemia: Chronic, but worse.
Haptoglobin <5 and LDH elevated suggesting hemolysis.
Occasional schistocytes reported, acute kidney injury, and altered mental status.
He may have a mild compensated DIC considering elevated coags and normal fibrinogen.
Mixing study cancelled with minimal PTT elevation.
# Acute renal failure: Creatinine 1.1 --> 1.6 --> 1.1.
No additional IV fluids considering high risk for fluid overload with RBC transfusion and CHF (furosemide on hold for low BP, restarted [**2171-10-3**]).
# Abnormal LFTs: Unknown etiology.
Slight elevation of JVP and trace ankle edema.
# CAD: Stable.
# Gastroparesis: Possibly due to diabetes and cause of nausea/vomiting.
# Pain: None.
# DVT PPx: Heparin SC.
# Precautions: None.
# Lines: Peripheral.
# CODE: FULL.

Shortness of breath.
Anemia (low red blood cell count).
Hypotension (low blood pressure).
Hypertension (high blood pressure).
Acute kidney failure.
Abnormal liver function tests.
Congestive heart failure (CHF).
Gastroparesis (slowing of the intestines).
You needed to go to the Intensive Care Unit because of low oxygen levels.
While you were hospitalized, you needed a red blood cell transfusion for anemia (low red blood cell count).
Your blood pressure medications were held because of low blood pressure, but prior to leaving the hospital furosemide (Lasix) and metoprolol were restarted at lower doses.
Metoclopramide (Reglan) was started for gastroparesis (slowing of the intestines), which may cause your occasional nausea and vomiting.
Lastly, your liver function tests were mildly abnormal while here and these should be followed as an outpatient.
Your insulin glargine (Lantus) was decreased because of low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia).
Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers every 6 hours as needed for wheeze or shortness of breath.
