The episodes are not associated with dysarthia or other neurologic symptoms.
She has also had three episodes of peripheral vision changes that last for several minutes at a time.

Please see recent CT chest of [**2143-9-13**] for more complete assessment of these findings.
CT [**2143-9-13**]: New, large (5.2 x 4.7 cm) right hilar lymph node mass causing obstruction of the lateral segment of the right middle lobe bronchus and narrowing of the medial segment of the right middle lobe bronchus, bronchus intermedius and right lower lobe bronchi.
Possible bronchial invasion in bronchus intermedius with irregular, polypoid configuration.
Brief Hospital Course: # Onc/respiratory: Patient has metastatic breast cancer with mass in RUL extending to bronchus intermedius.
Post-procedural bleeding may have lead to further obstruction with clot formation.
Chest XR shows RML infiltrate.
She improved overnight to Room air but still was slightly short of breath (her baseline).
# Dysequilbrium and vision changes: not an acute issue.
Pt will need neurologic workup to rule out TIA including MRI, carotid ultrasounds.
# Cardiac: On ASA as outpatient held at this time and on discharge.
No known cardiac disease.
