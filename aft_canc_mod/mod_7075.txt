He has had rare generalized seizures for the past 13 years.
Overall he reports four events with loss of consciousness, incontinence, and postictal confusion, usually associated with a medical illness or intervention.
Last [**Month (only) **], after two seizures, neuroimaging revealed a left convexity meningioma.
He does not remember his deficits, but medical records indicated right face weakness and aphasia.
Patient has known L frontal lesion that was found in [**2118-8-10**], but has since then had no follow up.
He was seen to have a R facial droop and aphasia.
Patient denies any headache, n/v, dizziness, blurred vision, or dysarthria.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift  Sensation: Intact to light touch Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger  On Discharge [**2119-5-9**]: awakens to voice, oriented x0, expressively aphasic PERRL readily following commands x 4 extremities MAE's with good strengths   Pertinent Results: CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2119-4-27**] 7:54 PM Minimal bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of [**2119-4-28**] 3:24 PM Left frontal extra-axial mass with surrounding vasogenic edema and calcification.
No significantly enlarged external carotid branches are identified although evaluation is limited on the CTA.
The mass does appear to cause mild mass effect without midline shift  ECG Study Date of [**2119-5-4**]  8:43:14 AM  Atrial fibrillation with a mean ventricular rate of 86.
Diffuse non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.

No other intracranial lesions identified.
Left frontal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage adjacent to the resection site is larger than expected in the postoperative setting.
Extra-axial fluid collection overlying the left frontal lobe measures up to 2.2 cm in thickness.
Unchanged mild rightward shift of normally midline structures without evidence of central herniation.
Moderate pneumocephalus is not unexpected postprocedurally.
Post-operative MRI brain with and without contrast [**2119-5-7**] IMPRESSION: Slight increase in hematoma in the left frontal lobe, recommend evaluation with unenhanced head CT. Small foci of acute ischemia/artifact from blood products as detailed above.
MRI at an OSH redemonstrated the known frontal lesion consistent with a meningioma.
Keppra has less interaction with oral anticoagulation.
Surgical intervention was discussed with patient and family for a Left frontal craniotomy for removal of left frontal mass.
The patient was ehibiting some unihibited behavior at times that was attributed to the location of the brain mass.
On [**5-5**], the patient underwent a Left-sided craniotomy for resection of left frontal tumor by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].
expressive aphasia was noted.
There was no pronator drift noted.
The patient was transferred to the Step down unit to continue on telemetry for atrial fibrillation and expressive aphasia.
after transfer to the Step down Unit,the patient was periodically confused and became aggitated at night pulling at dressings and attempting to get out of bed.
Due to intermittent confusion the patient had poor nutrition and IV fluid was initiated Normal Saline at 75cc/hr.
A post operative MRI of the Brain was performed which was consistent with a small foci of acute ischemia versus artifact along the medial and posterior portions of the left frontal lobe.
12. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for post operative pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7665**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Left Frontal Meningioma Delerium   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
If there are any problems or questions please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1669**].
