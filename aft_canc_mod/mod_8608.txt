[**2143-10-31**] Right thoracoscopy and creation of pericardial window.
Drainage of pleural effusion.
She started experiencing progressive dry cough and SOB a few weeks ago and underwent a CT scan of the chest which revealed bilateral pleural effusions in addition to pericardial effusion.
She underwent bilateral thoracentesis and both effusions were positive for malignancy.
Past Medical History: Right radical mastectomy for breast Cancer [**2112**] left simple mastectomy for breast Cancer Paralyzed vocal cord with mediastinal mass [**2135**] Tracheostomy for respiratory compromise secondary to etastatic disease with tracheal compression.

On [**10-31**] she underwent pericardial window for pericardial effusion with right thoroscopy and right pleural effusion drainage.
She was given lopressor 5 mg IV x 2 with drop in SBP to 70s and she was transferred to ICU.
On [**11-4**] she underwent pigtail catheter placement of R pleural effusion.
She received 5 mg IV lopressor x 2 with SBP drop to 70s and transient decrease in HR.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] has no prior history of atrial flutter or fibrillation.
This may have been precipitated by multiple recent invasive pulmonary interventions as well as her recent pericardial window and likely pericardial inflammation.
Cardiology was consulted at the second recurrence of atrial flutter during this hospitalization.
Attempts at rate control with metoprolol have been met by hypotension and little response in rate.
Given her limited life expectancy and apparent symptomatic atrial fibrillation, it was recommended to rhythm control with amiodoarone.
