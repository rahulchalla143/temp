# Hypotension/Sepsis - When the patient was admitted, he had a leukocytosis and was febrile.
It was felt that his likely infectious source was a right lower lobe pneumonia.
His medication choices were limited secondary to his reported allergies.
He was called out of the MICU to the medicine service, where treatment of his RLL aspiration and adrenal insufficiency continued.
He was afebrile on the medicine service and white count trended down to 11 by discharge.
Continued neb treatments and sputum culture on [**7-28**] and showed mod growth for Proteus species, and mod growth for Pseudomonas Aeruginosa which are pan-sensitive.
He has pulmonary follow-up as an outpatient and will likely need repeat films at some point to document resolution of the pneumonia.
# Adrenal Insufficiency - Both the patient and his family stated that he regularly takes 7mg prednisone daily for both his polymyalgia rheumatica and for primary adrenal insufficiency.
On lab testing, he had an equivocal random cortisol level.
# Chest Pain / Troponin Leak - The patient presented with a history of CAD s/p PCI x 2 in [**2159**] and pacer for sick sinus in [**2158**] and revised in [**2163**].
Because he had had some chest pain, it was decided to increase his aspirin dose while he was ruling out.
He did have a slight troponin elevation; however, this was felt to be associated with his acute illness in the setting of chronic kidney disease.
On the day after his admission, the patient was free of chest pain and his EKG's were at his baseline.
On the floor, the patient experienced another episode of substernal chest pain, with radiation to the jaw.
The cardiology consult service did not believe the patient was suffering from unstable angina, and did not recommend any further medical or interventional therapy.
He then developed another episode of chest pain severe, substernal,non-radiating and dull.
The episodes of chest pain seem to be associated with taking clindamycin.
He continued to have chest pain after taking pills or eating spicy or acidic foods.
Obtained Echo records from [**6-26**] which showed EF of 60% with mild dyastolic disfunction.
# Chronic Constipation - The patient was continued on his home bowel regimen with daily Miralx.
