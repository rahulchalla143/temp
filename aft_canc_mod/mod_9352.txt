Blood and urine cultures were sent, which ultimately revealed no growth.
A chest/abdominal/pelvic CT revealed gallbladder distension, fluid collection increased in size at the proximal margin of distal pancreas and in post-splenectomy bed, as well as small plueral effusions.
The patient also received Lasix IV 20mg daily for lower extremity edema with good effect.
Pain was well controlled on Ibuprofen and acetaminophen.
EXTREM: 2+/4+ pitting edema (B) LE.
Diffuse ecchymotic patch (R) LE.
No cyanosis, clubbing.
There remain small bilateral pleural effusions, slightly enlarged compared to the previous examination.
No pneumothorax is present.
There is no axillary, hilar, adenopathy.
There is minimal coronary artery vascular calcification.
In the post-splenectomy bed is a 3.4 x 3.1 cm (4:49) fluid collection with a minimally enhancing peripheral rim.
The fluid collection extends slightly anterior and inferiorly (4:62).
The head, uncinate, and neck of the pancreas appear normal.
There is fat stranding within the abdominal mesentery (4:72, 4:66), which is likely related to post-surgical edema.
The gallbladder is slightly distended measuring 7.7 x 5.5 cm (4:64).
The wall of the gallbladder appears slightly thickened and there is slight fat stranding around the gallbladder.
There is minimal peri-gallbladder fluid (4:61).
Throughout the right and left lobes of the liver are multiple hypodense lesions, compatible with simple cysts.
There is minimal intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.
There are multiple hyperdense cysts arising off both kidneys.
As described previously, the posterior superior wall of the stomach is slightly thickened and inflamed.
The remaining pelvic loops of small and large bowel appear normal without obstruction or dilation.
There is no free air within the abdomen.
The abdominal aorta and its branches appear widely patent.
There are post-surgical changes of the splenic artery (4:58).
CT PELVIS: Colonic diverticula, but no diverticulitis.
Otherwise, pelvic loops of small and large bowel appear normal.
There is no free air.
There is a fat-containing right inguinal hernia.
BONE WINDOWS: There are degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine.
There are no suspicious-appearing sclerotic or lytic lesions.
Cholecystitis cannot be excluded and would recommend right upper quadrant ultrasound if there is focal pain at this site.
The adjacent stomach appears slightly inflamed.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Stable multiple hepatic hypodensities and multiple bilateral renal hyperdense cysts.
Colonic diverticula without diverticulitis.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every [**3-5**] hours as needed for fever or pain.
ProAir HFA 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: [**12-2**] puffs Inhalation four times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Lasix 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: Until edema resolved, and fluid balance even.
Cystic lesion of the left kidney.
Acute on chronic renal failure 5.
Atrial fibrillation 6.
Bilateral aspiration pneumonia 7.
Incision Care:  *Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision site.
*You may shower, and wash surgical incisions with a mild soap and warm water.
