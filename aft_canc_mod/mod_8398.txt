Soft tissue reconstruction with right radial forearm     free flap with subsequently split thickness skin graft.
man who suffered a myocardial infarction in [**2170**] that required him to undergo angioplasty and stent placement and ongoing Coumadin therapy.
He subsequently developed an acute subdural hematoma on the right side that required emergent evacuation and craniectomy that was performed at the [**Hospital1 3372**].
Following adequate clinic stabilization, his cranial bone flap was replaced; however, he subsequently developed a chronic draining wound in his right frontal scalp that has persisted for the subsequent seven years.
During the course of that evaluation, the patient was recommended for a CT scan that showed necrosis of the central portion of the patient's right frontal/temporal bone flap that appears to be associated with full thickness bone loss at the central portion of the flap.
He presented on [**3-26**] for cranioplasty and free flap scalp reconstruction.
Past Medical History: - CAD s/p MI with PCI ([**12/2170**]) - R frontal ICH ([**1-/2171**]) in setting of anticoagulation for MI - AML s/p chemo in [**2156**], in remission - h/o seizures - Anal fissure [**2170**] - OSA - HTN - Hyperlipidemia - H/o 'MRSA infection' in [**12/2170**] - Depression  Social History: no EtOH or Smoking.
Family History: Mother - died at 83 of cirrhosis [**1-18**] surgical complications of [**Name (NI) 10259**] Father - died at 57 secondary to CAD  Physical Exam: Pre-op: AVSS Gen: well appearing, NAD HEENT: obvious depression in the superior frontal region of his scalp with an associated, approximately 1 cm diameter draining sinus tract that is productive of fibrinous material.
There is no surrounding erythema, but there is significant chronic inflammatory tissue surrounding this tract site.
The previously seen craniotomy bone flap has been removed and there is a new mesh in the craniotomy defect.
There is overlying soft tissue air as well as a new scalp flap.
There is heterogeneous high- density material immediately under the mesh, which may represent post-surgical fluid, but if there is concern for infection, this could be further evaluated with MR. Again seen is encephalomalacia of the adjacent right frontal lobe.
There are no intracranial hemorrhages.
Again seen is a dilated CSF space in the left middle cranial fossa, consistent with an arachnoid cyst.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhages.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2177-3-31**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate to severe focal left ventricular hypokinesis with akinesis of the anteroseptum and anterior walls and hypokinesis of the inferoseptum and anterolateral walls (LVEF ?30 %).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.

This was tapered to 10cc/h after 48h and the drain was d/c'd on [**3-31**] without complication.
Blood cultures and CSF cultures had no growth.Zosyn was d/c'd on [**3-28**] following reports from the OR cultures.
This was taken down on [**4-1**] and the wound was dressed with xerform and kerlix and changed daily.
Pain well controlled on oral medication.
Call your physician for fever >101.5, discoloration of the scalp flap, pain, redness, swelling or drainage at the wound sites, or any other symptoms that may concern you.
