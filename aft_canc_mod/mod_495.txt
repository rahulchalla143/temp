A 1.2 x 1 cm hypodense lesion in segment VII appears new since prior exams, concerning for metastatic disease.

Focal renal hypodensities, too small to characterize, likely cysts.

Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan:  62 year old male with metastatic prostate cancer and h/o PE on coumadin now admitted with altered mental status, neutropenic fever and subdural hemorrhage s/p fall.
#Severe sepsis: At the time of admission, the patient had febrile neutropenia, altered mental status, and hypoxia.
On his CT chest, a left lung base consolidation was seen that was consistent with aspiration pneumonia or pneumonia.
The patient's coumadin was held and he received FFP and Vit K with a slow decrease in INR down to 1.5 at time of transfer to the floor.
Per outpt records, the plan was to continue lifelong anticoagulation as his previous pulmonary embolism was thought to be related to his metastatic protate cancer.
# LLL pneumonia noted on CTA with tachypnea: tachypnea resolved on antibiotics.
He remained stable and afebrile and will complete a full course of antibiotic at home.
#Metastatic prostate CA: New CT finding: A 1.4 x 1.5 cm hypodense lesion in the left adrenal gland is new since prior exam highly concerning for a new metastatic focus.
Held home lorazepam due to altered mental status which resolved prior to transfer to the floor.
#febrile neutropenia with septic hemodynamics on presentation: Neutropenia resolved [**2127-8-13**].
Neutropenia resolved.
# Metabolic Encephalopathy: due to fever and neutropenia, now back to baseline per wife and patient.
