Admission Date:  [**2138-5-17**]     Discharge Date:  [**2138-6-1**]  Date of Birth:   [**2062-7-15**]     Sex:  F  Service:  Acove  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer who was originally admitted to [**Hospital3 3834**] [**Hospital3 **] on [**5-3**] with complaints of diarrhea and fevers.
Of note, she had recently completed (in [**2138-3-24**]) a course of Xeloda for right axillary breast cancer recurrence.
On [**5-10**] CT scan was done which showed dilated large and small bowel with thickened colon wall.
She was also started at this time on a course of Vancomycin for empiric coverage of a right middle lobe pneumonia that was seen on that CT scan.
On [**5-14**] the patient started to spike temperatures and had increased somnolence as well as increased diarrhea.
She then became hypotensive requiring pressors.
Culture data from the outside hospital was notable for MRSA in stool and sputum.
Neo-Synephrine was weaned off within 24 hours with aggressive volume resuscitation.
Follow-up abdominal CT on [**5-18**] was consistent with enterocolitis and also showed a right lower lobe pneumonia.
On [**5-30**] a repeat CT showed right lower lobe consolidation and the patient had an increasing white blood cell count.
Vancomycin was restarted at this time for a recurrent MRSA pneumonia.
Cardiovascular:  The patient was noted to have many PVCs and some short runs of MSVT on telemetry in the MICU.
Pulmonary:  The patient was intubated on [**5-17**] for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
She underwent a very slow wean from the ventilator and was eventually extubated on [**5-26**].
Post extubation she had some episodes of desaturation to the 80's which responded easily to suctioning.
GI:  The patient's enterocolitis was presumed to be secondary to Xeloda toxicity (the patient was on a quite high dose).
Following extubation, the patient was noted to have a weak cough and gag reflex and was therefore high aspiration risk.
Heme:  The patient had an elevated INR on admission which corrected with Vitamin K.  During the admission the patient's hematocrit drifted down to 23 and she was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells on [**5-26**].
At the time of transfer she denied any pain, shortness of breath or discomfort.
However, at approximately 11:45 the patient was found in her room with no pulse and no respirations.
