Admission Date:  [**2102-10-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2102-11-7**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**] Chief Complaint: SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 86 y/o Russian speaking male with extensive PMH including metastatic nonsmall cell lung CA s/p lobectomy and XRT, DM, orthostasis, mild diastolic CHF and chronic renal insufficiency presenting with SOB.
Pt has had difficulty breathing for the past several years, especially increasing about 1.5 years ago after segmental resection of a right lung mass.
At that time he also developed increasing pain in his back around the site of his surgery, which increases on inspiration, is present at rest and does not increase with exertion.
He was last discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] for COPD exacerbation [**2102-9-30**].
In general, the patient has not been eating or drinking as much as he used to and has lost weight.
Currently, he describes gradual increase in viscosity of sputum and decreased total volume over the last month.
He feels it difficult to breathe with these secretions.
He continues to have lateral chest pain on deep inspiration.
He denies palpitations, nausea, vomiting, hemoptysis, night sweats, assymetric leg or arm swelling.
In the ED, the patient was treated BiPAP, CXR obtained (interstial infiltrates) and antibiotics given (after sputum was collected).
Metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer - s/p RUL lobectomy [**2100**], radiation tx to pleural based nodule [**12/2101**] 2.
CAD 3.
Type II DM 5.
Chronic Renal Insufficiency 6.
COPD 7.
Depression  Social History: The patient was born in [**Country 532**] and moved to the United States in [**2091**].
He speaks no English.
Dyspnea:  Pt was noted to be producing thick secretions and having difficulty expectorating them.
CXR revealed diffuse interstitial infiltrates and CT revealed an interval increase in the # and size of the pt's innumerable pulmonary nodules, indicating progression of intrapulmonary metastatic disease.
His butamide was increased from 2 to 3mg po qD to aid in decreasing any concurrent pulmonary edema and drying out his secretions.
He needs chest physiotherapy and aggressive pulmonary toilet.
This raised the possibility that some of his radiographic findings were attributable to this infection as opposed to advancing metastatic disease.
After a couple of days, he returned to the medicine floor, where he again had severe respiratory compromise, along with increasing lethargy.
