Admission Date:  [**2177-3-9**]       Discharge Date:  [**2177-3-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2116-1-25**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever of unknown origin.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, obstructive-sleep apnea, and right MCA stroke with result in hemiparesis, who has been in a nursing home environment since a stroke in [**2176-9-10**].
While at the nursing home, the patient had multiple Clostridium difficile infections and urinary tract infection treated with Bactrim and Augmentin.
At [**Hospital 46516**] Hospital, urine culture at that time was positive for E. coli.
The patient had mental status changes with fevers as 105.
Patient was hypotensive requiring Levophed.
The patient was intubated for airway protection at the outside hospital and taken to their Intensive Care Unit, where he was treated with Zosyn, Vancomycin, and Flagyl with a diagnosis of septic shock, Clostridium difficile, and blood cultures subsequently grew out Staph coag negative organisms on [**2177-2-26**] which were thought to come from an indwelling PICC line.
At the outside hospital, this PICC line was subsequently removed, and revealed Staphylococcus aureus.
Chest x-ray revealed bibasilar infiltrates and sputum revealed Staphylococcus aureus [**3-4**] and there was some concern for aspiration given the patient's poor mental status.
The patient had persistent febrile episodes while on antibiotics and workup for tumor fever ensued.
Abdominal and pelvic CT scan revealed bilateral pneumonia, no abscess, 3.5 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm, 1-1.5 cm paratracheal lymph nodes, mild asymmetry of the breast tissue on the right, splenomegaly with small posteroinferior infarct.
Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 55%, no wall motion abnormalities, no vegetations, but was a limited study.
Rheumatoid factor and [**Doctor First Name **] were negative.
Patient remained afebrile on numerous antibiotics for 24 hours prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 1444**].
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for workup of his fever of unknown origin and treatment of his pneumonia, Clostridium difficile colitis, and urinary tract infection.
Right MCA stroke with residual defects.
Prostate cancer status post radical prostatectomy.
Recurrent Clostridium difficile infections x5.
Cervical stenosis.
Atrial fibrillation.
Urinary retention.
Bilateral hearing aids.
Periodontal disease.
Coronary artery disease.
Cardiac examination:  Distant heart sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdominal examination:  Obese, soft, nontender, nondistended, no rebound or guarding, 2 cm palpable mass.
No tenderness.
Extremities:  Right PICC line site, mild erythema, no purulence.
Extremities:  1+ pitting edema to mid tibia.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit service and a workup for fever of unknown origin ensued.
Patient was continued on his aggressive treatment of a Clostridium difficile colitis as well as his urinary tract infection and his aspiration pneumonia with the current antibiotics.
The cause of his persistently high fevers were thought to be most likely infectious, but given the patient's extremely high LDH levels and some lymphadenopathy noted on CT scan at the outside hospital, the possibility of malignancy was also considered and Hematology/Oncology consult was also requested.
Patient subsequently had a whole body CT scan.
CTA of the chest was a limited study due to the patient's habitus, but revealed numerous mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, multiple paratracheal lymph nodes, the largest of which was 1 cm in diameter.
There was also a 1.4 x 1 cm left hilar lymph node as well as a 1.2 x 1 cm right hilar lymph node as well.
There were two large carinal lymph nodes present as well, and there were numerous nonpathologically enlarged bilateral axillary lymph nodes as well.
There were areas of atelectasis within the left lower lobe, and there was no evidence of pulmonary embolus on examination.
CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a splenic infarct, which was known from outside hospital.
No intraabdominal or intrapelvic abscesses were identified and small bilateral pleural effusions were noted.
The interpretation of these findings was difficult given the fact that patient had numerous infectious etiologies and possible malignancy.
Patient's numerous enlarged lymph nodes were thought to be consistent with a reactive process.
The patient's wife deferred mediastinoscopy given the patient's poor prognosis and worsening condition.
Patient also had an abdominal ultrasound performed to check for any lymphangitic involvement of the liver given the patient's mildly elevated LFTs.
Ultrasound revealed an enlarged liver, but no focal masses were seen.
There was no evidence of intra or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.
No pericholecystic fluid was seen, and it was thought to be a relatively benign study.
Patient also had a CT scan of the head performed given the patient's mental status change and given the patient's history of prostate cancer, and right MCA stroke, it was desired to determine that there was no intracranial process that was contributing to his condition.
CT scan revealed only evidence of chronic infarctions involving the right anterior division of the MCA with a small posterior left frontal infarction which were all thought to be old.
There was no mass effect noted.
Patient's condition continued to deteriorate, and patient remained febrile with fevers as high as 103 and 104 despite antibiotics.
Hematologists presented this patient's case at conference, but without tissue biopsy, it was deemed impossible to make a diagnosis of this condition.
Was negative for Legionella.
Patient continued to produce a tremendous amount of copious secretions.
Patient continued to spiral downwards, and despite aggressive treatment of his MRSA bronchitis, Clostridium difficile colitis, and Pseudomonal urinary tract infection, his condition worsened.
Patient went into acute renal failure which was probably secondary to poor hemodynamic function as well as a combination of a diload status post CTA.
The patient became hypotensive transiently and was responsive to normal saline boluses.
Patient became hypotensive on [**3-17**] down to 70/40 with persistent tachycardia into 110s to 120s.
Autopsy revealed numerous necrotic lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum as well as purulent material in bronchi bilaterally.
Microscopic analysis of the patient's lymph nodes and liver revealed anaplastic lymphoma.
