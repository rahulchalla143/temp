Admission Date:  [**2139-3-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2139-3-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-5-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**] Chief Complaint: Found unresponsive Hematemesis Odynophagia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD - esophagogastroduodenoscopy   History of Present Illness: 63 year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse, emphysema, presenting from home with a few days of hemoptysis vs. hematemesis brought in after syncopal episode at home.
He states he was in his usual state of health until two days prior to presentation, when he developed malaise and cough.
This morning he produced bright red blood - it is unclear if this was hemoptysis or hematemesis.
He states he attributes it to sputum because it was small in quality, but does endorse wretching with vomiting (patient somewhat unclear historian regarding this).
His wife states more clearly that he had several wretching and vomiting episodes.
Per patient's wife, patient's best friend died on Saturday and he had a large drinking binge on Saturday.
She thinks he was having a seizure.
No bowel/bladder incontinence.
Continued to have sinus tach throughout stay.

No lymphadenopathy is seen.
There is diffuse thickening of the esophagus, which is more pronounced distally.
No cardiophrenic lymphadenopathy is seen.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
Pleural calcifications are also noted, which is likely related to prior asbestos exposure.
Lung windows are notable for significant paraseptal and centrilobular emphysema.
No definite nodule, mass, or consolidation is seen.
Prominent diaphragmatic calcification along the pleural surfaces with associated scarring is noted.
ABDOMEN: Within segment IV of the liver, there are three discrete liver lesions, the largest of which measures approximately 3.1 x 3.2 cm with peripheral enhancement and central low density concerning for necrosis.
Overall, this appearance is concerning for metastatic lesion.
A second lesion abutting the left portal vein, best seen on series 2C, image 123 measuring approximately 2.4 x 1.3 cm.
A third lesion is seen abutting the liver capsule in segment IVB on series 2B, image 136.
There is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.
There is trace free fluid inferior to the liver edge.
A small hiatal hernia is noted.
The pancreas appears atrophic without focal lesion or ductal dilation.
There is a tiny hypodensity within the right kidney mid-upper pole of series 2B, image 135, too small to accurately characterize.
Bilateral perinephric stranding is nonspecific.
The abdominal aorta and major branch vessels are widely patent with scattered atherosclerotic calcifications noted.
There is artial duplication of the IVC merging at the level of the left renal vein.
There is evidence of prior abdominal surgery with multiple clips noted along the abdominal wall.
PELVIS: Small bowel demonstrates no evidence of ileus or obstruction.
Colonic diverticulosis is noted without evidence of diverticulitis.
Evaluation for colonic neoplasm is limited given the lack of bowel distention.
There is no free fluid in the deep pelvis.
The urinary bladder is moderately distended and appears unremarkable.
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
BONES: No worrisome lytic or sclerotic osseous lesion is seen.
Three discrete liver lesions, with appearance concerning for metastatic disease.
Given the peripheral location, the lesions would be amenable to percutaneous biopsy.
Diffuse thickening along the distal esophagus which in the setting of hematemesis require further evaluation by endoscopy.
Extensive paraseptal and centrilobular emphysema with evidence of asbestos-related disease of the pleura.
Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
No pulmonary embolism.
[**2139-3-3**] CT C-spine w/out contrast FINDINGS: There is diffuse mild degenerative disease of the cervical spine with preservation of normal cervical lordosis.
No fracture or malalignment is noted.
There is no sugnificant neural foraminal narrowing or evidence of central canal encroachment.
The visualized lung apices show severe paraseptal/centrilobular emphysema.
No fracture or malalignment.
Severe paraseptal/centrilobular emphysema, better evaluated on the concurrent CT torso.
EGD [**2139-3-5**] Esophagus:  Mucosa: Severe esophagitis with overlying white exudate extending from approximately 23cm to the GE junction.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Patchy erythema and edema noted in the body and antrum of the stomach.
Impression: Esophagitis (biopsy) Abnormal mucosa in the stomach (biopsy, biopsy) Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: PPI [**Hospital1 **].
Brief Hospital Course: 63M with history of COPD/emphysema on theophylline, asbestos exposure, EtOH abuse, presenting with hematemesis (and not hemoptysis), syncopal episode.
# Hematemesis: By patient and wife's history consistent with hematemesis (not hemoptysis).
Initial concern for gastritis, esophagitis, [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear, or UGI malignancy.
No evidence of portal hypertension to suggest varices.
Endoscopy performed on [**2139-3-5**] demonstrating severe esophagitis and abnormal mucosa in the stomach that were biopsied.
Placed on PPI [**Hospital1 **] and Carafate QID for symptom relief of severe dysphagia.
They will followup with him in clinic and call beforehand if any concerning findings on biopsy results.
# Pancytopenia: Most likely secondary to alcohol abuse and malnutrition, though upon speaking with PCP does not appear to have pancytopenia chronically.
Anemia labs consistent with anemia of chronic disease, reticulocyte count very low at 0.1%  He will need close follow-up with PCP and if no improvement in pancytopenia may need referral to hematology.
# Syncope vs. seizure.
Main differential includes EtOH withdrawal (appropriate timing - 48 hours following last drink) and theophylline toxicity (or perhaps combination of 2) and vagal episode.
No underlying seizure disorder.
No abnormalities on OSH head CT to explain.
No evidence of CNS infection.
Patient had no evidence of alcohol withdrawal on CIWA scale and had no seizure like activity during his stay.
No events on telemetry  # Tachycardia on presentation 140s, corrected to 100 with fluids.
Differential included hypovolemia, bleeding (stable Hct though), alcohol withdrawal, theophylline toxicity, low suspicion PE on presentation with no symptoms.
# Theophylline toxicity.
Tachycardia, hypokalemia and other metabolic abnormalities can be consistent with theophylline toxicity.
His theophylline levels reduced and this medication was not restarted given concern for toxicity.
# Emphysema.
Extensive disease on imaging with reported history of asbestos injury to lungs.
Mild O2 requirement here, though unclear if with normal baseline sats given destructive disease.
Pt did not exhibit withdrawal symptoms during the hospital admission.
Advised that alcohol can exacerbate or cause esophagitis.
# Liver lesions - three discrete lesions, concerning for malignancy/metastatic disease.
Will need liver biopsy but could not be done this admission (IR was not comfortable due to low platelets).
Interventional Radiology will contact patient and arrange with PCP an elective liver lesion biopsy.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing: Use only if needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Disp:*1 inhaler* Refills:*1*  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Severe esophagitis Syncope Liver lesions of unclear etiology, will need follow-up and biopsy Pancytopenia Vitamin B12 deficiency Alcohol abuse Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease / emphysema / asbestos lung injury  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Alert and oriented x3 Ambulatory Status: Ambulatory Able to tolerate liquid and solid oral intake.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for evaluation of vomiting blood and severe pain with swallowing and also being found unresponsive at home.
Endoscopy was performed which revealed severe Esophagitis, which is irritation of the esophagus.
You have been started on two medications (Pantoprazole and Carafate) to treat Esophagitis and to ameliorate the pain associated with it.
CT scan of your abdomen revealed 3 lesions in the liver that we recommend to have biopsied.
Biopsy will be able to evaluate if these lesions are related to benign process or from cancer.
For the unresponsiveness, an EEG was performed to assess for seizures.
You have a Vitamin B12 deficiency that may be contributing to anemia.
You have been taking Theophylline for COPD / emphysema.
We recommend that you work with your primary care physician to arrange for a screen colonoscopy for colon cancer screening.
He knows that you will need a liver biopsy soon and may arrange for some labs (such as blood and platelet count) to see if your platelets have recovered enough for a liver biopsy  Appointment #3 Specialty: Interventional Radiology Date/Time: Expect a call within one week to have an appointment set up.
