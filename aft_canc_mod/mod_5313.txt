Pathological compression fracture is identified at T7 without evidence of significant retropulsion.
Metastatic lesion is noted at the transverse process of T9 on the right and bone marrow infiltration with expansion at the T10 vertebral body on the right, causing right-sided neural foraminal narrowing.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 90 164 72 366/418 76 33 62  ECG [**2151-9-17**]  7:27:36 AM Probable multifocal atrial tachycardia at a rate of approximately 118 with ventricular premature beats and ventricular couplets.
Non-specific anteroseptal repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2151-9-13**] multifocal atrial tachycardia is new and the ventricular rate has increased from approximately 75 to approximatley 115.
Ventricular ectopy persists.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 118 164 80 330/431 70 23 71  ECG [**2151-9-17**]  8:50:02 PM Probable atrial tachycardia with 1:1 conduction and one ventricular premature beat seen.
Poor R wave progression.
Consider prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2151-9-17**] the rhythm appears to be more consistent with an atrial tachycardia rather than multfifocal atrial tachycardia.
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.
Non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2151-9-17**] the cardiac rhythm is now irregular and consistent with atrial fibrillation.
Cardiac silhouette remains within normal limits and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
CXR [**2151-9-21**] FINDINGS: Interpretation of the study is limited due to motion artifacts.
Slight increase of cardiac left opacity, consistent with atelectasis.
The lungs are clear without pleural pathology.
IMPRESSION: There is no acute cardiopulmonary process.
In the recovery room, he had some tachycardia and cardiac enzymes were negative.
On morning of [**9-17**] he had tachycardia with SBP to 80s, found to have new onset a fib - cards consult called and pt was transferred to CCU for closer monitoring  Postoperativelt he was noted to be in afib with rvr refractory to IV lopressor and diltiazem.
He was transferred back to stepdown unit [**9-19**] for tachycardia requiring intermittent lopressor or amiodarone bolus and IVF  On [**9-20**] he had tachycardia to 150's and cardiology was reconsulted.
He had some tachycardia over night when transfering to commode, this improved on [**9-22**].
He had some ptiiting edema in all four extremities which improved when his HCTZ was restarted.
He has no focal motor deficit.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Methocarbamol 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for muscle spasm.
Hydromorphone 2 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q3H (every 3 hours) as needed for back pain.
