[**2162-5-3**] Flexible bronchoscopy   History of Present Illness: 58F with COPD, anxiety and bipolar, transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital with new diagnosis of large central lung mass causing respiratory distress that required emergent intubation.
CXR done in the OSH ER showed (by report only) a very large left mid and lower lobe infiltrate with air fluid level suggesting emypema.
CT chest (report) showed complex, large [**Location (un) 21851**] in mediastinum obliterating L main PA, L main bronchus, and resulting in near complete opacification of mid-to-lower left lung.
She was started on Zosyn and Levaquin  for pneumonia, Solumedrol for COPD flare, and sedation for extreme anxiety.
She then underwent bronchoscopy with FNA on [**4-30**], which showed >75% narrowing of left mainstem bronchus at its most proximal portion and then quickly leading into 100% obliteration secondary to extrinsic compression.
FNA was done, which showed malignant cells, unclear whether nonsmall cell vs. small cell vs. potential mix of pathology.
L vocal cord was also noted to be immobile, suggesting involvement of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve.
On [**5-1**], she developed respiratory distress and became apneic, and had to be emergently intubated during a code blue.
Per the chart, she has >60 pack year smoking history, quit drinking 2 years ago, and has no known exposure history.
COPD - no record of PFT's, no h/o treatments for COPD in past 3.
Hypothyroidism 4.
Chronic anxiety disorder 5.
Bipolar disorder 6.
Anemia  Past surgical history: none   Social History: Social history:  >60 pack year smoking, currently smoking, h/o ETOH dependence, quit 2 yrs ago, currently not working - previously worked doing farm labor.

NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Pending):    ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2162-5-4**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR.
Central left upper lobe mas contiguous with a mediastinal lymph node conglomeration, most consistent with advanced lung cancer.
There is direct contact and mild compression on the aortic arch, encasement and obstruction of the left pulmonary artery, and encasement of the left main stem bronchus with partially obstructing mass distally.
Dominant central cavity in left lung is likely related to necrotizing post- obstructive pneumonia, but cavity component of neoplasm is also possible.
Multifocal bilateral pneumonia.
Multiple left-sided cavities are consistent with necrotizing pneumonia.
Diffuse right peribronchial thickening may be due to either neoplastic infiltration or infection.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2162-5-5**] 4:56 AM In the interim, there is worsening of calcification in the left hemithorax due to combined left pleural effusion and left post-obstructive pneumonitis from a left hilar mass, which is obscuring the left heart border and aortic shadow.
There is also worsened air space disease in the right lung that is attributed either to pulmonary edema and/or pneumonia.
Both diaphragms are partially visualized secondary to bibasilar atelectasis.
Worsening of pneumonia and effusion in the left lung.
Worsening edema and/or pneumonia in the right lung.
Note: Evidence of lymph node sampling is not identified.
[**2162-5-5**] SPECIMEN RECEIVED: [**2162-5-3**]    08-[**Numeric Identifier **]    MEDIASTINAL DIAGNOSIS: Mediastinal mass, fine needle aspirate:    POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS,   consistent with squamous cell carcinoma.
On HD 2, he had a  flexible bronchoscopy was  at the bedside in the intensive care unit through an endotracheal tube.
There was near complete occlusion of the left main-stem bronchus with extrinsic compression was noted.
Purulent sputum was seen emanating from the left main-stem bronchus.
A small amount of purulent secretions seen in the right upper lobe, bronchus intermedius, right middle and lower lobe segmental bronchi, were all suctioned clean.
later on HD 2, she was taken to the OR for a rigid bronchoscopy.
A biopsy of the occlusive airway lesion revealed a non small cell lung cancer.
A CT scan was done which showed central left upper lobe Mass contiguous with a mediastinal lymph node conglomeration, most consistent with advanced lung cancer.
There is direct contact and mild compression on the aortic arch, encasement and obstruction of the left pulmonary artery, and encasement of the left main stem bronchus with partially obstructing mass distally.

Multifocal bilateral pneumonia.

Psych was consulted (see note)recommended continue Seroquel and Haldol prn for agitation.
She tolerated the treatment well but was mildly paranoid.
Lorazepam 2 mg/mL Syringe Sig: Two (2) mg Injection Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
