Since the patient reported no cardiac history nor any chest pain at the time or in the past month, and since the data was not conclusive for an acute MI, and in light of the ARF, the patient was medically managed for CAD with ASA, Statin.
Patient came in from OSH with a Cr of 5.6 despite not reported to have chronic renal insufficiency at baseline.
As CK peaked at 1200, it is unclear if patient could have acute renal failure that patient had rhabdomyolysis.
Two days after admission, patient had an acute decompensation in mental status, becoming very agitated and confused.
Blood cultures were drawn as pt had previously spiked a fever (although he'd been afebrile since), and patient was started on diazepam for EtOH withdrawal.
An echocardiogram on [**2129-6-6**] showed ant-anterolateral akinesis, left apical aneurysm, and an EF of 30%.
The patient's presentation was unclear, but it is likely that pt had an MI sometime in the few days preceding his admission c/w downward trending cardiac markers during his initial hospital course.
In order to assess his cardiac disease, he was thus taken for cardiac cath (unable to schedule P-MIBI), which showed 3 vessel disease with left main disease.
Examination revealed a warm, erythematous, tender L knee.
As pt reported a history of multiple gouty flares and clinical suspicion low for infection, he was started on a 3-day course of colchicine with marked improvement by the following day.
He developed atrial fibrillation that was treated with beta blockers and amiodarone which controlled his rate and he converted to normal sinus rhythm.
He has not been started on an ace inhibitor due to elevated creatinine that is returning to baseline, plan to follow up with PCP for evaluation in 2 weeks.
