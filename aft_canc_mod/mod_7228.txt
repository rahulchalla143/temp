The immediate post op course was complicated by SVT, hypotension, and low urine output and she was found to have an NSTEMI with CK peak 708 on [**5-12**].
Echo on [**5-15**] showed EF 45% with new WMA compared with previous echo: anterior, apical, septal HK.
She was monitored in the SICU until [**5-21**] for rapid afib that was difficult to control as well as CHF.
Today she states that she is doing well with no episodes of SOB or CP.
Will not restart until [**3-26**], [**2197**], as increased risk of bleeding following procedures.

One daughter lives in area  Family History: Positive for CAD, diabetes, negative for inflammatory bowel disease, or colon cancer.
Abd: mild TTP throughout, midline incision, well healing, though inferior aspect of scar is open with packing, with minimal serous drainage, no surrounding erythema, there is an ostomy bag in place.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

eccentric 60-70% stenosis at the origin of D1.
--Successful PTCA of the PLB with a 2.5 mm balloon, PTCA of the mid RCA with a 2.5 mm balloon and PTCA and stenting of the ostial RCA with a 3.0 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent.
Final angiography showed a 30% residual stenosis of the PLB, a 50% residual stenosis of the mid RCA and no residual stenosis of the RCA origin, a type A dissection of the PLB with normal flow in the vessel (see PTCA comments).
CXR [**2197-5-19**]: Previous mediastinal vascular congestion has improved.
Hilar enlargement suggests longstanding elevated pulmonary artery pressure, although heart size is top normal.
Severe gaseous distention of the stomach persists.
[**2197-6-2**]: IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided single-lumen PICC line placement via the right brachial venous approach.
WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2197-6-2**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup is performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from the       site (including a screen for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus       aureus and beta streptococcus).
MODERATE GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2197-6-2**]):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
**FINAL REPORT [**2197-5-31**]**     MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2197-5-31**]):    No MRSA isolated.
**FINAL REPORT [**2197-5-17**]**     R/O VANCOMYCIN RESISTANT ENTEROCOCCUS (Final [**2197-5-17**]):       No VRE isolated.
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2197-5-26**]  8:59:50 AM Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
Right bundle-branch block with left anterior fascicular block.
Diffuse low voltage.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2197-5-23**] no diagnostic interval change.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 83F CAD w/ DES to RCA+RPL in [**2194**], EF 45%, a-fib not anticoagulation for GIB, now with post-op MI and afib s/p colectomy on [**5-10**]  CAD: The immediate post op course was complicated by SVT, hypotension, and low urine output and she was found to have an NSTEMI with CK peak 708 on [**5-12**].
Echo on [**5-15**] showed EF 45% with new WMA compared with previous echo: anterior, apical, septal HK.
She was monitored in the SICU until [**5-21**] for rapid afib that was difficult to control as well as CHF.
She is not on aspirin because of GI intolerance.
Heparin gtt was started as well as Coumadin, however the patient was noted to have several teaspoons of BRBPR as a small puddle on the floor in the bathroom noted by the nurse.
This was assessed as likely [**2-17**] post-operative bleeding from the colectomy and the heparin gtt was stopped.
Did have acute CHF with pulmonary edema in setting of post-op MI and rapid AF.
S/P Colectomy on [**5-10**]: She underwent the operation without immediate complications, though soon afterwards was noted to develop hypotension in the setting of post-op MI as described above.
DM2: Sugars were monitored targeting tight glycemic control, episodes of hyperglycemia with euglycemia achieved with the addition of NPH and tight Regular Insulin sliding scale.
Afebrile without leukocytosis.
GU: Foley replaced secondary to intermittent leakage, urine culture without bacteria, to be removed at rehab when patient ambulating and able to toilet independently.
Lomotil 2.5-0.025 mg PO once a day as needed for diarrhea.
Zofran 4 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every eight (8) hours as needed for nausea for 10 days: While on antibiotics.
