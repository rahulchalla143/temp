# DKA - Upon admission, fit criteria for DKA with anion gap metabolic acidosis, ph<7.3, and positive ketones.
Thought to be secondary to infection (from scalp abscess), and ?non-compliance with meds, but unlikely from ischemia.
Her anion gap had closed although while on the medical floor, she initially had an elevated blood glucose without an anion gap.
