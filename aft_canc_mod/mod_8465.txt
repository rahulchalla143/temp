Per her wife, he was fine until yesterday when she noticed pus around the G-tube.
Per OMR records the patient had a fever to 101.4 the day prior to admission.
He had a recent admission from [**Date range (1) 45889**]/10 for ARF, hyperkalemia, and small bowel versus gastric outlet obstruction.
During this admission a PEG tube was placed for decompression of his stomach and a Port-A-Cath was placed for initiation of TPN.
He then returned to the hospital from [**Date range (1) 102117**]/10 due to abdominal pain and nausea during which his chemo was stopped.
Labs were notable for a WBC of 24 and a mild transaminitis.

He denied pain on presentation and was on his home dilaudid PCA pump.
Currently he only groans to most questions and requests to be left alone so he can sleep.

Left basilar atelectasis and effusion.
New rim enhancing intra-abdominopelvic fluid collection, likely infected.
Enhancing dilated biliary ducts around anterior internal-external biliary drain, concerning for cholangitis.
Segment VIII lesion, which may be an abscess or metastasis.
Foley in the stomach which is markedly thickened suggesting possible gastric cancer growth.
Bilateral effusions and atelectasis much greater on the left.
Right hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated.
There is a small left pleural effusion that is increased compared to prior.
Brief Hospital Course: 40 year-old male with hx of metastatic gastric cancer, s/p multiple abdominal surgeries, and s/p intra-abdominal chemo/XRT who presented to the ED after his G-tube fell out and was admitted with sepsis, likely from intra-abdominal source.
# Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient presented to the ED with frank pus extravastating from his G-tube site and hypotension.
After a goals of care discussion with his wife, he was made DNR/DNI with treatment goals for symptom and sepsis management.
Blood culture from [**2123-9-9**] was positive for lactobacillus.
The most likely source for his fever was felt to be persistent intra-abdominal infection, with limited antibiotic penetrance into abdominal fluid collection.
He was afebrile at the time of discharge, hemodynamically stable, and feeling well.
He was instructed to take acetaminophen as needed for pain/fever, but advised not to take more than 4g of acetaminophen per day.
Metastatic gastric cancer: The patient had been on hospice previously, however per oncology and surgery providers who know him, consistency in goals of care has been difficult.
He will continue to use a dilaudid PCA for pain control, and will receive IVFs through his portacath.
# Anemia: Patient's baseline HCT prior to admission was in mid 20's.
There was no evidence of acute bleeding during his hospital course.
He had some episodes of tachycardia, but otherwise remained hemodynamically stable.
