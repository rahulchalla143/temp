Per the patient's daughter and nurse [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) 2299**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], she had been in her USOH, which included mild stridor since her recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**].
She was given a one-time dose of benadryl, and suddenly dropped her O2 sats to 87% on 6L NC, became unresponsive and "limp".
She was restarted on valsartan on [**9-13**] when her symptoms worsenened.
She was intubated for airway protection and was noted to have a difficult airway.
A head CT, CXR, CT neck and torso were completed and were all grossly wnl, except for a non-perfusing left vertebral artery.
She was given 1g of CTX, 1g of vancomycin, and 500mg of metronidazole despite not having fevers, leukocytosis or any focal signs of infection.
She was noted to have coffee ground emesis through her OG tube, with guiac negative stools, and was given 40mg of IV pantoprazole.

No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Persistent, partial opacification of the mastoid air cells.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
Interval worsening of right lower lobe consolidation and pleural effusions.
Paranasal sinus disease better evaluated on the recent head CT. 6.
Chronic right internal jugular occlusion with extensive thoracic collaterals.
Pansinusitis with evidence of acute-on-chronic inflammatory change; the findings appear most marked involving the sphenoid sinuses and their lateralrecesses, bilaterally.
There is no evident involvement of the intracranial or intraorbital compartments.
Very poor dentition as described, with findings strongly suggestive of periapical abscess involving a left maxillary molar and, perhaps, right maxillary incisor with evident cortical breakthrough.
Opacified mastoids, bilaterally, with fluid in the right middle ear cavity, which may relate to the combination of prolonged intubation and supine positioning; however, an inflammatory component cannot be excluded.
Moderate right pleural effusion.
Trends: WBC: 6.6-> 7.8 HCT: 32->29 Discharge Chem panel: [**2173-9-27**] 08:45AM BLOOD ESR-85* [**2173-9-27**] 08:45AM BLOOD Glucose-263* UreaN-34* Creat-5.6*# Na-134 K-4.2 Cl-95* HCO3-24 AnGap-19  Brief Hospital Course: 1)Respiratory distress: The patient has a history of subglottic laryngeal edema of unclear etiology, and likely causes included angioedema from ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] vs. history of multiple intubations.
This episode occured temporally after being restarted on Valsartan so angioedema was on the differential but given history of multiple recent intubations, laryngeal edema was thought to be the most likely etiology.
CTA chest  was negative for PE or any other acute process.
There was no further respiratory distress noted during her hospital course.
pneumonia although no culture data or CXR data to clearly support this.
- trach collar care to be continued at rehab - Can use PM valve as tolerated to assist with speech - followup with pulmonary to assess trach and eval for any edema .
2)Fevers/leukocystosis: A few days into admission, the patient started spiking temperatures with a mildly elevated WBC.
There was concern for line infection given R femoral line that was placed in the emergency room.
Several days later, the pt spiked again and was noted to develop loose stools.
Patient had a CT scan of the sinuses which showed extensive sinusitis as well as possible dental abscesses.
She was taken to the OR on [**2173-9-26**] and 10 teeth were extracted; a small tongue nodule was also biopsied.
3)Hypertensive urgency: Patient initially presented with elevated blood pressures in the emergency room.
4)Coffee ground emesis: Patient presented with coffee ground emesis on admission which quickly resolved.
The pt has  prior history of gastritis resulting in an UGIB, however no further intervention was persued on this admission.
The pt is known to have thrombosis around the distal portion of her HD line, for which renal has currently elected not to treat.
- discuss with outpt nephrologist regarding indication for anticoagulation for thrombosis.
Nurses noted high residuals so she was started on standing Reglan with mild improvement.
10) Psych/neuro: Pt's home meds of celexa, namenda, and risperdal were not continued while in the ICU given use of other sedating meds.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] does become slightly delirious on occasion at nights and even needed restraints at one point.
Has HD line for dialysis .
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Laryngeal Edema causing acute respiratory failure Dental infection now s/p extraction Thrombosis of HD line - plan to hold on anticoagulation for now Hypertension: s/p new medication regimen Possible [**Last Name (un) **] and ACEi allergies  Secondary: ESRD on HD qTues, Thurs, Sat Type II Diabetes mellitus Vascular dementia s/p CVA Osteoarthritis   Discharge Condition: Stable, satting well on trach collar, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because of unresponsiveness and difficulty breathing.
We think this is likely due to a combination of swelling in your airway from previous times when you had a breathing tube as well as possible medication side effect of swelling from one of your diuretics.
You had some fevers and were put on several antibiotics.
We think the cause of the fevers was most likely a dental infection, and the oral surgeons did an operation to remove some diseased teeth which may have been causing you to have these fevers.
Please call your PCP if you have any difficulty breathing, notice your neck is swelling up, have any mouth or tooth pain, or have high fevers/chills or other symptoms which are concerning to you.
Followup Instructions: Please follow up with your PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 1 week; please f/u results of tongue nodule biopsy with your PCP at this appointment  Please follow up with Drs.
