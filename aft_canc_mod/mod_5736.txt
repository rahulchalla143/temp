Admission Date:  [**2113-7-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2113-8-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2037-3-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: UROLOGY  Allergies: Ciprofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6440**] Chief Complaint:  76M with a complicated course of a prostate infection, prostetic fistula, intraabdominal sepsis, and malnutrition presented with Fever, confusion, and malaise.
Chronic prostatitis/recurrent prostate abscesses since [**3-11**].
Pt has undergone at least 2 percutaneous drainages of periprostatic phlegmons since [**3-11**] and has been treated with long-term antibiotics, most recently with bactrim since [**5-11**].
Pt reports a fever since Friday [**7-14**] with a Tmax of 101.8 this morning.
Past Medical History: Prostate cancer, hairy cell leukemia, mitral valve prolapse, glaucoma, depression, hypercholesterolemia  PSHx: Splenectomy ([**2103**])  Social History: rehab since [**2113-7-8**]  Family History: Non-Contributory  Physical Exam: Physical Exam Gen: Well appearing, no acute distress CV: Regular rate and rhythm, no R/G/M RESP: CTAB ABD: Penrose drain to gravity in ostomy bag, Soft, non-tender GU: Foley to gravity   Pertinent Results: Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2113-7-17**] Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild mitral leaflet thickening but without definite vegetation or pathologic flow.
Limited evaluation of the pelvis secondary to motion artifact and the patient's inability to tolerate the examination.
Right ischiorectal fossa abscess adjacent to the right prostate gland.
Ill-defined fluid collection within the dorsum of the penis, which may represent a second abscess versus non-specific edema secondary to Foley catheter.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes.
No previous tracing available for comparison.

Two lower thoracic vertebral bodies are mildly compressed anteriorly.
resdiual fluid, No Abscess SBO, distended loops of SB, adhesion along anterior abd wall  ([**7-27**]) CXR-PICC in place, not PTX, able to visualize left diaphragm better compared to CXR on [**7-25**], improvement of aspiration pneumaonia [**7-25**] CXR pos for aspiration pneumonia-  New left lower lobe consolidation consistent with aspiration and/or atelectasis.
[**7-31**]-Penile Wound Culture - positive for Coag negative Staph Aureus and Vancomycin sensitive Enterrococcus Negative for AFB, Fungus, HSV 1&2,  [**7-31**]-I&D in OR PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Scrotal abscess.
PROCEDURE:  Incision and drainage, wash-out of scrotal abscess.
The penial wound is cleaner with less yellow fibrinous tissue in the wound.
There is a thick black necrotic rim of tissue just below the Glan.
Suggestions for care: Penal wound cleanse with commercial wound cleanser spray and pat dry.
If wound gets dry slightly moisten the Aquacel Ag with saline just over the wound to release the silver ions, change daily and prn.
[**8-5**]:CT Head:No intracranial  hemorrhage or mass effect.
[**8-8**] CXR: Decreased left lower lobe opacity/atelectasis with no new infiltrates identified  [**7-31**] Pathology:1)Skin, scrotum (A): Ulceration, dermal necrosis and diffuse acute and chronic inflammation consistent with abscess.
Skin, penile shaft (B): Ulceration, dermal necrosis and diffuse acute and chronic inflammation consistent with abscess.
The changes may be secondary to radiation effect, however, the extensive inflammation is suggestive of an infectious component.
Gram stain is negative for bacteria.
Definitive identification is not possible, however, while some of the structures are irregularly shaped (possible debris), there are some well formed structures which raise consideration of fungus (possibly degenerated).
Culture is more sensitive means to detect organisms than histologic special stains.
A negative preliminary result does not exclude a fungal infection, as fungi may take weeks to grow.
[**7-30**] CT ABD/Pelvis IMPRESSION: 1.Slight increase in amount of anterior scrotal fluid collection just inferior to known open wound defect and adjacent to the right testicle.
Overall amount of fluid within the scrotal sac has diminished since prior examination.
Stable extensive penile edema and a small ischiorectal simple fluid collection without CT evidence to suggest underlying abscess.
2.Improvement to small bowel dilatation.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted to Urology service on [**2113-7-16**] with 3 days of fevers and a history of chronic prostate infections/abscesses s/p brachytherapy on [**11-10**] which was surgically drained on [**2113-7-7**] with a penrose drain left in place draining urine to an ostomy bag as well as a foley catheter.
An MRI done on [**7-17**] showed a right ischiorectal fossa abscess adjacent to the right prostate gland which was successfully drained on the same day under CT guidance and a pigtail drain was left in place.
The pts WBC declined from 31.7 on admission to 23.0 on [**7-19**] and the pt remained afebrile during that interval.
On HD#5 ([**7-20**]) the patient underwent a cystectomy and prostatectomy  and an ilial conduit urinary diversion.
The patient also showed evidence of a quiet delerium, most likely [**1-6**] post-op, ICU, and/or infection.
#Hem/ID: Leukocytosis: likely secondary to GU source.
No evidence of other infectious source.
Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Hospital1 **] Oncologist)was [**Hospital1 4221**] on [**7-27**]:  Patient is s/p splenectomy and therefore will have elevated WBC chronically.
There is almost no chance that his leukemia could be implicit in his poor wound healing.
He was placed on Broad Spectrum IV antibiotics including Meropenem, Daptomycin, and Zosyn for his worsening wounds while awaiting culture and sensitivities.
On [**7-25**] wound cultures demonstrated 1)Coag Neg Staph and 2)Vanc sensitive Enterococcus.
The Daptomycin was switched to Vancomycin on [**8-8**] due to rising creatinine and possible acute tubular necrosis from daptomycin use.
# CV: No h/o coronary disease.
TTE showed no evidence of vegetations and has preserved EF.
statin  # Pulmonary-Mr [**Known lastname **] had an episode of Aspiration Pneumonia on [**7-25**].
#GI: Patient was on TPN for several weeks in order to improve his nutrition(pre-albumin of 7) and wound healing.
No aspiration was seen and he was able to start PO's for Pleasure, and keep TPN for primary nutrition.
The first wound a midline abdominal wound was due to failure of closure after surgical incision.
The Penile wound gradually increased in size from [**Date range (1) 57820**].
It grew 1)Coag Neg Staph and 2)Vanc sensitive Enterococcus.
Both wounds were packed three times daily using Accuzyme and curlex AMD rolls, which aided in wound debridement and promoted growth of healthy tissue.
Plastic Surgery was also [**Month/Year (2) 4221**] regarding the penile wound, for possibility of placing a wound VAC.
However, as the surrounding tissue became less friable and more pink Plastics was [**Month/Year (2) 4221**] again for a wound VAC.
Patient had a UTI on [**8-1**] which was positive for funguria.
On [**8-8**] His Creatinine was 1.3, possibly due to Accute Tubular Necrosis from the nephrotoxic Daptomycin.
However, Mr [**Known lastname **] never had any focal neurological symptoms throughout his hospital stay.
# Psych:Depression, continued effexor, was tapered off starting [**8-9**] due to rising Creatinine.
#HEENT:On [**7-28**] Mr [**Known lastname **] had hoarseness for three days, therefore an ENT consult was also obtained to rule out vocal cord paralysis.
His scope was negative for vocal cord paralysis.
