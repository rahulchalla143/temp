Admission Date:  [**2199-4-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-4-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2130-8-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**] Chief Complaint: cardiogenic shock  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IJ central line placement  History of Present Illness: 68-year-old male with history of atrial fibrillation, severe pulmonary hypertension, systolic and diastolic heart failure (EF 20%), COPD, CKD, metastatic prostate cancer s/p obstructive uropathy with bilateral nephrostomy tubes who is transferred from an outside hospital for cardiogenic shock.
Per report, he was in his usual state of health until several weeks ago when he developed slowly increasing difficult of breathing, increasing weight and lower extremity edema.
After this intervention he had continued worsening with breathing and presented to an emergency department on [**2199-4-11**].
He denies palpitations, chest pain or dizziness although noted PND and orthopnea.
CXR was consistent with heart failure with NT-proBNP was elevated at >28,000 (previous hospitalization of 11,000).
He was though to be in acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure and acute on chronic kidney insufficiency and was given IV lasix.
Cardiology was consulted and saw the patient and recommended transfer to the ICU as the patient had increased tachypnea and a HR of 100-120s.
She found it difficult to determine his volume status but ultimately thinks he is fluid overloaded due to increased weight and history.
He notes some nausea, vomiting and diarrhea which is worse over the last couple of days.
He denies chest pain.
His shortness of breath is mostly exertional at this point.
He denies recent syncope or presyncope.
He endorses ankle edema and recent weight gain of 6 pounds.

Sclera anicteric.
OP without lesions.
CARDIAC: Irregularly irregular, soft, S1, S2, not able to appreciate any murmurs or gallops.
No CVA tenderness, no RUQ tenderness, no suprapubic tenderness.
EXTREMITIES: Cool extremities, 1+ edema at ankles.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Diminished DP and radial bilaterally.
CXR [**4-12**]: There is a prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings consistent with fluid overload.
There are bilateral pleural effusions and left retrocardiac opacity.
There are no pneumothoraces.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
Mild to moderate ([**11-19**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2199-3-5**], no clear change.
There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.
There is no evidence of acute cholecystitis.
There is no ascites.
COLOR FLOW AND DOPPLER ANALYSIS:  Hepatic veins are enlarged but display normal waveforms, which may be secondary to heart failure.
Labs on discharge: expired  Brief Hospital Course: 68-year-old male with history of atrial fibrillation, severe pulmonary hypertension, systolic and diastolic heart failure (EF 20%), COPD, CKD, metastatic prostate cancer s/p obstructive uropathy with bilateral nephrostomy tubes who was transferred from an outside hospital likely in mixed picture of septic shock and cardiogenic shock with DIC and metabolic acidosis with worsening markers of perfusion and multi-organ failure despite all appropriate interventions.
# Cardiogenic shock: Patient presented with some features of cardiogenic shock on mixed picture as above.
Patient with cool extremities and poor CI on admission (CI was 1.x).
Swam ganz placed overnight for monitoring.
Started on pressors on [**4-13**] AM due to HR in 20s and worsening mental status.
Pt has both systolic and diastolic heart failure.
He was diuresed on admission due to suspicion for CHF exacerbation but after going this route it became apparent that pt was volume depleted.
He was given fluids overnight with no real change in status.
# Urosepsis/septic shock with GU source: Patient initially thought to be in cardiogenic shock but later appeared to be a mixed picture and clearly had a septic component.
Pt had uptrending lactate as above and downtrending mixed venous O2.
Pt also had a white count which was been trending up overnight.
# Multiorgan failure: Pt had acute on chronic renal failure and hepatic failure despite best efforts at treating shock.
He was in progressively worsening metabolic acidosis [**12-20**] lactic acidosis in the setting of cardiogenic and septic shock.
Additionally, elevated FDP, elevated d-dimer, rising INR, dropping platelets, and dropping fibrinogen are c/w DIC.
