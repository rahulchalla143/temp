HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84-year-old male who presented for outpatient ERCP and was found to have a newly diminished hematocrit to 17 and newly increased INR to 3.0.
The patient had recently been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus three months ago and started on insulin.
Approximately 3 1/2 weeks ago, the patient developed dark urine and went to his primary care physician who noted jaundice and had the patient go for a CT of the abdomen where a mass in the head of the pancreas was seen.
Upon presentation, he noted melenic dark black stools mixed with some [**Male First Name (un) 1658**]-colored stools, fatigue, back pain, early satiety and some decreased appetite.
The patient was evaluated and concern for pancreatic carcinoma led to scheduling for an ERCP.
There was also concern for a possible biliary obstruction given the elevated alkaline phosphatase of 1,818 and total bilirubin of 12.4 and so the procedure was also for the purpose of decompression.
On the day after admission, the patient had received 2 units of packed red blood cells and had a CT of the abdomen which revealed a 3.2 cm mass in the head of the pancreas with clear fat planes between the mass and all surrounding abdominal organs with vascular structures intact with the exception of the mass which abutted and possibly invaded the duodenum.
There was massive intra and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and pancreatic ductal dilatation upstream to the pancreatic head mass.
Incidental finding of a small left renal cyst versus angiomyolipoma was noted.
The patient had episodic desaturations to the low 70s to 80s which improved to 90s with supplemental oxygen.
Chest x-ray done at one of the episodes revealed diffuse interstitial opacities, raising a question of pulmonary edema versus lymphangitic spread versus atelectasis with collapse versus pneumonia.
There was concern for evolving sepsis in the setting of biliary obstruction and possible cholangitis.
The patient was electively transferred to the ICU and evaluated for emergent biliary decompression.
The patient's hematocrit was noted to continue to be low and he was given 3 units of packed red blood cells along with vitamin K 10 mg subcutaneously for an elevated INR.
The patient's hypoxia was thought to be secondary to multilobar pneumonia versus evolving ARDS.
The patient's acute renal failure was thought secondary to possible prerenal state in the setting of sepsis.
Renal was consulted for further evaluation of the patient's acute renal failure and it was felt that the patient's acute renal failure was secondary to acute interstitial nephritis in the setting of treatment with Zosyn.
At 7:35 p.m. on [**2178-5-10**], the patient was intubated for progressive hypoxemia.
The patient underwent emergent ERCP which showed a giant ulcer in the posterior vault, evidence of previous cholecystectomy, biliary stricture compatible with known tumor in the head of the pancreas.
There was concern for malignant ulcer in the posterior duodenal bulb, distal common bile duct stricture consistent with the known tumor in the head of the pancreas.
The patient was followed by Renal who recommended the use of diuretics for volume control.
Cortisol levels revealed that the patient did not have any evidence of adrenal insufficiency.
The patient was bronchoscoped for evaluation of pneumonia versus ARDS.
The option of dialysis was presented and the family elected not to partake of this.
The patient was ventilated with low tidal volumes and increased respiratory rate per the ARDS net protocol.
An esophageal balloon was used to guide the patient's PEEP requirement and this suggested ARDS as the patient had increased chest wall and abdominal pressures.
The patient's ICU course was also complicated by hyponatremia which warranted increased free water boluses.
By [**2178-5-23**], the patient showed improvement in his ventilatory requirements as well as ability to come off pressor agents.
His acute renal failure continued to improve.
The patient developed some neutropenia which was also felt to be due to a reaction of Zosyn.
Also, in support of a reaction to Zosyn, the patient developed a maculopapular rash.
The patient had been afebrile for a significant amount of his ICU stay and around [**2178-5-21**], developed low-grade temperature elevation and cultures were drawn.
The patient eventually grew MRSA from sputum, likely related to ventilator-associated pneumonia.
Given the possible presence of a drug reaction and some decreased urine output and difficulty controlling the patient's volume, the patient was diuresed with ethacrynic acid with good response.
The patient developed hematuria for which Urology consult was obtained and this was thought to be secondary to ethacrynic acid which is associated with gross hematuria and the patient was diuresed further with Lasix in place of ethacrynic acid.
The patient developed a contraction alkalosis for which he received Diamox with a good improvement.
He continued treatment for MRSA pneumonia with vancomycin for a total course of ten days.
His acute renal failure resolved to a baseline creatinine of 1.4.
He developed oral lesions shortly after extubation which were thought to be secondary to HSV.
The patient remained with tenuous respiratory status over the next four days after extubation but did show slow but steady improvement in his oxygen requirement.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus times 22 years.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a sister with diabetes and chronic renal insufficiency.
There is no history of pancreatic malignancy in his family.
CT of the abdomen revealed a 3.2 cm mass in the head of the pancreas, clear fat planes between the mass and all surrounding abdominal organs and vascular structures with the exception of the duodenum.
Massive intra and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation was noted, pancreatic ductal dilatation upstream of the pancreatic mass was noted.
Small left renal cyst versus angiomyolipoma was noted.
Chest x-ray revealed biapical pleural thickening, small bilateral pleural effusion.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was an 84-year-old male with a pancreatic mass status post ERCP and stenting for biliary obstruction with a complicated ICU course significant for respiratory failure and acute renal failure.
PULMONARY:  The patient underwent extubation on [**2178-6-4**] and had ongoing difficulties with secretions and aspiration.
He underwent several bedside swallow evaluations which initially showed severe aspiration but with time he was able to pass a bedside swallow examination.
ENT evaluated his vocal cords for vocal cord dysfunction and he appeared to be able to protect his airway.
He completed a ten day course of vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia.
He continued to have aggressive pulmonary toilet and continued to do well from a respiratory standpoint.
RENAL:  The patient's acute renal failure resolved completely to be better than baseline, creatinine of 1.4.
The patient's acute interstitial nephritis was thought to be secondary to Zosyn.
NEUROLOGIC:  The patient initially had depressed mental status which was thought secondary to the heavy sedation while intubated.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient did undergo an echocardiogram which revealed LV ejection fraction of 70%, mild diastolic dysfunction, no regional wall motion abnormalities, normal right ventricular systolic function, mild 1+ mitral regurgitation, moderate pulmonary hypertension, moderate 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, and no evidence of pericardial effusion.
The patient had some hypertension after extubation and was initially started on Lopressor.
His Lopressor dose was limited by bradycardia while asleep at night and thus his Losartan was reinitiated after his renal function improved.
The patient did have one run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia while in the ICU limited to three beats.
Given his normal ejection fraction and no evidence of coronary artery disease on echocardiogram, this was observed with telemetry.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient was maintained on a regular insulin sliding scale and fingerstick blood sugar monitoring for his diabetes mellitus.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was with a pancreatic mass concerning for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Surgery was reconsulted after the patient was extubated but continued to feel that the patient was too deconditioned to undergo such a significant abdominal surgery.
Discussion was held with the patient and his family including his son, [**Name (NI) **], and wife and he elected not to consider surgery for his pancreatic malignancy.
They felt that it was possible that the patient had gastric outlet obstruction secondary to a malignant ulcer versus extrinsic compression from a pancreatic mass.
If the patient is not able to nourish himself orally, a permanent enteric feeding tube would need to be considered versus chronic total parenteral nutrition.
If PEG or PEG J tube were to be considered, the patient may need to undergo upper GI series and esophagram to evaluate the anatomy for possible placement of one of these tubes.
Multiple attempts were made to pass a NG tube in the postpyloric position and were met with difficulty suggesting the possibility of the pancreatic mass limiting the ability to achieve a postpyloric tube even through interventional radiology.
The patient also had his course complicated by hypernatremia which was treated with free water boluses initially and then IV D5W.
Pancreatic mass concerning for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Biliary obstruction secondary to pancreatic mass.
Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome.
Acute renal failure secondary to acute interstitial nephritis from Zosyn.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
Toxic metabolic encephalopathy now resolved.
Giant ulcer in the posterior bulb of the duodenum.
