Urgent aortic valve replacement with a 25-mm Biocor Epic tissue valve.
Mitral valve repair with a triangular resection of middle scallop of the posterior leaflet P2 and a mitral valve annuloplasty with a 30 mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] annuloplasty band.
viral prodrome.
During the days up to admission, he also developed DOE and had progressively more difficulty climbing stairs, requiring rest, which was a change in baseline.
In hindsight, he actually reports progressive dyspnea while walking for the past several months (4-6 months), when he was evaluated for LE claudication.
Functionally, he feels he can no longer walk 1 block or do 1 flight of stairs due to his breathing.
He also reported weakness and fatigue.
On ROS, he reported cough for 3-4 days without fever or sputum.
He denied abdominal pain or headache.
X-ray confirmed acute CHF exacerbation with ?
He was also in rapid AF with ?
rate related ST depressions, requiring lopressor.
On saturday, he again went into rapid AF, and developed chest pressure with acute CHF exacerbation.
Echo there showed critical AS with valve area 0.4 cm2, and he is transferred for consideration of aortic valve intervention.
Of note, cardiac enzymes were notable for negative troponin x 2 and BNP 268 then 560. .
Per review of [**Hospital3 417**] admission note, suspicion was for congestive heart failure possibly triggered by early pneumonia.
He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Notable for absence of palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+  Pertinent Results: ECHO [**2159-3-6**] The right atrium is moderately dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post bypass The patient is s/p Mitral valve repair with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 30 ring and an 25 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 923**] bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement The patient is on an Norepinephrine drip at 0.05 mcg/kg/min and a milrinone drip at 0.5 mcg/kg/min The cardiac index is 2.9 The mitral ring is well seated with no peri/paravalvular leaks seen.The mean gradient across the mitral valve is 3 mmhg The aortic valve is well seated with no peri/paravalvular leaks.The mean gradient across the aortic valve is 11 mm hg There is persistent moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation The aorta is intact post decannulation LV function is preserved at an EF of>55%  Cardiac Catheterization [**2159-2-27**] 1.
The LAD had diffuse mild plaquing with sever fal disease in the mid diagonal branch.
The Lcx had a sever proximal lesion with focal stenosis and diffuse mild to moderate  stenosis distally.
The RCA was mildly ectatic with diffuse mild  plaquing and TIMI 2 flow.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated left sided filling  pressures with a mean PCWP of 28mm Hg.
The was moderate to severe pulmonary pressure with a PASP of 58mm Hg and an elevate PVR.
The was low normal systemic systolic pressure of 90mm HG with severely depressed cardiac index of 1.8 l/min/m2.
Bilateral pulmonary edema appears slightly increased compared to the prior examination.
Resolution of multifocal consolidative nodules.
Severe aortic valve calcification and atherosclerosis of the coronary vessels.
Upper and lower pole left renal cysts.
He initially presented on [**2159-2-24**] to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital with progressive dyspnea and acute congestive heart failure exacerbation, and was thus transferred for consideration of aortic valve intervention given concern for critical/severe aortic stenosis.
He was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner which included a carotid duplex ultrasound which shoed less then 40% stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid arteries.
A cardiac catheterization was performed which showed single vessel coronary artery disease.
A chest CT scan was performed which showed a stable dilatation of the ascending thoracic aorta measuring up to 4.7 cm in diameter and likely pneumonina.
Multifocal consolidative nodules were also noted predominantly right upper lobe.
As there was some concern that these lesions could also represent bronchogenic carcinoma, a repeat CT scan was done.
Heparin was continued for his atrial fibrillation.
No evidence of infection was identified on exam or by panorex and he was cleared for surgery from an oral standpoint.
A mild acidosis was allowed to recover.
Mr. [**Known lastname 3075**] was noted to have some difficulty swallowing.
A speech and swallow consult was obtained which showed evidence of aspiration with thin liquids.
Coumadin was resumed for his chronic atrial fibrillation.
The patient developed ecchymosis at the vein harvest site of the right lower extremity.
He remained afebrile with a normal WBC count.
A copious amount of dark blood and clot was milked from the vein harvest site on POD 6.
By the time of discharge on POD 7 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
