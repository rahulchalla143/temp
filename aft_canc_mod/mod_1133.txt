Total colectomy: A.  Diverticular disease with multifocal diverticulitis and peri diverticulitis, rupture, and recent hemorrhage.
B.  Focal superficial ischemic type mucosal injury.
C.  Focal mucosal crypt abscesses and distorted architecture, likely related to diverticular disease.
D.  Appendix with focal mild mucosal acute inflammation and recent hemorrhage.
Imaging: Adm EKG: Supraventricular tachycardia with 2:1 block.
Clinical correlation is suggested  [**8-5**] GI Bleed study: No evidence of GI bleed.
[**8-9**] TTE: Symmetric LVH with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function and high cardiac output  [**8-9**] GI Bleed study: No evidence of bleeding  [**8-9**] CXR: Lateral aspect of the right lower chest is excluded from the examination.
[**8-10**] CTA: Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
No acute pathology identified.
No evidence of active extravasation, perfusional abnormality, or pseudoaneurysm identified.
[**8-10**] IR procedure: Subselective mesenteric angiography demonstrating active extravasation at the hepatic flexure.
Embolization performed with one coil to the supplying branch of the right colic artery and two coils to a branch of the middle colic artery.
Compared to prior study [**8-11**] there is resolution of vascular congestion.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
There is a small pneumoperitoneum expected post-op.
[**8-14**] CTA with IV contrast: Left subclavian central venous catheter in place with tip in mid-SVC.
There is moderate multivessel coronary arterial calcifications as well as mitral annular and aortic valve calcifications.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
New small bilateral effusions, left greater than right, with associated atelectasis.
New small perihepatic effusion.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
LENI-IMPRESSION: Acute thrombosis involving the posterior tibial veins in both lower extremities.
Diffuse severe dilatation of the esophagus, stomach, and small bowel loops extending to a few centimeters proximal to the level of the ileocolonic anastomosis.
A transition at this level, raising concern for partial bowel obstruction versus ileus with compression of the small bowel loops.
Small-to-moderate amount of abdominopelvic ascites, with slightly highdensity material in the pelvis, which may be secondary to layering debris or small amount of hemoperitoneum.
No indirect evidence of anastomotic leak.
Limited assessment of the anastomosis due to the lack of intraluminal contrast at this level.
However, no focal fluid collections or free air is seen to suggest disruption of the anastomosis.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute thoracic aortic pathology.
CXR [**8-26**]- Small bilateral pleural effusions and a small region of consolidation at one of the lung bases, probably the right, have increased.
Whether this is atelectasis or pneumonia is radiographically indeterminate.
No pneumothorax.
No definitive evidence of Barretts.
EGD in [**3-10**] years if no dysplasia.

His hospital course was c/b difficult to control atrial fibrillation  #GI bleeding/acute blood loss anemia/total colectomy/severe diverticulosis- Patient presented with GI bleeding which on angiography was found to be associated with right and middle colic arteries (tagged RBC and CTA were negative).
He underwent IR guided angiographic embolization of branches of the R and middle colic arteries at the hepatic flexure but continued to bleed post procedure necesitating total abdominal colectomy with ilio-sigmoid anastomosis.
In the setting of large quantities of IVF and likely prolonged NPO status and acute illness, HCT trended down and he was given 2 more units PRBCs.
There was no sign of active bleeding during this time.
#significant ileus-Pt was noted to have abdominal distention/bloating-CT of the abdomen was performed that showed ileus from anastamosis to esophagus.
NO evidence of leak.
Eventually, symptoms improved, NGT was removed and diet advanced.
He had diarrhea which was negative for C. diffx3 and felt to be due to lack of colon.
He was treated with immodium with reduction in stool volume.
#Atrial fibrillation/Aflutter: Post-operatively patient had difficult to control atrial fibrillation/flutter with rates in the 120s-200s.
He remained hemodynamically stable with these heart rates.
He continued to have tachycardia on almost maximal doses of metoprolol and diltiazem with further tachycardia with exercise.
Workup for atrial fibrillation was notable for normal TSH and absence of infection (no pneumonia on CXR, negative urine culture, neg C. diff).
TTE showed LVEF >55% with mild symmetric LVH and CTA [**8-14**] was negative for PE.
This course became difficult as pt was found to be not absorbing PO pills (found whole in the stool) and meds were continually uptitrated and pt had large GI losses/dehydration and was continually given IVF.
He did well on this and when his ileus resolved, he was continued on oral metoprolol with good control of his heart rate.
#acute DVT-despite Hep SC TID and pneumoboots, pt was found to have b/l DVTs.
Pt did not show any signs of bleeding after initiation of anticoagulation.
His IV heparin was changed to low molecular weight heparin and this will be used to bridge him until the coumadin is therapeutic.
See above, he was given some additional PRBCs for HCT trending down in the absence of apparent bleeding.
#Thrombocytosis: Patient developed thrombocytosis towards end of hospitalization.
This was felt to be related to recovery of the bone marrow from suppression during acute illness as it was associated with a few bands and metamyelocytes but there was no evidence of infection or inflammation and patient was overall improving.
Additionally, there was low suspicion for development of acute clot as patient was on heparin ppx and had had a recent CTA.
#Anxiety: Pt has history of generalized anxiety and patient was given up to 6mg po Ativan as he takes 4mg po Ativan/day at home.
3. lorazepam 0.5-1 mg tablet PO/NG QID PRN anxiety, hold for oversedation 4. pantoprazole 40 mg IV q12 hours 5. metoclopramide 10 mg IV q6 hours 6. hydromorphone PCA 0.12 mg IV, lockout interval 6 minutes, no basal rate, 1-hour max 1.2 mg 7. heparin 5000 units SC TID 8. metoprolol tartrate 75 mg PO/NG TID 9. diltiazam 30mg PO/NG QID 9. ondansetron 8 mg IV q8 hours, PRN N/V  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Anemia Crohn's disease Atrial fibrillation DVT diverticular disease s/p total colectomy   Discharge Condition: Stable Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
