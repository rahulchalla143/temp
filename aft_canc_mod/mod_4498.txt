He was also complaining of lightheadedness and LLQ abdominal pain for three days.
His vitals were notable for hypotension to the 70s and tachycardia to 120, and he was referred to the ED for further evaluation.
His recent oncologic history is notable for completing a course of IL-2 ([**2155-7-18**]), and his melanoma has been complicated by liver hemorrhage from metastatic nodules requiring embolization, brain mets found on MRI in [**10-10**] in the setting of headaches and gait abnormalities, and numerous liver, lung, mesenteric, and retroperitoneal mets.
Surgery was consulted for evaluation and felt excision was likely not indicated, and he was started empirically on vanco and zosyn, with the necrotic mass as the presumed source of infection.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he was comfortable and has no complaints.
no change in bowel habits with one bowel movement per day.
no cough or dyspnea.

Marked interval progression of widespread metastatic disease, including pulmonary, hepatic, gallbladder, mesenteric, retroperitoneal, and subcutaneous lesions.
Large metastatic mass in the left anterior mid abdomen, with adjacent inflammatory stranding, may reflect infarction possibly related to the rapid growth.
Please note, this mass corresponds to site of patient's focal pain as determined by physical exam.
There is marked elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
There is consolidation and effusion at the right lung base as seen on CT.
Known lung metastasis is poorly assessed.
No pneumothorax is seen.

He remained afebrile overnight and throughout the next day.
While it may have been prudent to have Mr. [**Known lastname 8952**] observed another night while off of antibiotics, he had his parents visiting from [**Location (un) **] only for about 1.5 more days before returning to [**Location (un) **].
The patient was given very strict return precautions if he were to develop fever, low blood pressure, or any other sign of worsening condition.
Hypotension/Sepsis:  On admission he met the SIRS criteria with tachycardia and tachypnea.
Aside from the necrotic mass in his left anterior abdomen, the patient had no other localizing source of infection.
The patient's hypotension responded very well to IVF which suggests that he may have been severely volume depleted from decreased PO intake and recent very warm weather.
Bandemia could possibly be [**3-4**] dexamethasone effect.
In any case, if fever were to develop or any other signs of infection, the patient was instructed to return immediately to the hospital for reevaluation and likely reinitiation of antibiotics.
Reconsideration of tissue biopsy of the necrotic mass could be considered to r/o infection.
Metastatic melanoma: Given the numerous metastatic masses previously identified, the newly identified mass likely represents a new metastatic lesion.
No actions were taken regarding additional treatment of his cancer although on transfer to the floor it was recommended that there be follow up with the patients oncologist regarding whether he would potentially be a candidate for anti-BRAF agents ([**2155-8-31**] NEJM article).
Acute kidney injury:  He was admitted with an elevated creatinine to 1.8 from his baseline of 0.6.
It was believed this was secondary to hypovolemia, and was treated as described above.
Nausea:  The patient was admitted with increasing nausea, believed to be secondary to brain mets, liver involvement, and general abdominal involvement of cancer.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to  [**Hospital1 69**] ([**Hospital1 18**]) because of pain in your lower abdomen as well as nausea and decreased ability to eat.
As a result of this pain, you saw your oncologist who found that you had low blood pressure and fast heart rate and sent you to [**Hospital1 18**].
You had a CT of your abdomen which showed a necrotic mass in the left lower quadrant and you were started on fluids and transferred to the ICU.
There was a concern for an infection so you were started on antibiotics.
You continued to do well off antibiotics without evidence of infection.
This may be in the form of fever, chills, cough, burning on urination, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, or confusion.
