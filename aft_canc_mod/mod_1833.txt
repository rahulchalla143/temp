Admission Date:  [**2190-1-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2190-1-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2134-7-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Mold Extracts  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: syncope  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: This is a 55 year old male with h/o HCV and alcoholic cirrhosis with esophageal varices, HCC with cardiac metastasis s/p resection in [**2-/2189**] who now presents with syncope.
There, pt was found to have bilateral PEs that appear old (s/p anticoagulation, stopped several months ago) and a 2.5 cm circumferential pericardial effusion on CT. Pt had low blood pressure at OSH but responded to fluids.
Heparin was not started, given h/o liver disease and malignancy.
Of note, PET CT in [**12/2189**] showed recurrence of RA mass.
An EKG showed NSR 73, low voltage, no ST changes.
A bedside US showed a large pericardial effusion with RV bowing without tamponade physiology and pulsus paradoxus measured 14.
CXR showed a moderate pericardial effusion and metastatic pulmonary nodules.
TTE showed a large right atrial mass extending into the right ventricle and a large circumferential pericardial effusion with brief right ventricular diastolic collapse.
denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis.
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Past Medical History: # HCC - has a history of hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by grade II-III varices - initial surveillance CT performed at an outside hospital in [**9-/2186**] showed a 5-cm mass in the left liver as well as multiple satellite lesions.
- at [**Hospital1 18**] CT on [**2187-12-6**] showed a 9 x 6 cm enhancing mass in the left liver as well as innumerable pulmonary nodules, the largest measuring  9-10 mm.
No lesion was identified by chest CT, liver CT, U/S, or MRI for biopsy.
HCC diagnosis was confirmed on the right atrial mass biopsy on [**2188-4-24**].
Dose was reduced after two weeks due to severe hand/foot syndrome and thrombocytopenia to 200mg [**Hospital1 **].
- Mr. [**Known lastname **] self discontinued sorafenib [**2188-8-17**] due to progressive leg cramps.
OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: Hepatitis C /ETOH cirrhosis c/b 2 cords grade 3 esophageal varices s/p banding most recently [**4-27**].
Status post right BKA after a motorcycle collision in [**2159**] requiring eight surgeries.
History of hospitalization for pneumonia.
H/o upper GI bleed s/p hospitalization [**4-27**]   Social History: Drugs: none Tobacco: 35 years x1 pack per day, continues to smoke.
There is no family history of liver disease or malignancy.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa NECK: Supple, no JVD appreciated CARDIAC: mildly distant heart sounds, RRR.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
well-healed midline scar.
EXTREMITIES: s/p R BKA, left leg with 2+ pitting edema, no erythema or tenderness.
Moderate pericardial effusion.
Metastatic pulmonary nodules.
Fractured superior sternal wire.
[**2190-1-26**] TTE: A large mass is seen in the right atrium extending across the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle.
This mass fills the entire right atrium and it's atrial component measures 5.5x7.4 cm in maximum dimension, with bowing of the inter-atrial septum to the left.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?# leaflets).
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a large circumferential pericardial effusion measuring a maximal dimension of 2.7 cm over the right ventricle.
There is brief, diastolic collapse of the apical right ventricular free wall.
There is no respiratory variation in trans-mitral doppler velocities.
IMPRESSION: Large right atrial mass extending into the right ventricle.
Large circumferential pericardial effusion with brief right ventricular diastolic collapse (mass distending right atrium and basal-mid right ventricle may prevent typical diastolic RA/RV collapse).
New FDG-avid disease occupying the majority of the right atrium, extending from the upper cavo-atrial junction to the hepato-caval venous confluence.
Redemonstration of bilateral FDG-avid pulmonary nodules, increased in size and number from the previous study.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 55 year old male with h/o HCV and alcoholic cirrhosis with esophageal varices, HCC with cardiac metastasis s/p resection in [**2-/2189**] who now presented to OSH with syncope, found to have bilat PEs and pericardial effusion.
# Pericardial effusion: 2.5cm in size, with mild tamponade physiology.
[**2-18**] RA/RV mass see below.
We sent him home on half his home dose of lasix and half home spironolactone with full dose nadolol out of concern for decreasing preload too much and causing tamponade physiology.
CT surgery evaluated the patient for possible surgical resection of the tumor or other procedure but felt that the risks were too high.
It was also felt that a pericardial window was not practical.
Pt is s/p ertotinib which was discontinued on [**2189-12-24**] due to progressive disease further plan per primary oncologist, although prognosis is grim and it appears there is nothing left to offer him.
# Bilat PEs: appear to be chronic.
Pt had a variceal bleed in the past on warfarin for chronic PEs and refused anticoagulation.
# Cirrhosis: We held pts home lasix, spironolactone, and nadolol in the setting of pericardial effusion out of concern for decreasing preload.
# Cough: likely [**2-18**] RA mass and PEs.
low suspicion for pneumonia given normal WBC and absence of fevers at this time and no aspiration history although pt had been drinking the night before.
We continued Tesselon Perles, Tussin PRN as coughing was prompting episodes of desaturation.
