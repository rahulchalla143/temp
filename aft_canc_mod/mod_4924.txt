[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for possible treatment of invasive distal esophageal carcinoma.
This is a patient who has had longstanding gastroesophageal reflux disease and underwent upper GI endoscopy in [**2187-12-30**] due to this complaint and new anemia.
This confirmed Barrett's esophagus with high grade dysplasia, squamous to columnar cells.
He then received endoscopy again for biopsy and was found to be cancerous on pathology and showed adenocarcinoma and showed invasion of the submucosa with deep positive margins.
The patient did not report any dysphagia at this time or odynophagia.
He did not report any weight loss and had no other constitutional signs or symptoms such as fever, chills, night sweats.
FAMILY HISTORY:  He reports a strong family history of gastric carcinoma.
ALLERGIES:  He has no medical allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: He weighed 164 pounds and was afebrile with a pulse in the 80s, blood pressure 136/84, respiratory rate 18, and room air saturation of 94%.
HEENT: He had no scleral icterus.
There is no adenopathy in the neck region anteriorly, posteriorly, or in the supraclavicular fossa.
There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular: Heart in regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The patient was brought to the operating room on the day of admission and underwent the following procedures: Bronchoscopy, left video assisted resection of the lower lobe nodule with biopsy of the left upper lobe, transhiatal esophagectomy and feeding jejunostomy.
The patient in his postoperative course remained intubated and on postoperative day 2 underwent diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy for likely right lower lobe infiltrate found on chest x-ray.
Bronchoscopy revealed a clot in the bronchus intermedius that was evacuated and some residual blood in the bilateral lungs which was aspirated therapeutically.
There was noted to be no active bleeding from many segments of the left or right lung and the patient tolerated the procedure well.
The patient at this point had a nasogastric tube or right internal jugular venous catheter and left sided chest tube in place.
It was noted at this point that the patient had a somewhat persistent ileus, likely as in the postoperative period.
The patient's chest tube had been discharged and followup chest x-rays revealed there to be slight increase in this effusion on the right side.
This actually seemed to gradually resolve and the patient has had no trouble with his respiratory status during this time.
Also of note his [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain had been discharged 4 days before discharge without difficulty and he had been noted to have minimal output in the days leading up to its removal.
His wound had had mild redness, notably the abdominal pain that had gradually resolved during this time.
