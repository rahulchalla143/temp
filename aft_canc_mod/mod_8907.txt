The patient was having exertional angina, status post walking 10 feet, five days prior to the cardiac catheterization.
He also had pain at rest which resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin.
The pain was 2/10 chest pain radiating to the left arm.
The patient had a positive stress and the cardiac catheterization showed triple vessel disease.
He was discharged home with a goal to decrease his white count prior to coronary artery bypass grafting, however, the patient was home for 7 hours after discharge and was laying in bed when he started developing chest pain again which radiated to the left arm which did not resolve with sublingual nitroglycerin.
He was transferred to the Emergency Room at which time he was having nausea and shortness of breath with chest pain.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia 2.
Coronary artery disease 3.
His physical examination was clear to auscultation with regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
His extremities showed no edema and had 2+ pulses distally.
Postoperatively the patient did well without any pressor requirement or inotrope requirement.
At this point he was examined and noted to have erythema and induration at the site of an intravenous line which was located in his left forearm.
The intravenous line was removed and there was pus noted coming from the site of the entry of the intravenous line into the skin.
After a 24 hour period of observation, it was noted that there was not significant improvement in the induration or erythema and pus was expressible from the wound.
The patient tolerated his procedure well and by postoperative day #6 remained afebrile for 24 hours with resolution of the induration of the cellulitis of the left arm.
Given this, it was felt that he was stable for discharge.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, status post chemotherapy times two.
Coronary artery disease, status post angioplasty.
