Pertinent Results: [**Known lastname **],[**Known firstname **]: [**Hospital1 18**] ECG Detail - CCC Record #[**Numeric Identifier 42944**] ELECTROCARDIOGRAM PERFORMED ON: [**2158-7-24**] Sinus tachycardia with complete heart block and independent question fascicular/ventricular escape rhythm.
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities - cannot exlucde ischemia and/or metabolic/drug effect.
Since the previous tracing earlier this date second degree block appears to have progressed to complete heart block and with evident change in QRS morphology.
TRACING #3 Read by: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) 177**] W.  ECHO CARDIOGRAM PERFORMED ON: [**2158-7-26**] Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 35% to 40% Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferior and iseptal hypokinesis.
Right ventricular chamber size appears mildly dilated with borderline free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-16**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

Antibiotics were started empirically for possible pneumonia in the setting of pulmonary edema.
Rhythm became CHB transiently & SBP then dipped to ~80mmHg.
The pt did well with the temporary pacer and was subsequently extubated.
