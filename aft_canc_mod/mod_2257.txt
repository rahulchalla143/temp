Admission Date:  [**2107-6-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2107-6-28**]  Date of Birth:   [**2036-12-3**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MICU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transferred for a stent for a right mainstem bronchus obstruction with squamous cell carcinoma.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70-year-old female admitted to [**Hospital 2079**] Hospital from [**5-30**] through [**6-18**] for dyspnea which was felt secondary to congestive heart failure.
She was treated for congestive heart failure first as a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare during that time and was discharged on [**6-18**].
On [**6-19**], she returned to the hospital because of some right-sided pleuritic chest pain.
Chest x-ray showed a density at the right base with right mediastinal shift.
A CT of the chest showed complete collapse of the right lower lobe secondary to an endobronchial lesion.
There was no evidence of pulmonary embolus.
There was also no evidence of any pleural or pericardial effusion.
She also reportedly had some mediastinal adenopathy and a right hilar mass, reported visible on chest x-rays from [**2106-9-19**], with indeterminate follow-up mediastinoscopy.
The pathology returned that day positive for squamous cell carcinoma.
Obesity with obstructive sleep apnea on BIPAP.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Congestive heart failure.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Chronic back pain.
Chest:  Clear breath sounds on the left but coarse breath sounds on the right superiorly, with absent breath sounds inferiorly.
Without murmurs.
Extremities:  There was mild, chronic venostasis changes without any peripheral edema.
Chest CT done on [**6-19**] showed complete collapse of the right lower lobe secondary to endobronchial lesion.
Respiratory distress:  This was thought to be likely due to endobronchial lesion with postlesion obstruction and collapse of the right lung.
She went to Interventional Bronchoscopy on [**6-22**], which revealed a mass within the right mainstem bronchus occluding the origin of the right upper lobe bronchus, measuring approximately 13 x 9 mm in diameter.
This was excised by Interventional Pulmonology, and the patient returned to the MICU status post excision without endobronchial stent.
After the bronchoscopy, she did have six weeks of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
Initially she did have some thick secretions through her stent which was sent to microbiopsy for speciation, and these eventually grew out pseudomonas sensitive to everything except for ...................  She therefore had initially been started on Zosyn, as well as Levofloxacin and Vancomycin upon admission for the leukocytosis, and gradually her antibiotic regimen was narrowed down to just Zosyn for the pseudomonas pneumonia.
After extubation on the 5th, the patient continued to have some respiratory distress and required face mask, as well as sedation.
Her respiratory distress was felt to be multifactorial from the pseudomonas pneumonia, the possible reactive airway disease flare, and flash pulmonary edema.
She was increased on her benzodiazepines, as she did have a history of taking Xanax more than once a day at home.
Hypertension and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia: The patient did have two episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia throughout her whole hospital course which were six beats and 11 beats in duration.
She had no chest pain.
It is recommended that she follow-up with Cardiology for risk stratification for coronary artery disease, as she does have risk factors.
She was kept on Captopril for hypertension at her Lisinopril dose equivalent.
Her Digoxin, which was presumably prescribed by her physician for congestive heart failure, was discontinued for risk of any arrhythmia affects; however, she was continued on her Lipitor and Lisinopril.
She will be given inhalers with bronchodilators and inhalers for control of her reactive airway disease.
She did have two episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response which lasted less than a few minutes each time, resolving spontaneously without medication.
She was however prescribed Diltiazem for the rate control, and no further episodes of atrial fibrillation or flutter occurred.
Oncology, squamous cell carcinoma:  The patient did have excision of her endobronchial lesion which was squamous cell carcinoma.
On CT, it was noted that she had an extra bronchial mass adjacent to the endobronchial lesion.
Also noted was a lobulated mass in the region of the right hilum which appeared to extend to the adjacent fissure.
There was also reportedly an enlarged lower right paratracheal lymph node and also enlarged subcarinal nodes.
Also noted was a possible lower right cervical lymph node measuring approximately 2 x 2.
A CT of the head with contrast was performed to look for CNS metastases of which there was no evidence.
Squamous cell carcinoma with adjacent lymphadenopathy at the hilum and mediastinum, no evidence of brain metastases.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Obstructive sleep apnea on BIPAP.
Congestive heart failure.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Chronic back pain.
FOLLOW-UP:  The patient has been referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the Division of Pulmonology for follow-up of her obstructive sleep apnea, as well as squamous cell carcinoma, appointment scheduled for [**7-13**], 9:45 a.m. with pulmonary function testing.
