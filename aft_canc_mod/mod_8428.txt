The patient states that he heard a lot of rumbling and borborygmi in the abdomen, would have a somewhat urgent need to move his bowels.
He did not have any significant lower abdominal cramps associated with this.
There has been no associated weight loss.
When symptoms were more intense, he may have had some nausea but no vomiting.
He has had no foreign travel history.
Labs were unremarkable except for a slightly low white blood cell count, and a tissue transglutaminase IgA antibody was well within normal limits.
A second course of Flagyl seemed to improve the situation slightly since he states that now, although his stools are slightly looser than usual, he does not have as much gas or foul-smelling stools.
A colonoscopy with biopsies showed carcinoid tumor to be the cause of his issues.
