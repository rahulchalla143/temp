Admission Date: [**2200-4-6**]        Discharge Date: [**2200-4-19**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old male with history of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, CAD, ventricular tachycardia, status post implantable defibrillator with newly diagnosed right upper lobe [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital6 2561**] for right main stem bronchus stent for recurrent ex vacuo effusion, status post thoracentesis times three.
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2200-2-17**], with ventricular tachycardia following a motor vehicle accident.
He was then readmitted on [**2200-3-26**], for a recurrent pleural effusion, for which he received a pigtail catheter and consideration of possible pleurodesis.
However, he was not a candidate for pleurodesis secondary to the pleural effusion ex vacuo.
On [**2200-4-4**], the patient became acutely short of breath with drop in sense requiring non- rebreather.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a right main stem bronchus shunt to hopefully resolve his pleural effusion ex vacuo, which was thought to be secondary to right lobar collapse secondary to his obstruction.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, hypertension, CAD status post MI in [**2197**], status post LAD stent, catheterization in [**2194**] showed three-vessel disease with 50 percent narrowing of the LAD, 30 percent narrowing of the proximal SARC and 60 percent narrowing of the marginal branch.
Echo in [**2198-11-18**], showed an EF of 50 percent, mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]; and a normal pulmonary artery pressure, history of ventricular tachycardia status post implantable defibrillator, right upper lobe mass diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma, no endobronchial disease on bronchoscopy done at [**Hospital1 336**] (status post pleuracentesis, fluid was non malignant, MRI revealed mediastinal involvement, thus the patient was considered non- resectable; status post 12 radiation treatments in addition to a course of Paxil and carboplatin), hypercholesterolemia, and history of atrial fibrillation, taken off Coumadin four weeks ago.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Brother was deceased in his 50s secondary to lung cancer with positive history of tobacco, multiple members with early CAD.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is positive tobacco, 0.5 packs per day times 50 years, no alcohol, and worked as a fish cutter in the past.
In general, the patient is intubated, sedated in no apparent distress.
Cardiovascular, bradycardia with regular rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Pulmonary, coarse breath sounds on the left, poor air movement on the right.
Abdomen, normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities, 1 to 2 plus pitting edema in the upper extremities, left greater than the right, no clubbing or cyanosis.
EKG, paced at 66 beats per minute, left bundle branch block, questionable new T-wave inversion in V5- V6.
Chest x-ray, right upper lobe collapse, positive atelectasis/wide-out of the remainder of the right lung.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 75-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, CAD status post MI and LAD stent, ventricular tachycardia status post defibrillator, transferred from [**Hospital6 2561**] for right main stem bronchus stent for obstructing right lung mass, diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma complicated by an ex vacuo pleural effusion.
The patient presents with a diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer identified as stage 3B squamous carcinoma with mediastinal involvement by MRI with a non- malignant ex vacuo pleural effusion and associated lung collapse, status post 12 radiation treatments and a course of Paxil and carboplatin.
Plan for an initial right main stem bronchus stent, however, bronchoscopy revealed multiple endobronchial lesions, thus be more appropriate treatment was thought to be photodynamic therapy.
Right pleural effusion ex vacuo.
Due to the patient's obstructing mass leading to a pleural effusion ex vacuo, the patient suffered hypoxic respiratory failure.
It was accidentally dislodged, but ultimately required replacement as the patient had respiratory decompensation.
His hypotension was initially thought to be due to decreased pre- loads secondary to increased inter-chest pressures from his pleural effusion ex vacuo and positive pressure ventilation.
During this hospital stay, the patient became septic from likely pulmonary source and required increasing amounts of pressors for support.
The patient's beta-blocker was held due to his hypotension.
Troponins were slightly elevated at level of 0.05; however, CK MB remained negative, and EKG unchanged.
The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia, but was paced at a rate of 66 on presentation and remained in sinus.
The patient had significant amount of third spacing; however, no evidence of obvious heart failure.
This was thought to be secondary to third spacing from aggressive fluid resuscitation.
Neutropenic fever.
The patient with low-grade fever in the setting of neutropenia.
Vancomycin was later added for persistent hypotension, but was subsequently discontinued when the patient was able to be weaned off all pressors.
The patient was administered GCSF in hopes of recovering his white blood count and this medication was discontinued when he was no longer neutropenic.
Unfortunately, the patient developed worsening functions.
Sputum culture grew Gram-negative rods with moderate Haemophilus.
Unfortunately, the patient subsequently developed a copious amounts of diarrhea, and was empirically treated for C. Diff.
KUB was assessed during the course of his ICU stay and was negative for toxic megacolon.
Ultimately, the patient's ceftazidime was discontinued secondary to drop in platelets and eminent death as this medication was thought to be doing more harm than good.
Acute renal failure.
The patient presented with elevated creatinine.
The patient's progressive worsening renal failure was thought to be due to HEN and secondary to hypotension and sepsis.
The patient maintained on PPI, subcutaneous Heparin, and neutropenic precautions.
His daughter had significant difficulties with the decision making.
Multiple staff were uncomfortable with perceived discomfort on the part of the patient.
