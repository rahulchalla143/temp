Leptomeningeal enhancement along pons and cerebellum suggestive of meningeal inflammation/infection.
Parenchymal volume loss which may be related to the patient's underlying HIV or alcohol use.
Endplate destruction with near obliteration of the intervertebral disc space at L4-5, which may represent the sequela of prior infection given the patient's history.
There are no findings specific for ongoing infection at this time, with no evidence of surrounding edema, enhancement, or evidence of epidural involvement.
No evidence of spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing in the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar spine.
Linear enhancement along the ventral aspect of the cord likely represents a vessel, but is difficult to fully characterize given the large field of view and decreased resolution.
Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
Small cyst in the left liver lobe.
Cholelithiasis and sludge within the gallbladder, with mild wall thickening of the gallbladder wall, an unchanged finding that could suggest HIV cholangiopathy or relate to chronic liver disease.
Multiple calcifications in the pancreas in keeping with chronic pancreatitis.
New acute infarcts in the cerebellar hemispheres on both sides, the right middle cerebellar peduncle and the inferior cerebellar peduncle with mildly increased enhancement on the surface of the pons and the right temporal lobe, related to leptomeningeal enhancement.
Coarsened hepatic architecture with no focal solid mass identified.
Unchanged small left hepatic cyst.
Trace of ascites in the perihepatic space, but no pocket suitable for paracentesis could be located in the lower quadrants.

Initial concern was for meningitis given presentation and risk factors.
LP showed purulent CSF with no culture growth.
He was started vanc and ceftriaxone for empiric coverage.
Patient was 100.0 in the ED and remained afebrile throughout his [**Last Name (un) 10128**].
Patient underwent head CT which initially showed no pathology.
On [**12-11**], patient noted to have new left-sided paralysis in arm, leg, left face.
MRI showed acute pontine infarct at the level of his leptomeningeal disease.
Most likely, it was secondary to inflammation.
Discussed patient with our attending and initiated empiric treatment for TB meningitis given high mortality for untreated TB.
Patient became tachypneic on AM of [**12-18**] and went into respiratory distress leading to a code blue.
CXR showed new left consolidation with left retrocardiac opacity and increased left pleural effusion (concern for pneumonia, per radiology) so patient treated for VAP.
Given transaminitis and elevated t-bili, TB medications were discontinued per Liver team recs.
Mental status remained at level prior to MICU transfer despite active treatment.
Repeat MRI showed new bilateral cerebellar infarcts.
Patient remained tachycardic throughout course.
Potential etiologies include PE, infection, or centrally mediated process in patient with known leptomeningeal inflammation and pontine CVA.
Patient thought to have mucus-plugged leading to acute desaturations requiring MICU transfers.
# Hyponatremia: Patient became hyponatremic to 119 during course.
Thought to be secondary to SIADH.
Renal consulted, lytes sent.
# Cirrhosis:  Patient developed worsening synthetic function over the course of his hospital stay with progressively worsening hyperbilirubinemia.
Underwent RUQ- showed coarsened hepatic architecture with no focal solid mass identified.
There was an unchanged small left hepatic cyst with trace of ascities in the perihepatic space.
He was given lactulose regularly given concern for hepatic encephatology.
# IDDM: HISS and accuchecks.
