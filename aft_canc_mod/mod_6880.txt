-Femoral line placement  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 49957**] is a 66 year-old woman with a history of lung cancer who presents after being found down by her family  She was found down by her son tonight and it is beleived she has been down since early afternoon of [**3-5**].
Hyperkalemia was treated with calcium, [**Date Range 31217**], bicarb and kayexalate.
Lung cancer: CT chest ([**2149-9-5**]) shows right infrahilar mass 2.
Diabetes 3.
Anicteric CV: Regular.
No apparent tenderness.
OP with moist mucosa, no erythema.
+BS, mild distended.
No apparent tenderness.
ET tube just above the thoracic inlet and could be advanced slightly for standard positioning.
Nodular opacity in the left lung concerning for mass lesion adjacent to wedge resection site.
This is further evaluated on subsequent CT.  CT head without contrast, read on outside study: Numerous hypodense lesions with areas of hyperdensity concerning for diffuse metastatic disease.
Extensive vasogenic edema surrounding many of these lesions is noted.
Left upper lobe mass, ill-defined lesions within the liver and left adrenal nodule are identified.
These are incompletely evaluated without contrast and are concerning for neoplastic disease given patient's history of metastatic brain disease.
Nonspecific mesenteric fat stranding which may be related to the pancreas.
No evidence of free air or free fluid.
Bilateral atelectasis accompanied by bilateral pleural effusions are grossly unchanged.
There is interval decrease in the degree of pulmonary edema otherwise no significant change since the prior study is demonstrated.
The left upper lobe lesion demonstrated on CT torso from [**2151-3-6**] is seen but the CT technique characterized better dimensions of the mass.
MRI BRAIN [**2151-3-10**] IMPRESSION: Numerous lesions in both cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres, the largest with central cystic-appearing necrosis and many, hemorrhagic with blood products of varying ages, consistent with extensive metastatic disease.
These demonstrate significant associated vasogenic edema (despite the history of corticosteroid therapy x 3 days), with the right inferior frontal lesion demonstrating associated slight leftward deviation of the septum pellucidum and possible early trapping of the contralateral lateral ventricle.
There is no uncal or downward transtentorial herniation at this time.
The findings on DWI are somewhat unusual in metastatic disease and raise the possibility of a markedly hypercellular aggressive neoplasm with cystic necrosis.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 66 year old female with history of lung cancer, now presenting with DKA/HHS and ARF after being found down.
#  Altered mental status / Brain mets:  The most likely cause for this patient's altered mental status was felt to be cerebral edema secondary cerebral edema from a large amout of brain metastasis.
Her cerebral edema was treated with steroids, and her mental status improved greattly.
When the patient's mental status clear she was found to have new focal neurologic deficits.
Hypotonic fluids were avoided given cerebral edema concerns.
#  Diabetes Type II/HONK:  The patient presented with likely Hyperosmolar non-ketoic acidosis and she was started on an insuln drip which was switched to sliding scale after her AG closed.
#  Acute kidney injury:  This is likely from volume depletion and has responded to IVF.
CK peaked at 7800 and trended downward; she likely did not have rhabdomyolysis.
# Elevated lipase / acute pancreatitis at presentation: Lipase >800 with CT showing some mesenteric stranding consistent with pancreatitis at presentation.
Once the patient's mental status improved she did not complain of any clinical symptoms of pancreatitis.
# Back pain:  The patient complains of back pain likely secondary to immobility.
A dedicated spinal CT was not done as the patient did not have spinal tenderness, rectal tone was normal, and the patient and family did not want to persue palliative radiation tx to that area.
Plan is for aggressive pain control.
# Urinary incontinence - The patient's foley was removed and she subsequently had urinary incontinence that did not improve over several days.
# Insommnia - The patient has had difficulty with insomnia possible secondary to pain and steroids.
# Constipation - The patient was having constipation despite standing senna and colace.
# FEN - Diabetic diet.
# PPX - PPI, heparin sq # Access - PIV # Code - DNR/DNI  Medications on Admission: 1.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day): hold for loose stools.
Polyethylene Glycol 3350 100 % Powder Sig: One (1) packet PO once a day as needed for constipation.
PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
Trazodone 100 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for sleep.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Oaks Long Term Care Facility - [**Location (un) 5503**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Lung cancer metastatic to brain causing cerebral edema and altered mental status Diabetic Ketoacidosis  Secondary Diagnoses: Hypernatremia Urinary Incontinence Urinary tract infection (treatment started [**2151-3-15**]) Back pain Insommnia Constipation  Diabetes Mellitus type II  Discharge Condition: fair  Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 49957**], You were admitted to the ICU after being found down and unresponsive.
Your altered mental status was most likely due metastatic spread of your lung cancer to your brain and subsequent brain swelling.
You and your family members spoke with several consulting teams regarding further treatment of your metastatic lung cancer and you declined further aggressive treatment in favor of comfort care.
