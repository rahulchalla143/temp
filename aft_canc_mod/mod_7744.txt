Admission Date:  [**2112-9-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2112-9-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2032-3-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: dysarthric speech & gait difficulties  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2112-9-2**] 1.
Suboccipital craniotomy for resection of right cerebellar metastases, opening greater than 5 cm, autologous duraplasty using pericranial graft.
Right-sided frontal EVT placement.
He had a wide local excision completely excised with residual superficial spreading melanoma.
Routine chest x-ray in [**2112-2-6**] showed multiple bilateral nodular opacities measuring up to 1-2 cm.
A left upper lobe wedge biopsy was consistent with metastatic melanoma.
A CT scan also showed a 10.5 mm pericarinal lymph node and MRI of the head showed two metastatic lesions, one in the left frontal and one in the right inferior frontal.
One month followup MRI on [**5-2**], [**2112**], showed resolution of the right frontal met to 50% decrease of the left frontal met.
Good response of lung mets on [**2112-6-6**], torso CT. His second cycle of Temodar was interrupted for diarrhea and then was restarted in the end of [**Month (only) **].
The abdominal and pelvic CT was negative for disease.
The patient states that since last being seen, he has been having some difficulties with double vision, unsteady gait, and some incoordination.
He denies any headaches, no nausea or vomiting.
The diplopia has been for four days and his  imbalance has been for two weeks.
Atrial fibrillation, on anticoagulation.
Excision of the facial melanoma 2.
Family History: No melanoma in his family.
CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient has a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border.
Extraocular movements were intact on the left, but he did have a mild right sixth palsy.
There was no nystagmus.
Neck was soft and supple.
There was no extinction to double simultaneous stimulation.
With gait, he did appear actually to have a difficulty positioning his left foot somewhat  and not so much with the right.
There was some unsteadiness of the gait and he was unable to tandem, however, he was able to toe and heel walk reasonably well.
Small amount of pneumocephalus is seen layering anteriorly in the anterior and middle cranial fossae.
There has been interval placement of a right frontal intraventricular catheter, which terminates near the right-sided foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**].
There is a small amount of hemorrhage layering within the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
The known hemorrhagic metastasis is again identified within the right posterior parietal lobe with surrounding edema.
There is a small amount of mucosal thickening within the right maxillary sinus.
There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.
However, in the interval, there is loss of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white junction, and hypodensity in the right frontal lobe, most likely indicating a subacute infarction.
The previously identified hyperdense mass with vasogenic edema in the right parietal lobe is stable.
Pneumocephalus in the right cranial hemisphere overlying the right frontal lobe is again seen, though smaller than the previous exam.
Also noted is craniotomy defect overlying the right subocciput, a defect in the brain tissue at the right cerebellum and surrounding edema, and small foci of hyperdensity, all consistent with postoperative changes, and not significantly changed in the interval.
IMPRESSION: Interval development of subacute infarct in right middle cerebral artery territory  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2112-9-5**] 11:45 PM FINDINGS: There is interval development of hemorrhage into a subacute right frontal lobe infarction, as indicated by new hyperdensity, and there is expansion of the affected area.
Mass effect is increased and there is narrowing of the right lateral ventricle and mild shift of the midline structures to the left.
The large right parietal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and postoperative changes in the cerebellum are unchanged.
Additional hemorrhages in the right caudate head and left medial cerebellar hemisphere are stable.
The degree of pneumocephalus is slightly less compared to yesterday.
IMPRESSION: Expanded infarction and new hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe  Pathology [**2112-9-2**] Tissue diagnosis Cerebellum with METASTATIC MALIGNANT MELANOMA Note:  Immunohistochemistry reveals positive staining for melanoma antigen HMB-45.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient admitted on day of surgery for elective suboccipital craniotomy for resection of right cerebellar metastasis (from melanoma) with autologous duraplasty using pericranial graft.
Post-operatively the patient remained intubated, initially secondary to prone position of the surgery to protect the airway from edema post-op.
A CT showed post-op changes in addition to a previously identified metastasis in the right posterior parietal lobe.
A new right sided MCA infarct was seen on the CT in addition to slightly increased amount of hemorrhage into a parietal metastasis.
A repeat CT on POD#3 showed interval worsening of the infarct with new hemorrhage into that area.
