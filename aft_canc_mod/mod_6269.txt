Nuclear stress test on [**2147-4-18**] showed EF of 49% with large inferior MI with mild to moderately reduced LV function and mild residual inferolateral hypoperfusion.
Patient nausea and diaphoresis on [**2147-4-23**] night and was diagnosed with NSTEMI and acute heart failure.
Coumadin was held for possible cardiac catheterization.
Past Medical History: - Inferior MI [**2131**] s/p CABG at [**Hospital1 336**] LIMA to RCA, left saphenous vein graft to OM1, OM2 and LAD - Acute on chronic systolic heart failure - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - S/p right total knee replacement on [**2147-4-20**] - Fatty liver - Benign kidney tumor - Depression   Social History: Married.
FINDINGS:  The small right pleural effusion has increased on today's examination.
A new small to moderate left pleural effusion with associated left lower lobe atelectasis is new on today's examination.
The patient is redo status post CABG with new sternotomy wires, none of which are broken or displaced.
There is no pneumothorax.
The heart size is mildly enlarged but stable.
Status post redo CABG with a small to moderate left pleural effusion and adjacent left lower lobe atelectasis.
Small right pleural effusion.
Left ventricular function.
Mildly dilated LV cavity.
Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction.
AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior hypokinesis and inferolateral akinesis.
There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 35%).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with moderate regional systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2147-5-5**], significant tricuspid regurgitation is no longer appreciated.
