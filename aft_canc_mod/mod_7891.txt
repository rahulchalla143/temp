On [**2139-7-16**], CT Lspine showed expansion and further destruction of L3 lytic lesion with soft tissue extension on the left side.
MRI on [**2139-8-21**] was notable for metastasis to L3 vertebral body with compression and left paraspinal mass with 75% narrowing of the spinal canal at L3 level due to retropulsion and epidural mass.
H/O adenomatous polyps resected in [**2131**] 10.
Mass on left lower abdominal wall resected [**2134**], subsequently found to be a schwannoma  Social History: He is Russian speaking.

# Urinary incontinence - known spinal cord compression on exam but stable since last imaging, pt without new weakness or saddle anesthesia and good rectal tone so may be related to prostate pathology instead; UA neg for infxn - have d/c'd decadron - bladder scan showed 750cc urine - need to place foley .
# Pain mgmt- difficult b/c pt appears in pain at times, but as per family he is anxious and cannot easily express this.
Also he appears to be having narcotic toxicity - increase fentanyl patch to 50mcg - d/c dilaudid as may be cause of confusion and nausea - oxycodone for BT - Ativan PRN for anxiety .
# Prostate CA - concern for disease progression as as pt with urinary retention - urology consult .
# Plasmacytoma - concern for spinal cord compression, but MRI does not show change from prior - Ortho Spine performed decompression of L3 lesion with posterior stabilization from L1-5.
# B12 deficiency- pt no longer deficient, will d/c supplementation .
# CKD - at baseline creatinine .
