His stools were guaiac positive and he has a sacral decubitus ulcer.
On the floor, the patient had active melena(about 7 pm) which given his anticoagulation status and difficulty with blood products was felt to require intensive care monitoring.

Blood smear without large amount of hemolysis .
EKG: sinus with atrial ectopic foci, vs. ectopic atrial rhythm, RBBB, 1st (present on EKG at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab), 1st degree AV block, no signs acute ischemia .
EGD [**2158-9-1**]: Small hiatal hernia ,Normal stomach.
No fresh or old blood seen.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  CXR [**2158-9-2**]: no acute infiltrate, possible [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1915**] and mild vascular congestion, costophrenic angles clears .
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with overall low normal left ventricular systolic function.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
No fresh or old blood seen.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum .
There was limited visualization of the colon- especially the right colon.
No large lesion noted  Brief Hospital Course: 88 year old male with mechanical aortic valve on warfarin and hx of gastric ulcer who presented with melena and altered mental status.
# GI bleed: Patient was admitted to the floor on [**2158-8-30**] but transferred to the MICU due to melena and low blood pressure.
Patient was started on proton pump inhibitor drip and transferred to floor after stabilization of hematocrit and vital signs.
Patient was started on heparin drip and developed recurrent bouts of hematemesis.
Patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
He was started on metoprolol 5mg IV every six hours with resolution of atrial fibrillation.
By discharge, his hematocrit was stable in the high 20s with no sign of active bleeding.
# Aortic valve replacement with mechanical valve [**2151**]: Given acute gastrointestinal bleeds with anticoagulation, warfarin was held until colonoscopy was conducted.
# Atrial fibrillation: with one episode of rapid ventricular response that resolved with metoprolol IV and amiodarone drip.
# Chronic diastolic heart failure: Echo on [**2158-9-4**] showsed ejection fraction of 50%.
# H/o CAD s/p NSTEMI: Aspirin and beta blocker were held given gastrointestinal bleed.
Given recent GI bleed and patient's being on warfarin, aspirin was held on discharge with decision to restart deferred to outpatient cardiologist.
