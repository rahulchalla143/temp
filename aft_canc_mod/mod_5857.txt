FINDINGS:  Mild atelectasis is noted at the lung bases.
There are no pleural effusions.
ABDOMEN:  The liver is mildly heterogeneous with a slightly irregular contour, consistent with known cirrhosis.
Note is made of a recanalized umbilical vein and mild gastrohepatic varices.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Multiple bilateral renal cysts are present.
There are no renal stones, masses, or hydronephrosis.
The small bowel demonstrates a slightly unusual configuration, likely post-surgical.
There is a moderate amount of retained fecal material throughout the transverse and sigmoid colon.
There is a 4 x 4 cm right adnexal cystic lesion with single internal septation, which previously measured 4.3 x 3.5 cm.
Small bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias are present, left greater than right.
Scattered calcifications are noted in the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries, with patent branch vessel origins.
Scattered retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes measure up to 6 mm in short axis.
There is no free intraperitoneal fluid or air.
Mild degenerative changes are noted in the thoracolumbar spine, with grade 1 anterolisthesis at L4-L5.
Moderate diffuse disc bulges are noted at L3-L4 through L5-S1, with impingement of the thecal sac outline; please note that CT cannot visualize intrathecal detail.
Moderate facet hypertrophy and ligamentum flavum thickening are also present.
Acutely increased splenomegaly, may reflect infection or lymphoproliferative process.
Moderate hiatal hernia.
US: The transabdominal ultrasound did not allow visualization of the uterus or the ovaries; therefore, we proceeded to a transvaginal examination.
Multiple, partially calcified fibroids distort the endometrial cavity.
There is a large predominantly cystic mass in the right ovary.
The left ovary measures 2.6 x 2 x 2 cm and contains multiple small cysts as well as a small calcified lesion measuring 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm.
No free fluid seen in the pelvis.
The large cystic mass in the right ovary has some complex features, with multiple internal septations, some of which demonstrate vascularity and concerning for neoplasm.
Multiple small cysts seen in the left ovary are also atypical in a postmenopausal woman and this should also be evaluated by OB/GYN.
Multiple internal septations are seen some with slight thickening.
No nodular components are present.
The left ovary measures 2.8 x 1.5 cm and contains many physiologic follicles The uterus is anteverted with multiple T1 and T2 hypoattenuating masses demonstrating significant enhancement.
It demonstrates progressive enhancement.
An avidly enhancing exophytic anterior fibroid is also present measuring 2.2 x 2.4 cm.
There is trace fluid in the endometrial canal.
No significant free fluid is present within the pelvis.
No significant pelvic sidewall or inguinal adenopathy.
No pericolonic stranding.
Within the right iliac fossa is an atrophic, abnormally appearing right renal transplant measuring 5.6 x 2.6 cm with diffuse irregular enhancement.
Multilevel lower lumbar degenerative disease.
No abnormal fluid collections.
Well-circumscribed multiseptated right adnexal lesion is present containing fluid content.
Septations appear smooth throughout though some of the septations are mildly thickened.
Though enhancement cannot be assessed without contrast, no definite nodular components or adjacent inflammatory changes are present.
This lesion has features suggesting mucinous cystadenoma of the ovary.
If no surgical intervention is planned, consider follow up imaging with MR or US to assess for continued stability.
Left ovary with multiple physiologic follicles.
No free fluid.

She became hypotensive in the ED and required fluid rescusitation in MICU overnight with an unclear cause of her hypotension.
# Hypotension: The differential diganosis for her hypotension was broad, but it was felt that she had been taking her anti-hypertensives incorrectly and her hypotension corrected with volume.
Additional causes of hypotension including adrenal insufficieny, hypothyroidism, and sepsis were all entertained.
# R ovarian mass:  She presented with focal RLQ abdominal pain that was concerning for malignancy, but after consultation with Gyn/Onc, it was felt that the mass was not cancer and should be followed with serial imaging.
# Chronic Pain:  She has been on methadone for chronic pain.
# ESRD: Due to her hypocalcemia when she presented, there was concern that it may have caused her hypotension.
Her LT's were mildly elevated during this admission, but otherwise stable.
She has tender splenomegaly and portal or mesenteric vein thrombosis could be considered.
# CAD:  Her last Cath showed that she did not have significant Coronary artery disease.
# Coagulopathy: She had a mildly elevated INR which was thought to be secondary to underlying poor synthetic liver function .
# Thrombocytopenia: Her thrombocytopenia was thought to be secondary to her cirrhosis and was stable during this admission.
# Anemia of CKD: She receives erythropoietin as an outpatient.
# Seizure Disorder: She was continued on her levetiracetam .
# Depression/Anxiety: She was continued on her clonazepam and fluoxetine.
4. clonazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for anxiety.
11. trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Hypotension Right ovarian mass  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital for treatment of low blood pressure and a right ovarian mass.
After doing an ultrasound and MRI, we determined that the right ovarian mass is unlikely to be cancer.
