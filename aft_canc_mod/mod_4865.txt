She had been feeling weak and fatigued and had had some shortness of shortness leading up to this point.
She first noticed these symptoms about a week prior to admission to OHS.
CT of the abdomen at OSH ([**2192-5-15**]) showed a 5.5cm right renal tumor with extension into the renal vein and IVC.
- PET scan at OSH ([**2192-5-18**])showed no increased uptake in the RLL 2cm nodule but increased uptake in right kidney and in the left hilum of the lung.
She went to an emergency room there and was found to have an elevated D-dimer, and on CAT scan was found to have bilateral pulmonary emboli.
However, she had a CAT scan of the abdomen that showed a 5.5 cm right renal mass with extension to the renal vein and inferior vena cava.
There was also noted to be a 2 cm right lung lower lobe nodule.
She also had a PET scan there that was noted to show some increased uptake in the hilum of the left lung.
An MRI of the head was also performed that was found to be unremarkable and to show no signs of metastases.
Her history is also significant for depression for which she is treated with Klonopin and Effexor, and it is noted to be well-controlled by the patient and her family.
She has reflux symptoms since age 26.
Family History: Mother died of lung cancer and she was a noted smoker.
Daughter had congestive heart failure in a pregnancy and delivered prematurely.
There is no history of DVT or pulmonary emboli noted in the family.
No acute distress, comfortable.
No murrmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Chest with mild end-inspiratory crackles at right base.
Otherwise clear, no wheezes.
Abdomen is mildly obese.
No rebout tenderness.
No erythema or discharge about the wound.
Extremities with significant post-operative edema extending to thighes, back, but improving.
Since the prior study, there has been removal of the right IJ line, no evidence of pneumothorax.
Partial atelectasis involving the right middle lobe is again noted as well as the left lower lobe partial atelectasis.
No hiatal hernia is suspected.
Some left pleural effusion is suspected in the posterior costophrenic angle.
IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of the right IJ line and no evidence of pneumothorax.
Areas of partial atelectasis involving the lower lobes bilaterally as well as the right middle lobe.
Small left pleural effusion.

The estimated blood loss was 8 liters.
Chest radiography was obtained and confirmed good re-expansion of lungs without pneumothorax, and atelectasis at the bases bilaterally.
