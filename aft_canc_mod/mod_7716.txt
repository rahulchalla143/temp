Admission Date:  [**2112-8-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2112-8-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2061-10-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Nsaids / Penicillins / Codeine / Tricyclic Antidepressant / Demerol / Talwin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5341**] Chief Complaint: Alteration in mental status.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right hemicraniectomy  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 50 year old man with a right frontal glioma s/p resection and recent XRT treatment now presenting with increased lethargy on [**2112-8-3**].
The patient was recently discharged from the [**Hospital1 **] Neurology service on [**2112-7-14**] for a biopsy and resection of his right frontal mass.
In the interval time, he has been in rehab at [**Hospital1 **] and while there, he has been noted to be inattentive, disinhibited and with poor insight, in addition to mild left sided weakness.
He did fall to the ground about 2 days prior after an "aggressive episode of shaking" but appeared to be at his baseline following that event.
No more seizure activity has been noted.
Past Medical History: -h/o right frontal gliomatosis cerebri -h/o narcotic abuse -osteoarthritis - Hepatitis + A/B/C   Social History: -lives at [**Hospital1 **] -at baseline had been walking with a cane -long h/o tobacco use -h/o narcotic abuse  Family History: -not available  Physical Exam: Exam upon admission: Vitals:  101.1  97  105/59  97% General: scar on right frontal area Neck: supple Lungs: clear to auscultation CV: Regular rate and rhythm Abdomen:  non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present Ext: warm, no edema  Neurologic Examination upon admission: eyes closed, will open eyes to loud voice but quickly shuts them, not following commands, frequently attempts to sit-up, arms in restraints; pupils appear equally reactive, eye looking toward right and midline; mild left facial; increased tone on left; spontaneous mvt x4 but more brisk on right; withdraws to pain more vigorously on right arm and leg; dtrs, 2+ throughout, toe up on left, down on right   Pertinent Results: [**2112-8-3**] 01:02PM BLOOD WBC-11.0 RBC-4.17* Hgb-13.7* Hct-39.7* MCV-95 MCH-32.8* MCHC-34.5 RDW-14.4 Plt Ct-188 [**2112-8-3**] 01:02PM BLOOD Neuts-83.4* Lymphs-11.4* Monos-4.2 Eos-0.3 Baso-0.8 [**2112-8-3**] 01:02PM BLOOD PT-11.9 PTT-27.1 INR(PT)-1.0 [**2112-8-3**] 01:02PM BLOOD Glucose-120* UreaN-17 Creat-0.8 Na-136 K-3.8 Cl-98 HCO3-24 AnGap-18 [**2112-8-3**] 01:02PM BLOOD ALT-123* AST-105* CK(CPK)-134 AlkPhos-124* Amylase-37 TotBili-0.7 [**2112-8-3**] 01:02PM BLOOD Albumin-4.2 Calcium-9.1 Phos-4.4 Mg-2.1 [**2112-8-3**] 01:02PM BLOOD Phenyto-9.9*  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2112-8-3**]) FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Right-sided uncal herniation also is present.
There is also increasing effacement of the quadrigeminal plate cistern consistent with transtentorial herniation.
The previously seen area of possible hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe, likely the biopsy site, has since resolved.
A small amount of low attenuation fluid is seen in that area related to post-interventional changes.
The large right frontal lobe lesion is difficult to see on this study, compared with prior MR study, but is likely unchanged.
Minimal circumferential mucosal thickening is seen in the right maxillary sinus, and a minimal amount of mucosal thickening in the antrum of the left maxillary sinus.
Remaining visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
Worsening right-to-left subfalcine herniation, and new right-sided uncal herniation and transtentorial herniation.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Since yesterday's examination, the patient has undergone right hemicraniectomy with decompression, with expected postoperative pneumocephalus and extra-axial hemorrhage at the site of the surgical defect.
There is persistent 8 mm leftward shift of the septum pellucidum (this measured 11 mm, previously), with subfalcine herniation, effacement of the right and "trapping" of the left lateral ventricles.
However, there has been significant improvement in the degree of right uncal herniation with improvement in the appearance of the basilar cisterns, indicative of improvement in the degree of downward transtentorial herniation.
The cerebral aqueduct and fourth ventricle remain uneffaced, and there is no evidence of tonsillar herniation.
The poorly defined, infiltrative large mass centered in the deep [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter of the right frontal lobe remains relatively occult on CT examination.
IMPRESSION: Right hemicraniectomy and decompression with significant improvement in right uncal and downward transtentorial herniation, persistent subfalcine herniation with trapping of the left lateral ventricle.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2112-8-8**]): FINDINGS: Comparison with the prior study shows continued extensive right to left subfalcine herniation and accompanying compression of the right lateral ventricle.
There appears to be very little change in the extent of contralateral left lateral ventricular dilatation.
There is no evidence for the presence of intracranial hemorrhage that has developed since the prior study.
A patchy opacity in the left lower lobe likely represents pneumonia.
There is no evidence of a left pleural effusion, and no right pleural effusion.
There is no pulmonary edema.
IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe pneumonia.
ABNORMALITY #2: There were additional bursts of generalized slowing.
There were also occasional bursts of additional delta slowing in the right frontal region or left temporal region, but these were minimal.
SLEEP: The patient appeared to remain awake or drowsy throughout most of the record.
No stage II sleep was obtained.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing.
These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathic condition affecting both cortical and  subcortical structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and  infection are among the most common causes.
There were a few bursts of focal slowing but no areas of persistent focal slowing.
There were no epileptiform features.
Extensive right to left subfalcine herniation and compression of the right lateral ventricle, which was seen on the prior examination.
There is no new intracranial hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 50yo man with h/o glioblamotosis cerebri who presented with altered mental status and for radiation treatment for his tumor.
His repeat head CT showed some mild improvement, but he continued to have significant edema with midline shift from right sided gliomatosis cerebri.
After surgery, he had significant facial edema, but his mental status and level of consciousness were back to his baseline.
Decadron will be continued during XRT because of risk of increased swelling.
Exam on discharge: awake, alert, fluent, some disinhibition, mild inattention (digit span forwards [**5-18**]), no neglect, mild left hemiparesis (delt at least antigravity, provides resistence in other UMN muscle groups).
He was started on Zyprexa to help with agitation which is likely secondary to decadron and frontal lobe location of the tumor.
2.LLL pneumonia: The patient was found to have a LLL pneumonia on CXR on admission.
His initial fever also resolved on antibiotics.
No other source of infection was found and blood cultures were negative.
He should wear the helmet provided for him when out of bed (really at all times if pt may get out of bed without warning given his mental status).
Haloperidol 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for agitation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: -gliomatosis cerebri -s/p right hemicraniectomy -left lower lobe pneumonia - Hep A/B/C   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Neurologic examination notable for left facial droop, mild left hemiparesis.
If you experience worsening weakness, numbness, speech or visual difficulties, or other concerning symptoms, please return to the emergency department for evaluation.
