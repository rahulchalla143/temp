History of Present Illness: 74 year old female with history of endometrial cancer status post TAHBSO and brachytherapy who began having shortness of breath in [**Month (only) 116**].
At the same time the patient began having back pain as well as a pleuritic-type pain in her "left lung".
Patient had an abnormal chest xray which led to a CT scan that revealed 2.2 x 1.7 cm left upper lobe mass, several areas of right pleural density adjacent to RUL and RLL with the largest being at the lower lobe posterolaterally measuring 3 x 1.4 cm and a moderate left pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis.
She had a bronchoscopy at an OSH where there were no endobronchial lesions and the lesion in the LUL was biopsied (no malignant cells).
PET scan revealed FDG uptake within multiple pleural deposits as well as the slips of the diaphragm and retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
Past Medical History: NIDDM HTN Hyperlipidemia Asthma Status post cholecystectomy Endometrial cancer, status post TAHBSO, brachytherapy   Social History: Married.

Patient    [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    74 year old woman with pleural effusion, LUL lung nodules and multiple pleural    based nodules REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    evaluate for malignancy/LAD.
INDICATION: Pleural effusion, left upper lobe lung nodules and multiple pleural-based nodules.
Please evaluate for malignancy and lymphadenopathy.
FINDINGS: There are bilateral pleural effusions, moderate to large on the left, and small on the right.
Within the left pleural fluid, there are heterogeneous areas of increased density, suspicious for pleural nodules.
Several discrete pleural or pleural-based nodules marginate the left mediastinal pleura including 1.9 cm nodule (2, 25), 2.9 cm nodule (2, 28), and 2.1-cm nodule (2, 30).
The right pleural effusion is homogeneous, and relatively low in density (4 [**Doctor Last Name **]).
No definite nodularity is seen in the right pleural effusion, though there is a serous density, 1.8 cm pleural-based nodule higher in the right hemithorax, located along the lateral right pleural surface (2, 20), and a 3.5 x 1.7-cm anterior, softtissue nodule (2, 44) difficult to differentiate between a very inferior pleural nodule and a subdiaphragmatic nodule.
Several scattered parenchymal nodules in the right upper lobe measure up to 5 mm (2, 25).
Fissural nodularity between the right upper and lower lobes at the same level is 1.3 cm long.
Atelectasis at the lung bases bilaterally, left greater than right, is likely related to passive compression from adjacent pleural effusion.
There is no pericardial effusion, or pericardial nodule.
There is mild atherosclerotic calcification of the coronary arteries.
This study is not specifically tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
Note is made however of moderate right hydronephrosis, which is incompletely imaged.
Several small subphrenic lymph nodes are noted on the right (2, 41), and there are scattered retrocrural and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, none of which meet CT size criteria for pathologic enlargement.
There is no osseous lesion suspicious for malignancy.
Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion with irregular areas of high attenuation nodularity is concerning for pleural metastatic disease.
Additional areas of nodularity adjacent to the left mediastinal pleura, and in the right upper lobe are also worrisome for malignancy.
Small right pleural effusion without discrete nodularity, homogeneously low in attenuation.
At least one nodular peritoneal implant seen in the right upper abdomen, also worrisome for metastatic disease.
CXR [**5-31**] The bilateral pleural effusion is present, left more than right, moderate to large on the left and small to moderate on the right.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
No overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 yo f with stage IV endometrial cancer, who was admitted for procedure.
She had a Chest CT that revealed a left pleural effusion with areas concerning for malignancy in the lungs and the abdomen.
The bx of the pleural showed malignancy as well as the plural fluid.
That night patient developed hypotension with BP down to 60 systolic tx with IVF 2 liters with improvement Creatine climbing on admission 1.1 up to 1.9.
Pain controlled with 1 gram of Tylenol q 6 hours.
Chest x/ray with out changes.
28-30 o2 requirement increased.
Right lower extremity appeared more edematous Duplex lower ext showed no DVT.
Attempt was made to diuresis pt with Lasix IV and then gtt, but respiratory distress and tachypnea continued.
She was evaluated by IP and not a able to have a pleuradex cath due to body habitus.
Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10084**] if experience: Fever > 101 or chills.
Increased shortness of breath, cough or sputum production.
