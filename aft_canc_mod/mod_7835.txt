Post-polypectomy site at cecum with stigmata of recent hemorrhage.
Post-Procedure Diagnosis - Post-polypectomy bleed No specimen collected   Brief Hospital Course: Hospital course: 52-year-old female with history of ITP and multiple recent polypectomies on [**12-14**] and [**12-19**], admitted with BRBPR and transferred to MICU for continued BRBPR and Hgb drop to ~ 9.
Colonoscopy performed showing post-polypectomy site at cecum with stigmata of recent hemorrhage with two endoclips applied for purpose of hemostasis.
# GI bleed: Patient presented with two episodes of hematochezia with subsequent Hgb drop to ~ 9 likely due to polypectomy site bleeding complicated by primary hemostasis deficit given underlying ITP.
Patient was hemodynamically stable although slightly tachycardic at times.
Patient transfused 4 units of pRBC with Hgb elevation appropriately to ~ 12.
Her HCT remained stable at time of discharge, ambulating without symptoms and no sign of ongoing bleeding.
# ITP Patient likely experienced acute manifestation of underlying ITP given thrombocytopenia.
Peripheral smear reviewed by hematology consultants consistent with ITP with no signs of hemolysis seen.
Patient had been unresponsive to platelet transfusions in past.
# Invasive adenocarcinoma: Patient noted to have adenocarcinoma from recent polyp biopsy.
