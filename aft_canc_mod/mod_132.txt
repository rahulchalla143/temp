Admission Date:  [**2145-12-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2145-12-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2075-9-16**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 139**] Firm  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70-year-old man with history of recurrent transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, anemia and questionable celiac sprue who presented with weakness and pallor of [**1-31**] weeks duration, followed by decreased hematocrit and increased INR to the MICU.
In [**2145-8-30**] the patient had a high retrograde urethral catheter placed for BCG for recurrent transitional cell carcinoma in his right renal pelvis.
The day after each treatment, the patient noticed rust colored urine and frank blood in his urine for the subsequent 3-4 days.
Three to four weeks prior to admission, the patient has had progressively worsening weakness and pallor.
Concurrently, the patient had repeated episodes of diarrhea and lost approximately 16 lbs in two weeks.
Shortly afterwards, he began experiencing constipation and noticed that his stools were black.
Since the patient thought his oral iron therapy might be contributing this blackened stools, approximately two weeks prior to this admission he stopped taking oral iron that had been prescribed for his chronic iron deficiency anemia.
The patient's fatigue persisted and worsened progressively in the week prior to admission; he was unable to climb up a flight of stairs due to exhaustion and difficulty breathing.
Associated symptoms included dizziness upon standing, increased bruising of his extremities, and pallor of his face and extremities.
The patient has had no prior personal or family history of a bleeding diathesis.
On admission, the patient's wife found him lying on the ground because of exhaustion and lightheadedness with facial pallor.
Lower extremity dopplers did not show evidence of DVT or evidence of intravascular bleed.
Abdominal and pelvis CT showed no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed, no evidence of hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid.
Additionally, the patient complained of left leg soreness and progressive weakness since his catheter placement in [**2145-8-30**].
The pain is located predominantly along the lateral aspect of his left lower leg distal to his knee; the pain is aggravated by movement and the weakness makes it difficult for him to walk.
He does not feel any numbness or paresthesias in his legs.
In the week prior to admission, he developed swelling distal to his knee which continued to persist.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder diagnosed in [**2136**], treated with cystoscopy and tumor resection in [**2136**], BCG in [**2137**] times two courses, Interferon in [**2137**], Mutamycin [**2139**].
In [**2140**], transitional cell carcinoma found in right renal pelvis, treated with intrapelvic alpha Interferon and BCG.
2) Disseminated BCG infection in [**2140**] treated with Rifampin and Ciprofloxacin.
The patient has had no colonoscopy in the last 10 years.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for fatigue, dizziness, recent weight loss, negative for nitrites or diplopia.
General, alert and oriented, in no apparent distress.
Skin, multiple ecchymoses on left lower extremity and left arm.
HEENT:  Anicteric sclera, supple neck, no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular, S1 and S2, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities, pitting edema in the left leg, no erythema or significantly increased warmth in left leg, mild pain on deep palpation of left lateral leg, right lower extremity without any edema.
No calf tenderness bilaterally.
Small bowel follow through also did not show any source of active bleeding.
The duodenal folds were atrophic with lack of villi, edematous, consistent with celiac sprue.
There were grade 2 internal hemorrhoids in the colon and polyp in the transverse colon which was removed.
Small bowel follow through was consistent with celiac disease.
Heme:  The patient had MRI of his lower extremities which showed chronic/subacute DVT in the right lower extremity that had partially recanalized.
Additionally, the hematology team did not think that patient had a coagulopathy because of rapid correction of his INR with just one unit of FFP.
It seems likely that his elevated INR was likely secondary to Vitamin K deficiency which was secondary to his celiac disease.
The patient's iron deficiency anemia is also likely secondary to his celiac disease.
Anti parietal antibodies were sent for ruling out pernicious anemia.
Musculoskeletal:  The patient's persistent left lower extremity edema and tenderness would be secondary to neuropathic vein which may have resulted from prolonged positioning of his left lower extremity during placement of his nephrostomy tube.
The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding further management of his transitional cell carcinoma.
Anemia, likely secondary to iron deficiency.
