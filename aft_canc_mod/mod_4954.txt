Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated three vessel disease.
The LAD had an 80% calcified mid LAD stenosis with 100% distal occlusion.
There was an occluded small OMB2.
The RCA had a 60% diffuse stenosis which was calcified and leading to a PDA.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated left sided filling pressures with mean PCWP 21 mmHg.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with PASP of 42 mmHg.
There was moderate aortic stenosis with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.19 cm2 (based on an assumed VO2).
Severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Moderate aortic stenosis.
Moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
Mildly elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
A more severe [**Country **] stenosis cannot be excluded due to the presence of calcifiedplaque.
Right verterbral artery appears occluded.
L vertebral open.
SPIROMETRY: Impression: Severe obstructive ventilatory defect with a moderate gas exchange defect.
There are no prior studies available for comparison.
TEE: IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate thickened aortic valve with significant aortic stenosis present (though not quantified).
ACTIVE ISSUES .
# CORONARIES: The patient presented with acute onset dyspnea and was found to have an NSTEMI with elevated CE's.
He was not originally started on heparin or plavix given GIB (see below) and was trasnfused 1U pRBCs to minimize cardiac demand ischemia.
His valvular disease was not significant enough to warrant mitral and aortic valve replacements, but should be monitored.
# PUMP: On admission, he appeared euvolemic without evidence of volume overload.
An ECHO on [**3-26**] showed 3+ MR and severe aortic stenosis with depressed EF35%.
However after medical treatment and diuresis, a repeat ECHO showed 2+ MR and a TEE confirmed these findings.
He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] as an outpatient for repeat TTE and management of his heart failure with the likely initiation of diuretic therapy.
Likely lower source, diverticulosis vs polyp vs AVM.
He was made NPO and underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy on [**3-27**] which showed a polyp and bleeding hemorroids.
His polyp was not removed given the bleeding risk and recent MI and should be followed as an outpatient with GI for this issue.
# Community-acquired pneumonia: The patient reported cough and shortness of breath for the past 2-3 weeks, and underwent CTA at OSH which showed evidence of b/l PNA, and was given a dose of Levofloxacin.
He denied fevers and b/l lower lobe opacities are more likely CHF exacerbation in the setting of NSTEMI given infiltrates are bilateral and patient is not an aspiration risk.
However, given his elevated white count of 21.9, which may be all or partially due to his NSTEMI and GI bleed, his Levofloxacin was continued for 5 days.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES .
# Health screening:  He will likely need routine health maintenance, most notably a colonoscopy, especially given his GI bleeding and anemia.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check chem-7 on Friday [**4-6**] with results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11767**]   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Non ST Elevation myocardial infarction Aortic Stenosis, valve area 1.2 Moderate Mitral Valve Regurgitation Acute systolic congestive heart failure Acute Kidney Injury Lower GI Bleed Carotid Stenosis Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack and had a cardiac catheterization that revealed many blockages in your heart arteries.
You were also found to have blockages in the arteries in your neck that could lead to a stroke if these blockages worsen.
You had some bleeding from your rectum that appeared to be due to internal hemorrhoids but you absolutely need to have a colonoscopy to look at your whole colon to make sure there are no other areas of bleeding or polyps.
You also were found to have emphysema or COPD due to your smoking.
Your kidneys were not working well due to your heart problems but now have almost returned to [**Location 213**] function.
Your heart is weak after the heart attack and you had some fluid retention that was treated with diuretics.
We are not sending you home on diuretics now but you need to weigh yourself every day in the morning and call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] if your weight increases more than 3 pounds in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
STart taking Atorvastatin (Lipitor) to prevent further blockages in your arteries from cholesterol buildup 3.
Start taking metoprolol to prevent another heart attack and lower your heart rate 4.
