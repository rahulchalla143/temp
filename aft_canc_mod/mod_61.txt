No pneumothorax has developed.
Bilaterally, there remains some mild blunting of the lateral pleural sinuses seen to extend in the posterior pleural sinuses on the lateral view.
Crowded vasculature and obliteration of the left-sided diaphragmatic contour is consistent with previously made diagnosis of left lower lobe posterior segment atelectasis.
Also seen on the right base is a very thin plate atelectasis in the right middle lobe territory.
No other new abnormalities are identified.
When comparison is made with the preoperative PA and lateral chest views of [**2166-2-20**], the now increased heart shadow is consistent with postoperative pericardial changes and moderate degree of postoperative mediastinal widening.
Further followup to confirm resolution of atelectases and pleural erosions is recommended.
IMPRESSION: Regression of postoperative mediastinal and pulmonary changes.
No pneumothorax remaining.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.

There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Left axis deviation - consider inferior wall myocardial infarction, age undetermined.
Right bundle-branch block with precordial T wave inversions.
Q-T interval prolongation.
The QRS interval is wider and a right bundle-branch block pattern has developed.
In the first twenty four hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without complications.
Based on lab data he was found to be pre renal, no evidence of ATN and received intravenous fluids and allowed blood pressure to be increased due to baseline 150-180.
He did remain in the intensive care for extended days to monitor renal function.
