Admission Date:  [**2160-2-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-2-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2093-8-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**] Chief Complaint: Hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bronchoscopy x 3   History of Present Illness: 66 M with history of adenocarcinoma of unknown origin p/w hemoptysis.
He was recently hospitalized on [**8-18**] with nausea/vomitting fever found to have a pneumonia s/p treatment but also with lung/liver masses, s/p lung biopsy and referred to oncology and offered systemic chemotherapy in [**8-18**].
He notes an increasing productive cough for yellow sputum, initially blood tinged progressive over the week.
He otherwise has some mild wheezes per report, denies cp, although with R sided chest discomfort, nonpleuritic, nonreproducible,no clear [**Month/Day (3) 74384**], episode of vomitting 2 days ago, food particles no blood, no brbpr,diarrhea,constipation.
Affirms weight loss over the past few months, with some anorexia.
In the ED, VS 99 95 157/93 20 96Ra, CTA performed demonstrated no PE, but with large R sided lung mass .
L RCC s/p L nephrectomy (in [**Country 9819**]), arrived to US in [**2151**], with increasing mass in chest CT. PET scan [**2158**] with multiple foci of abnormal uptake in soft tissue densities seen in the right lung associated with subcarinal LAD consistent with metstatic disease, as well as uptake in a large mass involving the dome of the right lobe of the liver.
[**8-18**] presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with n/v A CAT scan of the torso on admission revealed the right lower lung mass now measuring 4.4 x 2.7 cm with extension to the right lower lobe bronchus, multiple surrounding satellite nodules and a right hilar lymphadenopathy.
In addition, there was a 7.6 cm low density lobulated liver lesion as well as a tiny low density lesion in the body of the pancreas, (felt to be insignificant on review with radiology).
RLL Biopsy revealed non-small-cell carcinoma consistent with adenocarcinoma.
These findings support the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.
-MRI of the abdomen reveals a large predominantly cystic mass in  the right lobe of the liver measuring approximately 7.1 x 11 cm x 8.3 cm.
There are two smaller adjacent lesions, whose appearance  is most consistent with abscess.
Renal cell metastasis seems unlikely based on the MR appearance.
Metastasis to T10 is described as well as metastasis to the right lower lobe of the lung.
There is note made of hernia of the large bowel through the anterior abdominal wall.
Past Medical History: Presumed renal cell carcinoma status post left nephrectomy in [**2147**] in [**Country 9819**].
Adenocarcinoma of Unknown origin to lung/liver ?
bone Possible Macroadenoma ventral abdominal hernia   Social History: Social History: The patient immigrated to the United States in [**2151**] as a refugee from [**Country 16160**].
Import/Exporter from [**Country 651**]   Family History: There are no known cancers in the family.
The patient does note that his father died of swelling in the throat  possibly related to either infection or cancer.
Physical Exam: VS: 99 97 20 68 130/79 97RA GEN: NAD, comfortable speaking in full sentences HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, nonicteric sclera, no LAD, no JVD, Dry MM, OP clear, CV: RRR no mrg CHEST: decreased BS R side, ?

No evidence of superimposed acute cardiopulmonary abnormality .
[**2-3**] CTA No PE in the main or segmental arteries.
Progression of disease with massive right sided lung masses, including large 9 x 5 cm mass with endobronchial component involving the RLL and RML bronchi, which may contribute to pt's hemoptysis.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2160-2-7**] 3:25 PM The multiple pulmonary masses of the right lung including the right upper lobe, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe appear relatively unchanged.
No new focal consolidative process is noted.
Unchanged multiple pulmonary masses of the right lung with no new consolidative process.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2160-2-8**] 1:33 PM FINDINGS: In comparison with earlier study of this date, the patient has taken a much better inspiration, which has resulted in some decrease in opacification of the right base.
The large masses persist.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2160-2-8**] 1:55 AM CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: CTA: There is no evidence of a pulmonary embolism in the main or the segmental pulmonary arteries.
The evaluation of subsegmental branches is limited due to collapse-consolidation as well as extensive tumor involvement of the right lower lobe.
There is minimal interval increase in the size of the multiple bilateral pulmonary metastases.
For example, there is a 41 x 32 mm pleural-based mass in the right upper lobe, previously 36 x 28 mm (image 33, series 9).
There is a 56 x 51 mm lesion in the right lower lobe, previously 52 x 48 mm (image 64, series 9).
There is interval increase in the collapse-consolidation in the right lower lobe.
There also is minimal interval increase in the multi-station mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
The tumor in the right lower lobe surrounds the right pulmonary artery, invading the adjacent bronchus intermedius and may spread endobronchially.
There are bronchial secretions present in the right lower lobe bronchus--it is difficult to distinguish endobroncheal secretions from tumor involvement.
There are multiple hepatic metastases which appear more cystic and larger when compared to the prior examination, and this may be related to treatment effect.
There is a 94 x 49 mm metastasis in the right lobe of the liver, previously 90 x 44 mm (image 119, series 9).
MUSCULOSKELETAL: The lytic lesion in the inferior aspect of T10 vertebral body is unchanged.
There is no significant loss of height of the vertebral body.
No definite evidence of a central or segmental pulmonary embolism; however, the possibility of subsegmental emboli cannot be excluded, especially in the right lower lobe due to extensive tumor involvement and atelectasis.
Minimal progression of metastatic disease with increase in the size of pulmonary metastases and mediastinal lymphadenopathy as described above.
There is interval increase in the collapse-consolidation in the right lower lobe.
There is progressive loss of volume in the right lower lobe, likely a combination of endobronchial extension and retention of bronchial secretions.
Interval increase in the size of hepatic metastases, which appear more cystic and may be related to treatment effects.
There is stable appearance to the metastatic lesion in the body of T10.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2160-2-8**] 12:09 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-7**], there is increasing opacification at the right base with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm.
This could reflect interval development of atelectasis, effusion, or pneumonia.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2160-2-11**] 8:31 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-8**], there is some increasing opacification at the right base that could represent atelectatic or change distal to one of the numerous metastatic nodules.
Some elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is seen with a configuration, raising the possibility of subpulmonic effusion.
BONE SCAN  [**2160-2-13**] INTERPRETATION: Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and posterior projections demonstrate increased uptake within the T10 vertebral body, slightly more than on [**2159-8-14**] corresponding to lytic metastasis on CT.
There is increased uptake within both knees (right greater than left) shoulders (right greater than left), unchanged, and secondary to degenerative disease as evidenced on radiographs.
The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer excretion.
T10 metastasis, no other lesions identified.
Degenerative disease in the shoulders and knees.
