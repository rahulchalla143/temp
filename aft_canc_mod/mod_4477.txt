Pathology: BMB [**6-28**]: DIAGNOSIS:      ATYPICAL LYMPHOID INFILTRATE CONSISTENT WITH LARGE CELL TRANSFORMATION OF CLL/SLL LEFT SHIFTED MYELOID PRECURSORS AND CIRCULATING BLASTS SEEN .
Note: An atypical lymphoid infiltrate, which by flow cytometry was comprised of B-cells coexpressing CD10 is seen.
This is consistent with large cell transformation ([**Doctor Last Name **] type).
While CD34, nTdT and CD117 are negative within the large cells, a population of CD34 expressing events are noted by flow cytometry.
In addition, myeloids appear left shifted (including rare circulating blasts) and dysplasia is noted.
Given the history of chemotherapy, this could be consistent with therapy related dysplastic changes.
Definitive diagnostic features of acute myeloid leukemia is not seen in the current marrow evaluation, which is limited by a sub-optimal aspirate.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION .
They exhibit mild anisopoikilocytosis including burr cells, stomatocytes, red cell fragments - occasional tear drop cell.
Rare pelgeroid forms and neutrophils with toxic granules and vacuoles can be seen.
Occasional large atypical lymphoid cells with high N:C ratio, dark blue cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli are present.
Differential count shows 13% neutrophils, 5% bands, 11% monocytes, 65% lymphocytes, 1% eosinophils, 2% basophils, 3% large atypical lymphoid cells.
Several dysplastic granulocytes are present.
Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate  for evaluation and consists of a 5 mm section of cortical and trabecular bone and periosteum.
There are large, atypical cells with vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleolus present.
CXR [**7-1**]: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Marked retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, which are increased in size and number from [**2120-4-30**], with additional bulky lymphadenopathy along the iliac chains and pelvic side walls bilaterally.
Multiple small hypodensities in the liver, which are incompletely characterized.
New areas of rarefaction and lucencies in T8, T9, and L5 vertebral bodies.
TTE [**7-4**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No clinically-significant valvular disease seen.
CXR [**7-5**]: IMPRESSION: No pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: # CLL with transformation to Large B cell lymphoma: [**Doctor Last Name 6261**] transformation was felt to be very likely due to aggressiveness of neutropenia, as well as worsening LAD and splenomegaly on CT. Other possibilities included viral infection or drug-induced bone marrow suppression.
Our heme-onc team performed a BM biopsy on [**7-2**], which showed atypical lymphoid infiltrate consistent with large cell transformation of CLL/SLL.
Pt started on [**Hospital1 **] [**2120-7-7**], which she tolerated well with no nausea.
She had tid tumor lysis labs for the first 2 days, then [**Hospital1 **], then qday.
# Fever: She had fevers to 102.5 on [**7-1**] and [**7-2**].
We treated empirically with cefepime on [**7-1**] and acyclovir given the presence of herpetic lesions on her left upper lip.
Blood cultures were sent, which returned no growth.
Urine cultures were sent, which showed no growth.
Viral and fungal assays were sent, which showed negative EBV and CMV .
A nasal swab for viral cultlures was contaminated but negative for AFB's.
She did well overnight and had no increased cough or fevers.
# Chronic Cough: Pt came in with cough that she described as worse over the past few weeks.
However, after further investigation it was found that she had a chronic cough with previous extensive evaluation, not responsive to inhalers, prilosec, cough suppressants.
At this time they suggested continuing treatment for her lymphoma as of primary concern and to try saline nasal spray, which she was started on.
# Transfusion reaction: On [**7-4**], pt was treated with an IVIG infusion in an attempt to help the cough in the setting of neutropenia.
During the transfusion she began coughing, became hypertensive, developed fevers and her O2 sats dropped to 60% on RA.
# Herpes on lip: Pt was started on Acyclovir on [**7-2**], and was continued with treatment until [**7-11**].
# Osteoporosis: held Fosamax since pt has been admitted.
Tylenol 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every six (6) hours  as needed for fever or pain.
