History of Present Illness: 68M last CHOP for T-Cell 2 weeks ago, LLE dvt, h/o melanoma and nephrolithiasis p/w fevers, joint aches, no localizing sx x 2 days.
Patient reports some subjective chills and dizziness, but no other symptoms.
He denies fevers, nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, headaches, neck pain, abdominal pain, chest pain and shortness of breath.
In the emergency department Labs were notable for leukocytosis.
Patient had a transient episode of hypotenstion to the 70s that responded with fluids to the 90s.
Past Medical History: Oncologic History: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 yo male who developed left inguinal swelling in [**5-17**] while in [**Country 4194**], where it was attributed to a  hernia.
He was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2132-9-7**] with worsening left groin swelling and pain related to worsening lymphadenopathy, abdominal pain and nausea.
Laboratory data remarkable for elevated LDH and significant eosinophilia (as high as 30%.)
CT imaging demonstrated bilateral basilar pulmonary nodules and significant lymphadenopathy involving the  retroperitoneal, pelvic, and left iliac chains.
The CT findings, along with elevated LDH, raised concern about a lymphoproliferative disorder.
SPEP revealed monoclonal gammopathy, which was comprised of IgG lambda and constituted 1600 mg/dl.
Flow cytometry revealed atypical lymphohistiocytic infiltrate highly suggestive of peripheral T-cell lymphoma NOS.
On histological examination, the lymph node architecture was completely effaced with a background of epithelioid histiocyte granulomatoid aggregates.
Intermingled was an atypical lymphoid population that stained positive for CD2, 3, and 5 with dual loss of CD4 and CD8 and loss CD7.
The combined morphologic and immunophenotypic picture was most consistent with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, NOS.
Question of history of histoplasmosis.
Right shoulder surgery for fracture and dislocation [**2129**].
Family History: Breast cancer in mother, throat cancer in father, and coronary artery disease in brothers.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
Neck Supple, No LAD, No thyromegaly.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
LUNGS: crackles right base ABDOMEN: NABS.
No HSM EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
chest midline in place c/d/i SKIN: No rashes/lesions, ecchymoses.
No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism.
Bilateral lower lobe consolidation, likely representing pneumonia, right more than left.
Diffuse nodular and patchy opacities throughout the lungs, especially in the middle lobes, consistent with infectious or inflammatory etiology.
Precarinal, left paratracheal and right hilar lymph nodes measuring about 1.2 cm in short axis.
Left renal cyst.
Left inguinal partially imaged cystic lesion, this may represent a lymphocele.
7. left seminal vesicle with minimal surrounding fat stranding which measures up to 3.6 x 2.7 cm.
Clinical correlation for acute pain is recommended.
Chest Ultrasound: IMPRESSION: Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
This is most likely an infective process and the differential includes an acute (bacterial) on chronic (atypical - for example, atypical mycobacterial) infection.
New small pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo M with T cell lymphoma (+ monoclonal gammopathy), recent LLE DVT (now on anticoagulation) presents with fevers/chills, arthralgias/myalgias, headaches and now diarrhea with epigastric pain and abnormal CXR.
Patient was hypotensive but responsive to fluids in the ED, called out of the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after uneventful overnight stay (spiked temp of 102.8).
By Wednesday, [**11-18**], patient's IVF were discontinued as he had a new oxygen requirement the weekend prior felt partially due to fluid overload.
Patient continued to spike temperatures through Thursday, [**11-19**] so Levofloxacin was added.
Upon initiation of Clindamycin, patient's fever curve decreased and resolved within two days.
Of note, Capnocytophaga is a gram negative rod organism found in canines which has been found to cause fulminant sepsis in asplenic patients.
Patient developed tachycardia, hypotension, oxygen requirement and low-grade temperatures on Saturday, [**11-15**].
CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism and CT abdomen/pelvis did not show interval change in lymphadenopathy suggestive of worsening disease.
Chest ultrasound showed that the patient's pulmonary effusions were trace/small and non-tappable.
Patient was continued on Levofloxacin with good effect and repeat CT chest showed interval improvement in bibasilar consolidations.
# Visual disturbances/hallucinations: Patient was started on Voriconazole for broad pulmonary infection coverage and the day after initiation, he complained of bright white spots and auras around black window frames, words etc.
As patient continued to have these visual changes, CT head was ordered which did not show any acute changes.
Neurology was consulted, who revealed a history of Ecstacy and other illicit drug use.
It was felt that Voriconazole and possible, IV Morphine was causing patient's visual changes.
# Insomnia: Patient had frequent difficulty sleeping.
Diarrhea: Given recent antibiotics use, chemotherapy and elevated white count, concern for C.Diff.
Patient was ordered for CDiff stool toxin assays which were negative and patent's diarrhea resolved.
T cell lymphoma: Patient received his fifth cycle of CHOP-14 on Tuesday, [**11-25**] after resolution of his infectious process.
