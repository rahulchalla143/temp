NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2122-12-30**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):  Urine ([**12-29**]): NGTD  Preliminary cytology:  Pleural fluid adenocarcinoma cells, pending more detailed analysis.
STUDIES: ECG ([**2122-12-28**]): Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Diffuse low voltage.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
CXR ([**12-28**]): Large left pleural effusion with left upper lobe collapse and left central adenopathy.
Left-sided mass is presumed.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Aggressive central left upper lobe lesion that invades the left pulmonary artery, superior left pulmonary vein and occlude the left upper pulmonary bronchus.
Extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Multiple pleural deposits.
Bone metastases and pathological fracture of the right eighth rib.
Tense left pleural effusion.
CXR ([**12-29**]): In comparison with the study of [**11-27**], the degree of opacification in the left hemithorax has increased.
However, this could relate to a redistribution of pleural fluid in the supine position, when compared to the upright PA view in the comparison study.
Nevertheless, there certainly does not appear to be any substantial reduction in the degree of pleural fluid.
No pneumothorax is seen.
CXR ([**12-29**]): Right basal atelectasis has nearly cleared and small right pleural effusion is stable.
Because of rightward patient rotation, it is hard to say whether there has been interval rightward mediastinal shift, but I believe there has been, suggesting an increase in the volume of the already large left pleural effusion that nearly completely collapses the left lung, and obscures extensive intrathoracic malignancy as seen on the torso CT earlier today.
Bleeding into the left pleural space is certainly possible.
No pneumothorax.
CXR ([**12-30**]): A modest decrease in the large left pleural effusion is reflected in a slight increase in the small region of apical lung aeration and return of the trachea to the midline.
Small to moderate right pleural effusion is larger.
No pneumothorax.
Extensive left pleural effusion, occupying approximately two-thirds of the left hemithorax, with displacement of the mediastinal and cardiac structures towards the right.
On the right, there is unchanged evidence of a small pleural effusion and an otherwise normal lung parenchyma.
No acute intracranial abnormality.
No evidence of metastatic disease.
Sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease, with chronic lacunar infarct in the left centrum semiovale.
Status post left pleural pigtail catheter placement with improvement in the volume of left pleural effusion and minimally improved aeration of the left lower lobe.
Left lower lobe bronchus shows short segment occlusion, likely reflective of a mucus plug.
Continued large left upper lobe mass with mass effect on the adjacent bronchus and artery; mediastinal lymphadenopathy, most prominent in the subcarinal stations.
New small consolidation in the anterior portion of the right lung apex may represent residual atelectasis versus a new focus of pneumonia; small right simple pleural effusion with minimal associated atelectasis.
CXR [**1-6**] Upright portable view of the chest demonstrates left lower lobe consolidation.
Diffuse opacification of the left hemithorax is not significantly changed since study obtained five hours prior.
The right lung is clear without pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Persistent left lower lobe consolidation and large left pleural effusion, unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient Summary: ============== 83 yo M with HTN, HL, hypothyroid and significant smoking history found to have a large left lung mass, as well as multiple bony lesions.
Admitted to the MICU with hypercoaguability and hypotension.
Active Issues: ============== # Malignancy Primary lung malignancy is most likely given large lung mass on CT. Also with significant smoking history.
Mets in R pelvis, rib and thoracic spine.
Given his advanced disease and poor functional status, no treatment options beyond palliative care were available.
Elected to undergo some palliative radiation of right pelvis.
# Hypotension Resolved.
Pt had hypotension upon arrival to ED w/ SBP nadir 79, very responsive to fluids.
Pt received 5-6L IVF w/in first 24 hours of hospital stay, complicated by pulmonary edema, worsening effusions and increased work of breathing (nasal cannula to 6L.
He was transferred to the medical oncology floor on [**12-31**], however had recurrent hypotension and was transferred back to MICU on [**1-1**].
# Supratherapeutic INR:  Question secondary to poor PO intake versus cirrhosis by CT abdomen.
# Atrial fib: Stopped metoprolol for CMO.
Stable Issues ============== # Anxiety/depression: continued citalopram .
