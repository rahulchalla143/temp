47 year old woman with w/spina bifida, MR, paraperesis, recent TEN ([**3-4**] Bactrim, ~ 20-30% of BSA) and seizure disorder (non-epileptic and/or epileptic) who initially presented to the ED with RLE pain and swelling.
Reportedly she first noted the pain and swelling when she awoke on day of admission [**2177-8-13**].
Apparently the pain was greatest in ankle and calf, was described as sharp, up to [**10-10**], and worse with weight bearing.
No recent trauma, fevers, chills or night sweats.
It is unknown if she had taken any new or non-prescribed medications.
XRays showed DJD and soft tissue swelling but no fracture.
Significant pain was encountered on attempt to aspirate R ankle joint.
On the floor, she was normotensive and not tachycardic overnight.

Physical Exam: Gen: ill-appearing lady on supplemental O2, not oriented, groans to pain Vitals: 102.3F 115/58 99 14 99% on vent General: Somnolent, responds to vocal stimuli.
HEENT: normal skin, no meningismus, obese.
No desquamation.
Ext: Bilateral erythema in LEs, R >> L, TTP and indurated, with erythema spreading to RLQ and flank.
There is mild edema in R ankle.
There are no mucosal ulcers or loss of epithelium orally or vaginally.
Exam per dermatology resident at 2 am:  ill-appearing lady on supplemental O2, not oriented, groans to pain Skin Type V A complete cutaneous examination of the scalp, face, neck, eyelids, mouth, conjunctiva, chest, abdomen, back, bilateral arms, bilateral legs, buttocks, digits and nails reveals the following significant findings: -RLE edema w/ overlying deep erythema which extends up RLE and is more pronounced on R lateral thigh/buttock -similar erythematous rash extends up R lateral trunk, axilla and skin folds of neck--> becomes papillomatous-like plaques from excessive soft tissue and skin swelling, there is more violaceous skin changes along R axilla; pt groans to pain when lesions pressed firmly -L antecubital fossa w/ violaceous patch w/ appears c/w impending necrosis -sclera icteric -no palmar/plantar involvement -there are no bullae or vesicles, no desquamtion -lips and genitals wnls  Repeat dermatological exam:  Pt re-examined 2 hours later.
Rash now appears more violaceous/dusky on b/l axilla and forearms and more concerning for an early evolving TEN-picutre.
Still w/ no mucosal lesions.
While no clear inciting [**Doctor Last Name 360**] for TEN, pt does have [**Last Name (un) **] to PCN and meropenem can have some cross reactivity.
We will bx and send specimens for tissue cx and path.
No complications.
No evidence of subcutaneous air to suggest nec fasc.
bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy 3.
Pelvic lymphadenopathy, most prominent along the right external iliac chain measuring up to 1.1 cm in short axis diameter.
6. congenital spinal dysraphism in the lower lumbar and upper sacral regions, unchanged, with meningocele.
XRay ankle, right [**8-14**]: No definite fracture or dislocation.
Demineralization with degenerative disease.
If symptoms persist, recommend followup radiographs in 10 days.
LENI [**8-13**]:  IMPRESSION: No definite evidence of DVT in the right lower extremity.
Within these limitations, there is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

Given hypotension, fever and worsening mental status she was treated for sepsis.
w/ multiple cephalosporin allergies) for coverage of necrotizing fasciitis.
CT torso and leg were obtained, no evidence of necrotizing fasciitis was noted (see results).
Due to inability to stay still, and incrasing upper airway obstruction with sedation, she required intubation for line placement.
fasc., however on reevaluation by derm, rash appeared more violaceous and dusky and more concerning for evolving TEN, without mucosal lesions and no clear inciting [**Doctor Last Name 360**] for TEN (though actual history is unknown).
Skin bx as taken for tissue cx and path.
Given the fact that patient was being transferred to the trauma/burn unit, a fascial biopsy was deferred to the treating physician's at [**Hospital1 112**], as an incision at this time would compromise already impaired skin barried and would increase risk of further infection given likely a nonsterile transfer.
Given concern for cross-allergenic reactivity of merepenem and cephalosporins, the [**8-15**] am dose of meropenem as a possible inciting [**Doctor Last Name 360**] for TEN, was held.
