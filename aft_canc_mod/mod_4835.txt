Pt developed constant, non-throbbing left sided headache about 2-3 weeks ago.
Revealed left parietal mass with large amount of surrounding edema 8mm midline shift and subfalcine herniation.
Pt developed urticaria to dilantin and she was given benadryl.
Past Medical History: Cholecystectomy hypercholesterolemia (recently diagnosed) anemia- ?

Minimal bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis at lung bases.
Small cyst in the left kidney.
Minimal degenerative changes in thoracolumbar spine.
MRI Head [**2-19**]: Ring-enhancing mass in the left parietal lobe, with both local mass effect and midline shift.
Differential considerations primarily include glioblastoma multiforme versus metastatic disease.
An area of T1 hyperintensity adjacent to the ring-enhancing structure may represent an area of hemorrhage or a second area of enhancement  CT Head [**2-22**]: Status post left craniotomy with moderate pneumocephalus and small amount of hemorrhage in the surgical bed.
Left parietal vasogenic edema surrounding the surgical bed.
Pneumocephalus places mass effect on the left cerebral hemisphere and 4-6mm rightward shift of midline structures.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] [**2-22**]: Postoperative changes status post resection of a left parietal lobe mass, with a tiny focus of possible enhancement along the inferior margin, which could represent a tiny focus of residual disease versus artifact related to volume averaging.
Unchanged blood products and edema surrounding the surgical cavity.
No evidence of new sites of hemorrhage, hydrocephalus or transtentorial herniation  CT Head [**2102-2-28**]: 1.
Decrease of density of blood products and pneumocephalus at the surgical cavity.
Unchanged vasogenic edema surrounding the surgical cavity causing unchanged 4-mm shift of midline structures to the right.
No evidence of new acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarction   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the Neurosurgery service floor status for Q 4 neuro checks and for further work up of the identified brain lesion.
