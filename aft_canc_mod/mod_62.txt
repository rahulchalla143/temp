Admission Date:  [**2174-9-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2174-10-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2097-4-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: Pericardial effusion, atrial fibrillation with RVR.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 1924**] is a 77-year old male with minimal prior medical care for over 50 years, with no known past medical problems, who was brought to the [**Name (NI) **] this morning by his social worker because he was noted to have labored breathing.
He minimizes his symptoms, and reports that he has been feeling "great" and has no complaints.
Her main concern has been with his balance.
He denies any prodromal symptoms with this fall including no lightheadedness, LOC, chest pain, SOB, and palpitations.
His social worker also notes that he has had decreased appetite with minimal PO intake for the last few days.
She notes that on her visit today, he looked pale and had difficulty breathing.
He denies difficulty breathing and other complaints including no chest pain, palpitations, SOB, orthopnea, LE edema and PND.
In the ED he was noted to have atrial fibrillation to 140-160s with SBP 145/65.
He was given 5 mg IV diltiazem without response and started on a diltiazem gtt.
He had a formal echocardiogram that showed a moderate pericardial effusion (2cm) and no evidence of tamponade, though limited by suboptimal study due to RVR.
He is being admitted to the CCU with atrial fibrillation with difficult to control RVR on diltiazem 15 mg/hour.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: # Cataracts s/p surgery bilaterally # Right sided hearing loss, saw an ENT who recommended head imaging, which he has refused thus far.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: - Diabetes - Dyslipidemia - Hypertension  Social History: Social history is significant for 7 cigarettes per day x several years in his teenage years; he used to drink 2 cans of beer per day x 5 years in his 20s-30s, denies illicit drugs.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.

Bibasilar crackles, no wheezing and rhonchi.
Abd: Soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
PHYSICAL EXAM AT DISHARGE: Patient was in atrial fibrillation with rate of 90-100s.
He remained asymptomatic with O2 sats in the mid 90s, in no apparent distress, respiratory or otherwise.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM AT ADMISSION: EKG demonstrated atrial fibrillation at 162 with normal axis, no LVH by voltage criteria, normal intervals, no ischemic changes.
.. RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES: .
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**2174-9-29**]): There is diffuse symmetric enlargement of the ventricles and sulci consistent with mild-to-moderate age-related atrophy.
There is no evidence for hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or large vascular territory infarct.
There is a small heterogeneous lucency within the left parieto-occipital calvarium (2:24).
IMPRESSION: No evidence for hemorrhage or other acute intracranial process.
CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**2174-9-29**]): There is asymmetric interstitial septal thickening with some nodularity involving the entire right lung.
Multiple pulmonary nodules in the lungs are also identified measuring 8 mm (series 4:100).
There is bilateral atelectasis and moderate simple fluid-attenuating effusions.
There are multiple mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes measuring up to 12 mm(precarinal, series 4, image 96).
Although evaluation is limited without contrast, there is increased soft tissue in the right hilum concerning for adenopathy such as increased soft tissue posterior to the right main bronchus (series 4:125).
Calcified mediastinal and small right hilar nodes also noted.
No left hilar adenopathy is identified.
There are coronary artery calcifications.
Study was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, but no abnormalities are identified.
No suspicious lesions are identified in the osseous structures, which otherwise demonstrate diffuse degenerative changes.
Constellation of findings including asymmetric nodular right lung interstitial septal thickening, mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy, and multiple pulmonary nodules are concerning for possible malignant disease, but no definite primary tumor site is identified.
Consider PET CT for further assessment, if warranted clinically.
Large pericardial effusion.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
LV systolic function appears borderline depressed (difficult to assess to very rapid and irregular pulse).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
IMPRESSION: Moderate circumfirential pericardial effusion without tamponade.
LV/RV systolic function are preserved (difficult to assess due to irregular and very rapid pulse) .. ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2174-9-29**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion is most prominent posterior to the left ventricle, with <1 cm anterior to the right ventricle in diastole.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Dilated thoracic aorta.
Moderate pericardial effusion.
Aortic regurgitation is slightly more prominent, also likely secondary to longer diastolic period.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary, this is a 77-year old gentleman with no prior medical history who presents with a pericardial effusion and atrial fibrillation with RVR.
He was started on a diltiazem drip and admitted to the CCU for closer monitoring given his rapid ventricular rate.
.. # PERICARDIAL EFFUSION:  On echocardiogram, he was found to have a moderate-sized effusion (2 cm).
A repeat echo showed little interval progression.
After evaluation of echo findings and symptoms, we felt that the effusion was not affecting hemodynamics in any marked way.
By symptoms he was never hypotensive or showing clinical signs of tamponade.
The full CT report is above; in brief, it showed interstitial septal thickening, as well as mediastinal LAD and pulmonary nodules, all highly concerning for malignancy (primary site not identified).
Thus the pericardial effusion was felt to be due to metastatic cancer.
We discussed the findings with Mr. [**Known lastname 1924**] and explained to him that further work-up to diagnose and potentially treat his condition would involve tissue biospy and additional imaging.
.. # CAD/ISCHMIA:  We did not suspect ischemic disease as he had no risk factors, symptoms or EKG changes to suggest ACS.
Furthermore, echocardiogram did not show any focal hypokinesis or akinesis to suggest myocardial infarction.
.. # PUMP:  There were so signs of fluid overload or clinical pump failure on physical exam.
.. # RHYTHM:  He presented with atrial fibrillation with RVR that required a diltiazem drip in the emergency room.
We started him on PO metoprolol and diltiazem; however, he continued to have periods of AF with ventricular response to 90-110s while lying in bed.
We discussed starting anticoagulation, but felt that it was unnecessary and potentially harmful in this patient with a CHADS-2 score of 1 (age), potential medical non-compliance (history of homelessness), and significant fall risk (history of multiple mechanical falls in recent weeks).
.. # HISTORY OF FALLS:  History as above seemed most consistent with mechanical falls due to balance and gait problems.
[**Name (NI) **] loss of consciousness or cardiac prodromal symptoms to suggest arrhythmic cause, although certainly AF could be contributing to his generalized weakness and propensity to fall.
Neurologic exam was nonfocal and CT was negative for acute process.
# LOW-GRADE FEVERS / PULMONARY INFILTRATE ON CXR:  He had persistent fevers overnight with Tm of 101.6.
Chest CT showed no infiltrate but did show diffuse nodules and adenopathy concerning for malignancy.
Blood and urine cultures were negative and there were no localizing symptoms.
White count was WNL with no bands on the differential.
No source for his fevers was found, and he was not started on antibiotics.
Further work-up would require tissue sample of his pericardial effusion or mediastinal lymph nodes.
At time of discharge, he had remained afebrile for over 24 hours.
.. # RENAL FAILURE:  Urine electrolyes were consistent with prerenal azotemia.
There were no further concerns.
His anemia is likely secondary to marrow suppression from his underlying process, most likely a malignancy.
.. # GOALS OF CARE:  These were discussed with Mr. [**Known lastname 1924**] when his underlying disease remained uncertain.
We explained that we would need a tissue sample to definitively diagnose the cause for his pericardial effusion and bilateral pleural effusions.
We explained that this would likely provide an explanation for his presenting symptoms, namely his shortness of breath and anemia.
However, it was clear that Mr. [**Known lastname 1924**] wanted to return to his home and was not interested in any invasive procedures, even if these might reveal a potentially treatable cause for his symptoms.
