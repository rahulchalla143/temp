[**2119-2-12**] KNEE XRAY: Markedly limited examination.
The patella is markedly low with no definite fracture.
Small globular calcification is evident in the suprapatellar space which in theory may represent an avulsed enthesophyte.
Correlate with clinical suspicion for quadriceps rupture which should be relatively clinically evident.
[**2119-2-16**] CT HEAD:  8mm hyperdensity in the left cerebellar hemisphere is concerning for an intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Extensive chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
If there is a strong clinical concern for an acute infarct, a MRI should be obtained.
[**2119-2-16**] MR BRAIN/HEAD: No evidence of an acute infarct.
Small hemorrhage in the left cerebellar hemisphere measuring approximately 8 mm.
Additional history provided by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] indicates that the patient has had a hemorrhage in this location in [**Month (only) 956**].
Brief Hospital Course: 79 year old male with a recent cerebellar stroke and multi-infarct dementia, who presents with hypoxia, found to have an aspiration pneumonia.
He was evaluated by the speech and swallow evaluation team, who recommended pureed solids and thin liquids, along with supervised feedings.
2) Subacute cerebellar CVA: Given altered mental status, the patient underwent a head MRI, which showed a subacute 8 mm left cerebellar hemorrhage, likely representing known [**Month (only) 956**] event.
5) Gout: The patient was noted to have left knee pain/swelling.
An arthrocentesis was attempted without success due to poor positioning in the setting of left lower extremity contracture.
