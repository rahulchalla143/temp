Admission Date:  [**2158-9-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-9-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2076-5-17**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**] Chief Complaint: Right face, arm, and leg weakness and aphasia.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IV TPA  History of Present Illness: The patient is an 84 year old man with atrial fibrillation, not currently on coumadin, who was in his usual state of health until early in [**Month (only) 216**] of this year.
At that time, he began to experience worsening urinary retention, was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**], and was switched from avodart and finasteride to flomax.
On [**8-25**], the patient re-presented with the complaint of lightheadedness and dizziness; INR at that time was 2.9.
Neurology was consulted for these symptoms and felt that the patient?????
?s symptoms were likely due to his hyponatremia, CHF, and UTI.
He developed hematuria which was thought to be secondary to traumatic foley placement in the setting of his enlarged prostate.
At 6pm this evening, the patient was speaking with two of his family members at Rehab when he developed the acute onset of ??????confusion??????
and right-sided weakness.
EMS found the patient to be normotensive at 136/74 and in afib; they noted right face, arm, and leg weakness and an aphasia.
NIHSS at 7:05pm = 10 LOC 0 Questions 2 Commands 0 Gaze 0 Visual Fields 1 (R inferior quantrantanopia versus R hemianopia on confrontational testing) Face 1 (mild R facial droop) Motor 4 (2 points for R arm, and 2 points for R leg) Ataxia 0 Sensory 0 Language 1 (Difficulty with [**Location (un) 1131**], dysfluency) Dysarthria 1 Neglect 0  At the time of this initial neurologic examination, a careful screening for TPA exclusion criteria was carried out with the patient and his son.
?s recent hematuria was noted to constitute a relative contraindication; however, the patient had no absolute contraindications to receipt of IV TPA.
Rectal bleeding secondary to diverticulosis ( more than 5 years ago) Gout.
Social History: No tobacco.
Family History: Brother died at age 72 of heart failure.
No familial cancers.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: Irregularly irregular Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
S [**Doctor First Name **]: no rashes or lesions noted.
Able to follow commands, but shows some signs of perseveration.
Has difficulty identifying R and L, pointing instead.
III, IV, VI: Slight decrease in R lateral gaze.
Right sided pronator drift.
No adventitious movements, such as tremor, noted.
No asterixis noted.
-Coordination: No intention tremor, no dysdiadochokinesia noted.
No dysmetria on FNF or HKS bilaterally.
Pertinent Results: CT/CTA/CTP  Extensive small vessel ischemic changes are seen in the subcortical and periventricular white matter.
Additionally, there is a subtle hypodensity in the left frontal lobe concerning for acute ischemia.
There is no evidence for acute hemorrhage.
Source images and MIP images of the CTA demonstrates a hypoplastic left vertebral artery.
No hemodynamically significant stenosis is seen in the carotid arteries.
There is extensive cavernous carotid calcification.
No occlusion in the intracranial vasculature is seen nor is there hemodynamically significant stenosis.
CTP images demonstrate no large areas of asymmetric perfusion.
Extensive calcification is noted in the left carotid bifurcation in the neck as well as in the aortic arch.
On the MIP images, no hemodynamically significant stenosis is seen in the carotid bifurcations.
MRI brain: Acute infarct in the left ACA territory.
there is a small area of hemorrhagic conversion of the left ACA infarct  Echocardiogram (ordered)   Brief Hospital Course: Patient is an 82-year-old male admitted on [**2158-9-2**] for aphasia and right-sided weakness.
He has a history of atrial fibrillation, was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for lightheadedness and hyponatremia, and was taken off Coumadin due to hematuria, was recently diagnosed with metastatic spread of prostate cancer to his pelvic rami, ribs, and paraortic lymph nodes.
Patient was found to have acute onset of right-sided weakness and "confusion" by family, and had NIHSS of 10.
CT head, CTA head/neck, and CTP did not reveal any acute process.
Hospital course by problem:  1) Neurology; Patient had initial negative imaging as described above but given his acute onset of deficits, was given IV TPA and admitted to the NeuroICU.
An MRI brain confirmed a left ACA acute infarct and repeat CT head showed a small area of hemorrhagic conversion.
It was thought that his stroke was cardioembolic due to his history of atrial fibrillation off anticoagulation.
It is thought he may have diastolic dysfunction.
In addition, the patient's heart rate was noted to be intermittantly elevated secondary to rapid ventricular response from atrial fibrillation.
3) Fluid/Electrolytes/Nutrition: Patient presented with hyponatremia with a sodium of 126.
It was thought this may have been due to CHF or SIADH.
8) MICU Transfer: On the evening of [**9-7**], Mr [**Known lastname **] experienced an episode of hypotension with blood pressure in the 70s/50.
He was initially treated with fluid bolues with minimal response.
His CBC showed a significantly increased WBC 34.4 with no relevant changes in his chemistry.
There was concern the patient was septic and the medicine team was called; the patient was transferred to the MICU.
A Central line was placed and pt was started on pressors and broad coverage antibiotics.
Medications on Admission: Simvastatin 20 Metoprolol 100 [**Hospital1 **] Diltiazem 180 Lisinopril 5 Lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **]   Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Sepsis Left ACA stroke, likely cardioembolic Atrial fibrillation with RVR C.Difficile Hypertension Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Deceased   Completed by:[**2158-9-11**
