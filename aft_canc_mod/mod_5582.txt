There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
There are no pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax is seen.
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
ECG Study Date of [**2117-3-10**]  3:30:56 PM Atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response and a ventricular premature beat.
Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay.
Poor R wave progression.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2117-2-28**] no significant change.
Brief Hospital Course: 87M history of cardiomyopathy with both systolic/diastolic CHF (LVEF 50-55%), CKD Stage IV (baseline Cr 2.4-3) among other issues that presented to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath with no overt evidence of heart failure exacerbation in addition to hypothermia, acute on chronic renal failure with toxic-metabolic derangements, and hypotension in setting of hypovolemia.
#Hypotension/ Hypothermia, initially concerning for sepsis, but he was found to have no infectious source.
He has underlying hypothyroidism and likely disturbance in thermoregulation given elderly and underlying kidney dysfunction.
Hypothermia also concerning for sepsis, but patient has no obvious source of infection.
Patient's temperature has risen from 89 rectal to 95 rectal with passive re-warming and currently above 96 since [**3-12**] orally.
Patient was treated emperically with zosyn and vancomycin (1000mg given [**3-10**] 1900 and 1250mg given [**2117-3-12**] am) and his antibiotics were stopped on [**3-13**] as he had no signs of infection and a negative infectious workup including negative blood and urine cultures a CXR with evidence of pneumonia.
# Acute on chronic renal failure:  Patinet presented with a creatinine of 5.9 up from 3.2 on discharge 7 days ago.
He also had metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia on admission.
Renal also recommended sarna lotion for uremic itching.
# Chronic diastolic and systolic heart failure per prior notes, though an echo from [**2117-1-31**] showed an EF 50-55% with [**Hospital1 **]-atrial ennlargement, RV enlargement and severe TR.
He can resume torsemide on Monday [**3-15**] with close attention to his electrolytes and volume status.
# Atrial fibrillation/bradycardia Initially, patient likely with bradycardia secondary to hypothermia.
Rhythm is slow atrial fibrillation.
Metoprolol/digoxin were both held because of bradycardia.
**Both digoxin and metoprol held at discharge given concerns of bradycardia and hypotension with metoprolol, flucuating renal function in respect to digoxin (level 0.8 on admit) []Digoxin can be resumed per his PCP  # Hypothyroidism  continued on levothyroxine  # Myeloproliferative Disease His hydroxyurea was held in setting of ARF and was resumed on discharge.
He has been on this dose for a while  # Glaucoma continued latanoprost  #Goals of Care: Patient and family intersted in having more services provided at home.

Your discharge weight was 144.5  You were hospitalized for low blood pressure and low body temperature that have both improved.
You continue to require close attention to any symptoms of congestive heart failure including shortness of breath, leg swelling, difficulty breathing at night and kidney failure with less urination.
