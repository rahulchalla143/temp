During his chemoradiation course the pt has been experiencing mucositis and has had complaints of coughing and a sensation of choking with increased phlegm.
The pt has also endorsed an increased concentration in his urine.
On exam with cough productive with rhonchi at bases (per report), diaphoretic, foul appearing urine.

No ecchymoses.
No central or main pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
Right middle lobe pneumonia.
Multiple consistencies of barium were administered to the patient under constant video fluoroscopy.
ORAL PHASE: There is moderate reduction in oral phase, with tongue pumping and tongue weakness noted.
PHARYNGEAL PHASE: There is mild reduction in the elevation of the palate, with mild reduction in laryngeal valve closure and absent epiglottic deflection.
There was a large amount of residue within the vallecula after each swallow, with minimal clearing despite multiple swallows.
ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: Patient had an episode of laryngeal penetration with thin liquids.
No aspiration was seen.
=============== AP UPRIGHT CHEST: There has been little change since the most recent prior study with poorly defined right heart border with adjacent patchy opacity.
No new areas concerning for infection are identified, and there is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
There may be mild posterior blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
===============  ECHO Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with mild [1+] mitral regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no central or main pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
However, the timing of contrast bolus, as well as respiratory motion significantly limits evaluation of the more distal branches and pulmonary parenchyma.
There is central right middle lobe opacification with air bronchograms, consistent with pneumonic consolidation.
There is also left basilar atelectasis as well as opacification with mild mucoid impaction of the left lower lobe bronchi.
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
There is a pattern of diffuse osteopenia.
There is moderate degenerative change of the thoracic spine.
No central or main pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
Right middle lobe pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 75 year-old male with a Squamous Cell carcinoma of the Nasopharnx who presents with fever, shakes, productive cough, altered mental status.
# Right middle lobe pneumonia: Noted on admission chest CT. Bacterial versus aspiration pneumonia.
# Atrial fibrillation:  Mr. [**Known lastname 63015**] developed atrial fibrillation during his hospital course with rapid ventricular response.
His atrial fibrillation was attributed to his acute illness and recent radiation.
# Thrombocytopenia/Pancytopenia:  Patients platelet count was noted to trend down during his hospital course, and the rest of his blood lines also trended down.
Although this was felt likely due to his recent chemotherapy with carboplatin, his subcutaneous heparin was held and a HIT antibody was sent which was negative.
# Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Nasopharynx: Recently completed radiation course, chemo, changed from Cisplatin to Carboplatin.
# Mucositis:  Related to his recent chemo/radiation as above.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with fevers and altered mental status, found to have a pneumonia.
Your hospital course was complicated by development of atrial fibrillation, which was controlled with medication adjustments.
Please contact physician if develop fevers/chills, shortness of breath, chest pain/pressure, palpitations, any neurological symptoms (weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking), any other questions or concerns.
