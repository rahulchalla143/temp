He presented to [**Hospital3 5365**] where they obtained a CT torso showing extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli with suggestion of RV strain, and questionable gallbladder wall thickening.
He had an abdominal CT to evaluate extent of the lesion and was found to have incidental pulmonary embolus which was treated with lovenox then bridged to coumadin until [**5-/2168**] when it was discontinued per PCP.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed some GB wall thickening and possible hemangioma 1.7cm.
On the floor he confirms the above story and hx of prior PE, anticoagulation history and recent symptomatology.
Pt denied abd pain or fullness and reported that breathing was somewhat improved.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies cough or hemoptysis.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Diabetes Mellitus type 2 Psoriasis High grade dysplasia on colonoscopy s/p colectomy [**12/2167**]   Social History: Patient lives with his wife.
Physical Exam: Admission Physical Exam Vitals: t96.8  hr 110  bp 116/78  rr22  O296/3L NC General: Alert, oriented, male lying flat in bed no acute distress, speaking in full sentences HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: mild dry rales b/l bases, no wheezes or ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema  Discharge physical exam: Vitals: T 96  BP 121/80  HR 72  RR 18  SO2 94% RA Unchanged from above, except: General:  NAD, comfortable Lungs: CTAB  Pertinent Results: TTE ([**2168-8-20**]) The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild posterior leaflet systolic A late systolic jet of mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild mitral valve prolapse with mild mitral regurgitation  CXR ([**2168-8-19**]) FINDINGS: There are no old films available for comparison.
The lung volumes are slightly low.
There is a patchy area of volume loss at the left base which partially obscures the left hemidiaphragm that could represent small area of infiltrate versus volume loss.
There is no effusion.
In right lower extremity, occlusive thrombus extending from right calf veins to the common femoral vein at the level of the greater saphenous vein, though minimal surrounding flow is noted in the right popliteal vein.
Chronic partially occlusive thrombus within the left popliteal vein.
Mild gallbladder distention and gallbladder wall edema without stones or sludge.
These findings are nonspecific and may be related to third spacing or possible hepatitis.
Acute acalculous cholecystitis is considered unlikely, however, if clinical suspicion for acalculous cholecystitis is high, a HIDA scan may be obtained for further evaluation.
1.5 x 1.4 x 1.7 cm echogenic lesion in the right lobe of the liver, likely a hemangioma; however, due to patient's history of colon cancer, a metastatic lesion cannot be fully excluded.
MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2168-8-22**]):    No MRSA isolated.
# PE: OSH report suggests extensive thrombus b/l pulmonary arteries and each lobar branch with increased exertional dyspnea over past few days.
Evidence of intraventricular septum flattening on CT chest report and on FAST u/s in ED with RV dysfunction.
Chest xray showed low lung volumes, no consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.
He was switched from a heparin gtt to LMWH given normal renal fxn, body habitus and malignancy history.
# Liver lesion: Right upper quadrant ultrasound in ED showed some GB wall thickening and possible hemangioma 1.7cm with recommended f/u by MRI.
Previous MRI abd w/ w/out contrast at [**Location (un) 2274**] ([**2168-5-11**]) identified a 15 mm lesion in segment 8 consistent with hemangioma.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*1*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS pulmonary embolism  SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You presented to our emergency department with a known diagnosis of bilateral extensive pulmonary embolism.
This was diagnosed at at [**Hospital3 5365**], where you came earlier that morning with dyspnea and had a CT scan showing pulmonary embolism, a blood clot in your lungs.
We gave you extra oxygen to help you breath and enoxaparin to help dissolve your clot and prevent other clots from forming.
