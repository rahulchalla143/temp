History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 13013**] is a 56-year-old right-handed man with history of glioblastoma of the right temporal lobe, s/p resection [**2101-12-30**] followed by irradiation and temozolomide, VP shunt placement on [**2102-8-1**], and now on Procarbazine, CCNU, and Vincristine (PCV) since [**2102-8-23**].
He presented to the [**Hospital3 **] ED on [**2102-11-14**] with shortness of breath.
The patient states that his shortness of breath started 2 days prior to admission but worsened the day prior to admission so much that he could not move without becoming short of breath and even at rest was SOB.
He denies fevers or chills.
He reports a cough which started on the day of admission which is non-productive.
He has congestion and right ear fullness with decreased hearing, and has been using drops to break up the wax in his ear.
He reports 2 days of diarrhea last week after eating raw shellfish which as resolved.
He initially went to [**Hospital3 4107**] and underwent CTA which showed no pulmonary embolism but did show bilateral infiltrates concerning for pneumonia.
The informal read of the CTa was suspicious for pulmonary embolism.
Past Medical History: Past Oncological History: - [**12-21**] developed headaches and leg weakness and CT at [**Hospital1 **] showed right temporal lobe mass.
Underwent subtotal resection of the R temporal lobe mass by Papavassilious on [**2101-12-30**], path positive for GBM - received temozolamide chemo-radiation, followed by adjuvant temozolomide (4 cycles) - ventriculoperitoneal shunt placed [**2102-8-1**] - started Procarbazine, CCNU, and Vincristine (PCV) on [**2102-8-23**] - cycle 2 of PCV on [**2102-10-10**]  Other Past Medical History: None.
Family History: His father died of a myocardial infarction at age 60.

EXTREMITIES: wwp, no edema.
He has mild psychomotor slowing.
Motor Examination:  He does not have tremors while working on [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] eighth floor.
His muscle strengths are [**5-17**] at all muscle groups, except for proximal lower extremity weakness at 4+/5 strength on both side.
He does not have a Romberg.
No acute hemorrhage.
Large confluent hypodensity involving the right frontoparietal and temporal lobes with adjacent vasogenic edema.
Increased mass effect with compression of the adjacent right lateral ventricle with leftward shift has increased since prior study (MRI [**2102-10-2**]).
CT head [**2102-11-23**]: Technically limited study by patient motion, with no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
Large right cerebral hypodensity with associated mass effect is redemonstrated, with decreased right to left subfalcine shift, though increased mass effect and compression of the right lateral ventricle.
Echocardiogram [**2102-11-21**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with low normal global systolic function.
Mildly right ventricular dysfunction.
CXR [**2102-11-17**]: (upon admission):  Interval increase in the degree of the bilateral consolidations within the upper lobes and appearance of new consolidation in the right mid-lung concerning for progression of the pneumonia.
CXR [**2102-11-22**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase of the pre-existing opacities at the left lung base.
Otherwise, the distribution and severity of the pre-existing opacities is unchanged.

Unchanged low lung volumes with mild cardiomegaly, minimal overhydration and absence of larger pleural effusions.

[**2102-11-15**] Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture Respiratory Viral Culture-FINAL; Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen-NEG [**2102-11-15**] URINE Legionella Urinary Antigen -NEG  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 13013**] is a 56-year-old right-handed man with history of glioblastoma who initially presented with cough, shortness of breath, and bilateral infiltrates on CXR, treated for PCP pneumonia, and [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/p PEA arrest.
(1) PEA Arrest [**2102-11-23**]:  Flail chest resulted from CPR, pt continues to occasionally complain of pleuritic left sided chest pain.
(2) Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure:  Patient was admitted to the ICU with a very tenuous respiratory status.
However, patient had a PEA arrest requiring intubation on [**2102-11-23**].
Upon a trial of lowered sedation, it was noted that patient also had paradoxical respiration likely [**2-14**] rib fractures from the CPR on [**2102-11-23**].
It occurred after administration of oxycodone and after his family left and he became disoriented.
Delerium was likely secondary to opiate administration as well as disorientation and his underlying disease.
[**Month (only) 116**] also have some confusion secondary to steroid administration and underlying encephalopathy from PEA arrest.
(4) Subsegmental Pulmonary Embolism:  [**Hospital1 18**] radiology says clot is stable (initially found to have a subsegmental PE on CTA done to rule out causes of hypoxia).
Heparin drip was held briefly also because of pancytopenia (including dropping platelet counts).
However, it was restarted given the risk outweighs the benefit and stabilized anemia and platelets counts.
Lovenox dosage was reduced by 10% (90 mcg to 80 mcg q12H) due to continued hematuria after traumatic Foley insertion or self discontinuation of Foley catheter.
Urinalysis otherwise negative.
(6) Multiple Loose Stools:  Patient had flexiseal placed secondary to multiple watery stools.
Loperamide prescribed at time of discharge as needed for continued loose stools.
(7) Positive AFB on BAL:  Patient had positive AFB from BAL and was placed on respiratory isolation.
(8) SIADH:  Likely secondary to intracranial malignancy.
It was initially thought that he had a reset osmostat.
After the PEA arrest and cooling/rewarming protocol, patient's hyponatremia improved and resolved on continued free water restriction even prior to initiation of Lasix on [**2102-11-28**].
Hyponatremia resolved, Na 137 at time of discharge.
It was unclear whether it was medication induced, increased destruction or sequestration.
Possibly secondary to underlying infectious process as it is now trending up and still on Bactrim and other antiepileptic meds that can cause thrombocytopenia, however, underlying cause still unclear.
(11) Erythroderma:  After artic cooling patient developed diffuse erythroderma.
It was unclear whether this was secondary to medication or artic cooling because also happened in the setting of thrombocytopenia and petechiae.
Bactrim was not discontinued and rash now significantly improved, likely secondary to artic sun cooling, it began after use of the cooling pads and has since resolved with no changes in medications.
(12) Petechiae:  After the artic sun cooling it was noticed the patient had petechiae around the border of the cooling blankets.
It was unclear whether in the setting of the rash and thrombocytopenia this was related to bactrim treatment.
There was no evidence of DIC as hemolysis labs negative.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 13013**], You were admitted to [**Hospital1 **] for shortness of breath.
Also, you were noted to have blood clots in your lungs, so were started on blood thinners.
You also had a MRI of your brain and the preliminary report showed that the tumor is unchanged, but it is more dense.
