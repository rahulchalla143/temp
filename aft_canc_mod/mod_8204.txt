The assessment of the mediastinum demonstrates bulging of the aortopulmonic window that might be due to pericardial effusion or hematoma, attention to this area is recommended.
Patient has mild pulmonary edema.
[**7-28**] CXR: As compared to the prior study, there is interval improvement of the mediastinal appearance, most likely consistent with resolution of atelectasis.
Bilateral pleural effusions have slightly increased as well as bibasal atelectasis.
No pneumothorax is present.
[**8-2**] CTA: No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Bilateral pleural effusions, increased in size since [**7-19**], with overlying atelectasis; however, infectious process cannot be excluded, particularly in the right lower lobe.
Mild pulmonary edema.
Slightly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes since [**7-19**].
Calcified thyroid nodule in the right lobe.
There is marked interval improvement in bilateral upper zone pulmonary vascular re-distribution and patchy consolidation consistent with improvement in pulmonary edema.
Bilateral infrahilar and bibasilar opacities persist.
Probable small left pleural effusion.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
[**8-6**] ECHO: Very poor image quality.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo female with history of ER/PR positive breast DCIS s/p ex lap, resection of tumor, infragastric omentectomy, left hemicolectomy, end colostomy, BSO for advanced ovarian cancer, who was admitted to the ICU for post-procedure extubation and hypotension and another ICU admission for flash pulmonary edema.
#ICU admission #1 for hypotension, intubation, require intense monitoring immediately post-operation: 2 liters of ascitic fluid was drained upon opening of her abdomen, estimated blood loss for the surgery was 1 liter.
HCT were monitored and there was a slow decrease in her HCT but no evidence of active bleeding, she was given 2 additional units of PRBC.
# ICU admission #2/desaturation secondary to flash pulmonary edema: [**2159-8-2**] she had respiratory distress after CTA of the chest was performed for tachypnea and persistent tachycardia in the 100's.
CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed worsening bilateral pleural effusion with pulmonary edema.
Her Lung exam was significant for extensive inspiratory crackles, CXR consistent with worsening pulmonary edema.
Nebulizers were given with minimal improvement.
A small troponin leak was noted during her 2nd admission to the ICU.
Echo was of suboptimal image quality and showed ?
Repeat Echo on [**8-6**] confirmed prior Echo and showed moderately depressed LVEF at 30-35%.
Pt will follow up as outpatient with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 32255**] (cardiologist) [**2159-8-16**] for medication adjustment and possible outpatient perfusion imaging versus catheterization.
# Hypotension: she had large volume fluid shifts during surgery and hypovolemia due to blood loss.
There was low suspicion for sepsis or cardiogenic causes.
Her sedation and vasopressors were weaned without any difficulty, and her blood pressure remained normal at the time of transfer out of the ICU and continue to be stable prior to discharge to rehab.
# Hematocrit: Patient's hematocrit dropped from 39.9 on admission to 30.0 post-surgery.
She received aggressive fluid resuscitation due to hypotension (see above) and some component of her HCT drop is likely dilutional.
This was slowly weaned and she was extubated without complication.
# Advanced ovarian carcinoma: s/p ex lap with resection of tumor, infragastric omentectomy, left hemicolectomy, end colostomy, BSO, and optimally debulked.
#Incisional cellulitis/wound care: small 1.5 cm incisional opening, continue with twice daily wet to dry wound packing; mild erythema around the incision and wound opening, pt was started on a 10 day course of Keflex.
# UTI: urine culture was positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and it was pan-sensitive.
# post-op de-conditioning: pt was evaluated by the inpatient physical therapists and they recommended rehab care.
Chronic issues: # Hypertension: continued home med lisinopril, additional anti-HTN meds were added due to the heart failure ( Lasix 20 mg daily, Carvedilol 6.25 mg twice daily)  # Asthma: continued home meds fluticasone and nebs PRN  # Depression/anxiety: Continued home meds bupropion and sertraline  # Hypercholesterolemia: Continued home meds simvastatin   Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
Xopenex Neb *NF* 0.63 mg/3 mL Inhalation PRN SOB 6.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair, and some ambulation with assistance and walker.
