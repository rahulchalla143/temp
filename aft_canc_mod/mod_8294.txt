IMAGING: CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2146-8-26**] 1:45 PM There are lower lung volumes with worsened bibasilar opacities likely worsening atelectasis.
There is no  pneumothorax.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2146-8-25**] at 9:47:32 AM      FINAL  IMPRESSION: No vegetations or clinically-significant regurgitant valvular disease seen.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
New interval focus of hypodensity in the left basal ganglia, which is concerning for acute to subacute ischemia.
New subtle questionable hypodensity at the left cerebellum, concerning for acute ischemia in the appropriate clinical setting.
Additional consideration as a differential diagnosis could be a subtle mass giving a small focus area of vasogenic edema, which could also be evaluated further with brain MRI.
There is a possible large PICA distribution left cerebellar infarction.
CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2146-8-23**] 12:03 AM CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2146-8-23**] 12:03 AM OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Diffuse osteopenia is noted.
At L4-5, loss of disc height with irregular, sclerotic margins is consistent with prior discitis/osteomyelitis.
There is no new fracture or worrisome bony lesion.
Stable appearance of small bowel, without evidence of obstruction.
No new abnormalities in the abdomen or pelvis.
Brief Hospital Course: 47 yo woman with [**Location (un) **] syndrome, s/p colectomy with short-gut syndrome requiring TPN via indwelling tunnelled femoral hickman with recurrent line infections p/w abdominal pain, nausea, increased ostomy output, and recent fever c/w prior episodes of bacteremia and word finding difficulty.
Sepsis: Her presenting symptoms of abdominal pain, increased ostomy output, and nausea were consistent with prior presentations of bacteremia.
She was last admitted in early [**Month (only) **] with a methicillin-resistant coag-negative staph (MRSE) infection of a tunneled and a peripheral line.
Shortly afterward, she developed hypotension with SBP 80s in the setting of copious output into her ostomy bag.
Given her additional recent history of Malassezia bacteremia, she was started on fluconazole in addition to the daptomycin and cefepime.
When she arrived on the general medicine floor, her SBP was in the 80s and 90s with occasional tachycardia to the 100s or low 110s.
She was afebrile throughout her stay on the floor.
TEE was considered; however proceeding with TEE was thought to be of high risk given patient's difficulty tolerating EGD at an OSH.
Treatment was discussed with infectious disease physicians and their recommendations were to continue animicrobial treatment for 4-6 weeks or until infectious disease follow-up.
They recommended treatment with daptomycin given past bacterial infections and fluconazole for past fungal infections.
The Quad-lumen was removed on [**2146-8-31**] after a 4 day stay on the general medicine floor without need for pressor support.
Sub-Acute Stroke vs Septic Emboli: Word finding difficulty was noted by patient to be new over on the about 1 week prior to admission.
CT Head was performed and demonstrated areas of hypodensity in L basal ganglia and L cerebellum.
As described above, there was concern for endocarditis predisposing the patient to having septic emboli to the brain and resulting in these neurologic symptoms.
Given history of clots, there was also concern for thromboembolism.
Anemia: She was guaiac positive at her ostomy on [**2146-8-25**].
Medications on Admission: daptomycin 275mg iv q 24 hours (to complete 4 week course [**2146-8-26**]) plavix 75mg daily fentanyl 150mcg patch q72 ativan 0.5mg po q6 prn anxiety ethyl alcohol 98% 2ml inot catheter post tpn zofran 4mg q4 prn nausea  Discharge Medications: 1.

Disp:*20 doses* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Diversified VNA [**Location (un) 1157**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary DXs: #Sepsis, SIRS criteria by temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, and WBCs<4000 cells/mL in the setting of incomplete treatment for previously documented bacteremia and a high clinical suspicion for fungemia.
#Bacteremia (admitted during incomplete treatment of methicillin resistant coagulase negative staphylococcus) #Short gut Syndrome #Anemia (requiring transfusion for a symptomatic hematocrit of 19) #Chronic Pain Secondary DXs: #Hypercoagulability (previous pulmonary embolism) #[**Location (un) **] syndrome #Fibromyalgia (per EMR) #Osteoporosis #Scoliosis; h/o surgical repair #Spinal Stenosis   Discharge Condition: Stable.
You were admitted for abdominal pain, increased ostomy output, and word-finding difficulties.
Given your recent bacterial and fungal infections you were treated with antimicrobial medications.
As a result of low blood pressure in the context of suspected infection you were treated in the intensive care unit with continued antibiotics and medications to support your blood pressure.
Throughout your admission you were seen by neurology for word finding difficulties and new weakness.
Imaging of your head did not show lesions that would cause these abnormalities, however some nonspecific changes were seen in other areas.
There was no active process that was seen on imaging, but this imaging was limited by your iodine reaction preventing the use of contrast and the metal hardware in your body that prevent the use of MRI imaging.
Given concern for an infection of the heart predisposing you to having lesions in your brain and resulting in these neurologic symptoms we consulted with cardiology.
No evidence for infection was seen.
While this imaging modality is not usually the best test to evaluate for heart infections, there was concern about putting a sensor in your esophagus given past history of complaints of pain with eating.
The risk of the tests is substantially increased by the need for general anesthesia and is more tenuous when you are sick.
These medications will be written for 6 week prescriptions and they may be discontinued earlier after you have an appointment with infectious disease.
Please seek immediate medical attention if you have recurrent symptoms especially if you have a fever, are in dramatically worse pain, or have low blood pressure and a fast heart rate that doesn't respond to fluids.
You should call 911 if you have rapid onset neurologic changes such as sudden weakness or paralysis, sudden loss of vision, sudden loss of speech, or sudden dizziness.
Please seek medical attention if you have redness, pain, swelling, and abnormal warmth around the sites of your ostomy and femoral intravenous line given concern for infection.
