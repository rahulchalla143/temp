Pt notes headache localized to the top of the head and behind the eyes more pronounced on the left.
Pain incrased with eye movement particularly with left lateral gaze.
Denies loss of vision or visiual deficits however notes general blurriness to vision.
He denies any stiff neck, recent trauma,increased weakness of extremitites, new neurologic symptoms including new weakness/numbness, nausea, fevers/chills, cough.
He presented to OSH, where head CT was consistent with stable 1.7 X1.5 cm hyperdense sellar and suprasellar mass present .

Diabetes insipidus.
Growth hormone-secreting pituitary macroadenoma status post resection.
Superficial septic thrombophlebitis with bacteremia.
He has had some history of vaccination as in childhood with right arm deformity.
Family History: Patient is unaware of any history of diabetes or other endocrinopathies.
Pulm: No dullness to percussion, CTAB no crackles or wheezes Abd: BS+, soft, NT, no rebound/guarding, no HSM, no [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign Extremities: wwp, no edema.
Skin: no rashes or bruising Neuro: CNs II-XII intact.
Pain with eye movement to the left lateral side.
Imaging: [**5-21**] MRI: Evaluation of the sella reveals marked interval enlargement of the residual pituitary adenoma centered in the left sella, with suprasellar and left cavernous sinus extension.
The pituitary mass measures 2.6 CC x 1.8 AP x 1.7 TRV cm, with extension into the medial aspect of the left cavernous sinus, abutting the medial aspect of the cavernous left carotid, and surrounding approximately 270 degrees of the supraclinoid left carotid after it exits the cavernous sinus.
The left optic nerve is difficult to follow, but appears encased by the suprasellar and sellar portions of the mass in the prechiasmatic region.
The tumor insinuates between the prechiasmatic portions of the optic nerves with mild mass effect upon the right prechiasmatic optic nerve as well.
The left A1 segment is at least partially encased by the mass, and the mass displaces the A2 segment anteriorly and abuts these vessels.
Chronic post-operative changes are seen in the left subfrontal and pterional region from craniotomy with duraplasty.
However, there is no definite evidence of extension into the sphenoidal sinus, nor is there evidence of extension into the left infratemporal fossa.
The remainder of the brain is significant for chronic left MCA territory infarct.
No other mass is seen.
IMPRESSION: Significant interval enlargement of the residual pituitary macroadenoma centered in the left pituitary with suprasellar and left cavernous sinus extension.
Small amount of residual hyperdense material in the resection bed could represent mass versus hemorrhage.
There is a residual area of enhancement measuring 10 x 7 mm visualized in the left suprasellar region adjacent to the brain.
Blood products and small subdural collection are identified from recent surgery.
There remain blood products adjacent to the left optic nerve and optic side of the optic chiasm.Soft tissue changes are seen in the visualized sphenoid sinuses secondary to surgery.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 30 yo M with a history of a growth hormone secreting pituitary macroadenoma s/p resection in [**2195**], hypothyroidism, diabetes, and adrenal insufficiency, who presented with intermittent blurry vision and headache of 1 day duration found to have regrowth of pituitary macroadenoma with new [**Year (4 digits) **] deficits.
#Pituitary Macroadenoma: MRI head demonstrated significant interval enlargement of the residual pituitary macroadenoma, and [**Year (4 digits) **] field testing showed new R eye deficit.
Neurosurgery was consulted and felt that pt is a surgical candidate given mass effect and new deficits.
Pain was controlled with oxycodone prn.
No evidence of cosecretion with prolactin.
After remaining on bedrest for 24hrs with the drain in place, he had no drainage from his nose.
On [**6-6**] he again had no drainage from his nose so he was cleared to advance his diet.
On [**6-8**] his lumbar drain was removed without complication.
On [**6-4**] he required additional DDAVP for increased urine output and it responded appropriately.
Iron studies showed iron low nl, ferritin low, TIBC high.
#Sleep Apnea: Pt has central sleep apnea so needs 4L supplemental oxygen overnight.
Previous sleep study showed increased apnea with cpap.
# PPx: - Pain control: Tylenol, oxycodone Morphine for breakthrough - Bowel regimen: senna and colace - DVT PPx: heparin sc .
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**7-8**] days(from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and/or a wound check.
