RADIOLOGY:  - [**2139-1-1**] SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: IMPRESSION: Patchy opacities in both lung bases, which may reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.
Probable trace left pleural effusion   - [**2139-1-2**] ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion   - [**2139-1-2**] RENAL US: Multiple bilateral renal cysts.
There are mild degenerative arthritic changes in the first metatarsophalangeal joint.
A small calcaneal spur is present.
There is scattered atherosclerotic calcification.
A shallow ulcer is noted in the soft tissue overlying the posterior aspect of the calcaneus.
There is underlying soft tissue swelling.
IMPRESSION: No definite evidence of osteomyelitis.
[**2139-1-11**] CXR :As compared to the previous radiograph, the right medial lung base shows an area of increased density, consisting of peribronchial opacities associated with air bronchograms.
In the appropriate clinical setting, the findings would be consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema.
Left pectoral pacemaker, right PICC line.
No pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: COPD Exacerbation/Hosp Acquired PNA:  Pt was in hypercarbic respiratory failure upon presentation to ED and was admitted to the ICU on non-invasive ventilation.
However, he was noted to have worsening cough with sputum production, rising WBC ct and new infiltrate consistent with a diagnosis of HAP.
Hematuria/UTI/Bladder Carcinoma: Pt with a 5 year hx of  high grade bladder cancer who was referred in from his facility for worsening anemia due to chronic hematuria.
Urology was consulted for chronic hematuria and cytology returned suspicious for bladder carcinoma.
Stage III CKD: Pt was in acute renal failure on admission which improved after IVF and was restarted on home lasix regimen with stable creatinine.
Creatine did increase from 1.5 ([**1-12**]) to 1.9 ([**1-13**]) without a change in hemodynamics and without a change in volume status (euvolemic on exam), this will need to be rechecked.
His Cr was 1.9 on discharge (which is within his baseline of 1.5-2.0), PLEASE RECHECK CREATININE ON THURSDAY [**2139-1-15**]- if increasing please discontinue lasix and dose based on weight prn gain > 3 pounds.
Paroxysmal Afib- continued on amiodarone and beta blocker, pt is not on anticoagulation due to GI bleed  Hypertension- continued on amlodipine  Parkinson's disease- continued on Sinemet  Bilateral heel ulcers: pt was found on admission to have pressure ulcers on both heals.
The right side required a bedside debridement while the left was a dark blister that was treated with offloading and wound care.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Constipation.
16. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] LivingCenter - Heathwood - [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Hematuria Acute blood loss anemia.
COPD exacerbation Hospital Acquired Pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 64579**],  You were sent to the hospital for a blood transfusion and noted to have shortness of breath and a likely urinary tract infection.
You started to improve with treatment for a COPD exacerbation but later developped a pneumonia.
You have been treated with antibiotics for the urinary tract infection and the pneumonia.
You were transfused for the low blood counts but you continue to have blood loss in your urine.
You had a sample of urine sent that is concerning for recurrence of the bladder cancer and you will need to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**].
