[**2141-8-23**] - A renal ultrasound obtained as part of an investigation into the etiology of his elevated creatinine showed a right renal mass for which the patient underwent a nephrectomy.

[**2143-10-23**] - The patient developed confusion and was found to have a left frontal lobe metastasis.
A stereotactic biopsy was done that showed metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
Brief admission for recent onset seizures.
[**2144-5-22**] - Avastin treatment begun because of persistent symptomatic vasogenic edema surrounding the treated brain metastasis and because of steroid myopathy.

Hypotension improved with IV fluids.
Recurrent aspiration due to cyberknife complication.
Stopped vancomycin [**2145-1-4**] due to worsening thrombocytopenia.
Changed G-tube to J-tube [**2145-1-5**] to prevent future aspiration considering he reported tube feed refluxing.
# C. difficile colitis: Continued metronidazole and vancomycin per PEG x2 additional weeks.
# Chronic diarrhea: Diarrhea began when he started tube feeds, prior to C. diff colitis.
# Metastatic renal CA: Continuing with bevacizumab as outpatient.
# Seizure disorder: Due to brain mets.
# Anemia: Iron studies reflecting anemia of inflammation.
# Thrombocytopenia: Improved after stopping vancomycin (also stopped SC heparin); history of platelet clumping (checking with citrate yellow-top tube).
# Hypogammaglobulinemia: Consider IVIG if infections recur/persist.
# Hypothyroidism: Abnormal TSH corrected without treatment.
# Gout: Continued allopurinol.
# Depression: Continued sertraline.
# Pain (abdomen): Acetaminophen PRN.
# FEN: NPO due to aspiration.
# DVT PPx: Changed heparin SC to venodynes due to thrombocytopenia.
Aspiration pneumonia.
Sepsis (severe blood stream infection).
Hypotension (low blood pressure).
Clostridium difficile colitis (bowel infection).
Metastatic kidney cancer.
Chronic diarrhea.
Anemia (low red blood cell count).
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for aspiration pneumonia requiring a stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
Because of recurrent aspirations and reflux from tube feeds, your G-tube was changed to a J-tube, so it is lower down in the bowel.
You have also been treated for C. difficile colitis, a bowel infection, and will need to continue antibiotics for this at home.
