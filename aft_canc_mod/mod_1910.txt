More confluent opacity in the right lower lobe could represent asymmetric pulmonary edema; however, a developing pneumonia cannot be excluded.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
The right coronary artery had mild luminal irregularities throughout its length without hemodynamically significant lesions.
Resting hemodynamic measurements revealed borderline elevation of the pulmonary artery systolic pressure at 30mmHg.
There was no mitral stenosis.
There was no gradient on pullback across the aortic valve.
Left ventriculography revealed global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction estimated at 35%.
There was no mitral regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course: <b>Assessment and Plan:  75 yo M with h/o CAD s/p IMI in [**2166**] with PTCA of the RCA, CHF EF 30%, and recent endocarditis on vanco who presented with SOB to [**Location (un) **], transferred here for concern for valvulopathy.
He also received a TTE and a TEE which showed no evidence of vegetation or abscess.
His OSH records were obtained on [**2174-8-9**], which showed that he had Staph hominis bacteremia and an [**Date Range **] report that raised the question of aortic valve endocarditis and AI.
EP was consulted; they feel that he does not need pacer wires changed at this time, however would consider changing the wires should he develop recurrent fevers or + blood cultures.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy:  There were no EKG changes concerning for ischemia.
His ace was held for his renal insufficiency.
He did not have any chest pain or other concerning symptoms during his admission.
CHF: [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed here showed an EF 30-35%: CXR on admission was consistent with CHF exacerbation, and his BNP was [**Numeric Identifier 30964**].
There was a question of whether some of his symtoms were due to his AI.
Rhythym: He did have 1st degree AVB which was confirmed on multiple EKGs.
It was unclear whether it was thought due to endocarditis.
ECHP here did not show any evidence of infection or vegetation.
Fever: Likely due to endocarditis as above.
CXR was without infiltrate.
Surgery drained his left elbow abscess without complications.
Cellulitis: The patient has a recent history of cellulitis of the L forearm, with a fluid collection that was previously drained and grew Enterobacter, for which he was treated with levofloxacin x 10 days.
He was found to have a reaccumulation of fluid over his l forearm during this admission which was drained by surgery; the fluid was sterile.
There were no signs of active bleeding.
He was re-started on protonix per old records indicating history of gastritis.
