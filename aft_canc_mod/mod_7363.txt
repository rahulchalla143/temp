Admission Date:  [**2120-2-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-2-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2035-9-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Rituxan  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3963**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2120-2-8**] Rituximab infusion [**2120-2-9**] Bendamustine, cycle one, 1st dose [**2120-2-10**] Bendamustin, cycle one, 2nd dose   History of Present Illness: The patient is an 84 year old male with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma s/p four weekly doses of Rituxan in [**7-/2119**], with recent admission c/b pericardial effusion and pleural effusion (transudative s/p thoracentesis) who presents from rehabilitation with shortness of breath.
The patient reports gradual onset of his symptoms in the days leading up to presentation.
He reports no baseline resting shortness of breath immediately after recent discharge and only mild dyspnea on exertion.
He denies associated fevers or chills, chest pain, cough, abdominal pain.
No orthopnea or PND.
During that admission, the patient presented with new-onset dyspnea, and was noted to have a pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
He was monitored in the CCU, though no pericardiocentesis was performed given its small size, and follow-up ECHO revealed improvement in the effusion.
Ther patient aslo had a new R-sided pleural effusion on CXR.
Therapeutic/diagnostic thoracentesis performed, showing transudative fluid, although flow cytometry of the fluid showed a minute population of lymphocytes c/w his known lymphoma.
His course was also complicated by new A.Fib with RVR thought [**3-14**] overdiuresis with high right sided pressures and pericardial effusion.
His exam was significant for JVD, diffuse crackles, 2+ lower extremity pitting edema from calves to dorsum of feet.
Bedside ECHO showed small pericardial effusion, circumferential without tamponade physiology.
CXR was felt to demonstrate worsening pulmonary congestion and R-sided pleural effusion.
No diuresis was attempted given  VS on transfer were: 98.5, 76, 133/62, 22, 99 bipap.
He reports improvement in his shortness of breath.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Patient and his nephew report several years of low grade pancytopenia and progressive fatigue.
Patient also reports a recent weight loss but denies fevers, chills or night sweats.
Given the progression  of symptoms and counts a bone marrow biopsy was performed which demonstrated a monoclonal B cell population consistent with a lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.
ADDITIONAL PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - HTN - HL - dementia, patient reports trouble with memory - BPH - anemia - GERD - Back pain - Peripheral neuropathy - Inguinal hernia - Ventral hernia - Venous stasis .

IMAGING: [**2120-2-8**] EKG: Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature depolarization.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2120-1-31**] there is no diagnostic change.
[**2120-2-8**] TTE: There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a moderate pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systoilc dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.
Moderate circumferential pericardial effusion.
Classic echocardiographic signs of tamponade are not seen, although echo evaluation of this physiology has a reduced sensitivity in presence of significant pulmonary hypertension.
[**2120-2-8**] CXR (PORTABLE): Cardiomegaly is again seen, significantly increased since [**2116**], and appearing gradually increased since [**2120-1-23**] possibly reflecting pericardial effusion.
Pulmonary vascular congestion and edema have increased since the [**2120-1-30**], examination.
There is an enlarged moderate right pleural effusion.
A small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Worsening pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema, with enlarged moderate right pleural effusion.
Possible pericardial effusion.
[**2120-2-8**] CXR (PORTABLE): Moderately enlarged heart size from known pericardial effusion is similar.
Moderate pulmonary edema has improved; however, moderate right and mild left pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis are little changed.
There is no demonstrable pneumothorax.
[**2120-2-9**] CXR (PORTABLE): Moderate cardiomegaly from known pericardial effusion and mild bilateral pulmonary edema persists, but improved since [**2120-2-8**].
Moderate right and minimal left pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax.
[**2120-2-10**] CXR (PA/LAT): PA and lateral chest compared to [**1-30**] through [**2-9**]: Since [**2-9**], mild pulmonary edema has cleared.
Pulmonary vascular congestion has decreased.
Moderate right pleural effusion is substantially smaller.
Moderately severe right basal atelectasis and moderate cardiomegaly are stable.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 84 yo man h/o HTN, HL, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma s/p four weekly doses of Rituxan, recent admission for pericardial/pleural effusion who presents with dyspnea; CXR demonstrating volume overload and worsening R-sided effusion, no e/o of tamponade physiology on bedside ECHO.
Initially admitted to the ICU for hypoxemia, but improved with diuresis.
Respiratory Distress: Etiology likely multifactorial, including worsening pulmonary congestion (known CHF w EF 45%) and R-sided pleural effusion (see below).
On presentation, did have moderate sized pericardial effusion but no evidence of tamponade on ECHO or measured pulsus (8).
Pericardial effusion:  Moderate-sized, minimal change on echo since first seen on [**1-24**].
No echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No pericardiocentesis performed as was too small/high risk.
Unlikely to be related to his shortness of breath.
Cytology of pleural fluid revealed no malignant cells.
However, flow cytometry of the fluid showed a minute population of lymphocytes c/w his known lymphoma, unclear if this was simply contamination of the pleural fluid by traumatic tap.
IP was consulted to assess possible drainage of effusion, however they felt it was not loculated and deferred the tap with plan to reassess.
After aggressive diuresis, repeat chest x-ray showed improvement of pleural effusion.
Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma: Disease appeared to be controlled after 4 cycles of rituxan in [**Month (only) 116**], though concern that pleural and pericardial effusions could be related to underlying disease.
Rituxan was started [**2120-1-28**], complicated by a tranfusion reaction with afib w RVR, hypotension.
Attempted to give another infusion of rituxan on [**2-8**], and per BMT recs, gave pre-treatment with benadryl, tylenol, and steroids.
Unfortunately he had a severe reaction to the infusion, even at an extremely low rate (3cc/hr) this time with wheezing, tachypnea, hypertension and tachycardia.
Seizure Ppx: Sustained left temporal lobe caudate head hemorrhage and scattered acute subarachnoid hemorrhages after a fall this year.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3075**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: CHF exacerbation .
Secondary diagnosis: Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted because you had shortness of breath, caused by an acute worsening of your congestive heart failure.
Also, of note, you had an infusion reaction with rituximab, while you were in the Intensive Care Unit.
