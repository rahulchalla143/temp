Admission Date:  [**2166-1-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-1-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2106-10-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1974**] Chief Complaint: Fever, weakness, neck pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cervical decompression with epidural abscess and fusion of C6-7.
History of Present Illness:  59 y/o M hx of CAD s/p stent, hypercholesterolemia, and gastroesophageal reflux recently s/p uncomplicated endoscopy on [**12-13**] who presented to ED with fevers, progressive weakness/paraplegia found on MRI to have epidural abscess and now s/p urgent evacuation.
He was in his USOGH (works as tennis pro) until 1 wk ago when he developed fevers, back pain, neck pain and progressive LE weakness.
MRI revealed anterior cervical epidural collection, largest at C6/7, but extending both laterally and caudally (to T2/T3) with severe compression of the spinal cord at C6/7, likely representing abscess.
Specimens consistent with frank pus were sent for micro and path.
Post op, he has continued to spike high fevers to 103 with minimal maintenance fluids.
Repeat MRI of c-spine showed "increased signal of the spinal cord from C5-T3 with cord swelling and effacement of the subarachnoid space" concerning for infectious, ischemic, or a combination of both.
It also showed "significant increase in size of an enhancing prevertebral soft tissue swelling" that enhanced making a worsening infectious phlegmon more likely.
On POD# 3 ([**1-11**]), he developed ARF cre 1.9 (baseline 0.8) as well as elevated LFTs and medicine was consulted.
GERD Hypercholesterolemia .
Denies HTN, DM, lung diseas   Social History: married, no tobacco.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**] LUNGS: CTA anteriorly, BS BL, No W/R/C ABD: Soft, NT, ND.
No HSM EXT: No edema.
No focal lesions are identified.
There is no intra- or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.
The gallbladder is not dilated, and there are no stones or sludge demonstrated within its lumen.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or renal mass.
The pancreatic head and body appear unremarkable.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions seen.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen.
No evidence of DVT in the common femoral veins bilaterally.
CXR [**2166-1-14**]: Development of bilateral pleural effusions blunting the lateral pleural sinuses and extending in the posterior pleural compartments.
Renal US [**2166-1-15**]: Lesion in question in the upper pole of the left kidney does not meet ultrasound criteria for a simple cyst.
No hardware loosening.
CT chest [**2166-1-18**]: There is dense consolidation with volume loss of the entire right lower lobe as well as of the anterior, lateral and posterior segments of the left lower lobe.
There are moderate overlying pleural effusions.
Evaluation of the osseous structures is unremarkable aside from degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.
ECG [**2166-1-15**]: Sinus bradycardia (55) Prolonged Q-Tc interval (468) - clinical correlation is suggested No previous tracing available for comparison   Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 59 y/o M hx CAD s/p stent, GERD s/p endoscopy, hyperlipidemia who presented with C6 epidural abscess s/p decompression with C6-C7 fusion with persistent postoperative fevers, trending down, improving ARF and stable transaminitis.
After surgery he was noted to have continuing but slightly improved neurologic deficits related to cord compression.
Unclear initial portal of entry for MSSA, possibly [**2-14**] pruritis leading to excessive itching with skin break down, also consider given renal fx/back pain ?
No indwelling hardware, no IVDU, no significant valvular abnormalities on TTE, no vegitations identified, no other stigmata of endocarditis identified, imaging of chest/abdomen/pelvis has not identified nidus for infection.
Fevers continued post-operatively but generally trending ddown, with improved bandemia.
Given no changes on ECG c/w significant perivalvular abscess no further cardiac imaging Had chest CT [**2166-1-18**] to eval effusions given fever [**2166-1-18**], ?
RLL process but ID felt not significant enough to treat given lack of pulmonary symptoms.
ID felt there was no evidence of persistent infection and low grade temp may have been from atelectasis.
Currently on oxycontin 20mg po bid with oxycodone ir 5mg po q 4-6 hours prn for breakthrough, with neurontin 300mg po q8 and cyclobenzaprine 10mg qhs for pain relief which may need to be uptitrated in rehab.
Most likely [**2-14**] ATN (given muddy brown casts in urine, also given minimal IVF post op and restriction of PO [**2-14**] paresis in the setting of high fevers) vs prerenal vs interstitial nephritis [**2-14**] gentamycin (though initially no peripheral or uine eos noted, elevated % eos [**1-16**]->decreased [**1-17**]).
No evidence on ultrasound to suggest obstruction.
Has recieved aggresive IVF and was anasarcic on imaging with pleural effusions (improving, in the setting of albumin 2.1).
We avoided Nsaids or nephrotoxic agents.
Monitored Factor Xa levels on lovenox, recommend continuing this until renal function stabilizes.
Increased LFTs: All LFT's elevated on admission, albumin noted to be low (2.1), coags WNL [**1-17**].
Picture was slightly more consistent with obstructive process but RUQ ultrasound without stone.
No evidence of hemolysis.
Lastly, one report of nafcillin causing cholestatic jaundice is in micromedex.
Abdominal CT not helpful, liver parenchyma c/w fatty infiltration.
Hct has been stable, so less concerned for acute bleed.
Most likely iron deficiency anemia from procedural losses coupled with hemodilution (given 4L intraop).
Iron studies, B12, folate show anemia of inflammation, no evidence of hemolysis; hapto, LDH normal.
Retic inappropriately low, ?
Based on MRI read, there may be a continuing process in neck/C-spine.
All fevers >101.5 cultured but no growth.
Chest CT showed possible RLL process but ID not favoring this as culprit, no treatment currently for pna, they recommended tap L AC joint given TTP over this however IR unable to do so given size.
TEE, US LE (complete), w/u for PE (though ECG without changes) were all considered if he were to be febrile again.
Hyperglycemia: No hx of DM, BS in 200's most likely [**2-14**] infection and recent OR (stress) though could have underlying impaired fasting glucose not yet diagnosed, started will need to contiue insulin with 8units glargine qhs and adjust this as necessary.
At risk for PE as he's had cord infarct, on lovenox ppx, ortho considering filter placement ppx-favoring hold on that for now given fevers but likely will need ultimately.
Hypoxia likely due to atelectasis.
Quadriplegia: some UE motor function returning, none in LE, working with PT/OT, in hard cervical collar post-op (8 weeks), monitor neuro exam closely, guarded prognosis, will need PE ppx: filter vs. anticoagulation, risk of PE very high but as pt still had low-grade temp, did not favor placing foreign body.
PPX: on lovenox, consider filter as above, BR, pantoprazole, air mattress, wound care.
Medications on Admission: Crestor 20mg po qd Nexium generic equivalent 1 po qd Aspirin 325mg po qd Motrin prn pain Percocet prn pain occ.
allergy pills steroid cream prn for eczema occ.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Lactulose 10 g Packet Sig: [**1-14**] packets PO three times a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Epidural abscess with T4-T5 partial quadriplegia.
Acute renal failure [**2-14**] acute tubular necrosis, anemia, transaminitis, hyperglycemia.
Please notify your providers or contact your primary care doctor if you experience fevers, chills, nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, constipation, shortness of breath, headache, worse neck or shoulder pain, cough, worsening weakness or numbness or any symptoms that concern you.
