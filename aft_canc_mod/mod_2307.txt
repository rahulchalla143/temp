Initially, the pt presented to ED on [**1-23**] for sore throat, change in his voice and hoarseness that began a month ago.
On exam, he was found to have large L nasopharyngeal mass and was admitted to the ENT service.
A head MRI showed a mass centering on the left nasopharynx, suggestive of lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or minor salivary gland tumor.
He has maintained an open airway, but pt noted that the mass has grown markedly over the past few days.
Past Medical History: -HIV (Dx in [**2195**])  Social History: works as a store manager, lives with partner who is very supportive.
Gen: thin, sedated, pleasant male HEENT: PERRL, large tumor in left phranyx with lesion from biopsy, EET in place.
neck: supple, trachea midline, no LAD Lungs: CTAB Heart: RRR, no murmur, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, no organomegaly, +BS Extremities: no c/c/e, warm to touch.
Imaging: MRI Neck w/wo contrast Gadolinium ([**1-23**]): Extensive enhancing T1  isointense, T2 hyperintense mass centering on the left nasopharynx, with local tumor extension into the ipsilateral parapharyngeal, carotid, and masticator spaces.
There is also local tumor extension into the ipsilateral nasal cavity and into  the oral cavity on the same side.
Moderately enlarged level II lymph nodes  bilaterally.
4-mm right middle lobe pulmonary nodule.
Given the patient's history of nasopharyngeal neoplasm, a three-month followup non-contrast CT of the chest is recommended for further assessment of this finding.
Bilateral subcutaneous 1-cm nodules in the superficial soft tissues of the chest wall measuring up to 1 cm in long axis.
[**2199-2-4**]:  Nasopharyngeal mass bx: Infiltrating the salivary glands and skeletal muscle is a dense infiltrate of medium-to-large atypical mononuclear cells with round-to-irregular nuclear contours, densely clumped chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli and scant cytoplasm.
There is prominent apoptotic debris within the infiltrate.
Review of the touch imprints shows atypical lymphoid cells, some with cytoplasmic vacuolation.
The differential diagnosis includes Burkitt lymphoma vs. a high-grade diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Occasional atypical lymphocytes are seen.
As the pt's dyspnea and tachypnea worsened, he was prophylactically intubated for airway protection due to the risk of his Burkitt's lymphoma compromising his airway during his initial treatment.
He did well on his [**Hospital1 **]  (received 5 days of [**Hospital1 **] R, and 2 doses of intrathecal ara C) therapy and the tumor shrunk significantly.
Discontinued a week prior to admission as he had drug rash after starting multiple medications - likely etiology was bactrim rather than anti-retrovirals.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
