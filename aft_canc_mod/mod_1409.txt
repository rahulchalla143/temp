PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Sepsis with MRSA and MMSA and congestive heart failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79 year-old woman with atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, multiple myeloma, depression, anxiety, osteoporosis, status post left hip hemiarthroplasty, left knee surgery in autumn of [**2139**] with prolonged recovery who presented [**3-18**] to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 18**] with shortness of breath followed by respiratory distress, lead to arrest and rapid atrial fibrillation.
Her sickness improved for a day, but then was followed by respiratory distress that required intubation and Coronary Care Unit transfer with a diagnosis of pneumonia with thick green secretions from the endotracheal tube.
Sepsis ensued with multiple cultures positive.
She was covered with Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl until cultures showed MRSA and MMSA and she was converted then to just Vancomycin.
The patient was assessed by orthopedics to have a left shoulder anterior dislocation with no intervention indicated.
She was ruled out for myocardial infarction and endoscopy echocardiogram showed an left ventricular ejection fraction of 55% with mild left ventricular hypertrophy and MR suggesting that it was the stat sepsis that caused respiratory distress and hypotension.
surveillance blood cultures again were negative and hypotension improved and the patient's son and health care proxy Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known lastname **] a gerontologist from [**State 4565**] led to the decision to extubate the patient on [**3-25**] based on the likely need for prolonged intubation, which the patient would not have wanted.
The patient was transferred to the general medical floor for more conservative management and some pain control and comfort, though she is DNR/DNI and not comfort measures only.
On examination this morning [**3-26**] she wants coffee, she has mild throat pain from the endotracheal tube, otherwise minor shortness of breath and no chest pain.
She had wet inspiratory and expiratory crackles on bronchial breath sounds.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
No cyanosis or clubbing.
15 cm eschar/hematoma of the left arm much less prominent then yesterday.
For her coronary artery disease she is having no medications.
For congestive heart failure she is getting Lasix and Digoxin.
Hypertension is being controlled with Diltiazem.
No intubation is planned.
Gastrointestinal, Protonix to allow the patient to eat when she wants with aspiration precautions and nectar thickened fluids.
