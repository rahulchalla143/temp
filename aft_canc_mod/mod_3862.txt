HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 86-year-old gentleman with a history of melanoma, who presented with unresponsiveness and seizures on the evening of admission.
As according to the patient's son, he had a resection of melanoma from his armpit about three weeks prior.
His primary care physician drew some blood and this revealed only a mild anemia.
EMS was called and while in the ambulance, he remained unresponsive and a generalized seizure was witnessed.
He became unresponsive with gaze fixed to the left with a left pupil fixed and a flaccid left arm and leg.
Lung cancer about 12 years ago which was treated somehow and details are not clear, however, is in remission.
FAMILY HISTORY:  No history of strokes or seizures.
His brothers all died of myocardial infarctions in their 50's and 60's.
There is no smoking history.
In general, this is an elderly man in no apparent distress and no signs of trauma.
HEENT:  A large lesion on the nose that appears to be either a basal cell carcinoma or a melanoma.
There are no murmurs that are appreciated.
Extremities:  Large lesion on the right leg, which again appears to be a skin dysplasia that is somewhat dark and necrotic.
He withdrew somewhat more briskly to pain on the right side in the upper and lower extremities.
There is slight withdraw in the legs bilaterally, but they seem less brisk than the upper extremities.
His deep tendon reflexes are 3+ throughout and symmetric with no ankle clonus.
His urinalysis was negative for urinary tract infection.
A head CT upon admission showed multiple areas of intraparenchymal hemorrhage, the largest of which was in the thalamus on the right.
There were multiple cortically based hyperintensities bilaterally.
There was a large amount of edema associated with the lesions, especially in the frontal lobes bilaterally with right greater than left.
Hyperdense cerebral lesions:  These were most likely metastatic melanoma, and they had a hemorrhagic component to them.
and had a gradual decrement in his Dilantin levels while taking famotidine.
He had no further seizure activity.
He had an EEG performed early in the hospital course which showed only encephalopathy bilaterally, and no epileptiform features.
for the management of edema, while the family was deciding whether the patient would undergo radiation treatment for metastatic melanoma.
Cardiovascular:  He was ruled out for myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes.
He was continued on his metoprolol and atorvastatin for his cardiac disease.
Pulmonary secretions:  As noted, the patient had many secretions and on the day of extubation, required continuous suctioning every one hour.
By the day before discharge, the patient had decreased secretions and responded well to chest physical therapy.
He was also continued on insulin-sliding scale while on the steroids for treatment of steroid induced hypoglycemia.
He has not spiked any further temperatures and was not given any antibiotics, and has done well.
Radiologic studies:  Series of portable chest x-rays on [**12-9**] and [**12-10**] show appropriate placement of the nasogastric feeding tube as well as no evidence of any focal consolidations in the lung parenchyma.
There was noted to be some slight left lower lobe atelectasis.
There were also noted probable small bilateral pleural effusions with a slight increase in upper zone redistribution of the pulmonary vasculature.
prn fever or pain.
The family should consider whether he would like radiation treatment for these hemorrhagic metastases thought to be likely melanoma.
The family was informed of this recommendation, and they proceeded to watch the patient's clinical course to determine his neurologic status after resolution of his acute alterations of level of consciousness due to seizure and edema.
