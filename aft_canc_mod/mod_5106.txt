The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
4.The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are thickened.There is moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse of the posterior mitral valve leaflet with at least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2175-2-22**] CXR 1) Improvement of the small right apical pneumothorax.
2) Stable small bilateral pleural effusions.
3) Mild pulmonary congestion remains unchanged in comparison to the previous film.
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] via transfer from an outside hospital for further management of her mitral valve disease.
An echocardiogram was performed which revealed moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with severe prolapse and a normal ejection fraction.
She developed atrial fibrillation which converted to normal sinus rhythm with beta blockade.
A chest x-ray revealed a pneumothorax without the presence of an air leak.
As she had a persistent pneumothorax with her chest tube on water seal, the thoracic surgery service was consulted.
A follow-up chest x-ray showed improvement in her small right pneumothorax.
