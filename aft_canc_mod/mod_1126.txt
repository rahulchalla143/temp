There was concern for leptomeningeal disease, and a lumbar puncture was performed to evaluate for leptomeningeal disease, which was noted to have a high opening pressure of 27, but without positive cytology or suggestive chemistries.
He tolerated this well and was transferred to the PACU overnight for close neurologic monitoring.
Diet and activity were advanced without difficulty.
He was never noted to have seizures during his hospital course, continuation of Dilantin and/or level monitoring was to be performed at a follow up appointment with neurooncology.
The pathology indicated likely colonic adenocarcinoma.
This was confirmed on a dedicated CTA of chest, he had negative LENIs and was clinically asymptomatic without no ekg changes.
As his left porta cath had no drawback, and on history was noted to have neck pain a few weeks prior, his left upper extremity was dopplered and demonstrated an upper extremity clot.
He was not systemically anticoagulated, and this was to be discussed at a future oncological appointment, as the risk of bleed was thought greater than that of a PE.
