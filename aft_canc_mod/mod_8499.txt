HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 50-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer status post autologous bone marrow transplant in [**2181**], who was readmitted to [**Hospital3 **] for an allo MUD BMT on [**8-4**].
Subsequent to her MUD BMT, she developed subsequent febrile neutropenia, tachypnea with respiratory distress, acute renal failure, requiring intubation and admission to the Intensive Care Unit on [**2188-8-11**].
Patient was admitted for allo-MUD BMT and subsequently developed congestive heart failure with an EF of 20% per echocardiogram on [**8-7**].
This was not felt to be ischemic, but was questioned secondary to medication?
Patient also experienced acute episodes of shortness of breath, which were treated with Lasix, nitrates, and hydralazine, however, patient became persistently tachypneic, and hypoxic, and was subsequently intubated on [**8-11**].
She had been experiencing increasing renal insufficiency since her date of transplant with a rise in creatinine from 0.5 to 3.9 on day of admission to ICU.
Her oliguria became anuria upon admission on [**8-11**].
At that time, she was also acidotic with hyponatremia as well.
Breast cancer diagnosed in [**2181**] as inflammatory Stage III treated with mastectomy, XRT, and bone marrow transplant #1 which was autologous.
Patient with a history of Clostridium difficile infection [**6-14**] to [**6-21**] treated with p.o.
History of ulcerative proctitis with perirectal abscess in [**Month (only) **] of '[**87**] treated with Flagyl and Cipro.
Myelodysplastic syndrome secondary to regional bone marrow transplant.
FAMILY HISTORY:  An aunt with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mother with breast cancer.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is a nurse with no children.
General appearance:  Pursed-lipped female in moderate respiratory distress using all accessory muscles including abdominal muscles.
Cardiovascular examination:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, tachycardic, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Chest:  Crackles at right base, decreased breath sounds at right base with bilateral wheezing.
LABORATORY DATA:  Echocardiogram [**8-7**] with EF 20% and severe global HK, no valvular abnormalities, and moderately dilated left ventricle.
Echocardiogram [**8-11**]:  EF 30-35% with borderline pulmonary hypertension and trivial MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
Respiratory failure:  Patient was admitted to Intensive Care Unit with respiratory distress and metabolic acidosis.
The patient continued to hyperventilate, but showed fatigue and was subsequently intubated on [**8-12**] a.m. by anesthesia.
Intubation was uneventful without complications.
Patient's respiratory failure was thought secondary to congestive heart failure from cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology and decreased diastolic function in combination with metabolic acidosis and increased respiratory drive, as well as acute renal failure and volume overload.
Patient also had febrile neutropenia and was covered with broad-spectrum antibiotics at this time including acyclovir, caspofungin, meropenem, Vancomycin, Cipro to cover patient broadly given neutropenic status, volume overload with questioned pneumonia and respiratory failure.
Upon extubation, the patient did extremely well sating 98-100% on room air with clear lungs and no evidence of congestive heart failure.
At time of transfer to Medical floor, patient is without active respiratory issues.
Natrecor was discontinued on [**9-2**], and the patient subsequently autodiuresed very well with excellent urine output and currently has no renal issues except for elevated BUN, which is improving daily.
The left ventricular cavity was moderately dilated and mild global left ventricular hypokinesis was noted.
A focal wall motion abnormality was not excluded due to suboptimal technical quality.
There was no valvular abnormalities except for 1+ mitral regurgitation.
Her right ventricle was normal, 1+ MR persisted, however, the left ventricular systolic function could not be adequately assessed due to technical quality, however, it appeared at least mildly impaired.
Thus, at time of transfer to floor, the patient had no clinical evidence of congestive heart failure, yet it is likely that her left ventricular ejection fraction is mildly reduced and a repeat echocardiogram is recommended to assess systolic function.
She was found to have Coomb's negative hemolytic anemia with elevated LDH and total bilirubin.
The patient had numerous schistocytes on peripheral blood smear as well as thrombocytopenia and delta MS.
Blood smear was reviewed and patient was felt to have TTP (Of note, the patient never spiked fever or had recurrent acute renal failure).
Given persistent hemolytic anemia, patient was ultimately placed on plasmapheresis for likely TTP thought to be due to cyclosporin.
There had been case reports of cyclosporin-induced TTP and after thorough review by the bone marrow transplant service by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 410**] and staff, the patient was treated for TTP with plasmapheresis, which began on [**2188-9-5**].
Her hemolytic anemia persists despite treatment, which she is still undergoing at time of transfer to the floor.
Thrombocytopenia:  Patient with persistent thrombocytopenia as well as microangiopathic hemolytic anemia concerning for TTP.
However, upon development of TTP during the last 10 days or so of her ICU stay, she did not require any platelet transfusions.
No evidence of gross bleeding.
Of note aside from TTP, it was felt that her persistent thrombocytopenia could be due to lack of engraftment of platelets and failure of new bone marrow to produce new platelets.
Platelet transfusion parameters are for platelet count less than 10,000 or evidence of gross bleeding.
Despite a diagnosis of TTP, it was felt safe to transfuse patient with platelets for less than 10,000 or evidence of gross bleed, however, the patient did not require any platelet transfusions since her diagnosis of TTP upon time of transfer to medical floor.
Mental status:  Status post extubation, the patient was felt to be very obtunded and unresponsive.
Her electrolyte abnormalities had improved and cause of mental status change was unclear.
A head CT was obtained to rule out an acute bleed; the CT of the head had returned negative for any acute process.
Subsequently, a MR head was performed with diffusion-weighted imaging to rule out other acute process.
No acute process was found.
Patient had received IV Ativan, however, her hepatic and renal appearance was almost normal and this was unlikely the cause of her persistent mental status changes and obtundation for greater than 36 hours.
Ultimately, when the question of TTP was raised by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**], her cyclosporin was discontinued as this was thought to be the cause of TTP, and patient's mental status improved significantly after discontinuation of cyclosporin.
ICU myopathy:  Patient was noted to have bilateral symmetric upper extremity paralysis after extubation.
Neurology was consulted, and EMG was obtained, which revealed axonal loss consistent with ICU neuromyopathy.
It is felt that there is nothing to do except aggressive rehab and to treat patient's underlying problem.
Neurology should be reconsulted if there is a question of prognosis or course of therapy.
TTP:  As noted above, patient with Coomb's negative hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, delta MS.  [**Name13 (STitle) 4084**] febrile or with recurrent acute renal failure.
Peripheral blood smear with fragmented schistocytes consistent with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and TTP.
Of note, the patient's first plasmapheresis session was complicated by an acute allergic reaction with diffuse hives on her upper trunk and neck as well as mild bronchospasm, and tachypnea, as well as tachycardia.
Since initial episode of allergic reaction, patient has received the same above premedication prior to plasmapheresis every morning.
Of note, the patient also does well with 1 mg of Versed for angiolysis prior to plasmapheresis.
Graft-versus-host disease:  Patient was originally on steroids and cyclosporin, however, it is currently felt that the cyclosporin has precipitated TTP.
Since there is cross-reactivity with other immunosuppressants, it is not felt safe to initiate other agents such as FK-506 or CellCept.
for immunosuppression and prevention of graft-versus-host disease.
ID:  Patient presented with febrile neutropenia seven days post BMT.
She subsequently defervesced after weeks and had no active infectious disease issue upon her last 10 days in the ICU.
Of note on [**9-1**], she did have [**12-25**] positive blood cultures for ampicillin-sensitive Enterococcus from her Hickman catheter.
Patient exhibited no clinical evidence of bacteremia such as hypotension, tachycardia, fevers, or decreased urine output/sepsis.
She has been receiving q.24-48 hour surveillance blood cultures to assess for bacteremia.
Psychiatric:  Patient with a history of anxiety and depression, and was on Paxil prior to BMT.
Although she is alert and oriented x3 and very interactive, the patient has displayed anxious behavior and states that she is feeling very anxious and would like to go back on her Paxil, that the steroids make her feel very "jacked up and anxious."
Acute renal failure.
Neutropenic fever.
Graft-versus-host disease status post allogenic matched unrelated donor bone marrow transplant.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease/gastritis.
Intensive Care Unit myopathy with upper extremity paralysis bilaterally.
