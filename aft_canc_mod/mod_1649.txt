Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central Venous Catheter Mechanical Intubation Radiation Therapy   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 30683**] is a 59-year-old right-handed woman who presents with 4-day history of intermittent dizziness and headaches, and was found on CT at OSH to have ICH and cerebellar infarct.
She was in her USOH until Tuesday of this recent week when she developed vertigo and a severe headache.
At the same time, she developed a headache over the right frontoparietal area that was severe at onset but that worsened over the course of an hour.
She describes the pain as "like a knife through my head."
She noticed no other symptoms at the time, including no double vision, no difficulty speaking, and no difficulty swallowing.
There, a CT showed several areas of intraparenchymal hemorrhage and a left middle cerebellar peduncle infarct extending into the left cerebellum with mild effacement of the fourth ventricle.
On neurologic ROS, Ms. [**Known lastname 30683**] reports some residual left LE weakness and occasional word-finding difficulty.
She denied current headache, loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, tinnitus or hearing difficulty.
Denied difficulties producing or comprehending speech.

No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain.
Denied cough, shortness of breath.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.

There are at least 20 enhancing lesions in both the supra- and infratentorial region involving the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] as well as white matter.
One of the largest is noted within the left cerebellar hemisphere and has central low density consistent with necrosis measuring 2.9 x 2.2 cm in total and with surrounding hypodensity which causes mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
A second very large metastatic focus is noted within the left frontal region measuring 2.8 x 2.7 cm also with a necrotic component.
Other metastatic foci are noted in the left frontal, left temporal, left parietal, right temporal, right cerebellar, right frontal regions, and there is also a enhancing lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum on the right.

<br> [**2106-1-24**] EEG: IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the low voltage slow and disorganized background along with bursts of generalized slowing and some diminished background voltages over the right side.
The first two abnormalities signify a widespread encephalopathic condition affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.
Medications, metabolic  disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
The voltage asymmetry raises concern for either material interposed between the cortical surface and recording electrodes on the right side (e.g.
subdural fluid) or more widespread cortical dysfunction on that right side.
There were no epileptiform features evident in the recording.
