She was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma in [**1-/2196**] after having shortness of breath and anemia refractory to intravenous iron.
The patient developed congestive heart failure at that time through idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly was found back on a CT scan that was done in 02/[**2195**].
During that CT scan a right renal mass was located.
Biopsy revealed renal cell carcinoma.
Patient was also noted to have lung metastases, but a clear report of this diagnosis is not well elucidated.
Was complicated by congestive heart failure and a 15 liter fluid overload.
A 21-day intubation with multiple failed attempts secondary to pulmonary edema.
Recurrent hypertension urgency after extubation.
Profound anxiety that was difficult to control as the patient is intolerant, having paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines.
Patient recently had mental status changes in the Critical Care Unit and had a head CT through which new brain metastases were diagnosed.
Prior to the admission, 29 days prior to this, patient could ambulate well while walking for 30 minutes without shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, or pain.
She could not ambulate secondary to weakness, and she spoke softly, if at all, due to vocal cord dysfunction status post extubation.
She has no appreciable jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular exam:  She has a regular rate and rhythm; normal S1 and S2 and a positive S3 with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Respiratory: She has poor effort and better air movement on the left versus the right without crackles or wheezes.
Abdomen is obese, soft, mildly distended without tympany or tenderness.
Extremities are pale, dry, and have edema to the knees 2+.
The impression was that she was an unfortunate 58-year-old woman with right renal cell carcinoma and metastases to her lung and newly diagnosed metastases to her brain status post nephrectomy for 29 days, severely malnourished, and deconditioned.
Her oncologic issues were renal cell carcinoma in which treatment options were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Neurosurgery was considering stereotactic surgery for the metastases, and Radiation Oncology was following the patient through the CCU stay into the OMED stay.
Respiratory status:  She had clear lungs and a known history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, and the hypoxia was thought to be multifactorial.
She had large metastases as well as CHF.
Per Infectious Diseases she had a urinary tract infection.
For Hematology she had anemia present since [**94**]/[**2195**].
She was maintained on iron every day and was given only prophylactic doses of Heparin subq given her risk of bleeding at her nephrectomy site.
For gastrointestinal she had no acute concerns, but she was covered with a bowel and nausea regimen and Protonix prophylaxis.
