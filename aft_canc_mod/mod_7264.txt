The patient reports a dry cough ongoing x 1 week without F/C or other symptoms.
She also experienced sudden onset vomiting x 1 (mucous only) with no c/o nausea, abd pain, or diarrhea before or after this.
She currently feels "warm" but otherwise well without complaints.
OP clear, MMM, no e/o mucosal or gingival bleeding CV: RRR, I/VI SEM > LSB, nml S1 and S2 CHEST: nml respiratory effort, + rales diffusely throughout ABD: + BS, soft, NT, ND, no HSM EXT: nml muscle bulk and tone, 2+ distal pulses, 3+ LE edema to knees b/l NEURO: CN III-XII intact b/l (blind in L eye), spontaneously moving all four ext SKIN: Diffuse ecchymoses on the arms, chest, and abdomen with petechiae present on the legs bilaterally and back.
Studies: [**2187-3-8**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Right perihilar increased interstitial markings consistent with interstitial pneumonia given the clinical history.
[**2187-3-9**] CXR (AP port): FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**3-8**], there is persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with further increase in the interstitial pulmonary markings.
More coalescent areas are seen in the upper lung zones, raising the possibility of focal areas of pneumonia.

Her course was complicated by worsening respiratory distress following bronchoscopy and platelet transfusion, with likely transfusion reaction.
1)Neutropenia, fever, dyspnea, hypoxia: She had persistant fevers throughout the first week of her admission concerning for infectious process most likely from a pulmonary source.
History, exam, and imaging consistent with atypical/interstitial pulmonary process.
She had bronchoscopy to attempt to obtain a culture diagnosis and to evaluate for tuberculosis.
Post bronchoscopy she had exacerbation of her reactive ariways with incrased oxygen requirement and poor air movement.
In addition, she developed respiratory distress following platelet transfusion consistent with acute tranfsuion reaction and was transferred to the intensive care unit.
At the time of discharge she was breathing comfortably, still with oxygen requirement of 3L by nasal cannula.
She became progressively pancytopenic during her admission most likely due to acute illness vs. MDS transformation of her bone marrow.
Her second PLT transfusion was complicated by likely an acute transfusion reaction characterized by acute respiratory distress, rigors and fever requiring MICU transfer.
4)Diabetes mellitus: She has a history of brittle diabetes, complicated by retinopathy and nephropathy.
She had been having symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes in the early morning so her PM dose of 70/30 was decreased from 15 to 10 units.
She may require up titration of her evening insulin dose as she recovers from her acute illness and her appetite improves.
6) PPX: thrombocytopenia - no SQH or pneumoboots, defer PPI given risk of BM suppression, bowel reg.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] Senior Healthcare - [**Location (un) 7168**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - GPC bacteremia - UTI - febrile neutropenia - pancytopenia .
Secondary: -  PNH - Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
- Hypertension.
- Hypercholesterolemia.
- Diabetic retinopathy.
- Chronic kidney disease.
Discharge Condition: fair HCT on discharge 17.8, patient does not want further transfusions, is aware of risks satting 100% on 3L NC at rest legally blind petechial rash on buttocks   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with fevers, shortness of breath, and low oxygen saturations that were thought to be caused by a viral infection versus a pneumonia.
You were also put on several antibiotics to cover for bacteria in the blood as well as a urinary tract infection.
During the admission your blood counts were also found to be low, likely due to a combination of your infection and due to progression of your PNH and possible effect on your bone marrow.
You were treated with high flow oxygen and steroids and you slowly improved.
If you experience any fevers > 100.5, chills, shortness of breath, palpitations, bleeding, chest pain, swelling, or any other concerning symptoms please contact your PCP or go to the ER for further evaluation.
