Admission Date:  [**2101-7-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-7-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-4-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**] Chief Complaint: headaches  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2101-7-21**]- cerebral angiogram with embolization of tumor [**2101-7-22**]- Bicoronal craniotomy for tumor excision   History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname 39606**] initially presented for consultation for a brain tumor.
He has a history of constant headaches and constant pressure in the head which has been present over the last few months.
He also has had some memory problems and difficulty speaking, all of which have been intermittent.
He has not had any loss of consciousness and no focal weakness.
Imaging revealed a porcine meningioma.
There is no pronator drift.
There was no clonus.
Discharge exam: -  AOX3, PERRL, face symmetric, tongue midline -  Wound - with staples clean/dry/intact -  Strength - bil AT/G/[**Last Name (un) 938**] [**3-14**], b/l q/h/il [**5-14**]    Pertinent Results: [**2101-7-22**] Head CT without Contrast:  Expected postoperative pneumocephalus and trace hyperdensity in the surgical resection cavity.
Small amount of hypoattenuation in the left frontal subcortical white matters likely reflect preexisting peritumoral edema, but could be further assessed on followup exams to exclude infarct.
Residual tumor at  the vertex, in proximity to the superior sagittal sinus and the adjacent venous tributaries.
Post-surgical changes as described above.
Thin rim of slow diffusion  at the posterior margin of the surgical resection site may relate to changes from ischemia/infarction.
No large infarct and no mass effect.
[**2101-7-24**] EEG:  **pending** (prelim - no seizure activity)  [**2101-7-26**] - UNIs - Echogenic material in the central right internal jugular vein likely related to a combination of minimal non-flow-limiting thrombus and possible mild endothelial injury from recent line placement.
[**7-28**] CT head -  Brief Hospital Course: Pt electively presented on [**7-21**] and underwent a cerebral angiogram and embolization of his tumor using coils and onyx.
This was done without complication.
The procedure was of long duration, but uncomplicated.
Post-operative CT scan demonstrated expected postoperative pneumocephalus and trace hyperdensity in the surgical resection cavity with small amount of hypoattenuation in the left frontal subcortical white matter, reflects preexisting peritumoral edema.
On examination, the patient was found to have weakness of the bilateral lower extremities.
On [**7-23**], the patient underwent MRI, which revealed residual tumor at  the vertex, in proximity to the superior sagittal sinus and the adjacent venous tributaries.
Throughout the day on, patient became increasingly weak in his lower extremites, prompting repeat head CT and MRV, which showed no hemorrhage or thrombosis.
Out of concern for focal seizures cause leg weakness, EEG was ordered.
A neuro-oncology consult was placed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who recommended continuation of decadron at 6 mg q6h and zyprexia for agiatation associated with steroids.
Dermatology was consulted for a large new lip lesion that developed post operatively.
Cultures of the lesion were sent as well as a small tissue sample.
A doppler of the right side of his neck was ordered to rule out intravascular clot in his IJ after IJ line removal.
Right IJ doppler showed echogenic material consistent with wall trauma vs. non-occlusive thrombus.
No hematoma was seen.
On [**7-28**], a CT head was obtained which showed no evidence of infarct or new hemorrhages.
His pain is well-controlled and tolerating POs.
Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 6689**] - [**Location (un) 6691**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Porcine meningioma Oral HSV Lower extremity weakness Cerebral Edema Constipation High blood pressure post-op   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Your wound was closed with staples or non-dissolvable sutures then you must wait until after they are removed to wash your hair.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
