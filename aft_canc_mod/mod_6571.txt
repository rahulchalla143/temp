Per his family's report, the patient has had a whole host of symptoms over the past several weeks, including abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, a UTI, and L epididymitis.
His wife has noticed that he has been "speaking nonsense" for several weeks, and this has increased in severity.
They decided to come to the ED tonight, where a Head CT demonstrated a new L parietal occipital mass with edema  Past Medical History: Neuroendocrine tumor resection  Social History: Married.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements, heel to shin   Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS:  [**2149-8-11**] 03:50PM   PT-11.7 PTT-22.6 INR(PT)-1.0 [**2149-8-11**] 03:50PM   WBC-8.1 RBC-5.17 HGB-15.8 HCT-46.0 MCV-89 MCH-30.5 MCHC-34.2 RDW-15.0 [**2149-8-11**] 03:50PM   ALT(SGPT)-22 AST(SGOT)-35 ALK PHOS-72 TOT BILI-0.4 [**2149-8-11**] 03:50PM   GLUCOSE-113* UREA N-17 CREAT-1.0 SODIUM-139 POTASSIUM-5.1 CHLORIDE-101 TOTAL CO2-25 ANION GAP-18  DISCHARGE LABS: [**2149-8-19**] 08:50AM BLOOD WBC-6.7 RBC-4.93 Hgb-15.1 Hct-43.6 MCV-88 MCH-30.6 MCHC-34.6 RDW-14.9 Plt Ct-221 [**2149-8-13**] 07:40AM BLOOD Neuts-92.1* Lymphs-4.5* Monos-3.2 Eos-0.1 Baso-0.1 [**2149-8-18**] 03:35PM BLOOD PT-11.2 PTT-23.1 INR(PT)-0.9 [**2149-8-19**] 08:50AM BLOOD Glucose-125* UreaN-18 Creat-1.0 Na-140 K-4.0 Cl-99 HCO3-31 AnGap-14 IMAGING: CT Head [**8-11**]: Large left cerebral mass or possible conglomerate of smaller masses with surrounding vasogenic edema and causing compression of the left lateral ventricle with dilation of the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and fourth ventricle.
5 mm rightward midline shift.
Differential diagnosis includes primary brain lesion vs metastasis.
No CT evidence of acute intrathoracic or intraabdominal abnormality.
Stable appearance of radiation changes in the left upper lobe.
Possible left-sided hydrocele partially imaged on this examination.
CTA Head [**8-12**]: A hypervascular left parieto-occipital mass.
Large heterogeneous mass in the posterior aspect of the left cerebral hemisphere, extending into the splenium of the corpus callosum, with evidenceof subependymal spread along the left lateral ventricle, and with slowdiffusion.
Diagnostic considerations include lymphoma, particularly if the patient is immunocompromised, neuroendocrine tumor metastasis, and glioblastoma multiforme.
Mild left uncal herniation.
Irregular enhancing lesion in the left temporo-occipital region with subependymal spread and trapping of the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], most consistent with a glioma.
Enhancement of the right cochlea which could be secondary to labrynthitis or other inflammatory changes, and clinical correlation recommended.
Interval development of left occipital hypodensity corresponding to known occipital infarct seen on MR imaging.
Progression of post-surgical change after mass resection with interval decrease in subcutaneous emphysema, pneumocephalus and surgical site hemorrhage with persistent vasogenic edema.
No evidence of new hemorrhage or hydrocephalus.
MRI revealed a large L-sided occipital mass with edema and entrapment of the lateral ventricle.
A thorough pre operative work up did not reveal any primary mass or lesion.
On [**8-14**] he underwent a Left parietal-occipital crani for mass resection.
The preliminary pathology report was consistent with a neuroendocrine tumor.
He tolerated the procedure well and went immediately to CT Scan, where no post operative hemorrhage was revealed.
On [**8-15**], patient has some expressive aphasia, but is otherwise intact.
MRI showed some evidence of residual tumor, but was otherwise intact.
His enzymes and ECG were both normal, and no further cardiac events persisted.
His expressive aphasia was improved since surgery, but consistent with his preoperative status.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain fever.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: L occipital Mass - Prelim Neuroendocrine Metastasis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**6-14**] days(from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and/or a wound check.
