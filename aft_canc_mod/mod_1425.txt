Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum at rest.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild-moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderate global RV free wall hypokinesis.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Conclusions Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
A very small left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
There is a prominent Eustachian Valve.
There is moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Improved though still depressed RV systolic fxn with inotropes running.
No PFO flow.

FINDINGS: There has been interval development of a mass of predominantly left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
More diffusely, there are extensive areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
There is global focal effacement and loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation.
There is extensive uncal herniation as well as descending transtentorial herniation with inferior displacement of the third ventricle.
There is displacement of the thalami and brain stem into the posterior fossa as well as bilateral tonsillar herniation into the cervical canal.
A large amount of hemorrhage is also seen extending into the entire ventricular system.
IMPRESSION: Interval development of massive left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and diffuse areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
This is associated with diffuse loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation, suggesting global hypoxia.
Associated bilateral areas of herniation including tonsillar herniation are compatible with a grave prognosis.
Remained sedated and ventilated for several days as he developed hyperkalemia and renal failure.
Antibiotic coverage continued empirically.He was extubated and had intermittent CPAP  for support.Creatinine continued to rise and he developed respiratory distress on [**11-7**] requiring re-intubation.
His right lower leg began to become more edematous with the development of pain and passive dorsiflexion.
He continued to develop a floridly septic picture and HD was started for renal failure.
He developed liver failure with rising LFTs and required cardioversion for not tolerating A Fib.
Urosepsis and severe shock ensued over the next few days.
Per ID consultation, xigris was started with known high risk, but other options very limited considering his grave prognosis.
Pupils became non-reactive without corneal reflexes on the eve of POD #16.CT scan done on [**11-11**] showed a catastrophic cerebral bleed with compression of the brainstem per neurology consult.
