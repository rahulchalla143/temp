Extensive soft tissue stranding, mesenteric and omental nodularity and lymphadenopathy in the upper abdomen consistent with malignancy.
Considerations for the site of primary neoplasm include a pancreatic neoplasm (centered likely at the margin of the pancreatic head with extensive local invasive disease including vascular encasement and liver involvement), or alternatively gastric carcinoma.
If of pancreatic origin, pancreatic adenocarcinoma would be considered most likely although in the setting of elevated lipase, acinar cell carcinoma could be considered as well (versus lipase elevation due to superimposed pancreatitis).
Abnormal appearance of the posterior wall of the gastric body, concerning for ulceration, possibly secondary to underlying mass.
Possible focus of hyperdensity within the stomach on pre-contrast images with slight increase on arterial phase images, might suggest a correlate for active bleeding.
Peripancreatic stranding and fluid, compatible with a component of superimposed acute pancreatitis, though possibly secondary to other processes as described above without evidence for necrosis or abscess.
Bilateral lower lobe lung nodules, left adrenal mass, omental nodularity, and mesenteric and retroperitoneal nodularity/lymphadenopathy, concerning for metastatic disease.
Lytic lesion in the left transverse process of T10, concerning for metastasis.
Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
ERCP [**2150-3-10**]: Impression: Limited exam of the stomach using the side viewing scope revealed diffusely edematous and friable mucosa throughout the stomach.
A large non bleeding ulcer was visualized within the stomach body.
A malignant appearing highly friable 2 cm mass was seen at the major papilla.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was attempted with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
The distal PD within the head of the pancreas appeared unremarkable.
Septal thickening with reticular nodular infiltrates scattered throughout all lobes concerning for lymphangitic carcinomatosis in the setting of known metastatic gastric cancer.
Superimposed mild pulmonary edema.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
8-mm metastatic lesion within the T8 vertebral body.
Unchanged metastatic lesion at the left transverse process T10.
Diffuse abnormal gastric wall thickening, concerning for primary gastric adenocarcinoma.
Bilateral adrenal nodules/masses.
Mild pneumatosis and stable intrahepatic bile duct dilation, now status post percutaneous biliary drainage.
ERCP [**2150-3-19**]: Impression: A large, infiltrative mass involving the stomach fundus and body likely linitus plastica - this is most likely the primary site of metastatic cancer.
(biopsy) Mass lesion was noted in the duodenum concerning for malignancy - this had been previously seen on ERCP.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum   Brief Hospital Course: 73-year-old male with h/o previous cholecystectomy, GERD, HTN, HLD, NIDDM who presents to ED with acute abdominal pain and found to have coffee ground emesis by NG lavage, elevated LFTs and pancreatitis by imaging.
#Pancreatic vs Gastric Adenocarcinoma/Cholestasis: Found after workup of biliary ductal dilatation and rising LFTs consistent with cholestasis from an obstructive ampullary mass.
Given the presence of local invasion and evidence of thickened stomach wall and abnormal findings at EGD, there is also a possiblity that the primary tumor could be pancreatic vs duodenal vs. gastric.
Ampullary biopsy revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
It is stage 4 because there are evidence of lung, bone, adrenal, omental lesions consistent with dissmeninated metastasis.
He does not have resecectable disease per pancreatico-biliary surgery and medical oncology.
He had a trans-hepatic biliary drain placed via IR to decompress his biliary tree but LFT's rose again so he had an internal stent placement on [**3-16**].
# Upper GI bleed due to ulcer: Initial EGD only showed friable large ulcer that bled on contact but no frank blood.
CT with induration of wall concerning for malignancy either metastatic or primary.
Hct dropped from 40-->29 soon after admission (received one unit of pRBC's) but then no further signs of bleeding and Hct relatively stable.
EGD on day of discharge continued to slow ulcer and induration concerning for linea plastica.
# Acute pancreatitis: Also unclear etiology: question obstruction from a mass versus other etiology, not likely alcohol, donepizil and depakote can possibly cause.
Patient without pain radiating to back, lipase 1610 and CT scan positive for pancreatitis preliminarly.
Lipid panel unremarkable.
# Elevated Liver transaminases (hepatocellular and cholestatic without markedly elevated bilis), also with intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation with focal narrowing of the distal common bile duct.
cholangiocarcinoma with mets also possible is vascular lesion.
INACTIVE ISSUES: 1)CAD:  [**7-10**] Nuclear perfusion stress test: Probably abnormal perfusion study with mild reversible defect in the inferior wall.
4)Dementia:  His divalproex and donazepil were initially held due to concern they promoted pancreatitis but were restarted and tolerated prior to discharge.
Patient is usually lucid but occasionally disoriented and with labile affect.
5) BPH with hematuria on foley placement: On presentation.
Urine cleared after irrigation and patient then had foley removed with no further hematuria.
Patient previously informed he had cancer but family concerned large amounts of information were burdensome to him.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with abdominal pain and found to have GI bleeding as well as a cancer involving your stomach and pancreas.
