Name:  [**Known lastname 6397**], [**Known firstname **]                   Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 6398**]  Admission Date:  [**2143-10-28**]     Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2090-7-31**]     Sex:  F  Service:  ADDENDUM:  The patient was admitted on [**2143-10-28**] for aortic root repair and underwent a Bentall procedure followed by an emergent coronary artery bypass grafting secondary to intraoperative arrest including saphenous vein graft in the right lower extremity.
The postoperative course of the patient was relatively unremarkable until postoperative day seven which correlates with [**2143-11-4**] where she began to experience complaints of visual complaints, visual difficulty.
As a consequence the patient was evaluated in suspicion for a possible stroke or other neurologic catastrophe was suspected.
She underwent a stat, non-contrast CT scan of the head on [**2143-11-4**] that ultimately revealed no evidence of parenchyma hemorrhage, no axial blood, no midline shift.
Given the persistent nature of the visual deficit and the severity of it impairing her ability to walk without assistance, neurology consultation was immediately obtained.
The initial evaluation by the neurology staff here felt that the patient may have suffered some type of subthalamic or sub midbrain lesion perhaps a medial longitudinal fascicular lesion that would explain the neurologic deficits which were she had the inability to perform saccadic movements, scanning movements were however intact.
She had difficulty with vertical gaze and given the nature of the supra nuclear vertical gazed palsy and the inability to converge the lesion was therefore presumed to be localized at either a lower mid brain or thalamic region.
First an EEG was performed to rule out any possible disease that might be contributing to this.
There was no seizure activity demonstrated and this was read as a normal study.
On[**2143-11-6**] she underwent an echocardiogram of the heart to rule out any possible thrombus or abnormality in the graft that might explain an embolic phenomena that could explain the neurologic deficit.
This ultimately showed an enlarged left atrium in the LV wall was thickened and the cavity was noted to be normal in size.
There was mildly decreased left ventricular function with an EF of 45 to 55%.
The initial [**Location (un) **] on the echocardiogram by staff cardiologist was that there was evidence of left to right shunt at the top of the intraventricular septum between the left ventricular outflow tract and the right ventricular consistent with a ventricular septal defect.
Addition echocardiographic findings were of a moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets, and moderate 2+ MR, mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No thrombus was identified.
The MRI of the brain revealed no acute territorial infarctions seen on diffusion weighted images.
There was no midline shift, no masses or hemorrhage that was seen.
There is evidence of increased of T2 signal intensity in the brain stem at the level of the lower pons probably secondary to ischemia.
The likelihood of an acute ischemic event in the setting of no restricted diffusion flow on diffusion weighted image is less likely, however still possible.
Additional findings of MRI of the brain were scattered foci with increased T2 signal intensity in the paraventricular white matter and centrum semiovale.
This was thought to be possibly secondary to chronic ischemic, microvascular disease or demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis and the clinical correlation was suggested.
MRA of the head and neck was also performed which showed no hemodynamically significant stenoses in the internal  or external carotids.
The bifurcation of the carotids were intact with no evidence of dissection.
There was anterior growth grade flow in the vertebral arteries.
MRA of the intracranial vessels showed patent vertebral arteries with a left dominant system.
No intracranial occlusive disease was seen.
Subsequently with all of these findings the staff neurologist felt that the patient's deficits may be secondary to an upper mid brain lesion or something in the thalamus.
It is most likely a small stroke but it is not being seen on the MRI.
Keflex 500 milligrams po q day times two weeks for the mild incisional erythema at the inferior aspect of the external wound as well as the left groin wound.
Neurologically still exhibiting a vertical gaze palsy as well as inability to converge and left lateral gaze preference and difficulty with depth perception.
Postoperative atrial fibrillation.
Postoperative possible ischemic/CVA to the mid brain or thalamic nuclei with visual deficit.
