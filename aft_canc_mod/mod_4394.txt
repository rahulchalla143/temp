On [**9-30**] she developed fevers treated with Moxifloxicin QOD.
For the past several days she has c/o intermittent but persistent L. sided flank pain for several days.
She was seen in clinic on [**10-7**] and had a CTA chest that showed no PE, increase in left effusion, trace right effusion, decreased bibasilar peribronchiolar opacities with slight increase in peripheral right upper lobe opacities and splenomegaly with incompletely visualized wedge shaped perfusion defect in spleen concerning for splenic infarct.
She underwent CT abdomen that showed severe splenomegaly with some low attenuation geographic regions that may suggest early splenic infarctions, Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with increased size of the left effusion since the examination earlier today.
She undewent thoracentesis of the left pleural effusion with removal of 80-100cc exudative fluid with presence of fibrin clots in serosanguinous fluid and a chest tube was placed.
She underwent limited chest CT following this that demonstrated supra-diaphragmatic placement on the chest tube.
She triggered this morning for tachypnea and nursing concern.

MODERATE GROWTH.
Multifocal areas of consolidation are again demonstrated, most marked in the right lower lobe.
Bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged, left greater than right.
Right upper lobe pneumonia with dense consolidations in both lower lobes and small nonhemorrhagic effusions.
No retroperitoneal hematoma.
EKG [**2168-10-18**]: Sinus tachycardia with atrial premature beats.
ECHO ([**2168-10-11**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild to moderate ([**2-7**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
If indicated, a TEE would better exclude a small valve vegetation.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Marked splenomegaly, with an incompletely imaged wedge-shaped perfusion defect concerning for a splenic infarct.
Slight increase in small-moderate left and small right pleural effusions.
Decreased bibasilar peribronchiolar opacities, with increased opacities in the right upper lobe, which could represent an ongoing infectious/ inflammatory process.
Brief Hospital Course: 52 yo female with history of MPD/MDS, s/p BMT 1 yr ago, who is admitted with fevers, neutropenia/pancytopenia and splenic infarct and splenomegaly, transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with acute respiratory distress, with rapidly expanding left pleural effusion.
Active issues: # HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY Failure: initially due to white out of left lung likely due to pneumonia/rapidly expanding serosanguinous pleural effusion.
Her CT scan revealed pan lobar consolidation of LUL/ LLL and patchy involvement in the RLL too with drainage of the pleural space with the chest tube.
Patient was CT scanned which corroborated with infiltrate as opposed to edema and patient was bronch'ed on [**10-17**], minimal secretions noted, growing stenotrophomonas [**Last Name (un) 36**] to ceftaz (bactrim best but patient has sulfa allergy; resistant to levoflox).
Chest tube has since been removed with no complications.
She was transitioned back to the floor but on [**10-28**] became acutely tachypneic and hypoxic and was transferred back to the ICU.
CXR showed worsening R sided pleural effusion and she underwent therapeutic thoracentesis with placement of a pigtail catheter with drainage of >1L serosanguinous fluid, exudative which was removed [**11-1**].
She was started on Vancomycin at time of ICU transfer for possible worsening on chest CT of infectious process.
She subsequently developed worsening tachypnea and hemoptysis on [**11-4**] and was transferred back to the ICU.
After a discussion with her, her husband, and the BMT team, the decision was made to intubate the patient for hypoxia and airway protection.
Follow up chest imaging revealed a possible empyema vs complex loculated effusion with rind.
# Acute on chronic RENAL FAILURE: Etiology likely oliguric ATN in setting of sepsis.
Baseline cr of 1.3-1.4, went as high as 3.3, with metabolic acidosis and electrolyte derrangements.
At first tried to balance with respiratory alkalosis through ventilator settings but it became apparent after 1-2 days in the ICU that she would benefit from dialysis.
CVVH was initiated with great results, improvement in pH, electrolytes, & fluid balance.
Making small amounts of urine on [**2170-10-18**].
Patient now recovering with increased UOP with no acute indication for HD and will likely not require further.
Would trial diuretics if volume overload becomes an issue though currently is auto-diuresing.
# BP instability: patient hyper and hypotensive at times, likely [**3-9**] to sepsis, anxiety, fluid overload at times.
She became increasingly hypotensive during her last MICU course, requiring 2 pressors at maximal dosage.
# Anemia: likely multifactorial, [**3-9**] to blood loss from low platelets, hemolysis, and anemia of chronic disease.
Was guaiac pos but no evidence of active bleeding, on GI prophy.
chest/abd CT from [**10-19**] found no evidence of bleeding.
# Thrombocytopenia: likely due to a combination of poor synthesis due to MDS and sequestration.
# MDS s/p SCT and PANCYTOPENIA: s/p transplant from sister [**2167-10-27**].
She remains neutropenic on GCSF G-CSF and NPlate, afebrile now.
Awaiting test of peripheral chimerism to see if current marrow mostly her own or if her donor marrow is still taking.
Concern for evolution into AML given peripheral circulating blasts.
# HSV LESIONS (perineal): continue acyclovir 5% cream for local lesion and acyclovir 400mg PO BID for prophylaxis.
Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure 2.
Stenotrophomonas pneumonia 3.
