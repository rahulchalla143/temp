Admission Date:  [**2196-2-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2196-2-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2125-10-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Latex / Penicillins / Tetracycline / Erythromycin Base / Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Robitussin-Cf / Iodine / Mold Extracts  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Heaches, Double Vision  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: R suboccipital Crani for Posterior Foassa mass resection EVD placement   History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 year old female with a history of breast cancer who was experiencing occipital and frontal headaches and double vision for two days.
A head CT was done at an OSH revealing a right posterior fossa lesion with mass effect.
She also felt like she had poor control while walking.
Cardiac complications post-chemo per patient UTIs and urinary urgency s/p hysterectomy s/p bladder suspension surgery  Social History: Lives with husband.
1+ pitting edema to bilateral ankles  Neuro: Mental status: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam, normal affect.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Decreased diplopia (4th nerve palsey).
Large mass centered in the inferior lateral aspect of the right posterior fossa, which may be intra- or extra-axial.
If the lesion is intra-axial, metastatic disease is the main consideration, especially given the second focus in the posterior aspect of the right temporal lobe.
Metastatic disease could be a differential consideration if this lesion is extra-axial as well, though meningioma would also be a consideration.
There is mass effect on the fourth ventricle as well as mild tonsillar herniation and mass effect on the brainstem related to the large mass and associated edema from the mass in the right aspect of the posterior fossa.
Small amount of high-density within and overlying the surgical bed likely represent small amount of blood products, however, residual tissue from previously demonstrated hyperdense mass cannot be excluded on the current study.
Mass effect from right cerebellar vasogenic edema is unchanged, with partial effacement of the fourth ventricle and right-sided cerebellar tonsillar descent.
MRI [**2-5**]: IMPRESSION: Status post resection of right cerebellar mass without residual nodular areas of enhancement.
Right temporal tiny enhancing lesion remains as before.
No new lesions or acute infarcts seen.
There is mass effect on the fourth ventricle which has not increased from previous study and there remains mild dilatation of the ventricles.
The work up of this posterior fossa mass continued on HD #1, as the patient had an MRI and a CT Torso to rule out any further metastases.
She was found to have a cecal mass, and GI was consulted.
Her post op Head CT did not demonstrate any acute hemorrhage.

You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.
o	An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).

If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.
Loss of vision, either partial or total.
Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.
Severe sensitivity to light.
Severe headache or change in headache.
Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
New onset of seizure or change in seizure, or seizure from which you wake up confused.
Due to the complexity of neurosurgical procedures and treatment of neurosurgical problems, effective advice regarding emergency situations cannot be given over the telephone.
Should you have a situation which is not life-threatening, but you feel needs addressing before normal office hours or on the weekend, please present to the local emergency room, where the physician there will evaluate you and contact us if needed.
?Please return to the office in [**5-28**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/[**Date Range 2729**] and a wound check.
Be sure to point out any incisions, which may be covered by clothing at the time of suture/staple removal.
