Admission Date:  [**2179-11-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-11-29**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1136**] Chief Complaint: Hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy Lung Mass Biopsy   History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **]F with h/o AF on ASA, CAD, HTN with a known left lung mass and collapsed lung with chronic cough now with hemoptysis, like "red jelly."
Patient has a left lung mass identified on CT scan in [**6-1**] at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.
The scan showed left upper lobe consolidation with occlusion of the bronchus.
The tissue pathology showed acute and chronic inflammation with necrosis but no evidence of neoplasm.
Per patient's son, there was some concern about re-attempting biopsy due to recent MI in [**Month (only) **].
Given the size of the mass and the surrounding consolidation, the patient was referred to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2179-11-30**].
Although the patient has experienced intermittent hemoptysis in the past, she notes that 2 days prior to admission she experienced more severe hemoptysis.
She notes that she intermittently coughs up a significnat amount of blood, difficult to quantify but more than a spoonfool ("more like a shovel"); after a while, the coughing settles down and less and less blood comes out, and she may not cough again for a couple more days.
She notes that she does sleep on two pillows at home for comfort, but denies shortness of breath.
CT Chest showed LUL collapse with hilar lesion.
She had a mild cough without active hemoptysis.
No history of cancer.
No thyromegaly.
CHEST: Expiratory wheezes throughout and coarse rhonchi at apices.
CV: Irregularly irregularly rhythm, no M/R/G ABD:Vertical midline scar through umbilicus, +BS, soft, non-tender, non-distended EXT:WWP, 2+ DP and 1+PT pulses b/l, no swelling/erythema of the ankles/toes.
No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
SKIN: No ecchymoses or lesions NEURO:Alert and oriented.
Extensive soft tissue density occluding the left mainstem and upper lobe bronchus with subsequent left upper lobe collapse.
No definite hilar or lung parenchymal mass seen.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Cardiomegaly and coronary artery calcifications as well as aortic calcifications.
6- mm arterially enhancing liver lesion.
Differential diagnosis includes flash-filling hemangioma or FNH.
8-mm sclerotic focus within the T2 vertebral body, for which correlation with bone scan is recommended.
CXR [**2179-11-27**]:REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of the patient with bronchoscopy due to suspected lung cancer and multiple myeloma.
There is no change in the left perihilar opacity accompanied by atelectasis of the left upper lobe consistent with the known mass.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pulmonary edema demonstrated.
Lung, left main stem mass and blood clot (A-B): - Adenocarcinoma, well differentiated, small fragments.
- Blood clot.
Lung, left upper lobe, endobronchial mass (C-D): Adenocarcinoma, well differentiated, see note.
Note: The morphological features are consistent with colonic origin.
Hemoptysis and Left Lung Mass: The patient has a known lung mass found on CT scan at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital and chronic cough with acute onset of worsening hemoptysis.
However, her recent onset of hemoptysis is concerning for bronchial arterial invasion with the potential of causing massive hemoptysis.
The differential diagnosis for her lung mass include: malignancy vs. extramedullary plasmacytoma vs. amyloidosis.
Following the evacuation of the blood clot there was active bleeding and the patient was intubated to secure her airway.
Also of note, the patient's WBC increased from 11 to 12.6 and there was concern for post obstructive pneumonia based on bronchoscopy.
She was started on empiric treatment with Flagyl and ceftriaxone for suspected post-obstructive pneumonia with community-acquired pneumonia and anaerobe coverage.
A sputum gram stain and culture were sent and were contaminated with oropharygeal flora.
Anemia: The patient had a normocytic anemia with HCT of 30 on admission.
Her OSH records indicate that she was anemic during her last hospitalization in [**6-1**] and was discharged with a HCT in the 30s.
Iron studies indicated an iron deficiency anemia.
Acute on Chronic Renal Failure The patient's creatinine was 1.2 on admission, however, decreased to 1.1.
This appeared to be consistent with prerenal etiology, however, the patient's FeUrea was 0.45, which is more consistent with intrinsic renal injury.
She may have some chronic renal insufficiency secondary to her multiple myeloma.
Atrial fibrillation: The patient's EKG on admission indicated that the patient was in atrial fibrillation with left axis deviation.
Coronary artery disease Patient was continued on her home medication of Atenolol and simvastatin.
Multiple Myeloma: The patient was diagnosed in [**3-1**] with multiple myeloma.
Disp:*16 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Bayada  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Hemoptysis Lung Mass  Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension Atrial Fibrillation Multiple Myeloma Hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: Stable, alert and oriented completely.
As you know, you have a large lung mass on the left side, so the Interventional Pulmonologists placed a scope into your lungs and removed part of the obstructing mass.
While the Pulmonologists were looking into your lungs they decided to keep a breathing tube in overnight to ensure that you would not have any problems with breathing in case it were to start bleeding again.
You spent one night in the Intensive Care Unit just to make sure that you did not continue to bleed from the tumor site in your lungs.
You were also started on antibiotics for a possible pneumonia that may have been developing in the part of the lung beyond the lung mass.
Please be sure to seek medical attention if you begin to cough up very large amounts of blood, if you begin to have difficulty breathing, or if you experience any other symptoms concerning to you.
