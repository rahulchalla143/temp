Admission Date:  [**2189-9-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2189-10-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2125-11-2**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Acetaminophen / IV Dye, Iodine Containing Contrast Media  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**] Chief Complaint: liver cancer  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2189-9-28**]: Cholecystectomy, right hepatic trisegmentectomy, intraoperative ultrasound.
History of Present Illness: 63-year-old female originally from the [**Country 13622**] Republic who was recently evaluated at [**Hospital6 14430**] for elevated liver function tests and multifocal liver lesions.
She presented to the [**Hospital1 2177**] Emergency Department in [**2189-6-3**] for complaints of right shoulder pain and underwent an ultrasound on [**2189-6-9**].
This demonstrated multiple well-demarcated hyperechoic focal lesions seen throughout the liver, with the largest measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.7 cm within the right lobe of the liver.
The liver was noted to have a heterogeneous nodular echotexture.
She had multiple heterogeneous masses in the right lobe of the liver; the largest component of this mass was centered in Segment V measuring 7.6 x 6.3 x 3.4 cm.
There were four 2-cm lesions superiorly and additional six subcentimeter lesions in Segment VIII.
By report, there is a 1.4-cm lesion within Segment II.
There was also a question of involvement of the right portal vein.
This scan was reviewed at our Liver Tumor Multidisciplinary Conference on [**2189-9-17**] and demonstrated the multifocal tumor in the right lobe of the liver and also involving Segment [**Doctor First Name 690**] of the medial segment.
She also underwent a chest CT that demonstrated a 4-mm pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe, and within the posterior segment of the left upper lobe there was an ill-defined 3-mm nodule.
Most importantly, there was a heterogeneous mass within the liver in the right lobe including Segments V, VI, VII, and VIII.
The mass also extended into the superior medial segment (Segment [**Doctor First Name 690**]).
There was thrombus in the right anterior and right posterior portal vein extending down just proximal to the confluence with the portal vein.
Within Segment III there is an 8 x 9-mm arterial enhancing lesion, which by CT criteria may represent a hemangioma, but the lack of T2 hyperintensity on the MRI raises the concern of a metastatic lesion.
The hepatic arterial variant anatomy was noted with a replaced right hepatic artery arising from the superior mesenteric artery.
There is also a replaced left hepatic artery arising from the left gastric.
There is an 11-mm periportal lymph node.
Her maternal grandmother died at 38 from a fall while pregnant.
Her paternal grandmother died in her 100s of natural causes and her paternal grandfather died in his 100s from natural causes.
HEENT:  No scleral icterus.
Neck:  No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
She has a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the left sternal border.
She has no hepatosplenomegaly, masses, or tenderness.
Extremities:  No peripheral edema.
Pertinent Results: Laboratory studies drawn on [**9-21**] include hemoglobin 14.2, hematocrit 44.8, WBC 5.2, platelets 170, INR 1.2, sodium 128, potassium 4.9, chloride 92, creatinine 0.7, BUN 15, AST 96, ALT 93, alkaline phosphatase 327, total bilirubin 1.0, direct bilirubin 0.5, albumin 4.0, magnesium 1.7, AMA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] smooth positive, CEA 6.4, AFP 98.3, HCV antibody negative, and CA19-9 1639, hemoglobin A1c 9.3, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, hepatitis B surface antibody positive, and hepatitis B core antibody positive,.
In the PACU, she was noted to be mildly tachcardiac and then became mildly hypotensive with low UOP.
That night she required more fluid resuscitation as her CVP was only 2, and she was still somewhat hypotensive and oliguric.
Her labs that night demonstrated a severe metabolic acidosis 7.10/28/213/9/-19  lactate 14.6.
Despite this, her UOP decreased, she went into renal failure with a rising Cr that peaked at 2.8, and her LFTs continued to rise, with an unclear [**Name2 (NI) **] into the 6000 range.
All three U/S exams demonstrated normal portal venous, arterial, and hepatic venous flow without reversal.
She became moderately encephalopathic from her liver failure, and volume overloaded from fluid resuscitation.
On the evening of POD 2 she suddenly had an increase in her pressor requirement along with a drop in her Hct from 32->26->20   Given her overall clinical picture, it was felt that only operative exploration could diagnose the etiology of her liver dysfunction.
In the operating room we did find some bleeding from the porta and liver edge with 2 liters of blood in the abdomen.
This was felt to be secondary to her coagulapathy, as she had no evidence of bleeding the prior 48 hours.
She was taken to the SICU and a HD line was placed and CVVHD was started to help her clear her acidosis and begin taking fluid off.
