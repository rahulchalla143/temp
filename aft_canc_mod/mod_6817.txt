Urine culture ([**4-17**]): no growth Surveillance blood cultures: BCx x 2 [**4-17**] - NGTD BCx [**4-18**] - NGTD Cath tip [**4-20**] - NGTD  Imaging Studies:  CT abdomen/pelvis ([**4-17**]):   CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: In the visualized thorax, there is a new small right pleural effusion with associated relaxation atelectasis.
There are coronary artery calcifications.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There has been interval placement of a duodenal stent; however, the stomach is distended but the antrum collaped.
Multiple enlarged hypodensities within the liver are concerning for metastatic disease, progressed from prior.
Multiple retroperitoneal and mesenteric nodes are again seen, but none reach size criteria for pathologic enlargement.
No peritoneal implants are specifically identifiable.
Degenerative changes are seen at multiple levels of the spine and severe degenerative changes are seen in the hip.
Interval placement of duodenal stent.
Progressed metastatic disease in the liver with associated massive ascites.
Unchanged sclerotic L3 vertebral body lesion concerning for metastasis.
Low lung volumes limit assessment.
There is mild bibasilar atelectasis.
There is no consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.
There is a distended gastric bubble.
Duplex doppler ultrasound liver ([**4-17**]): RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The liver again demonstrates a coarsened echotexture, although without focal masses definitively identified.
Mild- moderate intra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation is unchanged.
The main hepatic artery demonstrates a brisk upstroke and antegrade diastolic flow.
Stable appearance of heterogeneous liver with mild-moderate intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation consistent with cholangiocarcinoma.
Moderate ascites.
Brief Hospital Course: A 73 yo man with metastatic inoperable cholangiocarcinoma with history of gastric outlet obstruction s/p stenting presented with hypotension, fever/chills, increased ascites and poor po intake.
# Hypotension/Klebsiella Bacteremia/Fever:  In the ED he received 3-3.5L IVF with persistent hypotension and lactic acidosis so he was admitted to the MICU due to concern for sepsis.
Blood cultures from ED grew out GNR which speciated as klebsiella that were pan sensitive.
A diagnostic paracentesis showed transudative fluid without evidence of SBP, his CXR showed no evidence of infection, and his UA was negative so no source was identified.
Nutrition service made specific recommendations for dietary supplements.
Surgery was consulted for a possible G or J tube placement but his CT scan was without obstruction, however he stated that he felt his ascites was hindering his po intake and given his recent infection surgical options were not further pursued.
# Cholangiocarcinoma: The patient has a history of inoperable cholangiocarcinoma s/p biliary stent and duodenal stent.
He has been undergoing treatent with xeloda and last received this on [**4-13**].
# Ascites: This was felt to be secondary to portal hypertension from diffuse metastases in liver parenchyma.
Doppler ultrasound of the liver during this admission did not show evidence of portal venous thrombosis; there was moderate ascites noted.
Diagnostic paracentesis, as above, was consistent with transudate.
# Thrombocytopenia: The patient initially had large drop in his platlet cound (> 50%) so there was concern for HIT, however he did not develop evidence of clotting.
He had other reasons for thrombocytopenia including bacteremia and zosyn.
# Hyponatremia:  The patient was slightly hyponatremic during his hospitalization.
This was thought toe be secondary to hypervolemic hyponatremia due to his liver disease.
# Coronary artery disease: He remained asymptomatic during his hospitalization and he was continued on his home ASA and Plavix.
# Atrial fibrillation: He is not anticoagulated as an oupatient; he is on a BB, digoxin and amiodarone at home.
His ventricular rate was well-controlled with fluid resuscitation.
# Guaiac positive stool: Hematocrit was initially slightly above baseline, appeared hemo-concentrated, and dropped from 34 to 28 after hydration.
# Diabetes mellitus.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital1 1474**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary - Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia Ascites Poor nutritional status Thrombocytopenia Hyponatremia  Secondary - Cholangiocarcinoma History of coronary artery disease Atrial fibrillation Diabetes type II   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital due to fevers and were found to have bacteria in your blood.
There was no evidence of infection in your abdomen.
Due to your poor oral intake you were started on a medication to improve your appetite.
Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet  Call your primary doctor, or go to the emergency room if you experience fevers, chills, dizziness, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, blood in your stool, or dark black stool.
