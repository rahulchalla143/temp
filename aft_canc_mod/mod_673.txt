Unfortunately patient does not have any medical records at [**Hospital1 18**] and is somewhat poor historian herself.
She was reportedly diagnosed with metastatic cancer (no pathologic diagnosis but thought likely primary lung) over the last several weeks.
She has had chronic back pain, which has worsened over the last several weeks.
She was diagnosed with multiple vertebral compression fractures and was scheduled for outpatient kyphoplasty at [**Hospital6 10353**].
She then presented to [**Hospital6 10353**] on the day prior to admission with increased back pain.
CT T and L spine demonstrated findings concerning for cord compression at T6.
Exam was notable for marked back pain and rhonchorous bilateral breath sounds.
back pain, 3 weeks of night sweats, 20 lb weight loss over the last 2 months, chronic loose stools related to her colectomy, occasional shortness of breath, anterior rib pain diffusely, bilateral hip pain, occasional palpitations, nausea, muscle aches (-) Denies fever, chills, headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea, congestion, cough, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, change in bladder habits, dysuria, arthralgias, or myalgias, urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence  Past Medical History: 1.

Gait assessment deferred; intact rectal tone on exam in the ED PSYCH: Listens and responds to questions appropriately, pleasant  Exam upon discharge: motors full, sensation intact, no clonus, wound cdi with staples  Pertinent Results: OSH LABS: [**2116-11-16**] WBC 21.5 / Hct 44.6 / Plt 426 N 59 / Bands 1 / L 31 / M 7 INR 1.1 / PTT 23.5 Na 139 / K 3.7 / Cl 98 / CO2 30.7 / BUN 10 / Cr 1 / BG 78 Ca [**17**].9 / TP 6.5 / Alb 4.3 / TB .7 / Trop T < .01 AST 11 / ALT 8 / Alk Phos 67  [**2116-11-17**] WBC 15.3 / hct 37.8 / Plt 325 N 52 / L 31 / M 16 / E 1 / B 1 Na 138 / K 3.2 / Cl 102 / CO2 27.6 / BUN 10 / Cr .9 / BG 68 Ca 9.3 UA - yellow, clear, 1.021, 2+ LE, negative nit, neg prot, neg gluc, 1+ ket, neg urobili, neg blood, 80-90 WBCs, [**11-5**] RBCs, 3+ muc, 1+ bact, 1+ epi  OSH STUDIES: CXR - [**2116-11-16**] right lung mass compatible with neoplasm  CT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine - [**2116-11-16**] - Findings are compatible with right middle lobe primary lung cancer with metastatic disease to the T2 and T6 vertebral bodies.
There is destruction of the T6 vertebral body with posterior extension of tumor to cause cord compression.
There is what appears to be metastatic disease to the left adrenal gland.
CLINICAL DATA: 56 y/o female with right lung mass and spinal mets   suspicious for lung cancer.
PREVIOUS BIOPSIES:  [**2116-11-20**]   [**-9/4281**]   TBNA-RML MASS   REPORT TO: DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **]  DIAGNOSIS: Bronchial brushing:    POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS   consistent with non-small cell carcinoma.
Brief Hospital Course: 56F with a history of asthma, COPD, R lung mass and metastatic cancer with 8-wk h/o LBP related to cord compression and metastatic lesions.
The patient also suffers from spinal stenosis.
The lung mass was sampled via broncoscopy and shown to be NSCLC.
CT is concerning for metastatic disease to vertebral bodies and cord compression at T6.
1) Back pain.
Etiology likely r/t metastatic disease to spinal cord in background of 6-year h/o spinal stenosis.
CXR [**11-19**] shows no evidence of pneumothorax.
Tizanidine (2 mg PO QHS) for muscle relaxation - PRN bowel regimen in setting of high dose narcotics (note h/o colectomy).
2) Cord compression.
T-spine MRI reveals cord compression at T6 from path comp fracture and circumferential epidural mass.
Lytic lesion in anterosuperior R iliac crest, L pelvic side wall.
Head CT/MRI show no acute intracranial processes or masses.
Bone scan completed, no other mets.
- Out of bed with brace - Lower left weakness improving ([**5-26**]), otherwise neurologically intact.
Due to prolonged prone position, pt was kept intubated overnight and monitored closely in ICU and was extubated POD#1.
Her incision was clean and dry.
3) Metastatic cancer - NSCLC on preliminary brushings ??????
4) Leukocytosis - likely reactive/secondary to use of dexamethasone.
5) Psych: depression, anxiety, current smoking addiction, former substance abuse, restless leg syndrome - On trazodone for insomnia - Continue bupropion - Social work following - Continue clonazepam for now .
- Seasonal allergies - stable - Continue albuterol nebs, fexofenadine .
7) Hyperlipidemia - stable.
8) History of chronic steroid use for unclear etiology.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath, wheezing.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation: hold for loose stool.

Keep wound clean / No tub baths or pools until seen in follow up/ begin daily showers [**2116-12-1**] ??????
Have your incision checked daily for signs of infection ??????
Take pain medication as instructed; you may find it best if taken in the a.m. when you wake for morning stiffness and before bed for sleeping discomfort ??????
Pain that is continually increasing or not relieved by pain medicine ??????
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, drainage ??????
