He was admitted early for pre-hydration due his poor renal function.
BP elevation is common in the setting of sutent therapy.
While in the treatment area, he reported a frontal headache with elevated BP 186/104.
Upon evaluation, he also had difficulties performing "serial 7's" which was a significant change from his baseline.
Of note, in [**7-10**]/[**2187**], he developed posterior leukoencephalopathy in the setting of gemcitabine and Sutent chemotherapy.
Per oncology fellow report, the first sign of his rapid deterioration was inability to perform serial 7.
Given this prior episode, there was a concern for rapid deterioriation and being unable to control his BP properly.

MRI Head [**2189-2-18**] IMPRESSION: Subtle areas of FLAIR and T2 hyperintensity in the left frontal and parietal and occipital lobes bilaterally.
No evidence of an acute infarct.
Interval progression of disease as demonstrated by the development of innumerable new pulmonary nodules in comparison to the torso CT of [**2188-12-1**].
New and enlarging hepatic metastases as well as interval increase in size of nephrectomy bed and retroperitoneal lesions as compared to [**2189-1-21**].
Increasing bilateral pleural effusions.
Ground-glass nodular opacities at the lung bases, which could reflect atelectasis and underlying nodules, although lymphangiectatic tumor spread is not entirely excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 44 year-old male with h/o metastatic renal cancer s/p nephrectomy currently on sutent therapy who admitted with elevated BP and change in cognitive function.
Hospital course is as follows by problem:  # Hypertension: The patient had prior episode of posterior leukoencephalopathy in the setting of hyptertensive urgency requiring strict BP control.
He is on Lisinopril and a BB at home, with etiology of hypertension believed to be [**1-3**] to sutent.
The patient's ACEI was held given planned contrast study and in this setting had elevated SBP up to 186 w/ question of mental status changes.
# Decrease in cognitive function: Upon admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient was alert and oriented x3 with normal neurological exam.
MRI [**2-18**] showed possible resolving posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy with no acute infarct seen on imaging.
# Onc/ renal cell carcinoma: The patient is currently on sutent therpay, as above.
# Hyperkalemia: The patient has a history of hyperkalemia and nephritic range proteinuria with baseline K+ between [**4-7**].
# CKD: The patient has chronic disease with baseline creatinine 1.7 and known nephrotic range proteinuria thought to be secondary to Torisel.
Creatinine remained stable throughout admission with no acute issues.
# Diffuse edema: The patient had diffuse edema likely secondary to nephrotic range proteinuria.
There were no signs of pulmonary edema.
# Anemia: The patient has a history of normocytic, normochronic anemia with BL HCT in mid-20s.
He was transfused 1u PRBC on [**2-20**] for HCT 23 and was given IV lasix before and after transfusion to prevent fluid overload.

You also developped high potassium in your blood that was treated with kayexalate, lasix & restarting sodium bicarbonate tabs.
