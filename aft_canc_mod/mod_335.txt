Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IVC filter placement DC cardioversion  History of Present Illness: 83 year-old female with history of breast cancer, bronchoalveolar lung cancer with known brain metastesis.
At that time, she does not report any loss of consciousness.
She did not complain of any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or abdominal pain.
She is on a decadron taper for her brain metastases, and has had severe muscle atrophy.
She does not c/o of any changes in her bowel movements or urination.
She does have a feeling of a "tickle" in her throat with a cough, but no hemoptysis.
Past Medical History: Past oncology history: Right and left breast cancer status post recent left lumpectomy for infiltrating breast cancer.
She had left bronchoalveolar carcinoma status post resection  in [**9-20**].
Family History: Her father died of lung cancer in his 80s, her mother died of stomach cancer in her 50s, and she had several siblings who have died.
Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
EKG: 77 bpm, NSR, nl axis, nl intervals, new TWI V1 and biphasic V2, no Q waves, No ST elevations or depressions .
CTA Chest: multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli, right main pulmonary artery and left main pulmonary artery extending into lower pulmonary arteries bilaterally, patchy upper lobe air space opacities, lung nodules .
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Stable CT appearance of three calcified metastatic lesions within the right frontal and parietal lobes and left frontal lobe.
No definite evidence of new metastatic foci identified.
MR of the brain is more sensitive test for evaluation for metastatic disease.
No evidence of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pneumonia.
Patchy opacity at the left costophrenic angle on the frontal view only, a finding of uncertain significance 3.
Postoperative changes within the right hemithorax and faint visualization   Brief Hospital Course: 83 year old female with breast and lung cancer admitted status post unwitnessed fall who was found to have bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Given her history of malignancy, a CT scan was done which showed bilateral Pulmonary Emboli.
Initially, she was not started on heparin for anticoagulation given that she had known brain metastasis.
However, on hospital day 3, she developed a supraventricular tachycardia (see below) to the 170s.
It was felt that the SVT may be secondary to right heart strain.
Deep venous thrombosis: She was found to have a partially occlusive thrombus in her left popliteal vein.
Since she was initially not anticoagulated, an IVC filter was placed to decreased her risk of future pulmonary emboli.
Supraventricular tachycardia:  On hospital day 3, she developed SVT with a rate in the 170s.
Given her low blood pressure 70s systolic and increased oxygen requirement, she was transferred to the intensive care unit for DC cardioversion.
An EKG post cardioversion did not show any ischemic changes.
Within 48 hours of cardioversion, she went into SVT again, but she was converted to sinus rhythm with carotid massage.
Her atenolol, which was started for SVT, was held since she was started on amiodarone.
Urinary tract infection: She was found to have a pan-sensitive e.coli in her urine.
Initially, she had a decreased appetite.
She was given maintenance IV fluids while she had a low oral intake.
Access: She had peripheral IVs.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 599**] Senior Healthcare of [**Location (un) 1439**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Deep venous thrombosis.
Supraventricular tachycardia.
Lung cancer with brain metastesis.
