Admission Date:  [**2147-11-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**2147-11-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2092-4-12**]     Sex:  F   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55-year-old woman with mastocytosis activation syndrome with one urine histamine of 9000.
She was admitted with chest pain on this admission.
Previously, on [**2145-10-9**], she was admitted after a reaction to gadolinium in which she developed severe nausea, and airway tightness, and shortness of breath.
She was given epinephrine and developed severe chest pain.
Serial electrocardiograms at that time showed ST-T wave changes and a troponin of 20 which then decreased to 1.5.
An echocardiogram at that time showed akinesis at the base of fraction of 35%.
Since that admission, she has had chest pain every day, usually muscle pain episodes each day.
The pain is worse with food, and occasionally worse with exercise, and occasionally awakens the patient from sound sleep.
She also gets chest pain which radiates to her back accompanied by occasional shortness of breath.
The chest pain has been worse over the past several days and finally has required her to seek treatment in the Emergency Department.
The patient has chronic abdominal pain which improved on Gastrocrom 200 mg p.o.
However, because the patient's abdominal pain was improved she decreased her dose to 100 mg of Gastrocrom q.i.d.
Additionally, the patient notes the presence of chills and joint pain.
Her hands have become worse with swelling and erythema since discontinuing her Vioxx at last admission when she was started on Coumadin for cardiomyopathy.
She denies any fevers or night sweats and has no headaches or change in her bowels.
She does say she noted some bright red blood per rectum mixed with stool that had streaks of dark color on the day of admission.
The patient does have a history of internal hemorrhoids.
She subsequently had pancreatitis in [**2143-7-3**] and in [**2144**].
In [**2145-4-3**] she had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 16164**] procedure (uterine suspension) followed by increased lipase and liver function tests accompanied by abdominal pain.
Subsequently, multiple admissions for abdominal pain accompanied by increased liver function tests and increased amylase and lipase.
In [**2147-7-3**], abdominal pain with scleral icterus.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2146-12-13**] showed prominent mass cells with granulation in the duodenum and mild esophagitis.
Additionally, the patient is status post multiple episode of anaphylaxis treated by epinephrine.
The patient also has seronegative arthritis.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with a myocardial infarction at the age 76.
The neck revealed no adenopathy.
The lungs revealed inspiratory wheezes posteriorly on the left.
The abdomen was nondistended with tenderness and guarding in the epigastric region.
Extremities revealed swelling and tenderness on the right and left proximal interphalangeal joint and distal interphalangeal joint, left third distal interphalangeal was warm to touch.
The patient without lower extremity edema.
There was mild palmar erythema.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  CT revealed left lung base with a small nodule.
Normal aorta, celiac, superior mesenteric artery, and internal mammary artery takeoff.
She typically had three episodes of severe debilitating chest pain per day during her admission.
She described these as 7/10 chest pain in general, radiating to her back, and were accompanied with nausea and dry heaves.
Her pain generally resolved with several sublingual nitroglycerin coupled with 2 mg to 4 mg of intravenous Dilaudid, and Zofran and Ativan were also frequently required.
Her chest pain in general did not seem to improve during her admission, in that it did not decrease in frequency or severity.
Cardiology was involved and did not feel that her chest pain was consistent with a cardiac etiology.
Additionally as her repeat electrocardiogram showed no evidence of ischemia with chest pain, and her cardiac function was normal, we felt the patient's cardiovascular status was good.
GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM:  Possible gastrointestinal etiology for the patient's symptoms were closely considered.
This was felt to be somewhat likely given the patient's history of gastrointestinal manifestations of mast cell activation.
There was suspicion for esophageal spasm given the resolution of symptoms with nitroglycerin in the presence of no electrocardiogram changes.
The patient may still require [**Doctor Last Name **] test in the future for possible esophageal spasm.
The patient's abdominal pain was well controlled throughout her admission with histamine blockade and Gastrocrom.
PULMONARY SYSTEM:  As the patient's chest pain episodes continued throughout her admission, she began to experience increasing respiratory distress with these episodes.
Her respiratory issues consisted of wheezing during her chest pain episodes and were worrisome for anaphylaxis.
On two occasions, the patient received epinephrine which seemed to help symptoms to some degree.
She was closely observed there but did not have any further events and was stable from a pulmonary perspective.
It was unclear to what extent her wheezing was related to histamine release and anaphylaxis, as there also seemed to be some anxiety component that was worsening these episodes.
Her arterial blood gas after the episode causing the Medical Intensive Care Unit transfer was consistent with some degree of a panic attack.
A tryptase alpha and beta were sent.
Her speech became tangential and pressured.
Psychiatry was consulted, and it was felt that it was very likely that the patient's mood and anxiety contributed in some way to the patient's physical symptoms.
Additionally, Psychiatry felt that she had no active psychiatric problem that should delay her discharge.
