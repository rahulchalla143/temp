Did not have any episodes of BRBPR since being in the ER.

However, at the time of diagnosis, there was no evidence of distant metastatic disease.
The patient was enrolled in the ARISER clinical trial randomized phase III double blind adjuvant study involving cG250 versus placebo, received twelve weeks of therapy, at which point, a CAT scan demonstrating increased retroperitoneal lymph nodes suggestive of metastatic disease.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization with stent placement for symptoms of angina on [**2177-7-30**], to the RCA.
Followup CT in mid [**Month (only) 216**] revealed slight increase in size of retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and since then the patient has intermittent history of abdominal pain, which has become progressive in nature.
He received 11 out of 14 doses and was stopped secondary to neurotoxicity.
His last treatment was delayed in the setting of the elevated creatinine  and urinary retention on [**2178-1-5**].

Dilatation of the upper one third of the CBD and intrahepatic biliary ducts.
Interval decrease in the size of metastatic disease including multiple liver lesions and the large retroperitoneal mass anterior to the nephrectomy bed and mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
Unchanged IVC thrombosis with extension of the thrombosis to the left iliac vein.
Status post placement of CBD stent with interval decrease in the amount of intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilatation.
Unchanged appearance of L2 lytic lesion with focal compression.
Unchanged appearance of multiple small pulmonary nodule that measure 3 mm in greatest dimension.
Interval development of mild ascites within the abdomen and pelvis.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Pt is a 65 yo m with metastatic renal cell who presented with a hct of 17 thought likely [**2-20**] to a lower GI bleed.
Hct one week PTA was 27, so this was an acute drop.
He had EGD and colonoscopy which revealed friable mucosa in the duodenum but no active bleeding, adherent clot of visible vessel.

2) Elevated LFTs: AST and ALT were slightly elevated but T bili jumped up to 5 after admission and alk phos is in the [**2171**].
ERCP was done and demonstrated metastatic renal cell mass compressing the biliary tree likely causing obstruction.
3) Metastatic renal cell carcinoma: To peritoneum, on sutent on admit.
4) CAD- 2 sets CEs negative on admission that were sent after slight change in V2 noted on admission ECG.
No symptoms were noted during his hospital course.
