Admission Date:  [**2173-12-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-12-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-8-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None.
History of Present Illness: 63 year-old man with a history significant for stage IIIA NSCLC (dx [**11-24**]) s/p right pneumonectomy ([**6-25**]), presented to the ED with increasing productive cough and dyspnea over several days.
The morning of admission he had been doing errands and found himself getting increasingly SOB (specifically that he could not catch his breath).
He also has a chronic cough with productive sputum, but noted this being worse recently as well, and noted a yellow discoloration.
On admission he also c/o chest heaviness and diaphoresis.
Additional ROS: He reports decreased appetite (despite using Megace) and weight loss.
Over the past weeks he has reported some night sweats, but no rigors or fevers.
He denies orthopnea or PND at home prior to admission, although he coughs a lot during the night.

The left lung is clear without pneumothorax, effusion, or focal consolidation.
Degenerative changes are noted in the lumbar spine.
IMPRESSION: Expected post-surgical changes with unremarkable left lung.
- CULTURE (Final [**2173-12-6**]):       MODERATE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
Urine culture [**12-4**]: No growth Blood culture [**12-5**]: Pending  CXR [**12-5**] (AP): No change from previous CXR.
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality is identified.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the inferior wall, basal inferolateral wall, distal septum and distal lateral walls, and apex.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral leaflets appear structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion without echo evidence for tamponade physiology.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF 35%) c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse process.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Small circumferential pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**6-25**], a small circumferential pericardial effusion is now present.
Brief Hospital Course: 63 year-old man with a history significant for stage IIIA NSCLC (dx [**11-24**]) s/p right pneumonectomy ([**6-25**]), presented to the ED with increasing productive cough and dyspnea over several days.
Admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress.
ECG showed sinus tachycardia, LBBB, and no ST changes (ischemic changes difficult to interpret in the settng of BBB).
CXR showed complete opacity of the right lung field s/p pneumonectomy, and an unremarkable left lung field.
He was placed on a Nitro gtt for concern for acute ischemia causing CHF.
On the floor ([**Date range (1) 31208**]): --Respiratory Distress: Several etiologies were considered, including acute-on-chronic bronchitis, CAP vs. aspiration PNA, COPD exacerbation, and CHF.
An infectious etiology was suggested by the patient's presentation with a WBC of 20 (with a bandemia) and a slight fever of 100.6.
The patient had a chronic cough that was productive of sputum, which had worsened prior to admission.
CAP and aspiration pneumonia were also of consideration (especially given the patient's recent history of pain and coughing with swallowing).
The physical exam was also more suggestive of an upper airway process than a pneumonia.
The sputum sample gram stain showed gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, suggestive of a Strep species.
Ceftriaxone was discontinued, and Azithromycin continued to complete a 3 day course for acute bronchitis.
He was also started on Prednisone 60mg as well as nebulizers for this acute on chronic bronchitis flare.
--Cardiovascular: CHF, possibly caused by acute ischemia or infection in the setting of already depressed cardiac function ([**6-25**] estimated EF 35%), was also a consideration for the patient's shortness of breath.
There was no CHF evident on CXR, but it was recognized that mild CHF might have been obscured by COPD, therefore a repeat echo was obtained during this hospitalization to evaluate his function and wall motion.
The echo during this hospitalization showed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction (unchanged at EF 35%) with hypokinesis of the inferior wall, basal inferolateral wall, distal septum and distal lateral walls, and apex unchanged from previous echo (better defined), consistent with multivessel CAD or another diffuse process.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild free wall hypokinesis, improved from previous echo.
The patient was in sinus tachycardia (HR 150s) on admission.
Lisinopril 2.5mg daily was added during this hospitalization due to his systolic dysfunction (he was discharged on this medication after his previous hospitalization in [**6-25**], but according to the patient was not taking it on admission).
--Right-Sided Chest Pain/Pain with Swallowing: The patient has had this pain since his pneumonectomy.
It is sometimes associated with pain with swallowing.
Outside studies prior to admission showed that he has a new esophageal stricture, but no evidence of dysphagia.
Anemia likely caused by his chemotherapy treatment.
In addition, iron studies suggested an anemia of chronic disease.
The patient has poor appetite and recent weight loss, so folate and vitamin B12 level were checked.
--Elevated Serum Glucose: His serum glucose levels were in the 100-150s during this admission.
These values were interpreted with caution in the setting of steroid usage.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.
