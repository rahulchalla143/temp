No filling defects or pulmonary emboli are identified within the pulmonary arterial system.
Several of these are enlarged by CT criteria, measuring up to 13 mm in short axis diameter.
No axillary lymphadenopathy is seen.
No pleural effusions.
Lung window images demonstrate innumerable nodules within both lungs diffusely, likely representing metastatic foci.
No parenchymal consolidation is seen.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN W/IV CONTRAST: There is massive ascites.
Within the liver, there are several focal masses in the right lobe of the liver, the largest of these measures 9 x 5.9 cm.
Additionally, in the inferior tip of the right lobe of the liver, there is a lesion measuring 6 x 2.5 cm.
These findings may represent a primary hepatic malignancy.
Additionally, there is caking of the omentum, representing omental metastatic disease.
The bowel appears normal, without any evidence of bowel wall dilatation.
There is increased density within the gallbladder, and within the large colon.
These findings suggest the patient has had recent ERCP, and this density represents contrast.
No free intraperitoneal air is seen.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion identified.
IMPRESSION: 1) No aortic dissection.
2) Several masses are seen within the liver, in both lobes.
These may represent a primary hepatic malignancy.
There is diffuse metastatic disease within the lungs, with innumerable pulmonary nodules.
Additionally, there are omental metastases.
3) Massive ascites.
CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: No intraparenchymal, subarachnoid, or subdural hemorrhage is seen.
No intracranial mass effect is identified.
The ventricles are prominent, symmetric, and there is no shift of normally midline structures.
There is a small area of decreased attenuation in the right anterior putamen/internal capsule which is probably a chronic infarction.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Peritoneal fluid cytology: Peritoneal fluid, cell block:  Highly atypical scattered cells mostly seen in cytology preparation (see cytology report C05-[**Numeric Identifier 39373**]).
It was felt that he had SBP and likely had malignant ascites.
His primary malignancy was likely hepatocellular, as CT chest/abd/pelvis demonstrated large lesions in the liver as well as innumerable pulmonary nodules.
He was intubated on the night of admission [**3-11**] inability to continue compensating for his acidosis.
It was felt that one of the reasons he couldn't be ventilated was that his distended abdomen was restricting his diaphragm, so an esophageal balloon was placed to monitor transpulmonary pressures.
He also underwent repeat paracentesis to attempt to decrease ascites and help his respiratory status.
5 liters of ascites were removed.
He became increasingly hypotensive and then became asystolic.
