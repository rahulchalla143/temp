There are severe degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine.
The C4 vertebral body demonstrates a large (approximately 5 mm) round lucency, which likely represents a large subchondral cyst with cortical breakthrough at the superior surface, however less likely consideration is a lytic lesion.
There is anterior and posterior osteophyte formation at all levels, with disc height loss throughout the cervical spine.
At C6-C7, there is severe disc height loss, with near bone- on-bone appearance.
There is no evidence of indentation of the thecal sac, although CT does not provide the intrathecal detail comparable to MRI.
The lung apices demonstrate no nodule or other opacity.
There is no submandibular or cervical lymphadenopathy.
No fracture or acute malalignment abnormality.
No prevertebral soft tissue swelling or other evidence of acute injury.
Round lucency in C4 vertebral body with cortical breakthrough at superior surface likely represents large subchondral cysts, but lytic lesion is a less likely possibility.
Severe degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine.
CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no hemorrhage, mass, mass effect, edema, or shift of normally midline structures.
Prominence of the ventricles and sulci with increased bifrontal CSF space are suggestive of age-related parenchymal atrophy.
No fracture or soft tissue injury is identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage, edema, or fracture.
Chest XRAY  FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph is reviewed without comparison.
Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal, with left ventricular prominence, which could suggest underlying hypertension.
Prominence of the pulmonary vascularity may suggest pulmonary hypertension, but there is no pulmonary vascular engorgement or other evidence of pulmonary edema.
There is no focal airspace opacity to suggest pneumonia.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
1-cm ill-defined right mid lung nodular opacity, incompletely evaluated.
CT is recommended for further evaluation to exclude underlying mass.
Prominent cardiac silhouette with left ventricular configuration could suggest underlying hypertension.
Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature, but no evidence of pulmonary edema.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2112-4-19**] at 10:33:19 AM Conclusions: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**11-25**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: severe mitral regurgitation secondary to (probable) partial flail leaflet  RENAL U.S.  [**2112-4-20**] 1:29 PM  FINDINGS: The left kidney measures 10.4 cm and the right kidney measures 11.5 cm.
There is moderate dilatation of the collecting system on the right.
There is a exophytic simple cyst arising from the upper pole of the left kidney, measuring 3.3 x 1.9 x 1.8 cm.
There is no mass or calculus in either kidney.
There is no left hydronephrosis.
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  [**2112-4-20**] 11:04 AM  FINDINGS: Oral and pharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed today in collaboration with speech and language pathology.
ORAL PHASE: Moderate oral dysphagia is seen, with decreased bolus formation, control and AP tongue movement, as well as increased oral transit times.
There is a premature spillover into the larynx.
Moderate oral residue remains after the swallow.
There is mildly reduced anterior laryngeal excursion and laryngeal valve closure.
There is complete epiglottic deflection.
There is a posterior pooling of contrast just below the upper esophageal sphincter, consistent with known large Zenker's diverticulum, resulting in backflow of the contrast above the upper esophageal sphincter into the piriform sinuses and eventually aspiration.
Mild-to-moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia.
Findings most consistent with Zenker's diverticulum, with backflow of contrast into the pharynx and resulting in the aspiration.
male with CHF, BPH, dementia s/p unwitnessed fall.
Presented with elevated BNP and BUN, also with hgb drop (12.5-9.5) over past 6 weeks and sx of UTI.
Vasovagal vs volume depletion from GI bleed.
- Head and c-spine ct negative, urine culture negative for UTI.
Acute renal failure: in setting of diuresis after volume administration.
He has no known prior aspiration pneumonia.
He was felt to be aspirating and seen by speech and swallow therapist who noted coughing and phonation changes with foods at the bedside.
Video barium swallow evaluation showed large Zenker's Diverticulum that collects and fills with po throughout po trials and eventually results in aspiration due to backflow of po into the pharynx.
He had a new finding on cxr that was pna vs pneumonitis s/p barium swallow.
He has slight leukocytosis (12.3) and therefore was treated with a course of levofloxacin.
ENT saw the patient and at that point his lethargy and delirium had improved, and they recommended to trial oral feeds again.
Upper GI Bleed: Developed melena on [**4-15**].
Possible cause is aspirin retention in Zenkers.
This was discontinued because of increased risk of bleeding.
h/o multiple myeloma: -History of monoclonal gammopathy.
Systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure - Echo shows severe 4+ mitral regurgitation with prolapsed leaflet.
He had acute congestive heart failure this admission in the setting of fluid volume overload from blood products and intravenous fluid in the ICU during GI bleed.
- Had short runs of NSVT upon admission but improved, monitor K and Mg on lasix.
He has a history of BPH and had a TURP in [**2094**].
Does have h/o BPH s/o TURP.
Dementia - Followed by geriatric psychiatrist at [**Hospital 1191**] Hospital.
He has short term memory deficits and has declined in function over the last 6 months, now with incontinence and needing assistance with ADLs/IADLs.
Further discussion about code status is ongoing given his poor survival potential.
- He showed delirium during this hospitalization that slowly resolved, improving to his baseline cognitive level.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal once a day as needed for constipation for 1 doses.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] Of [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Upper gastroesophageal bleed Urinary retention Severe Mitral regurgitation Glaucoma benign prostatic hypertrophy s/p transurethral resection hypothroidism Parkinsonism dementia chronic diarrhea congestive heart failure colonic polyp   Discharge Condition: Stable.
While you were in the hospital you had bleeding from your upper gastroesophageal system and were treated with blood transfusions and intravenous fluids.
You will have follow up with an ENT doctor to help determine if you need a procedure to fix your Zenkers Diverticulum, hopefully it will improve without intervention.
