CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**2104-10-30**]) 1) Decompressed colon, with no significant change in the appearance of the bowel from prior.
Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
2) Diffuse metastatic disease involving the lungs, liver, lymph nodes, and osseous structures.
3) Small left pleural effusion.
Apparent mild wall thickening of the descending and sigmoid colon may be due to underdistension.
However, given underlying diverticulosis, and mild stranding around the ascending and left colon, a focal/segmental colitis secondary to diverticulitis, or other infectious or ischemic etiologies could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
New small bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary this is a 53 year-old man with history of metastatic esophageal CA, DVT, renal transplant, and hypertension presenting with abdominal pain, low grade fevers and concern for diverticulitis vs colitis.
# Abdominal Pain There was concern for diverticulitis/colitis, especially in the setting of past h/o diverticulitis and current immunosuppression.
Blood cultures returned negative x2 and abdominal pain improved significantly by HD 2.
# History of DVT/PE He had been on Lovenox but this was stopped during previous admission due to hematemesis.
# ESRD [**2-2**] to IgA Nephropathy s/p Kidney Transplant [**2091**] and [**2101**] He was continued on tacrolimus and dexamethasone.
He was continued on Bactrim for prophylaxis.
# H/o GI bleed He is s/p recent upper endoscopy and cauterization to bleeding esophageal mass.
# Hyperlipidemia We continued his outpatient Lipitor.
Tacrolimus 1 mg Capsule Sig: Four (4) Capsule PO Q12H (every 12 hours) as needed for transplant.
