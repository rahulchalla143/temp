Brief Hospital Course: 78 yo M with PMH of NSCLC s/p wedge resection x 2, COPD on home O2, hypertension presents with acute onset SOB and worsening failure to thrive over 3 weeks.
SOB: Was thought to be primarily due to acute on chronic diastolic CHF with concominant COPD exacerbation.
Was started on emperic lovenox and abx, these were both discontinued once CTA chest confirmed no PE or no pneumonia.
The patient improved significantly with diureses and standing nebs and steroid taper, however, patient eventually plateaud and continued to complain of SOB and wheezing.
This was most likely secondary to excess fluid remaining.
Patient had a small cardiac enzyme leak, likely demand related during his acute hypoxic and tachypnic episode.
The patient still has room to go for diuresis (still has 1+ pitting pedal edema), and will need to continue high dose PO Lasix (120mg PO BID) for 7 days until titrated back down to a maintanaince regimen.
Repeat CT scan did not show significant change in disease progression.
COPD: Noted wheezes and rhonchi on exam on admission.
Wheezes persisted on thought to be likely secondary to diastolic CHF.
HTN: continue ACE and bblocker for afterload reduction.
Started Carvedolol for patient's heart failure.
Aminitis: Patient had a mild transaminitis, the slightly worsened but remained otherwise stable.
Labs were not c/w obstructive etiology.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath and chest pain.
Your respiratory failure was thought to be due acute diastolic heart failure, when your heart does not pump effectively.
Your heart failure improved with lasix or water pills, which helped to get rid of the fluid in your lungs to help you breath.
Please return to the emergency department for chest pain, shortness of breath, or high fevers, or any other symptoms that are concerning to you.
