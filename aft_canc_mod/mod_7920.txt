)Shortness of breath -- Mrs. [**Known lastname **] has recurrent pneumonias resulting from her esophogeal stricture, which causes food to stick while swallowing, forcing her to induce emesis, resulting in aspiration.
It was felt there may have been both an aspiration pneumonia as well as an exacerbation of her COPD.
During the bronchoscopy, she developed severe bronchospasm, was intubated, and transferred to the MICU, where she rapidly improved with steroids and scheduled nebs.
Ultimately, her BAL returned with no microbiological growth, and her antibiotics were stopped, as she was afebrile, was responding best to COPD tx, and was felt not to be infected.
On this course, she did well with improved O2 saturation, baseline SOB, and no fevers or cough.
She came in on warfarin, with an INR of 3.3  Warfarin was held and she was put on heparin for invasive procedures.
