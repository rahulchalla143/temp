Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Exploratory laparotomy, biopsy of mesenteric nodules x2, resection of ischemic ileum and primary anastomosis, biopsy of pancreatic mass.
She has been having 2-3 weeks of abdominal pain after eating.
Her pain worsened the evening of [**2141-8-19**].
A CT scan obtained at [**Hospital3 7571**]was concerning for ischemia small bowel and a pancreatic mid body mass.
Past Medical History: SVT Hypercholesterolemia Peptic ulcer disease Atrial fibrillation H/O XRT for bronchitis at age 2, now with chronic wound on back  Social History: She denies alcohol abuse.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Temp 98.6 HR 113 BP 126/45 RR 15 O2 sat 97% on RA Gen: obviously in pain CV: regular rhythm, tachy Pulm: clear bilaterally.
Large open wound on mid back with chronic XRT changes surrounding it.
Abd: diffuse abdominal tenderness, rigid with guarding and rebound.
No masses palpable.
Mesenteric node (A): Fibroadipose tissue with metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma; see note #1.
No definite lymph node seen.
Mesenteric nodule (B): Fibroadipose tissue, no malignancy identified.
Proximal and mild ileum (C-L): Small bowel with mucosal and transmural hemorrhagic infarction.
Distal ileum (M-O): Small bowel with mucosal ischemia present at one of two margins.
Note #1: There is no unequivocal carcinoma present on the original frozen sections.
Note #2: The tumor and the metastasis represented in specimens 1 and 5 are positive for cytokeratin 7; negative stains include CK20, ER, PR, mammoglobin, and GCDFP.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a mild (20mmHg peak) resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic gradient is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

After fluid resusitation, she was immediately taken to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy where she was found to have infarcted small bowel.
Two mesenteric nodule were biopsied as well as the pancreatic mid body mass.
Pathology ultimately revealed metastatic pancreatic carcinoma.
Neurological:  She is alert and oriented and her mental status appears to be back to baseline.
Cardiovascular:  On POD1 she became hypotensive and required pressors, which were quickly weaned.
She also went into atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, which required a diltiazem drip.
Skin:  She has a chronic back wound secondary to radiation therapy received as a child.
This wound requires daily dressing changes with Aquacel AG.
Heme:  She was started on anticoagulation due to the unknown etiology of her small bowel ischemia.
Metastatic pancreatic carcinoma.
Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: Please call your surgeon if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, fever greater than 101.5, foul smelling or colorful drainage from your incisions, redness or swelling, severe abdominal pain or distention, persistent nausea or vomiting, inability to eat or drink, or any other symptoms which are concerning to you.
