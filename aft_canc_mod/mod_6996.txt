[**2135-9-16**] MRI C-Spine, T-Spine and L-Spine CERVICAL SPINE: There are no prior cervical spine MRI studies available for comparison.
From craniocervical junction to C7 level, no evidence of bony metastasis seen.
Mild heterogeneity of marrow signal seen.
At C3-4, there is moderate spinal stenosis due to disc degenerative change, bulging, and thickening of the ligaments identified with indentation on the spinal cord.
At C4-5, mild degenerative changes seen.
At C5-6, mild-to-moderate spinal stenosis and mild extrinsic indentation on the spinal cord seen.
At C6-7 and C7-T1, mild degenerative changes identified.
There is no abnormal signal seen within the spinal cord.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of bony metastatic disease in the cervical region.
Cervical spondylosis with moderate spinal stenosis at C3-4 and mild-to-moderate spinal stenosis at C5-6 with extrinsic indentation on the spinal cord.
No abnormal signal within the spinal cord.
No abnormal enhancement.
THORACIC SPINE:  There is a bony metastasis within the left side of the T1 vertebral body.
There are no prior MRI examinations of the thoracic spine available.
In addition, subtle decreased signal in T10 vertebral body also indicates metastatic disease.
The T11 vertebra again demonstrates an infiltrative process and compression fracture with retropulsion and compression of the spinal cord at this level which has remained deformed in appearance.
There is no abnormal signal seen within the spinal cord.
There are epidural soft tissue changes seen at this level.
IMPRESSION: There is pathologic compression fracture at T11 level with compression of the spinal cord and epidural soft tissue changes which is again identified and is unchanged since [**2135-6-14**].
LUMBAR SPINE:  Focal bony abnormalities are seen in the L3 and S1 vertebral bodies, indicative of bony metastatic disease, not significantly changed from previous MRI.
At L4-5, grade 1 spondylolisthesis of L4 over L5 seen with facet degenerative changes and thickening of the ligaments resulting in moderate-to-severe spinal stenosis and moderate-to-severe left-sided and severe right-sided foraminal narrowing.
At L5-S1 level, disc and facet degenerative changes and mild anterolisthesis identified.
There is severe right-sided and moderate left-sided foraminal narrowing.
Moderate spinal stenosis seen.
The sacrum demonstrates involvement of the S2 portion as well as the left ala of sacrum secondary to metastatic disease.
Focal metastasis is also seen in the right posterior ilium.
IMPRESSION: Overall no significant change in appearance of the lumbar spine seen compared with the previous MRI of [**2135-6-14**].
Degenerative changes with spondylolisthesis of L4 over L5 and L5 over S1 again noted as described above.
Incidentally noted is somewhat distended urinary bladder.
Brief Hospital Course: #Low Back Pain: Patient has chronic back pain which became acutely worse and was no longer controlled on his home pain medications.
He pain is secondary to prostate  metastases to his spine.
He also had worsening lower extremity weakness particularly of his right leg.
There was concern for instability at T11 and he went to the OR on [**2135-9-21**] where under general anesthesia he underwent T9 to L1 fusion with vertebrectomy T11.
#Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Patient has metastatic prostate cancer, recently treated with taxotere.
Patient had 3+ lower extremity edema but no paroxysymal nocturnal dyspnea, no orthopnea but has occasional dyspnea on extertion.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 4316**] Rehabilitation & [**Hospital **] Care Center - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic prostate cancer to T11   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital with increased back pain and right leg weakness.
Your pain and weakness were caused by your prostate cancer that had spread to your spine.
You were treated with steroids to decrease the swelling around the spine.
The following changes were made to your medications: -INCREASED oxycontin from 10 mg twice a day to 10 mg three times a day -ADDED Acetominophen 650 mg every 6 hours -ADDED Cyclobenzaprine as needed for back spasms -ADDED Gabapentin -ADDED Bisacodyl and Miralax as needed for constipation -ADDED Nystatin   Followup Instructions: Please follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] in 1 week for staple removal or these may be removed at rehab on [**2135-10-5**].
