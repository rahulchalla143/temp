Admission Date:  [**2155-6-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2155-7-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2097-6-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: UROLOGY  Allergies: Ciprofloxacin / Percocet  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1232**] Chief Complaint: Hematuria  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Radical nephrectomy with IVC thrombectomy ([**6-25**])   History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known lastname 1024**] is a 58 year-old woman with recent diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma with IVC infiltration who was transferred from an OSH with hematuria and anemia.
CT scan showed and a renal mass invading the IVC.
4 days ago she started having frank hematuria and felt lightheaded and nauseous (she vomited x 1 the night before).
She did not have a foley placed and continued to have transient obstructions in her urinary stream.
She denies fevers or dysuria.
She has had chills and urinary frequency.
Past Medical History: Diabetes with retinopathy .
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Renal cell carcinoma with invasion of the IVC diagnosed by CT 3 weeks ago after patient noted hematuria.
She has been evaluated for surgery at [**Hospital3 **] and [**Hospital1 2025**] but was not thought to be a surgical candidate.
Smoked 1 ppd till 6 months ago (previously smoked on and off for 40 yrs) Denies drug use, has occasional ETOH use  Family History: Grandmother with pancreatic cancer mother with abdominal cancer aunt had lung cancer  Physical Exam: VS: T 100.0 HR 90 BP150/70  RR 18 Sat 97% RA HEENT: anicteric sclera, MMM Neck: supple, no LAD Pulm: CTAB Cardio: RRR, 2/6 systolic murmur loudest at LUSB, nl S1 S2 Abdomen: soft, NT, ND, +BS, no hepatosplenomegaly Ext: no edema, 2+ DP pulses Neuro: Cn 2-12 intact, PERRL, muscle strength 5/5 in upper and lower extremities, sensation to light touch intact Skin: few petechia on LLQ of abd Back: no point tenderness, no CVA tenderness  Pertinent Results: CT chest/abdomen from [**2155-6-2**] at OSH per reports: multiple b/l pulmonary nodules compatible with metastatic diseaes and the renal mass with filling defect involving the right renal vein into the vena cava but not the right atrium .
Bone scan from OSH: no evidence of bony metastases .
MRI ABDOMEN [**2155-6-19**]: [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 58 year old woman with presumed new diagnosis of metastatic renal cell CA with PROBABLE IVC involvement (per report from CT at OSH) REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: assess extent of tumor burden, IVC involvement, vascularity of malignancy CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATIONS: Presumed new diagnosis of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, probable IVC involvement at outside hospital.
Assess extent of tumor burden and IVC involvement.
FINDINGS: There is a very large, irregular, infiltrative mass occupying and expanding the entire upper pole of the right kidney measuring up to 10.1 x 8.9 x 8.6 cm.
Heterogeneous areas of internal signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images are present.
No definite fat-containing areas are present internally, but there are likely areas of central necrosis.
There is no evidence of extension into the right atrium.
There is distention of the lower pole collecting system, which is filled with low signal intensity material on T2- weighted images.
There is thickening and enhancement along the proximal right ureter.
This is seen adjacent to areas where there is extensive heterogeneity in signal in the perirenal fat as well as multiple parasitized vessels crossing the right ureter.
There is no evidence of tumor in the left kidney or left adrenal gland.
There is a single left renal artery and a conventional left renal vein which is anterior to the aorta.
There is a tiny well-circumscribed lesion in the inferior right lobe of the liver (segment VI) which is of high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, and is likely a cyst with rim enhancement.
There is a rounded 14-mm focus of high signal intensity on T2-weighted images within L1 which is most likely a hemangioma.
Large infiltrative mass occupying and expanding entire upper pole of right kidney measuring up to 10.1 cm.
Presence of renal vein/IVC invasion is suggestive of a clear cell renal carcinoma.
Tumor thrombus extending through the right renal vein into IVC.
Multiple additional collateral parasitized vessels.
Clot distending right renal pelvis and collecting system.
Thickening and enhancement along proximal right ureter is most likely secondary to venous/lymphatic engorgement and multiple crossing parasitized vessels.
MIcroinvasion of tumor is considered less likely.
CT HEAD [**2155-6-24**]: There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass effect, enhancing mass lesions, shift of normally structures, or hydrocephalus.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease.
GRAM POSITIVE BACTERIA.
10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..          Alpha hemolytic colonies consistent with alpha streptococcus or          Lactobacillus sp.
Blood Cultures        **FINAL REPORT [**2155-6-28**]**     AEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2155-6-28**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2155-6-28**]):    NO GROWTH.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 58 yo female with newly diagnosed RCC with infiltration into the IVC and likely lung mets who presents with hematuria with transient urinary obstruction [**3-7**] clots and anemia.
1) Hematuria:   Patient with newly diagnosed renal cell carcinoma complicated by frank hematuria requiring transfusion at outside hospital.
She arrived without a foley, but continued to pass frequent blood clots and ultimately became obstructed with urinary retention.
Due to her high clot volume and resulting bladder spasms, the foley became obstructed on multiple occasions, and occasionally was propelled out of the bladder due to spasms.
It required frequent manual irrigation to flush clots, in addition to continuous bladder irrigation.
Of note, CT of the chest at an outside hospital showed multiple pulmonary nodules consistent with mesastatic disease.
A CT of the head was negative and an MRI of the abdomen showed extension of tumor into the IVC.
*RCC: Given her symptomatic hematuria and hemodynamic instability, Urology was consulted for a nephrectomy during this hospitalization.
Her pain was then controlled with toradol and a dilaudid PCA.
Of note, her urine output was normal, her creatinine was at baseline, and no active bleeding was seen in the urine.
On POD2 she was transferred out of the ICU and her chest tube was removed as no pneumothorax was seen on CXR.
She had no active emesis but did feel nauseated.
Patient has had cough for several months, urinary urgency and chills.
Likely d/t UTI or URI.
-check bcx, ucx, CXR -Urine culture was positive for MSSA and an alpha hemolytic gram positive bacteria.
