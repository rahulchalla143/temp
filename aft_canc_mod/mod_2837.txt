Admission Date:  [**2176-12-26**]     Discharge Date:  [**2177-1-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2119-8-3**]     Sex:  F  Service:  General Surgery Gold  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 57-year-old female, who has a history of progressive abdominal pain due to pancreatitis secondary to an enlarging cystic lesion in the body of the pancreas.
The increasing size and radiographic characteristics of the lesion suggested a cystic neoplasm rather than a pseudocyst and an endoscopic ultrasound with FNA biopsies was recently performed, which demonstrated adenocarcinoma rather than mucinous cystadenoma.
Local nodes obtained at the time were negative for malignancy, and the patient therefore presented to this institution for an elective pancreatectomy.
New onset insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus.
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
General: Patient is a mildly obese female, who appears her stated age and is in no apparent distress.
Neck is supple and nontender with no lymphadenopathy or masses.
No palpable masses.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.
The estimated blood loss for the procedure was approximately 600 cc.
The patient's pain was controlled in the postoperative period with an epidural catheter.
The patient's early postoperative course was complicated by a low grade temperature to 101.0 F on postoperative day two.
This was attributed to respiratory secretions and poor pulmonary hygiene.
Her epidural catheter was removed and her pain was then controlled with a PCA analgesic pump.
On the evening of postoperative day two, the patient developed respiratory distress with oxygenation in the low 80s and respiratory rate to the 30s.
Upon discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], it seemed prudent to intubate patient given her smoking history and her appearance of respiratory fatigue.
The post intubation chest x-ray demonstrated congestive heart failure which was treated with intravenous diuretics.
She also had an elevated temperature to 101.2 F along with a leukocytosis which is 28.5.
She finished up a seven day course of Levaquin for her presumed pneumonia on postoperative day nine.
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
The patient was instructed to followup sooner if she develops fevers greater than 101.5 F, vomiting, or severe abdominal pain.
