CT HEAD [**2121-9-29**]: No mass or hemorrhage; stable L. occiptal bright area c/w calcification.
Mr head: FINDINGS: There is no slow diffusion to indicate an acute infarct.
There are no areas of abnormal enhancement.
Since the prior examination, there has been no change.
Again, there are areas of magnetic susceptibility in the medial left occipital lobe, two foci in the left frontal lobe and within the left putamen.
Lesions within the left occipital lobe and within the left frontal lobe are associated with small amounts of adjacent T2 signal hyperintensity, which is unchanged.
The additional left frontal lobe lesion as well as the lesion in the left putamen are present but more subtle on the prior examination.
No additional foci of abnormal brain parenchymal signal are noted.
There is no mass effect or hydrocephalus.
No MR evidence of prior myocardial scarring/infarction.
No MR evidence of right ventricular fatty infiltration/dysplasia.
The indexed diameters of the ascending aorta and descending thoracic aorta were mildly increased.
The main pulmonary artery diameter index was mildly increased.
There was no focal mass within the pericardium or within the myocardium.
There is no MR evidence of infiltrative disease.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or  color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear  structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
MR head [**10-13**]: FINDINGS: Since the prior examination, there has been no change in appearance of foci of magnetic susceptibility in the medial left occipital lobe, right occipital lobe, left frontal lobe and the left putamen.
There is slight enhancement in the left parietal lesion.
No additional foci of abnormal brain parenchymal signal are noted.
There is no mass effect or hydrocephalus.
IMPRESSION: No significant change from the prior examination with stable lesions as described above, likely representing old infarct with hemorrhage .
Right cephalic thrombosis surrounding PICC line.
[**10-14**] cxr:  No acute process .
No macroscopic pulmonary nodules are seen.
New micronodulation and background heterogeneity in the right lower lobe consistent with mild bronchiolitis, either infectious or related to graft- versus-host disease.
No pulmonary fibrosis or extensive interstitial lung disease or evidence of pyogenic or fungal infection.
Brief Hospital Course: 34 vietnamese male with history of CML status post sibling-matched allo-bmt in [**2117**], with transplant course complicated by GVHD (skin, muscle) on rituximab, toxoplasmosis, CMV reactivation, who presented from clinic for fevers, hypotension, and continued headaches, found to have enterovirus meningitis.
He had a prolonged hospital course with admission to the ICU and complicated by a RUE clot and dizziness.
Given the concern for sepsis versus adrenal insufficiency the patient went to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient was treated  empirically for csf infection (ampicillin, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ayclovir), given IVF and stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone 100mg iv q8h).
Fever/Viral meningitis: The patient presented with headache, photophobia and lethargy which was most concerning for meningitis or reactivated toxoplasmosis.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient had a lumbar puncture and was seen by neurology.
He was started empirically on treatment for meningitis (amp, vanc, ctx and acyclovir) and in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] remained febrile, with continued diplopia and photophobia.
His MRI showed lesions in the frontal and occipital lobes that had been present on previous scans, and looked improved.
His second lumbar puncture was significant for leukocytosis and lymphocytosis making viral meningitis likely (WBC: 150 rbc: 0  poly: 4, lymphs:80, monos: 16 and wbc: 170, rbc: 10, poly: 6, lymphs:86 and monos: 8).
Based on this while cx were pending he continued treatment for meningitis.
His work-up (CMV viral load negative, Urine legionella negative, Blood culture negative, Stool culture, Lyme Ab negative, Cryptococcal Ag neg, CMV viral load neg, Toxoplasma IgG neg, Toxoplasma IgM pos and CSF cytology neg for malignant cells) remained negative, and while he was on the acyclovir, ceftriaxone, vancomycin and ampicillin for meningitis, he was also started on clindamycin, leucovorin and pyrimethamine for possible toxoplasma reactivation (given his past history of infection and neurologic symptoms).
Eventually, urine was positive for enterovirus which is a unifying diagnosis for meningitis and myocarditis.
When his enterovirus csf Pcr was positive, toxoplasma was unlikely so his treatment for this was stopped and he had a repeat MRI to rule out edema or worsening.
Dizziness/Nausea: MRI showed no masses that would be causing dizziness, and this was thought to be [**12-26**] post-meningeal infection.
Per neurology, he will likely have a prolonged course of dizziness and should likely be discharged to vestibular rehabilitation center.
CT scan of chest was performed given concern for increased crackles on exam.
It showed new, mild bronchiolitis in right lower lobe.
The EP/cardiology team reviewed the patient's ECGs, which showed accelerated junctional rhythms and periods of low atrial tachycardia with AV dissociation.
His cardiac MR was negative, and once he was found to have enterovirus this was considered the likely cause for myocarditis.
He had no significant telemetry events, and his troponin level was normal on this admission (elevated on past admission).
Right Upper extremity clot: The patient was noted to have a right cephalic vein thrombosis.
Because of the interval improvement in the clot size, and given his fall risk with dizziness, heparin was discontinued prior to discharge.
CML: S/T Allo-MRD SCT in [**2117**], no evidence of blasts or recurrence.
Depression: Patient has a history of depression with suicide attempts in the past.
Started on Celexa 20mg po qdaily, which he tolerated well with minimal side effects.
Dispo: Patient was discharged to rehabilitation facility given persistent vertigo and unsteadiness on feet.
Meclizine 12.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for dizziness.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Enteroviral ([**Location (un) **] B) meningoencephalitis RUE cephalic vein clot Hypotension Pericarditis/myocarditis .
Secondary diagnosis: Graft versus host disease S/P Allo SCT in [**2117**] for CML   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: 1.
Please call your doctor or return for high fevers, chills, change in mental status, worsened headache, inability to take medications and vomiting.
