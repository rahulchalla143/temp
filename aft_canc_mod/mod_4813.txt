Admission Date:  [**2180-12-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2180-12-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2119-7-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis  History of Present Illness: 61 year old male with GERD, SCLC dx'd [**8-/2180**] and metastatic to the mediastinum and brain, s/p brain radiation and 4 cycles of chemo and begun on thoracic radiation within the last week, who has had an increasing pericardial effusion which was initially noted on CT in [**Month (only) 359**] of this year.
The patient had an echo on [**12-12**] that revealed a large pericardial effusion with possible tamponade physiology.
He was scheduled to come in for elective pericardiocentesis today but awoke with much worse SOB, was BIBA to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
He tolerated the procedure well without complication and a pericardial drain was placed for continued drainage.
In the CCU, he reports not being sure if he is feeling better given his ongoing pain related to the procedure.
Denies significant SOB or dizziness.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Endorses mild pedal edema b/l for the last few days.

NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.

Fluid Culture in Bottles (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a large pericardial effusion measruing 2.5cm around the apex and 2cm along the lateral and distal third of the left ventricle.
There is minimal anterior to the right ventricle and right atrium.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, c/w impaired ventricular filling and increased pericardial pressure/tamponade physiology.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-9-19**], the effusion is larger with increased pericardial pressure/tamponade now suggested.
TTE (s/p drainage): Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is a trivial echodense pericardial effusion, primarily around the RV apex.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-12-12**], pericardial effusion has been successfully drained.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: poor echo windows.
There is a small amount of residual fluid seen.
There is an echodense mass at the apex and lateral wall of the left ventricle (see in particular image #8).
No echo evidence of tamponade.
CXR: IMPRESSION: 1) Findings compatible with interval development of post-obstructive pneumonia and left lower lobe collapse.
2) Known mediastinal mass and right pulmonary nodule.
Brief Hospital Course: 61yo M with SCLC diagnosed in [**8-/2180**] c/b CNS and mediastinal metastases with known prior pericardial effusion, presents with increasing dyspnea, with pericardiocentesis prior to admission to CCU.
# Pericardial effusion: Known small effusion from [**9-/2180**] CT chest.
Increased to moderate size on a recent CT, but then appeared even larger on TTE done on admission with concern for tamponade physiology due to his presenting symptoms.
Fluid studies were notable for large amount of RBCs and protein/LDH ratios that satisfied Light's criteria for exudate.
After the procedure, there was no evidence of tamponade on exam and his blood pressures remained stable.
Though the effusion was reported as loculated, the decision was made to defer a pericardial window at this time due to his comorbidities, good drainage, and symptomatic relief.
His drainage site pain was controlled with long-acting oxycontin and oxycodone for breakthrough.
Follow-up TTEs did not show reaccumulation of the effusion and frequent checks were negative for pulsus paradoxus.
# Healthcare associated pneumonia: Based on the CXR finding of post-obstructive pneumonia and bandemia, we gave levofloxacin for coverage of a presumed pneumonia.
# Anemia: Hct reached a nadir of 24.8.
Since the patient has a large tumor burden and will be getting XRT on the Monday following discharge, Hematology/Oncology recommended transfusion and he was given 1 unit pRBCs prior to discharge with Hct of 26.2.
Disp:*4 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* 4. oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every 4-6 hours as needed for pain for 7 days.
Disp:*42 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Pericardial effusion  Secondary diagnosis: Metastatic small cell lung cancer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted with increasing shortness of breath and an enlarging fluid collection around your heart.
A drain was placed so that the fluid did not re-collect and we gave you medications to help control the pain associated with the procedure.
We have also provided you with some medication to help control your pain around the drainage site.
If you have a recurrence of your symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness/fainting, please be sure to inform your doctors and return to the Emergency Department.
