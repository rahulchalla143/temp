He represented with SOB and underwent bronchoscopy (pre-scheduled) that found large amount of secretion.
After mucous plug removal, his respiratory status improved, but still had dyspnea on exertion and hypoxia down to the 80s.
Pulmonary consult at [**Hospital1 **] recommended discontinuation of the antibiotics if his patchy infiltrate improved.
On the floor, patient reports some dyspnea, especially with exertion, worse with the COPD exacerbation.
He reports having COPD exacerbation requiring up to 3-4L O2, then was sent home on 40 mg prednisone, Levoquin, and O2.
Subsequently returned to hospital because he felt the COPD exacerbation was worse again.
Has been having several months of orthopnea and PND.
He reports chest discomfort with coughing but not with exertion.
Denies palpitation, dizzziness, lightheadedness, or presyncope.
He does not think he has LE edema but was told that he has it in [**Hospital3 **].

Low lung volumes with atelectasis, more on the right, but no definite evidence for pneumonia.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF HOSPITAL SUMMARY 89 yo M with tracheo-bronchomalazcia s/p stents [**8-/2171**], multiple bronchoscopy, s/p tracheostomy [**9-/2172**], s/p tracheal decannulization in [**6-/2173**], COPD, PAF, CAD s/p CABG transferred for [**Year (4 digits) 2742**] of AVR and possible tracheoplasty, neither of which are an option for this patient, per the consulting services.
His COPD exacerbation has been treated and the patient has been stabilized.
ACTIVE ISSUES # COPD exacerbation, potentially [**12-30**] CAP.
Found to have ESBL e. coli on bronchoscopy at OSH.
given history, clinical picture and other underlying comorbidities and allergy to vanc, pt on linezolid and meropenem, w/ symptomatic improvement.
Pt w/ significant crackles and rhonchi.
Sending additional labs regardless (c.diff, ua), but we believe this is most probably the effect of steroid initiations.
We appreciated pulmonology recs, which recommended outpt f/u and no interventions.
Will continue antibiotics for 14 days considering considerable structural disease and potential hospital acquired pneumonia, will finish linezolid on [**10-6**] and meropenem on [**10-7**].
Pt w/ repeat echo (see above) w/ Avalve 1-1.2cm, and no immediate plan for plasty or repair by cardiology.
Pt w/ mild crackles b/l but no elevated JVP.
No LE edema.
# Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation.
# dCHF.
Pt w/ crackles, rhonchi b/l but no elevated JVP.
H/o CABG in [**2156**], cardiac cath in [**2167**] with thrombotic occlusion of the venous graft to D1, but not suitable for intervention.
Pt had chest pain w/ exertion in ICU, w/ hypotension 150 --> 90 w/ nitro sublingual.
if pt has CP, be cautious use of nitro, as pt became hypotensive.
# TBM.
No hypoxia on 4L.
Seen by interventional pulm, and no indication for intervention.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: primary diagnosis: COPD exacerbation secondary to bacterial pneumonia secondary diagnoses: CAD, atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 31205**],  You were admitted to our hospital for a COPD exacerbation which was most likely caused by a bacterial pneumonia.
As you know, you have significant structural disease in your lungs.
