He also has been c/o chest pain that started mostly today, in the anterior left chest just lateral to his sternum.
He reports the pain as sharp, and approximately [**2122-4-16**].
His narcotics have been helping with his chronic back pain.
Patient improved to mid 90s on 3-4L, but had occasional desaturations which improved with intermittent NRB.
CP with mild improvement with dilaudid; nitro SL without any benefit.
Cardiology contact[**Name (NI) **] but did not feel there was any acute issue for them to resolve at this time, especially given poor long term prognosis.
Metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma.
An MRI of the lumbar spine on [**2119-10-20**] was notable for a massive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
A CT torso on [**2119-10-23**] confirmed these findings along with supraclavicular lymphadenopathy and a large conglomerate lymph node mass in the periaortic location 10 x 5 cm.
MRI of the head on [**2119-11-1**] was  negative for disease.
On [**2119-11-7**], an excisional biopsy of the  left supraclavicular node was consistent with metastatic papillary adenocarcinoma - positive for CD10 and PAX2, negative for CK7, CK 20, thyroglobulin, and TTF-1; it was felt most likely to be renal in origin.
PET-CT on [**2119-11-27**] showed multiple FDG avid lymph nodes in the left cervical, mediastinal, hilar and retroperitoneal regions.
MRI abdomen on [**2119-11-30**] was notable for a 3.0 x 2.5 cm mass in the lower pole of the left kidney.
He had increasing pain, developed pleural effusions and had significant side effect from the sunitinib including nausea, vomiting, poor appetite and diarrhea so it was stopped on [**2120-4-24**].
He is currently on a leave of absence due to his back pain and malignancy.

Dypsnea: Likely in the setting of worsening malignant pleural effusion ([**2120-5-22**] pleural fluid cytology with malignant cells).
Given pleural nodularity and lobulation, most likely c/w malignant pleural effusion.
Patient was given furosemide 20 mg IV to see if there is any improvement with mild diuresis even though no evidence of overt heart failure and no documented ECHO previously.
Interventional pulmonary was consulted for placement of pleurex catheter on right side for symptomatic relief.
Chest Pain: Patient has had chest pain similar to this during previous hospitalization, though per patient, this time seems worse.
Although cardiac cause is possible, there is no evidence of acute ECG changes at this time.
Likely, chest pain secondary to lung disease, mets, and/or pleural effusions.
Pain was eventually determined to be non-cardiac and was managed with Dilaudid.
He was started on oxycontin for long-acting pain relief with dilaudid for pain relief.
Adjustments were made for pain relief and mental alertness/oversedation.
Patient was stabilized on current regimen(oxycontin 60mg qam and noon, 80mg qpm with 4-12mg Po dilaudid q2h for breakthrough pain) several days prior to discharge and should remain on this regimen.
He was also started on ritalin 2.5mg qam and noon for increased mental alertness given sedating effects of narcotics.
However, due to increased swelling he was started on coumadin with a Lovenox bridge.
No evidence of seizure activity during hospitalization.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Last Name (un) 14710**] House (Hospice Home) - [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic renal cell carcinoma  Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable and afebrile.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for difficulty breathing.
It was found that the difficulty breathing was due to fluid in your right lung.
In addition, if you feel short of breath, or feel like you need to increase your oxygen because of difficulty breathing, you should ask that the catheter be drained.
Per IP, he can drain the catheter as frequently as he becomes symptomatic.
If he becomes short of breath, he should drain the catheter rather than increasing his oxygen requirement to relieve his symptoms.
Can drain as often as once daily, but will need to monitor closely for hypovolemia if he is requiring daily drainage.
