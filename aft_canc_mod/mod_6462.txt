Admission Date:  [**2154-9-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-9-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2106-3-2**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**] Chief Complaint: Biliary sepsis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP with plastic stent placement PICC line placement ERCP with 8 mm x 80 mm Biliary Wallflex stent placement into the hilum and left intrahepatic system  History of Present Illness: 48 yo W w PMH of HTN, DM who underwent CT-guided biopsy of newly diagnosed liver mass on [**2154-9-6**].
Otherwise, without complaints.
Denies history of hepatitis or recent travel.
Past Medical History: HTN Hyperlipidemia Type II DM GERD PSH: Appy   Social History: Pt quit tobacco 13 years ago; total 15 pk year history.
No good evidence for intrathoracic malignancy.
A 4 mm left upper lobe nodule is the only candidate for metastasis.
Small right and tiny left pleural effusions are probably due to volume overload or migration of ascites.
Subpleural cyst or old abscess or infarct, right lung, do not warrant followup, unless patient is symptomatic.
Infiltrative hepatic mass which surrounds the IVC and appears to obliterate the right and middle hepatic veins as well as the right posterior portal vein.
There is relative preservation of the left lobe of the liver from this mass, although portions of the dominant mass extends contiguously into the left lobe.
Marked intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Moderate ascites.
Moderate right-sided pleural effusion and atelectasis; trace left-sided pleural effusion and atelectasis.
DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Approved: SAT [**2154-9-14**] 11:00 PM  Cytology Report PERITONEAL FLUID Procedure Date of [**2154-9-16**] Peritoneal fluid:   NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Reactive mesothelial cells, histiocytes and lymphocytes.
Scattered clusters of highly atypical cells with   increased nuclear:cytoplasmic ratios and irregular   nuclear contours, suspicious for adenocarcinoma.
Brief Hospital Course: 48 year old female with DM, HTN, and recently found liver mass, transferred from OSH with hypotension, bandemia, hypoglycemia, ARF likely secondary to sepsis after recent liver biopsy.
Hyperbilirubinemia/hepatic failure/liver mass:  Patient presented with painless jaundice, significant hyperbilirubinemia and was also known to have a liver mass.
She had had a liver biopsy done at [**Hospital3 10377**] hospital prior to admission with results reportedly demonstrating fibrosis only.
On admission, with above presentation, concern for carcinoma, hepatocellular versus cholangiocarcinoma.
She also underwent a triple phase CT scan of abdomen/pelvis that demonstrated tumor throughout right lobe, extending into left lobe of the liver, as well as infiltrating the vena cava, and some enlarged lymph nodes.
Evaluation included large volume paracenteses with ascitic fluid sent for cytology which returned negative.
However, upon evaluation of extent of liver metastasis, it was determined that the patient was not a surgical candidate for her cancer.
Social work was consulted for assistance with coping with her new diagnosis of cancer, and the fact that she was not a candidate for surgery.
Sepsis, now resolved: On presentation, patient had elevated WBC count with bandemia, and was hypotensive, consistent with sepsis.
Infectious source thought to be hepatobiliary given severe jaundice and recent instrumentation of liver biopsy prior to presentation.
Also concern for MRSA with recent hospitalization and right lower lobe infiltrate versus effusion seen on chest x-ray.
Blood pressure and symptoms stabilized and patient was transferred to the floor, and she remained well throughout remainder of hospital course.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] her WBC was still elevated at discharge, she was discharged on a seven day course of levofloxacin, as recommended by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 79848**] from ERCP.
Concern for hepatic failure initially, but then resolved, and therefore was likely to sepsis and oral agents in the setting of acute renal failure.
She declined to continue her metformin given her hepatic process which seems reasonable.
OSH urine culture with no growth.
Urine culture no growth.
# Acute renal failure: FeNa of 1.9 initially suggested ATN consistent with hypotension.
# HTN: Anti hypertensives held during hospital course  # GERD: maintained on PPI  Medications on Admission: Protonix Flonase (Following recently discontinued) HCTZ Benicar Tricor Amaryl Lantus 30 U Metformin  Discharge Medications: 1.
Fluticasone 50 mcg/Actuation Spray, Suspension Sig: [**11-28**] sprays Nasal [**Hospital1 **] PRN as needed for Postnasal drip.
Disp:*7 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Cholangiocarcinoma Obstructive jaundice s/p metallic stent placement  Secondary: HTN Diabetes type 2 uncontrolled   Discharge Condition: Good.
Patient without pain, tolerating PO, ambulating without difficulty.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with jaundice and liver masses, as well as sepsis (severe infection with low blood pressure).
Your infection was treated and your jaundice and liver masses were worked up and determined to be cholangiocarcinoma.
