Brief Hospital Course: 69 yo woman with ho Stage III esophogeal carcinoma on day 6 of cycle 2 of cisplatin/5-FU, presents with nausea, fatigue, poor PO intake.
# Esophagitis: Patient with signicant esophagitis.
In setting of radiation tx, thrombocytopenia, pt vomitted 150cc of frank bloody emesis and was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for observation.
Pt was transfused 1 unit PRBCs and 3 units platelets and an EGD showed erosive esophagitis, likely radiation induced.
# Pancytopenia: Pt with severe thrombocytopenia requiring multiple transfusions of platelets, PRBCs, and was started on neupogen which resolved her neutropenia.
# Nausea: Most likely combination of cisplatinum chemotoxicity causing central nausea along with constipation possibly induced by narcotics and zofran.
Pt is afebrile and without other sx or signs of infection.
# CP: Most likely caused by esophogitis given association with eating and resolution with GI coctail.
# Dehydration: Most likely due to poor PO intake mostly related to chemotoxicity and dysphagia and probable component of esophogeal malignancy.
# Hypokalemia/Hypomagnesemia: Persisted despite resolution of nausea/vomitting, likely secondary to chemotoxicity.
