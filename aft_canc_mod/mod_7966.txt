Admission Date:  [**2153-10-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-10-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2081-10-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Allergies/ADRs on File  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath, orthopnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis   History of Present Illness: 71 yo male with history of COPD, probable lung cancer and known pericardial effusion presents with worsening shortness of breath and orthopnea.
He was found to have early tamponade physiology on echocardiogram report from [**Hospital6 1129**] [**2153-9-12**] where echo revealed LV ejection fraction of 76% and a moderate to  large circumferential pericardial effusion with fibrin deposition  and impaired RV filling consistent with early tamponade physiology in setting of estimated PASP 36 mmHg.
His lung cancer diagnosis was suspected based on imaging findings and smoking history though he declined biopsy and future treatment if he did have pathologic diagnosis.
He reports 10 pound weight loss and new onset paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea as well as episodic loose melena.
He has had no recent falls but that he still is very unstable due to his back problems and occasional vertigo.
he complained of worsening SOB, heart racing, unclear story of chest pain - most currently no chest pain, He denies pain in his back neck or jaw.
He also endorses chronic abdominal pain times several months that is intermittent he has right now.
No fever chills nausea or vomiting.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No thrills, lifts.
Pulsus 6 mmHg LUNGS: Diminished BS bilateral bases, no crackles, or wheezes ABDOMEN: +BS Soft, distended, tender diffusely, no R/G.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to       hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..     FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2153-10-4**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):     FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
Pericardial Fluid Cytology: Wetread - Malignant cells .
ECG [**10-2**]: Atrial fibrillation.
Low voltage throughout the tracing.
Consider anterior wall myocardial infarction of indeterminate age.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
CXR Portable [**10-2**]: IMPRESSION: Opacification of the right middle lobe which may represent atelectasis versus possible pneumonia.
Small right pleural effusion.
ABD XR [**10-2**]: FINDINGS: AP and left lateral decubitus radiographs of the abdomen were provided.
There is a nonobstructive bowel gas pattern and there is no free air.
There is a meniscus seen in the right chest which is presumably mobile pleural effusion.
The previously seen right middle lobe opacity on the recent prior chest radiograph has resolved suggesting that this was due to atelectasis.
Targetoid lesion measuring 1.8 cm in the right lobe of the liver is concerning for malignancy, including metastatic disease.
Echogenic liver compatible with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of more severe liver disease, including hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis are not excluded on this study.
Pericardial effusion with echo evidence of tamponade 2.
There is a very small pericardial effusion located adjacent to the right atrial free wall.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Stable appearing post- obstructive RML collapse and likely also atx involving RLL.
Small right pleural effusion likely unchanged.
Cannot exclude supervening infection in teh right lower lung in the appropriate clinical setting.
Left lung and right upper lobe clear.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 yo male with history of COPD, AFib, dCHF, probable lung cancer, and known pericardial effusion presents with worsening shortness of breath, orthopnea, and tamponade s/p pericardial drainage.
ACTIVE ISSUES: #Malignant Pericardial Effusion and Tamponade: Presented with worsening effusion causing radiographic tamponade.
Final cell block interpretation was pending at time of discharge.
#Probable lung cancer: Review of chest CT from [**Hospital1 2025**] showed large bronchogenic lesion causing complete collapse of the right middle lobe as well as multiple hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes.
He has declined biopsy, further staging, or treatment.
#Abdominal pain: he expressed mild abdominal discomfort not requiring opiate medications.
An abdominal US showed liver lesions likely metastases in this context.
CHRONIC ISSUES: .
#Diastolic CHF: Had mild pleural effusion but otherwise does not appear volume overloaded.
#COPD: Did not appear to be in COPD exacerbation.
During this hospitalization, Mr. [**Known lastname 105142**] was not amenable to further staging workup including brain imaging, bronchoscopy for biospies, or further body imaging.
2. simethicone 125 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for Bloating.
3. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Pericardial effusion .
You were admitted for shortness of breath which was a result of a large amount of fluid surrouding your heart.
You are also short of breath because part of your lung is deflated.
This is because you have a mass compressing your lung.
If you have worsening of your shortness of breath or change your mind about further work up of your cancer you should discuss this with your primary care doctor or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
