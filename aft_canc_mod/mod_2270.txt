Admission Date:  [**2101-11-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-12-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2038-9-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Penicillins / Cephalosporins / Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6075**] Chief Complaint: dizziness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation and mechanical ventilation tracheostomy and PEG tube placement broncheoalveolar lavage bronchoscopy x 2  History of Present Illness: 63yo man with PMH significant for CAD, HTN, DM, who had complaints of sinus infection x 5-6 days for which he was started on mucinex and Zithromax x 1 dose two days prior to admission, presented as a transfer from an OSH with dizziness and numbness.
He also complained of constant headache on the right side of his head, not throbbing, without visual changes, nausea or vomiting.
A short time later, he got up to go back to bed and became acutely dizzy (lightheadedness) and had a sense of disequilibrium, walking like a "drunken sailor."
There were no symptoms of vertigo.
He presented to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital ED and was found to have episodes of bradycardia, which was felt to be associated with the episodes of dizziness.
He would have episodes of sudden bradycardic epsidoes with accompanying jaw pain and lightheadedness, resolving when the heart rate increased.
An EKG showed nonspecific ST changes.
At 8:35PM, the nurse reported that he had difficulty swallowing and decreased sensation to his right face.
An MRI showed an old frontal defect.
At 1:10AM, he complained of persistent right sided numbness of his face, arm, and leg.
He says that he has a pins-and-needles sensation, which has been improved since its onset.
ROS was negative for fevers/chills, no SOB, chest pain, abdominal pain, or dysuria.

Pertinent Results: Admission labs: 144  107  28 -------------<160 4.0  25  1.0 Ca: 9.3 Mg: 2.2 P: 2.7 Cholesterol:124 Triglyc: 78 HDL: 43 CHOL/HD: 2.9 LDLcalc: 65 PT: 31.4  INR: 3.3 Cardiac enzymes negative x 3  Imaging: BRAIN MRI [**11-19**]: Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of slow diffusion to indicate acute infarct.
There is an area of low signal visualized within the right side of the medulla and cervicomedullary junction on susceptibility-weighted images.
This area demonstrates isointense signal to the brain with areas of hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images.
There is also mild diffuse increased signal seen within the medulla and the upper cervical spinal cord at this level.
There are mild changes of small vessel disease seen in the periventricular white matter with chronic lacunes in the left periventricular white matter.
There are no territorial infarcts seen.
There is no mass effect, midline shift, or hydrocephalus.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarct.
The abnormalities seen within the right side of the medulla and upper cervical cord has signal characteristics which is more compatible with a cavernous malformation with surrounding edema in the cervicomedullary junction.
MRA OF THE NECK [**11-19**]: No significant abnormalities on MRA of the neck with and without gadolinium.
CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST [**11-22**]: No new areas of intracranial hemorrhage are identified.
There is a tiny focus of increased density within the left parietal region which likely represents volume averaging between sulci (series 2, image 24).
Ventricles are symmetric, and there is no shift of normally midline structures.
There has been no interval increase in the caliber of the ventricles.
There is an area of increased density within the right medulla, which corresponds to area of abnormality seen on the recent MRI.
There is no definite supratentorial or cerebellar tonsillar herniation.
IMPRESSION: Again seen is an area of increased density within the right medulla which corresponds to the cavernous malformation better evaluated on the recent MRI study.
There is no definite evidence of herniation on this study.
No new areas of intracranial hemorrhage are identified.
Brief Hospital Course: General: 63yo man who presented to OSH with 2 days of LH/dysequilibrium and falling to the right, found to have junctional rhythm that correlated with LH, but was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after acute development of right sided paresthesias, slurred speech, and difficulty swallowing.
Exam was notable initially for upgaze and lateral nystagmus, dyarthria, right ataxic hemiparesis, left hemibody numbness and bifacial numbness.
While in the ICU, his strength worsened and an MRI showed hemorrhage in the right medulla consistent with a cavernous angioma.
He remained mentally clear, however, he had significant secretions and had increasing difficulty protecting his airway.
Around the same time, he became hypoxic and required intubation for airway protection.
Peri-intubation he was acidotic and had a brief episode of SVT with associated hypotension.
This resolved spontaneously with restoration of his blood pressure.
After intubation, he was suctioned for copious thick secretions and was presumed to have an aspiration pneumonia for which he was treated empirically with levofloxacin.
The coverage was broadened to include vancomycin and flagyl when he developed a high fever (103.8) the day after intubation.
He had a head CT which did not show any evidence of herniation.
Gradually improved neurologically with mental status intact, antigravity strength of right upper and lower extremity and improved extraoccular movements with only mild impairment bilaterally (right worse than left) and some right sided nystagmus.
CVS: Had several episodes SVT requiring cardioversion with chemical or electrical.
Some pulmonary congestion and effusions during his last week, and was thus on Lasix Drip and now lasix 40mg IV BID.
See bleow for course:- intubated - extubated [**11-23**] - reintubated [**11-24**] - increased work of breathing/acidosis -> reintubated, likely aspiration (gross aspiration during S&S eval), significant yellow sputum.
Also effusions and significant pulm edema.
Pleural Tap from [**12-7**] with 2+PMNs but nor orgs and no growth Off ABX for 24 hrs and was afebrile with normal white count on d/c.
ID - Initially had sinusitis and completed ABX.
Most recently completed 7 days cipro/vanc and afebrile for >5 days now.
Endo: on RISS  Renal - BUN slightly increased as has had lasix drip and IV lately.
No other renal issues.
Cortisone 1 % Cream [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Appl Topical  QID (4 times a day) as needed for psoriasis.
Clonazepam 0.5 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: half tab Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] Northeast - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right lateral medullary syndrome secondary to hemorrhage of medullary cavernous angioma  Needs Piccline placed and then central line removed after picc placed.
