History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 14502**] is a 71yo man with HTN, COPD, and metastatic rectal cancer to the bones admitted from clinic for upper back and bilateral rib pain.
His pain has worsened over the last one week since restarting capecitabine.
He also has similar pain in the front of his chest.
ROS: He notes anorexia and night sweats.
He has chronic numbness in his feet.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: # Early stage lung cancer status post right upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection in [**2134-9-6**] without evidence of recurrence.
- [**2141-9-6**]: the pt develops abdominal pain and lower GI bleed, further investigation by colonoscopy reveals an ulcerated 4-5 cm mass in the mid rectum at 10cm, the pathology examination of the biopsies shows poorly differentiated carcinoma.
- [**2142-3-7**]: the patient undergoes low anterior resection and diverting loop ileostomy and mesenteric and periaortic lymphadenectomy (T3N2M0, [**8-17**] lymph nodes involved, with a distal margin that was clear by < 1 mm, k-RAS wild time) after completion of neo-adjuvant capecitabine-based chemoradiation - [**5-14**] the patient started adjuvant therapy with FLOX (5-FU + leucovorin 500 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, and 15 and oxaliplatin 85 mg on day 1,5 of four-week cycles).
- [**2142-7-7**] bone scan and spine MRI showed multiple bone metastasis, in [**2143-6-6**] a bone scan and now CT scan torso showed progression of bone metastates, but no evidence of other site of metastatic disease.
- [**2143-7-24**] start palliative chemotherapy with single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] Irinotecan (350 mg/m2 q21d).
- [**2143-10-9**] CT TORSO showed increased sclerotic bony metastatic disease unclear if due to disease progression or response to treatment.
*C2D1 changed from [**6-10**] to [**6-12**] due to development of abdominal pain and nausea.
Urgent CT demonstrated nonocclusive thrombus of left renal vein and interval enlargement of sclerotic focus in left aspect of T12.
CT demonstrated small bowel thickening suggestive of enteritis.
*Hospitalized [**Date range (1) 101703**] for weakness, abdominal pain, and increased ostomy output and dehydration.
CT revealed epiploic appendagitis.
[**5-/2144**]: Restarted capecitabine.
Family History: Unremarkable for colorectal or other malignancy.
Neck: Supple, no thyromegaly, no JVD.
CV: S1S2, reg rate and rhythm, no MRG.
Chest pain not reproducible by palpation.
CHEST: Markedly tender bilateral ribs, large asymmetry/mass at right posterior ribs at thoracotomy scar.
ABD: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, no HSM.
EXTR: No edema, calf tenderness, or finger clubbing.
Neuro: Strength 5/5, sensation to touch diminished at feet, down-going plantar reflexes, no focal deficits.
Significant progression of metastatic lesions involving the thoracic and visualized lumbar spine since the previous MRI from [**2142-7-30**].
Multiple sclerotic deposits are demonstrated throughout the thoracic spine with diffuse involvement at multiple sites.
Large epidural deposit causing cord compression is demonstrated at T1 level.
Several other epidural deposits are seen, most prominent at T9 and T12 levels.
Interval worsening of extensive osseous metastasis, most prominently noted along the right rib cage, with expansile osseous and soft tissue components.
Small right pleural effusion.
Worsening of multilevel osseous metastases in the spine as described.
No acute pathologic fracture.
Unchanged small parastomal hernia, but without bowel obstruction at the loop ileostomy in the right lower quadrant.
Multiple sclerotic metastases in the cervical, visualized thoracic and lumbar spine.
Large epidural mass at T1 causing severe cord compression as seen on the earlier thoracic spine study.
Small epidural deposit at T12 level indenting the dorsal aspect of the distal cord as seen on the recent thoracic spine study.
Small posterior epidural deposits at L2-3 and L3-4 levels without canal compromise.
Minor degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine with disc bulges, small protrusions and facet arthropathy causing foraminal narrowing.
[**2144-5-28**] MRI BRAIN: IMPRESSION: Sclerotic bony metastatic lesions are identified in both frontal bones and left temporal bone with dural enhancement adjacent to the bony metastases in the right frontal and left temporal regions.
Sclerotic metastatic disease to the spinous process of C2 is also noted, which was observed on the cervical spine MRI of [**2144-5-27**].
No brain parenchymal metastasis is seen.
[**2144-5-29**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Lung volumes are slightly lower, but lungs are clear of any focal abnormality.
Blastic bone lesions in the ribs and the thoracic spine have increased substantially.
There is no pneumonia or pulmonary edema or even appreciable pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
DISCHARGE LABS:  Brief Hospital Course: 71yo man with HTN, COPD, and metastatic rectal CA admitted for back and bilateral rib pain.
Pain improved with IV hydromorphone.
After surgery, he developed atrial fibrillation, which was controlled with metoprolol.
He was not anticoagulated because of the recent neurosrugery.
# Back and rib pain and T1 cord compression:  MRI T-SPINE showed severe T1 cord compression.
# Atrial fibrillation: Developed after surgery and controlled with increased doses of metoprolol.
Not anticoagulated because of recent neurosurgery.A chest CTA was done and was neagtive fo ra PE.
# COPD: Continued albuterol/ipratropium and fluticasone/salmeterol.
# BPH: Continued tamsulosin.
# Depression: Continued citalopram.
IV fluids given for decreased PO and clinical dehydration.
# CODE: FULL.
