Left Upper Extremity Derm biopsy Leukemia cutis, see note.
Note: The section shows papillary dermal edema, marked extravasated red blood cells, and exuberant perivascular and dermal mononuclear infiltrate.
The perivascular cells are atypical and contain large nuclei, conspicuous nucleoli, irregular nuclear membranes, dark chromatin and have eosinophilic cytoplasm.
Given the above histomorphology and immunophenotype, the findings are compatible with leukemia cutis.

Brief Hospital Course: 74M with MDS transformed to AML, complicated clinical course including multifocal pneumonia in the setting of neutropenia.
# Acute Myelogenous Leukemia: MDS transformed to AML.
He was then initiated on daunorubicin and ara-C, he had an anaphylactic reaction about 15 minutes into the ara-C therapy, and a code blue was called, although no compressions or intubation were performed.
The patient was then transferred back to the floor and had decitabine therapy for 5 days, without significant decrease in blast count.
Allergy was consulted and recommended a protocol for desensitization to ara-C, but it was felt that the risks of this protocol outweighed the limited benefit.
He developed leukemia cutis.
# Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia seen on CT chest and subsequent CXRs are consistent with progression of disease.
# Neutropenic Fever: Mr [**Known lastname **] continued to spike fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, as discussed above in multifocal pna.
# Acute Kidney Failure: FeNa was consistent with intrinsic renal failure.
A possible etiology of his renal failure was his leukemia.
# Early tamponade / pericardial effusion: The patient presented to the CCU with fatigue, DOE.
post-drain echo did not show fluid but showed hyperdynamic septum.
Interval (post-drain) echocardiograms showed no reaccumulation of fluid in the pericardial space.
He was already being covered with vancomycin at this time for neutropenic fever, as discussed elsewhere.
# Lower Extremity Edema: Pt also appears to have mild diastolic dysfunction.
# Pancytopenia: Secondary to AML and cytoreductive therapy.
# Anaphylaxis to Cytarabine: resolved.
He had acute worsening of his baseline shortness of breath likely secondary to bronchospasm after he received danorubicin and cytarabine (likely cytarabine as the causative [**Doctor Last Name 360**]).
# Leukemia Cutis: confirmed on biopsy.
# RUE DVT: PICC associated and thrombocytopenia precludes treatment, but high risk for infection so was monitored closely.
