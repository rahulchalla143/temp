Admission Date:  [**2143-12-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2143-12-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2082-5-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Clindamycin / Keflex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**] Chief Complaint: hemoptysis/post-obstructive pneumonia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IR embolization of bleeding pulmonary site  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 51305**] is a 61 year old male smoker with 50 pack year history, COPD, hemachromatosis, and multiple invasive squamous cell carcinoma/basal cell carcinoma who is being transferred to the ICU for post-procedural monitoring following rigid bronchoscopy for hemoptysis and likely post obstructive pneumonia.
He initially presented who had an episode of hemoptysis and shortness of breath in the early AM prior to presenting to the OSH.
Patient reports that he had 2 episodes of hemoptysis of approximately [**5-22**] oz.
There, he underwent a CT scan that showed a mass obstructing the left main stem bronchus with a post obstructive pneumonia on the left.
Patient reports a diminished appetite, and 25 weight loss of the past 6-8 weeks.
Patient reports that he has difficulty walking greater than 50 feet before he becomes short of breath and develops calf pain.
Of note, he has a major history of numerous squamous cell carcinomas of the bilateral frontal and parietal scalp, probably due to excessive sun exposure.
He receives dermatologic care here at [**Hospital1 18**] from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] is to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**] for a Mohs procedure of a recurrent left temporal lesion.
He believes that he has melanoma of the left temporal region though this was not demonstrated by recent pathology.
With a CXR demonstrating major left lower lobe collapse and likely obstruction of the LMSB, decision was made to go directly to OR for rigid bronchoscopy with subsequent MICU admission for observation.
His bronchoscopy revealed a large blood clot in the left main stem bronchus with a malignancy of 10% stenosis behind it.
There were multiple tumors in the airways of both LUL and LLL, each of which were cauterized with good effect.
Distal slow oozing was seen in smaller airways NOT amenable to bronchoscopic intervention.
IP recommended IR for angiography/embolization in the AM.
He was comfortable without complaints, though was still drowsy from anesthesia and a ROS could not be ellicited  Past Medical History: -Hemochromatosis -COPD -PVD -HTN -lymphedema of LUE, RLE -IBS -anxiety -invasive squamous cell carcinoma of left temple.
Family History: Mother: CAD, DM Father Siblings [**Name (NI) **]: DM, CAD  Physical Exam: Admission exam Vitals: T: BP:150/65 P:76 R:18 O2:100% 2Lventuri mask General: patient is fatigued-appearing and weak.
Multiple scaling lesions over the frontal and parietal scalp bilaterlly, with an ulcerated lesion over the left temple.
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: Decreased breath sounds on the left with rhonchi, no wheezes, rales, ronchi Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, asymmetric 2+ pitting edema with L arm >> R, and R leg >> left.
PATHOLOGY REPORT OF LUNG MASS SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: right lower lobe endobronchial bx.
Note:  The patient's history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is noted.
Although the endobronchial tumor may represent metastasis from a cutaneous primary, a primary lung squamous cell carcinoma cannot be excluded.
CT Head [**2143-12-16**] There is no evidence of hemorrhage, infarction, shift of midline structures, or mass effect.
Several tiny calcifications in the left frontal lobe (2:18, 2:11)and right frontal lobe (2:14) may be sequelae of old infection.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process, including large metastasis.
If metastasis continue to be a clinical concern, then an MR is recommended for further evaluation.
LENIs [**2143-12-16**] No DVT in the right lower extremity.
Mild subcutaneous edema and calcifications within the arterial vessels.
CXR [**2143-12-16**] Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates marked opacification of the left middle and lower lung with significant volume loss as evidenced by marked leftward cardiomediastinal shift.
As correlated to the preceding reference CT from [**Hospital 882**] Hospital of the same day, there is significant endobronchial material obstructing the left main bronchus.
There is likely a combination of consolidation, bronchial wall thickening, and pleural effusion in the left lung as well as volume loss, producing the overall opacification.
There is evidence of underlying emphysema, without radiographic evidence of pneumothorax.
Findings consistent with left main bronchial obstruction with left middle and lower lobe collapse, in addition to consolidation, bronchial wall thickening, and large left pleural effusion.
Overall constellations are highly concerning for malignancy, although supervening infection and/or aspiration may be present.
Single bronchial artery visualized supplying the left lung with visualized tumor blush, embolized utilizing 500-700 micron Embospheres.
Post-embolization arteriogram did not demonstrate any bronchial arteries either originating from the aorta or the internal mammary artery supplying the left lung.
Despite the suggestion that there is an additional left bronchial arterial branch on the CT, this could not be found despite using a number of different catheter shapes.
However, extensive opacification persists and there is still shift of the mediastinum to the left with hyperexpansion of the right lung.
Hazy opacification at the right base raises the possibility of some atelectasis and effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 51305**] is a 61yoM with multiple squamous cell skin cancers who presents with hemoptysis and a LLL post obstructive pneumonia.
# HEMOPTYSIS:  CXR and CT suggested tumor burden in the left mainstem bronchus, and this likely explained his hemoptysis.
He was brought for rigid bronchoscopy, which showed a large tumor burden with distal oozing not amenable to bronchoscopic engagement.
Pathology report from this procedure showed this tumor to be squamous cell, although could not differentiate between metastasis from skin squamous cell cancer vs primary lung squamous cell cancer.
However, he did continue to have intermittent hemoptysis, and overall felt very poorly and mildly SOB.
His pain control was morphine drip initially, and then he was later transitioned to a fentanyl patch and PO pain control.
# COMMUNITY ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA (?POST-OBSTRUCTIVE):  His imaging showed complete collapse of the LLL with a mass compromising the left mainstem bronchus as well as likely consolidation of the inferior LUL.
His sputum cultures grew out moraxella + s. pneumo.
# SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA:  He has an invasive left temporal SCC and possible airway metastases.
# PERIPHERAL ARTERY DISEASE:  Plavix was stopped; the only medications that were continued were those that ensured the patient's comfort.
# CHRONIC LYMPHEDEMA:  asymmetric upper and lower extremity from unclear source.
Medications on Admission: -Percocet -plavix -trazodone -diovan -spiriva -ventolin  Discharge Medications: pt passed away  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: obstructing mass in airway basal cell/squamous cell carcinoma  Secondary Diagnosis: COPD  Discharge Condition: Expired  Discharge Instructions: Patient was made [**Name (NI) 3225**] and expired on [**2142-12-21**] at 7:45am.
