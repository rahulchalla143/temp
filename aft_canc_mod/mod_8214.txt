Admission Date:  [**2141-6-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2141-7-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-6-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3256**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from [**Hospital1 **] with necrotizing pancreatitis and ARDS  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Mechanical ventilation/ intubation x2   History of Present Illness: EAST HOSPITAL MEDICINE ATTENDING ADMISSION NOTE  Date: [**2141-7-3**] Time: 04:13  The patient is a Pt is a 70F with PMH of HTN, PVD and [**Hospital **] transferred from outside hospital with severe pancreatitis and respiratory failure requiring intubation.
The family denies any fevers, cough or chills and states she was in her normal state of health prior to developing pain.
She did not want to go see her MD, but one day prior to transfer her pain worsened and she finally went to [**Hospital6 **].
RUQ US revealed common bile duct dilitation and an abnormal appearance of her pancreas.
Initial plan was for ERCP however the afternoon of transfer the patient developed an acute desaturation event to 88% on 5L NC.
Of note [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] records the patient has a history of chronic nausea and intolerance of greasy food, however the family denies any previous diagnosis of gallbladder disease.
She was extubated on [**2141-6-20**] and was transfered to the medicine floor and was treated for VAP from [**Date range (3) 112125**] with zosyn and vancomycin (cipro was started initially, but subsequently discontinued).
On [**2141-6-23**], she was transfered back to the ICU, re-intubated for hypoxia thought to be due to atelectasis, bilateral pleural effusions and a questionable infarct in the [**Date Range **] without thrombus, which was not anticoagulated.
On [**2141-6-24**], she was noted to have ARF with rare eos (AIN), which was thought to be due to medications/contrast dye exposure.
A LUQ u/s showed no gallstones and minimal sludge.

Extensive necrotizing pancreatitis without gas formation.
Peripancreatic inflammatory fat stranding and free fluid in the retroperitoneum, pelvis and perihepatic locations.
Distended gallbladder with sludge and possibly stones, though no ductal dilatation is seen.
No evidence of choledocholithiasis or definite cholecystitis at this time.
Rounded heterogeneous segment II liver lesion without correlation to CT two days prior.
This could be focal fatty sparing but other lesions such as FNH could be missed on CT in equilibrium phase.
Echogenic liver is most consistent with fatty deposition.
More advanced liver disease such as fibrosis or cirrhosis can not be excluded on this study.
Redemonstration of necrotizing pancreatitis with unchanged distribution of pancreatic necrosis.
Interval increase in peripancreatic fluid around on the tail of the pancreas and gastric greater curvature, but fluid collections do not appear organized.
Moderate nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No thrombus is identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of bilateral lower extremity DVT.
[**2141-6-27**]: renal US: IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis.
CT chest from [**6-25**] Pulmonary nodules measuring up to 7 mm, for which a followup CT in three to six months is recommended if the patient is high risk for malignancy and 6 to 12 months if low risk for malignancy based on [**Last Name (un) 8773**] study guidance.
Most likely gallstone pancreatitis though LFT pattern not c/w prolonged obstruction.
ERCP was deferred during acute disease state given that no obstructing stones were identified on CT and RUQ U/S.
After acute disease state resolves, she will require lap cholecystectomy or ERCP with sphincterotomy (in 2-3months).
Initial episode of respiratory failure was thought to be due to ARDS, as well as bilateral effusions and some vascular congestion, suggesting volume overload in the setting of aggressive volume resuscitation.
Within 24hrs, she developed worsening mental status and increased work of breathing.
After intubation, a bronchoscopy was performed that did not reveal any evidence of lobar infiltrate consistent with aspiration or pna.
A CTA was performed that revealed relative [**Name (NI) 20534**] of [**Name (NI) **] consistent with ischemic changes, but no thrombus was identified.
LENIs were performed and did not demonstrate any evidence of clot and echo did not show right heart strain.
She was also noted to have persistent bilateral pleural effusions.
She was extubated on [**2141-6-28**], and approximately 15min after, she developed stridor and increased wob.
Chest X-ray showed improvement in bilateral effusion despite persistent ataelectasis.
Ventilator associated pneumonia: On [**2141-6-20**], she developed worsening fevers and increased sputum production.
Other sources of infection were investigated (normal U/A, abdomen imaging unchanged, no diarrhea), so she was empirically treated for VAP with vancomycin, zosyn and ciprofloxicin.
No current evidence of infectious process  #.
Acute renal failure: Thought to be AIN after being exposed to cipro and zosyn, both of which can cause AIN.
Renal U/S was performed and did not reveal any signs of hydronephrosis.
Tachycardia: Improved with treatment of acute disease and with restarting her home verapamil and metoprolol (PCP confirmed that both are for hypertension).
She responded well however complained of increased insomnia.
Resolution of hypoglycemia achieved with D5W and holding insulin.
Peripheral Vascular Disease: - Continue home dose of ASA  # Anemia: Hct on admission in the 40's, now 23.
