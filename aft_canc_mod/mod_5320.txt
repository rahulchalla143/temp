[**2-1**] HBV, HCV viral load: no HBV or HCV DNA detected.
Imaging: [**1-27**] RUQ Ultrasound: IMPRESSION:  No evidence of thrombus.
Diffuse heterogeneous echogenic liver consistent with fatty liver.
Heterogeneous liver parenchyma, which may be related to fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease, including hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis, cannot be excluded by ultrasound in the presence of fatty infiltration.
Small-vessel venoocclusive disease cannot be excluded by this study.
[**2-4**] RUE Ultrasound: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right upper extremity.
[**2-7**] CXR: No evidence of pneumonia.
[**2-13**] Portable abdomen: No evidence of obstruction.
[**2-26**] CXR: Mild right lower lobe atelectasis.
No evidence of pneumonia.
[**2-26**] CXR: Increased bilateral lower lung opacities could be consistent with developing infection or aspiration.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No evidence of DVT is seen.
No change in the bilateral lung opacifications.
[**2-27**] Bronchial Lavage: negative for malignant cells.

There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2194-2-26**], a pericardial effusion with evidence of cardiac tamponade are now present.
[**2-28**] CXR: Status post right-sided thoracentesis without evidence for pneumothorax.
Large bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
Multiple pulmonary nodules within the aerated portions of right upper and middle lobes.
Diffuse mesenteric stranding and small-to-moderate ascites.
Prominent stranding about the pancreatic head suggests pancreatitis.
[**2-28**] Pleural fluid cytology: negative for malignant cells.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
No right atrial diastolic collapse is seen.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
Pericardial constriction cannot be excluded (however, definitive signs of constrictive physiology were not evident on this study).
[**3-3**] Head CT: Multiple abnormal foci within both frontal lobes, of undetermined etiology.
The findings may represent small hemorrhages with surrounding edema, or foci of infection.
Diffusion-weighted imaging should also be performed.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2194-2-28**], the pericardial effusion appears smaller and the pleural effusion is not seen.
MR venography reveals normal flow in the major intracranial veins.
[**3-4**] EEG: The record displayed only low voltage slow and very slow activity and is consistent with a patient in a barbiturate coma.
No discharging features were seen.
[**3-5**] LENIs: No DVT involving either lower extremity, acute or chronic.
The right common femoral vein was not interrogated due to dialysis line.
There appeared to be very little cortical activity in the latter half of the tracing.
No epileptiform features or electrographic seizures were seen.
[**3-6**] EEG: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
The baseline recording showed an extremely low voltage slow background with no prominent focal features or any epileptiform activity.
The slow and low voltage background indicates a severe and widespread encephalopathy which may come from large amounts of medication, from ischemia, or from many other causes.
No evidence of seizures was present.
[**3-6**] TTE: No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
[**3-7**] EEG: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
The background throughout was a very low voltage that included some bursts of generalized slowing of apparently cortical origin.
There were no prominent focal features.
There were no epileptiform abnormalities.
[**3-8**] EEG: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
There were no epileptiform features or electrographic seizures.
The background showed a persistent low voltage somewhat regular background with some episodes of generalized slowing.
No changes in the background were seen at this time.
Otherwise, the EEG was fairly invariant throughout and showed a widespread encephalopathy, largely unchanged from the previous day's recording.
There were no epileptiform features or electrographic  seizures, including at the time of activations.
[**3-10**] EEG: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine sampling showed an encephalopathic slow low voltage background persisting through the first many hours of the recording but a much lower voltage background after that, including most of that from [**3-10**].
There were no prominent focal features.
There were no epileptiform abnormalities.
Equivocal mild enlargement of the liver.
Her cytoxan was held for one day due to elevated LFTs (ultrasound was normal with the exception of a fatty liver) but was then given after her LFTs trended down.
Initially this was thought to potentially be due to her recent c. difficile infection ([**2-1**]) although a repeat c. difficile test was negative and she had been treated with flagyl.
She was started on steroids (35 mg of solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]) and entocort and her diarrhea improved.
ID: She was started on levofloxacin, fluconazole (this was stopped after several days due to elevated LFTs), and acyclovir per the alloSCT protocol.
On [**2-1**] she developed diarrhea which was c.difficile positive and she was started on flagyl.
She then had expected febrile neutropenia and both vancomycin and caspofungin were added.
Elevated LFTs: She was noted to have elevated LFTs two times during her early hospital course.
The second elevation was thought to be due to fluconazole and also resolved following the cessation of these medications.
An ultrasound showed a heterogenous fatty liver but no signs of VOD.
By the time of planned discharge she was eating and drinking well without any nausea.
CXR revealed minimal opacities in the BL bases.
On exam the pt had diffuse rales.
Beside TTE revealed preserved systolic function.
THe pt was intubated for worsening resp distress and hypoxemia.
The pt remained anuric on HD2 in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Valganciclovir was added for empiric CMV coverage, IV Bactrim was started for empiric PCP coverage, and po Vanc was given for empiric C diff coverage.
MICU course: Her MICU course was quite complicated and included hypotension requiring up to three pressor agents at one point, renal failure that required one session of hemodialysis, elevated LFTS, question of TTP that required one session of plasmapheresis, multiple small cortical infarcts noted on her head CT/MRI, and questionable seizure activity that required both phenytoin and phenobarbital to control.
The etiology of her acute decompensation was not discovered but was thought to be an acute systemic inflammatory response that led to multi-organ failure.
With supportive care she eventually stabilized, including stabilization of her blood pressure, resolution of her renal and hepatic failure, and pancreatitis.
Neurology was consulted on the patient and the most likely explanation for CVA's was felt to be watershed infarctions from hypotension (unclear what ultimate cause of hypotension was).
She remained afebrile and her cultures remained negative, so she was kept only on prophylactic acyclovir, bactrim, and fluconazole.
The patient was noted to have hypertension, likely a side effect of cyclosporine, which was treated with nifedipine.
She was noted to have a new mild elevation in her LFTs.
There was no other evidence of GVH, so it was felt that this was due to medication effect, and the plan was to likely stop fluconazole as an outpt to see if LFT's improved.
She was also evaluated by psychiatry, but no antidepressants were started as the patient was not interested in starting such a medication.
