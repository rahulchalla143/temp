He reports a history of several weeks of diarrhea ([**4-25**] BM/day), nausea, and vomiting, with associated decreased food and fluid intake.
He denies fevers, chills, abdominal pain, hematemesis, hematochezia, melena, or BRBPR.
He denies any recent travel, sick contacts or antibiotic use.
He denies any fever, chills, chest pain or shortness of breath.
He received 4 Liters IV NS but had persistent hypotension as well as increased lactate to 3.6 and a Cr of 4.0, up from baseline of 1.7-1.9, and he was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

Sinus rhythm.
Right bundle-branch block.
Since the previous tracing of [**2153-10-13**] there may be no significant change, but baseline artifact makes comparison difficult  Radiology: [**10-22**] CXR: Lung volumes are reduced.
There is no free air under the diaphragm  [**10-22**] KUB: No gross evidence of toxic megacolon.
Difficult to exclude early or partial small bowel obstruction  [**10-24**] MRA Abdomen: Linear signal abnormality extending for 1.5 cm in the celiac artery likely representing a small, focal dissection of unknown acuity.
No MRI evidence of bowel ischemia.
Mild signal changes in the mesentery may represent mesenteric panniculitis as seen in the recent CT from [**2153-10-13**].
Non-distended terminal ileum without inflammation of the mesentery around it; thickening of the terminal ileum cannot be excluded on the basis of this study  [**10-26**] MR enterography: Normal-appearing terminal ileum.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 year old man with h/o HTN, CRI admitted with persistent nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and acute on chronic renal failure.
Initially in MICU given hypotension (resolved with hydration), transferred to general floor [**10-24**].
Further work-up included a 5HIAA, which was normal, and an EGD and colonoscopy which showed no clear source of diarrhea (proximal descending adenoma, see results section) with negative random duodenal/right colon biopsies (no evidence of microscopic colitis).
MRI enterogram was without evidence of inflammation of the ileum, and MRA of the abdomen showed only a small celiac dissection (see below).
Of note, MRI of his abdomen showed mild signal changes in the mesentery (see results section) which may represent mesenteric panniculitis as seen in the recent CT from [**2153-10-13**].
2) Anemia - iron deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency: The patient's hematocrit gradually trended down to a nadir 21.5 (26 at discharge).
As mentioned above, EGD and colonoscopy did not show source of bleeding, although iron studies were consistent with iron deficiency.
3) Acute on chronic renal failure: With hydration, the patient's creatinine gradually trended down from 4 on admission, indicating likely pre-renal etiology in the setting of diarrhea/poor PO intake.
5) Eosinophilia (new since [**9-24**]): Given diarrhea, there was concern for a parasitic infection, however multiple O&Ps were negative (see above).
The patient had a normal a.m. cortisol level, not consistent with adrenal insufficiency.
Further work-up should be pursued as an outpatient; if this persists, than bone marrow biopsy may be considered, particularly given the patient's history of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].
He was continued on a Humalog sliding scale  7) HTN: The patient's Lasix and Diovan were held throughout his hospital stay, given his acute renal failure.
The vascular surgery service was consulted, who felt it was likely chronic and recommended outpatient follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
You have been prescribed iron for your anemia.
Lasix and valsartan have been held given your renal failure.
You should not restart these until instructed to do so by your PCP 3) Please follow-up with your PCP or come to the emergency room if you develop rectal bleeding, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, lightheadedness, worsening diarrhea chest pain, or other symptoms that concern you.
