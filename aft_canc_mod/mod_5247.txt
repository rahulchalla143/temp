CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient status post craniotomy for tumor resection for postoperative evaluation.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were acquired before gadolinium.
T1 sagittal, axial and coronal images were obtained following gadolinium.
FINDINGS: Since the previous study, the patient has undergone resection of enhancing brain lesion in the left parietal convexity region.
Following gadolinium, enhancement is seen along the medial margin of the resection site as well as inferior margin of the resection site indicating some residual enhancement.
There is also evidence of small area of slow diffusion seen adjacent to the surgical site which could be related to surgery.
There is pneumocephalus identified.
There is no midline shift or hydrocephalus seen.
There is moderate brain atrophy.
Small amount of residual enhancement is seen immediately and inferior to the resection site.
No large hematoma seen, midline shift or hydrocephalus identified.
No change in the surrounding edema noted.
INDICATION: Brain tumor, preoperative for tumor resection.
MRI HEAD WITH CONTRAST: Enhancing peripheral mass in the left posterior parietal lobe is again demonstrated and unchanged compared to [**2198-12-7**].
Surrounding signal abnormality on T1-weighted images is also again demonstrated and not significantly changed.
No other enhancing lesions within the brain are seen.
IMPRESSION: Enhancing left parietal mass without significant change compared [**2198-12-7**].

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: rule out postop ICH.
HISTORY: Status post left parietal lobe tumor resection.
Evaluate for postoperative hemorrhage.
FINDINGS: There is expected air within the left parietal surgical bed and expected postoperative pneumocephalus and adjacent subcutaneous emphysema and swelling adjacent to the high right parietal craniotomy site.
No postoperative intraparenchymal or extra-axial hemorrhage is identified.
Stable-appearing vasogenic edema within the left parietal lobe.
The appearance of the head CT is otherwise unchanged with stable mild mucosal thickening within the right maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION:  Expected postoperative changes with no evidence of hemorrhage.
