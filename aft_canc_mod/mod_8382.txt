Admission Date:  [**2180-5-15**]       Discharge Date:  [**2180-6-8**]  Date of Birth:   [**2117-1-6**]       Sex:  M  Service:  BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT male with a history of acute myelogenous leukemia diagnosed in [**2180-1-8**] status post two cycles of Idarubicin and ARA-C on [**2-22**] and [**3-21**], with consolidation chemotherapy on [**2180-5-1**], who was admitted from the vomiting, and neutropenia.
The patient has complained of feeling "terrible" since the evening prior to admission.
His only specific complaint was low back pain radiating down both legs.
He denied any cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, headache, bright red blood per rectum, or melena.
The patient complained of pruritus and was given Benadryl IV.
He continued to complain of low back pain, but did not have any other complaints.
Given the patient's persistent hypotension despite intravenous fluid, the MICU Team was called to evaluate him.
Acute myelogenous leukemia diagnosed in [**2180-1-8**], status post Idarubicin, and ARA-C times two, with consolidation chemotherapy on [**2180-5-1**].
Acoustic neuroma.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
ALLERGIES:  The patient on admission had no known drug allergies but was found to be allergic to Ceftazidime.
No lymphadenopathy or jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular:  Sinus tachycardia with no murmurs.
Extremities:  Cool without cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.
He did not have any flank ecchymosis.
Ski:  The patient was noted to have a diffuse erythematous confluent papular rash over his extremities, trunk, groin, and proximal legs.
Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at 150 beats per minute.
He had a normal axis and intervals without any overt ischemic ST or T-wave changes.
On chest x-ray the patient was noted to have possible mild congestive heart failure with small pleural effusions and question of evolving pneumonia at the right lung base.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 63-year-old male with a history of acute myelogenous leukemia who is day 14 of consolidation chemotherapy who presented with fever and neutropenia.
The patient developed a rash, tachycardia, and hypotension after receiving one dose of Ceftazidime.
Our initial suspicion was that the hypotension was multifactorial, likely due secondary to sepsis, as well as anaphylaxis to the Ceftazidime.
An Allergy consult was obtained, and they concurred that the anaphylaxis was most likely secondary to the Ceftazidime.
Infectious disease:  On hospital day #3, the patient had 2 out of 2 blood cultures grow gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
His urine culture subsequently grew coag-negative staph as well.
The patient subsequently had a CT scan of his chest which revealed multiple inflammatory foci within his lungs, as well as bilateral small pleural effusions.
Their consensus was that these nodules most likely represented infected foci with MRSA.
The initial plan was to continue to treat the patient with Vancomycin and to subsequently reimage after a short duration of antibiotic therapy.
The patient was subsequently noted to have diffuse erythema and induration over his right deltoid.
The patient was seen by the Dermatology Service who obtained a biopsy of his right deltoid for pathologic analysis and culture.
The patient subsequently had a CT of his right shoulder which revealed .................. of his fat planes with nearby inflammation and edema.
The Dermatology Service felt that these findings were most consistent with a drug eruption, likely a residual response to the Ceftazidime.
Given his degree of MRSA bacteremia, the patient had a TTE to rule out endocarditis.
The patient subsequently had an MRI of his abdomen to rule out hepatosplenic candidiasis after his liver function tests were noted to be mildly elevated.
This revealed a 5.2 x 4.5 cm cystic lesion with rim enhancement over the right psoas.
This was felt to be consistent with abscess.
The patient was subsequently noted to have a tender, inflamed right calf.
The right deltoid edema and erythema that he had were noted to be worse.
His right deltoid and left calf continued to be tender, indurated, and erythematous.
The patient underwent incision and drainage of the right deltoid and left calf fluid collections.
He did not have any reaccummulation in either the deltoid or the calf.
He subsequently had a repeat CAT scan to evaluate for interval change in the pulmonary nodules and psoas collection.
The pulmonary nodules were noted to be decreased in size but not number.
This was still felt to be consistent with a therapeutic response.
Of note, the psoas collection was noted to have resolved, and the pigtail catheter was removed.
We will dose the Vancomycin only for trough levels of under 20 given his acute on chronic renal insufficiency.
The bone marrow aspirate was consistent with remission.
The patient had a FENa of approximately 4% which was more consistent with an intrinsic renal etiology.
Anaphylactic reaction to Ceftazidime.
Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus sepsis with multiple abscess foci status post drainage.
Acute myelogenous leukemia in remission.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
History of carotid insufficiency.
