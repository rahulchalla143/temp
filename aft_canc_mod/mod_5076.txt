He was restaged which showed invasion to the lamina propria but also extensive glandular involvement of the prostate with no stromal invasion.
He has been followed by pulmonary for pulmonary fibrosis which previously had shown BOOP in the past on biopsy.
Past Medical History: HTN BPH DM  Social History: Has a 40 pack year h/o tobacco and quit at the age of 37.
Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: NAD EOM full, PERRLA Chest coarse throughout with bibasilar crackles RRR, no MRG Abdomen soft, appropriately tender, incision clean and dry LE warm, well-perfused  Pertinent Results: CHEST PORT.
LINE PLACEMENT  Reason: r/o pulmonary edema  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 75 year old man with h/o BOOP, s/p radical cystoprostatectomy REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o pulmonary edema AP CHEST  HISTORY: BOOP.
Rule out pulmonary edema.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2158-11-25**] and [**2159-10-17**]:  Chronic interstitial pulmonary disease accounts for the bulk of pulmonary abnormalities, but there is slight increase in opacification in the left lower lobe, which could represent pneumonia or aspiration and an increase in the background density of the lungs, which may be a function of differing radiologic technique or mild pulmonary edema.
Nevertheless, there is no mediastinal vascular engorgement, appreciable increase in heart size or indication of substantial pleural effusion to suggest congestive heart failure.
***pt will be on [**Hospital Ward Name **] in the afternoon*** HISTORY: Postoperative with shortness of breath suggesting pulmonary edema.
There is again diffuse prominence of interstitial markings consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.
Some increasing opacification at the left base may reflect some atelectasis or pneumonia or be a manifestation of bronchiectatic changes from previous inflammatory disease.
The night of admission, the pt's pain was well controlled with an epidural, and he was monitored in the PACU without any complications.
POD1, the pt was bolused on a few occasions for marginal urine output, but by POD2, the pt was making adequate urine without any additional fluids.
Pulm: Preop diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis, so pulmonology was intimately involved in the pt's postoperative plan.
CXRs demonstrated no evidence of CHF or worsening pulmonary processes.
No episodes of chest pain, palpitations or other cardiac events.
H: Postoperatively the pt received a dose of coumadin for PE prophylaxis.
After the INR dropped sufficiently, the epidural was pulled without complication, and the pt was discharged home on POD5.
