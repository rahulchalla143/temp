Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis with temporary drain  History of Present Illness: HPI: 67-year-old w/ newly diagnosed metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, originally called in to ED after finding of pericardial effusion on ECHO.
SHe was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name **] service on [**2119-9-25**] for pericardial effusion and went to cath for drainage of 240 cc of serous fluid with relief of tamponade.
F/u echocardiograms showed no pericardial effusion.
The pt was in her usual good state of health until mid-[**Month (only) 205**] when she noted a dry [**Month (only) **], increased fatigue, and decreased appetite.
In early [**Month (only) 216**], she had a chest x-ray, which showed multiple pulmonary nodules, followed by CT scan of her chest at [**Location (un) 620**], which confirmed multiple pulmonary nodules, bilateral pleural effusions, and a possible pericardial effusion.
A subsequent lymph node biopsy from the right lateral neck on [**2119-9-14**] and showed poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma consistent with lung primary.
She may have tried Tessalon but not clear on the dose.
She notes no breast problems or past history of breast issues.
No pleuritic CP.
Mild inc in SOB w/ exertion on one flight of stairs.
Current ROS on transfer to OMED:   Past Medical History: BSO-TAH for carcinoma in situ of the cervix in [**2109**] osteoporosis anxiety +/- depression   Social History: She has been a long-term smoker at least 45 years of often over a pack a day.

The right ventricle appears compressed, but no clear diastolic collapse is seen.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No  mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
There  is echo dense material within the pericardial space consistent with blood,  inflammation or other cellular elements.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2119-9-26**],  there has been no significant change.
Brief Hospital Course: 67F newly-diagnosed NSCLCa presented originally for echocardiogram to evaluate shortness of breath, found to have significant tamponade.
1) Pericardial effusion:  Catheterization revealed a significant pericardial effusion with tamponade.
Patient continued to do well following removal of the drain with pulsus paradoxicus ranging between 5-7mmHg.
On therapeutic cath, found to have sig tamponade -> s/p pericardiocentesis with post-procedure drain.
2) Shortness of breath: Despite successful pericardiocentesis, patient continued to have shortness of breath and supplement oxygen requirement.
On CXR she was noted to have an enlarging left sided pleural effusion.
A repeat CXR on [**2119-10-9**] showed re-accumulation of her left sided pleural effusion and worsening of her right sided pleural effusion.
She had neutropenia requiring her to be placed on precautions and treated with GCSF.
Social work has been envolved with her discussing coping and her diagnosis.
4) [**Date Range **]: While in the hospital she had lots of problems with [**Name2 (NI) **] productive of white sputum.

Morphine Sulfate 10 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: One (1)  PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for dyspnea.
Non-small cell lung cancer 2.
Depression 3.
Pleural effusion   Discharge Condition: Stable, needs some help with ADLs secondary to shortness of breath.
