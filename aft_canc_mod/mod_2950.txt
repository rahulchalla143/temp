Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia to 115 beats per minute with diffuse ST depressions that improved with rate control and nitrates.
He ruled in for an myocardial infarction at [**Hospital3 **] with a peak CK of 609 and a troponin greater then 50.
Heparin was not given, because he has had chronic bloody secretions and a hematoma at a recent Port-A-Cath site.
The patient was transferred to the floor and was observed to be tachypneic and dyspneic.
The patient was given Lasix with 2.5 liters of diuresis, but there was no change in his respiratory status.
The patient did complain of dyspnea, but did not complain of chest pain upon transfer to the MICU.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, head and neck cancer diagnosed with cervical lymphadenopathy, status post chemotherapy, 5FU and radiation therapy.
The patient has chronic severe oral dryness.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
No palpable lymphadenopathy.
Chest light crackles one fourth up bilaterally, otherwise clear to auscultation.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen obese, soft, nontender, nondistended positive bowel sounds.
Chronic venous stasis changes noted on right ankle.
INITIAL IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 68 year-old male with head and neck cancer with coronary artery disease recent myocardial infarction transferred to Medical Intensive Care Unit for management and close observation of tachypnea and hypoxia.
Sputum was sent for culture.
It did not reveal any organisms besides the oropharyngeal flora.
Chest x-ray suggested a possible interstitial process.
The patient had a CT scan, which revealed no pulmonary embolus, chronic interstitial process at the extreme bases with diffuse ground glass opacities worrisome for an underlying infectious or inflammatory process and multiple pulmonary nodules consistent with the patient's metastasis or perhaps primary lung tumor.
The patient subsequently became more hypoxemic and acidotic and became more and more difficult to ventilate and oxygen properly.
The patient became hypertensive and pressors were started neo-synephrine in particular.
The patient proceeded to rule in for another myocardial infarction after the pressor initiation.
The patient received an echocardiogram, which revealed a global hypokinesis and a depressed ejection fraction about 40%.
He was started on heparin for myocardial infarction.
The patient on the morning of [**2169-5-30**] was noted to have fixed dilated pupils and lack of oculocephalic reflex on physical examination.
Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction.
