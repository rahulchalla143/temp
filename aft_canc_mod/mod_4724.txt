Admission Date:  [**2162-4-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2162-4-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2121-12-30**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: [**9-27**] headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2162-4-8**]: Left [**Month/Day/Year 5041**] placement [**2162-4-8**]: Diagnostic Cerebral Angiogram [**2162-4-9**]: Craniotomy & Mass Resection.
She currently complains of headache, although confused and unable to obtain other history.
Speech slurred with slowed response.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Not cooperating with formal motor exam, but moves all extremities symmetrically.
Toes downgoing bilaterally   Pertinent Results: Cerebral Angiogram: [**2162-4-8**] Extensive subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage.
Given the predominant location of intracranial hemorrhage in the cistern of lamina terminalis, the likely potential source of bleeding is considered anterior communicating artery.
However, no discrete aneurysm formation  [**2162-4-8**] CT Brain - Interval placement of ventricular drain with slight decrease in ventricular size.
[**2162-4-8**] MRI Brain w/w/o contrast - Abnormal enhancement is seen in the suprasellar region  surrounding the hemorrhage extending to the sellar region suspicious for a suprasellar mass.
However, the tumor characteristics are somewhat altered secondary to hemorrhage and compression.
[**2162-4-9**] - No change in the ventricular or suprasellar hemorrhage.
[**2162-4-9**] CT brain - Postoperative changes related to right ventriculostomy catheter placement with fluid and air along its course.
Heterogeneous suprasellar hemorrhagic mass is stable in appearance.
No acute infarcts are seen.
No evidence of hydrocephalus.
No evidence fo acute hemorrhage or hydrocephalus   [**4-18**] CTA Chest- Thrombus is present in the left lower lobe segmental pulmonary arteries.
There is no significant evidence of right heart strain, however, the RV/LV ratio is difficult to assess as the left ventricle is predominantly in systole during the examination.
Hematoma within the suprasellar cistern decreased in size and conspicuity, compatible with expected evolution of blood products.
No new hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect.
No hydrocephalus.
[**4-19**] LENI's- No evidence of residual DVT in either lower extremity.
Interval enlargement of the subgaleal fluid collection overlying the right frontal craniotomy.
No evidence of interval change in the intracranial compartment.
No hydrocephalus.
Decrease in subgaleal collection as 60cc was reportedly aspirated.
She was taken to angiogram the following day to evaluate for an underlying vascular lesion.
She was started on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
An MRI of the brain with contrast revealed a small enhancing lesion above the pituitary gland.
During her post angio course patient had diabetes insipidus on [**2162-4-8**].
She continued to have increase urine output, but improved with DDAVP.
Patient remained intubated and was taken to the operating room on [**4-9**] for Right frontal craniotomy resection of sella/supra sellar mass and right [**Month/Year (2) 5041**] placement.
She had a post operative head CT and MRI which showed partial resection of sellar mass and post operative changes.
There was no evidence infarct or acute hemorrhages.
She was extubated without incident and continued to be monitored with prn DDAVP for high urine output and elevated Serum Na.
Pt tolerated it without elevation of ICPs or increased headache.
A NCHCT was obtained to assess for hydrocephalus which showed stable ventricular size.
On [**4-15**] a repeat Head CT showed stable size of lateral ventricles without evidence of HCP.
Thus [**Name2 (NI) 5041**]'s were removed in routine fashion without incident.
Another repeat head CT deomonstrated no acute hemorrhage or hydrocephalus.
Her u/a was significant for infection so she was started on a course of cipro and her foley was changed.
She then began putting out excessive amounts of urine and continued to be tachycardic so a CTA chest was performed which was positive for PE.
She also underwent placement of an IVC filter with General Surgery.
On the evening of [**4-19**] it was noted that she had an enlarging subgaleal collection under the right craniotomy site and so a head CT was performed that demonstrated communication with the ventricular system.
A followup head CT was obtained on the morning of [**4-21**] that showed enlargement of the subgaleal collection.
On the evening of [**4-21**] an Left Frontal [**Date Range 5041**] was attempted but was not successful, likely due to small ventricular size.
Repeat head CT on [**4-22**] demonstrated no increase in ventricular size but did show residual fluid collection.
HEr subgaleal collection had slightly reaccumulated and her neuro status was stable so the collection was not drained.
Her subgaleal collection remained stable if not slightly decreased without headwrap.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
