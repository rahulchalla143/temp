The patient reports that the mass on her left neck started to appear six months ago and orginated like a swollen lymph node.
The mass itself has not been painful or tender to the touch.
She has been losing weight recently because of the difficulty eating.
The patient denies any difficulty in breathing.
She denies any symptoms aside from the pain with mouth movement and weight loss.
The patient has not had any sick contacts and has never traveled overseas.
The mass is not resectable due to encasement of vessels, but they will follow and recommend an FNA.
ENT also recommends patient be NPO and have a Speech and Swallow consult.
The patient received blood cultures and a swab of the left neck mass.
Family History: The patient denies that any cancers, heart disease, or diabetes, runs in her family.

Left neck mass Fluid SWAB: [**2105-9-12**] 11:11 pm       SWAB     GRAM STAIN (Final [**2105-9-13**]):       2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2105-9-15**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is       performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.
Susceptibility will be performed on P.aeruginosa and       S.aureus if sparse growth or greater..     FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):       NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
A swab is not the optimal specimen for recovery of mycobacteria or       filamentous fungi.
Whenever possible tissue biopsy or aspirated fluid should       be submitted.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):       A swab is not the optimal specimen for recovery of mycobacteria or       filamentous fungi.
Whenever possible tissue biopsy or aspirated fluid should       be submitted.
NO MYCOBACTERIA ISOLATED.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2105-9-14**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR.
Blood cultures: NO GROWTH .
IMAGING: CXR PA & LAT [**2105-9-12**] IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Heterogeneous ill-defined large left neck mass with internal necrosis compatible with a neoplasm.
This mass encases and markedly attenuates the left internal carotid artery as well as occludes the distal branches of the left external carotid artery as well as the left internal jugular vein.
Please note that superimposed infection of this necrotic mass cannot be excluded on this imaging study.
Multiple enhancing left submental and submandibular lymph nodes suspicious for malignancy.
Right thyroid nodule.
Biapical lung scarring.
US guided FNA of left neck mass [**2105-9-15**] POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Consistent with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.
Thyroid US [**2105-9-21**] IMPRESSION: Solitary 1.2 x 1.8 cm posterior mass in lower pole of right lobe of thyroid gland as was shown on recent CT scan.
Brief Hospital Course: 79-year-old woman without significant past medical history who presented with a left neck mass and weight loss, found to have poorly differentiated sqaumous cell carcinoma.
# Left neck mass: Per aspiration Biopsy and PET-CT scan, poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with multiple adjacent lymph nodes, involved hilar LN and pulmonary nodule.
G tube is placed prior to initiation of chemotherapy and radiation therapy in anticipation of significant mucositis which would aggrevate even more her poor oral intake.
The following day, she had biopsy of her left hilar lymph node through bronchoscopy.
# Anemia: Baseline unknown.
Her anemia is normocytic.
No signs of active bleeding, vital signs were stable throughout her stay.
# Fall - on [**9-26**] she fell out of her hospital bed, she did not loose consiousness or have any evidence of trauma on clinical exam.
# Urinary retention: on [**9-28**] patient found to have urinary retention which resolved with foley with 400cc residual.
# elevated blood pressures: this was noted on [**9-27**] with SBP to max of 190.
Patient does not have HTN at baseline and this was thought to be secondary to urinary retention.
BP's trended down after resolution of urinary retention.
# Right forarm swelling.
# mental and cognitive status: patient very soft spoken at baseline with impression of mild cognitive decline.
- Pull foley on [**9-29**] for voiding trial - follow-up pathology results from biopsy on neck mass and pulmonary lesion - follow-up as below with oncology and radiation oncology - patient does not have a listed PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 5001**] discharge home from rehab may call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1300**] to establish care at [**Hospital **] if interested.
Medications on Admission: None  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Poorly differentiated Squamous Cell Carcinoma (left neck) with possible metastasis .
Secondary Diagnosis: Anemia - borderline microcytic   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: mostly Clear and coherent, confused sometimes.
