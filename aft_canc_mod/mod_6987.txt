Admission Date:  [**2133-5-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-5-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-9-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: CPAP  History of Present Illness: 62 yo M with metastatic renal cell carcinoma to lung and spine with recent XRT to thoracid spine, hemochromatosis, HTN, admitted for respiratory distress.
Limited history is available from the patient given his respiratory distress.
Patient reported acute onsert SOB that woke him up at 4am.
He was stridorous and received racemic epi without significant effect.
He was noted to have chronic venous stasis changes and his BNP was ~1200, so he was given lasix 20mg as thought was pulmonary edema.
On arrival to the floor, he is acute distress and only able to answer yes/no questions.
He denies chest pain but endorses chest tightness and significant difficulty breathing.
Past Medical History: Metatstatic RCC to lung and thoracic spine HTN EtOH abuse Hemochromatosis Pseudogout  Social History: Not working, no tobacco or drugs.
Family History: Father with history of CVA in his 60s.
No history of sudden death or death in unusual circumstances.
Physical Exam: Physical Exam on admission: GEN: pleasant, comfortable, NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, MMM, op without lesions, no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, no jvd, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules CV: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g RESP: CTA b/l with good air movement throughout ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly EXT: no c/c/e SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice/no splinters NEURO: AAOx3.
Bibasilar opacities and blunting of the right costophrenic angle correspond to pleural effusions, overlying atelectasis, and possible pulmonary edema and metastatic disease on subsequent chest CT. 2.
Nodular opacity in the left mid lung corresponds to pulmonary nodule on subsequent CT consistent with metastasis.
CT Head ([**5-24**]):  No evidence of metastatic disease in this non-contrast CT head.
An MRI is more sensitive for more sensitive for metastatic disease .
Extensive bilateral pulmonary metastatic disease.
Bibasilar consolidations, may represent a combination of metastatic disease or atelectasis.
Superimposed infection is not excluded.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Extensive osseous metastatic disease of the thoracic spine and bilateral ribs.
CT Neck ([**5-24**]): Extensive osseous metastatic lesions in the lower cervical spine  and upper thoracic spine as described in detail above, also involving the ribs, correlation with MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine is recommended for characterization of the thecal sac and rule out spinal cord involvement.
Mild multilevel degenerative changes at C5/C6.
Atherosclerotic calcifications are visualized at the cervical carotid bifurcations.
Multiple pulmonary nodules in both lungs with bibasilar consolidations and interstitial thickening also suggesting metastatic disease, please refer to the report of the dedicated CT of the chest performed concurrently.
TTE ([**5-25**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Technically suboptimal to exclude focal wall motion abnormality .
CXR ([**5-25**]): In comparison with the study of [**5-24**], there is increase in the bilateral pulmonary opacifications, most likely consistent with pulmonary edema and underlying metastatic disease (seen on prior CT scan).
In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to also be considered.
Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications again are most likely reflective of pulmonary edema and underlying metastatic disease that was seen on the previous CT scan.
In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
Brief Hospital Course: 62 year diagnosed with RCC 1 year ago with mets to lungs and spine s/p XRT and dexamethasone taper who was admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress resolving well with diuresis.
Hypoxic Respiratory distress: Patient with hypoxia in the setting of flash pulmonary edema, chest xray at admission showed right sided opacity and bilateral infiltrates consistent with edema and pneumonia.
The patient was diuresed with Lasix IV and had a net loss of near 9 liters in the medical ICU with very good improvement of respiratory status.
He also had purulent sputum concerning for pneumonia.
Sputum cultures were sent and showed only commensal respiratory flora.
Echocardiogram showed normal global biventricular systolic function and there was no significant pathology seen at the valves.
# Elevated Troponin: At presentation, the patient did not have chest pain, but did show non-specific EKG changes with ST changes in leads V4-6.
He had mildly elevated troponin which downtrended, and CK-MB and MBI which downtrended on 2nd set of cardiac enzymes.
As above, TTE was with normal systolic function without wall motion abnormalities, and this was felt to not be consistent with ACS.
Patient was tachycardic to 130's so most likely demand ischemia rather than acute coronary syndrome from coronary disease.
Repeat EKG did not show acute ischemic changes, and the patient was started on ASA 325mg daily and high dose statin after LFTs returned normal.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: The patient's oncologist was called and per discussion, his lung metastases were considered unlikely to be cause of his acute respiratory distress.
Chronic kidney disease: The patients chronic kidney disease was believed to be secondary to being status post nephrectomy.
His lisinopril and indomethacin were held while in the hospital with plan to resume on outpatient basis after follow of his kidney status by his primary care physician.
He had no signs of withdrawal during the first 72 hours of his hospital stay and so the protocol was taken off.
# Wound care: Patient was seen by our wound care team with the following plan: WOUND CARE FOR ULCER ABOVE RIGHT ANKLE Commercial wound cleanser to irrigate/cleanse all open wounds.
Apply moisture barrier ointment to the peri wound tissue with each DRG change.
Please check Mr. [**Known lastname **] electrolytes and kidney status, and resume lisinopril and indomethacin per PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 8469**].
It is also recommended that Mr. [**Known lastname **] have follow up with a cardiologist given his mildly elevated cardiac enzymes at admission.
Disp:*1 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: 1. pulmonary edema 2. metastatic renal cell carcinoma .
Hypertension 2.
Chronic kidney disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath, which was likely from excess fluid in your lungs (pulmonary edema), COPD, and possibly pneumonia.
You were also seen by wound care for your ulcer at your lower right leg.
Please continue to take care of this ulcer as you were before with help at the VA. You also had an echocardiogram of your heart which was showed normal function and valves.
Please seek medical attention for any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, or any other concerning symptoms.
