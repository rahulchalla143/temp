At that time, she was afebrile with a normal white blood cell count and a pelvic US showed: an enlarged uterus with multiple uterine fibroids.
The dominant fibroid seen in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen with carneous degeneration seen on the prior MRI of [**2169-3-31**], has minimally increased in size.
No significant change in the overall fibroid size.
Trace free fluid in the left lower quadrant.
Degenerating and possibly torsion of these known fibroids and/or left ovarian cyst was thought to be the cause of her acute pain.
She had a UAE then proceeded to the OR for laparoscopy converted to supracervical hysterectomy and LSO for fibroid uterus and endometrioma.
Intra-operative findings revealed a markedly enlarged fibroid uterus (weighing ~2129g), stage 4 endometriosis with extensive adhesions, a large left ovarian endometrioma, and copious amount of brown tinged ascites-- the cause of the patient's acute pain was unclear.
Post-op, she was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring given her long operation and large amount of intraoperative fluids.
Her pain was managed with a Dilaudid PCA with good effect.
A plan was made to keep the foley in place for 10-14 days post-operatively to allow for bladder healing given the extent of lysis of adhesions involving the bladder.
