Admission Date:  [**2118-1-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-1-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-10-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**] Chief Complaint: Hypercarbic respiratory failure and altered mental status.
History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname 174**] is a 61 year-old man with history of OSA, HTN, presenting with altered mental status, found to have hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Marked hypersomnolence with an episode of falling asleep mid-sentence on the phone.
Family noted weight gain as well.
Two days prior to presentation he complained of back, leg, and neck pain.
No fevers/chills no recent respiratory tract infections.
Brought to [**Location (un) 620**], noted to be altered and with respiratory distress.
CT head with findings somewhat concerning for SAH (later found to be misread).
Did have an episode of SBP 80, responding to fluids.
CTA performed with no evidence of aneurysm.
Also noted to have ECG changes - <1 mm STE inferiorly.
Admitted to MICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Past Medical History: - OSA - does not wear mask he was prescribed - HTN - hypercholesterolemia - osteoporosis - s/p hernia repair (approx 10 years ago) - dental infections (approx [**2117-7-7**]), including mandibular infection - had colonoscopy at least 2-3 years ago  Social History: - Tobacco: smoked since being a teen, up to three packs per day, ~ 100 pack year history - Alcohol: rare - Illicits: none (per cousin) - Retired one year ago  Family History: Unknown.
Lungs: Mild bilateral rhonchi, no wheezes or crackles.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, 1+ LE edema, equal bilaterally.
Bilateral LE rash - erythematous macules with small papules, mostly blanching - over medial legs/ankles.
No other adenopathy.
Pertinent Results: Labs: [**Location (un) 620**] labs: WBC: 7.1 HCT: 59.5 Plts: 150 Serum/urine Tox Screen neg 7.19/119/47  140/ 98/ 20 --------------- 109 4.7/ 38.5/ 1.0  ALT 50 AST 35 AP 70 T.Bili 0.4 Ca 8.7 Alb 3.4  Micro: Blood cultures x 3 - no growth.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Final [**2118-1-11**]):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
Images:  CT Head at [**Location (un) 620**]: INCREASED ATTENUATION OF THE INTRACRANIAL ARTERIES AND VENOUS SINUSES QUESTION PRIOR CONTRAST ADMINISTERED.
CONSIDER MRI OF THE HEAD AND MR ANGIOGRAM OF THE HEAD IF THERE IS NO CONTRAST INDICATION FOR BETTER ASSESSMENT OF THE BRAIN PARENCHYMA FOR FOCAL LESIONS.
Newly occurred is a severe parenchymal opacity that occupies almost the entire left hemithorax.
The opacity is associated with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and leftward shift of the mediastinum.
Both signs suggest atelectatic volume loss of the left lung.
The predescribed right lower lobe opacities are better seen than on the previous examination and still suggest either early pneumonia or status post aspiration.
No pulmonary edema.
CTA head: No change from recent [**Location (un) **] CT with persistant high attenuation along vessels, suggesting retained contrast.
CTA: No aneurysms or thrombosis.
Persistent small left effusion, retrocardiac opacity, and left perihilar opacity.
Persistent right basilar ill-defined opacity, concerning for infection or aspiration.
MRI head: Findings most consistent with chronic small vessel infarction, without characteristic signal pattern suggestive of herpes encephalitis.
ADDENDUM AND COMMENT: There is mild high T2 signal within the mastoid sinus complexes as well, likely indicating an ongoing inflammatory process as well.
Finally, regarding the exclusion of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage, a CT scan is far more effective than an MRI in addressing this issue.
In that regard, a CT scan was performed yesterday and did not appear to disclose subarachnoid blood at that time.
Also, a CT angiogram, obtained yesterday as well, is quite useful in the exclusion of an aneurysm involving the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] and major vascular tributaries.
Labs on Discharge:   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 174**] is a 61 year-old man with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, untreated OSA, one month of increased tiredness, reduced activity tolerance and shortness of breath, eventually presenting, at the urging of family, with hypercarbic respiratory failure and stupor.
For question of subarachnoid hemorrhage was transferred for Neurosurgical evaluation at [**Hospital1 18**].
A combination of pumonary parenchymal processes were clear with less clear contribution of neurologic causes.
Treated for PNA and COPD he improved and despite low NIFs, respiratory status improved with treatment and the weaning of sedation.
Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia The etiology of his respiratory failure is unclear, but it is important to note that he suffers from untreated OSA (without marked pulmonary hypertension), about 120 pack-year history of smoking, HTN, polycythemia (perhaps due to chronic hypoxia or maybe primary), PNA and apparently abnormal respiratory drive ??????
in response to hypoxia or reduced pressure support he becomes tachypneic with low tidal volumes.
due to desynchrony with ventilator and tachypneic episodes.
The etiology of low NIFs (-12 to -26 cmH2O) is still unclear, but Neurology have suggested Parsonage-[**Doctor Last Name **] brachial plexopathy with diaphragmatic involvement,  but effectively ruled-out neuromuscular causes including myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], ALS, Guillian-[**Location (un) **] and thinking other causes unlikely.
COPD Likely based on hypercarbia, but emphysema not impressive on CT.
Fever No fever now; No positive cultures nor other obvious site of infection.
Unlikely VAP but possibly due to earlier PNA at admission.
Suggest PFTs and DLCO as outpatient after recovery from acute event.
CAD NSTEMI on arrival ??????
Low dose statin restarted.
Not a complete contraindication, therefore on lower dose (which can still be of benefit)  Lethargy/altered mental status Has resolved with weaning of sedation.
[**Month (only) 116**] have been purely secondary to respiratory failure.
Good to keep in mind unlikely contribution of brainstem Binswanger disease but presentation somewhat indolent.
White Matter Disease MRI brain shows Binwanger changes with increased signal in subcortical white matter and pons that was not acute.
No focality on neurologic exam.
Possible contributor to respiratory failure, although white matter changes must be more than one week earlier than diffuse sequence MRI on admission and no acute onset changes in history.
Nonetheless, important to keep in mind that pontine changes may possibly contributor to reduced respiratory drive.
Unclear if drug reaction (is similar to drug rash) or, perhaps less likely, viral exanthem.
Occasional aleve for headaches (~ 3x/month) but no other OTC's.

You were also noted to have a small heart attack.
There was concern that you had bleeding in your brain, but that did not turn out to be the case.
You must use the CPAP machine at night due to your Obstrcutive Sleep Apnea.
