During [**Date Range **], he received sphincterotomy and biliary stent due to high grade stricture.
He did not tolerate the procedure well, was intubated, sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], & required Neosynephine for shock and completed a course of Levo/Flagy for biliary organisms.
Patient sent to rehab on [**2155-4-25**] and was sent to [**Hospital3 **], [**Location (un) **], MA ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 93909**]) after having respiratory distress.
imaging notable for large pleural effusions.
patient reports that he's had a nonproductive cough for 3 weeks with an acute onset of SOB within the past 24 hours.
he denies chest pain ,lightheadedness, palpitations, abdominal pain.
HTN Obesity Gout Hypothyroidism Shrapnel in his face during WWII s/p removal  Social History: He is a widow with two daughters.
Family History: no h/o Ca, CAD, DM  Physical Exam: as of [**2155-5-9**] 08:01 PM Tcurrent: 36.2 ?????
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
Assess volume status.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-19**] through [**4-21**]: Right lung base is elevated yet heart, mediastinum is shifted to the right indicating that whatever pleural effusion is present is offset by a greater volume of right middle and lower lobe collapse.
There is mild congestion in the right upper lobe, but not in the left.
The heart is mildly to moderately enlarged but unchanged and mediastinal vascular engorgement is present indicating the heart failure if any is probably limited to the right side.
Gaseous distention of the stomach is moderately severe.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 M w/ recent admission for painless jaundice s/p [**Month (only) **] with sphincterotomy and biliary stent c/b hypoxia requiring intubation, admitted with septic shock; source unclear, but differential diagnostic considerations included pneumonia, infectious diarrhea, or less likely cholangitis.
Blood cultures grew out methicillin-resistant staph aureus on hospital day two, and pt continued on vancomycin.
With his compromised respiratory status, intubation was discussed with the family, but since he had an underlying malignancy of the biliary tree and numerous co-morbid conditions, his family decided that it was in his best interest to to avoid intubation.
He was therefore treated with antibiotics, supportive care for septic shock including volume resuscitation directed by CVP monitoring, vasopressors, and euglycemic control.
Thoracentesis was considered for large pleural effusions, but given his family's stated goals of care, invasive procedures were declined, especially with the increased risk of hemothorax as he was anticoagulated with coumadin on admission.
After 72 hours of ICU-level management of septic shock, hemodynamics stabilized but oxygenation did not improve, and his mental status declined.
He developed acute renal failure despite supportive care for septic shock.
His daughters decided to withdraw supportive measures that were likely only prolonging his life without meaningful benefit, given that he was unlikely to recover to his pre-hospital functional status and also had a likely malignant lesion of the biliary tract.
Narcotics and benzodiazepines were used to control pain and agitation.
