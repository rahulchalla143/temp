Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF MICU COURSE: The patient was admitted to the ICU and underwent EGD by GI, which revealed multiple ulcerated masses in the duodenum.
She did not have any further episodes of hematemesis.
She also had some new TWI, which were felt to be demand in the setting of GI bleed.
She was ruled out for MI with serial CE's.
Given her EGD findings, she underwent a CT scan, which showed some progression of her tumor, particularly with peritoneal implant and mucosal implant within third portion of duodenum.
However, it was felt that XRT was not an option because the patient had already had significant radiation to that area and would be at risk for perforation.
Several biopsies were taken from the duodenal masses found previously.
