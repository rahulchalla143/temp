LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of [**2144-6-10**] 12:15 PM FINDINGS: A pacemaker/AICD overlies the left lateral thoracic chest wall with leads in unchanged position.
There is no pneumothorax.
Borderline cardiomegaly persists.
Lateralization of the apex of the right hemidiaphragm which may suggest a small underlying subpulmonic effusion.
There is no focal consolidation.
Radiology Report PORTABLE ABDOMEN Study Date of [**2144-6-10**] 12:16 PM IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for early or partial small bowel obstruction.
Persistent dilatation of the small bowel, without a discrete transition point.
Although early or partial obstruction is difficult to exclude, the appearance is more consistent with an ileus.
Suspected peritoneal drop metastasis in the lower pelvis, with overall evaluation for metastatic disease highly limited by technique.
Asymmetric thickening along the pylorus, in the setting of more diffuse gastric wall thickening, which may be inflammatory in etiology.
A moderate amount of subcutaneous edema is seen within bilateral lower extremities.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT of bilateral lower extremities.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**6-12**]:  INDICATION: 82-year-old man with end-colostomy for bladder tumor, now with nausea, vomiting and higher nasogastric tube output.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right than left, of low density with associated parenchymal opacities, most likely represent atelectasis.
A nasogastric tube terminates immediately beyond the pylorus, which shows asymmetric thickening up to 12 mm.
There is a persistent moderate hydronephrosis of the left kidney, slightly increased, with mural thickening of the left ureter and again a suspected filling defect, as noted before.
A similar 3- cm focal fusiform aneurysm of the mid infrarenal aorta is also present.
The stomach and entire bowel show mild-to-moderate wall thickening, and there is diffuse stranding in the mesentery and along the subcutaneous tissues of the flanks.
There is also moderate ascites of low density, particularly adjacent to the lateral aspect of the spleen.
There is no free air.
However, the distal small bowel is again moderately dilated to a similar extent as on a plain film from two days ago.
The lack of intravenous contrast makes it difficult to evaluate for metastatic disease, but limiting evaluation, particularly in the setting of diffuse edema.
Along the anterior and right side of the bladder, there is marked thickening as noted previously.
In the lower pelvis, there is a dense area along the dependent portion of the ascites, most likely representing a metastatic nodule of 13 mm in diameter.
A small some amount of ascites layers in the pelvis.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
Persistent dilatation of the small bowel, without a discrete transition point.
Although early or partial obstruction is difficult to exclude, the appearance is more consistent with an ileus.
Suspected peritoneal drop metastasis in the lower pelvis, with overall evaluation for metastatic disease highly limited by technique.
Asymmetric thickening along the pylorus, in the setting of more diffuse gastric wall thickening, which may be inflammatory in etiology.
Nausea, vomiting, and poor ostomy output.
There has been interval increase in dilation of a loop of small bowel in the left abdomen measuring 5.1 cm.
No mucosal or submucosal abnormality is suggested to this loop within the limitations of this radiograph.
Dual-lead pacemaker leads are noted in the periphery of the film in gross standard position.
Degenerative changes within the spine, not well evaluated on this radiograph.
Findings suggestive of high-grade small-bowel obstruction  CT w/o contrast [**2144-6-19**]:  HISTORY: 82-year-old male with bladder cancer status post partial colectomy and colostomy, suspected ileus/obstruction.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Visualized heart and pericardium reveal no evidence of pericardial effusion.
Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions are present, with associated atelectasis of the lung.
Both kidneys are atrophic, with persistent moderate hydronephrosis of the left kidney similar to prior study.
There is persistent distention of the small bowel to the level of the ileocecal valve, with decompression of the colon to the colostomy in the left lower abdominal wall.
There are no findings to suggest associated ischemia of the small bowel as the bowel wall does not appear thickened, and there is no evidence of pneumatosis or portal venous air.
There is no free intraperitoneal air.
Diverticulosis of the remaining colonic stump is seen without diverticulitis.
Diffuse atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta, with an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm is unchanged.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is persistent thickening along the anterior right side of the bladder.
Rectal stump appears diffusely thickened as noted previously.
No pelvic  lymphadenopathy is definitively identified.
Previously noted metastatic nodule in the pelvis is not as well appreciated on this study likely due to technical reasons.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is identified.
Persistent dilatation of the small bowel to the ileocecal valve.
Anasarca with bilateral pleural effusions and ascites.

**FINAL REPORT [**2144-6-26**]**     Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2144-6-26**]):    NO GROWTH.
10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..         Brief Hospital Course: This is a 82 year old male with bladder cancer requiring 4 resections and recently diagnosed metastatic squamous cell cancer involving the rectum.
He had continued nausea and poor appetite at home and did not pass stool or flatus through his ostomy.
# Partial small bowel obstruction/Ileus: Likely related to metastasis.
He was NPO with NGT and started on TPN for nutritional support.
His abdomen was slightly distended and round.
A CT ABD was done on [**2144-6-12**] and showed persistent dilatation of the small bowel, without a discrete transition point.
Although early or partial obstruction is difficult to exclude, the appearance is more consistent with an ileus.
The NGT output decreased over the next several days and he began having scant thick brown stool output from the ostomy.
His GI tract had poor function possibly secondary to tumor infiltration thought to invade the myenteric plexus with suspected ileus (per Surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**].
He was still having minimal stool output from the ostomy.
His abdominal exam was remarkable for significant distension, tympany and hypoactive bowel sounds.
On [**6-19**] evening pt had O2 desaturation episode and went into respiratory distress, sats in 70s on RA and was acutely tachypneic, code blue was called.
ABG 7.41/27/107/18 and CXR showed no clear infiltrates but looked like left pleural effusion.
LENI showed no DVTs.
An investigation of PE was not pursued as a clear cause of desaturation existed and hypoxia resolved.
CXR on [**6-21**] showed persistent cardiomegaly which was stable, bilateral pleural effusions and a left retrocardiac opacity.
He had no CP, SOB, abdominal pain or vomitting.
There has been no flatus or output in stoma since admission to the ICU.
Persistent dilatation of the small bowel to the ileocecal valve.
Anasarca with bilateral pleural effusions and ascites.
By [**6-24**] patient began to have stoma output with loose material of > 200cc per day.
There is no n/v.
# Bladder cancer requiring 4 resections and recently diagnosed metastatic squamous cell cancer involving the rectum.
Mr. [**Known lastname 34754**] case was discussed at UG and GI tumor boards and it was felt that the cancer most likely is of the urothelial origin.
# Elevated INR: INR continued to be elevated despite administration of Vitamin K.  A hematology consult was obtained.
They felt the possible causes of the patient's elevated coagulation studies include Coumadin overdose, malnutrition, and excessive heparin response; less likely possibilities include liver failure and acquired coagulation factor deficiencies.
The fact that the PT was elevated to a much greater degree than the PTT points to warfarin effect and/or and vitamin K deficiency.
It was felt that the patient's poor intake over the period of hospitalization and has likely resulted in underproduction of coagulation factors;  It was felt that patient's recent nausea and vomiting is unlikely secondary to brain metastases from his bladder cancer.
With this regimen, patient's INR became subtherapeutic and pt was restarted on 5mg of coumadin QD.
Due to erroneous adminstration of vitamin K in TPN, patient's INR again became subtherapeutic on [**6-23**].
CV: He is V-paced with chronic A-fib.
He has known chronic systolic heart failure.
LE edema/anasarca: Most likely due to metastatic disease.
LENI were done and negative for DVT.
The edema was likely related to metastatic disease, CHF (LVEF 25 - 30% from [**1-16**]) and low albumin.
This regimen may require an increase to 40 [**Hospital1 **] or IV lasix to improve pedal edema as patient has been volume even over [**6-23**] - [**6-26**].
Nutrition:  Patient was started on TPN on [**2144-6-11**], which was stopped [**1-11**] respiratory distress and was restarted on [**6-22**].
Atrial fibrillation - patient was rate controlled on Metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID.
Suspected UTI - Pt w/ episodes of urinary incontinence.
Patient with Hx of MRSA bacteremia.
Tachy/brady syndrome s/p pacer - patient was V paced at 70. .
Menthol-Cetylpyridinium 3 mg Lozenge [**Date Range **]: One (1) Lozenge Mucous membrane PRN (as needed) as needed for sore throat.
Phenol-Phenolate Sodium     Mouthwash [**Date Range **]: One (1) Spray Mucous membrane Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for sore throat.
Heparin, Porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe [**Month/Day (2) **]: One (1) ML Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Squamous cell carcinoma of the pelvis, likely of bladder origin Right Portacath placement Nausea, Vomiting Partial small bowel obstruction  Secondary: Chronic Systolic Heart Failure; EF 25-30%   Discharge Condition: Fair   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after your port line placement for Nausea, vomiting, and poor ostomy output.
While in the hospital you experienced ileus (inability to move yoru bowels) and respiratory distress requiring intensive care unit placement.
Your ileus was felt to be due to the cancer in of your bladder.
HTN and kidney disease medication - please HOLD your lisinopril dose until you follow-up with your PCP.
Should you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, new abdominal pain, n/v, cough, fever, chills, pain with urination or any other symptoms concerning to you, you should contact the facility staff for assisstance and facility physician.
It is recommended that patient complete 7 days of Vancomycin 1mg IV q24 hours for UTI Tx as he has Hx of MRSA bacteremia.
