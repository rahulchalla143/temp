#AML: He had neutropenic fever, which is why he is on Meropenem, Vancomycin.
He was afebrile for 10 days, and was thus taken off the Meropenem and Vancomycin prior to discharge, during which he remained afebrile.
His course has been complicated by a visit for the ICU from which he returned approximately 1 week ago; he had been in the ICU after having an increased oxygen requirement on the floor, [**Last Name (un) **], and noted decrease in his ejection fraction on Echo.
His echo revealed cardiomyopathy, with a depressed EF of 30%, but the source of his cardiomyopathy is unclear at this time.
BRIEF [**Hospital Unit Name 13533**]:  Respiratory Distress / Heart Failure - Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory distress in the setting of mild bump in cardiac enzymes (Troponin peak 0.11), new effusions on CXR, and non-specific Twave changes on EKG.
Echo demonstrated decreased poor systolic function (EF 35%).
The patient required imediate intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure.
The diagnostics and imaging point to pulmonary edema [**1-13**] to CHF in the setting of ACS, although given the patient's neutropenic status infection was also considered.
HTN - On transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient's antihypertensives had been held given his low blood pressure.
Following the patient's extubation, the patient became hypertensive to SBP 160s-180s.
He also had a vasovagal bradycardic episode and triggered for HRs in the 40s.
He was monitored on tele with no further events.
He was seen by cardiology, who recommended patient be restarted on metoprolol and diovan for treatment of hypertension and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.
This was thought to be multifactorial, [**1-13**] to to nephrotoxic chemotherapeutics and due to poor renal perfusion in the setting of heart failure / ACS.
He did not have any metabolic derangements and his renal function gradually improved to 1.3 by the time of his transfer back to the BMT service.
