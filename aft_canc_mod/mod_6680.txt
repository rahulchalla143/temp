The sarcomatous component is low grade with no heterologous elements seen.
The vast majority of tumor burden seen in this case is in the "uterine tumor" specimen.
There is a 2 mm focus of tumor present in the myometrium.
She was found to not be in acute renal failure.
The catheter was continued as she still was having urinary retention.
They felt that although the patient had a history of CABG she did not need to have an echo prior to surgery given her excellent functional status at baseline.
