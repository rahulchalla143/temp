However, she worsened (increasing difficulty maintaining sats and c/o abdominal pain).
Per report, pt uses bipap at night and was noted to have decreased breath sounds on the L.side.
She reported dyspnea with speaking.
Given CT findings, of LLL collapse with occlusion of L.main stem bronchus, and possible LUL PNA, IP was made aware of pt.
Pt also reported vague upper abdominal pain and was given vanco and zosyn.
See MICU admit note for complete details, breifly, 66F with h/o severe COPD (4L O2 @ home, baseline sats high 80s), OSA (bipap 20/5), with chronic cough, and dyspnea since [**1-3**].
She was treated at OSH with levaquin, and trasferred to rehab, where she was ultimately started on vancomycin/cefepime by report, but continued to worsen with regard to her respiratory status, prompting referral to [**Hospital1 18**], where she was noted to be acutely hypoxic (74%RA), and intubated in the ED for "airway proteection"  CT CHEST revealed LLL atalectasis with occlusion of the left mainstem bronchus.
Bronch performed, which revealed severe tracehobronchomalacia main distal tracehea, copious thick secretions left mainstain and segmental bronchi.
At present, she has no specific complaints, and states her breathing is much improved compared to her baseline (confirmed per her daughters).

Left lower lobe collapse with occlusion of the left main stem bronchus of unclear etiology.
While findings could be secondary to mucous secretions a left main stem bronchial lesion remains of concern and cannot be excluded.
Small area of focal consolidation in the left upper lobe may represent a small pneumonia.
Partial left upper lobe collapse.
Severe emphysematous changes.
Hyperdense right mid-polar and upper pole renal lesions incompletely characterized on this non-contrast CT.
Recommend further evaluation with a renal ultrasound on a non-urgent basis.
6 mm hypodensity in the left thyroid lobe.

Course: 66 year old woman with past medical history significant for COPD on home 02, OSA, TBM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, h.o PE, PNA who presents with hypoxia.
# ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE (hypoxic and hypercarbic) / health care associated bacterial pneumonia / severe COPD - patient with COPD, on 4L home o2, bipap.
Pt admitted in the setting of recent community aquired pneumonia treated with levoquin.
Additionally, she completed a course of antibiotics for health care associated pneumonia (HCAP) with vancomycin/cefepime at [**Hospital1 **].
On admission, CXR and CT showed LLL collapse with occlusion of the L.mainstem bronchus.
Patient's hypercarbia and 02 sat were slightly worse from her baseline, and she was intubated in the ED for airway protection.
Bronchoscopy was performed upon admission, which showed thick purulent material which was suctioned, severe tracheobronchomalacia.
Respiratory viral antigen was significant for positive parainfluenza, however this was not felt to require therapy per pulmonary team.
Likely post-viral HAP with a resistant organism leading to complete mucous plugging of left mainstem.
Of note, when she was placed on NC, 02 sat increased to 100% but she became somnolent with presumed hypercarbia.
She was noted to have transient hypoxia after the procedure, and was monitored overnight in the ICU.
She returned to the medical service on [**2192-3-1**], where she was noted to have episodes of bloody sputum.
Given ongoing dyspnea, pt was taken for repeat bronchoscopy on [**2192-3-7**] which showed no evidence of pneumonia, minor clot at the site of tracheal stent, but no other obstruction.
after discussion with the interventinal pulmonary service and her primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was to consult the palliative care service to manage her subjective symptoms of dyspnea with narcotics, before using benzodiazapenes.
it was felt that there were no further medical options for managing her dyspnea at this time.
she was started on morphine liquid per palliative care service for symptoms of subjective dyspnea, which worked well but was initially associated with itching.
morphine was also beneficial for intermittent symptoms of abdominal pain as noted below.
per the palliative care service, given her prognosis, morphine should be titrated up as needed to treat subjective symptoms of dyspnea.
the patient and her family understood that she has limited options with regard to further management of her severe lung disease.
should her symptoms worsen, she expressed the desire to consider repeat hospitalization for treatment of pneumonia, including intubation for respiratory failure.
# tracheobronchomalacia - Patient has severe disease and was scheduled for IP stent the week after admission.
Mildly blood sputum was noted after the procedure which was felt to local trauma, and therapeutic heparin / coumadin.
given ongoing sensation of dyspnea, and persistent LLL collapse after initial bronchoscopy, IP service was consulted again, and repeat bronchoscopy on [**2192-3-7**] showed patent stent, without evidence of recurrence of pneumonia.
# history of pulmonary embolism: Patient is on coumadin at home in the setting of remote PE in [**2190**], with subsequent L UE DVT (though felt to be catheter related, pt and family elected to continue lifelong anticoagulation).
# diastolic congestive heart failure - pt's dose of lasix held as below.
# chronic renal insufficiency - baseline creatinine ~2, up to 2.6 in ICU, thus lasix was held, with improvement to 1.9 on [**3-3**], at which time she was restarted on lasix 80mg po qdaily, then titrated up to home reigmen 120mg po qam; 80mg po qpm.
given ongoing dyspnea, and volume overload on clinical exam, diuresis was increased to 120mg po qam with prn iv lasix 80mg iv given once daily starting [**3-6**], with resultant negative fluid balance of -500cc to 1L on [**2-25**], and [**3-8**].
# sinus tachycardia - likely multifactorial, but has been chronic, baseline HR 100-120, with contribution from COPD, hypoxia, anxiety.
on max dose of diltiazem, and prefered to avoid beta blockade given COPD, however, has diastolic CHF which could benefit from optimizing rate control.
# anemia, chronic disease - HCT stable at discharge.
HCT = 30 on admit -> 25 nadir, had single trace guaic positive brown stool [**3-1**], but otherwise, likely [**2-28**] poor nutrition, chronic disease, and iron, (on repletion), along with phlebotomy.
Her HCT drop was felt also likely due to dilution in the setting of recieving 2L IVF on [**3-10**] and 2L IVF on [**3-1**].
Her stools remained guaic negative.
# leukocytosis - WBC noted to be rising [**2-27**], unclear if [**2-28**] pneumonia or steroids, peak of 16 on [**2192-3-3**] but pulmonary status continued to improve as above, with tapering of steroid dose as above.
Pt denied diarrhea, dysuria, and no other new drugs other than antibiotics.
Repeat CXR stable without evidence of pnuemonia.
CT ABD/PELVIS obtained given intermittent abdominal pain below, without acute process.
her leukocytosis resolved without further intervention, and was down to 8 on day of discharge.
# bacterial urinary tract infection / fungal urinary tract infection- +UA on [**2-27**], in setting of foley, and on abx for HAP as above.
Given leukocytosis, repeat UA sent which showed yeast again, and elevated WBCs (691 on [**3-9**]), as well as persistant RBCs.
Given significant leukocytosis, and persistant funguria (>100K grown on [**3-11**] Urine Cx), with ongoing urinary retention, pt was started on 2 week course of fluconazole on [**3-13**].
# abdominal pain / urinary retention - pt with intermittent episodes of abdominal discomfort with typically resolved completely with bowel movements.
CT ABD/PELVIS obtained over [**2192-3-3**] given recurrent abdominal pain without acute pathology.
most likely etiology was felt [**2-28**] constipation vs urinary retention, however symptoms typical resolved without intervention.
most likely etiology of retention is narcotic usage, and deconditioning.
An appointment was made for her given the presence of hematuria (which may have been secondary to coagulopathy, and foley placement), and smoking history, however this may be cancelled should these symptoms resolve.
# coagulopathy - INR elevated to 4.2 on discharge, coumadin dose of 2mg po qdaily was therefore discontinued.
# OSA - continued BiPAP.
her lantus dose was decreased from 44U QHS to 25U QHS, given her poor oral intake and now reduced oral steroid dose.
# hypothyroid - continued on home regimen of synthroid.
# depression - continued on citalopram.
# GERD - continued PPI.
# FEN - pt with poor oral intake, which improved with encouragement.
her insulin regimen was adjusted as above given her poor oral intake, felt largely [**2-28**] lack of appetitite.
# osteoporosis - continued calcium, and calcitonin.
# ACESS - L UE midline was placed [**2-27**].
# CODE - discussed with patient, husband, daughter [**Name2 (NI) **], and pt made DNR in the setting of pulseless event.
