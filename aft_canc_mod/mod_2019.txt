[**2122-6-29**] Bladder Pressure: 36  Brief Hospital Course: HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA, ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Mr. [**Known lastname 42512**] is a 72yo man w/ progressive HCC with metastatic liver lesions who was initially admitted for treatment of hyponatremia and possible initiation of chemotherapy.
On [**2122-6-28**] he was transferred to the ICU for a single episode of BRBPR that started after he strained to urinate.
His bleeding was thought to be from a large external hemorrhoid, and it stopped on its own.
Cystoscopy was performed on [**2122-6-28**] to verify there was no bladder outlet obstruction.
For the several days prior to ICU transfer he had worsening renal function, thought to be mulitfactorial (both contrast nephropathy and hepatorenal syndrome); however, his renal function acutely declined the two days prior to his death.
Ultimately it was felt that his worsening ascites was contributing to an abdominal compartment syndrome (bladder pressure was 36 on [**2122-6-29**]), causing decreased venous return with hypoperfusion as well as possibly effectively obstructing the ureters bilaterally.
A diagnostic tap showed a SAAG of 1.1, which was borderline for elevated portal hypertension.
The morning of [**2122-6-29**], he developed sudden respiratory distress in the setting of anuria and worsening ascites; he was electively intubated.
He became profoundly hypotensive and was placed on dopamine and albumin.
On [**2122-6-30**], the patient expired after becoming profoundly hypotensive and ultimately pulseless.
