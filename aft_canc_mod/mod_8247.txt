Of note, he was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 35870**] for LE edema with was felt to be due to decreased lasix dose and hypoalbuminemia (LENIs neg, no pelvic vein compression on CT abd/pelv., TTE w/ mild worsening inferior hypokinesis).
He was treated for a positive UCx with ciprofloxacin and notably was found to have urinary retnetion, felt to be due to prostate ca s/p XRT.
Since [**Month/Year (2) **], patient has remained relatively hypotensive while at rehabilitation, BPs as low as 80s systolic.
Over the past week, noted urinary retention and dysuria.
On day of transfer, c/o of increasing malaise and weakness, leg swelling and heaviness, requiring the use of a wheelchair.
ECG showed NSR with RBBB and old inferior MI; no evidence of acute ischemia or electrical alternans.
CXR showed increasing L effusion and atelectasis.
He was then started on dopamine with improvement in BPs to 130s systolic and tachycardia to 120s.
He underwent Bedside US which showed moderate pericardial effusion, pulsus was not checked.
Past Medical History: - mantle cell lymphoma (s/p chemotherapy, 6 cycles Bendamustine and Rituxan - last session [**2171-10-28**], last cycle of rituximab Day 1: [**2172-2-24**] Cycle end: [**2172-3-22**]) - rheumatic heart disease with acute rheumatic fever (subsequent mitral regurgitation - posteriorly directed jet of mild to moderate ([**2-3**]+) mitral regurgitation on [**2171-5-17**]) - s/p left scapular fracture - s/p right first toe fracture - s/p right lower extremity osteomyelitis (age 30 years old) - gout - s/p volar plate injury of 5th digit - Divertiulitis with abdominal sepsis ([**2149**]) - hypertension - hyperlipidemia - allergic rhinitis - cervical & lumbar disc disease (with right sciatica) - prostate adenocarcinoma ([**Doctor Last Name **] 6, s/p XRT [**2158**]) - DM2 - noninsulin dependent - vitamin D deficiency - s/p ORIF left ankle fracture - c. difficile infection  Social History: Lives with his wife and two children.
Former maintanance, machinist and shipyard worker with asbestos exposure.
Family History: Negative for any type of cancer, leukemia, or lymphoma; however, his sister has anemia and significant weight loss.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: Vitals:  Pulsus 10mmHg General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, dMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP 8cm, no LAD CV: RR, normal S1 + S2 Lungs: decr breath sounds on LLL, no egophony Abdomen: soft, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: 3+ pitting edema to knees, 2+ DP Neuro: a/ox3, MOYb intact, normal language.
Since the prior exam, there is interval increase in the left pleural effusion.
A small right pleural effusion is redemonstrated.
Bibasilar consolidations are likely attributable to compressive atelectasis.
Degenerative changes at the right shoulder are redemonstrated.
Degenerative changes in the T-spine also again seen.
Compressive lower lobe atelectasis.
In unchanged manner, there is moderate cardiomegaly with a relatively extensive left pleural effusion and a left atelectasis.
A newly appeared minimal right pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
No evidence of pneumonia.
ECHO Due to [**2172-6-4**] suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Very small pericardial effusion, without any evidence of hemodynamic significance.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2172-4-13**], the findings arppear similar, although inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis is not appreciated on today's focused study.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 yo M with Mantle cell lymphoma (on bendamustine and Rituxan), atrial flutter, tachy-CM (last EF 45-50%), recent UTI and episode of urinary retention, prostate cancer s/p XRT [**2158**] who was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for LE edema, who presented from [**Hospital1 1501**] for an evaluation of LE edema, urinary retention and hypotension.
# Mantle cell lymphoma.
However, as hospitalization went on, became clear that pleural effusions and pericardial effusions were malignant in nature.
CT torso on [**6-14**] showed worsening lymphoma.
MRI showed no CNS disease.
Persistent pressor requirement and unable to get off vent (had been intubated for pericardiocentesis - see below) with negative infectious work-up raised concern that all problems stemming from overwhelming lymphoma.
On [**6-18**] after 4 days of steroids with no response oncology met with family who had expressed desires to not have prolonged intubation or life support.
Patient admitted initially to [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU on [**2172-6-3**] with hypotension, tachycardia, low CVP and elevated SVO2.
Source of sepsis is most likely Pseudomonal UTI.
No evidence of prostatitis on rectal exam.
Finished course of meropenem for UTI but later in hospitalization when in MICU7 (see below) more issues with hypotension requiring pressors so placed back on vanco and continued on meropenem empirically for HCAP.
Warfarin stopped to allow proceedures and on [**6-8**] the pt had diagnostic/therapeutic L thoracentesis by IP revealing exudative effusions (pleural LDH 354, serum 445) with +cytology.
Due to concerns that this and LE edema due to volume overload, cardiology was consulted and recommended transfer to [**Hospital Ward Name **] on the cardiology floor for a lasix drip.
# Respiratory distress: No significant breathing issues initially.
EKG showed increased rate but no acute ST changes.
Pt was transferred to the MICU7 for respiratory distress.
In MICU7 the pt was started on Bipap, continued on lasix gtt with bolus 80mg without significant urine output.
TTE showed new moderate pericardial effusion, EF decreased to 45-50%.
IP placed pigtail on left on [**2172-6-12**] to drain pleural effusions and hopefully improve respiratory status.
Pleural fluid again with high LDH suggestive of malignancy.
# Hypotension: Had initially been hypotensive presumed to be due to urosepsis (see above).
As above, TTE with new pericardial effusion.
Initially cardiology did not think pericardial drainage needed has no evidence that hypotension due to poor cardiac output and SVO2s were high (distributive shock).
Continued to require pressors and later cath (see below) didn't indicate that shock due to tamponade.
Grew rapidly in size and cardiology ultimately took to cath lab for pericardiocentesis.
However, cath showed no abnormal pressure elevations in RV arguing against any tamponade.
This combined with fact that growing mass was obstructing pericardium led to aborting of attempt at pericardiocentesis.
# Atrial flutter: In sinus rhythm and Aflutter intermittently throughout hospitalization.
Beta blocker was held due to hypotension and warfarin due to need for proceedures.
# Code Status: Initially full code although family expressing that patient would not want prolonged ventilation or life support.
When became apparent that most of sickness due to overwhelming lymphoma, decision made to withdraw medical care except that focused on comfort.
