No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Interval worsening of multifocal pneumonia with partial right middle lobe atelectasis.
New mild pulmonary edema.
Stable small loculated left pleural effusion and resolution of right pleural effusion after bilateral chest tube removal.
No evidence of acute hemorrhage or shift.
Bilateral mastoid air cell opacification, unchanged.
Improved aeration to right middle lobe and right lower lobe, however, there is worsening multifocal predominantly ground-glass opacities involving the left lower lobe, right middle lobe, and portions of the right upper lobe.
In this patient with secretions within the trachea and proximal bronchi, it is most worrisome for underlying aspiration pneumonitis/or worsening pneumonia.
Non infectious etiolgies for this appearance include pulmonary edema or hemorrhage.

No acute intracranial process, including no hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect.
Opacification of mastoid air cells, and dependent secretions in the sphenoid sinuses.
Mild fat stranding is identified anterior to the left carotid space, no frank evidence of fluid collection or drainable lesion.
