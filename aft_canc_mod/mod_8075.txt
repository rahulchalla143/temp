Patient has also had occassional chills and mild SOB.
Presented to her PCP's office, where an large painful mass was noted in her right neck.

Soft tissue mass just deep to the right sternocleidomastoid corresponds to lesion seen on ultrasound; incompletely assessed without contrast.
Findings highly concerning for malignancy, possibly squamous carcinoma.
----------- CXR ([**2152-12-14**]): No significant interval change.
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
----------- Neck Soft tissue Ultrasound ([**2152-12-14**]): Palpable lump in the lower right neck is an abnormal lymph node that measures 38 x 18 x 25 mm.
It has some vascularity and shows marked irregularity.
Other abnormal lymph nodes are present in this region, but are considerably smaller.
This measures approximately 4 x 3 cm in the transverse and is associated with an enlarged lymph node in this region also.
No evidence of abnormality is seen on the left side.
These appearances suggest a malignancy arising out of the region of the trachea or vocal cords with metastatic lymph nodes.
----------- CYTOLOGY:  Lymph node (right neck), fine needle aspirate: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent with squamous cell carcinoma.
There was premature spillover with evidence of pharyngeal swallow delay.
Aspiration of nectar thick liquids was also noted related to extensive residua in the piriform sinuses.
Please see the full speech and swallow service report in OMR for further details.
----------- CT CHEST:  New sub-4-mm right upper and lower lobe pulmonary nodules should be evaluated with chest CT in one year.
No additional suspicious pulmonary lesions.
Large right neck mass not fully imaged; see neck CT from [**2152-12-14**] for additional details.
---------- MRI HEAD/NECK: FINDINGS: Head images demonstrate prominent ventricles and sulci, likely age related and involutional in nature.
On the diffusion-weighted sequences, there is no evidence of acute ischemic disease or acute infarctions.
The study of the neck demonstrates soft tissue laryngeal mass on the left, causing narrowing of the airway, the right neck mass is not clearly identified in this examination, please consider obtaining additional images under conscious sedation or under anesthesia for further characterization.
Irregular, heterogeneously enhancing, lobulated mass seems to originate in the left piriform sinus and crosses midline to fill the right superior piriform sinus.
It also fills the laryngeal ventricles, causing significant narrowing of the airway, and also invades the glottis, aryepiglottic folds, true vocal cords, with only subtle extension to the false vocal cords.
Another right neck mass at the level of C4 anterior to carotid artery and SCM muscle may be an extension of the laryngeal mass or a nodal metastasis.
A third mass does not appear to be contiguous with the first two, and lies behind the right SCM with possible invasion into the muscle.
There is considerable compressive mass effect on the right jugular vein with complete encasement of the right external carotid artery.

This symptom cluster was concerning for malignancy with likely SCC with unknown primary.
CT scan highly suspicious of malignancy and showed possible airway compromise.
Initially admitted to the MICU due to concern for airway stability.
ENT was consulted who performed laryngoscopy and though patient most likely had supraglotic SCC with bilateral metastatis.
She received Dexamethasone 10 mg IV to help with swelling of neck mass and dysphagia.
Nutrition: The patient described difficulty swallowing on admission which was believed to be related to her large neck mass.
Her nutrition requirment was two cans of ensure (480 mL) TID with 100mL free water bolus with each feeding.
She was noted to have increased residuals at times - if continues would consider running continuous tube feeds at 65cc/hr.
Anxiety/pain: The patient was noted to have a significant and appropriate amount of anxiety regarding SCC diagnosis.
Once it was determined that the patinet was not having signficant pain her morphine was discontinued and the patient continued to recieve tylenol PRN.
Shortness of breath: CT chest showed RLL consolidation and with history of COPD and wheezing on exam, she was treated with azithromycin IV 500 mg for 5 days for question CAP.
She was given IV dexamethasone for neck mass swelling and continued on her home tiotropium and albuterol q4.
The shortness in breath improved after these interventions and the patient continued to recieve albuterol nebulizers PRN and tiotropium Cap daily.
Became hypertensive to ~150-160 systolic off medications.
# Urinary Retention:  Patient was initially treated for a UTI on admission.
An MR [**Name13 (STitle) 1093**] was attempted, but due to the patient's extreme intolerance of the procedure as well as an aborted attempt at fiberoptic intubation due to bleeding of the mass no spinal cord imaging was possible.
Contrast Allergy:  Patient had a documented contrast allergy of unknown type or severity.
Patient recieved pretreatment with prednisone and benadryl without incident or minor reaction.
Constipation:  The patient developed constipation after being transfered to the OMED service without a bowel movement for greater than 9 days.
She had significant perseverative behavior including asking for pain medications and significant psychomotor aggitation.
As she had a history of severe parkinsonian symptoms in the past zyprexa dosing was not changed and patient was treated sparingly with zyprexa for behavior control.
her perseverative beahviors were felt to be the etiology of both her constipation and urinary retention as she was observed on the commode on several occasions unable to focus on initiating a bowel movement or urinating.
Tobacconism:  Patient had a chronic tobacco dependence on admission with a pack a day habit.
Transitional Issues: - Port suture to be removed [**1-5**] by any physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) **]4-mm right upper and lower lobe pulmonary nodules should be evaluated with chest CT in one year.
- Patient is a high risk intubation even with fiberoptic visulization due to friability of the lyrangal mass, would need trach or cricotomy for emergent intubation.
