Admission Date:  [**2114-8-20**]       Discharge Date:  [**2114-9-4**]  Date of Birth:   [**2047-1-30**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Location (un) 259**] MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old man with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, Wegener's granulomatosis and myelodysplasia (please see past medical history below) who presented with chest pain over the prior three days, as well as fevers and chills.
Regarding fevers, the patient has a history of Wegener's granulomatosis with treatment with prednisone (still on 5 mg q day) and Cytoxan (discontinued in [**2113-12-18**]) and several admissions for fever and neutropenia in the past.
On presentation for this admission, the patient reported having had low grade temperatures and odynophagia for approximately three days prior to admission, as well as mild cough and fatigue.
Then, on the morning of admission, he reported having fevers to 104?????
While in the Emergency Department, the patient's systolic blood pressure dropped to the 80s and this was accompanied by lightheadedness and left sided chest pain.
Regarding the patient's chest pain, the patient has an extensive history of coronary artery disease and is followed for this by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (see below for more detail).
The patient reported substernal chest pain with swallowing that he was felt was dissimilar to past anginal pain.
The pain did not radiate, was not associated with dyspnea, palpitations, nausea or vomiting.
However, in the Emergency Department, in the setting of hypertension, the patient's reported onset of his left sided chest tightness that was indeed similar to his prior anginal pain.
An electrocardiogram in the Emergency Department showed ST depressions in V2 through V5, as well as T-wave inversions in leads 1, AVL and V1 through V6.
The patient was given aspirin and sublingual nitroglycerin with improvement in his left sided chest pain from 6 out of 10 in severity to 1 out of 10 in severity in the Emergency Department.
His pain resolved by the time he arrived in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Coronary artery disease     A.
Angiography significant for occlusion of the LAD mid segment with a patent left internal mammary artery and a patent distal LAD stent.
Old RCA occlusion.
Mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy was seen with moderate depression of LV systolic function.
Dyskinesis of the basal inferior and mid inferior segments was noted, as was hypokinesis of the basal inferolateral and mid inferolateral portions.
The patient was found to have moderate mitral regurgitation.
Hypertension 5.
Hyperlipidemia  OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS: 1.
Vitamin E  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's brother has coronary artery disease.
A urinalysis revealed no red blood cells, no white blood cells, no bacteria and no epithelials.
Bibasilar interstitial coarse reticular opacities were seen.
No acute processes were appreciated.
Electrocardiogram in the Emergency Department:  Sinus tachycardia at 100 beats per minute, axis 0, intervals normal with T-wave inversions in leads 1, AVL, V2 through V6.
ST depressions were seen in leads V2 through V5.
Compared with prior study from [**2114-6-30**], T-wave inversions and ST depressions are new.
Electrocardiogram in the MICU:  Sinus tachycardia at 100 beats per minute, axis 0, intervals normal.
OTHER LABS AND IMAGING OF NOTE FOR THIS CURRENT ADMISSION: Transthoracic echocardiogram:  As will be discussed below, the patient received a TTE on [**2114-8-24**] for evaluation of his heart function following non Q-wave myocardial infarction as well as for evaluation of possible endocarditis in the setting of fevers and neutropenia.
There was no evidence of endocarditis found; left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated at 55%.
Left ventricular hypertrophy was noted.
Wall motion abnormalities were noted as hypokinesis at the basal inferoseptal and mid inferoseptal portions.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy:  As will also be noted below, the patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy on or about [**8-24**] for evaluation of possible esophagitis, again in the setting of neutropenia and fevers, as well as a history of odynophagia.
The esophagogastroduodenoscopy was negative for esophagitis.
CT scan of the sinuses, [**2114-8-27**], revealed no evidence of acute sinus disease.
As noted above, during a hypotensive episode, the patient developed chest pain.
CARDIAC:  The patient ruled in for a non Q-wave myocardial infarction by troponin levels.
He was continued on captopril, Lopressor and Aspirin; subsequently, the aspirin was discontinued for very low platelet levels.
In terms of the patient's rate and rhythm status, the patient has a history of AT and NST; initially his amiodarone was discontinued upon admission for the possible risk of bone marrow suppression.
Cardiology felt that the overall chronology of the patient's onset of neutropenia was not compatible with his starting amiodarone and that furthermore, his history of atrial tachycardia and NST warranted restarting amiodarone.
The patient's hemodynamic status was stabilized over the first day or so of his admission, such that he was no longer hypertensive, nor did he exhibit any chest pain or electrocardiogram changes following his above mentioned course.
As noted above, the patient underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram for evaluation of endocarditis; this study was negative for endocarditis.
The patient also underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy for evaluation of possible esophagitis in the setting of neutropenia and odynophagia; this study was likewise negative.
The patient continued to have intermittent fevers with a T-max on [**8-25**] of 102.0??????
Thereafter, the patient remained afebrile for a time until, on [**8-30**], he was noted to have a temperature of 100.9??????.
At this point, as with the remainder of the patient's hospitalization, no clear source for a fever was found, however it was felt on [**8-30**] that his resurgence of temperature was most likely due to possible cellulitis and/or intravenous site infection.
However, the patient continued intravenous vancomycin through the remainder of his hospitalization for treatment of the possible intravenous site infection.
The patient's right forearm intravenous site exhibited some tenderness, erythema and a palpable cord.
These signs and symptoms slowly diminished over the ensuing days up to the patient's discharge from the hospital.
From this point on, the patient did not exhibit frank fever spikes and his intravenous sites as noted above slowly improved.
HEMATOLOGY:  The hem/onc service was consulted and followed the patient for issues pertaining to his history of myelodysplasia.
The patient was transfused several units of packed red blood cells over the course of his hospitalization; this was fully consistent with his periodic requirement for red blood cell transfusion related to the above noted condition.
It should be noted that the patient did have several bouts of diarrhea for which he was found to be Clostridium difficile negative on a number of tests.
His diarrhea eventually subsided and as noted above he continued to have good p.o.
intake with no nausea or vomiting.
On the day of discharge, his vital signs were stable and he was afebrile with a temperature of 98.1??????.
His intravenous cellulitis revealed some continued palpable cords with decreased erythema and tenderness.
The patient very much wished to go home after his protracted hospital stay and following much discussion with the various consult services and primary team it was felt that the patient was indeed healthy enough to go home, so long as he had adequate and intense follow up in the near future.
Neutropenia 2.
Coronary artery disease, status post non Q-wave myocardial infarction 3.
Myelodysplasia  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  For the most part, the patient was discharged home on the above noted outpatient medication regimen.
Changes included the fact that his aspirin had been discontinued due to his low platelet count.
