Admission Date:  [**2157-1-3**]     Discharge Date:  [**2157-1-11**]   Service:  [**Hospital1 **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80 year-old female from [**Hospital3 **] facility with a past medical history significant for hypertension, congestive heart failure (last ejection fraction in [**2149**] of 35%), atrial fibrillation on Coumadin and rate control with beta blocker, history of multiple transient ischemic attacks and two cerebrovascular accidents with a recent admission to [**Hospital1 190**] for a gastrointestinal bleed from a colonic AVM status post cauterization who presents to the Emergency Department three days after discharge from the hospital on Coumadin and Lasix with a recurrence of bright red blood per rectum.
During previous hospitalization from [**12-22**] to [**12-30**] the patient was treated with multiple units of packed red blood cells, had episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and underwent endoscopy and colonoscopy.
During the hospitalization she was diagnosed with multiple gastric ulcers, sigmoid diverticulosis and a colonic AVM that was cauterized.
In addition, there was questionable malt lymphoma seen on pathology from biopsy of the gastric ulcerations.
However, on discharge given her increased risk for cerebrovascular accident off of anticoagulation she was discharged on Coumadin with a Lovenox bridge.
She does have a positive history of fatigue and decreased po intake for greater then one months time without significant weight loss.
Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 35%.
Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin and Metoprolol.
History of multiple transient ischemic attacks.
History of cerebrovascular accidents.
Questionable malt lymphoma on recent gastric biopsy.
History of non ST elevation myocardial infarction.
Mid to moderate mitral regurgitation, mild aortic regurgitation and left ventricular hypertrophy seen on transesophageal echocardiogram in [**2149**].
Coronary artery disease.
Significant for dry mucous membranes.
No peripheral edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is an 80 year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, recent gastrointestinal bleed with possible malt lymphoma who presents with recurrent bright red blood per rectum.
The patient received an upper endoscopy that revealed nonbleeding gastric ulcers and biopsies were taken, a negative red blood cell scan and a colonoscopy that revealed nonbleeding AVM.
However, prior to discharge the patient was started on low dose Coumadin given her increase for cerebrovascular accident and she had no further bleeding.
During previous hospitalization gastric biopsy showed possible malt lymphoma.
History of atrial fibrillation:  In previous hospitalization the patient had rapid atrial fibrillation, however, during this hospitalization her heart rate was well controlled.
History of cerebrovascular accidents:  During hospitalization the patient had an episode of acute onset of numbness and paresthesias in the left lower extremities associated with transient weakness.
Symptoms appeared to be consistent with transient ischemic attack.
An MRA showed small recent infarct within the right middle cerebral artery territory involving the superolateral right temporal lobe, old infarcts in the left frontal and parietal lobes, left frontal, parietal, cerebellar, occipital regions.
MRA showed poor visualization of the distal right PCA.
Neurology interpreted these results as possible arterial stenosis.
The patient's symptoms resolved within resolved within a half an hour and there was no residual weakness.
Given evidence of the patient's hypercoagulability off of anticoagulation she was restarted on Coumadin at a lower dose then she was previously on without bridging heparin or Lovenox.
She was kept in the hospital for a few days for observation to make sure that she did not have any bleeding complications.
The hope is that she will be less likely to have a recurrence of a gastrointestinal bleed from this new level and her colonic AVM will have time to heal.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable without recurrence of gastrointestinal bleed, hemodynamically stable, hematocrit stable around 30, tolerating po diet, walking with a steady gait occasional with a cane and with an INR of 1.2.
Multiple gastric ulcers.
Probable new cerebrovascular accident versus transient ischemic attack.
Atrial fibrillation.
Congestive heart failure.
History of thyroid nodule.
History of non ST elevation myocardial infarction.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, mild aortic regurgitation.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
History of falls walks with a cane in the right hand at baseline.
History of transient ischemic attacks.
Coronary artery disease.
