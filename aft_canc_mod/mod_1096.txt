# Thrombocytopenia: In the setting of myelodysplastic syndrome and recent admission for ITP, her plt counts have improved.
# Eosinophilia: Patient with diagnosis of ?myelodysplastic syndrome (see heme/onc note from [**2123-1-19**]) and worsening eosinophilia despite treatment for two weeks with high-dose steroids.
No further workup was pursued in the acute inpatient setting.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine was up to 1.6 on admission from baseline of 1.3.
# H/o Atrial Fibrillation: She remained in sinus.
# Prophylaxis: with pneumoboots given thrombocytopenia, PPI per home regimen, bowel regimen prn # Code: full # Communication: - [**Doctor First Name 794**] (dtr): [**Telephone/Fax (1) 35484**] # Disposition: was admitted to ICU given transient hypotension, but improved dramatically and was quickly called out.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 35479**], You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath.
You were also found to have a fever and low blood pressure.
