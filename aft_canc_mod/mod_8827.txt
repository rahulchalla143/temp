He had an echocardiogram which showed severe aortic stenosis and an EF of 55-60%.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] and underwent cardiac catheterization on [**10-30**], which showed an A-V gradient of 63 mm Hg and aortic valve area of 0.35 cm squared, right coronary artery was 60% stenosed proximally, left main to be normal, left anterior descending artery with 60% stenosis in the mid vessel and left circumflex normal.
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma which was "low grade" and he is status post chemotherapy.
Degenerative joint disease.
Status post prostate shaving.
ALLERGIES:  Has no known drug allergies.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On admission, he had no recent visual changes, no dysphagia, occasional shortness of breath with walking.
He has no palpitations, no chest pain.
He has no melena and no hematochezia.
He does have nocturia x1.
He has no weakness.
Does occasionally experience numbness in his left leg with prolonged sitting secondary to his spinal stenosis.
He has no history of CVA nor TIA and no history of vein stripping.
His neck is supple with no JVD, no bruits, and carotid pulses are 1+ bilaterally.
His heart is regular, rate, and rhythm with a 4/6 systolic ejection murmur.
The skin shows no rashes and no abrasions.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2109-10-31**], patient underwent carotid ultrasound which showed bilateral internal carotid stenoses of less than 40%.
He had no events prior to going to the operating room and on [**2109-11-1**], he was taken to the operating room for an aortic valve replacement with a #21 mm CE pericardial valve and coronary artery bypass grafting x1 of the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery.
On postoperative day #2, he was noted to have decreasing cardiac index over the course of the day, and a cardiac echocardiogram was ordered.
This revealed global hypokinesis with an EF of about 40%.
He was noted to have left hemiplegia after being in AFib.
He did receive CT of the head which showed evidence of right MCA stroke, but no bleed.
He was cardioverted to sinus rhythm with 200 joule shock because the AFib was concurrent with the increasing cardiac index and he did return to sinus rhythm.
He began working with Physical Therapy more aggressively and on postoperative day #9, he was noted to have UTI and was started on Levaquin.
He was noted on postoperative day #12 to have left sided effusion by chest x-ray.
He eventually on postoperative day #14 went for ultrasound guided thoracentesis on the left side.
His followup chest x-ray showed no signs of pneumothorax.
His lungs are clear at the apices, but decreased breath sounds at the bases.
His sternal wound is stable and his incisions are clean, dry, and intact.
His chest x-ray did show small bilateral pleural effusions.
Status post aortic valve replacement with a #21 pericardial valve and coronary artery bypass graft x1 with a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery on [**11-1**].
Postoperative atrial fibrillation with eventual sinus bradycardia secondary to amiodarone and Lopressor.
