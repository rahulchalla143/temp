Lyme Serology: Negative --------------   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 104435**] is a 60 year-old female with multiple comorbidities who presented with a swollen, tender, warm left knee.
# Septic Arthritis: On arrival to the ED, the patient was afebrile (T 98.4) with a blood pressure of 144/40.
Physical exam was notable for a swollen left knee that was exquisitely tender to palpation.
Gram stain did not reveal any organisms.
She received vancomycin for a presumed septic joint and was taken to the operating room for arthrotomy and drain placement.
Tissue cultures and swab cultures did not reveal organisms on gram stain and showed no anaerobic growth to date as well as no fungal or acid fast bacilli.
The patient has remained afebrile throughout her hospital stay and without leukocytosis.
The patient reports that her knee pain is less than when she arrived.
She is able to move her left knee without significant pain and has been working with physical therapy.
Extensive discussion was given regarding repeat thoracentesis prior to discharge, but patient had good range of motion at the joint and felt pain had improved since admission, and it was uncelar what diagnostic benefit would be gained from a second thoracentesis.
Patient developed thrombocytopenia prior to discharge that was thought possibly [**1-12**] to vancomycin.
Vancomycin was initially continued given it was the optimal [**Doctor Last Name 360**] and patient had other possible agents (such as famotidine) that may have contributed to thrombocytopenia.
Hematology was consulted and felt thrombocytopenia was more likely related to marrow suppression than vancomycin toxicity, and vanco was continued.
She was monitored for several days and showed no progression of her thrombocytopenia on vancomycin.
- Would consider further thoracentesis if patient experiences increasing pain and swelling, or difficulty with range of motion.
# Thrombocytopenia: Patient with chronic mild thrombocytopenia and history of HIT - although no documented work-up in [**Hospital1 **] system.
Patient became progressively thrombocytopenic in house, and immediately prior to initial discharge had significant drop in platelets to 50's.
Patient was held in house for a further 5 days, and was without further decrease in her platelets.
No bleeding complications.
Medical record was very carefully examined and patient had no known exposure to heparin during this hospitalization.
Further, the decrease in platelets was felt not to be typical of HIT or reactivation of HIT in previously exposed patient.
Hematology was consulted who felt decrease was not likely HIT, and ultimately decided it was due to marrow suppression from infection.
Evidence for vancomycin toxicity was felt to be minimal as time course did not fit appropriately.
- Patient to follow-up with Hematology if thrombocytopenia persists after completion of her course of vancomycin.
# Allergic reaction/angioedema: After the arthrotomy/synovectomy, the patient's daughter noticed her face was more swollen than normal.
It is not clear which agents may have contributed to the swollen state, and whether her swelling was an allergic reaction at all or fluid accumulation in setting of not being dialyzed.
She did not appear to have any respiratory compromise, and there was no stridor on exam.
She did not complain of throat tightness or tongue swelling.
She was given diphenhydramine 12.5 IV q8hrs, famotidine 40 mg PO bid, and she received methylprednisolone once, though this was not continued given her history of DM1 and likely septic joint.
On the medicine floor, the patient did not exhibit any episodes of facial swelling or oropharyngeal discomfort.
ACE was restarted on the floor prior to discharge without difficulty.
Facial swelling resolved with dialysis and may have been due to volume overload rather than angioedema.
Furthermore, question whether there may be a component of central vein stenosis as patient had brachiocephalic veing - SVC stenosis that was dilated by IR.
# Nonresponsiveness at hemodialysis:  The patient became transiently hypotensive to the 70s and briefly non-responsive on [**5-11**].
She did not have any other episodes of non-responsiveness, though she does have a long history of these events at hemodialysis sessions.
# End stage renal disease on hemodialysis: Patient had an episode of hypotension and nonresponsiveness, as described above.
Cinacalcet was discontinued prior to discharge due to hypocalcemia.
Some residual swelling after removal, evaluated with ultrasound that showed a small hematoma.
Given history of untreated breast cancer on Arimidex concern was for progression of malignancy.
Swelling improved with dilation of brachiocephalic - SVC stenosis by IR, and exam was otherwise unremarkable.
# Type 1 diabetes mellitus: Remained stable.
Had some elevated finger sticks during the day and so AM NPH was increased to 12 units qAM.
# Hypertension: Remained stable.
The ACE inhibitor was held until after hemodialysis on those days to decrease the risk of hypotension during these sessions.
Acute monoarthritis felt not c/w gouty flare.
## Atrial fibrillation:  Remained in sinus rhythm, not anticoagulated given low CHADS Score (2), history of HIT and not anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation on admission.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 81219**] [**Hospital 4094**] Hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: Septic Arthritis Angioedema ESRD Sarcoid Breast Cancer Diabetes Thrombocytopenia   Discharge Condition: Good, weight bearing as tolerated   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of left knee pain.
It was found that you had an infection in your knee.
You also had an evaluation of your AV fistula that showed a narrowing.
Finally, there was some concern you may have had an allergic reaction after going to the Operating Room.
Please call your doctor or return to the Emergency Department if you have any fevers, increasing knee pain, or any other complaint concerning to you.
