Admission Date:  [**2166-10-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-10-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2092-2-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: ciprofloxacin / latex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 473**] Chief Complaint: Adenocarcinoma of the head of pancreas  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Whipple procedure with SMV reconstruction  History of Present Illness: Born in [**2091**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a strong and healthy gentleman who suffered a recent episode of acute pancreatitis in [**Month (only) **] of this summer of [**2166**].
He was identified as having a pancreatic head mass on CT imaging amidst the pancreatitis.
He is moving his bowels, making good urine, and has no diarrhea.
He has never developed obstructive jaundice.
He has no real prior surgical history.
There was a question of coronary artery disease, but he did well according to his result with the stress test three to four years ago.
I asked him to determine from you if he has had any sort of carotid imaging in light of the dizziness feeling and question of a vision loss that occurred three to four months ago.
He had prostate cancer for which he received external beam radiation therapy and he has known Barrett's esophagus.
This clearly sees the pancreatic head lesion, which does not involve any of the vasculature.
Quite surprisingly, in my judgment, the cytology report is negative for malignancy.
He has no other symptoms of chest pains or palpitations; no pneumonia, shortness of breath, and he has not got diabetes.
Other than the recent weight loss around this acute illness, he has been well.
There is no family history of pancreatic cancer.

Family History: No first degree relatives with cancer.
His neck is supple with midline trachea and no jugular venous distention.
His abdomen is entirely benign today with no masses or tenderness.
His extremities show no peripheral edema and full range of motion with a normal gait and grossly normal neurologic and vascular exams.

On [**2166-10-9**], the patient underwent pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy with en bloc resection of superior mesenteric vein, superior mesenteric vein primary venorrhaphy (end-to-end), and CyberKnife fiducial placements, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
Of note, a Left subclavian line was placed with a post-placement CXR that showed a Large left sided Pneumothorax.
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient was transfered to the ICU for increased monitoring given his vascular repair.
After being stabilized in the unit for a couple days, the patient arrived on the floor NPO on IV fluids, with a foley catheter and a JP drain in place, and an epidural for pain control.
Post-operative pain was initially well controlled with an epidural, which was converted to oral pain medication when tolerating clear liquids.
The patient subsequently voided without problem.
At the time of discharge on [**2166-10-17**], the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
