They noted his eyes were forward and there was no particular deviation to any side.
There he had a head CT which showed a possible mass in the right frontal lobe with surrounding edema.

There were no paraphasic errors.
was able to name both high and low frequency objects.
There was no evidence of apraxia or neglect.

Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS:  [**2169-8-24**] 10:15PM   PT-11.7 PTT-21.6* INR(PT)-1.0 [**2169-8-24**] 10:15PM   WBC-7.1 RBC-4.25* HGB-14.4 HCT-42.8 MCV-101* MCH-33.8* MCHC-33.6 RDW-14.4 [**2169-8-24**] 10:15PM   GLUCOSE-107* UREA N-30* CREAT-1.7* SODIUM-133 POTASSIUM-7.6* CHLORIDE-95* TOTAL CO2-25 ANION GAP-21* [**2169-8-25**] 12:10AM   K+-4.3  DISCHARGE LABS:  CT Head [**8-25**]: IMPRESSION: 1.6 cm mass centered in the right frontal lobe with associated vasogenic edema.
Metastasis highly suspect, possibly from adenocarcinoma.
No significant associated midline shift.
Large heterogeneous right paratracheal lymph node described above.
Recommend PSA as well as clinical exam to further evaluate for potential prostate carcinoma.
Small spiculated focus at the right lung apex.
This might represent scarring, but neoplasia cannot be excluded; recommend 3 month chest CT followup.
MRI Brain [**2169-8-27**] WAND study again demonstrates a right frontal lobe irregular rim-enhancing lesion as described previousl.
Status post right frontal mass resection with trace hyperdense material in the post-surgical bed may be surgical packing material or trace blood.
Vasogenic edema surrounding the resection bed.
Status post resection of a right frontal lobe lesion with expected sequelae.
No evidence of nodular enhancement at the resection margin to suggest residual disease.
No new enhancing lesion seen with stable cortical areas of slow diffusion in the left frontal, parietal and temporal lobes.
These remain concerning for acute/subacute infarcts and less likely metastatic lesions that do not enhance.
Post operatively, patient was nonfocal with a head CT that showed some small amount of hemorrhage in the resection cavity, but was otherwise stable.
The MRI was performed and reviewed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who found it to have satisfactory post-op changes.
On [**8-30**] he had an episode of speech arrest and visual disturbance thought to be a seizure and his Keppra was increased to 1000mg [**Hospital1 **].
