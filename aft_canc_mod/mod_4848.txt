Admission Date:  [**2126-2-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2126-2-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2043-10-16**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Codeine / Augmentin  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**] Chief Complaint: headache, neck pain, vomiting  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: HPI: The pt is a 82 year-old RH woman w/ Afib (on coumadin), HTN/CHF/HL/COPD who apparently had developed sudden onset R sided HA with pain behind the right eye with radiation to the neck and difficulties with vision.
Apparently had called EMS herself and was taken to [**Hospital **] hospital where on initial evaluation was noted to have BP of 175/89, exam notable for being alert, oriented, following commands and moving extremities symmetrically and to have a visual field cut.
She had subsequently developed hypotension reportedly to 60s systolic and required Dopamine temporarily.
Past Medical History: [ + ] HL [ - ] DM [ + ] Afib [ - ] prior CVA/TIA [ + ] HTN - CHF - COPD    Social History: Lives alone in [**Hospital3 **].
She does not use a cane or a walker to ambulate.
Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
Extremities: warm, dry, no edema  Pulses: 2+ radial.
IX, X: positive cough on demand.
L pronator drift.
-DTRs:     [**Name2 (NI) **]  Tri [**Last Name (un) 1035**] Pat Ach L   3   2    3     0   tr R   3   2    3     2   2  Plantar response: RIGHT - flexor LEFT - extensor  -Coordination: FNF intact w/ R index in R visual field, misses w/ L index in L visual field by ~3cm.
LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to extensive severe anterior and apical hypokinesis/akinesis, and hypokinesis of the septum and inferior free wall.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CT head [**2126-2-20**] IMPRESSION: Large right occipitoparietal lobar hemorrhage with surrounding edema and mass effect on the lateral ventricle, unchanged over the short- interval.
No shift of midline structures, or transtentorial or uncal herniation.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: Also demonstrated is a very small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage, localized in the immediately-overlying parietovertex sulci.
In the context of the acute lobar hemorrhage (as well as the patient's advanced age), this finding - which raises the possibility of associated pial vessel involvement - is strongly suggestive of underlying amyloid angiopathy.
Liver ultrasound [**2126-2-20**] Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Note, other more severe forms of liver disease such as cirrhosis or fibrosis cannot be excluded on this study.
No significant change in right occipital hemorrhage with persistent 2 mm shift towards the left.
Small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage is also stable.
No new hemorrhage is identified.
There is a saccular 4 mm aneurism at the bifurcation of L MCA, with vessels arrising.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 65763**] is an 82 year-old woman w/ Afib (on coumadin), HTN/CHF/HL/COPD who apparently had developed sudden onset R sided HA, n/v, including behind the right eye, neck discomfort.
Remainder of exam is notable for anisocoria of R < L by ~ 1mm, but reactive, impaired L VF (unable to assess visual fields formally), crossess midline to reach to the L arm to clap, R/L confusion, L pronator drift, LLE UMN weakness ~ 4 to 4-, upgoing L toe, ext.
Etiology of ICH is most likely amyloid given location and age, though an underlying mass can not be ruled out in this pt.
Despite HTN at OSH ED, unlikely to be HTNsive hemorrhage give location and character.
HOB was elevated at 30 degrees, SBP was maintained 120-160 and MAP < 110.
A non-contrast MRI brain was performed and post-contrast imaging showed a small calcified meningioma, and an unchanged parieto-occiptial infarct.
She was also found to have a 4mm aneurysm at the bifurcation of the left MCA.
Exam on discharge was notable for a left field cut, with upper quadrant sparing and a left pronator drift.
Her EKG showed T wave inversions in the inferior and lateral leads.
Echocardiogram showed a depressed EF as well as anterior and inferior hypokinesis.
It was thought her troponin leak may have been due to demand ischemia.
Abd/GI; The patient has a mild transaminitis of unclear etiology.
A liver ultrasound showed fatty infiltration.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 5682**] Nursing Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Intraparenchymal hemorrhage Secondary: HTN COPD CHF Atrial fibrillation  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane)  Left sided field cut.
Left pronator drift.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted following acute onset of headache and confusion.
You were found to have a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
