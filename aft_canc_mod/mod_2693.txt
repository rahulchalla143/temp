Initially admitted [**2143-11-4**] for a sense of movement in her vision, + nausea, gait instability due to vision problems.
[**Name (NI) **] to have upbeat nystagmus in all directions.
Dx'd with dizziness with oscillopsia, which can be seen in posterior circulation ischemia, wernickes, paraneoplastic syndromes, sarcoid or atypically in peripheral vestibulopathy.
MRI with gad on [**2143-11-6**] showed no acute stroke, but did have chronic small vessel ischemic disease and right A-1 hypoplasia.
LP showed lymphocytic meningitis.
By dinner that evening, she was having difficulty swallowing, and family brought her back to [**Hospital3 10959**] ED.
Seen again by neurology on [**2143-11-16**] for neck weakness and difficulty swallowing, no choking.
Exam still with nystagmus, found to have neck extensor weakness 3/5, wide based gait, subtle ataxia.
Medicine team also noted decreased reflexes and difficulty with sharp/dull discrimination in the legs.
Workup for carcinoma included torso CT showing an ovarian cyst (not further explored surgically), and bronchoscopy.
Bronch revealed atypical squamous cells per d/c summary but no overt mass.
Prior to the anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] antibodies turning positive, she was empirically treated for tuberculosis meningitis with rifampin, ethambutol, INH, PZA and pyridoxime as her father had TB when she was a child.
PPD negative.
By [**11-20**] her weakness had progressed to involve respiratory muscles, and she was on BiPAP for intermittent hypercarbia.
By [**11-23**] she was in respiratory failure with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status and required intubation and mechanical ventilation.
At that time she had no documented arm or leg weakness.
Found to have labile BP.
Family notes the start of bilateral hand action tremor in [**2143-11-25**], which has improved.
While at [**Hospital1 **] in [**11/2143**], developed left leg swelling and DVT found.
On [**2144-1-4**] while at [**Hospital1 **] family reports she had respiratory failure/arrest, though no cardiac arrest.
Thought secondary to mucous plug.
Was transferred to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital for a short time.
Profound neck muscle weakness has continued, and she remains difficult to wean.
ROS: Recent PNA/bronchitis with increased cough, secretions, fever.
Has improved, with decreased suctioning needed.
Otherwise, no fever, chills, chest pain, difficulty breathing on vent, abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation.

CT torso: Apical lung scarring.
Atherosclerotic disease of abdominal aorta with possible mural thrombus, renal and celiac artery stenosis at origins, prominent uterus and ovarian cyst  Labs from [**Hospital1 **]: [**2144-2-14**]: C dif negative.
Ca 8.5  WBC 9.4  Hct 34.8 Plt 259 CXR [**2144-2-5**]: LLL infiltrate, possible effusion, and R base atelectasis vs early infiltrate   Brief Hospital Course: 76 yo woman transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital **] rehab for workup of inability to wean from ventilator.
She developed bulbar, neck and respiratory muscle weakness at the end of [**2143**], and now also has arm/leg weakness of unclear etiology.
Initial workup at [**Hospital3 **] revealed anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] antibodies, but no cancer found.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 557**] suggested further workup:  a. MRI brain and spine to r/o central process-> MRI of the brain and cervical cord was obtained with gad and results were unrevealing.
No masses or lesions to explain her symptoms.
Only perivascular white matter changes.
b. LP for cytology done on [**2144-2-27**] -> negative for malignant cells  c. Muscle bx of right deltoid:  coumadin was stopped and heparin started when INR<2.0 in preparation for procedures.
A CT torso showed a 1.4 cm subcarinal node -> interventional pulm did a transbronchial bx on [**2144-2-24**], unfortunately the results were nondiagnostic.
CT surgery consulted and recommended VATS, thus she underwent this surgery on [**2144-2-26**] and was found to have a Neuroendocrine tumor of unknown etiology.
Final pathology showed a poorly differentiated carcinoma with neuroendocrine features.
She tolerated the chemo well and had minimal side effects.
Gyn: CT torso also showed 2cm adenexal cyst.
Gynecology was consulted, however patient adamantly refused vaginal ultrasound and gynecologic exam.
Noted to have some vaginal bleeding which will need to be worked up as an outpatient, if patient desires.
Patient underwent a bronchoscopy as her trach needed changing (per admission CXR), and no bronchial masses were seen.
BAL cytology was negative for malignancy.
The CT torso also revealed a LLL infiltrate, likely her resolving pneumonia diagnosed at [**Hospital1 **] s/p antibiotics course.
She remained afebrile with normal white count and thus levoflox was discontinued.
It was initially elevated but repeat was normal.
Free T4 normal, T3 slightly low, tyroid antibody anti TPO was mildly positive at 89, possibly due to sick euthyroid, or x-reaction with anti-[**Doctor Last Name **]??
Iron deficiency anemia: stools guaiac negative.
She has a questionable history of bilateral renal artery stenosis.
She had some elevated BP's into the 190's so her lisinopril was titrated up.
However msut closely monitor her BP has she gets extremely orthostaitsc with massive swings in her BP when going from supine to uprighgt position.
This is felt ot be secondary to autonomic dysfunction due to the paraneoplastic syndrome.
Must closely watch patient during PT and transitions in position for hypotensive events.
DVT in [**2143-11-25**]: admission INR was subtheraputic, but then became theraputic with several higher doses of coumadin.
She was unable to tolerate this valve as she became tachypnic, very uncomfortable.
FEN: Tube Feeds, vitamins, H2Blocker PPx: coumadin/heparin gtt, H2B, pneumoboots, proper wound care for pressure ulcers (right heel and coccyx), PT/OT FULL CODE Dispo: back to rehab after patient completes chemotherapy and post-chemo symptoms have been monitored for several days.
Simethicone 80 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: 0.5-1 Tablet, Chewable PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for bloating/gas.
Lactulose 10 g/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Paraneoplastic syndrome Lung Cancer HTN Respiratory Failure Neuromuscular Disorder DVT Hyperlipidemia Depression Iron Deficiency Anemia   Discharge Condition: Pt is stable on ventilatory support with trach in place.
She is afebrile, with no signs of active infection.
