Admission Date:  [**2157-8-22**]     Discharge Date:  [**2157-9-1**]  Date of Birth:   [**2103-9-28**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53 year old woman with metastatic renal cell cancer status post radical nephrectomy, high dose chemotherapy and biliary obstruction, who presents with nausea and poor p.o.
The patient had a neck mass resection in [**3-29**] which was harvested for dendritic cell vaccine.
She had disease progression in [**2157-6-29**] with biliary obstruction status post failed ERCP with subsequent PTC internalization of the stent.
The patient was admitted for hydration and further management of biliary obstruction.
Biliary obstruction status post failed ERCP, PTC with internalization of stent.
Supraclavicular lymphadenopathy on the right, no JVD.
Cardiovascular S1, S2, normal, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen a bit gastric and right upper quadrant tenderness.
Extremities had no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
On neuro exam cranial nerves II-XII were intact, no sensory deficits.
The patient underwent tube injection that showed no biliary ductal dilatation, distal flow, but slow flow likely secondary to extrinsic duodenal compression from tumor.
The patient was transferred to the MICU because during an interventional radiology procedure the patient developed stridor, shortness of breath.
The patient did have increased abdominal distension and fluid.
She had paracentesis on the 28th where 650 cc were drained.
The patient was treated for SBP.
She did grow out Pseudomonas and alpha and beta strep from her intestinal fluid.
She was also on Aldactone for ascites, but it was held secondary to hypotension.
The patient continued to have increased ascites and secondary to the patient's hypotension, paracentesis was not able to be performed.
The patient was medicated via her PCA to keep her discomfort at a minimum and to improve her shortness of breath.
Eventually her intestinal fluid grew out Pseudomonas and alpha and beta hemolytic strep.
However, the patient was hypotensive and it was a precarious balance between volume overload and hypotension.
On the 4th the patient was found to have stopped breathing.
