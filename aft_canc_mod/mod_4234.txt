Patient presented to ER on [**2168-7-15**] with progressive weakness of both arms and legs for the last 2-3 weeks.
He reports that his weakness (b/l arms and legs, R>L) has been ongoing over the past few months worsening over the past few weeks, mainly over the past 5 days.
He walks with a cane at baseline, but has noted that walking up stairs with his left leg leading has become increasingly more difficult due to his weakness.
He denies symptoms of bowel/bladder incontinence.
On arrival to ED was found to be tachycardic and hypotensive to systolic near 70s.
Additionally in the ED, CTA was performed which did not show evidence of PE (h/o DVT on coumadin; INR therapeutic) but with new LUL infiltrate.
He was seen by Neuro in the ED; weakness thought secondary to patient's underlying disease vs. use of velcade.
He was started on levofloxacin for possible PNA given LUL consolidation on imaging although not c/o symptoms of pneumonia.
ROS: Pt denies fever or chills.
No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain.
No headache, rhinorrhea or cough,or congestion.
Denied cough, shortness of breath (except transiently in the setting of SVT).
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No melena or BRBPR.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.
Past Medical History: NHL (see below) complicated by lymphomatous meningitis RLE weakness secondary to plexopathy Bilateral upper extremity weakness RLE DVT Hives intermittently over last couple years Raynaud's phenomena LUL lesion in [**2129**] s/p INH x1yr S/p appendectomy .
Biopsy revealed diffuse large cell lymphoma.
Patient was well until [**Month (only) **]-[**2167-11-1**] when he developed right lower extremity paralysis.
LP at that time was negative for malignant cells but repeat LP on [**2168-2-17**] revealed malignant cells with MRI showing increased uptake in the sacral plexus.
The patient was evaluated by neurology and thought to have a right lumbosacral plexopathy.
Around mid [**2168-2-1**] the patient began radiation therapy x9-12 treatments to the sacrum with improvement in pain complaints.
He has regained some use of his right lower extremity.
His father died at 75 of heart failure.
His sister is 65 and has diabetes and hypertension.
MMM, OP without lesions Neck: supple, no JVD or carotid bruits appreciated Pulm: fine crackles left lung base, no rhonchi nor wheezes Cardiac: RRR, nl S1/S2, no M/R/G appreciated Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, + BS, no masses or hepatomegaly noted.
Neurologic:  CN 2-12 intact, LUE with 4/5 biceps and triceps strength, 2-3/5 right biceps strength, Right hip flexor [**2-5**], [**6-4**] left hip flexor, [**5-5**] right plantar flexion, [**3-7**] right dorsiflexion, sensation to soft touch decreased slightly anterior right lower extremity to distal shin.
There is persistent ill-defined airspace disease involving left upper lobe likely related to pneumonia.
There is increasing density at the right base with blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
Findings are suggestive of right basilar atelectasis and small right pleural effusion.
[**2168-7-15**] MRI spine:  Compared to the previous study of [**2168-4-2**], there are now new focal signal abnormalities identified from L1 to L5 level.
The previously noted subtle lesions in some of these vertebral bodies have increased in size.
Findings are indicative of lymphoma deposits or metastatic disease.
There is increased signal seen on T1- and T2-weighted images in the remaining portions of the lumbar vertebral bodies and sacrum indicative of fatty marrow changes from radiation.
Focal signal abnormality in the upper sacrum is also identified on the right side, indicative of metastasis or bony involvement by lymphoma.
There is no epidural mass seen or thecal sac compression identified.
IMPRESSION:  New bony metastatic lesions involving the lumbar vertebral body with increase in size of previously noted lesion.
No evidence of pathologic fracture or intraspinal mass.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Patchy ground-glass opacity within the left upper lobe, which is new since [**2168-4-1**] and likely represent an infectious process.
Stable 12 mm prevascular lymph node within the mediastinum.
Multiple low density lesions within the liver, which given history of lymphoma may represent metastates, or given pulmonary findings could represent infection.
[**2168-7-21**]:MRI spine, interval increase in size and # of enhancing metastatic foci in LS spine, no involvment of exiting nerve roots or thecal sac.
[**2168-7-21**] MRI brachial plexus: Normal examination of the right and left brachial plexus, without abnormal enhancement.
Mild degenerative changes of the cervical spine and focus of signal abnormality in the T6 vertebral body.
Parenchymal abnormalities of the left lung apex.

1.Weakness: Patient was evaulated by neurology and it was thought that patients weakness was either due to CNS lymphatous involvement vs. velade.
MRI perforemd showed new focal signal abnormalities from L1-L5 and sacral bony involvement looks worse.
However, there was no epidural or thecal compression/involvement found.
Patient has been working with physical therapy.
He will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] on tuesday at 10:00 for examination followed by admission of his next methotrexate treatment.
A chest x-rday on [**7-23**] showed proessive left apical consolidation.
Neuropathy thought secondary to velcade, now stopped.
RLE swelling: Patient has history of RLE DVT diagnosed in [**3-/2168**] for which he has been on coumadin.
8.increased LFT's thought to be due to either methotrexate or bactrim.
