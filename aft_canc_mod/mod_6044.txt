Admission Date:  [**2156-4-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**2156-4-11**]  Date of Birth:   [**2097-12-19**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58 year old male with a history of stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer treated with multiple modalities who presents with one week history of shortness of breath.
Approximately five weeks ago, the patient noted the onset of hoarseness which has progressed since the onset.
ENT evaluation revealed recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis as the etiology and recommendations for CT scan of chest and neck were made.
Imaging was notable for recurrence of a mass in the right upper lobe abutting the mediastinum as well as multiple left sided hilar lymph nodes.
Right upper lobe mass was noted to be large in size and to compress the superior vena cava.
Findings from the magnetic resonance scan and bone scan revealed no metastases.
Echocardiogram was significant for a circumferential pericardial effusion, right ventricular diastolic collapse and thickening of the visceral pericardium.
The patient was taken to the catheterization laboratory and pericardiocentesis was performed with subsequent placement of a pericardial drain.
History of back melanoma, status post resection.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Diabetes mellitus in father and cancer in mother who had melanoma.
The neck is soft, supple, no jugular venous distention.
The heart is regular rate and rhythm, positive S1 and S2, II/VI systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border accentuated with expiration, III/VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border accentuated with inspiration, positive S4.
Right groin catheter removed, no bruit or hematoma noted.
Extremities no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, warm, dorsalis pedis pulses 2+ bilaterally.
Pericardial fluid with a total protein of 6.2, LDH 3960, albumin 3.6, glucose 34, amylase 33 and culture and cytology were pending.
Electrocardiogram #1 showed normal sinus rhythm in the 80s, first degree AV block, normal axis, PR depression diffusely with ST elevations diffusely.
No Q waves and no T wave inversions.
Electrocardiogram #2 post pericardiocentesis showed sinus tachycardia, rate 100s, first degree AV block, normal axis, and new right bundle branch block, T wave inversions in V1 through V2 and ST depressions in V1 through V3.
Echocardiogram prior to pericardiocentesis showed left ventricular ejection fraction within normal limits, sustained right atrial collapse consistent with low filling pressures, left atrial collapse consistent with significant elevation of intrapericardial pressures, right ventricular diastolic collapse, thickening of the visceral pericardium.
IMPRESSION:  A 58 year old male, with history of stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2154**], metastatic to brain, status post multiple modality treatment, presents with five week history of hoarseness and subsequent detection of a right upper lobe mass with lymph node involvement.
The patient studied for radiation therapy mapping and noted to have large pericardial fluid collection in the setting of recent shortness of breath requiring pericardiocentesis and subsequent drain placement.
There was trivial physiologic pericardial effusion.
There were no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
The patient at this time continued to have moderate output of fluid and decision was made to continue drain placement until the following day at which point if fluid output had decreased, the drain would be pulled.
On hospital day number three, minimal drainage was noted and the drain was removed and the patient was transferred to the medical [**Hospital1 **].
With removal of fluid, the patient noted improvement in his shortness of breath and had no further episodes of difficulty breathing while an inpatient at [**Hospital1 188**].
In addition, lastly the patient was initially well hydrated with intravenous fluids to maintain preload in light of his tamponade physiology.
Cytology of the pericardial fluid was analyzed and was subsequently noted to be positive for malignant cells consistent with metastatic carcinoma.
Ischemia - The patient with no known coronary artery disease nor an signs or symptoms of ischemic heart disease during the hospital stay.
Pump - As above, the patient with an ejection fraction of greater than 55% and was not noted to have any congestive heart failure signs or symptoms requiring diuresis.
Rhythm - The patient with new onset right bundle branch block after intervention.
It was the feeling of the primary CCU team that this was secondary to irritation of the right ventricle during right heart catheterization.
Oncology - As above, the patient with a history of nonsmall cell lung cancer and was being mapped for radiation therapy secondary to recurrence and now with a malignant pericardial effusion.
In speaking with the patient's outpatient oncologist, the patient to receive chemotherapy and radiation therapy as treatment for his recurrence in the setting of mild superior vena cava compression.
Hypertension - The patient's Lopressor dose was initially held on admission to the CCU, however, with slightly elevated blood pressure off his medication, Lopressor was restarted and at the time of discharge, the patient was at his usual outpatient dose of 50 mg Lopressor p.o.
There were no active issues.
Hematology - The patient's hematocrit dropped slightly from a value on [**2156-3-25**], however, remained stable during the hospital stay requiring no transfusions.
Pericardial tamponade, status post pericardiocentesis.
Follow-up appointment at the echocardiographic laboratory on [**2156-4-14**], for repeat echocardiogram to evaluate for fluid reaccumulation.
