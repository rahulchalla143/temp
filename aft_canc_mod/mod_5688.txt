female with severe COPD x 25+ years, supplemental oxygen for over a year, DMII, vascular dementia, presenting from home with respiratory distress.
Patient was brought in by EMS after family called due to increased work of breathing.
Approximately 4 days prior to presentataion, family noted she was having productive cough with greenish / brown streaked sputum.
They deny any fevers, chills or diaphoresis.
On date of admission, patient reportedly went to the restroom where she called for help due to "crushing chest pain" and difficulty breathing.
During my evaluation, she denied this chest pain prior to presentation.
Patient noted to have significant respiratory distress, placed on NRB with O2 sat in 100's, however initial blood gas 7.19/98/90.
HR 100, BP 103/53 on nitro initially given for severe hypertension (200' systolic); however off at time of transfer.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No fevers, chills, weight loss, diaphoresis, headache, visual changes, sore throat, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, melena, pruritis, easy bruising, dysuria, skin changes, pruritis.
Past Medical History: COPD on 2L home O2 DM2 Dementia HTN Dyslipidemia Goiter s/p RAI R breast nodule RUL opacity on CT--thought to be scarring from pneumonia, but ddx includes cancer  Social History: She continued to smoke one to two packs of cigarettes/day until [**Month (only) 404**] of this years.
There is no history of known dementia in the family.
Physical Exam: VS: 97.5, 136/79, 102, 28-30, 98% 2L NC, BG 274 GEN: The patient is in some distress with breathing, somewhat short of breath with long sentences SKIN: No rashes or skin changes noted HEENT: JVP = 5-7 cm, neck supple, No lymphadenopathy in cervical, posterior, or supraclavicular chains noted.
CHEST: Lungs with markedly decreased BS and expiratory wheezing  CARDIAC: Tachycardic, regular rhythm, faint grade I-II systolic murmur at LLSB.
ABDOMEN: Non-distended, and soft without tenderness EXTREMITIES: no peripheral edema, warm without cyanosis NEUROLOGIC: Alert and appropriate.
No pronator drift.
The aorta is tortuous with calcifications present.
There are mild increased interstitial markings bilaterally, suggestive of mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
Blunting of the costophrenic sulci bilaterally suggest the presence of small bilateral pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax is visualized.
No acute skeletal abnormalities are visualized.
IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.
Large lung volumes consistent with COPD.
Mild bilateral apical thickening.
Normal size of the cardiac silhouette, mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
No focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
Pleural effusions.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild coronary and aortic calcifications are present.
Scattered mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes do not meet CT criteria for lymphadenopathy.
A multinodular goiter is present, with hypoechoic lesions measuring up to 16 mm.
There is no cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy.
No pulmonary embolism is seen, although the study is slightly limited due to respiratory motion-related artifact.
There is diffuse centrilobular emphysema, unchanged since the prior CT exam from 1/[**2178**].
Within the right upper lobe, there is a 14 x 11 mm enhancing nodule with surrounding ground-glass opacity (3:21).
Previous CT examinations since [**2176**] have shown a confluent reticular and ground-glass opacity in this area, compatible with a focal area of scarring.
However, the current study demonstrates a new solid central region, so an underlying solid mass can no longer be excluded.
Within the left upper lobe, there is a vaguely defined linear region of ground-glass opacity (3:22), unchanged since prior [**2176**], and compatible with mild scarring.
No other nodules or masses are appreciated.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Included views of the upper abdomen demonstrate multiple gallstones within a normal-appearing gallbladder.
Mild degenerative changes are present throughout the thoracic spine.
Old left fifth and sixth rib fractures are unchanged.
There is no acute fracture or dislocation.
No sclerotic or lytic lesions are detected.
No pulmonary embolism detected.
Previously seen right upper lobe density now demonstrates a central solid component.
Persistent vaguely-defined linear area of ground-glass opacity within the left upper lobe is unchanged and compatible with mild scarring.
In both lower Extremities, the common femoral, proximal greater saphenous, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins are normal with appropriate compressibility, wall-to-wall flow and color analysis and response to augmentation.
IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 97068**] is a 77 year old woman with COPD on home O2, pulmonary hypertension, htn, hyperlipidemia, presenting with acute COPD exacerbation with unclear trigger, now improved on BIPAP/steroids/nebs, and noted to have spiculated lung mass concerning for malignancy.
# ACUTE COPD EXACERBATION: At time of admission, patient with significant respiratory distress.
Patient does have with very depressed FEV1 (33% predicted in 2/[**2178**]).
No clear preceeding prodrome, no fevers or chills, however does note sputum color change.
Given degree of acidosis with metabolic compensation, suspect this has been a slowly progressing decompensation.
She received IV solumedrol 125mg and was transitioned to oral prednisone 60mg PO with a slow taper.
Her respiratory virus panel was negative, lower extremity ultrasound negative and CT negative for PE, although with incidental finding of interval change in lung mass (see below).
Pulmonary was consulted given slow improvement, and felt that she would benefit from slow steroid taper along with chronic low dose PO steroids.
# RESPIRATORY ACIDOSIS: At admission very significant acidosis (pH 7.19/ pCO2 98 /pO2 90) which normalized to her baseline after BiPAP and above treatment.
Suspect large degree of chronic respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation, as noted by chronically elevated bicarbonate.
# LUNG MASS: Previously noted on CTA Chest from [**2178-1-26**], however this admission's CTA demonstrated a 14 x 11 mm right upper lobe density with central solid component.
# SINUS TACHYCARDIA: resolved.
DDx included hypovolemia vs. nebulizer treatment vs. anxiety/COPD flare vs. infection.
No localizing sx of infection and cultures were negative.
Improved with treatment of COPD and slight volume resuscitation.
# URINARY TRACT INFECTION: in setting of dysuria and enterococcus urine culture, patient started on amoxicillin 500 mg [**Hospital1 **].
# HYPERLIPIDEMIA: continued pravastatin .
# DEPRESSION: continued Sertraline and Trazodone per outpatient regimen .
Ventolin HFA 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) puffs Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
