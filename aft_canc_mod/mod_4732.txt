[**2185-11-4**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 126.
No other diagnostic abnormality.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
[**2185-11-3**] EUS: Large amount of yellow liquid with large solid particles were noted in the stomach, it could not be completely suctioned out due to the large particles occluding suction channel An irregular, circumferential, friable mass was found in the antrum causing obstruction of the gastric outlet Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology after EUS examination and FNA.
EUS was performed using a radial echoendoscope at 7.5 MHz frequency, however, a full examination was not able to be performed due to the presence of large amount of fluid in the stomach: There was marked thickening of the stomach wall in the antrum, demarcation between mucosa, submucosa and muscularis propria was lost.
Celiac axis was examined and no lympadenopathy was noted.
[**2185-11-4**] EUS Biopsy: Gastric mucosa, antrum: Antral mucosa with focal intestinal metaplasia.
[**2185-11-3**] Antrum wall cytology report: SUSPICIOUS FOR ADENOCARCINOMA.
Scantly cellular specimen with scattered highly atypical  	 glandular epithelial cells with high N:C ratio, prominent  	 nucleoli, and vacuoles; one signet-ring appearing cell seen.
[**2185-11-19**] CXR: Left lower lobe opacity is a combination of pleural effusion and probably atelectasis.
Small right pleural effusion is probably unchanged.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Multiple thoracic vertebral body compression fractures are noted.
There is no sign of acute or chronic pulmonary embolism or pulmonary hypertension.
There is no mediastinal, hilar or axillary adenopathy.
Aorta demonstrates mild atherosclerotic burden without aneurysm with conventional branching of arch vessels.
There is a left pleural effusion.
There is consolidation in the left lower lobe adjacent to the pleural effusion which may be due to compressive atelectasis versus pneumonia.
There is a smaller right pleural effusion.
No nodule or mass.
There are compression fractures in the T8 and T9 vertebra with approximately 50% height loss without breach of posterior cortex or retropulsion, stable from [**2185-11-4**].
There are also significant degenerative changes involving the right shoulder joint.
IMPRESSION: No acute or chronic pulmonary embolism.
Left pleural effusion with adjacent consolidation, atelectasis versus pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 82 yo F transferred for workup of a stomach mass, which presented with nausea and vomiting.
# Gastric mass: presented with mass from OSH.
Partially obstructing, concerning for malignancy.
EUS performed on [**11-4**] confirmed mass, with concern for linitis plastica vs. lymphoma.
Biopsies returned positive for intestinal metaplasia without any signs of overt malignancy.
NGT was eventually needed for the pt as she began vomiting gastric secretions on [**2185-11-6**].
The patient was evaluated by surgery and deemed intermediate to high risk candidate based on her cardiovascular risk factors and history of an MI in the past.
presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Her ASA was initially held but restarted on [**2185-11-7**] at 81 mg daily due to her risk of restenosis of her prior cardiovascular stents.
The patient remained asymptomatic throughout the event.
She remained in atrial fibrillation with a persistently elevated ventricular rate ranging between the 80's-120's.
This was negative for evidence of a blood clot although the final read of this study is pending at your time of discharge.
Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] no further transfusions were needed.
# DM: Blood glucose levels were intermittenly elevated with a regular insulin sliding scale and glyburide early in the admission.
At the time of transfer to medicine she has occasional low blood sugars and her glyburide was reduced to 2.5mg daily.
# Coronary artery disease s/p MI, 3 stents:  She was initially off ASA for procedures but placed back on low dose ASA on [**2185-11-7**].
# Pain: Her standing APAP and methadone were converted to intravenous morphine and then a Dilaudid PCA while NPO.
The patient resumed oral methadone and was transitioned to oral Percocet once tolerating po with well-controlled abdominal pain.
She continued to have right shoulder and back pain throughout the course of her hospital stay.
She also developed severe constipation during her hospitalization and was discharged on an aggressive bowel regimen of senna, colace, and miralax.
