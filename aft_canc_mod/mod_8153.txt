The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
Opacities at the lung bases, right greater than left, concerning for aspiration pneumonia as seen on the recent chest x-ray.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Persistent mild gaseous distention of the colon which tapers to normal caliber at the sigmoid colon.
Mild central intrahepatic biliary dilation and inflammatory changes surrounding the common bile duct, unchanged since [**2192-10-5**].
Again, this is likely related to sequela of chronic cholangitis with no evidence of an active process.
RUQ U/S : This is a very limited study due to overlying gas, showing mild central common hepatic duct dilatation.
This could be further evaluated with MRCP or ERCP if clinically appropriate.
The stent appeared occluded without noticeable drainage - this was successfully removed.
Three stones and debris ranging in size from 5 mm to 10 mm that were causing partial obstruction were seen at the common bile duct.
Given recent MI and low platelets, decision was made not to proceed with sphincterotomy.

Patient remained afebrile on Unasyn, and was transitioned to Augmentin on [**2193-7-6**].
# NSTEMI: Pt reported a brief episode of chest pain on admission accompanied by non-specific ST depressions that resolved w/o intervention, followed by troponins peaking at 1.17 before trending downward.
