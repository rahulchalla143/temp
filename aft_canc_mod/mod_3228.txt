Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy ([**2118-7-12**])  History of Present Illness: 54 year-old male with an enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma diagnosed in [**2115**], with known gastric and jejunal ulcers and history of small bowel resection for microperforation, admitted for auto-BMT on [**2118-6-17**].
His course was complicated by a bout of hepatitis in [**2118-4-19**] which was felt to be chemical in etiology and led to weight loss, sprue exacerbation and relapse.
His bone marrow performed at the beginning of [**Month (only) **] revealed some minimal involvement with his T-cell lymphoma.
His liver biopsy performed on [**2118-4-28**] revealed numerous apoptotic hepatocytes, multiple small foci of sinusoidal mononuclear inflammation and enlarged Kupffer cells consistent with acute hepatitis.
No neoplastic cells.
Tissue EGD performed on [**2118-5-12**] showed some involvement by enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma in one biopsy section.
Further investigation led to biopsy of small bowel and the diagnosis of T cell lymphoma was made.
Liver bx revealed non-specific inflammation consistent with acute hepatitis.
His father died of an unknown cardiac event at the age 34.
Mother, sister and grandmother have diabetes mellitus.
No murmur, rub or gallop.
ABD: Soft and non-tender.
EXT: No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase on admission at 124, transaminases within normal limits (ALT-9, AST-15, TOT BILI-0.1).
His period of neutropenia extended from [**2118-6-27**] to [**2118-7-7**], at which time his ANC was back up to 2230.
He had evidence of only mild oropharyngeal mucositis which was treated with Peridex and Nystatin.
On [**2118-7-15**], Mr. [**Known lastname 45745**] had an acute transfusion reaction to platelets, with hypotension, diffuse dermal edema and periorbital edema, currently under investigation.
He received Solumedrol IV and Pepcid IV with symptomatic relief.
2) ID: Mr [**Known lastname 45745**] had an isolated temperature spike on [**2118-6-21**] (day -3), at which time he was started on Vancomycin and Levoquin (latter to be started as part of the protocol on [**2118-6-22**]).
He quickly defervesced, but developed a diffuse maculopapular rash on [**2118-6-23**], at which time Vanco was D/C'd as it was felt to be a possible culprit.
He became febrile again on [**2118-6-30**], at which time Vanco and Cefepime were started, and Levoquin was discontinued.
He remained persistently febrile and an antifungal was added, along with Flagyl for a history of diarrhea (eventually C. difficile negative).
Given worsening of the rash with periorbital edema and query contribution to the fever, along with possibility of drug fever, all antibiotics were stopped on [**2118-7-6**] and he received 1 dose of Solumedrol.
CT chest on [**2118-7-10**] revealed multiple small non-specific nodules, felt by pulmonary to be non-significant.
Daptomycin was added on [**2118-7-12**] given persistent fever and desire to broaden gram positive coverage (Vancomycin was felt to be a potential culprit in the rash).
An MRI of the liver done on [**2118-7-13**] was negative for hepatic candidiasis.
On [**7-18**] meropenem and flagyl were discontinued, with no further fever spikes.
He was seen by GI, who was reluctant to perform a scope given the patient's low platelets and leukopenia, although ANC > 500.
On [**2118-7-11**], his Hct dropped again from 29 to 21.8 with persistent melanotic stools and he was transferred to the ICU.
An EGD was performed on [**2118-7-12**], which revealed ulceration in D3 consistent with an area of ulcerative duodenitis without active bleeding.
Pill endoscopy was considered but cancelled given a prior history of small bowel stricture.
The bleeding was also not significant enought for a tagged RBC scan.
He developed a diffuse maculopapular rash on [**2118-6-23**], which changed to a diffuse blanching erythematous rash on [**2118-7-6**] and persisted.
He also developped some periorbital edema on [**2118-7-6**] and received a dose of Solumedrol.
Discharge Instructions: Return to the hospital to have your blood drawn tomorrow.
