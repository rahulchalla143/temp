Admission Date:  [**2198-9-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2198-9-20**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 633**] Chief Complaint: fatigue and decreased PO  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP  History of Present Illness: 87M with h/o stage IV pancreatic cancer with liver mets presents with 2 days of generalized weakness, malaise, and poor PO intake.
Reports one episode of shaking chills while watching television 3 days ago, did not take temperature and denies other chills or fever.
Has chronic intermittent nausea for which he takes meds at home, no recent emesis.
Recently when he has the urge to urinate or defecate, he produces only a small volume of dark yellow urine and/or non-bloody stool.
Normally on laxative and stool softener with daily stools, no melena or hematochezia.
Also denies chest pain and SOB.
Labs showed elevated LFTs with Tbili 7.7 up from baseline 0.9 and alk phos 474 up from 261.
RUQ US showed contracted gallbladder with thickened wall and sludge with possible stones.
Of note, ERCP in [**2198-4-17**] in the context of elevated LFTs/nausea showed duodenal bulb stenosis likely [**3-21**] tumor compression.
2cm stricture in lower CBD seen, sphincterotomy was performed with hepatobiliary stent placement.
Both LFTs and nausea improved.
Today he is admitted directly to the ICU for progressive weakness, decreased po intake, and hypotension with bilirubinemia and neutrophilic leukocytosis.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer Originally presented with a one month history of progressive vomiting (1-2 hrs after eating) and the inability to tolerate food, lost approximately 15-20 lbs in a month.
His labs were notable for a very high alk phos, and CT disclosed multiple lesions in the liver and pancreatic head fullness.
An EUS was performed which disclosed a 2cm mass in the head of the pancreas; FNA was performed and returned as adenocarcinoma.
On [**2198-4-26**] he had a biliary stent placed with improvement in his alk phos and nausea symptoms.
First dose 3/16; subsequently stopped due to side effects.
Other Past Medical History: Stage IV CKD Hx of nephrolithiasis Renal Osteodystrophy Papillary Urothelial Carcinoma s/p TURBT, receiving BCG treatments Hx of invasive SCC of the head s/p Mohs resection Chronic L pleural effusion (neg for malignant cells on last thoracentesis, [**2197-9-17**]) Moderate Aortic Stenosis (AV area 1 cm2) CAD (prior inferior MI evident on EKG) Hypertension Dyslipidemia Anemia (was on Aranesp) Glaucoma  Social History: -Used to work for Polaroid, also a retired WWII veteran -Lives alone in an [**Hospital3 **] facility that provides evening meals.

[**9-8**] CXR for ?PNA ONE VIEW OF THE CHEST: The lungs are well inflated in the upper zones with bilateral lower lobe opacities.
Bilateral pleural effusion are noted, moderate on left, small on right.
No pneumothorax is present.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral effusions and lower lobe opacities may reflect atelectasis and/or pneumonia.
[**9-8**] RUQ US RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The liver demonstrates a heterogeneous echotexture with multiple focal nodules, findings consistent with known metastatic pancreatic carcinoma.
There is a mild amount of perihepatic ascites and a small right pleural effusion.
Dirty shadowing within the gallbladder is likely secondary to air given the history of known biliary stent.
Air and fluid filled gallbladder with diffuse wall thickening, likely secondary to third spacing from hepatic dysfunction.
Multiple hepatic masses consistent with known metastatic pancreatic carcinoma.
Small amount of perihepatic ascites and a small right pleural effusion.
[**9-8**] CT ABD non-contrast CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are identified with associated compressive atelectasis.
No definite focal mass or nodule identified.
The heart size is normal, and there is no pericardial effusion.
Multiple hypoattenuating lesions are identified within the liver, findings consistent with known metastatic disease from pancreatic carcinoma.
A biliary stent remains in standard position within the distal common bile duct and appears grossly patent.
An ill-defined soft tissue mass in the head of the pancreas, appears similar compared to prior, though is incompletely evaluated on this non-contrast examination.
No pancreatic ductal dilatation is identified in the body or tail.
The local extent of the mass is not well-evaluated on this examination.
The gallbladder is air and fluid-filled, likely secondary to a combination of sludge and air from the stented biliary tree.
An exophytic lesion in the lower pole of the left kidney also appears unchanged and measures 2.2 x 2.3 cm, likely a simple cyst (2:42).
Bilateral perinephric stranding appears slightly increased compared to prior.
There is a large amount of ascites and a significant amount of mesenteric fat stranding, findings consistent with diffuse edema.
The abdominal aorta demonstrates mild ectasia, though no frank aneurysmal dilatation.
Scattered mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are identified, though are difficult to evaluate on this non-contrast examination.
BONE WINDOWS: No bone destructive lesion or acute fracture is identified.
Biliary stent in standard position in the distal common bile duct and grossly patent.
New moderate abdominal ascites and significant mesenteric stranding, findings consistent with severe edema.
Fluid and air within the gallbladder, likely secondary to ERCP.
Large soft tissue density mass in the pancreatic head, though incompletely characterized on this non-contrast examination.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in partial opacification.
Biliary Tree: Many small stones / sludge that were causing obstruction were seen at the lower third of the common bile duct and middle third of the common bile duct within the metal stent.
Partial opacification of the upper third of the duct and birfucation showed on evidence of obstruction proximal to the stent.
Procedures: Copious amouts of sludge / small stone fragments were extracted successfully using a balloon.
No obstruction proximal to the stent was noted.
Continue IV antibiotics and supportive care.
Watch for complications - bleeding , perforation, pancreatitis   Brief Hospital Course: 87 yo M w/known stage IV pancreatic cancer & liver metastases s/p recent biliary stent placement, CKD, HTN, & CAD p/w acute-onset fatigue, malaise, decreased POs with elevated WBC and t-bili suspicious for septic cholangitis.
However, on [**9-19**], pt became hypoxic and was very clear (AAOx3) that he did not want any further medications and wanted to focus solely on comfort care.
[**Name (NI) **] seasons hospice became involved and pt was then made full inpatient hospice care.
Pt presented with syndrome of malaise/fatigue/decreased POs, found to be jaundiced and hypotensive with elevated LFTs and elevated neutrophilic WBC.
RUQ ultrasound suggested acute obstructive cholangitis with cholelithiasis.
Obstruction of recently-placed metal CBD stent seen on CT provides a good explanation for elevated bilirubin and acute cholangitis.
Patient's hypotension on admission responded well to 5L IVF in the ED but he continued to require levophed at 0.1 mg/hr to maintain SBP >90 and MAP>60 during the first 24h the ICU.
IVF was given judiciously for low urine output/hypotension due pt history of moderate aortic stenosis/chronic pleural effusions.
He was initially continued on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and zosyn), which were narrowed to ceftriaxone once microbiology showed Cftx-sensitive Klebsiella.
Tbili was acutely increased to 7.7, pt with painless jaundice on exam.
CBD stent placed in [**2198-4-17**] was seen on CT abdomen to be obstructing biliary flow.
Source of possible obstruction include tumor ingrowth within the CBD stent, external compression from stricture proximal to the stent site, or stones/sludge.
Immediately following ERCP LFTs trended upward, tbili max 9.7, and decreased to 7, but then had proceeded to increase to 13.2 with elevated d bili above 11.
Given goals of care, decision was made to not proceed with further imaging or repeat ERCP.
No history of atrial fibrillation in [**Hospital 228**] medical record, therefore Afib likely started in context of sepsis.
Of note, pt takes 12.5 mg PO metoprolol tartrate [**Hospital1 **] at home for a history of CAD and he did not take any of his home medications on the day of admission.
Digoxin was started given need for rate control in this patient with pressor-dependent hypotension but then held given elevated dig level.
Lopressor stopped because of relative hypotension on floor (Bps 90s) and heart rates that remain <100.
#Malnutrition: cachexia secondary to cancer and hypoalbumenia.
Diagnosed 6 months ago, pt is s/p several weeks of chemotherapy which was discontinued as an outpatient given intolerance of side effects in the context of metastatic disease.
No intervention for now, as patient, family and PCP have agreed to proceed with comfort care.
Outpatient primary care physician/gastroenterologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 172**] followed the pt while in the ICU and assisted with patient/family communication.
No pain or swelling of his extremities noted on exam.
Pt denies dyspnea, chest pain, or neurologic symptoms.
Of note, patient not on anticoagulation despite DVT earlier this year because of upper GI bleeding while on heparin gtt and ASA.
[**Last Name (STitle) 172**] and considered dabigatran vs. aspirin vs. no anticoagulation.
#Worsening Chronic Constipation.
#Hx  and Hypertension: d/c'd lopressor and lasix given volume status and hypotension .
LIkely intra-vascular volume depletion with total volume overload.
#Hx bladder cancer, s/p TURB.
Based on the patient's multiple co-morbidities and poor prognosis, discussions were held with him and his family about goals of care.
