Admission Date:  [**2118-10-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-11-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2049-8-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / raw egg yolk / Bactrim / flu shot  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3963**] Chief Complaint: Abnormal labs  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line Lumbar puncture Thoracentesis  History of Present Illness: 69 year old female with a questionable history of sarcoidosis with massive LAD leading to lymphedema and a recent left-sided ureteral stenosis s/p stent ([**2118-8-24**]) presents from rehab with elevated creatinine, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia.
She is complaining of pain of her lower extremities and backside, but she has not had any fevers or chills.
She has had a history of presumed sarcoidosis since [**2112**], though no definitive diagnosis has ever been made because her biopsy results have been inconclusive.
She had been refractory to high-dose steroids and her subclavicular lymphadenopathy has left her with massive lymphedema.
Her course has been complicated by multiple hospitalization and rehab stays since [**2118-1-23**], punctuated by an episode of severe hypercalcemia and a 30-lb weight loss, along with electrolyte abnormalities.
Her muscle weakness has been attributed to steroid myopathy.
Prior work-up showed negative [**Doctor First Name **] and ANCA, ESR of 18, and an abnormal SPEP with a IgG lambda monoclonal population of about 3% of the total protein population.
Renal (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1366**]) was consulted around the time of her admission to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for a similar set of circumstance (though she was hypokalemic at that time) and outlined the following issues: (1) Creat 1.5 with low grade proteinuria (UP/Cr ~1.5), (2) Edema with hypoalbuminemia (mid 2s), (3) Hyponatremia of likely multifactorial etiologies, (4) Left ureteral obstruction with stent placed in [**Location (un) **] in [**Month (only) **], as above.
Exam was notable for AAOx3, but occasionally confused at times and yelling, severe LE edema bilaterally with ulcers on right lateral lower leg, left dorsal aspect of foot, and left calf.
EKG unremarkable with normal sinus rhythm and no peaked T waves, but received calcium gluconate and IV regular insulin for treatment of hyperkalemia.
She was given morphine for pain control.
Urinalysis showed pyuria and many bacteria, so she was started on Cipro as well.
Renal U/S showed moderate left hydronephrosis, new in comparison to prior study from [**2118-8-28**] with visualization of the renal stent (patient reports passing the stent).
She is being admitted to the ICU for severe hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and [**Last Name (un) **].

Limited study due to lack of IV contrast demonstrates mild left hydronephrosis and hydroureter with the point of transition likely in the proximal to mid left ureter but not clearly identified.
No stent or renal stones are identified.
Mesenteric lymphadenopathy as well as inguinal and iliac lymphadenopathy raises the question of lymphoproliferative disease.
Mild mesenteric haziness.
Bilateral small pleural effusions.
Moderate subcutaneous edema.
[**2118-10-7**] Renal U/S IMPRESSION:  Moderate left hydronephrosis with no ureteral stent seen.
Left soft tissue mass tracking around left subclavian vessels and going to left supraclavicular area is unchanged since [**2118-2-23**].
A left supraclavicular lymph node biopsy has been done in [**9-4**]; even if the pathologic report mentionned possible sarcoid, the radiologic appearance, however, is non-specific and malignant disease is also included in the differential diagnosis.
Bilateral non-hemorrhagic moderate pleural effusions are new since [**2118-2-23**] and are increased since recent abdominal CT of [**2118-10-7**].
Mixed evolution of the pulmonary nodules.
In lower lobes, the lung nodules cannot be compared because of compressive atelectasis and pleural effusions.
Bronchial wall thickening with atelectasis in lower lobe could be related to aspiration.
Right adrenal lesion is unchanged since [**2118-2-23**].
Moderate functional mitral stenosis.
Mild aortic stenosis.Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function.
Dilated ascending aorta.
No discrete vegetation or pathologic regurgitation identified.
Flow-Volume Loop: Moderately reduced flows and volume excursion with very mild expiratory coving and an early termination of exhalation.
Results are consistent with a restrictive ventilatory defect and moderate gas exchange defect.
5-mm left frontal enhancing lesion with slow diffusion.
Differential diagnosis includes neoplastic process (which is favored), or small infarction.
Recommend clinical correlations and short-term imaging follow up to assess for interval changes.
Extensive white matter disease.
Paranasal sinuses disease as described above.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, stone, or mass in either kidney.
Small right pleural effusion and small ascites are present.
IMPRESSION:  No hydronephrosis in either kidney.
Left supraclavicular mass appears similar in size and likely compresses the left subclavian vein, accounting for the left arm swelling.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions which are simple fluid in density.
Although chylothorax is possible due to thoracic duct obstruction from the supraclavicular mass, it is less likely because the fluid density would be expected to be lower given the high fat content of lymphatic fluid.
Stricture of the intrahepatic portion of the IVC as well as at a point just superior to the bifurcation may be due to sclerosis or post-treatment changes.
New splenic infarction.
Diffuse dilation of the large bowel consistent with ileus.
No significant active lymphadenopathy within the chest, abdomen or pelvis aside from the supraclavicular mass discussed previously.
Severe multilevel degenerative disc disease.
[**2118-11-8**] CXR IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**11-2**] and 12: Previous mild pulmonary edema has resolved, but small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis remain.
There is no pneumothorax.
[**2118-11-9**] LUE U/S No DVT in the left upper extremity.
Previously present bibasilar atelectasis has nearly completely resolved, and small pleural effusions have decreased in size with minimal remaining effusions.
This may reflect a subacute infarct, although the diffusion abnormality has not changed as rapidly as would be expected for an infarct of this size, or may reflect an underlying mass lesion such as from lymphoma.
If untreated, a lymphoma deposit should progress, and not recede as this has.
Continued followup for resolution or change is recommended to help to differentiate between these potential etiologies.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and trace ascites.
High-grade small bowel obstruction with the transition point in the distal ileum.
New moderate volume ascites, but no free air.
Enlarging bilateral pleural effusions with right lower lobe atelectasis.
Probable mild pulmonary edema.
No lymphadenopathy within the abdomen, or pelvis.
3.0 cm left supraclavicular mass is unchanged from [**2118-11-8**].
Gaseous dilatation of the small bowel, increased compared to CT performed [**2118-11-23**] with gas evident distally.
Findings consistent with partial small bowel obstruction with less likely consideration given to ileus (given presence of SBO on recent CT).
Bibasilar opacifications, likely combination of effusions and atelectasis.
Screen predicts possible synergy with selected penicillins or vancomycin.

Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas as due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.
CD15 stains neutrophils and bands and together with CD45 is difficult to appreciate reactivity among large atypical cells.

Patient had a bone marrow biopsy diagnostic for Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
Pancytopenia: On [**2118-10-10**], patient developed progressive pancytopenia.
Patient had a positive blood culture growing GNR's and sepsis was also considered as an etiology of pancytopenia.
Bone marrow biopsy from [**10-11**] showed classical Hodgkin Lymphoma.
Hodgkin Lymphoma: Patient has a 6+ year history of lymphadenopathy and lymphedema that was previously though to be due to Sarcoid.
Several providers have questioned the diagnosis of Sarcoid given patient's lack of response to steroids and her multiple biopsies which, by report, were inconclusive but most likely consistent with Sarcoid.
SPEP showed trace abnormal band, identified as monoclonal IgG lambda, representing 3% of total protein.
Patient had a bone marrow biopsy on [**10-11**] showing classical Hodgkin Lymphoma, which is stage IV given bone marrow involvement.
She had pulmonary function tests showing a decreased DLCO and was therefore started on AVD chemotherapy with C1D1 on [**2118-10-21**].
Bleomycin was not given due to potential pulmonary toxicity.
Patient tolerated her first cycle well without significant side effects.
Patient had a brain MRI demonstrating a lesion in her left frontal lobe that was very concerning for Hodgkin's.
CSF cytology was negative for malignancy; unfortunately, that result did not definitively rule out CNS Hodgkins.
A repeat brain MRI 2 weeks after the initial scan showed decrease in size of brain lesion, which was deemed more consistent with subacute infarct by neuro-oncology.
Patient was also noted to have pleural effusions, which would render her ineligible for high dose methotrexate, an [**Doctor Last Name 360**] commonly used to treat CNS Hodgkins.
Cytology showed no evidence of malignant cells.
Bacteremia: Patient had an episode of hypotension on [**10-11**] and blood cultures were drawn.
Her PICC line was not pulled due to massive edema and concern for loss of access.
Meropenem was restarted on [**11-12**] given concern for cellulitis  4.
Hyponatremia with hyperkalemia: On presentation to MICU, patient's sodium level was 114.
She appeared mildly symptomatic from her hyponatremia with mental status changes (presumably different than her baseline), but it appeared to have been a somewhat slow decline to 114.
She did not have any concerning EKG findings.
Given her history of high-dose steroids and possibly quick taper to 10mg of prednisone daily in order to start methotrexate, adrenal insufficiency was considered and high-dose stress steroids were administered without effect.
Hypovolemic hyponatremia, paraneoplastic syndrome/SIADH, thyroid disease, and hypervolemia from her lymphedema (though this has been long-standing and Na+ is new), were all considered.
at outside facility, so hypovolemia was considered the most likely scenario and she was continued on fluid resuscitation with good result and Na+ increase at the appropriate rate of 0.5mEq/hr.
TSH known to be slightly elevated prior to admission, with recent increase in her levothyroxine dosing.
A renal work-up was negative for hydronephrosis and again demonstrated sodium avidity with UNa <10, making appropriate ADH in the setting of intravascular depletion most likely.
Acute on chronic kidney injury: Patient was found to have an acute on chronic kidney injury upon presentation.
The Nephrology service was consulted given evidence of a 1.2g protein/creatinine ratio.
The renal team felt there was no urgent indication for biopsy and that proteinuria was likely secondary to recent frequent shifts in intravascular volume causing intrinsic renal disease.
This was felt to be due to intravascular depletion in the setting of limited PO intake and patient was started on TPN and received gentle fluids with return of Cr to baseline.
Anarsarca vs. Lymphedema: Patient's edema is most likely secondary to her large mesenteric LAD prevented effective venous return.
It is has been complicated by remarkable edema and pressure ulcers on her coccyx and along her thighs and lower extremities.
Her edema is likely worsened by her hypoalbuminemia as a result of mild proteinuria from her renal disease.
Patient's edema improved with compression bandages of lower extremities and with her first cycle of AVD.
An MRI showed that her left supraclavicular mass was likely compressing the left subclavian vein and causing LUE edema.
She continued to have anasarca despite interval decrease in size of mesenteric lymph nodes after AVD, and required aggressive diuresis with IV lasix.
Ulcers and Skin Breakdown: Patient was noted to have diffuse skin weeping, and miltiple buttock and bileral lower extremity ulcers and escars.
She was followed by wound care and Dermatology was consulted, who determined her lesions were unlikely to be fungal or vasculitis and did not recommend biopsy.
Patient received daily wound care.
Hypocalcemia with hyperphosphatemia: [**Name (NI) **] PTH was elevated at 282.
It was felt that hypocalcemia may have been exacerbated by low Vitamin D and phosphate retention and precipitation in setting of acute renal failure [**2-24**] dehydration.
Her urine Ca was low (0.3), suggesting appropriate renal conservation of calcium in setting of hypocalcemia.
Patient has been hypercalcemic in the past; unclear what her phosphate and creatinine levels were at that time.
Hypothyroidism: Patient's TSH was slightly elevated at 5.4 on presentation.
She developed hypothermia and was found to have TSH of 11 and low FT4, so endocrine was consulted and she was started on IV levothyroxine, absorption of PO levothyroxine may have been impaired by gut edema.
Patient's daughter approached RN to share concerns that her mother was abusing narcotics and had been addicted to narcotics for many years.
Small bowel obstruction:  Patient developed a small bowel obstruction of unclear etiology.
She had no history of abdominal surgery and CT failed to reveal obstructive masses, though exam is limited.
Hypernatremia:  Patient developed hypernatremia, likely due to gastrointestinal losses (from small bowel obstruction), insensible water losses, and concomittant inability to take PO fluids in the setting of clinical deterioration.
Patient progressively developed altered mental status and tachypnea.
While there was no one clear precipitant, it is likely that she succumbed to her multiple decompensated medical problems.
Palliative care was consulted and she received supportive care with morphine, lorazepam, and haloperidol as needed for comfort.
