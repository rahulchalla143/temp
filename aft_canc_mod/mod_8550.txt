Admission Date:  [**2151-1-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-1-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2077-3-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4057**] Chief Complaint: LLQ pain, presented for chemotherapy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization Intra aortic ballon pump Bare metal stent placement (x 2) Hemodialysis   History of Present Illness: Pt is a 73 y.o male with h.o NHL, CHF with EF 30%, AS, ESRD on HD MWF, afib, DM2, hypogammuloglobulinema who presents with LLQ abdominal pain.
He developed LLQ pain that radiates around left side to back, similar in nature to the pain he had during his last admission that was felt to be d/t mesenteric/RP lymphadenopathy and responded well to chemotherapy.
No other abdominal pain, nausea, emesis, melena, hematochezia, diarrhea, or constipation.
Also feels completely worn out, fatigued, with a decreased appetite and feels like 'my whole body is exploding'.
Concerned that his cancer is progressing and was sent from rehab for evaluation and chemotherapy.
Recently admitted [**Date range (1) 101001**] for chest pain and was found to have unstable angina with stenosis of LAD and PDA at cath, s/p BMS.
He also had enlarging supraclavicular and cervical lymph nodes and back pain and had evidence of rapidly progressive lymphoma on CT with concern for high grade transformation.
His chemotherapy was complicated by pancytopenia for which he was started on neupogen, tumor lysis for which he received allopurinol and rasburicase, and febrile neutropenia of unknown etiology treated with vanc/zosyn.
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, slowly progressive (follicular low-grade B-cell NHL grade I, diagnosed in [**2142**]), on Bendemustine with partial response, has had recurrence on other  meds, over past month or so palpable lymphadenopathy seems to have returned 2.
Congestive heart failure likely secondary to combination of moderate aortic stenosis and adriamycin cardiomyopathy EF 30%; EFs have been improving recently, have been as low as 25% in past 3.
Aortic Stenosis (moderate) 4.
End-stage kidney disease on HD MWF (secondary to diabetic nephropathy; has had trauma to one kidney in childhood) 5.
Atrial fibrillation, recently diagnosed 6.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (on glipizide) 7.
He does not drink alcohol and denies the use of illicit or illegal drugs.
Family History: Mother had diabetes mellitus and died at the age of [**Age over 90 **] years.
There is no family history of sudden death or premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease  Physical Exam: VS: 97.0, 101/56, 93, 16, 92% RA GENERAL: NAD HEENT: NCAT.
NECK: Supple, no appreciable cervical or supraclavicular LAD CARDIAC: RRR, normal S1, S2, III/VI SEM at RUSB LUNGS: crackles at bases bilaterally ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND, + BS, no rebound or guarding EXTREMITIES: No c/c/e.
Intraventricular conduction delay.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
Differences in precordial R wave progression may be related to lead position, seen better on the present study.
EKG: Normal sinus rhythm, rate 99, with first degree A-V block.
Intraventricular conduction delay of left bundle-branch block type.
Cannot exclude anteroseptal and/or inferior myocardial infarction of indeterminate age.
Borderline left atrial abnormality.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2150-12-16**] R waves are markedly diminished across the anterior precordium consistent with possible interval anterior myocardial infarction.
CXR PA/LAT [**1-5**] No evidence of new infiltrates.
Elevated left hemidiaphragm with probable elevated stomach bubble beneath.
If there is clinical concern for empyema or other cause of gas in the pleural space, further evaluation with PA and lateral radiographs or with chest CT would be recommended.
Unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions.
MICRO: sputum gram stain and cx neg x 2 C. dif and stool cx neg   Brief Hospital Course: 73 year-old gentleman with history of ESRD on HD, chronic sCHF (EF 30%), moderate to severe AS (valve area 0.9), CAD with BMS to RCA on [**2150-11-27**], recent NSTEMI on [**2150-12-7**], and B-cell lymphoma with recent chemotherapy with vincritine and rituximab c/b tumor-lysis syndrome presents for chemo with symptoms of LLQ pain consistent with prior lymphoma symptoms.
Patient presented with LLQ pain thought [**2-16**] progressive lymphoma.
This pain was improved with chemotherapy, but after 1 day of chemo his course was complicated by hospital-acquired pneumonia, as well as cardiac pain found to be an anterior STEMI requiring IABP placement and multiple stents to the LAD.
Although at baseline the patient had low SBP (100s-110s), following his cardiac intervention and CCU stay his SBPs began to gradually deteriorate over the course of the next week.
Initially this resulted in no changes in mental status and did not interfere with HD, but eventually once his SBPs began to dip into the high 60s, Nephrology felt that they could not proceed with HD and the patient began to have transient episodes of confusion.
