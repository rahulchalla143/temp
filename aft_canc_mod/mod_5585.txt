She was doing okay at home, with increasing PO intake and a stable level of pain and nausea however over the last few days, her pain has worsened.
She had a workup at [**Hospital **] hospital which showed no fractures or other process, and was discharged within a few hours to [**Hospital 5682**] ECF again.
Over the last few days at [**Hospital 5682**], paitent has complained of worsening pain and stable nausea.
Denies any vomiting, constipation, cough, fevers, chills, or other symptoms.
She presented today for worsening pain despite her pain medications.
Pain is stabbing in nature associated with nausea.
Also thinks that her fistual output may be increasing.
ED exam with diffuse ttp mainly over the RUQ/RLQ.
CT abd/pelvis with Left lower lobe opacification compatible with pneumonia, decreased mid abdominal collection.
Surgery consulted in ED, recommended CT abd with contrast, CT abd was done which showed abscesses largely unchanged but LLL PNA.
Surgery recommended no intervention now, admit to medicine for IV abx for PNA with surgery following.
Per daughter who gave most history, patient veyr often gets like this after receiving pain or anxiety medications.
Per Opt ID note: Subsequent course after initial surgery was complicated by polymicrobial BSI (Enterobacter cloacae, VRE, MRSA, Clostridium) and hepatic abscess requiring drainage on [**6-1**] (Enterobacter, Enterococcus) s/p drain removal and prolonged course of antibiotic therapy (daptomycin, ertapenem) ending [**7-6**].
She was re-admitted on [**7-15**] with a recurrent fluid collection.
She underwent CT guided drainage of that major collection and cultures grew [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans and [**Female First Name (un) 29361**], VRE.
In the setting of a persistent leukocytosis, she was found to have a new liver abscess on [**7-30**] and underwent CT guided drainage with fluid growing VRE, MRSA and yeast.
however due to abdominal cramping which may have been in part related to tigecycline, her regimen was changed to daptomycin, ertapenem, and fluconazole on [**2129-8-11**].
On [**8-17**] she was readmitted to the hospital for elevation of LFTs and increasing abdominal pain.
CT of the abdomen on [**8-17**] showed an increased fluid collection in the caudate lobe of the liver measuring 2.1x2.3cm.
Decision was made to maintain the patient on Meropenem on discharge instead of ertapenem for coverage of Enterbacter which grew previously as she seemed to have improvement in her abdominal pain, transaminitis, and remained afebrile with Meropenem.
