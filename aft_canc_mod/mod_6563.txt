Per history she denies any CVA tenderness or suprapubic tenderness, nausea, vomiting or any other constitutional symptoms.
Upon arrival to the ED the patient was found to be afebrile at 98.9 80 104/58 14 100%.
A head CT was done that revealed possible brain edema vs acute infarct.
Past Medical History: - Stage IV NSCLC c/b Brain Metastases, Concurrent Intraparenchymal and Leptomeningeal Metastases on carboplatin and pemetrexed - PVD (s/p angioplasty at age 36, and underwent subsequent angioplasties until eventual aortobifemoral bypass graft done in [**2185**] with success) - HTN - HLD - s/p knee repair i1974 - s/p CCY [**2190**]   Social History: Worked as an employer specialist in a firm.
No significant etoh intake.
Physical Exam: GEN: diaphoretic, NAD, lethargic but arousable  HEENT: atraumatic, EOMI, PERRL, right gaze preference, dry MM, neck supple, JVP difficult to assess [**12-31**] body habitus  CV: RRR, nl S1+S2, III/VI holosystolic murmur heard best at LLSB, no rubs or gallops  LUNG: CTAB anteriorly & laterally  ABD: soft, NT/ND, hypoactive bowel sounds, no HSM  EXT: W/WP, no C/C/E, 2+ DP/PT pulses bilaterally  GU: foley in place  SKIN: positive skin tenting in lower extremities, stage I ulcer on buttocks, no rashes or lesions appreciated  NEURO: A+Ox2 (person, ??????hospital??????
), CN II-XII intact with no focal deficit, face symmetric, no dysarthria, patient with R gaze preference and head turned preferentially to right although will turn head L to command.
Increased hypoattenuation in the right temporal lobe may represent increased edema from the known right temporal metastasis, an acute infarct, or an infectious process.
An MRI could be helpful for further evaluation.
Abnormal signal in the right temporal lobe, corresponding to the hypodensity seen on recent CT, with imaging characteristics concerning for herpes encephalitis, or less likely vasculitis.
Multiple bilateral small metastatic lesions, stable in size and appearance compared to most recent MRI.
No new lesions seen.
No hydrocephalus.
No subfalcine or uncal herniation.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
EEG:  showed abnormal sz activity in right temporal lobe but final read pnd  Brief Hospital Course: #Hyponatremia: Na 122 on admission, most consistent with hypovolemic hyponatremia, but also concern for SIADH given intracranial pathology from mets and worsening edema.
Most Consistent with hypovolemic hyponatremia.
However, given known brain metastases with CT changes concerning for worsening edema as well as NSCLC, SIADH could also be contributing to hyponatremia but given response to fluids less likely  #Altered mental status: Likely secondary to hyponatremia vs herpes/malignant encephalitis given MRI and EEG changes.
MRI did not show new mets, but did show abnormal signal in right temporal lobe, as well as EEG showing abnormal activity in that region so pt started on keppra.
Concern was most for malignant menengitis.
CSF positive for HSV encephalitis.
Nonconvulsive status-- Frequent electographic seizures from right temporal region, as well as right temporal periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges.
Electrographic seizures recurred on [**9-3**] and were refractory to increased levetiracetam and loading dose of phenytoin.
She became obtunded and was transferred to neuro ICU for closer monitoring of seizures.
Acyclovir was discontinued, but lacosamide and levetiracetam were continued to prevent recurrent seizures.
She then became unresponsive later in the day and remained so for the remainder of her course.
UA neg for leuk esterase and nitrites but partially treated & bacteria/WBCs present.
Given ongoing fevers and immunosuppression, we continued abx with CTX 1g daily, (d/c cipro given risk to decrease seizure threshold).
Will tx for total 7 day course for complicated UTI   # Stage IV NSCLC: C/b metastases to brain and right ilium, s/p XRT.
Patient was made CMO on thursday [**9-5**] after discussions with her husband and daughter.
Upon physical exam, it was confirmed that she did not have a pulse, heart sounds or lung sounds.
She did not respond to verbal or noxious stimuli.
Her cause of death was most likely respiratory failure secondary to her primary diagnoses of metastatic lung cancer and HSV encephalitis.
