Admission Date:  [**2132-7-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-8-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2082-9-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 20506**] Chief Complaint: Right hemiparesis and aphasia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 7474**] is a 49 year old right handed man with a history of high-grade, ACTH positive pituitary adenoma status post debulking surgeries in [**2127**] and [**3-/2132**] with post-op radiotherapy treatments at [**Hospital1 2025**], on Ketoconazole suppressive treatment presented today to the ED with transient episodes of right sided weakness and aphasia.
Upon arrival, he was assessed as having a NIHSS of 0.
However, after non-contrast head CT was performed, Mr. [**Known lastname 7474**] became right sided hemiparetic with right facial droop and was found to be aphasic.
He was taken back to the scanner and a CT perfusion / angiogram were performed which identified patent vessels, but increased cerebral blood volume in the left hemisphere.
Past Medical History: - Pituitary Adenoma diagnosed in [**2126**], initially measuring 3.3 cm with extension into the left cavernous sinus with hypercortisolism and symmetric proximal muscle weakness status post resections in [**2127**]/[**2132**] and fractional radiotherapy - in [**2127**] (52.2 [**Doctor Last Name **]), and [**6-/2132**] (17 [**Doctor Last Name **]); now medically managed on ketoconazole, - Multiple episodes of Pneumonia in [**2132**] - Hypertension - Hypokalemia - Developmental Disability v. Highly Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder   Social History: No recent tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use (distant tobacco and alcohol use).
He lived independently with family for about eight years until his tumor five years ago, at which time he required more assistance for which he was placed into a group home for those with cognitive issues.

No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Extremities:warm and well perfused Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.
No pronator drift bilaterally.
No adventitious movements, such as tremor, noted.
No asterixis noted.
-Coordination: No intention tremor, no dysdiadochokinesia noted.
No dysmetria on FNF or HKS bilaterally.
Able to walk in tandem without difficulty.
Subacute infarctions involving the left thalamus and posterior limb of the internal capsule.
Numerous foci of bilateral white matter FLAIR signal hyperintensity, which in the context of the slow diffusion seen in the thalamus suggest prior areas of microvascular infarction.
Large, incompletely characterized lesion with associated bony erosion in the superior portion of the clivus, eroding anteriorly into the sphenoid sinus and superiorly to the floor of the sella turcica.
Considerations favor an entity such as a chordoma, though lesions of sellar origin, or a sinus malignancy may have a similar appearance.
CTA HEAD WITH & WITHOUT CONTRAST & RECONSTRUCTION - [**2132-7-29**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CT perfusion suggests the possibility of subtle ischemia in the left parietal lobe, corresponding to area of hypodensity on the preceding head CT. No evidence for an infarct.
Recommend MR for further evaluation.
No cervical or intracranial arterial occlusion or stenosis.
Clival mass eroding into the sphenoid sinuses and sellar floor.
Diagnostic possibilities include chordoma, chondrosarcoma (though there is no classic arcs-and-rings matrix), metastatic disease and ectopic pituitary macroadenoma.
Enlarge right thyroid lobe with multiple nodules, some of which are calcified.
Recommend further evaluation by [**Name (NI) 13416**], if not performed previously.
Asymmetric bilateral subcortical hypodensities are most prominent in the left frontal and parietal lobes.
Given the asymmetry and the clinical history, these may be due to acute early infarction.
Alternatively, this may represent asymmetric white matter disease due to chronic small vessel ischemia.
Ill-defined soft tissue mass in the skull base with erosion of the adjacent clivus and involvement of the sphenoid sinus.
These findings are suggestive of underlying mass lesion, potentially pituitary in origin, with superimposed post treatment changes.

He was also noted to be apneic as evidenced by an elevated respiratory rate, and loud snoring.
As the patient was still having episodes concerning for complex partial seizures, Mr. [**Known lastname 7474**] was loaded with 1250mg of Phenytoin (16 mg / kg) and started on 100mg three times per day, and continued on Keppra 1g twice a day.
Over the course of the next 24 hours, EEG revealed no epileptiform activity, and a generalized delta wave with transition to theta wave activity upon agitations.
Of note, the patient overnight was responsive to command, but showed marked decrease in activity in his right upper / lower extremities.
On repeat evaluation, the patient had just had a conversation with his cousin, was answering appropriately and noted no complaints except a sore throat likely secondary to irritation from the endotracheal tube.
Subsequent evaluation of Mr. [**Known lastname 7474**] revealed improving strength in his right upper and lower extremities, where upon discharge he was found to have equal strength bilaterally in his upper and lower extremities, with only mild deficits in arm extension.
On the evening of [**8-5**], the patient became hypotensive to the high-80 systolic blood pressures.
Over the course of the next 24 hours on maintainence fluids, Mr. [**Known lastname 7474**] was able to maintain normotension with no additional fluid bolus, pressors, or inotropes.
Genitourinary: The patient on the morning of [**7-31**] was noted to have swelling of his uncircumcised foreskin and some irritation of the anterior aspect of the glans.
No additional intervention was recommended, except aggressive contact was avoided for 24 hours  Hematologic: Mr. [**Known lastname 7474**] experienced a drop in his hemoglobin on the first night of admission which was in the setting of aggressive hydration and a bolus of normal saline.
Of note, the complete blood count reported a pan-measure drop, which likely suggested a dilutional phenomenon.
Subsequent complete blood counts showed increased hemoglobin.
He also was administered ranitidine to prevent acid reflux.
