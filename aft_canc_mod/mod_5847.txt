Consolidations in the right upper lobe as well as in the lingula, inferior left upper lobe and likely left lower lobe are highly worrisome for multifocal pneumonia.
Trace bilateral pleural effusions may be present.
No pneumothorax is seen.
Bilateral lung opacities, in similar distribution compared to prior, appear more organized on the left, concerning for multifocal pneumonia.
Central lucency in the left perihilar opacity, could be small cavitation; although to early to tell.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Stable mass-like right upper lobe opacity concerning for malignancy as suggested on recent CT. .
Right upper lobe mass as well as findings compatible with multifocal pneumonia.
The mass in the right upper lobe may also represent pneumonia, but short interval followup is recommended to exclude a mass lesion.
Small bilateral effusions.
No cavitary lesions within the lungs.
Renal cysts.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 year old man with h/o Hodkins s/p XRT/splenectomy, transfusion dependent MDS with anemia/thrombocytopenia, CAD/CABG, Gout, hypothyroidism admitted with acute onset fever/chills/cough/hypoxia, found to have multifocal PNA with mild sepsis.
Multifocal PNA with resolved pneumosepsis:  Acute onset in asplenic patient with MDS.
Presented with mild sepsis and admitted ICU initially.
Recieved fluids, oxygen, and 72hours of broad Abx: Vanc, levo/flagyl, CTx to cover for severe CAP with MRSA coverage.
Since he remained afebrile and his Blood Cx remain negative after 72hours, his Abx were narrowed to Levo only on [**6-4**] with plan for 7days course (has one more day left on discharge).
His sputum gram stain showed GPCs in pair but culture showed sparse OP flora.
By time of discharge, his cough was improved, he had good sats on RA, and was afebrile for several days.
Of note, he underwent a CT scan shortly after admission given concern for mass/cavitation on CXR in RUL.
This showed multifocal PNA but also showed a more dense RUL mass.
While this is most likely also the PNA, pt does have a h/o XRT to chest.
He reports h/o R lung "nodule" but cant clarify details as PCP was out of town.
MDS with anemia and thrombocytopenia: per covering PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 5348**] hct 25-28 and plt 30s).
He had some mild hematuria (with foley) in ICU and got 1Pack of plts, but this dropped his counts rather than improved.
While aware of the potential side effect of BM supression with colchine, we were limited with options for treatment (did not tolerate NSAIDs in past and had active infection and DM so didnt want to do prolonged steroids).
He had significant improvement with this regimen and no symptoms on discharge.
CAD/CABG: Initial EKGs had some lateral ST changes c/w with some demand related changes which improved on repeat EKG.
He had a mild trop leak (0.05) but no ACS.
This was consistent with underlying CAD.
Given his issues of severe TCP, we decreased his ASA from 325mg to 81mg.
Given tachycardia at [**Hospital1 5348**], consider titrating down lisinopril so that can titrate up metoprolol (limited by BP currently).

You were diagnosed with severe pneumonia.
Your CAT scan showed that you have a large mass in your right upper lung.
You also have myelodysplastic syndrome which causes severe anemia and low platelet counts.
There was no bleeding.
You also recieved some platelets because you had slight pinkish urine.
Due to your increased risk of bleeding with low plateles, we have decreased your aspirin to BABY aspirin 81mg.
Please discuss whether you should stop altogether with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10543**] or your cardiologist.
You also had a gout flare while you were here.
