She presented intially to her PCP 2 days back with cough and was given levoflox.
However continued to have worsening cough with phlegm and difficulty swallowing.
Imaging showed aspiration PNA and did not show any PE or significant pericardial effusion.
She was admitted to the ICU given her low pulm reserve and likely semi-urgent esophageal stent placement.
Left vocal cord paralysis 3.
[**2105**]: Recurrent dz in pleural space.
2 cycles of carboplatin and Taxol given, still with pulm progression.
Tx complicated by thrombocytopenia and PE on CT, started on Lovenox.
[**2108**]: Brachial plexus MRI showed tumor L paraspinal region from T2-T5 [**2108**]: 4 cycles of dose-reduced cisplatin, Navelbine [**2108**]: CT showed renal hepatic progression.
[**2108**]: MRI showed leptomeningeal enhancement L frontal lobe.
[**2109**]: weekly epirubicin, received 3 cycles, but multiple doses were held because of poor performance status.
Social History: She does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol.

There has been progressive opacification of the right hemithorax over the series of studies, which may represent confluent aspiration pneumonitis.
The patient is s/p left pneumonectomy and tubular- appearing, presumably pleural, calcifications in the medial left hemithorax are unchanged.
Again demonstrated are esophageal stent in situ, with slight narrowing at its mid-portion, as before, as well as right subclavian venous access device with tip likely at the cavo-atrial junction or high right atrium.
No PE and no significant pericardial effusion.
Patchy airspace disease in the right lower lobe consistent with aspiration pneumonitis.
Brief Hospital Course: 50 y/o F w/ h/o adenoid cystic carcinoma, GERD, PE, presented with aspiration pneumonitis in the setting of likely obstructed esophageal stent.
# Aspiration PNA: Aspiration from obstructed esophageal stent in the setting of widely metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma.
Patient was maintained NPO and started on Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin, Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia.
Given end-stage carcinoma and high likelihood of repeated aspiration events in the setting of esophageal obstruction and stent failure, goals of care were changed to comfort measures only after discussion with family on day 2 of admission.
Patient received morphine for respiratory distress.
# adenoid cystic carcinoma: Patient with known widely metastatic disease on admission; was home hospice but family reversed it 2 days prior to admission as the service was not helping the patient to be comfortable.
Patient was given morphine for pain and comfort.
