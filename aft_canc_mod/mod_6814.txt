The patient is reported by EMS records to have been supine in bed, awake, but unresponsive to verbal or painful stimuli, additionally noted to be incontinent of urine and feces.
The patient had a CT head which revealed no acute process and had a normal CXR.
Given history of distant breast CA a CTA was performed which revealed no evidence of PE or metastatic disease but did reveal a cirrhotic appearing liver and small ascites on abdominal cuts.
She has no known history of seizure disorder or large stroke although has had history of microvascular disease.
She has not had episodes of hepatic encephalopathy previously, is not currently maintained on lactulose.
Breast Cancer - s/p right mastectomy - no recurrent disease known to date #.
Alcoholic Cirrhosis - quit ETOH > 10 years ago #.
Aortic stenosis s/p AVR #.
COPD #.
NG tube with clear fluid with some brown debris, trace gastroccult + Neck: JVp visible to 6-7 cm Chest: s/p Right mastectomy.
Generally clear to auscultation anterior and posterior without rales, rhonchi or wheezes Cor: RRR, normal S1/S2.
No obvious murmurs, rubs or gallops Abd: mod distended, obese, + umbilical hernia.
fluid wave Rectal: Performed in ED, brown trace guaiac+ stool Ext: no edema.
DP 2+ bilaterally Neuro: Limited secondary to recent sedation.
Admission ECG: Normal sinus rhythm with right bundle-branch block and occasional premature ventricular contractions.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Breathing artifact degrades the quality of the study.
Ascending aortic graft is seen with no complication noted.
There are no filling defects within the main pulmonary artery to the segmental and larger subsegmental branches to suggest pulmonary embolism.
However, evaluation of the subsegmental branches is limited due to respiratory motion artifact.
Atherosclerotic calcifications within the aorta.
Small left- sided pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis.
There is suggestion of chronic sternal dehiscense.
There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy.
Small 12mm x 8mm focal density is within the central left breast.
Tiny granuloma is seen within the spleen.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Limited study without evidence of central and segmental PE.
Small left-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
Small mass within the left breast, correlate with recent mammogram, if obtained.
T1 axial, sagittal and coronal images were obtained following gadolinium.
There are no prior examinations for comparison.
FINDINGS: Diffusion images demonstrate subtle area of slow diffusion involving both thalami.
No cortical infarcts are identified.
Pre-gadolinium T1 images demonstrate hyperintensities involving the basal ganglia, predominantly the globus pallidus and putamen, but also involvement of the upper brainstem.
Multiple small foci of T2 hyperintensity indicative of mild- to-moderate changes of small vessel disease also identified.
Following gadolinium, no abnormal parenchymal, vascular, or meningeal enhancement seen.
There is a fluid level in the left maxillary sinus.
Subtle slow diffusion identified in both thalami could be secondary to global hypoxic event.
Increased T1 pre-gadolinium signal in basal ganglia could be secondary to hepatic insufficiency.
No enhancing brain lesions.
Mild-to-moderate changes of small vessel disease.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 77355**] is an 82 year old female admitted with decreased responsiveness ultimately attributed to non-convulsive status epilepticus.
There was some evidence on brain MR of changes associated with hypoxia.
It was unclear whether these may have triggered the seizures or been a result of them; there was no obvious inciting event to cause respiratory failure.
The pt was seen and followed by the neurology service who made the diagnosis of non-convulsive status epilepticus via serial EEG.
*** If the pt experiences an acute mental status change in the future, consideration should be given to repeat seizure.
The pt also continues to be treated with lactulose in case hepatic encephalopathy was contributing her condition.
CHF: The pt is thought to carry a diagnosis of CHF based on her home medications, although there was limited data available in the [**Hospital1 18**] system.
She was thought to be mildly volume up at admission and was started on low-dose Lasix; after this, she appeared clinically euvolemic throughout her course.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 511**] Siani, [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: decreased responsiveness non-convulsive seizures .
Secondary: history of breast cancer alcoholic cirrhosis COPD CHF   Discharge Condition: Vital signs stable.
Without seizure activity.
Discharge Instructions: -You were admitted with decreased responsiveness and found to be having non-convulsive seizures.
We have treated you with anti-seizure medications.
--> Lasix was started to help remove excess fluid from your body.
Also seek medical attention if you develop any new fever, chills, trouble breathing, chest pain, nausea, vomiting or unusual stools.
