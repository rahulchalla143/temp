symetrical bilaterally.
SKIN: No edema  Pertinent Results: Studies:  [**10-22**] cxr: no acute cardiopulmonary pathology.
[**10-23**] MRI L-spine: Again identified are extensive vertebral body signal intensity abnormalities compatible with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma.
Again seen is a spherical region of hypointensity on the short TR images in the L2 vertebral body.
There is no evidence of cauda equina compression.
Axial images at T11-12, [**1-3**], [**2-3**], and [**3-7**] demonstrate mild degenerative disc disease with no evidence of canal or foraminal encroachment.
At L3-4, there is a protrusion of the intervertebral disc entering the right side of the spinal canal.
At L4-5, there is asymmetric bulge of the intervertebral disc with no evidence of nerve root compression.
There is right-sided facet joint osteophyte formation.
At L5-S1, there is a minimal bulge of the intervertebral disc with no encroachment on the thecal sac or neural foramina.
Signal intensity abnormalities compatible with the history of myeloma are also noted in the visualized portions of the sacrum and the iliac bones.
[**10-25**] CT head: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or infarction.
Again noted are carotid artery calcifications and a large mucus retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus.
[**10-25**] MRI/MRA of the head: MRI OF THE HEAD: IMPRESSION: There is no evidence of acute ischemic changes.
After the administration of gadolinium contrast, there is no evidence of abnormal enhancement.
No diffusion abnormalities are detected.
Prominence of the sulci and ventricles, likely age-related and involutional nature.
IMPRESSION: Possible narrowing of the M2 and M3 segments bilaterally, more evident on the right, possibly arteriosclerotic in nature, however, artifact cannot be completely ruled out, correlation with CTA of the head and neck is recommended if clinically warranted.
[**10-26**] Carotid US: No evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis.
[**10-28**] CT head: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or large acute infarction.

# Near syncope/weakness/fall:  The patient has a history of [**Month/Year (2) **] dysfunction with multiple similar episodes.
Midodrine was added to the regimen, and thereafter, he had no further episodes of near syncope.
Because [**Month/Year (2) **] dysfunction in the setting of MM may be caused by amyloidosis, a bone marrow biopsy was done on [**10-23**] which showed did not show evidence of amyloidosis.
# Confusion/aphasia: On the morning of the [**10-26**], he was participating in physical therapy when he was noted to have difficulty speaking with expressive aphasia.
His daughter stated that his orthostatic hypotension has also been worsening lately and on Friday [**10-22**] he had syncopized while in a chair.)
For his hypotension, he was given 500cc of NS, SBP improved to 120, and his aphasia resolved.
Thereafter his SBP dropped to 110 and his aphasia returned.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient was volume rescucitated for hypotension and found to have UTI with staph aureus.
MRI and CT head without evidence of acute stroke.
Carotid ultrasound showed no significant stenosis.
Neurology consult saw the patient and felt that his mental status changes and hypotension in the acute setting were secondary to his infection rather than CVA or dysautonomia.
With treatment of the UTI, supine hypotension and mental status changes resolved.
The afternoon of [**10-28**], the patient was woken from sleep and was found to be confused and slow to speak.
With further fluid resuscitation and the addition of midodrine to his dysautonomia regimen, his symptoms resolved.
He was transferred back to the floor on [**10-29**] with baseline mental status.
He had no further episodes of confusion.
On discharge, the patient continued to have orthostatic blood pressure changes, with SBP falling from ~160 supine to ~100 standing, but he was asymptomatic and these were stable findings.
# Staph Aureus UTI: He was initially on vanc/cefepime for a catheter-associated UTI.
# Urinary retention: The patient has a history of BPH, but has had increased urinary retention since a recent hospitalization requiring an indwelling catheter at home.
Due to his increasing urinary retension, a MRI of his L-spine was done which showed multiple signal abnormalities in the bones, but no cord compression.
# Multiple myeloma/Chronic lower back pain:  Mr. [**Known lastname 14780**] was noted to have known malignant compression fractures due to MM.
His pain was controlled with oxycodone prn.

Your known to have [**Location (un) **] dysfucntion and this was likely the cause of your event.
You had multiple episodes of confusion which were likely due to low blood pressure due to your [**Location (un) **] dysfunction.
You were also found to have a urinary tract infection and treated with IV antibiotics.
Call your primary oncologist, or if after hours call the page operator at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2756**] and ask for the [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3242**] (bone marrow transplant) fellow on call if you experience fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, bleeding which doesn't stop immediately, blood in your stool, or dark tarry stool.
