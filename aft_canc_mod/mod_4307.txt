Admission Date:  [**2138-11-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-12-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2066-10-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal Pain Dizziness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2138-11-25**]: U/S guided paracentesis [**2138-11-27**]: PICC line placement angiogram [**12-8**], [**12-11**], [**12-12**] egd [**12-8**], [**12-11**], [**12-12**]  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 72 y/o male w/ h/o HBV s/p right hepatectomy for HCC on [**2138-11-7**] discharged from hospital [**2138-10-24**] now complaining of severe abdominal pain and dizziness.
There were no exacerbating or mitigating factors to pain.
Pain was accompanied by nausea without vomiting, febrile symptoms with temperature to 100, and dizziness.
Pain became unbearable by 2AM, interfering with sleep, at which point he called the hepatobiliary clinic number and was scheduled for an appointment for today ([**11-25**]).
Noted pedal edema has worsened despite taking diuretics.
Patient denies vomiting, melena, hematochezia, chest pain, and change in bowel habits.
Past Medical History: hepatocellular carcinoma, s/p right hepatectomy [**2138-11-7**], hepatitis B, benign prostatic hypertrophy, elevated PSA, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP, appendectomy  Social History: He is married with 2 children.
He has no history of IV drug use, marijuana use, tattoos, or piercing.
Right-sided moderate pleural effusion, left trace pleural effusion, new since [**2138-10-10**].
10 x 8 x 11 cm homogenous fluid collection in the sugical resection bed with mass effect on remnant left hepatic lobe is noted.
[**2138-11-25**] U/S abd: no protal vein thrombosis.
Status post right hepatectomy with large complex fluid collection in the post-surgical bed measuring up to 8.8 cm in size.
This is likely unchanged in size given differences in imaging technique since [**2138-11-25**].
Moderate-sized right pleural effusion as seen before.
there were no esophageal varices.
[**2138-12-8**]: celiac angiogram: subtle areas of abnormality in the artery supplying peripheral branches of the right side of liver.
In addition, a small area of contrast blush was noted arising from the gastroduodenal artery in the region of the duodenal bulb.
Successful particle embolization of abnormal right hepatic artery branch.
Successful coil and Gelfoam embolization of active extravasation noted from a branch of the gastroduodenal artery.
This was consistent with either a very large diverticulum or a large ulcer crater (less likely).
The tissue in this crater/diverticulum was ulcerated and slightly necrotic, c/w recent embolization.
There was active hemorrhage seen from the ampula of bright red blood.
[**2138-12-12**] EGD: Blood in the lower third of the esophagus.
This was seen and described on his prior EGD, and likely represents a large diverticulum.
There was dark blood in the diverticulum as well as diffuse, surrounding erosions and scar c/w recent embolization.
There was no active bleeding coming from this area.
Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis; left is new since [**2138-11-25**].
Homogenous fluid collection in surgical bed of right hepatectomy decreased in size with no focal hypodensities of concern.
Increased intraperitoneal fluid with slight increase in density compared to [**11-25**] study may represent increased proteinaceous component or component of hemoperitoneum.
No retroperitoneal fluid noted.
Patient underwent ultrasound-guided drain placement with drainage of 650 cc of peritoneal fluid, which revealed [**Numeric Identifier 87932**] WBCs and rare ESBL E Coli, consistent with secondary peritonitis.
On [**11-28**] vancomycin was discontinued, while Zosyn was continued due to final culture results.
The HIT antibody was positive, pending serotonin release assay results, and [**Location (un) 2274**] Hematology was consulted, who recommended initiation of bivalrudin given association of HIT with thrombotic events.
Patient complained of diffuse abdominal pain, but hematocrit was stable at 30-32 and patient was hemodynamically stable.
On [**12-6**] patient was found to be dizzy and hypotensive with melanotic stool.
The morning of [**12-8**] melena resumed, with a drop in HCT from 35 to 30 to 21.2 with INR 2.4.
The morning of [**12-11**] patient had another bleeding episode with a decline in HCT from 27 to 24 despite 4u pRBCs.
He was intubated for airway protection in the setting of bleeding and worsening confusion.
Repeat EGD by hepatology showed blood spurting from the ampulla, suggestive of hemobilia, and duskiness of the duodenum consistent with prior embolization.
Repeat EGD, on [**12-12**] showed ulcerated duodenum with diffuse oozing but no hemobilia.
Patient returned to IR for a third time.
No bleeding was identified and no further emoblization was performed out of concern for duodenal necrosis.
