Preoperative CT angiography demonstrates resectability and he now presents for a Whipple procedure.
There was no guaranteed diagnosis of cancer in the preoperative period, however, on the basis of a suspected but unproven malignancy, we decided to proceed.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2142-10-17**] 6:08 PM  CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  Reason: 75 yo s/p whipple with n/v Field of view: 42  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 75 year old man with REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: 75 yo s/p whipple with n/v CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: Cr= 1.4  INDICATION: 75-year-old man status post Whipple with nausea and vomiting.
FINDINGS: There are bilateral small pleural effusions.
Atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries is incompletely visualized as is calcification of the aortic valve.
There is bibasilar atelectasis.
There is expected pneumobilia seen, principally in the left lobe.
No drainable fluid collections are identified.
Slightly distended loops of contrast- filled small bowel are seen in the left abdomen without distal decompression.
No free intraperitoneal air is identified.
There is diffuse mild mesenteric stranding.
Bilateral small fat-containing inguinal hernias are seen.
A small amount of free fluid is seen in the pelvis.
The osseous structures demonstrate no concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Inflammatory change around the pancreaticojejunostomy surgical site, with milder stranding throughout the mesentery.
Pneumobilia and ascites.
Mildly distended small bowel loops with air and stool seen throughout the colon.
Atrial flutter with controlled ventricular response.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2142-10-14**] atrial flutter with controlled ventricular response has appeared.
pneumonia  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 75 year old man with s/p whipple with high WBC REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: ?
pneumonia EXAMINATION: Two views of the chest.
There remains bibasilar atelectasis with a right-sided pleural effusion.
A left-sided pleural effusion has almost completely resolved.
There is no evidence of congestive failure on the current examination.
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar atelectasis with persistent right pleural effusion and likely small left pleural effusion.
Left ventricular function.

[**First Name (STitle) 251**] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]  MEASUREMENTS: Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: *4.1 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm) Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.9 cm (nl <= 5.2 cm) Right Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.4 cm (nl <= 5.0 cm) Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: 1.1 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm)  Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: 1.1 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm) Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 5.0 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm) Left Ventricle - Systolic Dimension: 3.5 cm Left Ventricle - Fractional Shortening: 0.30 (nl >= 0.29) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: >= 55% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Valve Level: 3.6 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm) Aorta - Ascending: 3.2 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm) Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 1.3 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec)  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o cardiopulmonary pathology CHEST RADIOGRAPH  INDICATION: 75-year-old man status post Whipple procedure, now with atrial fibrillation.
FINDINGS: Since prior examination, there is interval development of bibasilar opacities with increased pulmonary vasculature consistent with CHF.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
The cardiac silhouette cannot be accurately assessed due to overlying opacity.
EXTENT OF INVASION  Primary Tumor:  pT3:  Tumor extends beyond the pancreas but without involvement of the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2142-10-15**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2142-10-17**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup is performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from the       site (including a screen for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus       aureus and beta streptococcus).
MODERATE GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt under went a pylorus perserving whipple, open chole for painless jaundice, pruritis, weight loss his post operative course was complicated by rapid a-fib (HR in 120s) and a wound infection.
At the time of discharge he was rate controlled and hemodynamicly stable, tolerating a regular diet, had good pain control on po pain medications, ambulating, had return of bowel and bladder function and had the central portion of his wound opened and packed with wet to dry dressings.
