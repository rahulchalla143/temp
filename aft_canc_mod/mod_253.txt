EMS to OSH with progressive neurologic decline requiring intubation.
Ct showed large right frontoparietal hemorrhage with extension into right lateral ventricle with casting into 3rd and 4th.
Also several lesions present.
Afebrile for 24+ hours.
head incision is C/D/I  Pertinent Results: CT Head [**2163-1-2**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Large right frontoparietal hemorrhage, with vasogenic edema, extending into the ventricles.
Multiple foci of hyperdensity with round shape in the brain, concerning for possible underlying secondary deposits.
Please correlate with history of primary cancer if available.
MRI is recommended for further evaluation of the underlying disease.
No new foci of intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Expected postoperative changes with pneumocephalus and high-attenuation material, likely blood at the operative site.
CT Torso [**2163-1-3**]: CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: [**Hospital1 **]-apical paraseptal emphysema and scarring is present.
Multiple nodules are noted within the lung parenchyma, including 1-2 mm lesion within the right upper lobe (3:15), suspicious probable metastatic lesion within the right lower lobe measuring 6.5 x 7 mm (3:29) and 2.5-mm lesion within the left lower lobe (3:39).
Dependent linear and nodular atelectasis is noted.
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
No pathologically enlarged central or axillary lymph nodes are present.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST AND WITH ORAL CONTRAST: The liver, gallbladder, spleen, stomach, small bowel, pancreas, kidneys, and right adrenal gland are unremarkable.
A 12 x 13 mm left adrenal lesion is noted which displays Hounsfield attenuation values of [**8-20**] on the un-enhanced images, suggestive of an adenoma.
No pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph nodes are present.
Atherosclerotic disease is present within the intra-abdominal aorta.
A suspicious enhancing soft tissue focus is noted within the left gluteal subcutaneous fat immediately abutting the adjacent gluteal musculature measuring 8 x 15 mm (3:80).
BONE WINDOWS: No malignant-appearing osseous lesions are noted.
Mild degenerative changes are present within the spine with probable rudimentary ribs noted to project off L1.
Probable metastatic disease within the right lower lobe and left gluteal subcutaneous tissues as detailed above.
Additional smaller pulmonary nodules are noted, also suspicious for metastatic foci.
Enhancing left adrenal nodule meets criteria for a benign adenoma by Hounsfield values on the unenhanced examination.
Incompetent/refluxing dilated left gonodal vein.
This is often seen in the setting of pelvic congestion syndrome but needs correlation with exam/patient symptoms.
In addition, mild effacement of the suprasellar cistern and dilation of the temporal horns concerning for hydrocephalus.
Ventriculostomy catheter from the left burr hole frontal approach terminates just right of midline, but it has decompressed the ventricular system, but no evidence of continued hydrocephalus.
Interval slight increase in degree of postoperative blood in right frontal lobe; otherwise, other sites of hemorrhage are stable.
Brief Hospital Course: 51 yo female admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after onset of a severe headache and slurred speech.
EMS to OSH with progressive neurologic decline requiring intubation.
Ct showed large right frontoparietal hemorrhage with extension into right lateral ventricle with casting into 3rd and 4th.
Pathology was able to review the blood clot for pathology and identified melanoma cells.
On [**1-3**] post-operative MRI was done which revealed 4 other lesions in the brain.
On [**1-18**] she remained afebrile and neurologically stable and was discharged home with services.
Pathology findings were finalized on [**1-10**] and confirmed metastic melanoma as the histology.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.

?Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
?Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
?Your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 7 days.
