Intrahepatic biliary ducts are not dilated.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of biliary obstruction.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2162-11-30**] 3:21 PM IMPRESSION: Worsening pneumonia in the left lung, now involving the basal segments of the left lower lobe.
Apparent increase in right lower lung opacity which may reflect pneumonia.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, possibly increased on the left.
Diffuse bony changes compatible with known multiple myeloma.
Worsening of left lower lobe pneumonia especially superior segment.
Small effusions/atelectasis unchanged.
No evidence of acute infarct, mass effect, or hydrocephalus.
No enhancing brain lesions.
Multiple calvarial lesions consistent with patient's history of multiple myeloma.
New extensive opacification of bilateral mastoid air cells and middle ears.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 62 year old male with a pmh of Multiple Myeloma with multiple therapies and auto and allo tx s/p dli x4 most recently in [**Month (only) 216**], now with GVHD of the liver and skin.
He was being managed as an outpatient, but appeared to have eye involvement and skin involvement.
A RUQ ultrasound was done and showed no evidence of thrombosis or obstruction.
It was thought to be in the setting of absorption issues with active GVHD.
Hepatology was consulted in the setting of his acutely elevated bilirubin (peak 29.0 on [**11-23**]) without response to IV steroids, MMF, and CSA.
However, it continued to remain elevated in the mid to high 20s.
At that point he had a fever and was diagnosed with a left lower lobe pneumonia.
He was found to have a pneumonia on chest x-ray (see below).
# Multifactorial Metabolic Encephalopathy: Overnight from [**Date range (1) **], Mr. [**Known lastname **] became acutely confused, and began having hallucinations, confusion, word finding difficulty with severe asterixis.
Possible etiologies of his encephalopathy were CSA toxicity (peak level of 388 at the time of his change in MS) hepatic encephalopathy, polypharmacy, infection, and worsening primary disease (myeloma).
His infection was being treated with cefepime (which switched to meropenem on [**11-30**]) vancomycin and micafungin, which was changed to ambisome on [**12-1**].
He had an LP done on [**11-28**] which had elevated protein, but no white or red cells.
# Pneumonia: On [**11-22**] Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 28316**] a fever, and a chest x-ray revealed a new left lower mid lung field pneumonia.
A CT scan was done and showed a superior left lower lobe pneumonia.
He underwent bronchoscopy to evaluate for fungal pneumonia.
His galactomanan came back negative from his BAL, and his beta-glucan could not be interpreted because of his bilirubin level.
He had a repeat chest CT scan on [**11-26**] because of his change in mental status, and it showed an interval increase in size of his left lower lobe pneumonia.
On [**11-30**] he went into a-fib with RVR, and a chest x-ray was checked to evaluate for fluid overload as possible cause of his RVR.
The chest x-ray showed a worsening of his pneumonia.
His initial bronchoscopy had abnormal plasma cells reported.
# A-Fib with RVR: He does not have any history of atrial fibrillation, and on [**11-30**] he was noted to be tachycardic to 113, and irregular.
5mg IV metoprolol x 3 was given with no effect.
He became hypotensive to 95/60 transiently.
# Multiple Myeloma: Status post DLI #4.
His imuunoglobulin levels were all low, and his disease was thought to have been under good control.
Ultimately it was held in the setting of his liver dysfunction.
#  Pain: Pain from his multiple myeloma was controlled on Oxycontin 30mg [**Hospital1 **] and oxydcodone for breakthrough pain, which was his home regimen.
He was tapered off of his oxycontin and was not requiring any pain medication as his pain level was zero.
He was given stool softeners for constipation.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course  Patient presented with atrial fibrillation with RVR not responsive to IV beta blockade.
Afib became rate controlled on this regimen with HR <100 consistently.
His mental status was significantly compromised, differential included cyclosporin toxicity and/or worsening hepatic encephalopathy secondary to GVHD.
Despite continuation of broad spectrum antibiotics for his worsening bilateral mulitfocal pneumonia, he developed worsening hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated.
His beta 2 microglobulin levels were high, but no plasma cells were seen on BAL.
He became pancytopenic and neutropenic after intubation and was started on neupogen and received several transfusions of platelets.
