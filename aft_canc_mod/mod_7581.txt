ACTIVE PROBLEMS  # Pain control/nausea/anxiety/agitation/palliation - Patient with chronic abdominal pain, acutely worsened with cholangitis.
She has a significant narcotic requirement, and palliative care was consulted to provide guidance with narcotic use.
Patient had difficult to control nausea and emesis.
Later she was transitioned to thorazine for nausea with the intent of providing relief from nausea and also for sedation as patient was very agitated and restless.
She received ativan for sedation with paradoxical agitation.
She remained delerious likely secondary to pain and steroids.
Patient and her son/health care proxy [**Name (NI) 333**] both expressed wishes that she receive palliative sedation as she was restless and intermittently agitated on multiple regimens.
As all other palliative measures had been exhausted, it was felt that palliateive sedation was the most appropriate and medically necessary treatment.
#) Cholangitis:  Patient presented from LTAC with increased RUQ pain, fever, and rising T.Bili givng concern for cholangitis.
PTBD drain was placed on [**11-7**] with initial resolution of fevers and T. Bili began to downtrend.
Of note, cholangiogram during procedure revealed high grade obstruction of the distal CBD.
On the morning of [**11-9**] she re-developed fever and blood pressures began to drop to 90'/50's initially unresponsive to IVF bolus on the floor necessitating transfer to the MICU.
Fevers and hypotension resolved and patient was transferred back to the floor on [**11-11**].
Microbiology cultures of blood, urine, and bile were notable for ampicillin-resistant enterococcus sensitive to vancomycin.
#) Nutrition: Patient was chronically malnourished with 30 lb recent weight loss, and has been on tube feeds and TPN concurrently prior to admission.
TF's were initially held as to not exacerbate abdominal pain and TPN was continued.
Upon reinstitution of TF's, there was concern for malfuction of J-tube due to apparent leakage.
#) Right hydronephrosis: Has evidence of ureteralpelvic junction obstruction on MRCP.
CHRONIC PROBLEMS #) Gastric adenocarcinoma s/p surgical resection: Originally diagnosed after subtotal gastrectomy with roux-en-y ansatomosis on [**8-/2107**] for presumed gastric outlet obstruction.
Patient did not receive additional treatment due to complicated post-operative involving severe pain, nausea and malnutrition.
Patient was deemed to be a poor candidate for chemotherapy, palliative or otherwise.
Stable and no signs of active bleed.
