Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 89886**] Admission Date: [**2116-6-22**] Discharge Date: [**2116-6-26**] Date of Birth: [**2061-12-15**] Sex: M Service: OME   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 54-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, admitted today to begin cycle 2 week 2 high-dose IL-2 therapy.
He presented with microscopic hematuria with workup revealing a right renal mass.
He had a recurrence on the skin of his left face in [**2112-12-16**], which on excisional biopsy showed clear cell neoplasm most consistent with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
He was followed with surveillance imaging and on CT on [**2116-1-14**], torso revealed liver lesions consistent with metastatic disease.
Follow-up CTs revealed disease regression in the hepatic and right adrenal mets, and he was admitted for cycle 2 week 1 of therapy on [**2116-6-8**].
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Metastatic kidney cancer as above, hypertension, anxiety, depression, hypothyroidism after IL-2.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Well-appearing male in no acute distress.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema.
During this week he received 5 of 14 doses with therapy stopped early due to development of shock attributed to capillary leak syndrome from IL-2 therapy.
He was initially hypotensive on treatment day #2 without response to fluid boluses and was subsequently placed on dopamine 6 mcg per kilogram per minute with Neo-Synephrine added secondary to persistent hypotension.
He subsequently developed significant hypotension unresponsive to maximum dose Neo-Synephrine and dopamine, requiring the addition of Levophed, and was transferred to the ICU for further hemodynamic monitoring.
Source of shock was felt to be hypovolemia related to capillary leak from IL-2 therapy.
He returned to 11 Riceman on [**2116-6-25**] and further IL-2 was discontinued given the severity of side effects noted.
Other side effects during this week included nausea and vomiting improved with antiemetic therapy; rigors improved with Demerol and significant fatigue.
During this week he developed acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of 3.5 with associated oliguria and metabolic acidosis improved with bicarbonate replacement intravenously.
IV fluids were maintained given acute renal failure in the setting of hypotension.
During this week he had no transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia, myocarditis, coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia noted.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Metastatic renal cell carcinoma status post cycle 2 week 2 high-dose IL-2 therapy complicated by shock and acute renal failure.
