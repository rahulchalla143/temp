He required intubation and displayed septic physiology with hypotension, abnormal cultures ultimately grew E. coli and Klebsiella.
The source was felt to be urinary, however, the patient also had Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus in his sputum along with copious thick secretion.
He was treated initially with Vancomycin, Ceftazidime and Levofloxacin and later switched to Oxacillin and Levofloxacin when sensitivities revealed that his organisms were sensitive to these medications.
Following this, he had been slow to interact with others and displayed continued inability to take oral feedings and medications due to his sedation.
Concern was raised for another septic episode given hypernatremia as well as rising creatinine and hypotension and mild fevers.
As discussed initially, a septic picture was considered and the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, however, a Foley catheter was placed and the patient exhibited a large post obstructive diuresis.
He had no further rises in creatinine throughout the remainder of his hospital course.
However, on [**6-4**], the patient spiked a temperature to 102.0 F.  Cultures were sent by Venipuncture and off of his central line.
The patient also had yeast growing in his urine, which they recommended not to be treated by the Infectious Disease Service.
Surveillance cultures were checked and remained mainly negative with the exception of one set of blood cultures taken off of the patient's central line which grew Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative, felt to be a contaminant, given no other blood cultures grew this.
The patient remained afebrile throughout the remainder of the course of the hospitalization.
Cardiovascular:  The patient had tachycardia which was treated off and on with Lopressor.
This was occasionally held given concerns for hypotension and at this time is off Lopressor.
Pulmonary:  The patient had worsening O2 needs and developed tachypnea on [**2192-6-5**].
An arterial blood gas was consistent with respiratory alkalosis and chest x-ray was negative.
A VQ scan was obtained which revealed a pulmonary embolism.
Although the study was poor, the patient was felt to be high probability for pulmonary embolism and he was treated with heparin.
It was also known that he had a thrombus in the right internal jugular from an old central line which could also be the source of his embolus.
Hypoxia resolved, and at the time of this dictation, he is on room air with no oxygen needs.
Coumadin was not started because of fluctuating nutritional status.
Endocrine:  Although he had no prior history of diabetes mellitus, the patient was noted to be hyperglycemic while on TPN and was managed with a regular insulin sliding scale, and insulin in his TPN.
Gastrointestinal:  On rounds on [**2192-6-6**], the patient was found to be distended and tympanitic.
An abdominal x-ray was obtained which revealed a partial small bowel obstruction versus ileus.
Repeat abdominal x-ray showed resolution of his small bowel obstruction/ileus.
Ultimately, the patient became hyponatremic and required further TPN adjustments.
At the time of this dictation, his hyponatremia and hypernatremia are both controlled and he has normal natremic and continues to receive TPN.
The patient was not started on enteral feedings given his profound delirium and ileus problems.
Abdominal ultrasound:  Which revealed a simple cyst in the liver and a small amount of pleural effusion on the right (please see full report).
CT scan of the neck on [**2192-6-5**]:  Revealed a filling defect in the right internal jugular vein consistent with non-occlusive thrombus and a left subclavian line which was felt to be coiled upon itself.
CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis on [**2192-5-19**]:  Full transit of oral contrast through the GI tract; not unchanged from the [**5-18**] CT scan of the abdomen which revealed no evidence for pulmonary embolism in the main pulmonary arteries and intussusception and small bowel obstruction.
Aortic leaflets three and mildly thickened, or at least mild aortic regurgitation, mitral leaflets mildly thickened.
There is at last mild mitral regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary hypertension and no pericardial effusion.
Colon cancer status post right hemicolectomy.
Pulmonary embolus.
Obstructive uropathy.
Diabetes mellitus.
