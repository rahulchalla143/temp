He could hardly walk due to the pain and pain is more when he walks around otherwise while sitting there is minimal pain.
He was in his usual normal state of health until [**Month (only) **] when he started to have right lower abdominal pain and right flank pain for which he seeked his doctor, percocet was prescribed however it worsened.
For this, he had an abdominal US and CT abd/pelvis at [**Hospital1 2177**], and according to the patient, there was a mass in the urinary baldder and a cyst in his right kidney.
Also, the patient mentioned that he has a new onset hypertension that started about 3-4months ago for which he is on anti-hypertensive.
In the last 2-3 weeks, he also noted bilateral scrotal painless swelling but no lower limb swelling bilaterally until wed. when he started to have swelling and pain in his right thigh.
No fever or chill or sick contact.
2 years ago he had a left sided abd pain, for which he also had a CXR that showed 3.5cm mass in his left lung.
He also mentioned shortness of breath on exertion and dry cough for the last 3 months.
No associated chest pain or dizziness or sweating or palpitations.
He uses valid-date puffer occasionally within the last few months with minimal relief.
He also described some lower chest tightness, a few times post-meal, and not with his SOB.
LENI showed nonocclusive DVT of the right distal SFV.
He developed new oxygen requirement in the ED.
CXR showed RML opacity obscuring right heart border.
On the floor, reports shortness of breath with minimal exertion.

[**2137-2-19**]: Pleural fluid: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, Consistent with poorly differentiated carcinoma.
[**2137-2-19**]: Bladder mass biopsy: A. Bladder, left lateral dome, deep biopsy: - Invasive high grade papillary urothelial carcinoma, extensively invading lamina propria.
No definitive muscularis propria seen.
B. Bladder tumor, dome, biopsy: - High grade papillary urothelial carcinoma, suspicious for lamina propria invasion.
No muscularis propria seen.
Doppler: Non-occlusive thrombosis of the right distal superficial femoral vein.
[**2137-2-16**]: CT head without contrast: No overt intarcranial pathology  [**2137-2-17**]: CT Chest w/o contrast: 1.
Numerous multifocal pulmonary nodules several of which have a central solid component and peripheral ground glass component.
Overall, the appearances are highly concerning for multifocal metastatic disease.
Abnormal soft tissue seen in the mediastinum posterior to the esophagus and in the superior paraaortic retroperitoneum consistent with lymphadenopathy.
In addition, there is a large soft tissue mass in the left supraclavicular region, likely a metastasis.
Bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right.
Possible solid components seen bilaterally as described.
3.2-cm likely fat-containing mass at the left base consistent with a hamartoma.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
[**2137-2-20**]: ECHO: BED-SIDE: Mildly dilated right ventricle with free wall hypokinesis, severe pulmonary hypertension, and abnormal septal movement consistent with acute right ventricular pressure overload.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2-18**]/201, the severity of pulmonary hypertension has increased.
Right ventricle is now mildly dilated and mildly hypokinetic.
Doppler: No evidence of left upper extremity DVT  [**2137-2-25**]: CT Abd/Pelvis: 1.
No CT evidence for bladder leak in this somewhat limited examination secondary to lack of ability to distend the bladder with contrast.
Extensive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy concerning for metastatic disease.
Multiple pulmonary irregular opacities at the lung bases, incompletely imaged, concerning for metastatic disease.
Evidence for volume overload, including anasarca and bilateral moderate pleural effusions.
[**2137-2-26**]: CYSTOGRAM: No evidence of vesicoureteral reflux  [**2137-2-28**]: Duplex/Doppler US Abd?pelvis: 1.
Inferior vena cava thrombosis extending at least from the infrahepatic inferior vena cava to the level of the IVC filter.
Pleural effusion on the right.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo M, with recent bladder mass & renal cyst, hypertension, scrotal bilateral swelling, SOB on exertion and new hemoptysis presented with swollen painful Rt thigh and was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
# DVT/PE: LENI on admission showed SFV non-occlusive DVT.
Given the patient has bladder cancer, most likely with metastatic pleural effusion, he was at high risk for hypercoagulation and DVT.
The day following cystoscopy his renal function deteriorated (Cr up to 5.3) and he decompensated with hypotension and hypoexemia despite being on O2.
Bedside Echo showed severe pulmonary hypertension, which was new compared to the Echo he had 2 days prior to this event.
He was transferred to the Medical ICU, where he received total of 3 units of PRBC (had a few episodes of coffee ground vomitus) and Heparin drip was held.
Doppler US abd/pelvis on [**2137-2-28**] showed Inferior vena cava thrombosis extending at least from the infrahepatic inferior vena cava to the level of the IVC filter.
# HYPOXIA: Most likely was due to PE given his DVT and possible hypercoag state due to bladder cancer.Another conern was that the Rt pleural effusion that could be causing compression atelectasis.
Thoracocentesis was done on [**2137-2-18**] and 1.2L bloody effusion was aspirated.
Repeat CXR showed increasing small right-sided pleural effusion.
Pt transferred to the MICU on [**2137-2-20**] for episode of hypotension, hypoxia, and with signs of RV strain on TTE.
Had been off heparin drip for nearly 24 hours the day before for cystoscopy, which could have allowed PE to progress or for second PE to occur.
He was a poor candidate for lysis as he had hematuria from bladder mass as well as bloody pleural effusion.
Diagnosis of PE not formally made on CTA (poor renal function) or V/Q scan (pulmonary nodules).
Heparin drip was empirically restarted but was held due to coffee ground emesis in the ICU, then restarted and transferred back to medical floor after he became stable.
#TACHYCARDIA: Most likely it was due to PE due to DVT in distal SFV.
Bedside echo (after the pt's BP dropped to 70's/50's and sat down to 89-90% on [**2137-2-20**]) showed new onset severe pulm HTN and new Right ventr.
regional hypokinesia and mild dilatation, suggesting RV strain and concern of PE.
# BLADDER/RENAL lesion: Found to have bladder exophytic polypid lesion on CT abd/pelvis at [**Hospital6 **] [**2136-12-10**].
CT urography at [**Hospital1 2177**] [**2136-12-10**] showed retroperitoneal conglumerate LN (per report: nonspecific - lymphoma,granulomatous, mets).
CT chest w/o contrast showed 1.numerous multifocal pulmonary nodules 2.Abnormal soft tissue seen in the mediastinum posterior to the esophagus and in the superior paraaortic retroperitoneum consistent with lymphadenopathy.
2.large soft tissue mass in the left supraclavicular region, likely a metastasis.
Bladder mass pathology showed high grade papillary urothelial carcinoma, invasive and poorly differentiated.
He continued to have bloody urine post cystoscopy despite continuous bladder irrigation.
Cystogram showed no reflux or bladder leak.
Palliative chemotherapy was limited due to his poor kidney function.
Palliative radiotherapy was not favored by the patient due to possible irritative bladder and rectal side effects.
no hydronephrosis or obstruction was seen on the US.
He might have had an intra-op hypotension, giving acute renal injury, possibly ATN.
# Leukocytosis: Possibly secondary to stress induced (operation).
Pt remained afebrile with no signs of localized infection.
# hypertension:  possibly secondary to renal failure.
No antihypertensive meds given while hospitalized due to concern that tachycardia could be due to compensatory mechanism for a possible PE.
# scrotal bilateral painless swelling:  Concern for compression on IVC from possible malignancy.
Scrotal US at [**Hospital1 2177**] (done mid [**Month (only) **] [**2136**]) showed bilateral hydroceles.
# NORMOCYTIC ANEMIA: Hematuria due to bladder cancer, cystoscopy and biopsy, and was on heparin drip.
Also, bloody pleural aspirate.
In addition, he had coffee-ground vomitus in the ICU.
# Mr [**Known lastname 89666**] sadly passed away on [**2137-3-3**].
