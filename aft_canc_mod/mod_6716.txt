HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 72-year- old male with a past medical history notable for coronary artery disease status post PCI in [**2119**], with ongoing chronic angina, Hep-C viral infection without infection of chronic liver disease, gastrointestinal bleed with ulceration complicated by perforation in [**2106**], hypertension, recent urinary tract infection s/p cipro x 10 days, and background history of both emphysema and probable pulmonary fibrosis / IPF.
He was initially triaged from MCI [**Location (un) 912**] to [**Hospital **] Hospital Emergency Room, and following initial evaluation there was subsequently transferred to the emergency room at [**Hospital1 **] Hospital with a concern for possible small bowel obstruction, as well as ongoing evidence of GI bleed.
This revealed a long segment of colitis extending from the hepatic flexure to the rectosigmoid junction, consistent with infectious or inflammatory colitis.
Incidental note was made of fibrosis in bilateral lower lobes of his lungs.
There was no evidence of bowel obstruction.
Based on his presentation, he was treated with IV fluids, antibiotics, IV proton pump inhibition, and Dilaudid for abdominal pain, and subsequently admitted to the medical intensive care unit.
Coronary artery disease status post PCI in [**2119**], with ongoing chronic angina 2.
Hep-C viral infection without infection of chronic liver disease 3.
Hypertension 5.
Recent urinary tract infection s/p cipro x 10 days 6.
Long term smoking c/b both emphysema and probable pulmonary fibrosis / IPF.
FAMILY HISTORY:  His family history was notable for coronary artery disease, but he had no history of inflammatory bowel disease, or pulmonary disease.
ALLERGIES:  The patient was noted to have an allergy to sulfa drugs which reportedly caused seizures.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on presentation to the ICU revealed vital signs as noted above.
He was noted to be a rather frail man with poor dentition, but in no apparent respiratory distress.
He did complain of mild pain in his left lower quadrant.
His neck veins were flat and he had no evidence of lymphadenopathy.
Examination of his chest revealed fine crackles at both bases.
His abdomen was soft but diffusely tender to palpation, particularly in the left lower quadrant.
He had no evidence of guarding or rebound.
He had no peripheral edema, clubbing, or evidence of deep venous thrombosis.
His alkaline phosphatase was mildly elevated at 126, the remainder of his LFTs were within normal limits.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITALIZATION COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted with a diagnosis of a GI bleed.
In consultation with GI and Surgery, this was managed conservatively with antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and further examination for possible C. difficile infection or ongoing bowel ischemia, which was felt to be less likely.
He did not require transfusion and did not require colonoscopy or further invasive procedures to evaluate the course of his bleed, which resolved spontaneously.
On the evening of [**1-9**], the patient developed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response complicated by both the respiratory distress and hypertension, and was transferred back to the medical intensive care unit on [**1-9**].
The results of this included identification of both respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in his sputum, as well as gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters in his sputum.
An echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular cardiac function, mild mitral regurgitation and mildly elevated pulmonary arterial pressures.
Paracentesis on [**1-13**] was negative for any evidence of infection; his ascites was likely due to a combination of fluid overload in the setting of progressive right heart failure and underlying liver disease from hepatic congestion and HCV.
Given rising oxygen requirement over the course of [**1-9**]-26, a CT scan of the chest was obtained.
This was remarkable for evidence of not only emphysema and COPD, but also interstitial lung disease.
On further questioning, the patient reported that he did carry a diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis, but it was unclear what further workup had been obtained in the management of this disorder over the prior several years.
The patient developed further respiratory impairment, and after discussing the risks and benefits of steroid therapy in the setting of his GI bleed and ongoing infection with consulting services and with the patient, the decision was made to initiate steroid therapy to treat a component of accelerated idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
Despite this, the patient developed progressive respiratory insufficiency.
In consultation with myself, the patient, and the social worker, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 18741**], it was decided that the patient did not desire aggressive therapy for his progressive respiratory insufficiency.
The natural history of accelerated IPF was explained in detail, including the lack of curative therapy for progressive disease.
The role of experimental protocols in the management of IPF was also discussed, but his severe disease and his status as a vulnerable subject (prisoner) preculded enrollment in any such study.
We further discussed the patient's desire for aggressive therapy given the poor prognosis associated with the underlying process.
After consideration of the associated risks and benefits, he decided to continue therapy with supplemental oxygen, steroids, and antibiotics as well as medicines for pain and dyspnea.
He specifically did not want therapies including intubation, mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, placement of a feeding tube, or chronic mechanical ventilation.
In the event of a cardiopulmonary arrest, the patient did not want aggressive resuscitation including specifically chest compressions or CPR.
He was able to understand the risks and benefits associated with these therapies, and elected to pursue a conservative course of management going forward.
Over the next several days, the patient developed progressive respiratory insufficiency.
Accelerated idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis complicated by     respiratory failure.
Gastrointestinal bleeding, likely due to infectious or     inflammatory colitis.
Atrial fibrillation complicated by rapid ventricular     response.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Coronary artery disease.
Hepatitis C viral infection without evidence of chronic     liver disease.
