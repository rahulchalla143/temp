Admission Date:  [**2127-4-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-4-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2048-3-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5755**] Chief Complaint: fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: 79M with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma s/p metal biliary stent placement [**11-8**], who presents with fever x 1 day following repeat ERCP.
Pt is a very poor historian, so most of the history is obtained through chart review and ED providers.
The patient stated that he had the ERCP done, returned home, felt really fatigued and unable to walk ([**3-7**] leg pain and weakness).
Denied any chest pain, abd pain, nausea, vomiting.
No LOC, no h/o syncope.
Patient had second, outpatient ERCP by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] the day prior to admission due to increasing pruritis and a CT at [**Hospital1 **] that suggesting tumor ingrowth into the stent.
Occulsion cholangiograqm revealed extensive stricturing of both left and right intrahepatic ducts.
Although a small left intrahepatic radical opacified, it was not possible to advance the balloon catheter in this direction.
Even after multiple sweeps, there was some filling defect left in the upperprotion of the stent, consistent with a degree of tumor ingrowth.
Sticture not amenable to ERCP, and suggested PTCA as next intervention if futher obstructive symptoms occur.
Today pt presents with fever to 103.8, no [**Last Name (un) 103**] pain.
no nausea/no vomiting.
wcc is 20. pt was pancultured and started on levo and flagyl per ercp fellow who review pt in am for consideration of ir guided drainage if abscess present.
Apparently had an episode of unresponsiveness in the ED + incontinence.
No nausea/vomting reported.
No abdominal pain.
Pt was schdeduled to go to the regular floor but at 2305; pt was found to be unresponsive, diaphoretic and incontinent of stool.
Per nsg report, got up to go to the bathroom, felt off, ?
syncopal event; got back into bed, was found by nurse to be unresponsive and was incontinent of stool.
Of note, but had a recent 40-50lbs weight loss over last year.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient's complaint was fatigue and leg pain.
No abdominal pain, no nausea, no vomiting.
2) Glucose intolerance 3) CAD, s/p old inferior MI, s/p cath [**2121**] demonstrating 60% LCx lesion, no intervention .
Family History: [**Name (NI) **] father died of heart disease at age 88.
no thyromegaly.
no scleral icterus appreciated.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated.
soft, non-tender, non-distended, no organomegaly appreciated.
no RUQ tenderness EXT: WWP, good palpable pulses.
For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.
EKG: Sinus rhythm with atrial sensing and ventricular pacing.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There are mild dependent changes at the lung bases.
Moderate intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is noted.
Near the porta hepatis and adjacent to the proximal end of the biliary stent is an approximately 5.7 x 3.7-cm area of hypodensity of the hepatic parenchyma with ill-defined borders.
There is associated moderate intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
There is no defined fluid collection and no subcapsular or perihepatic fluid.
There is no ascites or intraperitoneal focal fluid collection or abscess.
At the upper pole of the right kidney is a 3.1-cm exophytic lesion which measures 28 Hounsfield units, higher than expected for a simple cyst.
There are bilateral extrarenal pelves.
There is no pathologic mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
The prostate is mildly enlarged.
There is no free pelvic fluid or lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious osteoblastic or osteolytic lesions are identified.
5.7 x 3.7 cm region of low attenuation of the hepatic parenchyma near the porta hepatis with ill-defined borders and multiple smaller satellite hypodense foci.
These findings are thought more likely to represent primary cholangiocarcinoma with intrahepatic metastases.
Evaluation with ultrasound could be helpful to determine if there is a fluid component.
If so, this could be aspirated for diagnostic purposes.
Bilateral parapelvic renal cysts.
3.1-cm exophytic lesion of the right kidney measures greater density than expected for a simple cyst.
Ultrasound is suggested to determine if this is a cyst or possibly a solid lesion.
RUQ ULTRASOUND: FINDINGS: There is mild edema within the gallbladder wall which may be seen with liver disease.
The gallbladder is relaxed and no pericholecystic fluid is identified to suggest cholecystitis.
As noted on prior CT, there is intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
No fluid collections around the liver or gallbladder are identified.
No fluid collections identified in or around the liver or gallbladder.
Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation also noted on CT one day previous.
Edema within the gallbladder wall which may be seen with liver disease.
No evidence of acute cholecystitis identified.
No edema or pleural effusion.
Fullness in the mediastinum at the thoracic inlet to the right of midline could be due to goiter or tortuous head and neck vessels.
Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads in standard placements.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
HEAD CT W/O CONTRAST: FINDINGS: No definite evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
Several areas of relative [**Name (NI) 33214**] is seen within vessels, including the MCAs and vertebrals, possibly secondary to recent contrast administration.
Visualized paranasal sinuses appear normally aerated.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
MRI with diffusion-weighted images is more sensitive in the evaluation for acute ischemia/infarct and for vascular detail.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Gram negative septicemia due to cholangitis: Bacteremia may have been secondary to manipulation during ERCP.
RUQ ultrasound showed no evidence of cholecystitis.
VT noted but did not temporally correlate with patient's episode.
More likely this was due to transient hypotension in the setting of his sepsis.
He denied any chest pain.
Could consider restarting at follow-up but likely little benefit given overall prognosis and patient will continue to be at risk of recurrent transaminitis.
