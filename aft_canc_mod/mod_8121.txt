He had 4 episodes of diarrhea today and 2 episodes of vomiting.
He is having pain in midline of upper chest which is similar to prior pain.
Denies trauma, incontinence, limb flailing or tongue biting.
Today he also complains of shoulder pain.
In [**Month (only) 216**] had strep viridans bacteremia for which finished 1 month course of ceftriaxone.
Past Medical History: - Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma stage III: dx [**9-/2200**] - CAD - Mitral regurgitation: last echo [**2200-10-11**]: moderate/severe MVP - BPH - Strep Viridans bacteremia ([**9-/2200**] s/p 1 month course of ceftriaxone) - Extensive alcohol/tobacco use: no current use - Hx SIADH  PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Mr. [**Known lastname 112389**] initially presented to clinic on [**2200-9-10**], at which time he had five to seven months of pain in his throat and difficulty swallowing.
According to his report, he had an endoscopy there, but no biopsy.
Following my visit, he was hyponatremic and thus was admitted to the hospital for this and for workup of his new malignancy.
He underwent a CT neck on [**2200-9-10**], which showed some question of a mass-like lesion within the esophagus, but no neck abnormalities.
He underwent a CT torso on [**2200-9-11**], which showed proximal dilation of the esophagus with thickening of the esophagus distal to the level of the carina as well as some small pulmonary nodules.
He had a barium swallow on [**2200-9-12**], which showed a mid esophageal lesion concerning for esophageal carcinoma.
Biopsy of the esophageal mass revealed an invasive squamous cell carcinoma.
He underwent a PET scan on [**2200-9-23**], which showed high-level FDG avidity at the site of the biopsy-proven squamous cell carcinoma as well as scattered subcentimeter mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymph nodes limited FDG avidity with an SUV mass of 3.7.

No evidence of perforation or mediastinitis.
Slight increased atelectasis at the left base.
There is left pleural thickening vs less likely small pleural fluid, unchanged from [**2200-11-7**].
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Appearance of the lung parenchyma is constant, with known apical scars, left more than right.
Very subtle basal parenchymal changes documented on the CT examination from [**2200-11-16**] and likely reflecting the sequela of chronic aspiration are not clearly seen on the chest x-ray.
No evidence of abnormal fluid collection to suggest an abscess within the thorax, abdomen or pelvis.
Stable thoracic esophageal stent with distal esophageal fullness consistent with history of esophageal carcinoma.
No new lymph nodes.
Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulosis.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse suggested.
No definite masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve (there may be partial posterior leaflet flail), but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of moderate to severe ([**3-14**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2200-10-15**], no clear change.
If clinically indicated, a TEE is suggested to exclude endocardits and to better assess mitral/tricuspid anatomy and degrees of valve regurgitation.
HEAD/NECK: There is no abnormal FDG-avidity in the head or neck.
There is no cervical lymphadenopathy.
There is circumfrential FDG-avidity around the stent.
Additionally, there is a focus with slightly higher activity continguous with the lateral aspect of the esophagus with the SUV max of 6.87 (image 66).
Just distal to the stent, there is mild esophageal fullness and FDG-avidity with an SUV max of 4.58.
In comparison to the prior PET-CT, the SUV max of the esophageal lesion was 17.12.
Multiple sub-centimeter mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are present and not significantly changed from the prior exam.
A second right hilar node measures 5 mm with an SUV max of 3.65 (image 71).
There are no new FDG-avid lymph nodes.
Mild FDG-avidity in the right base with some ill-defined ground glass has an SUV max of 2.10 and is new from the prior exam.
No discrete nodule is identified.
Left apical pulmonary scarring is stable.
A punctate nodule in the right lung is stable (image 77).
Centrilobular emphysema is unchanged.
There is bibasilar atelectasis.
There is mild left pleural thickening with calcifications, unchanged.
ABDOMEN/PELVIS: There is no abnormal FDG-uptake in the abdomen or pelvis.
There is no abdominal, mesenteric or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
MUSCULOSKELETAL: There is no abnormal FDG-uptake in the bones or muscles.
Physiologic uptake is seen in the brain, myocardium, salivary glands, GI and  GU tracts, liver and spleen.
Alternatively, the FDG-activity could be related to inflammation around the stent.
Small focus of low-level FDG-activity at the right lung base is likely aspiration or inflammation.

He remained in the hospital for a prolonged period due to recurrent fevers without discovering a source and despite antibiotics.
He also had electrolyte abnormalities, notably hyponatremia that had to be monitored until we were comfortable it would remain stable.
He was deemed to not be a surgical candidate for his cancer by Thoracic Surgery Tumor board so was started on cycle 3 of chemotherapy.
Patient having persistent odynophagia and dysphagia limiting PO intake and resulting in weight loss.
His pain regimen was been titrated with standing oxycodone po, since his difficulty swallowing pills has prevented MSContin and his cachectic body habitus and intermittent fevers prevented fentanyl.
# Sepsis: Fevers, altered mental status, and hypotension required ICU admission on his presentation.
Patient has history of multiple organisms found on blood culture during last admission, but none were isolated on current admission.
Stable, dry cough with unchanged CXR making pulmonary source unlikely.
Recent echo showed possible tricuspid vegetation vs. leaflet thickening, but unable to have TEE due to esophageal mass.He was treated at various times during his long admission with vancomycin, meropenem, or zosyn.
He continued to have low-grade fever spikes through some antibiotics, so unclear whether infectious or due to tumor fever.
Final regimen chosen was vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**]/fluc on [**11-25**] without true fever since then.
Per ID no current evidence to suggest possible hidden source such as recurrent endocarditis or abscess.
Fever after failed PICC placement (see below) may have been due to hematoma inflammatory reaction.
# Failed Right PICC placement on [**12-5**]: In advance of planned discharge, during bedside PICC placement patient's artery was punctured and he developed a large hematoma in his right arm.
He went for IR guided PICC line in his left arm subsequently without complications.
# Hyponatremia: Secondary to SIADH.
Initially fluid-responsive, likely due to hypovolemia, but once euvolemic managed with salt tabs, free-water restriction with encouraged high electrolyte diet,and concentrated tube feeds with TwoCal HN.
# Likely Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood - Difficult to fully assess given translation issues, but patient now well-known to staff here and is understandably showing the above mentioned symptoms.
Patient also had depressed mood, poor appetite, loss of interest secondary to his situation.
# Diarrhea, chronic: Nonbloody with multiple negative C diff assays.
# Tachycardia, possibly related to tumor burden: Sinus per EKG [**11-3**] and [**11-15**], however old EKG with SVT and lack of p waves suggesting possible re-entrant arrythmia.
Started on low dose verapimil however had to be stopped due to hypotension.
He remained tachycardic and asymptomatic without intervention due to his generall tenuous status.
# G-tube site: Starting [**11-13**], skin site developed minor 2-3mm erythema, induration, and some thin white-yellow discharge.
No evidence of true cellulitis.
No e/o worsening on exam or imaging.
# Hypomagnesmia, likely secondary to cisplatin-induced renal wasting - With persistent repletions.
Family and patient to be cautioned about possible loose stool side effects.
CHRONIC ISSUES # BPH: No urinary issues off doxazosin, held earlier in the setting of hypotension Continued tamsulosin  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 1) Esophageal carcinoma: Further outpatient management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
