Later found to have right homonymous hemianopia, left arm drift as well.
CT was negative for hemorrhage.
CTA showed what appeared to be drop off signal of the basilar with minimal flow in bilateral PCAs.
Guaiac was trace positive pre t-PA. No change in exam after t-PA immediately.
Of note, at 11am, fluency and dysarthria are noted to be improved, as he raised his right arm off the bed without difficulty.
TEE in [**2-11**] shows complex atheroma in descending aorta.
A left-to-right shunt across a small secundum atrial septal defect was seen.
Central retinal artery occlusion R eye - [**10-10**] pt developed central retinal artery occlusion likely [**1-10**] embolic event.
Insulin Dependent Diabetes - has had for many years.
Has had multiple DM complications including L eye retinopathy, gastroparesis, peripheral neuropathy complicated by several bouts of LE cellulitis.
Question of possible nephrotic syndrome; may  be related to diabetes but unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) 167**] acoustic schwanoma - treated with gamma knife radiation at OSH.
Hypertension 11.
Right BKA [**2193-2-28**] due to PVD c/b e coli bacteremia and UTI with pseudomonas 12.  anemia - iron def and anemia of chronic inflammation 13.  chronic malnutrition and 2 months of diarrhea, on TPN, multiple GI ulcers, no lymphoma seen on biopsies, but still undergoing w/u 14.
B12 deficiency on IM replacement  Social History: The pt is married, with 2 kids.
GEN:  elderly man, anxious SKIN:  no rash HEENT:  NC/AT, anicteric sclera, dry mm NECK: supple, no carotid bruits CHEST:  normal respiratory pattern, CTA bilat anteriorly CV:  regular rate and rhythm without murmurs (difficult to fully appreciate right now) ABD:  softly distended, +BS, multiple bruises EXTREM:  right BKA, left edema 1+ to knee.
NEURO: via Russian translator Mental status:  Patient is alert, awake, mildly anxious.
Language is NONfluent with good comprehension for 2 step commands in Russian, repitition intact (albeit he wispers the words), + severe dysarthria for pa/ta/ka sounds.
Fundoscopic exam: discs flat, fundi clear, no hemorrhages or exudates.
+ left beating horizontal nystagmus in primary gaze and worse when looking to the left.
+ right pronator drift.
No adventitious movements.
Coordination: + dysmetria on finger-to-nose on the left, too weak to tell on the right.
Thrombosis of the distal basilar artery.
No definite evidence of infarct.
Acute left PICA territorial infarct involving the inferior aspect of the left cerebellar hemisphere.
No other diffusion abnormality identified.
Distal right vertebral artery irregularity and narrowing distal to the right PICA, likely relating to underlying atherosclerotic disease.
Relatively [**Name2 (NI) 15015**] right vertebral artery throughout its course that may be secondary to an origin stenosis.
CXR ([**2193-5-3**]): Lungs remain quite low with most pronounced atelectasis at the medial lung bases.
No pleural effusion.
There is also diminished flow signal intensities seen in the right vertebral artery compared to the left side.
There is narrowing of the distal right vertebral artery as seen on the previous CTA of [**2193-5-3**].
Basilar artery embolism was felt to be most likely secondary to right vertebral artery atherosclerotic disease.
He continued to have congruous incomplete homonymous hemianopia on the left and mild left-sided weakness.
Repeat MRI on hospital day three demonstrated small lesions in the distribution of the PCA bilaterally.
MRA of the neck was also performed at that time and was negative for dissection.
As he was judged to be a high risk for bleeding from intestinal ulcers (as discussed below), the decision was made to place the pt on anti-platelet [**Doctor Last Name 360**] as opposed to anticoagulation.
At the time of discharge, neurologic examination was notable for left congruous incomplete homonymous hemianopia, dysmetria (left>right), left sided weakness in an UMN pattern.
He had many guaiac positive stools.
This revealed mosaic appearance, erythema and erosion in the whole stomach; reticular, granularity and nodularity in the whole duodenum; ulcer in the first part of the duodenum; otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum.
As no clear evidence of source of bleeding was identified, push enteroscopy was performed on hospital day six and revealed friability, scalloping, atrophied villi in the jejunum (biopsy); ulcers in the proximal jejunum and mid jejunum (biopsy); nodularity and atrophy in the whole duodenum; mass in the distal bulb (biopsy); edematous, boggy mucosa and erosion in the antrum and stomach body.
He was judged to be at high risk for bleeding from the ulcers identified.
UTI: The pt was found to have a urinary tract infection as part of a fever work-up.
Of note, he suffers from hypoalbuminemia of unknown etiology.
As a result, he developed ascites and scrotal edema which began to gradually improve at the time of discharge with gentle diuresis.
Simethicone 80 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for abdominal pain/distention.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: -posterior circulation infarcts -blood loss anemia due to gastrointestinal bleed  Discharge Condition: Stable.
Neurologic examination notable for for left congruous incomplete homonymous hemianopia, dysmetria (left>right), mild (4+/5) left sided weakness in an UMN pattern.
If you experience increasing weakness, visual or speech difficulties or other concerning symptoms, please call your primary care doctor or return to the emergency department for evaluation.
