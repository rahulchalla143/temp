Admission Date:  [**2167-4-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2167-5-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2090-1-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9160**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal distension, hypoxia, acute renal failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Paracentesis Nasogastric tube placement  History of Present Illness: 77 y.o male with DM, CKD stage III, hypertension and CAD s/p stent who initially presented for an EUS with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and was found to be hypoxic with an O2 sat of 88% on RA.
The patient was recently admitted in [**Month (only) 958**] to [**Hospital6 4287**] for diverticulitis, where a CT of the abdomen demonstrated an incidental pancreatic mass.
Since then, he has had stable abdominal pain in the 4 weeks prior to his current presentation, as well as increasing abdominal distention.
He then developed shortness of breath as well as nausea and vomiting over the past several days.
Denies cough but had one episode of bloody in sputum recently.
No dysuria; no pain in calves or thighs; no blood in stool.
He denies recent intake of NSAIDs or other pain Rx other than APAP/codeine about a month ago for belly pain.
In the interim, he had also underwent a colonoscopy which showed diverticulitis but was negative for malignancy.
The patient's labs were notable for hyperkalemia to 5.8, gap metabolic acidosis with bicarbonate of 17, BUN of 137 and creatinine of 7.4  He was also noted to have a WBC count of 17.7.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p stent in early [**2154**]'s Hypertension DM Prostatic hypertrophy Diverticulitis Stage III CKD (b/l creatine 1.4-1.6) Pancreatic mass found on incidental CT scan in [**2167-2-12**]  Social History: Worked as electrical engineer.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL Neck: supple, JVP not elevated (is 6-7cm at 30 deg), no LAD CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: coarse breath sounds anteriorly, no wheezes.
bowel sounds not appreciated, no tenderness to palpation, no rebound or guarding.
Only trace edema pretibially.
Leftward precordial R wave transition point.
[**2167-4-29**] CXR: Bibasilar atelectasis and small left pleural effusion, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
Large volume ascites with extensive omental nodularity concerning for metastatic disease secondary to known pancreatic primary malignancy.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Small left pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis.
No hydronephrosis or renal abnormality to account for acute renal failure  [**2167-4-30**] Peritoneal Fluid cytology: *****  [**2167-4-30**] Abd U/S with dopplers: 1.
No evidence of thrombosis.
Somewhat flat hepatic venous waveforms which are non-specific.
Multiple hypoechoic nodules suspicious for metastases within a fatty liver.
[**2167-4-30**] LENIs: No evidence of clot in bilateral lower extremities with limited evaluation of the left sided calf veins.
[**2167-5-1**] V/Q scan: Low likelihood ratio for recent pulmonary embolism.
[**2167-5-1**] CXR: Low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.
No evidence of hydronephrosis, stones, or masses within the kidneys.
Gross patency of renal vasculature bilaterally.
However, bilateral high-resistance pattern of renal arterial waveforms, with no antegrade diastolic flow.
These findings may be seen with acute or chronic renal disease such as parenchymal diseases or ATN.
Brief Hospital Course: 77yo man with recent pancreatic mass seen on CT in [**2-23**], DM, CKD stage III, hypertension and CAD s/p stent who initially presented for an EUS with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and was found to be hypoxic with an O2 sat of 88% on RA, now with omental studding on CT, likely malignant ascites, and acute renal failure.
Ascitic fluid was sent for cytology on [**2167-4-30**], which was positive for malignant cells.
# Pancreatic mass/omental nodularity: Most likely metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
# Acute on chronic renal failure / Hyperkalemia: Admitted with Cr of 7.4, from baseline of about 1.3-1.4.
[**Month (only) 116**] have also be from hypoperfusion due to increased intraabdominal pressure from ascites, although his urine output did not improve much after paracentesis.
Nephrology was consulted and also did not recommend dialysis if his suspected malignancy was not going to be untreated.
# Hypoxia: Differential included pulmonary embolism (he had elevated d-dimer to 3678 and did have one isolated event of bloody sputum recently and likely underlying pancreatic malignancy), but no evidence of right heart strain or hemodynamic effects, and V/Q scan was low probability.
More likely, however, was poor ventilation due to abdominal distention and possible hydrothorax.
# Nausea: Likely [**1-15**] functional bowel obstruction given omental studding.
We placed an NG tube for decompression, which significantly improved the nausea.
Prior to planned discharge to hospice, he became agitated and more tachypneic.
Thus, he was kept in the hospital and treated with IV Dilaudid to treat his tachypnea and Zyprexa to treat acute agitation.
He developed increased secretions, which was managed with a Scopolamine patch.
