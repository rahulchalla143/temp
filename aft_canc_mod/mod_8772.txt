He noted large amt of blood in toilet bowl.
He had several episodes of bloody bm at home and he presented to ED.
An NG lavage was performed with 250 cc NS with yellow bilious return.
In the unit he underwent tagged RBC scan which showed bleeding in LLQ, however angio was negative.
On transfer pt does not have any complaints.
He has not had any large bloody BMs for >1 day now.
Mitral valve disease (bacterial endocarditis) s/p replacement with mechanical valve in '[**85**] 2.
Atrial fibrillation 3.
Hiatal hernia s/p repair 5.
GERD 6. s/p fatty tumor removal from stomach, s/p tonsilectomy 7. s/p TERP   Social History: Worked in the shipyards with lots of asbestos exposure, widowed, lives alone with family in the area, non-smoker, non-drinker   Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Tc 99.2 BP 120/60 HR 80 RR 16 O2sat 95%RA I/O (24 hr) 925/[**2189**] .
HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, OP clear, MMM Chest: faint bibasilar crackles otherwise CTAB CVR: irreg, irreg, +mitral click (mechanical valve) Abd: soft, nt, nd Ext: trace edema bilaterally to ankles.
Right groin with a small (lipoma vs hematoma) like mass near the angio catheter insertion site.
hct 26 -> 28 ->30.6 ([**9-15**] 7PM) INR 1.9 Tagged RBC scan [**9-14**] - Gastrointestinal bleeding in left lower quadrant .
No evidence of GI bleeding in the SMA or [**Female First Name (un) 899**] territory.
Spasm versus occluded branch of the left colic artery.
No signs of angiodysplasia or neovascularity.
Delayed blood pool images show no evidence of bleeding within the GI tract.
Colonoscopy: Severe diverticulosis.
No active bleeding.
EGD: normal mucosa, no active bleeding.
Virtual colonoscopy: no active bleeding.
Brief Hospital Course: 85 yom with a. fib, chf (ef 35%), MVR, gerd and on anticoagulation with coumadin at home admitted with BRBPR, thought to be bleeding diverticuli in the setting of anticoagulation.
#GI bleed: The patient had several episodes of bright red blood per rectum during his admission, and although his Hct did drop slightly, it remained stable at 28 and the patient was asymptomatic.
IR did not feel repeat angio was indicated given the negative tagged red cell scan.
Patient had no further epsiodes of BRBPR after [**9-16**].
Therefore, GI did colonoscopy and EGD and patient had subsequent virtual [**Last Name (un) **] secondary to poor prep (unable to visualize the cecum) which were negative for active bleeding but demonstrated severe diverticulosis.
We restarted heparin gtt secondary to MVR and afib, under very tight control with goal PTT between 40-80 and began to re-bridge to coumadin on [**9-17**].
# NSVT - On [**9-17**], the patient experienced a 15 run of VT. His electrolytes were normal, last echo [**11-29**] with EF 40%.
We continued to follow him on telemetry with no further events.
#MVR/ A. fib: Given mechanical valve and a.fib, pt at very high risk for thromboemblism if remains off anticoagulation.
Given his stable hct we restarted low dose heparin (goal PTT 60-80) without bolus.
