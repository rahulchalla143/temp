His post-transplant course has been complicated by an upper GI bleed with EGD demonstrating PUD, episode of Bell?????
The suspicion is for bone marrow involvement of his T cell lymphoma, but this has not been [**Location (un) **] out on bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry.
He was given Tylenol, 1L of NS over 2 hours, and blood cultures were obtained from peripheral site and PICC line.
Also sent UA, urine cultures, and will have chest xray.
Further investigation led to biopsy of small bowel and the diagnosis of T cell lymphoma was made.
Liver bx revealed non-specific inflammation consistent with acute hepatitis.
His father died of an unknown cardiac event at the age 34.
Mother, sister and grandmother have diabetes mellitus.

Moderate amount of free air in the abdomen, as described above.
There is abnormal thickening of small bowel loops with a moderate amount of free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis  PET ([**2119-1-11**]): INTERPRETATION: An FDG-avid right adrenal mass is identified measuring approximately 2.3 x 1.1 cm, with a maximal SUV value of 13.9.
In retrospect,this right adrenal lesion was seen on the prior CT scans dating back to [**2118-12-12**].
Additionally, there is mildly increased FDG activity demonstrated within the medial limb of the left adrenal gland with a small nodule seen measuring approximately 1.7 x 1.0 cm.
The maximal SUV value for this left adrenal lesion is 3.0.
Additionally, there has been interval development of new foci of abnormally increased FDG activity within the osseous structures including the right 1st rib, anterolateral portion of the right 2nd rib, posterior right 8th rib, posterior aspect of the right 10th rib, the left scapula, medial aspect of the left clavicle, and the T7 and L4 vertebral bodies.
Physiologic FDG uptake is seen in the myocardium, liver and gastrointestinal tract.
Brief Hospital Course: Admitted with neutropenic fever with no clear source.
He has a complicated past history of prolonged neutropenic fever, as well as unexplained pancytopenia.
His primary Oncologist has suspected recurrence of his T-cell lymphoma, but has been unable to conclude this based on several recent bone marrow biopsies.
PET scans showed activity in multiple sites including the axial skeleton, lungs, and bilateral adrenal glands.
CT-scan demonstrated bilateral enlargement of adrenal glands.
He continued to spike high fevers and had several episodes of hypotension, confusion, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia which were felt to be related to adrenal insufficiency from either lymphomatous infiltration of his adrenals of CMV adrenalitis.
He was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics including ganciclovir for presumptive treatement of CMV virmeia and high dose steroids.
Daptomycin was continued for his presumed Bartonella infection diagnosed earlier with a postivie IgM titer and granulomas on a prior bone marrow bx.
His fevers resolved with steroids and were attributed to recurrence of his lymphoma.
Biopsy of a right chest lesion demonstrated anaplastic transformation of his T cell lymphoma with markers similar to those in his prior bone marrows.
New skin lesions were observed.
Discussion was made to send him home on steroids and return for further treatment, however he developed acute abdominal pain, higher fevers, and peritonitis.
CT abdomen demonstrated free air in the peritoneum and focal thickenings in several areas of his small bowel.
In consultation with surgery, it was felt that exploratory laparotomy would have a near fatal outcome.
It is thought that his performation occured following tumor regression within his small bowel in the setting of chemotherapy and high dose steroids.
