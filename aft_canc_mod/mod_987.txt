Admission Date:  [**2120-7-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-7-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2078-2-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: MED  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**] Chief Complaint: Right flank pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 43 yo Italian male with 7 months hx of right flank pain for which he takes hydrocodone presents at work prior to admission with increased right flank pain, and ambulance was called and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
He had multiple ecchymosis on his body when initially seen at the ED.
But abdominal CT showed cirrhotic liver and 1.5 cm mass in the liver.
However pt was noted to have high LFT, thrombocytopenia, elevated lipase, increased EtOH level=419.
Past Medical History: Right flank pain Hx of depression since 3 yrs ago  Social History: Patient moved from [**Country 2559**] [**12-14**] yrs ago and had a successful cheese distributory business until [**10-12**] when his business went bankrupt.
Due to depression and high stress, he comes home and drink 2-3 bottles of wine/day.
Physical Exam: PE: T 99.6 BP 140/80 HR 84 RR 20 Gen-In bed, somewhat confused and agitated, tremulous HEENT-NC/AT, PERRL, anicteric sclera, EOMI Lungs-CTA bilaterall CV-RRR, nl S1, S2, no m/r/g Abd- soft, non-distended, right flank pain to palpation.
Left groin with 10x12cm echymosis but no erythema.
The appearance is consistent with fatty infiltration, though the heterogeneity raises the liklihood of a diffuse hepatic process such as cirrhosis.
In addition there is a 1.5 cm lesion with peripheral enhancement.
There is no suggestion of acute traumatic injury to any of the solid or hollow intraabdominal organs.
MRI ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There is diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver.
In the superior portion of segment 7, there is a 2.2 cm well-defined mass which is homogeneously hyperintense on T2-weighted images and hypointense on T1-weighted images.
There is peripheral puddling of contrast after administration of gadolinium.
These features are consistent with hemangioma.
No suspicious hepatic lesions are seen.
Slightly prominent nodes are seen in the porta hepatis.
2) Hepatic hemangioma.

Body, spine CT ruled out trauma, and patient became tremulous and neurlogy was called to evaluate.
Initially, pt was disoriented, agitated and showing bilateral intentional tremors.
His symptoms slowly resolved over 3 days requiring less Ativan, and was switched from Ativan to Valium 10 mg tid on day 4.
By day 5, he required no Valium overnight showing little tremor and improvement in coordination.
2)Liver mass/hepatitis/cirrhosis - Initial CT of abdomen done at SICU for trauma workup showed a small mass in the liver.
AFP was slightly elevated with 9.5, his intial liver enzymes were elevated (GGT 3740), and hepatitis panels were all negative.
MRI of abdomen showed fatty cirrhotic liver and 2.2 cm hepatic hemangioma.
Because of hx of alcohol abuse, he most likely has cirrhosis and hepatitis secondary to alcohol.
Pt needs to follow up with his PCP for his elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes.
3)R flank pain - Pt states he had this pain for 7 months.
Hx seems to be consistent with kidney stone given the exacerbation with urination.
CT showed no fracture or obvious musculoskeletal findings that could explain this pain.
Patient was seen by Hem/Onc on admission, and his thrombocytopenia is most likely secondary to alcohol induced marrow suppression and cirrhosis.
His thrombocytopenia explains the multiple eccymosis on his body.
6)Cardiovascular - Pt has no known CAD or HTN per history.
On admission, patient was tachycardic (Pulse>100)and hypertensive (systolic in 140's), but was believed to be secondary to alcohol [**Last Name (STitle) **].
However, even 3 days after admission when his withrawl symptom was improving requiring less benzodiazepine, his BP and pulse remained high.
7)Depression - Patient has a hx of depression 3 years ago after his wife left him.
Patient showing all signs of depression but not suicidal at this time.
Acute hepatitis 3.
Hepatic hemangioma 4.
Mild pancreatitis 5.
Thrombocytopenia 6.
Depression  Discharge Condition: Fair, stable  Discharge Instructions: Pt is instructed to take all of the listed medications as instructed.
