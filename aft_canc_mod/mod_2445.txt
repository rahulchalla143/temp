Admission Date:  [**2146-10-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-10-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2082-12-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Cefepime / Bactrim  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8810**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath, fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Chest tube placement  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 24735**] is a 63 y/o M with a history of AML s/p allo SCT [**10/2144**], chronic GVHD (liver, skin, ?lung) on prednisone and cyclosporine who presents from home with fever and worsening shortness of breath after bronchoscopy/biopsy on the day prior to admission.
He reports that there were no immediate complications following the procedure.
The next morning, the patient reports worsening dyspnea and the onset of fever.
Per ED report, the patient's wife also reports that he has had altered mental status on the day of admission.
Of note, the patient was recently seen by pulmonary in consultation for daily productive cough over at least five months.
He was prescribed moxifloxacin for ten days after a CT chest ([**2146-8-30**]) demonstrated mosaic ground-glass attenuation with bronchiectasis throughout and in left lower lobe a tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] pattern also notable for a lingular consolidation (pulmonary read).
There was also diffuse mosaic attenuation affecting small airway obstruction and the thought that this could be a transplant-related bronchiolitis obliterans.
The patient completed the moxifloxacin without change in his respiratory symptoms.
Exam significant for diffuse rhonchi throughout, alert and oriented to person place and month but easily distractible and answers questions slowly.
Chest x-ray revealed large left pneumothorax without mediastinal shift.
A 28 French chest tube was placed in the ED, and repeat chest x-ray showed lung re-expansion, with the chest tube curving inferiorly.
- initially treated with 7 and 3 (idarubicin and ARA-C, however,  day 14 marrow showed persistent blasts.
He was enrolled in the randomized trial of HiDAC with or without clofarabine and began  treatment on [**2144-4-27**].
This course was c/b fevers to 105, rashes,  LFTs 300s.
- [**2144-6-23**]: Bone marrow showed a mildly hypercellular erythroid  dominant bone marrow with no morphologic evidence of leukemia.
- [**2144-8-17**]: received single cycle Dacogen due to donor issues - [**2144-11-5**]: started reduced intensity conditioning with Fludarabine-Busulfan and ATG.
His post-transplant course was uncomplicated with the exception of a mild transaminitis.

Persistent patchy opacity of the left base and unchanged subcutaneous emphysema.
However, there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
In the interval since the prior study, there has been development of a very large left pneumothorax with collapse of the left lung.
There may be slight tension component.
No pleural effusion.
Since [**2146-4-20**], left lower lobe and lingular consoldation has resolved leaving behind brochiolitis and bronchiectasis, and previous multifocal bronchiolitis has minimally decreased.
Overall improvement in lung consolidation is probably resolving infection , but focal consolidation in inferior lingular segment is new and could be infectious or non-infectious organzing pneumonia.
Similarly, the multifocal bronchiolitis picture can be infectious or non-infectious, transplant-related, bronchiolitis obliterans.
Diffuse mosaic attenuation reflects small airway obstruction, a finding often seen with transplant-related, bronchiolitis obliterans  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 24735**] is a 63 y/o male with a history of AML s/p allo SCT [**10/2144**] (D+703), chronic GVHD (liver, skin, ?lung) on prednisone and cyclosporine who presented from home with fever to 102 and increasing shortness of breath after bronchoscopy/biopsy on the day prior to admission, found to have left pneumothorax and persistent LLL consolidation.
#.PNEUMOTHORAX: Patient had a bronchoscopy with biopsy on the day prior to admission which likely caused pneumothorax to develop.
Patient was weaned off of oxygen successfully and repeat chest x-rays continued to show no reaccumulation of pneumothorax.
#.LLL CONSOLIDATION: patient had fever and leukocytosis on admission, likely secondary to infectious vs. non-infectious organizing pneumonia.
Other possible cause was strep pneumo bacteremia, although less likely (see below).
Patient has h/o 3 episodes of pneumonia in early [**2145**].
Also has chronic cough since [**2146-3-20**], thought to be [**12-22**] GVHD versus organizing pneumonia.
Bronchoalveolar lavage on [**10-19**] showed moraxella catarrhalis and strep pneumoniae, strep sensitive to levoquin/PCN G/tetracycline/bactrim/vancomycin.
As patient reported history of achilles tendon swelling on Levoquin, as well as h/o diarrhea with penicillins and macrolides (augmentin and azithromycin are best agents for moraxella), he was switched to moxifloxacin 400mg PO BID to complete 2 week course.
White count and fever curve rapidly trended back to normal during hospitalization.
[**Month (only) 116**] have been secondary to disruption of pulmonary parenchyma during transbronchial biopsy, given pt's chronic immunosuppression putting him at greater risk for this issue.
Per above, patient treated with moxifloxacin rather than levoquin due to h/o achilles tendon swelling on levoquin.
Also developed EBV, which caused lymphoproliferative disease.
#.HYPONATREMIA: hypovolemic hyponatremia.
Disp:*11 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* 9. benzonatate 100 mg Capsule Sig: Two (2) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for cough.
Pneumonia  SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1.
Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) 2.
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia, in remission   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital with a punctured lung (pneumothorax) after having a bronchoscopy.
You were also found to have a pneumonia, which was treated with antibiotics.
ADDED albuterol nebulizer once every 6 hours as needed for wheezing or shortness of breath  Please see your doctor if you develop increased swelling or pain in your Achilles tendons while you are on Moxifloxacin, as this could be a side effect of the medication.
