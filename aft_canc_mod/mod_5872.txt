Her chest x-ray was consistent with pneumonia on the right side and mild volume overload.
The patient was persistently febrile with a cough and had new onset atrial fibrillation with hypoxic episodes.
There was concern regarding her relative immunosuppression and therefore, the patient was started on Bactrim treatment and was transferred to the MICU for management of hypoxia, possible intubation, and concern for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].
She continued to complain of sensation of shortness of breath, but denied any chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.
She was tachycardic, atrial fibrillation at 126-136 was her ventricular rate, blood pressure ranged from 95-111/48-55.
Pulmonary examination: Bronchial breath sounds with bibasilar crackles.
Her EKG showed sinus tachycardia with normal axis and intervals.
She had old T-wave inversions in V1 through V4, otherwise no evidence of acute ischemia.
Echocardiogram from the [**2-23**]:  Ejection fraction 60%, left atrial dilatation, [**12-22**]+ TR, no vegetations.
RADIOGRAPHIC DATA:  Showed pulmonary congestion with possible infiltrates.
CT of her abdomen from the [**3-4**] notable for ground-glass opacities at the lung bases, otherwise it was unremarkable.
Respiratory failure, pneumonia, and CHF:  The patient had persistent temperature spikes.
She was maintained on triple antibiotic regimen, however, persistently spiked and without any change in her chest x-ray or symptoms.
The patient had a history of oral herpetic lesions in the past and was started on acyclovir as well.
There is no evidence of active bleeding.
Change in mental status and fever:  CT of the head was performed to evaluate any evidence of an acute intracranial hemorrhage.
There was no evidence of that.
CTA was also performed to evaluate for any evidence of a pulmonary embolus given the patient's ongoing hypoxia.
In summary, given the patient's overall poor prognosis and ongoing hypoxia despite very broad coverage with antimicrobials, a family meeting confirmed the patient's code status DNR/DNI as well as pursuing comfort measures only.
On [**2158-11-11**], patient was sedated and reportedly unresponsive to verbal stimuli, and was persistently tachycardic.
CAUSE OF DEATH:  Respiratory distress secondary to pneumonia and myelodysplastic syndrome.
