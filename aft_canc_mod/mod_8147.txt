In the cath lab, the patient received IVC filter through right femoral [**First Name3 (LF) 5703**] with no complications.
On arrival to the floor, patient remained stable without complaints but was lethargic.

Mildly increased vasogenic edema compared to the prior examination.
BLE US in ED [**2179-8-3**] - Nonocclusive thrombus in the left popliteal [**Month/Day/Year 5703**].
CTA at OSH [**2179-8-3**] - large bilateral pleural effusions TTE [**2179-8-4**] - Mild right ventricular cavity dilation with free wall hypokinesis.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Normal left ventricular cavity size and regional/global systolic function.
Brief Hospital Course: 72M with 3-month h/o glioblastoma s/p radiation therapy and temozolomide (last dose on [**2179-7-22**]) presents with several days of shortness of breath and several weeks of fatigue/abulia, diagnosed as bilateral PE and L DVT.
Active: # PE: Patient initially present with SOB and fatigue and found to have bilateral PE by CTA at OSH.
Experienced transient hypotension in the ED with SBP to the 80s that was fluid responsive.
Not a candidate for thrombolysis or clot retrieval given glioblastoma and clot burden in lower extremeties.
No post cath complications.
He was transitioned to long-term anticoagulation with lovenox 1 mg/kg for continued therapy of his PE indefinitely, given setting of malignancy.
Transthoracic echocardiogram [**2179-8-4**] showed mild right ventricular cavity dilation with free wall hypokinesis and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Chronic: # Glioblastoma:  He is s/p involved-field cranial irradiation with concomitant temozolomide from [**2179-5-4**] to [**2179-6-15**].
He was continued on his home dose of dexamethasone and keppra upon admission, but keppra discontinued prior to discharge per neuro-oncology recommendations, since it may be partially responsible for his spurts of anger, he has not had any seizures yet, and peritumoral edema appears to be controlled well with dexamethasone.

You were admitted after being found to have blood clots in your lungs.
A filter was placed in one of the large vessels in your chest to prevent future blood clots from traveling from your legs to your lungs.
You were found to have low blood pressure in the emergency department, so you were given fluids, and transferred to the CCU for further care.
Medications STARTED: -enoxaparin (lovenox) for treatment of your pulmonary embolism  Medications DISCONTINUED: -levetiracetam (keppra) for seizure prophylaxis  Followup Instructions: Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1844**] for follow-up appointment as soon as you are discharged.
