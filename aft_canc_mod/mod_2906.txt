History of Present Illness: 86 Cantonese-speaking F with active T3 bladder cancer dxed [**2170**], s/p debulking TUR with subsequent XRT who has had persistent bleeding from her bladder tumors requiring multiple transfusions, presents with gross hematuria x 1 month, progressive SOB, pleuritic CP, cough x 1 week.
In addition she complains of cough and SOB with pleuritic CP.
Of note, last [**Month (only) 956**] she presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with acute on chronic gross hematuria with resultant severe symptomatic anemia and cardiac demand ischemia.
Her exertional dyspnea and ischemic EKG findings resolved following PRBC transfusion.
In the ED, she received multiple units RBC, and had frankly bloody urine and no clots in foley.
Has unknown history of pulmonary mets, and has history of MAC and mycobacterium kansasii in her sputum.
Past Medical History: - Bronchiectasis - Bladder cancer diagnosed in [**2170**] - multiple bladder tumors, papillary transitional cell CA, invasive into muscularis propria  - TB about 20 years ago in [**Location (un) 6847**], treated with unknown medication ([**Doctor First Name **] per medicine notes) - Hypertension - taking medication for 7-8 years - Duodenal ulcer - Subendocardial Ischemia/ CAD - Urinary Tract Infection - Porcelain gallbladder .
Physical Exam: 97.8 / 158/69 / 100 / 18 / 100% 2L nc GEN: Pale, in no acute distress, lying in bed comfortably HEENT: No JVD, no LAD, dry mm LUNGS: Rales in right middle area HEART: 2/6 systolic flow murmur radiating up ABD: Soft, quiet BS, ND NT, dull percussion of bladder and also firm to palpation in suprapubic area NEURO: Ambulatory SKIN: No rash   Pertinent Results: Admission labs: 139  106  15 --------------< 94 4.2  26  0.7 CK: 50  MB: Notdone  Trop-T: 0.02 .
Increased interstitial markings and cystic changes within the upper lobes bilaterally, corresponding to patient's known bronchiectasis seen on prior CT scans.
The linear opacity in the right middle lobe is again seen, likely corresponds to the area of atelectasis and/or scar.
No acute superimposed pulmonary process is identified.
Diffuse bronchiectasis.
Infectious etiology should be considered including [**Doctor First Name **], with tuberculosis once again a consideration.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Trends: Hct: 18 - 31.7 CK: 50 - 79 - 75 - 64 Trop: 0.02 - 0.12 - 0.12 - 0.06   Brief Hospital Course: 86 yo Cantonese-speaking F with active T3 bladder cancer dx'ed [**2170**], s/p debulking TUR with subsequent XRT w/ persistent bleeding from her bladder tumors requiring multiple transfusions, presents with gross hematuria and Hct of 18.
# Gross hematuria: Secondary to known bladder tumors.
Also has a known large clot in bladder found on cystoscopy.
Hct continued to trend down slowly w/ persistent hematuria.
Given her history of cardiac ischemia in the setting of anemia, she was transfused for a goal of hct >30.
Continuous bladder irrigation was performed.
Her urine was yellow and she did not have further episodes of hematuria.
# Cards vascular: positive troponin:  Patient has a h/o demand ischemia in the setting of anemia [**3-16**].
She had a mild elevation in her CE which was thought to be [**3-12**] demand ischemia in the setting of low hematocrit.
No ischemic EKG changes.
She did, however, complain of SOB and pleuritic chest pain on admission.
She did not have further complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath thereafter.
# UTI:  Urinalysis in the ED was consistent with infection.
She had no previous positive urine cultures in system to raise suspicion for resistant organism.
Ciprofloxacin was discontinued and ampicillin was started (despite not >100K) given elevated WBC count on admission (no left shift).
# Code: FULL  Medications on Admission: Iron Antihypertensive regimen (unclear)  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - bladder cancer - UTI - anemia Secondary: - TB s/p treatment - HTN - duodenal ulcer - subendocardial ischemia - porcelain gallbladder - s/p TURBT clot evacuation and fulguration.
Please contact your urologist or return to the ED if you experience bloody urine, fevers, chills, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath.
