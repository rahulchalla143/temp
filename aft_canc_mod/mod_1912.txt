92 [**Hospital **] nursing home patient with hx of dementia, CAD, AF, and hypotension presents to the ED via EMS c/o non-radiating 8/10 L-sided chest pain and SOB.

He had an ?abd U/S and a KUB which were both negative for intraabdominal pathology but showed a pleural effusion.
In the ED patient was noted to have ST depressions in V4-6 on ECG.
On CXR he was found to have a large right pleural effusion suspicious for malignancy.
He desatted into thw 80's despite high flow oxygen and given his new code status, he was intubated with etomidate and succ, and then started on a propofol gtt.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 31008**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old Russian-speaking male with a history of dementia, CAD, atrial fibrillation, and hypotension who was found to have a large right sided pleural effusion during work up for chest pain and shortness of breath.
His code status was DNR/DNI, but was reversed for therapeutic thoracentesis.
In the MICU, he remained intubated for hypoxic respiratory distress and required intermittent Levophed for hypotension.
He was extubated on [**2183-5-15**] without complication and remained stable on 2L NC.
Since the initial thoracentesis, he underwent a chest tube placement for the right-sided pleural effusion.
Cytology on pleural fluid was negative for malignancy, but subsequent rigid bronchial biopsy was consistent with non-small cell carcinoma.
In collaboration with the Hematology-Oncology, Radiation Oncology and Pain & Palliative Care teams, the daughter elected to defer any treatment of his lung cancer at this time.
She is aware that he may become symptomatic from his lung mass and that the pleural effusion may reaccumulate.
Atrial fibrillation was well-controlled with digoxin and metoprolol.
His INR was elevated on admission and required reversal with FFP and vitamin K for thoracentesis.
The patient did not undergo staging CT to evaluate for brain or body metastasis of his newly diagnosed lung cancer.
