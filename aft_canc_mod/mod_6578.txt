Pertinent Results: please see OMR   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 5395**] is a 79F with a PMH s/f diabetes presenting with decreased PO intake, diarrhea, and dehydration, also with hypothermia and leukocytosis.
On presentation pt appeared to be septic with possible sources including GI (Cdiff), skin ulcers, pneumonia (effusion may have been parapneumonic).
Due to persistent hypotension, hypoperfusion (altered mental status, anuria and ATN, elevated lactate), pt required fluid resuscitation and pressor support.
Given her pulmonary status, she was electively intubated to allow for aggressive IVF.
She was treated empirically with vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl to empirically cover for  hospital acquired PNA and C. diff.
Given difficulty finding infectious source, pt had CT scan - which showed incidental finding consistent with endometrial cancer, local metastases to bone and possible uterine infection.
She was evaluated by Oncology, Gyn-onc, and gynecology, but given the entire presentation, the family decided to make pt [**Name (NI) 3225**] and avoid furthur diagnostic procedures and treatements.
