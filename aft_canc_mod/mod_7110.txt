Brief Hospital Course: 77 yo male with history of hypogammaglobulinemia, low grade lymphoma and asthma, who presents with SOB, PND, orthopnea with CXR consistent with pulmonary edema and CHF exacerbation.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # acute decompensated systolic CHF: Pt admitted with acutely decompensated CHF, TTE revealed EF of 20% with regional wall motion abnormalities suggestive of ischemic cardiomyopathy.
However, on cardiac catheterization, no evidence of angiographically evident coronary perfusion defects were seen.
Thyroid function tests, iron studies and HIV test were sent as part of work-up for new onset cardiomyopathy.
# metabolic encephalopathy due to hyponatremia: Pt was found to have profoundly altered mental status, with confusion, amnesia and aphasia.
CT non-contrast and CTA/CTP were performed stat, which did not reveal intracranial hemorrhage or ischemia.
The cause of his mental status change was attributed to metabolic changes, most likely hyponatremia.
# Hyponatremia/SIADH: Pt gradually developed hyponatremia to 121 in three days from 135 in the setting of diuresis.
After ruling out stroke, we felt hyponatremia could be an important contributor to his altered mental status.
Of note, pt had normal free cortisol, slightly elevated TSH, but normal T3, T4.
His hyponatremia was thought related with CHF vs SIADH.
Work-up for SIADH included chest CT which showed no changes from previous CT. Pt sodium had normalized by time of discharge and urine osm decreased from 900s to 400s on torsemide.
# A Fib: Pt was in and out of atrial fibrillation during hospitalization.
He was started on metoprolol for rate control, however because he developed symptomatic hypotension, he was cardioverted and started on amiodarone.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # lymphoma: Pt had history of low grade lymphoma, s/p CHOP in 90s.
Given the suspicion of SIADH, a chest CT was performed, which did not reveal significant interval changes.
# Hypogammaglobulinemia: currently receiving IVIG monthly, last dose [**2188-10-14**].
Pt remained afebrile with no indication of active infection.
# Mr. [**Known lastname 107089**] was found to have slightly elevated TSH, normal T3 and T4.
This should be repeated as an outpatient # Free kappa and lambda pending at time of discharge.

You were admitted for a heart failure exacerbation.
You had a cardiac catheterization which showed there were no blockages.
You were found to have a rapid heart rate so you were cardioverted back into normal rhythm.
You also had low sodium which caused you to become confused.
