NO need for SBFT INDICATION: History of esophageal cancer.
Evaluate for anastomotic leak with water-soluble contrast.
There is no evidence of leakage of contrast from the gut lumen, though the study is slightly limited due to the use of water-soluble contrast and the small volume consumed by the patient.
In the lower chest, the contrast collects within gastric pull-up, and does not pass into the small bowel.
After approximately 10 minutes, the patient was re-examined, and contrast did not progress below the diaphragm.
IMPRESSION: Slightly limited exam, but no evidence of leak status post esophagectomy.
Diffuse inferolateral ST-T wave changes which are mild.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2159-5-3**] inferolateral ST-T wave changes are slightly improved.
