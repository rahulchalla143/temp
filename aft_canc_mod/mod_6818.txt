The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
IMPRESSION: Moderate-sized pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Pericadiocentesis: 1- Diagnostic pericardiocentesis with limited removal of 7 CC of markedly viscous fluid.
2- The patient developed a brief vagal episode with heart rate down from 90 bpm to 55-65 bpm and SBP down to 60-70 mmHg (down from 140-160 mmHg).
Limited removal of 7 CC of markedly viscous pericardial fluid.
Specimen was sent for laboratory analysis.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Small pericardial effusion.
No tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2164-9-6**], the effusion appears slightly smaller.
4+   (>10 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI .
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2164-9-10**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is       performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.
Susceptibility will be performed on P.aeruginosa and       S.aureus if sparse growth or greater..       VIRIDANS STREPTOCOCCI.
MODERATE GROWTH STRAIN 3.
NEISSERIA SPECIES.
MODERATE GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2164-9-10**]):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):     ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2164-9-7**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
Brief Hospital Course: A+P: 82 y/o with h/o breast CA, Pancreatic CA, presents with pericardial effusion originally worrisome for tamponade based on OSH echo.
Pt only complains of LE edema, repeat echo without signs of tamponade.
# Pericardial Effusion: Evidence of tamponade physiology On NYP echo.
No evidence of hemodynamic instability, with adequate BP and no symptomatic effects.
Given the size of the effusion w/ absence of a greater deal of hemodynamic compromise, likely more of a chronic, slow growing effusion.
Large differential, but given pancreatic CA and hx of breat CA, malignant pericardial effusion most likely.
Effusion [**2-18**] to thyroid dysfunction in this patient w/ hx of hypothyroidism also a possibility.
No viral illness to suggest post viral etiology, nor MI, uremia, TB, or CKD.
A repeat echo on [**9-6**] was without evidence of tamponade.
Consulted thoracic surgery for eval of pericardial window given likely malignant source of effusion which will likely reaccumulate.
Suggested pericardialcentesis with drain which was performed.
7cc of viscous pericardial effusion was removed.
Cell count and culture results of pericardial effusion as detailed in results section.
The mixed flora in the fluid culture is concerning and blood cultures were obtained to r/o systemic infection.
The pt was without fever or white count to suggest infection but is considered at risk [**2-18**] her fairly recent pallative procedure for pancreatic CA which may have been a nitus for bacterial seeding.
Pt has a f/u echo scheduled as below.
Pt will also f/u with CT [**Doctor First Name **], Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] as detailed below for further discussion of a pericardial window pending the final cytology results.
# Lower Extremity Swelling: [**2-18**] to diastolic heart failure in the setting of tamponade vs. low oncotic pressure in the setting of hypoalbunemia.
No role for diuresis w/ potential tamponade.
Etiology of pericaridial effusion less likely 2.2 Thyroid given viscous loculated nature of fluid.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: ABP  Discharge Diagnosis: Pericardial Effusion Pancreatic cancer   Discharge Condition: good   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you have a pericardial effusion (fluid around the heart).
It is likely that the fluid is there because of the cancer but we have studies of the fluid that are not yet resulted which will give us more definate information.
You had ultrasound of your legs which did not show any blood clots.
The culture of the fluid around your heart had bacteria in it which is concerning that you could have an infection, although you do not have any symptoms compatible with this.
We checked blood cultures to be sure that you don't have a blood stream infection but you did not want to wait for those cultures to be resulted.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you have any concerning symptoms including chest pain, difficulty breathing, fever, light headedness or fainting or any other worrisome symptoms.
