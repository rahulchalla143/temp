========= Radiology ========= CXR [**2189-8-20**] - IMPRESSION: Increased lung consolidation, most likely atlectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Slight increase in size of left pleural effusion.
CT head [**2189-8-20**] - IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or significant edema.
- Bilateral LE ultrasound [**2189-8-20**] - IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT of the right or left leg.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
There is a moderate sized, circumferential pericardial effusion.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
No RA or RV collapse is seen.
IMPRESSION: Moderate pericardial effusion with early signs of impaired ventricular filling.
No echocardiographic signs of frank tamponade.
ECG [**2189-8-20**] - Sinus tachycardia with a premature atrial contraction.
Poor R wave progression.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2189-7-27**] sinus tachycardia and premature atrial contraction are new.
There is decreased QRS voltage.
ECG [**2189-8-21**] - Sinus tachycardia.
Poor R wave progression which is non-diagnostic.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2189-8-20**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
Brief Hospital Course: # Acute renal failure/Hyperkalemia: Patient was admitted to the ICU from the ED.
Creatinine up to 2.7 (up from 2.3 on recent labs), likely secondary to hypovolemia (decreased PO intake in combination with intravascular depletion due to hypoalbuminemia and GI bleed).
Primary cause of death was hyperkalemia from acute renal failure and secondary cause of death was GI bleed and Renal Cell Carcinoma.
# Dyspnea: Has known left-sided pleural effusion with Pleurex catheter in place.
Pulmonary embolism is a possibility given underlying malignancy but lower extremities Patient was not a candidate for anticoagulation given GIB, regardless.
# GI bleeding: Guaiac positive stool but not gross blood per rectum.
Has a history of hemorrhoidal bleeding, but not clear that this is due to hemorrhoids.
# Leukocytosis: Likely leukomoid reaction [**1-3**] underlying malignancy though does now have 1% bandemia (which is new).
