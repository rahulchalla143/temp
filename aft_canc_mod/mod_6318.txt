NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is a large, approximately 53 x 49 mm right frontal mass, the deepest portion of which is hemorrhagic.
It abuts the falx and there is no evidence of bone destruction.
There is massive vasogenic edema contributing to the severe right frontal mass effect.The left lateral ventricle is dilated due to compression of the third ventricle.
This lesion may represent a meningioma with edema perhaps related to drainage into intracerebral veins.
An intraparenchymal lesion (metastasis or malignant glioma), with exophytic growth is the alternate possibility.
Post-op Head CT [**10-16**]: IMPRESSION: Status post craniotomy and resection of the previously noted right frontal hemorrhagic mass, with post-surgical changes and small amount of blood products.
Continued shift of the midline structures to the left side, 1.4 cm with mass effect on the lateral ventricles as well as extensive surrounding edema, persistent but mildly improved compared to the prior study.
MRI [**10-19**]: IMPRESSION: Status post resection of right frontal presumed meningioma with no evidence for residual neoplasm.
Prominent flow voids within the inferior frontal lobe with a large draining vein emanating from it.
Another possibility is a cavernoma with associated DVA.
Recommend correlation with CT angiogram or conventional angiogram for further evaluation.
Small foci of acute ischemia in the right frontal lobe.
She was not transfused, as she was not symptomatic, and does not have a medical history to suggest potential for demand ischemia.
She was seen and evaluated by physical and occupational therapy and determined to be an appropriate candidate for acute rehabilitation.
