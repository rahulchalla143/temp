He reported R hip pain and inability to ambulate, plain film showing a comminuted intertrochanteric fracture of R femur.
Head CT showed no intracranial hemorrhage or fracture.
Appears from PACU notes that patient had large amounts of secretions and unable to wean below PS of 12.
He required 2 doses of neupogen for decreased cell counts and 2 blood transfusions.
He had been on cefepime but it was discontinued as it likely caused his decrease in cell counts.
Readmitted on [**2134-11-15**] due to cough and shortness of breath.
CT chest at that time was negative but showed pleural effusions which were tapped and pt was started on lasix.
He was readmitted on [**12-8**] for cough/fever and nasal washes were RSV+.
Pulm and ID at ths time did not feel there was involvement of the lower respiratory tract, though pulm thought that the chronic cough may be a result of lung scarring/pathology from neoplastic related previous effusion, chronic sinusitis, and reflux.
Repeat CXR was concerning for developing infiltrate and levaquin was continued for a total of 15 day course on [**2134-12-23**].
On [**2134-12-27**], per OMR notes, the patient spiked a fever of 101 with increased cough, productive of clear/whitish sputum.
Past Medical History: -CLL/SLL, on Rituxan/Bedamustine -Recurrent pleural effusions, status post right pleurodesis on [**2131-10-1**].
He has continued with loculated effusion on the right, although currently improved -Hypogammaglobulinemia, receiving IVIG q. monthly during winter months in particular, most recently [**2134-11-17**] -Recurrent pneumonias, requiring admissions periodically -Peptic ulcer disease -Status post right inguinal hernia repair -Status post skin biopsies of the left neck, left shoulder, left ear biopsy consistent with hypertrophic actinic keratoses -Basal cell carcinoma with Mohs procedures of the left chest, left scalp area, area of squamous cell carcinoma noted on the right forehead with Mohs procedure -Status post left hip femoral head stress fracture [**2131-2-14**].
-Status post T5 and T12 vertebral fractures on [**2131-10-23**].
-RSV -IVC compression by RP LAD causing lower extremity edema -Autoimmune hemolytic anemia related to CLL, on prednisone x10 years   Social History: Mr. [**Known lastname 103757**] lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) **].
Physical Exam: Physical Exam: lungs clear anteriorly, ett in place, pale skin, dry MM, abdomen distended, mildly tympanic, hypoactive bowel sounds, 2+ bilateral lower extremity pitting edema, multiple healed scars on scalp from prior excisions  Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS: .
Most recent Imaging: CXR: FINDINGS: As seen on the prior study, there are bilateral pleural effusions and hazy opacity over both lower lungs.
No evidence of acute intracranial abnormality.
Small vessel ischemic disease.
Soft tissue change in the right maxillary sinus and mastoid air cells.
Hip XR: IMPRESSION: Status post open reduction internal fixation of a comminuted right intertrochanteric femoral fracture.
No evidence of hardware complication.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 73 year-old male with a history of CLL complicated by hemolytic anemia, hypogammaglobulinemia, and recent RSV infection/multifocal pna, who presented s/p fall for ORIF and subsequent had failure to extubate.
# Respiratory Infection: The patient had been admitted multiple times over the past two months for shortness of breath and was recently found to be RSV positive.
The patient was difficult to wean off the vent s/p ORIF, which was thought to be secondary to fluid overload and presence of RSV bronchiolitis and multifocal PNA.
He was diuresed and then underwent a CT Chest on [**1-10**], which showed an increase in multifocal lung nodules.
It was suspected that he had a fungal infection other than [**Female First Name (un) **] as his B-GLucan was positive.
# Cough: Continued cough that is likely multifactorial.
Patient had RSV infection while in hospital, presumed fungal pneumonia as well as volume overload with pleural effusions all which are likely contributing to his cough.
We were using 7.5mg codeine after dinner to help his supress his cough enough to sleep through the night.
# Hip fracture: status post R ORIF: The patient presented with right Femur fracture and had an ORIF on [**2135-1-6**].
X-rays were taken and reviewed with [**Date Range **], his fracture is healing well and he has another [**Date Range **] follow up as outpatient.
# Hemolytic anemia: The patient has a history of hemolytic anemia secondary to CLL, for which he takes Prednisone 25 mg daily.
# Pleural effusions: Volume overload versus infectious from probable fungal pneumonia.
He did not have an oxygen requirement at discharge.
The patient had a CT of his abdomen on this admission, which showed an increase in his retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
This was attributed to hospital delerium, hypercalcemia or CLL involvment of the CNS.
His LP showed some atypical lymphocytes but there was not enough for flow.
