HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60-year-old female with metastatic mucosal melanoma admitted today to begin cycle 1 week 1 high-dose IL-2 therapy.
Her oncologic history began in [**2159-9-26**] when she started to have rectal pain initially thought to be hemorrhoids.
On [**2160-3-10**] she underwent surgery with a rectal mass noted.
Biopsy revealed melanoma with tumor cells staining positive for S100, Melan-A, HMB45 anti-tyrosinase.
Torso CT revealed left hilar adenopathy, two indeterminate densities at the right hemithorax and numerous hepatic lesions highly suggestive of metastatic disease.
On [**2160-4-11**] she started temozolomide 5 days on and 23 days off with radiation to the rectal region for pain relief.
She completed 2 cycles of Temodar in [**Month (only) 116**] with torso CT showing interval progression in the perirectal adenopathy and liver lesions.
Her nuclear stress test revealed no EKG changes but there was a perfusion defect.
It was unclear if this was artifact so she underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2160-6-30**] revealing a 30% to 40% stenosis of the LAD felt to be hemodynamically insignificant.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Melanoma as above, osteopenia, anxiety disorder with insomnia, status post TAH-BSO, status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy in [**2154**], history of low blood pressure.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Well-appearing female in no acute distress.
LYMPH NODES:  No cervical, supraclavicular or bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema.
Her course was also complicated by acute pulmonary edema with respiratory distress syndrome.
Hypotension was related to capillary leak syndrome from IL-2 therapy.
On treatment day 5 she was noted to be lethargic and confused consistent with toxic encephalopathy.
IL-2 therapy was held throughout that day given mental status changes.
On treatment day 6 she was tachypneic with hypoxia and chest x- ray confirmed acute pulmonary edema.
She initially responded to nebs and Lasix but again became tachypnea with hypoxia requiring an ICU transfer.
In addition she became hypotensive at that point requiring initiation of Neo- Synephrine blood pressure support again.
She was aggressively diuresed and ruled out for an infection.
She had some borderline oxygen saturations and was thus sent home with home oxygen therapy on [**2160-7-13**] after otherwise recovering from treatment.
Other side effects from IL-2 this week included nausea and vomiting improved with antiemetic therapy; diarrhea; fatigue and development of an erythematous pruritic skin rash.
Her rectal pain was managed with fentanyl patch, p.r.n.
During this week she developed acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of 1.3 improved to 0.4 at the time of discharge.
She had associated oliguria and mild metabolic acidosis noted with a minimum bicarb of 18.
IV fluids were significantly decreased given acute pulmonary edema in the setting of renal failure.
She developed transaminitis with a peak ALT of 234 and a peak AST of 151, both improved within normal limits at the time of discharge.
She developed hyperbilirubinemia with a peak bilirubin of 2.6 improved to normal at the time of discharge.
She developed mild thrombocytopenia with platelet count low of 132,000 without evidence of bleeding.
She had no coagulopathy or myocarditis noted.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Metastatic melanoma status post cycle 1 week 1 high-dose IL-2 therapy complicated by shock, acute pulmonary edema and acute renal failure.
