Admission Date:  [**2157-9-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2157-10-3**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**] Chief Complaint: hypotension, hematuria   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: CVL placement with subsequent removal  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 3314**] is a 85 yo male recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] to an extended care facility after being treated for hypoxia, hyponatremia, and acute renal failure.
He was found to have an aspiration pneumonia and was given a two week course of Levo/Flagyl during his last admission.
Per the rehab notes, the pt had an episode of worsening hypoxia and hematuria and was brought to the ED.
While in the ED, the pt became transiently hypotensive with a BP of 70's systolic (initially 100/60).
In fact, the ICU team believed that some of his hypoxia could be due to fluid overload, so he did receive some diuresis.
These were subsequently discontinued as the patient had no evidence of sepsis and was able to maintain his blood pressure following fluid resuscitation.
+ lung nodules, + abdominal LAD.
Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in heme-onc -Benign prostatic hypertrophy s/p TURP -Bladder calculi s/p removal -Dyslipidemia -Mild AI -Gastritis by EGD   Social History: Widowed, 3 sons (2 in [**State 2690**], one here).
Used to own a small hardware store.
2+ pitting edema to thighs.
No rash but scattered scabs & ecchymoses.
NEURO: A/O X3, no focal deficits.
Speaking clearly & in full sentences as above   Pertinent Results: Labs notable for elevated proBNP, elevated AP, elevated creatinine to 1.5 (1.0 at discharge) and decreased hct to 28.4 from mid 30's.
[**2157-9-20**] CXR: Increased left retrocardiac opacity in comparison to prior exam, which may represent an area of volume loss or consolidation.
[**2157-8-31**] LUNG SCAN: Perfusion images in the same 8 views show demonstrate subsegmental defects in the right upper lung and defects in the bases Chest x-ray shows patch infiltatrates and yesterday's CXR reveals pleural effusions.
The above findings are consistent with a low likelihood ratio for recent pulmonary embolism.
IMPRESSION:  Low likelihood ratio for recent pulmonary embolism.
[**2157-9-2**] RUQ US: No evidence of cholelithiasis.
[**2157-9-1**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[**2157-9-7**] video swallow: no evidence of aspiration .
Renal US ([**9-22**]): No evidence of hydronephrosis or stones.
CXR ([**9-20**]): Increased left retrocardiac opacity in comparison to prior exam, which may represent an area of volume loss or consolidation.
Mild interstitial pulmonary edema has worsened exaggerated by slightly lower lung volumes due to persistent bibasilar atelectasis.
Small left pleural effusion increased.
No pneumothorax.
Tracheal deviation is probably a function of upper thoracic scoliosis and tortuous head and neck vessels.
CXR ([**9-26**]): There is a thoracic scoliosis convex to the right.
There is cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular engorgement and bilateral pleural effusions consistent with CHF.
In addition, there are bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm likely due to a combination of left pleural effusion and atelectasis or consolidation in the left lower lobe.
The findings are similar to those noted on the prior study of [**2157-9-21**] but with probable increased patchy opacity at the right lung base.
Lower extremity ultrasound ([**9-27**]): No evidence of DVT bilaterally.
There are bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
In conjunction with ground-glass opacity and areas of intralobular septal thickening, these findings are consistent with CHF.
There are diffuse osseous sclerotic metastases, as identified on recent bone scan from [**2157-9-2**].
CXR ([**9-29**]): There is no significant change in the appearance of the normal heart and bilateral pleural effusions as well as the left lower lobe consolidation which is most likely _____ atelectasis but there is improvement of the bilateral pulmonary edema.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Layering echogenic material in urinary bladder that most likely represents presence of hemorrhage.
Microbiology: C. diff negative X 2 Sputum culture pending but multiple organisms on gram stain from [**10-1**] MRSA in urine from [**9-20**] but not present on repeat urine culture [**9-28**]   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 3314**] is an 85 yo male with history of metastatic prostate cancer, bladder varices, and chronic bladder obstruction who presents as a transfer from the MICU for hypotension, now resolved, and hematuria, thought to be chronic.
* After an extensive discussion between Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **], the patient, and the patient's son, it was decided that they would not like to have any further studies or lab draws.
The patient's current problems of acute renal failure and thrombocytopenia in conjunction with hypoxia have an unclear etiology.
We have tried various interventions without success.
# Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine is climbing and was 3.3 yesterday.
The Renal service evaluated the patient and suspect acute tubular necrosis in this patient.
However, it is difficult to provide fluids to the patient as he has congestive heart failure with hypoxia as well.
The Urology team was involved and changed Mr. [**Known lastname 40282**] foley catheter over the weekend due to concern for obstruction.
This foley should remain in place due to clot/hematoma seen within the bladder.
However, a clear, reversible cause of renal failure was not found in this gentleman.
He did not initially respond to fluid boluses, and we were hesitant to further diurese him due to his rapidly rising creatinine.
# Metastatic prostate cancer: The patient has known metastatic prostate cancer with bony metastases.
His pain is typically well-controlled.
We are discharging him on a regimen of tylenol around the clock with an order for additional if his pain is not well-controlled.
In addition, the patient has morphine elixir ordered for severe pain.
He does have congestive heart failure evident on chest CT, but due to his renal failure, we did not feel comfortable diuresing him.
He does not have evidence of deep venous thromboses.
# Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has continued to decline.
This is likely related to his underlying malignancy.
It is also possible that he has some marrow infiltration, though his WBC and RBC counts are not as low as one would expect with this.
He has chronic hematuria and some bloody sputum production, but he does not have other active bleeding.
# Swallowing difficulties: The patient reports that he is having difficulty swallowing.
However, it is unclear to me whether this represents true difficulty swallowing or disinterest in eating.
Cepacol 2 mg Lozenge Sig: One (1) Lozenge Mucous membrane PRN (as needed) as needed for sore throat.
