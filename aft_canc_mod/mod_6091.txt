Admission Date:  [**2183-4-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2183-5-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2125-7-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Vicodin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3016**] Chief Complaint: SOB, hypoxia, tachycardia after debulking nephrectomy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left debulking nephrectomy Flexible Bronchoscopy Left chest tube placement and removal   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 1557**] is a 57-year-old female with renal cell carcinoma metastatic to bone and lung (including mediastinal dz compressing airways) who recently presented with cough and episodes of hemoptysis found to have a left renal mass and lung metastasis.
The renal mass was biopsied in [**2183-2-9**] and proved to be renal cell carcinoma.
She had bronchoscopy with argon laser ablation and resection of endobronchial tumor, along with y-stent placement on [**2183-3-21**].
Further imaging studies of the brain showed a lytic lesion in the skull measuring 5 cm.
There is also palpable abnormality in the skull treated with palliative radiation therapy.
Chest tube was pulled on [**4-23**] wuth subsequent CXR revealing 30% pneumothorax and new atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
New tachycardia to the 130s prompted a repeat CXR which demonstrated new opacity over entire left lung field.
In [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she had bronchoscopy on [**2183-4-24**] which revealed thick green copious secretions completely obstructing the left limb of the Y-stent and had therapeutic cleaning both of the right and left limb of the Y-stent.
Pain well controlled in abdomen at incision site but ahs increased pain with coughing.

There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
[**4-22**] CXR:FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-21**], following placement of the chest tube to waterseal, there may be a very tiny left apical pneumothorax medially, though this would be of no clinical significance.
The striking prominence of the hila bilaterally is consistent with extensive lymphadenopathy seen on the CT of [**2183-4-11**].
[**4-24**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Interval opacification of the left hemithorax likely related to significant increase in left pleural effusion with a component of atelectasis of the left upper and lower lobes.
Right posterior acetabular and left anterosuperior acetabular lytic lesions, most likely representing renal metastases.
These lesion were better depicted on the [**2183-4-11**] CT scan.
Equivocal lucency in the left anterior/subtrochanteric femur without definite corresponding lesion on the recent CT scan.
On [**2183-4-23**], the chest tube was removed, and post-pull CXR showed a 20-30% PTX and new left lower lobe collapse, likely from mucus plugging.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course: On [**4-21**] she had a radical left nephrectomy which involved entry into the chest and placement of a Chest tube; transfused 2 units in the OR.
Chest tube was pulled on [**4-23**] wuth subsequent CXR revealing 30% pneumothorax and new atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
New tachycardia to the 130s prompted a repeat CXR which demonstrated new opacity over entire left lung field.
Pt oxygen requirement improved over [**4-24**], and plan to call out of the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**4-25**] was delayed by tachycardia and poor venous access.
Sinus Tachycardia into the 130s improved s/p 2L NS.
Her pain was controlled with Dilaudid PCA initially which was subsequently changed to MS Contin [**Hospital1 **] with PO dilaudid for breakthrough.
She was seen by orthoopedics to clarify weightbearing status since had hip metastases with cortical involvement on CT. Orthopedics recommended weight bearing as tolerated using walker and she cleared physical therapy for discharge home with home PT.
She was instructed to follow up with Ortho (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4223**]) and have serial CTs on time course per their recommendations to monitor metastatic disease.
